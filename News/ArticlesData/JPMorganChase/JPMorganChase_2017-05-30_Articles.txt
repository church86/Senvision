Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print NEW YORK — U.S. stock indexes edged lower for the second day in a row Wednesday as a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for technology companies canceled out gains for drugmakers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell hard as executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. An eight-day winning streak for technology companies ended. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drugmakers, and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The New York Stock Exchange was evenly split between gainers and losers. RELATED: Searchable stock indexes “The stock market has been strong and all the while bond yields have dropped during the year,” signaling caution about the economy, said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Management. “In the next couple of months we’re going to solve which is right: the bond market or the stock market.” The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 1.11 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65. The Nasdaq composite fell 4.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,198.52. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks slipped 0.99 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,370.21. Banks skidded a day earlier as bond yields dropped, which hurts banks by forcing interest rates on loans lower. Yields were little changed Wednesday, but financial firms fell again as investors worried that banks’ revenue from trading stocks, bonds and currencies is going to weaken in the second quarter. At a financial industry conference in New York, Marianne Lake, JPMorgan Chase’s chief financial officer, said JPMorgan’s trading revenue is down about 15 percent this quarter because of a drop in fixed-income trading. She said that was because of low interest rates and remarkably low market volatility. “There is not a lot to trade around,” she said. “People have cash but no conviction.” At a different industry event Wednesday, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said second-quarter trading revenue will fall 10 percent compared to a year ago. The banking industry had an outstanding first quarter, and trading was a key reason. JPMorgan Chase fell $1.75, or 2.1 percent, to $82.15 and Bank of America lost 43 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $22.41. Capital One slumped $1.36, or 1.7 percent, to $76.92 and Goldman Sachs, which saw its vaunted trading business hit a speed bump in the first quarter, gave up $7.16, or 3.3 percent, to $211.26. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.21 percent. Technology companies turned lower. The tech sector has reached its highest levels since the dot-com boom and companies like Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook have done far better than the rest of the market in 2017. Apple and Facebook are up 32 percent this year, and Alphabet is up 25 percent. All three slid Wednesday. Pfizer rose 52 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $32.65 and Irish drugmaker Perrigo climbed $4,93, or 7.3 percent, to $72.85 after its first-quarter report was better than expected. Health care products maker Johnson & Johnson advanced $1.14 to $128.25. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.34, or 2.7 percent, to $48.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, fell $1.53, or 3 percent, to $50.31 a barrel in London. Energy stocks continued to decline. Exxon Mobil sank 60 cents to $80.50 and Hess declined 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $45.89. Michael Kors Holdings hit a five-year low after it said it will close up to 125 stores as its sales have remained weak. The luxury retailer said sales at older stores dropped in its latest quarter and investors were disappointed with its projections for the current quarter. The stock tumbled $3.09, or 8.5 percent, to $33.18. Solar power companies sank as investors wondered if President Donald Trump will seek to remove the U.S. from the Paris climate change accords. Officials from the European Union said the EU and China will maintain their commitments to the pact. Shares of First Solar, the largest U.S. solar company, declined 99 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $38.51. SunPower fell 28 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $7.87 while solar wafer maker Canadian Solar retreated 73 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $12.81. The dollar slipped to 110.57 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro rose to $1.1246 from $1.1188. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Heating oil gave up 3 cents to $1.52 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 7 cents to $3.07 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold rose $9.70 to $1,265.40 an ounce. Silver fell 2 cents to $17.41 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.58 a pound. European stocks gave up an early gain. The DAX in Germany remained up 0.1 percent, but France’s CAC 40 lost 0.4 percent and the British FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index dipped 0.1 percent and South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.2 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong inched down 0.1 percent.

Ogg May 31, 2017 1:20 pm EDT Print Email Tweet In late 2016 the markets rallied and rallied, and then they kept rallying into 2017. The financial services sector was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Trump bump. The nation’s top money center banks fared incredibly well because they had the most to gain from deregulation and in a gradually rising interest rate environment. Now zoom forward to the end of May. Things are different, and that is right before the slow summer months. The Dow is still up 6.4% and the S&P 500 Index up 8% so far in 2017, but the financials have barely risen, and some are still down. On top of other growth drivers affecting the banks now looking less rosy, both Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) have harmed the financials by talking down expectations on trading revenues in the second quarter. JPMorgan was signaling a 15% drop in trading revenues so far in the second quarter due to lower volatility. Bank of America’s trading revenues were also indicated to be lower by CEO Brian Moynihan. Other recent concerns have weighed on bank stocks. An unhealthy credit environment in car loans being more risky and delinquent has been hard to ignore, and credit card delinquency rates were also higher in the most recent quarter. On top of this new down-draft of news, some investors have dialed down expectations on just how aggressive the Federal Reserve will be on interest rate hikes in 2017 and in 2018, at the same time that growth expectations just are not coming in as high as the markets had previously hoped. Many of the Trump agenda efforts have also been pushed back on when and dialed down on how big, and many investors still wonder if any big changes will be seen this year or next. And on the long-term interest rate front, rates just haven’t stayed higher and that is a risk to the markets, based on growth expectations. The 10-year Treasury note was last seen with a 2.21% yield, when  yield — a measure of inflation expectations that also influences rates on different types of credit — slipped one basis point to 2.21% after having hit 2.60% in March of this year. And there is one more consideration about why the bank stock performance is so troubling. Bull markets usually cannot continue without the performance of the financial sector. They are large in value and their earnings broadly reflect the overall economic picture. Bank of America shares were last seen trading down almost 2.4% at $22.30. The bank’s stock chart matters here as the $20 handle has been a hard floor of support going all the way back to December. The shares are down from a 52-week and multiyear high of $25.80, and its consensus analyst price target is still up at about $26. Bank of America’s book value per share was listed as $24.19 in April, with a tangible book value per share of $17.14. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C), the money center bank that trades at the biggest book value discount, was trading down just over 2% at $60.40 on Wednesday. It is down from a 52-week high of $62.69 but its shares were still up over 3% in 2017. Citi’s book value per share in April was $75.86, with a tangible book value of $65.94 per share. JPMorgan was down 1.8% at $82.37 a share. Team Dimon’s shares were last seen down almost 3% so far in 2017. Its book value was listed as $64.68 per share in April, and its tangible book value was $52.04 per share. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) traded down 3% at $211.89. The top financial stock of the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down more than 8% so far in 2017, making it the worst of the big money center banks and brokerages featured here. Goldman Sachs has a serious pivot level to watch closely around $210. Goldman Sachs listed its book value at $184.98 in mid-April. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) was last seen down 2% at $41.44, but it was literally at a flat line for performance in 2017. This stock is up over 50% from a year ago. Morgan Stanley’s book value and tangible book value per common share at the end of the first quarter were listed as $37.48 and $32.49, respectively. Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC) traded down almost 1.8% to $51.22, and the stock is now down 5.3% so far in 2017 and down about 10% over the past quarter. With its problems of the unapproved bank account openings for many customers, the stock is up the least of the entire group here, with a 2.5% gain from a year ago. Wells Fargo continues to trade at the largest book value premium versus peers, with its stated book value at the end of the first quarter at $35.70 per share. Its tangible book value per share was $29.79. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Jon C.

Executives of the two biggest US banks said second-quarter trading revenue was set to drop at least 10 percent, according to media reports. In 2.45pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.15 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.3 percent. In 2.30pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced shed 0.21 percent. The Dow weakened as slides in shares of Goldman Sachs and those of JPMorgan Chase, down 3.4 percent and 2.4 percent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Pfizer and those of Johnson & Johnson, recently up 1.7 percent and 1 percent respectively. Shares of Bank of America dropped 2.9 percent as of 2.58pm in New York. In other earnings disappointments, shares of Michael Kors sank, down 9 percent as of 3.07pm, after the luxury fashion retailer offered a full-year earnings outlook that fell short of expectations. It also announced plans to close between as many as 125 of its full-price retail stores over the next two years. Also sliding was the price of oil amid fresh concern about the global glut. “There doesn’t seem to be an end to supply out there,” Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, told Bloomberg. “And demand is not exactly rip-roaring.” Meanwhile, a National Association of Realtors report showed its pending home sales index fell 1.3 percent to 109.8 in April, from a downwardly revised 111.3 in March. Significantly weak supply levels are spurring deteriorating affordability conditions, Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said in the report. “Much of the country for the second straight month saw a pullback in pending sales as the rate of new listings continues to lag the quicker pace of homes coming off the market,” according to Yun. “Realtors are indicating that foot traffic is higher than a year ago, but it’s obviously not translating to more sales.” “Prospective buyers are feeling the double whammy this spring of inventory that’s down 9 percent from a year ago and price appreciation that’s much faster than any rise they’ve likely seen in their income,” Yun noted. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.21 percent decline from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index fell 0.1 percent, while France’s CAC40 Index dropped 0.4 percent. Germany’s DAX Index rose 0.1 percent. A YouGov poll showed that UK Prime Minister Theresa May could lose control of parliament in in next month’s election. When asked by a reporter if she would resign if she lost seats, May dodged the question, saying that the only poll that mattered was the election on June 8, Reuters reported.

JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 per cent decline in trading revenue in the current quarter compared with last year, while Bank of America said trading revenue in the second quarter was on track to be 10 to 12 per cent lower than last year. Financials rallied more than 20 per cent in the wake of the US presidential election on hopes of fiscal stimulus and deregulation under President Donald Trump, but they have struggled in recent weeks. The sector is now down 0.3 per cent on the year. “All the things that Trump told us were going to happen, which was infrastructure spend, deregulation, tax reform, people don’t believe any of those will happen, certainly the magnitude and with the speed the market had originally priced in,” said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities at BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago. “That is why you’ve seen a lot of the move back, specifically banks.” Measures of market volatility are at rock-bottom, hitting trading desks at big banks. The US stock market's main gauge of investor anxiety closed at its lowest level in over two decades on May 8 and has not topped its long-term average of 20 since November. It did, however, hit a seven-day high of 11.30 yesterday. JPMorgan shares lost 2.1 per cent while Bank of America was down 1.9 per cent as the two biggest weights on the S&P 500. Goldman Sachs fell 3.3 per cent, the biggest drag on the Dow. Defensive plays such as utilities, up 0.46 per cent and telecoms up 0.35 per cent, were the bright spots as enthusiasm fades for sectors that would benefit from Trump policies. Energy stocks, down 0.4 per cent, also lost ground. Oil prices touched a three-week low as rising output from Nigeria and Libya fuelled concerns that Opec-led output cuts are being undermined. US crude settled down 2.7 per cent at US$48.32 (RM206.75) a barrel and Brent settled 3 per cent lower at US$50.10. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20.82 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 21,008.65, the S&P 500 lost 1.1 points, or 0.05 per cent, to 2,411.81 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.67 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 6,198.52. Shares of Michael Kors plunged 8.5 per cent to US$33.18. The luxury fashion retailer gave a bleak full-year forecast and said it would shut more than 100 full-price retail stores in the next two years. Mallinckrodt closed down 1.2 per cent at US$43.13 after sources said the drugmaker is exploring a sale of its generic drug unit for as much as US$2 billion. Analog Devices rose 1.1 percent to US$85.76 after the chipmaker's quarterly results came in above expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.04-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows. About 7.85 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, above the 6.72 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Malaysia Airlines close to deal for more widebody Airbus planes Pound falls after London terror attacks raise political tensions Ringgit opens higher against US dollar PBOC has economy's back even as it squeezes leverage from market Oil subdued as rising US output undermines Opec effort to cut supply Ringgit likely to trade higher versus US dollar next week RHB-AmBank to take No. 1 spot in asset management, insurance, broking Petronas Q1 2017 pre-tax profit more than doubles to RM15.5b British pound in thrall to election projections as market jitters rise Bursa to be firmer next week Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: With rave reviews, 'Wonder Woman' readies to launch Reuters Video: Francois Ozon's 'L'Amant Double' shocks at Cannes Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • U.S. stock indexes edged lower for the second day in a row Wednesday as a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for technology companies canceled out gains for drugmakers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell hard as executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. An eight-day winning streak for technology companies ended. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drugmakers, and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The New York Stock Exchange was evenly split between gainers and losers. "The stock market has been strong and all the while bond yields have dropped during the year," signaling caution about the economy, said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Management. "In the next couple of months we're going to solve which is right: the bond market or the stock market." VIDEOS TOP JOBS The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 1.11 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65. The Nasdaq composite fell 4.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,198.52. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks slipped 0.99 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,370.21. Banks skidded a day earlier as bond yields dropped, which hurts banks by forcing interest rates on loans lower. Yields were little changed Wednesday, but financial firms fell again as investors worried that banks' revenue from trading stocks, bonds and currencies is going to weaken in the second quarter. At a financial industry conference in New York, Marianne Lake, JPMorgan Chase's chief financial officer, said JPMorgan's trading revenue is down about 15 percent this quarter because of a drop in fixed-income trading. She said that was because of low interest rates and remarkably low market volatility. "There is not a lot to trade around," she said. "People have cash but no conviction." At a different industry event Wednesday, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said second-quarter trading revenue will fall 10 percent compared to a year ago. The banking industry had an outstanding first quarter, and trading was a key reason. JPMorgan Chase fell $1.75, or 2.1 percent, to $82.15 and Bank of America lost 43 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $22.41. Capital One slumped $1.36, or 1.7 percent, to $76.92 and Goldman Sachs, which saw its vaunted trading business hit a speed bump in the first quarter, gave up $7.16, or 3.3 percent, to $211.26. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.21 percent. Technology companies turned lower. The tech sector has reached its highest levels since the dot-com boom and companies like Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook have done far better than the rest of the market in 2017. Apple and Facebook are up 32 percent this year, and Alphabet is up 25 percent. All three slid Wednesday. Pfizer rose 52 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $32.65 and Irish drugmaker Perrigo climbed $4,93, or 7.3 percent, to $72.85 after its first-quarter report was better than expected. Health care products maker Johnson & Johnson advanced $1.14 to $128.25. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.34, or 2.7 percent, to $48.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, fell $1.53, or 3 percent, to $50.31 a barrel in London. Energy stocks continued to decline. Exxon Mobil sank 60 cents to $80.50 and Hess declined 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $45.89. Michael Kors Holdings hit a five-year low after it said it will close up to 125 stores as its sales have remained weak. The luxury retailer said sales at older stores dropped in its latest quarter and investors were disappointed with its projections for the current quarter. The stock tumbled $3.09, or 8.5 percent, to $33.18. Solar power companies sank as investors wondered if President Donald Trump will seek to remove the U.S. from the Paris climate change accords. Officials from the European Union said the EU and China will maintain their commitments to the pact. Shares of First Solar, the largest U.S. solar company, declined 99 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $38.51. SunPower fell 28 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $7.87 while solar wafer maker Canadian Solar retreated 73 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $12.81. The dollar slipped to 110.57 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro rose to $1.1246 from $1.1188. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Heating oil gave up 3 cents to $1.52 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 7 cents to $3.07 per 1,000 cubic feet. » Next page...

By WallaceWitkowski Reporter MarkDeCambre Editor’s note: Chicago-area economic activity rose to a 2½-year high in May. MNI Indicator earlier released an incorrect report on Chicago-area economic activity, representing a fall in May. The Chicago business barometer, or Chicago PMI, rose to 59.4 in May from 58.3. U.S. stocks closed lower on Wednesday, but off their worst levels of the session, notching gains for the month as a slump in bank shares and a mixed reading of economic reports weighed on investor sentiment. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.37% fell 1.11 points, or less than 0.1%, to close at 2,411.80, recovering from an earlier 9-point deficit, with only four of the market gauge’s 11 sectors closing lower. The financial sector finished down 0.8%, representing the worst performer, and energy shares closed down 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.29%  closed down 20.82 points, or 0.1%, at 21,008.65, with shares of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.51% and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -0.79% dragging blue chips firmly into the red with more than 2% losses. Combined, the pair of bank stocks contributed to the lion’s share of the Dow’s loss. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.94% after briefly touching an intraday high of 6,221.99, finished down 4.67 points, or less than 0.1%, at 6,198.52. For the month, the Nasdaq has been the best-performing among major indexes, up 2.5% in May, followed by a 1.2% gain for the S&P 500. Both indexes had their best monthly percentage gains since February. The Dow hung on to a meager gain of 0.3%. Financials took a hit because two of the largest U.S. banks signaled signs of a trading slowdown on the same day, said Ian Winer, head of the equities division at Wedbush Securities. Both J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America Corp. BAC, -0.80%  cautioned at an industry conferences on Wednesday that trading is weakening in the second quarter. Couple that with the drop in oil prices and reports that former FBI Director James Comey will publicly testify that President Donald Trump pushed him to end the probe into former national-security adviser Michael Flynn and you have a market that is going to sell off, Winer said. Energy shares continued their downtrend Wednesday with U.S. crude-oil prices CLN7, +1.22% dipping below $48 and settling down 2.7% at $48.32 a barrel. “Banks are being cautious and that has to make people a little nervous, and the market continues to plow money into the same names everyday,” said Winer, citing stocks like Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.08% Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +0.89% GOOGL, +0.79% Tesla Inc. TSLA, -0.15%  and Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.50% all of which are up 25% or more for the year. “I’m concerned that there are quantitative models out there that are ‘buy high, buy higher’ so you have this strange phenomenon feeding on itself where [those stocks] become a bigger part of the S&P 500,” he said. The benchmarks took a decided turn for the worse Wednesday after a reading for pending-home sales came in below expectations. Pending-home sales from the National Association of Realtors fell 1.3% to a level of 109.8 from a reduction in the March reading. Meanwhile, a gauge of economic health, the Chicago business barometer, or Chicago PMI, rose to 59.4 in May, its highest level in 2½ years. Earlier, reporting agency MNI Indicators had mistakenly said the gauge fell to 55.2. Any reading over 50 indicates improving conditions. Stocks pared gains slightly following the corrected PMI reading. The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, or anecdotal report of regional conditions, said the economy is still growing at a “modest or moderate” pace, appearing to support a June rate increase. Even so, the market may be at a tipping point where a recent trend of soft data may support bearish views that economic growth doesn’t warrant two additional rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2017, said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. The Fed is widely expected to lift rates in June by a quarter point. “The question the market is grappling with is, is the Fed raising rates in an environment in which perhaps the economic data are weakening more than you should see for a rate-hike cycle?” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The Fed has been clear [in past policy statements] that weaker data are just noise and that we are moving toward a stronger economic backdrop but at this stage the dollar should rise; also, we see 10-year yields which haven’t moved higher,” she said. Indeed, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.48% hit a five-week low, dropping below 2.20% on Wednesday, while the dollar, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.03% a gauge of the buck against six rivals, traded lower for most of the day but was last up 0.1%. “People are looking for reasons to buy, but it doesn’t take a lot for markets to tumble back,” Cieszynski said. “I think some traders are starting to throw in the towel.” Need to know: Tech rally overdone?

Fed speakers: Among Fed speakers, San Francisco Fed President John Williams will give a speech on “global economic and financial challenges” at the Bank of Korea International Conference 2017 in Seoul, South Korea, at 8:10 p.m. Eastern. Stocks to watch: Shares of Michael Kors Holdings Inc. KORS, -0.09% finished down 8.5% after the maker of high-end accessories and clothing posted a loss for its fiscal fourth quarter and spoke of a challenging market. Energy stocks also performed poorly on the slip in oil, but pared losses a bit by the close. Shares of Transocean Ltd. RIG, -2.17%  declined 1.9%, Chesapeake Energy Corp. CHK, -2.75%  dipped 0.8%, and Murphy Oil Corp. MUR, -2.87%  fell 1.1%. Vera Bradley Inc. VRA, +1.60%  shares finished 11% higher, despite a weak quarterly report. Other markets: Stocks in Asia ADOW, -0.38%  had a mixed day, while Chinese equities inched higher after a gauge of manufacturing beat forecasts. European stocks SXXP, +0.23%  finished fractionally lower. The FTSE 100 index UKX, +0.05%  gave back earlier gains, closing in the red on fresh parliamentary election jitters. The pound GBPUSD, -0.1629%  was trading around $1.29, in up-and-down trade for sterling ahead of the coming U.K. election. Gold prices GCN7, +0.23%  settled up 0.8% at $1,275.40 an ounce as the dollar slumped, giving dollar-priced assets room to climb, because a weaker dollar makes those assets more attractive to buyers using weaker currencies. —Barbara Kollmeyer in Madrid contributed to this article.

Both JPMorgan and Bank of America have seen their share prices drop in early trading on Wednesday. JPMorgan was down about 1.8% and Bank of America was down about 3.3% as of 10:40 a.m. ET. The shares started to fall Wednesday morning following comments at an investor conference from executives of both firms. Markets revenue at JPMorgan is down 15% so far in the second quarter compared to last year, CFO Marianne Lake said, according to Reuters. Lake points to lower volatility this year, compared to the tumultuous situation surrounding Brexit in 2016. She added that U.S. economic growth is "solid, not stellar," which has contributed to JPMorgan's lower revenue. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan also said trading revenues would be lower in the second quarter compared to last year, according to Stephen Alpher of Seeking Alpha. Other banks are down as well. Goldman Sachs is down about 4%, Citigroup is down about 2.4% and Wells Fargo is down about 1.2% on Wednesday. The S&P 500 is down only 0.25%.

JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 percent decline in trading revenue in the current quarter compared with last year, while Bank of America said trading revenue in the second quarter was on track to be 10 to 12 percent lower than last year. Financials rallied more than 20 percent in the wake of the U.S. presidential election on hopes of fiscal stimulus and deregulation under President Donald Trump, but they have struggled in recent weeks. The sector is now down 0.3 percent on the year. "All the things that Trump told us were going to happen, which was infrastructure spend, deregulation, tax reform, people don't believe any of those will happen, certainly the magnitude and with the speed the market had originally priced in," said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities at BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago. "That is why you've seen a lot of the move back, specifically banks." Measures of market volatility are at rock-bottom, hitting trading desks at big banks. The U.S. stock market's main gauge of investor anxiety closed at its lowest level in over two decades on May 8 and has not topped its long-term average of 20 since November. It did, however, hit a seven-day high of 11.30 on Wednesday. JPMorgan shares lost 2.1 percent while Bank of America was down 1.9 percent as the two biggest weights on the S&P 500. Goldman Sachs fell 3.3 percent, the biggest drag on the Dow. Defensive plays such as utilities, up 0.46 percent and telecoms, up 0.35 percent, were the bright spots as enthusiasm fades for sectors that would benefit from Trump policies. Energy stocks, down 0.4 percent, also lost ground. Oil prices touched a three-week low as rising output from Nigeria and Libya fueled concerns that OPEC-led output cuts are being undermined. U.S. crude settled down 2.7 percent at $48.32 a barrel and Brent settled 3 percent lower at $50.1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65, the S&P 500 lost 1.1 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,411.81 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.67 points, or 0.08 percent, to 6,198.52. Shares of Michael Kors plunged 8.5 percent to $33.18. The luxury fashion retailer gave a bleak full-year forecast and said it would shut more than 100 full-price retail stores in the next two years. Mallinckrodt closed down 1.2 percent at $43.13 after sources said the drugmaker is exploring a sale of its generic drug unit for as much as $2 billion. Analog Devices rose 1.1 percent to $85.76 after the chipmaker's quarterly results came in above expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.04-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows.

JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 percent decline in trading revenue compared with last year, while Bank of America said trading revenue in the second quarter was on track to be 10 to 12 percent lower than last year. Financials rallied more than 20 percent in the wake of the U.S. presidential election on hopes of fiscal stimulus and deregulation under President Donald Trump but have struggled in recent weeks. The sector is now down 0.8 percent on the year.

JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 percent decline in trading revenue compared with last year, while Bank of America said trading revenue in the second quarter was on track to be 10 to 12 percent lower than last year. Financials rallied more than 20 percent in the wake of the U.S. presidential election on hopes of fiscal stimulus and deregulation under President Donald Trump but have struggled in recent weeks. The sector is now down 0.8 percent on the year. "It is just investors' confidence in the Trump policies is waning, it continues to wane," said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.

Both JPMorgan and Bank of America have seen their share prices drop in early trading on Wednesday. JPMorgan was down about 1.8% and Bank of America was down about 3.3% as of 10:40 a.m. ET. The shares started to fall Wednesday morning following comments at an investor conference from executives of both firms. Markets revenue at JPMorgan is down 15% so far in the second quarter compared to last year, CFO Marianne Lake said, according to Reuters. Lake points to lower volatility this year, compared to the tumultuous situation surrounding Brexit in 2016. She added that U.S. economic growth is "solid, not stellar," which has contributed to JPMorgan's lower revenue. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan also said trading revenues would be lower in the second quarter compared to last year, according to Stephen Alpher of Seeking Alpha. Other banks are down as well. Goldman Sachs is down about 4%, Citigroup is down about 2.4% and Wells Fargo is down about 1.2% on Wednesday. The S&P 500 is down only 0.25%.

JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said the decline stemmed from lower volatility compared with a year ago when the United Kingdom was preparing to vote on Brexit. Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said second-quarter earnings would be hurt by a drop in trading revenue, lower-than-expected interest rates and the sale or shuttering of certain assets. "There is a choppy sideways market due to the fact that fundamentals are largely unchanged and expectations of market friendly policies in the U.S. are being pushed to 2018," said Stephen Wood, chief market strategist, North America, Russell Investments. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the financial index's 1.3 percent fall leading the decliners. Financials, which have largely outperformed the broader market on bets of fiscal stimulus and simpler banking regulations under President Trump, are on track to decline 0.7 percent so far this year. JPMorgan was down 2 percent on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs fell 3 percent and was the biggest drag on the Dow. Bank of America was down 2.2 percent. At 10:40 a.m. EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 46.17 points, or 0.22 percent, at 20,983.3, the S&P 500 was down 5.15 points, or 0.21 percent, at 2,407.76 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 27.40 points, or 0.44 percent, at 6,175.79. The Federal Reserve issues its Beige Book at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), a compendium of anecdotes on the health of the economy, that will likely provide further evidence that the economy continues to strengthen giving the Federal Reserve impetus to raise rate next month. Traders currently see an 86.6-percent chance of a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed's June meeting, according to Thomson Reuters data. Shares of Michael Kors fell 9.4 percent to $32.88 after the luxury fashion retailer gave a bleak full-year forecast and said it would shut more than 100 full-price retail stores in the next two years. Mallinckrodt was down 1.1 percent at $43.12, after sources said the drugmaker is exploring a sale of its generic drug unit, in a deal that could fetch as much as $2 billion. Analog Devices rose 3.9 percent to $88.06 after the chipmaker's quarterly results came in above expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,816 to 928, for a 1.96-to-1 ratio on the downside. On the Nasdaq, 1,842 issues fell and 771 advanced for a 2.39-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The S&P 500 index showed 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows.

The major averages edged lower in Tuesday's stock market trading, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite snapping seven-day winning streaks. Several big-cap tech giants hit fresh all-time highs, but bank stocks were among the notable losers, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC). Citigroup (C) also edged lower, but remains in relatively sound shape. XAutoplay: On | OffDow industrials futures rose a fraction above fair value, S&P 500 futures also edged up while Nasdaq 100 futures rose more than 0.1%. U.S. crude oil futures fell nearly 2% to below $49 a barrel amid renewed oversupply concerns. Bank stocks were big leaders of the so-called Trump rally following the presidential election. But the stocks have struggled for several months. Here are four reasons to look beyond the banks to other sectors. Stock Charts Weak Dow industrials component JPMorgan Chase narrowly avoided undercutting the low of its base Tuesday, setting a four-month closing low. JPMorgan Chase, fellow Dow stock Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are all below their downwardly sloping 50-day moving averages, with Wells Fargo (WFC) under its 200-day for good measure. Relative strength lines, which track how stocks perform vs. the S&P 500, highlight how financials have lagged in 2017. JPMorgan's RS line has fallen to its lowest levels since Election Day, with other banks' RS lines showing similar weakness. Citigroup is an exception. Citi is just below a 62.63 buy point in a flat base, and is still in range from an aggressive entry at 60.89. Citi's RS line isn't great but has risen fractionally over the past four months. IBD'S TAKE: Every day the market is full of noise. So what should you focus on? IBD's Investing Action Plan highlights top earnings reports, stock near entries and key economic data for the coming day. In the latest action play, we highlight three stocks in buy range with earnings due Wednesday. Tax Cuts Sidelined A big reason why bank stocks, and the overall market, rallied on Trump's election was the prospect of tax cuts and other pro-growth measures. But Trump has been embroiled in troubles, distracting the White House and sapping his political capital. Republicans are divided on key issues, including how much to cut and how to offset the lost revenue, if at all. Wall Street appears to be pricing-out prospects for major tax reform, at least in 2017. Bank executives, and perhaps investors, are still hopeful that the Trump administration will ease financial regulatory burdens that limit lending and buybacks. Yield Curve Stronger economic growth should spur demand for loans, but it also should encourage higher interest rates and wider spreads between banks' short-term funding costs and long-term lending rates. Yield spreads widened after the election. But with the Federal Reserve raising short-term official rates and the 10-year Treasury yield sliding toward 2017 lows, the yield curve is the flattest in seven months. That's bad news for banks' net interest margins and not a great sign for the economy either. Long-Term Performance Bank stocks are going through a lull right now. Perhaps they'll turn around soon. But looking at long-term charts, bank stocks haven't really outperformed the S&P 500 for long stretches, even well-run operations such as JPMorgan. Bank stocks have had short-term outperformance, such as in last few months of 2016, but banks are not secular market leaders. If investors want to follow the market, buying a broad index mutual fund or ETF (with banks a significant part of the holdings) can do that without the sector risk. Overseas Trading Japan's Nikkei fell 0.1%. China's Shanghai composite, which had been closed on Tuesday, rose 0.2% after climbing much more earlier on a report indicating steady manufacturing growth. In Europe, the U.K.'s FTSE climbed 0.3% intraday, Germany's Dax 0.2% and France's CAC-40 edged higher.

But the company's ability to do high volume, value-added manufacturing at a reasonable cost may cushion it from any potential slowdown in demand for iPhones in the long term, a JPMorgan analyst told CNBC. It is expected to assemble the bulk of Apple's newest smartphones due later this year, and may benefit from a supercycle. "Hon Hai, at the end of the day, is a process company," said Gokul Hariharan, Asia tech analyst and head of Taiwan equity research at JPMorgan. "If you look at the history of Hon Hai over the last 20 years, product cycle has not really mattered as much." Sean Gallup | Getty Images He explained the company has always tried to run a vertically integrated business model, where it started with connectors and other components business before going into assembly in mid-to-late 90s. First Hon Hai assembled desktops when they were still the main tech product; then it moved into game consoles, feature phones with Motorola and Nokia, and music players for Apple before moving onto smartphones. "So all along, the skill set they're providing is high volume manufacturing at a very reasonable cost and very strong execution," Hariharan said, adding the manufacturer also brings in a fair bit of technology elements into its offering. "Which is why it feels like it may not be very directly linked to product cycles in the long term." Along the way, Hon Hai added some components businesses to their operations in an attempt to maximize the value, in terms of dollar content, within any product they assemble, according to Hariharan. Last year's acquisition of troubled Japanese electronics maker Sharp meant Hon Hai now had access to two major components of a smartphone: camera modules and display. These two functionalities are usually expected to be upgraded by smartphone vendors, even when other features of handsets may remain the same. "If you look at most tech products, display is typically one of the largest cost items in terms of components," Hariharan said. Japanese business daily Nikkei reported in January that Hon Hai and Sharp were mulling over building a factory in China — where the iPhones are assembled — to make OLED display panels. The proximity could theoretically reduce components cost for making the iPhone. The next generation of iPhones are expected to come with OLED display and currently Samsung Display will provide the bulk of these panels for Apple. show chapters Cramer: iPhone 8 cycle will be a big one    Monday, 22 May 2017 | 9:16 AM ET | 01:49 Reuters reported that Hon Hai and Sharp have teamed up to bid for Toshiba's prized memory chip business. Hariharan said a potential move into the semiconductor business was underpinned by the fact that Hon Hai made close to 20 to 25 percent in revenue from enterprise and cloud; the company assembles servers, storage elements and switches for tech companies and enterprise is a big driver for NAND flash, he added. The other two major contract electronics manufacturers that assemble iPhones — Pegatron and Wistron — also remain exposed to Apple, at least in the short term. Wistron is a latecomer to the assembly equation and handles mostly the older iPhones. Hariharan said JPMorgan has a conservative view on Wistron because the company is still making the transition from producing lower-end handsets to the most advanced; it needs to build up capacity to handle the high volume seen in the first quarter of new iPhone launches, where Apple can sell more than 10 million units on the opening weekend. "If you're not a vendor who is able to support that volume ramp in that period, then you never get peak volume for your capacity," he said. Meanwhile, some of Apple's more specialized suppliers — who provide components such as camera modules — remain well-hedged in their business because they serve the global smartphone market — meaning, they were also selling into other smartphone brands. For example Samsung or SK Hynix supply memory to majority of the smartphone brands. "They don't have the same level of cyclicality," said Hariharan, but they don't enjoy the same benefits from a surge in demand for iPhones. "They won't have the same upside when you have a very strong iPhone cycle, in terms of their revenues and profits." show chapters Apple, Samsung lose market share to Chinese phone makers    Tuesday, 23 May 2017 | 4:25 PM ET | 01:03 For the moment, Hariharan expects the dynamics between Apple and its suppliers to remain in the short term: this means iPhone assemblers like Hon Hai, Pegatron and Wistron will stay exposed to the iPhone product cycle and their revenues will swing accordingly. But in the longer term, if smartphones are replaced by something bigger, Hariharan said a company with a vertically integrated business model such as Hon Hai could be the partner of choice to assemble it. JPMorgan's price target for Hon Hai by year-end is NT$112 ($3.72). On Wednesday morning at 10:40 a.m. HK/SIN, Hon Hai shares traded at NT$104.

But his view that not all is well on the ASX is not. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link In April average cash holdings overtook consumer discretionary stocks as the largest active position held by fund managers across any ASX sector. Photo: AFR While none have so far followed his lead in publicly quitting the market, many in Australia's professional investment community appear to be quietly preparing for a downturn.  According to the JPMorgan Fund Manager Radar, which assesses the public disclosures of major fund managers to deduce common themes, average cash holdings surged to 370 basis points in April, overtaking consumer discretionary stocks as the largest active position held by fund managers across any ASX sector. This follows several months of increasing cash allocations. "We do see the appeal [of cash] in a market where opportunities look increasingly constrained due to extended valuations (healthcare, industrials), structural concerns (banks, resources, retail) and style/franking limitations (REITS)," wrote JPMorgan equity strategist Jason Steed, adding he believed cash allocations could rise further. Advertisement Mr Parker, a 30-year veteran of funds management, said he was cashing out and returning "hundreds of millions" in client money because he believed the overheated east-coast property market, a Chinese debt bubble and overvalued equity markets would combine to spell "calamity" for Australian equity investors. "We think that there is too much risk in this market at the moment, we think it's crazy," he said. "Giving up management and performance fees and handing back cash from investments managed by us is a seminal decision, however, preserving clients' assets is what all fund managers should always put before their own interests." Veteran fund manager Geoff Wilson, of Wilson's Asset Management, didn't quibble with Mr Parker's assessment that the market was heading for some kind of downturn.  On the ASX – which has suffered a bad month, with the S&P/ASX 200 down more than 4 per cent and the big four banks on track for the worst May in 44 years – Wilson said: "It's going to be a tough period. And that's with the backdrop of the biggest global market in the very mature stages of a bull market," he added, referring to Wall Street's record-breaking run. Bennelong Australian Equity Partners' investment director Julian Beaumont was more sanguine, saying while the increasing allocation to cash holdings shows concern is building among fund managers, the level of systemic risk is being overstated. "The risks aren't that bad," he said. "We've always had these risks. [Mr Parker] talks to getting out of equities from the point of view that property looks over-bought. But what's the real relevance of that? A company like Woolworths, or CSL, or Telstra, isn't reliant on the property market. You should still be able to find opportunities. "Since the GFC, the worse the economy has looked, the more quantitative easing was required, the more the market has gone up ... it's not always the case that stockmarket returns will correlate with the economic picture. "We do believe there are some real risks in a large part of the economy, and we're positioning to avoid them." Defensive stance But both fund managers, assessments of risk aside, believed a falling market was no reason to give up on making returns for their investors.  BAEP is favouring sectors that are growing defensively, such as healthcare or everyday consumer products, plus Australian companies whose products are doing well overseas.  As for May's underperformance, "it's the top end that's really suffered", Mr Beaumont said, with the ASX 20 by far the worst performer. "We're certainly not throwing our hands up. We're actually finding some good opportunities. In fact, valuations look quite attractive in certain parts of the market, especially outside the large caps." Mr Wilson, whose main large-cap equity fund is holding 30 per cent cash, believed even if things did worsen as drastically as Mr Parker expected, any downturn would provide an "exciting" opportunity to make some serious money. "People deciding to get their money back, well, that's their choice. But as a professional fund manager, everyone at Wilson spends all day trying to make money. That's the case in cheap markets and in expensive markets."  Mr Wilson added it was his belief that times when equities looked stretched were the best for fund managers to raise money. That's because a crash, when it comes, offers fantastic opportunities to buy companies trading at steep discounts. "Significant market adjustments – whether it's the 1987 crash, the bursting of the tech bubble in 2000 or the global financial crisis – they create phenomenal opportunities for astute investors. "Those three events were to me once-in-a-lifetime events where we could buy companies at, say, 50 per cent discounts to their cash backing." Anyway, he added, if you're going to sell out, knowing when to do so is a fraught business. "The thing is, you can never pick the top or the bottom of the market," he said, before wryly noting the market's tendency to confound expectations. "The fact that everyone's negative means it'll probably keep going up in the short term." Advertisement HuffPost Australia The Big Four Whingeing About The Bank ...

However, with innovative entrepreneurs making moves and an economy that is ready to reclaim its former glory, the Motor City is poised for an impressive resurgence. And if you need some convincing, JPMorgan Chase as 150 million reasons to believe in this Michigan gem. In tandem with Detroit Startup Week powered by Chase for Business, JPMorgan Chase has announced they will be increasing their initial investment in the economic recovery of Detroit to $150 million by 2019. This announcement comes after the original $100 million, five-year investment turned out to be two years ahead of schedule. Pretty impressive for a place once known as the largest US city to ever declare of bankruptcy. “Detroit’s resurgence is a model for what can be accomplished when leaders work together to create economic growth and opportunity,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase, in a press release. “This collaboration allowed us to speed up our investment and extend our commitment over the next two years. Going forward, I hope business, government and nonprofit leaders will see Detroit’s comeback as a shining example of how to put aside differences and work to find meaningful and innovative solutions to our most pressing economic problems.” The goal of this investment is to build upon the city’s progress, create livable, inclusive, and sustainable neighborhoods, arm residents with the skills needed for high-quality, well-paying careers, and provide small businesses with the capital they need to succeed. JPMorgan Chase has invested $107 million in loans and grants in Detroit’s economic recovery, including $50 million in community development financing, $25.8 million to revitalize neighborhoods, $15 million for workforce development, $9.5 million for small business expansion, and $6.9 million in additional transformative investments. “JPMorgan Chase has been a true partner in our work to restore economic growth and opportunity in Detroit,” said Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan. “The firm’s investments have enabled thousands of Detroiters to receive training, created new opportunities for entrepreneurs and revitalized neighborhoods. There is more work to do, and I hope our continued partnership will build a thriving economy for all Detroiters.” Economic challenges are no stranger to Detroit. But this investment, along with the entrepreneurial spirit of the Motor City, is another step in the right direction. It will utilize everything in Chase’s arsenal to strengthen underlying organizations and create system-wide changes that will improve citywide workforce development strategy. Before you know it, this Michigan city will be the thriving economy we all know and love.

(NYSE: CIT) today announced the final results of its „modified Dutch auction” tender offer, which expired at 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on May 24, 2017. Based on the final count by Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the depositary for the tender offer, CIT accepted for payment 57,291,666 shares of CIT’s common stock at a purchase price of $48.00 per share, for a cost of approximately $2,750,000,000, excluding fees and expenses related to the tender offer.  The repurchased shares represent approximately 28.3% of CIT’s common shares issued and outstanding as of May 23, 2017. Because the aggregate purchase price for all shares properly tendered at or below the purchase price and not properly withdrawn before the expiration date would have exceeded $2,750,000,000, such shares were accepted for purchase on a pro rata basis, except for „odd lots,” which were accepted in full.  CIT has been informed by the depositary that the proration factor for the tender offer, after giving effect to the priority for „odd lots,” is approximately 88.6%.  The depositary will promptly pay for all shares accepted for payment and will return all other shares tendered. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC acted as the Lead Dealer Manager and Barclays Capital Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. acted as the Co-Dealer Managers for the offer. Georgeson LLC acted as the information agent and Computershare Trust Company, N.A. acted as the depositary for the offer. Evercore acted as advisor to CIT’s Board of Directors on the transaction. Any questions regarding the tender offer may be directed to J.P. Morgan Securities LLC at (877) 371-5947 (toll-free) or (212) 622-4401 (direct) or to Georgeson LLC at (877) 278-4774.

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Site Archive Stocks slide as banks, energy companies sink Wednesday May 31, 2017 at 11:12 AM May 31, 2017 at 4:34 PM The Associated Press NEW YORK — U.S. stocks are slipping for the second day in a row Wednesday, led by a slump in banks as investors worry how their trading businesses are doing this quarter. Energy companies are falling with the price of oil. Big technology companies and small-company stocks are also down. Those declines are canceling out gains for drug companies and household products makers. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 4 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,408 as of 2:45 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 34 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,995. The Nasdaq composite fell 19 points, or 0.3 percent, to 6,184. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks again did worse than the other major indexes. It retreated 5 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,365. The S&P 500 is on track to finish May with a 1 percent gain. After a three-month losing streak last summer it has risen six out of the last seven months. BANKS: Banks fell as investors worried that their revenue from trading stocks, bonds and currencies is going to weaken in the second quarter. Executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America both spoke about that issue at industry events on Wednesday. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said trading revenue will fall 10 percent compared to a year ago. The banking industry had an outstanding first quarter, and trading was a key reason for that. JPMorgan Chase fell $1.87, or 2.2 percent, to $82.03 and Capital One slumped $1.63, or 2.1 percent, to $76.65. Goldman Sachs, which had an unusually bad quarter as its trading business struggled, gave up $7.28, or 3.3 percent, to $211.14. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.20 percent from 2.21 percent. That also hurt banks, as lower bond yields force interest rates lower on loans, reducing banks' profits from lending. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.34, or 2.7 percent, to $48.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, fell $1.53, or 3 percent, to $50.31 a barrel in London. Energy stocks continued to decline. Chevron sank 61 cents to $103.45 and Hess declined $1.04, or 2.2 percent, to $45.63. FEELING BETTER: Pfizer rose 58 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $32.71 and Irish drugmaker Perrigo climbed $3.71, or 5.5 percent, to $71.63 after its first-quarter report was better than expected. Health care products maker Johnson & Johnson advanced $1.45, or 1.1 percent, to $128.56. Household products companies also rose. Clorox gained $1.31, or 1 percent, to $136.24 and Kimberly-Clark, which makes Huggies diapers and Kleenex tissue, picked up $1.98, or 1.5 percent, to $130.95. Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, advanced 77 cents to $88.17. KORS GETS CORED: Michael Kors Holdings hit a five-year low after it said it will close up to 125 stores as its sales have remained weak. The luxury retailer said sales at older stores dropped in its latest quarter and investors were disappointed with its projections for the current quarter. The stock tumbled $3.51, or 9.7 percent, to $32.76. CLOUDY DAY FOR SOLAR: Solar power companies took losses as investors expected President Donald Trump to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement. Officials from the European Union said the EU and China will maintain their commitments to the pact. Shares of First Solar, the largest U.S. solar company, declined 92 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $38.58. SunPower fell 23 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $7.92 while solar wafer maker Canadian Solar retreated 73 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $12.81. HITTING RESET: Technology companies turned lower. The tech sector has reached its highest levels since the dot-com boom and companies like Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook have done far better than the rest of the market in 2017. Apple and Facebook are up 32 percent this year, and Alphabet is up 24 percent. All three slid Wednesday. CURRENCIES: The dollar slipped to 110.68 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro rose to $1.1239 from $1.1188. The British pound rose to $1.2882 from $1.2813. The currency was volatile after polls and surveys showed the general election on June 8 might be closer than expected. Early on, observers expected the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Theresa May to win in a landslide. May supports Britain's exit from the European Union, and if she wins a smaller majority, it could hurt her side as Britain negotiates its departure from the union. OTHER ENERGY TRADING: Wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Heating oil gave up 3 cents to $1.52 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 7 cents to $3.07 per 1,000 cubic feet. METALS: Gold rose $9.70 to $1,265.40 an ounce. Silver fell 2 cents to $17.41 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.58 a pound. OVERSEAS: European stocks gave up an early gain. The DAX in Germany remained up 0.1 percent, but France's CAC 40 lost 0.4 percent and the British FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index dipped 0.1 percent and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.2 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong inched down 0.1 percent.

Wednesday’s weakness was based on a familiar theme: doubts that prolonged cuts by OPEC and its allies will succeed in clearing a surplus while U.S. output remains so resilient. Even though Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said the cuts are working and predicted global inventories will fall to the five-year average in early 2018, American drillers continue to add rigs to shale fields, according to Bloomberg News’ Meenal Vamburkar. “There doesn’t seem to be an end to supply out there,” said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA. “And demand is not exactly rip-roaring.” American drillers last week boosted the number of active rigs to 722, the most since April 2015, according to data from Baker Hughes.  To the strategists at JPMorgan, the gyrations in the price have wide implications. The broad range of $40 to $60 a barrel that the market is stuck in is depressed enough in terms of average prices and wide enough “to complicate” a number of key trades that investors have piled into that are dependent on faster inflation. Those include shorting bonds, owning debt securities that protect against rising consumer prices, and betting on the currencies of some commodity-dependent economies over the next year. Energy stocks are the worst-performing sector in the MSCI All-Country World Index this year, falling 8.39 percent on average. HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN Despite a seventh straight month of gains for the global stock market, May ended with a bit of a whimper. Equities fell as financial stocks faltered on news from JPMorgan and Bank of America, the two biggest U.S. banks, that second-quarter trading revenue is on pace to drop at least 10 percent because tranquil markets are curbing demand, according to Bloomberg News’ Hugh Son and Dakin Campbell. Even before the latest revelations, financial shares were under pressure as a rally in longer-term bonds caused the difference between short- and long-term borrowing cost to shrink, raising concern about the health of banks’ net interest margins. One proxy of financial shares, the PowerShares KBW Bank Portfolio exchange-traded fund, dropped 2.80 in May, bringing its loss since the end of February to 7.40 percent. Financial shares had soared in the prior four months, leading markets higher on the prospect that the Trump administration would loosen restrictive bank regulations. The PowerShares KBW Bank Portfolio ETF soared 29 percent between the end of October and the end of February. PIMCO IS DOING LOTS OF HAND-WRINGING In fact, most of the Trump administration’s pro-growth policies are in doubt, from tax reform to infrastructure spending -- at least for this year. Pacific Investment Management Co. was out with a report Wednesday saying that investors have become too complacent and that monetary, fiscal, trade and geopolitical risks abound. As they see it, there’s a 70 percent chance of a recession in the next five years, according to Bloomberg News’ John Gittelsohn. “We believe that many market participants today are too relaxed, that medium-term risks are building and that investors should consider using cyclical rallies to build cash to deploy when markets eventually correct -- and possibly overshoot -- as risks are repriced,” the firm said in its annual “Secular Outlook” for the next three to five years. Of concern to Pimco is that policy makers are “driving without a spare tire” because of limited tools -- caused by big balance sheets and low or negative interest rates -- to deal with a recession. GOLD BUGS ABOUND Given the worrying over at Pimco, perhaps it’s not surprising that hedge funds are jumping back into gold at the fastest pace since 2007. Money managers boosted their long positions in U.S. futures by the most in almost a decade in the week ended May 23, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Bullion futures have posted three straight weekly gains, helped by U.S. and European political angst that has boosted demand for the metal as a haven, according to Bloomberg News’ Joe Richter. Those bets have paid off with gold advancing Wednesday to its highest since April 25, or $1,276.80 per ounce. According to strategists at BMO Capital Markets, the Federal Reserve’s monthly Beige Book economic report struck a dovish tone on the economy, offered a divergence from the “all is well" mantra as optimism waned in some districts, namely Boston, Chicago and New York. Is it too late to buy some gold? CHINA TAKES ON CURRENCY SPECULATORS Foreign-exchange traders and strategists alike are (re)learning a tough lesson: Don’t bet against the yuan. The currency has jumped to its highest level in seven months offshore, soaring as much as 1.1 percent on Wednesday alone, despite analyst forecasts for declines this quarter. Surging interbank rates are squeezing bears by driving up the cost of short positions, according to Bloomberg News’ Helen Sun, Molly Wei and Emma Dai. The rally, which broke months of calm against the dollar, came on the heels of an unwelcome credit-rating downgrade from Moody’s. China made its displeasure clear, calling the move “absolutely groundless.” The central bank had already been battling pessimistic traders by repeatedly strengthening the daily fixing. “The Moody’s downgrade and a weaker spot rate compared to the fixing could have spurred the authorities to change the fixing mechanism and potentially intervene in the market,” said Jason Daw, Singapore-based head of emerging-market currency strategy at Societe Generale. EMERGING-MARKET STOCKS FACE NEW ERA The stock markets of the world’s developing economies are about to undergo a bit of a revolution. As the index provider MSCI prepares to carry out its annual review in June, some of the world’s biggest markets -- with assets totaling almost $9 trillion -- are poised for reclassification, according to Bloomberg News’ Srinivasan Sivabalan. Perhaps the most notable are China and Saudi Arabia. China’s domestic equities were denied entry into MSCI’s benchmark indexes for a third year last June despite measures to address such concerns as repatriation limits and excessive trading suspensions. Only 169 mainland-listed companies will be considered for inclusion, down from 448 under a previous proposal, and all will be large-cap shares currently accessible to foreign investors through exchange links with Hong Kong. Two years after Saudi Arabia opened its stock market to global investors, foreign ownership has languished at about 5 percent and the equity index has lost about 30 percent. The market’s size fell by about $140 billion as the changes coincided with the government’s austerity measures. The country says its bourse has met all the criteria laid out by MSCI for inclusion. TEA LEAVES After Wednesday’s rather downbeat Beige Book, the monthly manufacturing report from the Institute for Supply Management will surely get extra attention. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News is for a reading of 54.6 for May, little changed from 54.8 in April. Recall that the weaker-than-expected result in April left the index essentially back at December’s levels that, according to the economists at Bloomberg Intelligence, may have been due to less optimism among manufacturers in the Trump administration’s capacity to deliver on a pro-manufacturing policy agenda. The BI economists say they will be paying attention to export orders, with any signs of resilience signaling a firming in external demand, which could provide a modest tailwind to growth.

Bank shares slid after the revenue updates and led the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Markets revenue at JPMorgan was down about 15 per cent in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a slump in fixed income, chief financial officer Marianne Lake said. Photo: Bloomberg Markets revenue at JPMorgan was down about 15 per cent in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a slump in fixed income, chief financial officer Marianne Lake said overnight at an investor conference in New York. At Bank of America, revenue from the business will be 10 per cent to 12 per cent lower, though first-half results should be stronger, chief executive officer Brian Moynihan said at a separate event. And a top Goldman Sachs executive agreed that clients' trading remains "subdued". Analysts at JPMorgan warned this month that revenue at the world's biggest investment banks was likely to drop in the second quarter because of the decline in fixed income. The UK's exit from the European Union and Donald Trump's surprise election win had been fuelling wagers on corporate bonds and the direction of interest rates over the past year, boosting Wall Street trading results. Those types of stimulants have been more scarce in recent months. Advertisement "There haven't been that many idiosyncratic events, and we need a few more of them," Ms Lake said. "As a sweeping generalisation, low rates, a more cautious outlook on rates, and low volatility have led to low client flows and a generally quiet, subdued and challenging trading environment." 'Cash but no conviction' In rates trading, clients are cautious because of conflicting signs from unemployment and inflation data, she said. In corporate bonds, "people have cash but no conviction" as spreads are tight. Equities, corporate derivatives and the prime brokerage were sources of strength in the quarter. "Client activities, which were more subdued in the first quarter, have in these first two months continued in a comparable fashion in the second quarter," David Solomon, Goldman Sachs's co-president, said at the same conference, declining to project the impact on the firm's revenue. At JPMorgan, the last three quarters of 2016 generated record trading revenue, so the comparisons this year are harder for traders to live up to, Lake said. "If I look to June, I don't see any particular reason for that to change," Ms Lake said. "But anything can happen in a month." Cost controls When it comes to mergers and acquisitions, uncertainties over European elections and US tax reform have led corporate executives to be cautious, Mr Solomon said. That's despite steady growth and a competitive environment that encourages CEOs to act. As a result, he expects a "reasonable pace" for deals, and said the environment has felt a little better in the past month or two than it did earlier in the year. Separately, analysts also asked about expense discipline. Goldman Sachs chief financial officer Marty Chavez, speaking at the same event as Mr Solomon, told investors that when the firm's revenue does climb, compensation will rise at a slower rate. Bank of America will take a charge of about $US300 million ($400,000) to speed up data-centre consolidation, and will report $US125 million in severance, about double what's typical, Mr Moynihan said. The expenses are part of the firm's goal of cutting total annual costs to $US53 billion by the end of 2018. "We're trying to accelerate opportunities, and so this quarter we'll do a couple things to push some stuff through and really position us to make that $US53 billion without a problem," he said.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman JPMorgan China Region Fund, Inc. Liquidation Progress BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Following the announcement on May 15, 2017, the assets of JPMorgan China Region Fund, Inc. (‘JFC’ or the ‘Fund’) now comprise 99.4% cash having undertaken the liquidation of the majority of the investment portfolio and the repayment of any outstanding loans, all pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution described in and attached to the proxy statement. Of the cash holding, the breakdown as at May 30, 2017 was as follows:             Amount USD Equivalent   CNY 205,182,913 29,905,686 EUR 3,996 4,467 GBP 2,888 3,714 HKD 3,185,270 408,716 USD 98,944,698 98,944,698 Total 129,267,281   Any material changes to the JFC’s cash position will be announced as soon as practicable. As described in the proxy statement, JFC assets held through the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (‘QFII’) program may only be repatriated once approved by Chinese regulators, the timing of which is not known. These assets will be held in Renminbi until such time that approval is granted. As a result, stockholders will not receive the net asset value, less liquidation costs, for these assets in the liquidating distribution, and instead will receive an interest in a liquidating trust that is anticipated to make additional distributions to stockholders upon repatriation of amounts under the QFII program. It is our intention that proceeds paid in the liquidating distribution by the Fund will be treated as liquidation proceeds for non-US holders. This release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of Fund securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws of such state or jurisdiction. The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company whose shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The Fund trades under the symbol “JFC.” The Fund seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation through investments primarily in equity securities of companies with substantial assets in, or revenues derived from, the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau–collectively, the China Region. JPMorgan Fund Services, in Boston, MA is the Fund’s accounting and administrative agent.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad U.S. bank shares decline on trading revenue concerns By Reuters Published: 15:49 EDT, 31 May 2017 | Updated: 15:49 EDT, 31 May 2017 e-mail By Sinead Carew May 31 (Reuters) - Shares in U.S. banks fell on Wednesday, with the S&amp;P 500 bank index hitting its lowest level since late 2016, after JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America Corp warned of revenue weakness in the current quarter. The bank index fell as much as 2.34 percent. Bank of America and JPMorgan each fell more than 2 percent and were the biggest drags on the S&amp;P 500. Goldman Sachs , which is in the S&amp;P financial sector index, fell 3.7 percent after it gave a trading update. JPMorgan's trading revenue has fallen 15 percent so far in the second quarter, its chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, told investors at a conference. She would not provide a prediction for June. Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan, meanwhile, told investors the bank's second-quarter trading revenue would be lower than a year ago. "It's especially difficult because of the year-over-year comparison. The first and second quarter in 2016 were fairly busy on the trading front," said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods in New York. Investors were disappointed that JPMorgan's CFO did not predict a turnaround for June, Grant said. "People are digging in for a bit of a slower summer here," he said. "If the big banks don't see anything on the horizon, then it potentially does not bode well for others. Volatility is non-existent. It's difficult to generate trading volumes or commissions or when the VIX is at historically low levels." The U.S. stock market's main gauge of investor anxiety closed at its lowest level in over two decades on May 8. The CBOE Volatility Index was up 4.8 percent at 10.88 on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs President David Solomon declined to give specifics about the bank´s trading business at an investor conference, but said subdued volatility - which depressed client activity in the first quarter - continued into April and May. JPMorgan shares were last down 2.5 percent at $81.84 after hitting their lowest level since Dec. 2, with trading volume 1.3 times the 10-day moving average. Bank of America shares were down 2.9 percent at $22.17 after earlier hitting a low of $22.09, also in heavy trading. Citigroup Corp was down 2 percent at $60.38 while Huntington Bancshares Inc was the second biggest percentage loser in the bank subsector with a 2.6 percent drop. Goldman Sachs shares hit their lowest point since late November and were last down 3.7 at $210.43 after hitting a low of $209.62. Trading volume in the stock was 1.8 times its 10-day moving average.

JPMorgan Just Broke the Financial Sector. JPMorgan Chase's revelation that trading volume is down from a year ago has caused bank stocks to drop today. By Ben Levisohn May 31, 2017 11:58 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large As JPMorgan Chase (JPM) goes, so goes the financial sector. Illustration: Agence France-Presse/Getty Images What do I mean? JPMorgan is so big, and operates across so many businesses, that it is often considered a bellwether for other banks stocks. That's true on the upside--remember when JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon made a big purchase of his company stock back in February 2016, signaling the market low?--but also true on the downside. And the revelation that JPMorgan's trading revenue is down 15% from a year ago, made at an industry conference today, has done just that--caused financial stocks to tumble. The Wall Street Journal's Emily Glazer reports: J.P. Morgan Chase JPM -2.06% & Co. finance chief Marianne Lake said the bank’s trading so far is down about 15% year-over-year though she won’t forecast for the coming quarter. Ms. Lake, speaking at an industry investor presentation Wednesday, said that is a “normal seasonal decline” for the markets business from the first quarter to the second quarter. That comment caused bank stocks that rely on trading for big chunk of their business--Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), and Morgan Stanley (MS), among them--to tumble. How bad are the drops? JPMorgan Chase has fallen 2% to $82.21 at 11:38 a.m. today, while Bank of America has dropped 2.5% to $22.26, Citigroup has slumped 2.5% to $60.11, and Morgan Stanley is off 2.2% at $41.33. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) has fallen 1.2% to $23.18, making financials the worst market sector today. And then there's Goldman Sachs. Its shares have tumbled 3.3% to $211.20, and its stock has broken its 200-day moving average: Illustration: FactSet That can't be good.

Chipmaker Analog Devices is up after its quarterly results were better than Wall Street had expected. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) BEIJING (AP) — Chinese stocks declined Thursday after a survey showed manufacturing weakening while other Asian markets gained after Wall Street fell for a second day. KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 percent to 3,102.21 while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 1 percent to 19,854.27. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 0.4 percent to 25,752.44 and Seoul's Kospi shed 0.1 percent to 2,344.29. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.2 percent to 5,733.90 and benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Southeast Asia also advanced. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks fell on a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for tech companies. That offset gains for drug makers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell after executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drug makers and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost less than 0.1 percent to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.1 percent to 21,008.65. CHINESE MANUFACTURING: The Chinese business magazine Caixin said its purchasing managers' index declined for a third month, falling to 49.6 from April's 50.3 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity contracting. That came after a separate PMI on Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics and an industry group, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, improved to 54.5 from 54. "Yesterday's official PMI reading had hinted at growth having remained broadly stable last month," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. "But today's downbeat unofficial PMI suggests conditions may not have held up as well as previously thought." Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

TRUMP AND CLIMATE: President Donald Trump was preparing to announce a decision on whether to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Trump promoted his announcement Wednesday night on Twitter, after a day in which U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of a U.S. withdrawal. Trump himself kept everyone in suspense, saying he was still listening to "a lot of people both ways." Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement to fight global warming by reducing carbon emissions. Withdrawing would leave the United States aligned only with Russia among the world's industrialized economies. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. oil gained 38 cents to $48.70 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.34 on Wednesday to close at $48.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 40 cents to $51.16 in London. It dropped $1.48 the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 110.92 yen from Wednesday's 110.76.

(AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) BEIJING — Global stock markets were mostly higher Thursday following Wall Street's decline while Chinese stocks fell after a survey showed manufacturing activity weakening. KEEPING SCORE: France's CAC-40 gained 0.5 per cent to 5,308.60 and Germany's DAX advanced 0.4 per cent to 12,660.42. London's FTSE 100 retreated 0.3 per cent to 7,543.86. On Wednesday, the DAX gained 0.1 per cent while the FTSE 100 shed 0.1 per cent and the CAC-40 lost 0.4 per cent. On Wall Street, futures for the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500 index were up just under 0.1 per cent. ASIA'S DAY: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 per cent to 3,102.62 while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 advanced 1.1 per cent to 19,860.03. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.5 per cent to 25,779.34 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 added 0.2 per cent to 5,738.10. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.1 per cent to 2,344.61 and India's Sensex was unchanged at 31,155.89. Benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Singapore rose while Bangkok retreated. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks fell on a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for tech companies. That offset gains for drug makers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell after executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drug makers and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The S&P 500 lost less than 0.1 per cent to 2,411.80. The Dow dropped 0.1 per cent to 21,008.65. CHINESE MANUFACTURING: The Chinese business magazine Caixin said its purchasing managers' index declined for a third month, falling to 49.6 from April's 50.3 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity contracting. That came after a separate PMI on Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics and an industry group, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, improved to 54.5 from 54. ANALYST'S TAKE: "Today's PMI reading points to growth having slowed more rapidly last month than the official PMI initially suggested," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. Reasons for the conflicting readings were unclear, but one possibility is that Caixin's survey includes more small or private companies than the official measure. "The latest data are still consistent with our broader outlook on the Chinese economy," said Evans-Pritchard. "We have long been warning that the rebound in growth during the second half of last year would prove short-lived." TRUMP AND CLIMATE: President Donald Trump was preparing to announce whether he will pull the United States out of the 195-nation Paris agreement to combat global warming by reducing carbon emissions. U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of an American withdrawal. On Twitter, Trump said he still was listening to "a lot of people both ways." Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement. KOREA TRADE: May exports rose 13.4 per cent over a year earlier but growth decelerated from April. Exports are forecast to maintain relatively robust growth this year, possibly helped by the release of a new Samsung smartphone model. But they also face potential risks from rising pressure in the United States and Europe for restrictions on imports, as well as possible slowing Chinese growth. INDIAN MANUFACTURING: A survey showed Indian manufacturing activity grew in May but more slowly than April. A purchasing managers' index declined to 51.6 from April's six-month high of 52.5 on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 show activity expanding. The measures for output and new orders declined but stayed well above 50. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. oil gained 48 cents to $48.80 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.34 on Wednesday to close at $48.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 45 cents to $51.21 in London. It dropped $1.48 the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 110.95 yen from Wednesday's 110.76. The euro edged down to $1.1246 from $1.1247.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *       A man talks on his mobile phone in front of an electronic stock board showing Japan's Nikkei 225 index at a securities firm Thursday, June 1, 2017, in Tokyo.

Wall Street is gripping for a double-digit drop in second-quarter trading revenue as one of its biggest businesses, bond trading, suffers from tranquil markets and the Federal Reserve’s easy-money policies. JPMorgan Chase, the biggest bank in the US, is bracing for a 15-percent slide in bond trading — in part because optimism on Wall Street about President Trump’s tax-cutting agenda has kept markets so stable. “There’s not a lot to trade around right now,” Maryanne Lake, the Chief Financial Officer at JPMorgan Chase, said at an industry conference on Wednesday as she revealed the glum forecast. JPMorgan isn’t the only bank preparing for a dip. Bank of America will likely see a 10- to 12-percent dip in trading revenues, hurt in part by lower interest rates, Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, said at the conference. The news sent bank stocks down for the day. JPMorgan was off 2 percent by early afternoon, to $82.24. BofA shares fell 2.5 percent, to $22.25. Shares of Goldman Sachs, which suffered a disastrous quarter in the beginning of the year because of its weak bond trading, fell 3 percent, to $211.84. Market shocks are good for the trading business, since that gives traders a reason to buy bonds off spooked investors, then turn around and sell them to bullish ones. But with corporate profits rising, a strong labor market, and economic confidence near all-time highs, the bond market has been dry as dust. “There haven’t been that many idiosyncratic events, and we need a few more of them,” Lake added. Last year, banks saw a boost in trading late in the quarter thanks to the surprise results from the UK vote to leave the European Union. Last year, Lake said that there had been a “spike” in trading thanks to the “Brexit.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under bank of america ,  goldman sachs ,  jpmorgan chase ,  trading ,  wall street Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next City to cut ties with Wells Fargo after fake-account scand...

Bloomberg News reports that fixed-income trading is down for the first two months of the period and equities are up “slightly,” Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said Wednesday at an investor conference in New York. Lake said she doesn’t see any particular reason those trends would change in June. Revenue from the world’s biggest investment banks is likely to drop in the second quarter, ending a rebound in fixed income, analysts at New York-based JPMorgan said this month. The U.K.’s exit from the European Union and Donald Trump’s surprise election win fueled more wagers on corporate bonds and the direction of interest rates over the past year, boosting Wall Street trading revenue.

But with the major scandal unfolding at Wells Fargo, angry former employees illuminate the alarming pressure that allegedly led local bankers to defraud perhaps more than a million customers. by Bethany McLeanSummer 2017 Email Facebook Twitter BREAKING THE BANK Former Wells Fargo executives, from top: Carrie Tolstedt, head of Community Banking; C.E.O. Dick Kovacevich; and his successor, John Stumpf. Photo Illustration by Cristiana Couceiro. Once upon a time, in 1970, long before America’s banking system was dominated by six giant institutions—JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley—Dennis Hambek started working as a messenger at the National Bank of Washington in Ellensburg, Washington. Over the years, as his career advanced from messenger to loan officer to branch manager, he had a front-row seat at the transformation of America’s banking system. That first year, the National Bank of Washington was swallowed up by Pacific National Bank of Seattle, which in 1981 was bought by Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp, which in 1996 was bought by San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, which in 1999—as the consolidation frenzy was reaching its peak—merged with Norwest, a Minneapolis-based bank, in a $34 billion deal. Wells Fargo, which was founded in 1852 as a stagecoach express to carry valuable goods to and from the gold mines in the West, had a storied brand, so the new, combined company kept that name. But if Norwest’s name didn’t survive, its corporate culture did. Spearheaded by the company’s then C.E.O., Dick Kovacevich, it involved a novel way of thinking about banking. As Kovacevich told me in a 1998 profile of him I wrote for Fortune magazine, the key question facing banks was “How do you sell money?” His answer was that financial instruments—A.T.M. cards, checking accounts, credit cards, loans—were consumer products, no different from, say, screwdrivers sold by Home Depot. In Kovacevich’s lingo, bank branches were “stores,” and bankers were “salespeople” whose job was to “cross-sell,” which meant getting “customers”—not “clients,” but “customers”—to buy as many products as possible. “It was his business model,” says a former Norwest executive. “It was a religion. It very much was the culture.” It was underpinned by the financial reality that customers who had, say, lines of credit and savings accounts with the bank were far more profitable than those who just had checking accounts. In 1997, prior to Norwest’s merger with Wells Fargo, Kovacevich launched an initiative called “Going for Gr-Eight,” which meant getting the customer to buy eight products from the bank. The reason for eight? “It rhymes with GREAT!” he said. This slogan, however, as experienced by bankers on the ground such as Hambek, was more hard-core than hokey. “We had a lot of longtime customers and a good staff, but the sales pressure kept mounting, mounting, mounting,” Hambek says. “Every morning, we had a conference call with all the managers. You were supposed to tell them how you were going to make your sales goal for the day, and if you didn’t, you’d have to call in the afternoon to explain why you didn’t make it and how you were going to fix it. It was really tense.” Achieving sales goals wasn’t easy. Ellensburg is a small town, and there were seven other banks. VIDEO: Preet Bharara on Policing Wall Street, the Mob, and More That’s when Hambek began to see things that shouldn’t have been happening: bankers persuading customers to take out large loans and then immediately repay part of them so that the banker could get credit for the bigger loan, for instance. In the summer of 2005, a customer named Bill Moore complained to Hambek about a checking account and a savings account—that he had been given but hadn’t asked for and didn’t want. Hambek investigated and discovered that the banker who opened them had entered Moore’s driver’s-license number as “MOOREWF00000” and the date of issuance as January 1, 2000, a holiday when the Washington State Department of Licensing would have been closed, as shown by documents first obtained by Vice News. “Gaming,” which was defined in the Wells Fargo Code of Ethics as “the manipulation and/or misrepresentation of sales or referrals . . . in an attempt to receive compensation or to meet sales goals,” was supposed to be a big no-no, so Hambek called the Wells Fargo EthicsLine, and he told his supervisor what he’d found. “I said, ‘This is blatant gaming,’ ” he recalls, but nobody seemed to care. Later that summer, after 35 years of service, he retired in order to avoid being fired for lack of productivity. INSIDE WELLS, THE ATTITUDE WAS “DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO, BUT DON’T GET CAUGHT.” Twitter On December 27, 2005, Hambek sent a letter via certified mail to Carrie Tolstedt, who had become the head of regional banking at Wells Fargo in 2002. In the letter, which would have been passed on to the bank’s legal department, he described the gaming he’d witnessed, and told her that employees were leaving. “It would behoove someone to survey these employees as to the true reason they left the company.” He added, “Upper management is also aware of this, as is the ethics line, yet no action has been taken.” Hambek never got a response to his letter. (Wells Fargo had no comment on this matter.) In the ensuing decade, the big banks got even bigger. Wells Fargo swallowed up Wachovia during the financial crisis, to become the country’s third-largest bank by assets, and its soaring stock made it worth almost $300 billion. John Stumpf, a native Minnesotan who could have played a modern George Bailey, took over as C.E.O. when Kovacevich retired, at the end of 2007. He, like Kovacevich, repeatedly cited Wells Fargo’s success at cross-selling as a reason investors should value the bank’s stock—and they believed. “In the eyes of Wall Street, Wells has always been a cut above,” says one longtime bank investor. Unlike the other big banks, it positioned itself as “the bank of the real economy,” i.e., its major business was retail banking for everyday folks, not trading or investment banking for sophisticated investors. It helped that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has long been the bank’s biggest shareholder. Don’t Bank on It But the pretty picture masked a dark reality. On September 8, 2016, Wells Fargo agreed to pay a combined $185 million penalty to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (C.F.P.B.), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the City and County of Los Angeles to settle charges from all three that, as the C.F.P.B. put it, there had been “fraudulent conduct . . . on a massive scale.” (As part of the agreement Wells Fargo admitted no wrongdoing.) Wells Fargo’s own analysis found that between 2011 and 2015 its employees had opened more than 1.5 million deposit accounts and more than 565,000 credit-card accounts that may not have been authorized. Some customers were charged fees on accounts they didn’t know they had, and some customers had collection agencies calling them due to unpaid fees on accounts they didn’t know existed. Gaming was so widespread that it had even spawned related terms, such as “pinning,” which meant assigning customers personal-identification numbers, or PINs, without their knowledge in order to impersonate them on Wells Fargo computers and enroll them in various products without their knowledge. The fraud was not only big, but blatant, with 193,000 non-employee accounts opened between 2011 and 2015 for which the only e-mail domain name listed was @wellsfargo.com, according to the Los Angeles city attorney’s office. In light of all this, the $185 million fine was a pittance—less than Tolstedt and Stumpf had made in the previous five years and a mere 3 percent of second-quarter profits. And Wells, which also announced that it had fired some 1,000 mainly junior employees for gaming, clearly thought it had disposed of a nuisance issue. But that was hardly the end of it. Suddenly Wells Fargo employees, such as Hambek, came forward in droves, and America got mad in a way that we hadn’t over other financial scandals. “I think the public expects international financial banks to lose billions in nefarious ways,” says Isaac Boltansky, the director of policy research at Compass Point, a prominent boutique investment bank. “But learning that the American checking account has been co-opted has insidious wrinkles. This is supposed to be one of the most trusted things in the world.” At congressional hearings in which John Stumpf’s appealing midwestern diffidence suddenly seemed like appalling arrogance, representatives from both sides of the aisle let loose. “Fraud is fraud. Theft is theft,” thundered Texas Republican congressman Jeb Hensarling, “and what happened at Wells Fargo over the course of many years cannot be described any other way.” “You haven’t returned a single nickel of your personal earnings,” Hensarling’s ideological opposite number, Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, told Stumpf. “You haven’t fired a single senior executive. Instead evidently your definition of accountable is to push the blame to your low-level employees.” Now Wells Fargo is facing a plethora of ongoing investigations by various authorities, including criminal probes by the Justice Department and the California attorney general. The latter has requested not just the identity of the Wells Fargo employees who might have “used the unlawfully obtained [PINs] to commit false impersonation and identity theft,” according to a search warrant first made public by the Los Angeles Times, but also “the managers of the identified employees . . . [including] branch managers, area managers, and regional managers.” “People want to trust their banks, and Wells has brought mistrust to the table,” says one longtime investor. So how is it that Dick Kovacevich’s beautiful strategy went so horribly wrong? VIDEO: Bernie Madoff’s Victims Speak Out Almost 15 years before the scandal became front-page news, in 2002, Wells Fargo’s internal investigations unit had noticed an uptick in what they called “sales integrity” cases. “Whether real or perceived, team members . . . feel they cannot make sales goals without gaming the system,” an investigator wrote in a report dated August 2004. “The incentive to cheat is based on the fear of losing their jobs.” The report recommended that Wells consider reducing or eliminating sales goals, as several peer banks had done, and warned that the issue could lead to “loss of business and . . . diminished reputation in the community.” There was no follow-up. The list of employees who complained is long and reaches back well over a decade. In March of 2008, just around the time the financial crisis was getting into full swing, Yesenia Guitron was hired as a personal banker at Wells Fargo’s St. Helena branch, in California’s Napa Valley. The sole provider for her two children, she had heard negative things about the environment at Wells, but she didn’t have many options. “The economy had shut down,” she recalls. “I needed the job.” Guitron soon discovered there was no shortage of internal publications that advised Wells employees on how to conduct themselves, including the Wells Fargo Code of Ethics and the Wells Fargo Team Member Handbook, which warned if an employee engaged in “manipulating or misrepresenting sales [gaming] in an attempt to meet sales goals or receive compensation” immediate termination could result. But soon after she was hired, Guitron saw a different reality. “I realized why all the other bankers had left,” she says. The pressure was intense. There were “morning huddle” meetings to discuss “Daily Solutions,” or sales goals for the day, and a manager would do hourly check-ins to see if each banker was making progress toward his or her quota, which in 2008 was eight products per day. (The number was increased in 2010 to 8.5.) “Call nights” were scheduled after the branch closed to “help” bankers who were having trouble meeting their sales goals, which were challenging in St. Helena. According to an analysis that was done for a lawsuit Guitron later filed, there were only about 11,500 potential customers in the area, and 11 other financial institutions. The quotas for the bankers at Guitron’s branch totaled 12,000 Daily Solutions each year, including almost 3,000 new checking accounts. Without fraud, the math didn’t work. “ALL THE TELLERS KNEW [OF THE FRAUDS], BUT . . . PEOPLE NEEDED THE JOB.” Twitter Guitron says that customers began coming to her, complaining about getting mail from Wells Fargo on accounts or services that they had never authorized. “People knew me and knew I could fix the problems,” she says. A common denominator, according to Guitron, was that most of the customers were Spanish-speaking, like her, so they didn’t feel comfortable going to management in English. “All the tellers and staff knew it, but no one else would complain,” Guitron says. “People needed the job. So did I, but I knew right from wrong.” On September 19, 2008, she sent an e-mail to her branch manager. “I have come across instances where I’ve opened accounts and shortly after they are closed and new sets of accounts are opened,” she wrote. “I find NO banker notes to explain why this is happening. I am very concerned as I know this to be GAMING!!!” She collected approximately 300 printouts of accounts that were problematic in various ways, she says, such as a minor having more than a dozen accounts. But, according to Guitron in legal documents, her manager would say only, “It’s a misunderstanding.” Or “You need to mind your own business.” Nothing changed, so Guitron requested meetings with more senior executives. Overall, she claimed that during her tenure at Wells Fargo she raised concerns on more than 100 occasions, including about a dozen calls to the Wells Fargo EthicsLine, and on no fewer than 37 occasions she provided records that supported her complaints. Guitron alleges that her managers began to retaliate, making it harder for her to meet her sales goals. She was fired in January 2010. In 2011, Guitron, along with another employee, Judi Klosek, who had made similar complaints, filed a whistle-blower lawsuit. The account printouts Guitron had collected were filed with the court, as were depositions from many other Wells Fargo employees. To cite but two: Irene Perez, who was the lead teller at the St. Helena branch from 2008 to 2011, claimed, “Everyone at the branch . . . was aware of the unethical conduct of bankers.” “It was normal business practices to use false identification on accounts and to change customers’ names and open new accounts,” said Dreydy Metelin, another personal banker at the branch, in her deposition. “Management made it clear that no employee was allowed to complain about the unethical practices that were going on within the branch.” Morally Bankrupt In 2012, the court ruled in Wells Fargo’s favor, mainly because Wells presented “clear and convincing evidence” that Guitron had, in fact, failed to meet her sales goals, so she would have been fired anyway. She appealed and lost again on the same basis. Her legal bills were more than $42,000, but the court reduced them to $18,675.70 based in part on the “significant difference between Wells Fargo’s resources and Guitron’s ability to pay.” (Wells Fargo would not comment on this matter.) Julie Tishkoff, an administrative assistant to a Wells Fargo regional president, said, according to her discrimination complaint, that around the same time, in 2005, she observed “fraudulent banking practices,” including bank employees’ “forging customer signatures and fraudulent[ly] opening accounts for customers without their knowledge or consent” and soliciting elderly or otherwise vulnerable customers to take out lines of credit even though they didn’t understand the product. Inevitably, customers began to sue, too. In the fall of 2013, David Douglas filed a lawsuit against Wells Fargo and three local employees, alleging that Wells bankers had opened eight accounts he didn’t want or know about, funding them with money from his legitimate accounts. Douglas contacted a Wells Fargo fraud investigator, who assured him they would look into it—but no one ever got back to him. His lawyer, Michael Kade, is currently also representing nine former Wells Fargo employees in a suit against the bank due to go to trial in the fall. The lawsuits continued to pile up, and a journalist finally noticed. In December 2013, E. Scott Reckard, then a reporter at the Los Angeles Times, wrote an article titled “Wells Fargo’s Pressure-Cooker Sales Culture Comes at a Cost.” He made the point that the “relentless pressure to sell has battered employee morale and led to ethical breaches, customer complaints and labor lawsuits.” The article caught the eye of Mike Feuer, a Harvard-trained lawyer and politician who had become the Los Angeles city attorney. He was shocked by the revelations in the piece, but he didn’t have subpoena power. So he asked his staff to investigate by doing what he calls “good old-fashioned detective work”—conducting dozens of interviews with current and former Wells Fargo employees and customers, going through court documents, and searching the C.F.P.B. and Federal Trade Commission consumer-complaint databases. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (O.C.C.), which is Wells Fargo’s regulator, also started to get complaints from customers and employees. One of the plaintiffs, Yasmeen Fasheh, began working at a Wells branch in Los Angeles in the spring of 2000. She alleged in a recently filed lawsuit that the pressure to cross-sell resulted in employees’ “impersonating customers” on Wells Fargo computers in order to enroll them in services without their consent, and selling to older customers on the belief that they wouldn’t review their bank statements. She alleged that she finally contacted Lefky Mansi, Wells’s longtime area president for Los Angeles. “You’re just a little ant in the company,” Fasheh alleges he responded. “If I’m going down, you’re going down, as well.” She called human resources too, which, she claims, told her “they were aware that these practices were occurring throughout the company, but there was nothing they could do.” (Wells Fargo declined to comment.) The Names of the Games Ken Mac, who worked at Wells Fargo’s Arcadia, California, branch over the summer of 2013, calls his brief stint at Wells “the lowest point of my life.” Mac, a fluent Chinese speaker, says that he got an elderly Chinese woman to sign up for a credit card she didn’t want by telling her “it was confirmation that she stopped by to update her address. I felt sick in my stomach,” he says, “but it was a tough economy, and I was worried, if I lost this job, I would be in a tough financial situation.” Ivan Rodriguez worked at three Wells Fargo branches in California, starting in 2007, and was quickly promoted to be a banker. There was pressure right away, but he knew he was in a sales job, and he thought, It is what it is. But he saw things: bankers changing customers’ phone numbers in the system so, if they complained, no one could get in touch with them; online banking accounts for elderly customers who didn’t know how to use computers. But the worst, he says, was the shredding. In order to get a signature on an account a customer didn’t want, bankers would cut a signature out of an existing account, scan that through, and then shred the evidence. They never got caught, because, in the branches he worked at, the manager would get 24 hours’ notice before Wells Fargo’s auditors came through. Indeed, according to a Wall Street Journal story, the advance notice that auditors were coming was common among Wells’s roughly 6,000 branches; more than a dozen employees told the Journal they’d either forged or seen colleagues forge signatures or shred the papers. (Wells Fargo has said it would eliminate the 24-hour notice of auditor visits.) On May 4, 2015, after his investigators had worked the case for 16 months, Feuer, the L.A. city attorney, filed a civil enforcement case against Wells. In the days following, his office got calls and e-mails from more than a thousand Wells Fargo customers and current and former employees describing a “veritable litany of horrific experiences,” as Jim Clark, Feuer’s chief deputy, put it to Congress. “Anecdotally, the feeling is that everyone knew,” says Jonathan Delshad, a lawyer who has filed a case on behalf of former Wells Fargo employees, and who says that more than 800 people have called his firm. “The better they did at sales, the more they advanced, so it got spread across the company. An entire generation of managers thrived in the culture, got rewarded for it, and are now in positions of power.” “AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF MANAGERS THRIVED IN THE CULTURE . . . AND ARE NOW IN POSITIONS OF POWER.” Twitter Delshad’s conclusion is echoed in a report done by Wells Fargo’s independent board members, which was released on April 10. “To many employees, the route to success was selling more than your peers,” the report stated. Even after the L.A. Times story, there were no dramatic changes. “What has mystified everybody and anybody, what other bank managements have asked me, is why, when the L.A. Times story hit, did you not rip the place apart and find out who was pushing these practices?” asks Nancy Bush, a bank analyst who has covered Wells Fargo for over three decades. The potential for problems was inherent in the strategy Dick Kovacevich created. Or, as Dennis Hambek says, “I think what Dick Kovacevich implemented was John Stumpf’s downfall.” Kovacevich was a larger-than-life C.E.O. As a Stanford baseball player, he sustained a shoulder injury that thwarted his plan to play in the major leagues. Instead, he earned an M.B.A. and started his career selling consumer products such as toys for General Mills. In the mid-1970s, he was recruited by Walter Wriston, of Citicorp, where he helped change the face of banking by rolling out Citi’s then revolutionary A.T.M.’s. But he was passed over for the top consumer job and was lured to Norwest in 1986. Looking back, a longtime Wells analyst says he is struck by the “enigma” that was Kovacevich. He exuded midwestern values, and in 1993, the year he became C.E.O., he began publishing the Wells Fargo Vision & Values, which featured such homilies as “In hiring, we really don’t care how much a person knows until we know how much they care.” But he also called financial services “the ultimate team sport,” and was extraordinarily intense and aggressive—even arrogant to some. “He was one of the most competitive people I have ever known,” says an executive who used to play tennis with him. “We were evenly matched, but he would win because winning was more important to him than it was to me—and I am competitive!” Although Kovacevich stressed ethics, he also said the most important metric of success was revenue growth. But calling a client a customer and a branch a store had a dark side, as the former executive points out, because it implicitly downgrades the bank’s level of responsibility toward its clients. Yet Kovacevich argued that “when customers vote with their pocket books, we know we’re doing something right.” Stumpf was a different character, more affable than arrogant. “If you were writing a movie script, this is not the guy you would want to play the villain,” says longtime banking analyst Mike Mayo. Stumpf was Minnesotan, through and through. He grew up on a farm, one of 11 children, and after college he worked as a repo man. “What got John most excited was talking about his days as a repo man,” says an investor who knows him well. “He has these vivid stories of repossessing cars while another guy would be the lookout guy.” Unlike Kovacevich, who would tell his executives, “The only thing I want to hear is bad news,” Stumpf seemed to be proud that the culture was one of “Minnesota nice.” He “was not perceived within Wells Fargo as someone who wanted to hear bad news or deal with conflict,” noted the board report. H.R. KNEW “THESE PRACTICES WERE OCCURRING . . . BUT [SAID] THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.” Twitter Nor was he the kind of C.E.O. to question Dick Kovacevich’s script. Indeed, he appropriated much of it. When asked why Wells Fargo had a cross-selling goal of eight, he’d say, “The answer is: it rhymed with ‘great!’ ” He was liked by investors—what wasn’t to like?—but for better and worse, he didn’t have the presence that Kovacevich had had. He was less self-aggrandizing, but he also seemed to some to be more of a big-picture C.E.O. than one who was enmeshed in the dirty minutiae of operations. “I never felt he had a detailed grip on the intricacies of the business,” says an investor. “There was nothing remarkable about the guy,” says another investor. “I always thought [until the scandal] that he was dealt a really good hand.” Paradoxically the hard-core sales culture seemed to intensify once Stumpf took over. In 2010, both the compensation and performance ratings systems were rejiggered so that they were associated with sales goals. Bankers, branch managers, and district managers risked pay cuts and poor performance reviews if they didn’t hit the goals, noted the board report, and employees were ranked against one another. The pressure was greatest in California, Arizona, and Florida. Pam Conboy, who ran Wells’s Arizona regional banking from 2007 to 2017 and who had taken Arizona from last place to first in sales rankings, gave a presentation at a 2010 leadership conference in which she encouraged the use of “morning huddles” to discuss the previous day’s sales reports, and told district managers they should call to check on branches multiple times a day. Another executive, named Shelley Freeman, who ran the Los Angeles region until 2009, and then Florida, would have district managers “run the gauntlet”: each would have to dress up in a themed costume and run down the line to a whiteboard to report the number of sales they had achieved. According to the board report, on a per-employee basis, the reports of sales-practice misconduct tripled from the second quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2013. Kovacevich told someone who knows him that he would never have tolerated this treatment of employees, which he has described as “harassment.” He has called the issues during his tenure “infinitesimal.” Job Wells Done Stumpf had risen through the ranks, and so did Carrie Tolstedt, the daughter of a baker who had started her career at Norwest in Nebraska, in 1986. She and Stumpf were a symbiotic pair. Tolstedt wasn’t flashy either, and impressed investors as a detail-oriented, hardworking operator; a former Wells executive says she “worked 16 hours a day, 7 days a week.” Stumpf’s support for her was extraordinary. He thought “she was the ‘most brilliant’ Community Banker he had ever met,” the board report noted. In return she delivered the numbers he wanted to see. Tolstedt told investors that customers who had five products with Wells Fargo were three times as profitable as those with three products, while those with eight products were five times as profitable. Additionally, the more accounts a customer had, the less likely it was that he or she would switch to another bank paying higher rates of interest. One investor argues that was a key reason that Wells, for years, had a lower cost of funds than its peers. This was a critical advantage because it allowed Wells to price loans lower than other big banks could and still make the same profit. Said Warren Buffett in a 2009 interview, “The key to the future of Wells is continuing to get the money in at very low costs.” Wells’s stock price soared, and Tolstedt, whose salary was $1.75 million, received more than $20 million in annual bonuses from 2010 to 2015, which was justified in part by the “record cross-sell results” in her division, said Wells in its financial filings. But Stumpf and the rest of the executive team, and soon the board, knew there were issues. It wasn’t just the press and the Los Angeles city attorney. In 2011, a group of bankers who were terminated for sales violations wrote a letter to Stumpf, arguing that their actions had not only been condoned by management in their branch, but that similar things were happening across the bank. Multiple task forces were convened. Lisa Stevens, who became the head of the West Coast region in 2010 and reported directly to Tolstedt, was complaining by 2012 to the bank’s corporate chief risk officer, Mike Loughlin, about “unrealistic sales goals and her frustration with Community Bank leadership,” according to the board report. Wells did take some small steps, and by at least some measures, the sales problem did begin improving in 2013. But Wells’s response was incremental, not Draconian. One explanation is that executives failed to see the scope of the problem because of the way Wells Fargo was structured. Kovacevich had always run the company in a decentralized way, so much so that he’d refer to himself as a “C.E.O. of C.E.O.’s.” Functions such as risk management, legal, and human resources were not run at the corporate level, and employees reported to, say, the head of Community Banking, or the head of Wells’s much smaller business bank. This meant that Tolstedt, in effect, had her own empire, with her own risk-management head, Claudia Russ Anderson, reporting to her, rather than to anyone at the corporate level. For corporate executives, the structural difficulty of seeing inside the retail bank was complicated by Tolstedt herself. “She is widely viewed as building a community bank and making it a business success—and it was,” says one person who is familiar with Wells Fargo. “But by all accounts she was mercurial, very wary of others, and apparently not the type that wanted bad news to surface.” She viewed the sales model as the key to the community bank’s success, and didn’t want to take any steps that might “impede its operation,” noted the board report, which also alleged she was “obsessed with control.” For instance, when Tolstedt found out that Lisa Stevens had been complaining, she told Stevens to “toe the line.” (Tolstedt declined to comment for this article.) It’s convenient now to place the blame on Tolstedt and on Wells’s model, but that’s not the whole truth. Kovacevich, for his part, noted to someone who knows him that the fact that Stevens was complaining was proof that the decentralized model worked. It’s just that no one in leadership wanted to hear it, or as the board report noted, “Many observers expressed their belief that Tolstedt operated the Community Bank in the way she did because she thought Stumpf would approve.” And he did, wholeheartedly. After Feuer filed his suit, Stumpf sent an e-mail to another executive. “I have worked over the weekend with Carrie on the LA issue—I really feel for Carrie and her team,” he wrote. “We do such a good job in this area. I will fight this one to the finish. Do you know only around 1% of our people lose their jobs [for] gaming the system . . . . Did some do things wrong —you bet and that is called life. This is not systemic.” Relying on the statistic that only 1 percent of employees were being fired annually is an easy way to minimize the problem, because it’s a measure of one thing only: the people who got caught. It didn’t represent those who encouraged gaming, or those who were fired for lack of production, or those who just left because they disapproved of the culture, like Rodriguez. The turnover at the lower levels of the community bank ran at 30 percent to 40 percent annually. Inside Wells, says lawyer Jonathan Delshad, the attitude was “Do what you have to do, but don’t get caught.” After the 2013 Los Angeles Times article, the board, at least according to its own report, got involved. Initially, they believed the problem was relatively small and was being addressed. After Feuer’s office filed its lawsuit in 2015, members of the risk committee asked for another presentation on sales-practice issues. It is unclear who was involved in the presentation, but board members left with the impression that only about 200 to 300 people in Southern California had been terminated. Multiple board members later complained to investigators that they felt “misled.” “MANAGEMENT MADE IT CLEAR THAT NO EMPLOYEE WAS ALLOWED TO COMPLAIN.” Twitter By the end of the year, two directors had told Stumpf over dinner that Tolstedt should go. Finally, on July 12, 2016, Wells announced that she would retire at the end of the year. Stumpf called her a “standard-bearer of our culture, a champion for our customers, and a role model for responsible, principled and inclusive leadership.” Because she was retiring, not being fired, her stock in the company, accumulated over her years at Wells Fargo, was expected to be worth up to $124 million. But if Wells could ignore its employees and its customers, and placate its board, its regulators were a different matter. Less than a week after the announcement that Tolstedt would retire, the O.C.C. sent a confidential letter to Stumpf, along with a report on its findings, which concluded that “the Bank’s sales practices were unethical; the Bank’s actions caused harm to consumers; and Bank management had not responded promptly to address these issues.” The O.C.C. had begun coordinating with Feuer’s office, and the C.F.P.B. also joined the fray. In early September they announced the joint $185 million settlement. Newly Minted? There may be no greater testament to the level of delusion inside Wells Fargo than the fact that executives were completely shocked by the outpouring of rage. Finally, Wells announced that it would do what it had long been unwilling to do: eliminate all product sales goals in retail banking. On October 12, as the outcry intensified, Stumpf announced he’d step down as C.E.O., and forfeit $41 million. After its investigation, the board stripped him of another $28 million and clawed back $19 million from Tolstedt. After concluding its report, they stripped her of another $47.3 million. (A lawyer for Tolstedt said, “We strongly disagree with the report and its attempt to lay blame with Ms. Tolstedt. A full and fair examination of the facts will produce a different conclusion.”) A handful of other executives, including Claudia Russ Anderson, Pam Conboy, and Shelley Freeman, were fired. Wells Fargo’s new C.E.O. is Tim Sloan, who spent most of his career not in the retail bank working with consumers but rather catering to big business clients before becoming C.F.O. and then C.O.O. Sloan is clearly not a break with the past, but, as a former Wells Fargo executive says, “he is a very different guy” from Stumpf. “No one has ever seen John Stumpf angry, and I literally can’t remember ever hearing him swear,” this person says. “Tim is much more hard-core.” Already, Sloan has made many changes. Functions such as human resources are being centralized at headquarters, so information can be dissected in multiple ways. Cross-selling, it seems, has become a dirty phrase. Wells now talks about “Mutual Value Exchange,” which seems to boil down to providing products that customers actually want and use. Wall Street isn’t sure what to think. Wells Fargo’s stock has regained the $30 billion it lost, which is as much a sign of optimism about deregulation in the new administration as anything. But “we gave them too much credit for being Superman in the banking industry,” says one major investor. “Now the cape has come off, and Wall Street is realizing they are just like everyone else and no better than anyone else.” Regardless of what happens, the story still tells an uncomfortable tale of how business, not just the business of banking, but all business, all too often works in the modern era. “I’m a notary,” Yesenia Guitron tells me. “I can only charge $10 for my services. But I’m told that, if I failed to take someone’s proper identification when I’m notarizing something for them, I could go to jail for 10 years.” How, she wonders, can you square the large consequences she’d have to face for a small misdeed for which she was paid a small amount with the small consequences for large-scale wrongdoing where the people in charge earned fortunes? The short answer is you can’t. Full ScreenPhotos: 1/12Wall Street’s 12 Most Salacious Scandals MARTHA STEWART The domestic doyenne, known primarily for teaching a whole class of homemakers the virtues of a perfectly-timed soufflé or a perfectly-folded sheet, imperfectly found herself in the Big House for five months in 2004, after she was convicted for conspiracy and obstruction of justice related to selling shares of drugmaker ImClone Systems.Photo: Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From NBC/Getty Images (Stewart). MARTIN SHKRELI The so-called “pharma-bro” created a national media frenzy when he hiked the price of a lifesaving drug by 5,000 percent overnight in 2015, and continued to fan the flames by buying a $2 million single-copy Wu-Tang Clan album and picking fights with presidential candidates. In the midst of the firestorm, he also got arrested and charged with 8 counts of fraud after prosecutors accusing him of using a public drug company he ran as a personal piggybank to pay back investors whose money he lost at his now-defunct hedge funds.Photo: Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Shkreli). BERNIE MADOFF The name Bernie Madoff has become synonymous with reprehensible greed after the Wall Street fraudster was caught stealing his victims’ fortunes to live like a king. Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison—the maximum for his crimes—after pleading guilty to 11 counts of myriad financial crimes related to a Ponzi scheme that swallowed up $10 billion of investors’ money.Photo: Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Madoff). ALLEN STANFORD In the early 2000s, Allen Stanford was enjoying the spoils of a $7 billion Ponzi scheme—a knighthood awarded by Antigua, a handful of yachts, $2 billion to his name, and a cricket team of his very own. But the international fraud empire he built over the course of two decades, in which he offered phony high-interest certificates of deposit at a bank he started in Antigua, imploded. He was charged with 13 counts of wire and mail fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering and sentenced to 110 years in prison without parole.Photo: Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Stanford). MATHEW MARTOMA Over the course of several days in July of 2008, Mathew Martoma sealed his fate. That was when the former S.A.C. Capital portfolio manager allegedly used inside information about a clinical trial for Alzheimer’s drugs to bring in a windfall for his firm. Martoma was one of about 85 individuals who were either convicted of or pleaded guilty in the ensuing investigation that rocked Wall Street, though Martoma’s 9-year sentence was on the harsher side. A judge ruled that he also had to forfeit nearly $9.5 million in bonuses he received while working at S.A.C. in 2008, including the Boca Raton home he bought for $2 million.Photo: Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Splash News (Martoma). SAGE KELLY By Wall Street standards, Sage Kelly had it all: a cushy, $7 million-a-year gig running Jefferies’s health-care investment-banking unit, a home in Sag Harbor, a growing family, and a group of buddies to pal around with. But it all came crashing down when his wife filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that they had engaged in a foursome with clients and that he would often take so many drugs that he would pee all over their home. Jefferies denied all of the allegations and Kelly’s wife later recanted the statements, but the banker found himself out of a job for two years.Photo: Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Splash News (Kelly). BRUNO IKSIL Bruno Iksil earned himself the moniker the “London Whale” for a $6.2 billion trading loss he made on J.P. Morgan’s ledger in 2012. The Frenchman, who contends that his risky trades were made at the behest of his superiors, avoided any sort of prosecution. But the bank was subject to government probes and $900 million in regulatory fines, and its C.E.O., Jamie Dimon, took a 50 percent pay cut.Photo: Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Iksil).

While federal investigators circled Cohen and his firm, S.A.C. Capital, for nearly a decade, only his employees were convicted of wrongdoing, while Cohen was never nailed. His firm pleaded guilty to insider trading and forker over a record $1.8 billion fine, but all Cohen got was a two-year ban on managing outside money—a most gentle slap on the wrist from the S.E.C. while he happily manages his family office and prepares for his next steps in the hedge fund world. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Cohen). RAJ RAJARATNAM Raj Rajaratnam was a frugal billionaire of sorts—opting to fly commercial and flouting the fancy art and high-end collectables that many of his fellow hedge fund managers favored. But he was also keen on skirting the law, a court found. Rajaratnam was charged with trading on inside information in 2009 and convicted on 14 counts of conspiracy and securities fraud in case considered to be one of the biggest prosecutorial wins in white collar criminal history. He is currently serving out his 11 years in the main prison at the Federal Medical Center at Devens in Ayer, Massachusetts. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Rajaratnam). MICHAEL MILKEN That billionaire Michael Milken, the high-flying junk bond king of Beverly Hills, found himself sobbing in front of a courtroom in 1990 as he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, surely felt like a cruel twist of fate. That he ended up there because another convicted fraudster, Ivan Boesky, traded his name as part of his insider trading charges, surely felt even crueler. Milken was originally charged with 98 counts of racketeering, securities fraud, and mail fraud, though he pleaded guilty to just six counts of conspiracy and fraud related to illegal securities trading. He was ordered to pay $600 million in fines. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Milken). JEFFREY SKILLING Jeffrey Skilling was the chief executive of Enron when the energy-trading giant crumbled under the weight of its accounting schemes, which hid the scope of its financial woes and stripped billions of dollars from shareholders and employees. He was initially sentenced to 24 years in prison—a punishment that was later reduced to 14 years and a $42 fine. He reportedly spent his time behind bars tutoring in Spanish and reading the newspaper to a blind inmate each day. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Skilling). R. FOSTER WINANS A scheme that netted less than $1 million in profits and resulted in an 18-month jail sentence is hardly the sexiest on this list, but the transgression is perhaps the most unusual. Former Wall Street Jornal columnist R. Foster Winans admitted that in the early 1980s, he would slip Peter Brand information about a stock he would be featuring in his column, “Heard on the Street”—the contents of which would often move markets. Brant would make trades based on the early information, and Winans would receive a kickback in kind. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Winans).

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Deals | Wed May 31, 2017 | 6:40am EDT China's Zhong An aims to raise at least $1 billion in Hong Kong IPO - sources By Julie Zhu | HONG KONG HONG KONG Zhong An Online Property and Casualty Insurance, China's first online-only insurer, has resumed a plan to raise $1 billion or more in a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) in the second half of this year, said two people with knowledge of the matter. Zhong An, whose major shareholders include Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) affiliate Ant Financial, plans to apply for listing in the coming weeks, said one of the people, who declined to be identified as the matter is confidential. The Shanghai-based insurer chose Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and UBS in October to lead the IPO, but later suspended the plan to explore a mainland listing. The following February, Reuters reported that the mainland securities regulator was considering streamlining the IPO approval process for large domestic technology firms, such as Zhong An. But lack of progress on the matter prompted Zhong An to opt for Hong Kong, though it would prefer to list in mainland China, one of the people said. "Zhong An has always wanted to list at home but given an A-share IPO is unlikely in the short-term, the company has to come back to Hong Kong to go public and raise fresh capital to expand its business first," said the person, referring to a class of shares on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. "A domestic listing later is certainly under consideration," the person told Reuters. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has also appeared to slow its IPO process, with seven approvals last week versus a weekly average of 10 in recent months. As of Friday, applications to list in Shanghai or Shenzhen numbered about 600. Zhong An and UBS declined to comment. Credit Suisse and JPMorgan did not respond to requests for comment. HK COUP A Zhong An IPO would be a coup for the Hong Kong stock exchange which has struggled to attract technology listings due to strict profitability and voting rights requirements, bourse Chief Executive Charles Li said this month. Hong Kong famously lost out to New York on Alibaba's 2014 record IPO, sparking a broader debate about the bourse's listing rules. Zhong An was founded in November 2013 by Alibaba Executive Chairman Jack Ma, Tencent Chairman Pony Ma and Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd (601318.SS) (2318.HK) Chairman Ma Mingzhe. It offers more than 300 niche products, many of which are low-cost, including policies covering flight delays, cracked mobile phone screens and shipping costs for returning goods bought online. Ant Financial and Ping An declined to comment. Tencent did not respond to requests for comment.

Lloyds Banking Group, Standard Chartered and Barclays declined 0.9%, 1.0% and 1.2%, respectively. Royal Bank of Scotland Group slipped 0.4%, after a group of investors accepted an out-of-court settlement of £200.0 million from the bank. International Consolidated Airlines Group dropped 1.4%, after its passengers were grounded at Heathrow airport over the holiday weekend due to a worldwide computer system failure at the airline. Tesco slid 0.8%, amid news that UK’s competition regulator formally began an investigation into its planned £3.7 billion takeover of Booker Group, down, 1.0%.  On the flipside, London Stock Exchange Group advanced 1.5%, after it agreed to acquire Citigroup’s fixed income indices and analytics businesses in a cash deal of about $685.0 million. The FTSE 100 declined 0.3%, to close at 7,526.5, while the FTSE 250 fell 0.2%, to settle at 19,991.9. US Market Snapshot US markets closed in negative territory yesterday, weighed down by a slump in energy and financial sector stocks. Lenders, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs Group declined 1.4%, 1.7% and 2.3%, respectively. Oil majors, Exxon Mobil and Chevron slipped 0.6%, each, tracking losses in crude prices. Bucking the trend, Protagonist Therapeutics rallied 43.8%, after the company entered into a collaboration agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutical, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, up 0.2%, to develop a drug for inflammatory bowel disease. Atwood Oceanics soared 24.3%, after Ensco, down 5.1%, announced that it would acquire the former in an all-stock deal valued at $6.9 billion.

The DJIA shed 0.2%, to settle at 21,029.5, while the NASDAQ slid 0.1%, to close at 6,203.2. Europe Market Snapshot Other European markets ended in the red yesterday, led by losses in banking sector stocks after a leading broker downgraded its rating on the banks to ‘Underweight’, stating that weak growth in the Euro-zone would weigh on the sector in the coming period. Investor sentiment was further dented amid concerns over early elections in Italy and likelihood of Greece defaulting on its debt payment. Lenders, Societe Generale, Banco BPM and BNP Paribas declined 1.4%, 2.3% and 4.1%, respectively. Akzo Nobel dropped 1.8%, after a Dutch court rejected Elliott Management’s demand to remove the company’s Chairman, Antony Burgmans, thus strengthening the company’s resistance to a takeover approach from PPG Industries. The FTSEurofirst 300 index declined 0.2%, to close at 1,533.7. Among other European markets, the German DAX Xetra 30 slid 0.2%, to close at 12,598.7, while the French CAC-40 shed 0.5%, to settle at 5,305.9. Asia Market Snapshot Markets in Asia are trading mostly higher this morning, amid upbeat manufacturing PMI data for May in China. In Japan, energy majors, Japan Petroleum Exploration and Inpex have declined 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively, on lower crude oil prices. On the contrary, Panasonic has advanced 2.4%, after the company projected a robust growth in its sales in the year ending March 2022. In Hong Kong, gaming stocks, Galaxy Entertainment Group, Sands China and Melco International Development have risen 0.8%, 1.1% and 1.4%, respectively.

Big Bank Stocks Could Be Heading Higher. Despite the recent pain, Credit Suisse analysts continue to see double-digit returns universal bank stocks. By Ben Levisohn May 30, 2017 3:37 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Bank stocks like Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Bank of America (BAC) entered 2017 on a rather remarkable run, but since then they have underperformed: The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) has dropped 4.9% so far this year. Illustration: Getty Images A combination of factors, including a still slow growing U.S. economy, the failure of the Trump administration to pass its growth-boosting measures, and the flattening of the yield curve have caused banks to underperform in 2017. Still, Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke and team remain bullish on so-called "universal banks," particularly Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. They explain why: ~10-15% upside in recommended names; expect volatility. Given the speed and magnitude of the post-election outperformance, it’s fair to anticipate a good bit of volatility in the stocks—typical at this point in the economic cycle, but also reflective of heightened policy uncertainty (tax reform, regulatory reform, fiscal stimulus plans). We will continue to assess valuations cognizant of the economic cycle, but equally as willing to embrace the changed/changing operating environment. All in, our base case estimates translate to 11% year to year EPS growth and a 13% ROTCE, on average in 2017, with substantial variance around the averages. Our blue sky estimates are ~25% above base case, with near equal incremental upside in the stocks. Looking at a weighted average of our blue sky, base case and gray sky scenarios translates to ~10-15% total return in our recommended names—BAC, JPM, C and GS. We strongly favor the universal banking model, with its multiple levers for growth and greater potential for realization of scale economies. Shares of Bank of America have fallen 1.4% to $22.90 at 3:30 p.m. today, while JPMorgan Chase has dropped 1.6% to $83.96, Citigroup has declined 0.6% to $61.72, and Goldman Sachs has tumbled 2% to $218.3.7 Text Size Regular Medium Large Stocks PREVIOUS No, Electric Cars Won't Kill Oil Stocks...At Least Not All of Them NEXT Signet Jewelers: Pricing in 'Draconian' Downside?

Photo: Reuters Reuters May 31 2017 2:30 AM 0 Comments Political concerns dent global sentiment Independent.ie Oil prices slid yesterday on concerns of a persistent global supply glut while US and European political worries combined to subdue investor sentiment and weaken equity markets around the world. http://www.independent.ie/business/world/political-concerns-dent-global-sentiment-35773261.html http://www.independent.ie/incoming/article35772927.ece/6be28/AUTOCROP/h342/LSE%202.jpg Email Oil prices slid yesterday on concerns of a persistent global supply glut while US and European political worries combined to subdue investor sentiment and weaken equity markets around the world. But JPMorgan global equity strategists said they expect UK stocks to claw back some of their underperformance against eurozone and global peers and recommended investors buy into blue-chip, dividend-paying exporters that stand to benefit the most from a weak sterling. "We think UK is becoming interesting in the regional allocation again," JPMorgan's strategists said, adding that signs that investors have turned less risk-averse since early May also bodes well for London-listed stocks. "(The) UK is a defensive market with high dividend yield. It should perform better in the backdrop of potential softening in activity indicators, lower inflation prints and continued range-bound bond yields," JPMorgan said. In Ireland, the ISEQ Overall Index ended the session in positive territory, unlike many of its European peers. It closed up 0.34pc at 6.995.83. Shares in Ryanair surged 3.7pc to €18.42 as the airline reported full-year results and CEO Michael O'Leary said the carrier will extend leases and buy a handful of extra planes from Boeing to meet demand next summer. The carrier also launched a €600m share buyback. Shares in food group Aryzta tumbled nearly 9pc as it reported third quarter results that showed its margins remain under pressure. Bank of Ireland was 2.5pc lower at 24 cent, while betting group Paddy Power Betfair also fell 2.5pc, to €93.02. The UK's FTSE-100 edged 0.28pc lower. France's CAC-40 was down 0.5pc and Germany's DAX retreated 0.2pc.

Presented by Strategic Staffing Solutions, hundreds of guests, including business and community leaders, families and young professionals, will be treated to an unforgettable evening of music, performance art, gourmet bites, traditional festival food and free carnival games and rides with GM River Days serving as a backdrop. “Shimmer on the River is a celebration of the Detroit Riverfront,” said Mark Wallace, president and CEO of the Detroit RiverFront Conservancy. “The proceeds from the event help to ensure that the Detroit Riverfront remains a clean, safe, and beautiful gathering place for everyone.” This year’s Shimmer will be hosted by Co-Chairs Matt Simoncini, president, chief executive officer and director, Lear Corporation and Jason Tinsley, executive director, J.P. Morgan Private Bank along with the Shimmer Host Committee. “I am proud to support a wonderful organization that is making our riverfront more accessible for our community,” said Matt Simoncini, president, chief executive officer and director, Lear Corporation and Co-Chair of Shimmer. “This event celebrates not only how far the Detroit Riverfront has evolved over the last 10 years, but also what’s to come.” “I’m excited to be a part of Shimmer benefiting the Detroit RiverFront Conservancy,” said Jason Tinsley, executive director, J.P. Morgan Private Bank and Co-Chair of Shimmer. “It’s great to see millions of Detroiters and visitors come together to enjoy the riverfront each year.” A VIP cocktail reception will take place earlier in the evening with a champagne toast.

Sun-Sentinel A stranded traveler checks flight information May 9 at the Fort Lauderdale International Airport, where Spirit had canceled flights due to a labor dispute. Repeated cancellations by Spirit led to a melee among travelers this month. JOE CAVARETTA (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) Sun-Sentinel Business May 29, 2017 9:55 PM The route to air-travel discomfort starts on Wall Street By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ New York Times LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story When an unlucky passenger was violently dragged off a full United Airlines flight in Chicago in April, setting off a public-relations nightmare for the company, the blame naturally fell on the cabin crew, police and eventually airline executives. But ultimately, the episode was set in motion elsewhere – on Wall Street. Relentless pressure on corporate America is creating an increasingly Dickensian experience for many consumers as companies focus on maximizing profit. And nowhere is the trend as stark as in the airline industry, whose service is delivered in an aluminum tube packed with up to four different classes, cheek by jowl, 35,000 feet in the air. “There’s always been pressure from Wall Street,” said Robert L. Dilenschneider, a veteran public relations executive who advises companies and chief executives on strategic communications. “But I’ve been watching this for 30 years, and it’s never been as intense as it is today.” Rich bonus packages for top executives are now largely tied to short-term income targets and fatter profit margins instead of customer service. Of course, bolstering profits – and in turn, stock prices – has always been a big part of management’s responsibility to shareholders, but making it virtually the only criterion for executive pay is new. Five years ago, American Airlines factored in on-time arrivals, lost baggage and consumer complaints to help calculate annual incentive payments for top management. Today, these bonuses are based exclusively on the company’s pretax income and cost savings. United has also scaled back bonuses linked to reliability and customer satisfaction for senior executives in recent years. But in the wake of what happened in April, bonuses “will be made more comprehensively subject to progress in 2017 on significant improvement in the customer experience,” the company said in a financial filing. “Fifteen years ago, airlines competed with each other over who could buy the most planes or have the most routes,” said Jamie Baker, a top airline industry analyst at JPMorgan Chase. “Executives are just as competitive today, but it’s about who can achieve an investment-grade rating first, who can be a component in the S&P 500, and who has better returns for investors.” These new incentives also partly explain why airlines are packing seats more densely and squeezing more passengers into the back of the plane. “Densification is driven by the desire to sweat the assets and generate revenues without having to commit capital to building new planes,” Baker said. Such a shift isn’t unique to the airline industry. “As in other industries, like manufacturing or consumer goods, the focus is on more traditional financial metrics like pretax income, margins, return on capital and total shareholder return,” said Andrew Goldstein, head of the executive compensation practice in North America for Willis Towers Watson. “Airlines haven’t abandoned operational and customer-service metrics, but they are putting less emphasis on those factors.” With the economy growing at a rate of only 2 percent while the stock market rallies on promises of soaring earnings, something must give so profit margins can grow. In the case of United or Spirit Airlines, whose repeated cancellations led to a melee among travelers this month at a terminal in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, it was customer service. At other companies, like Ford and Alcoa, it was the head of the chief executive that was served up when profits failed to meet expectations. Mature industries – where double-digit annual profit growth is a reach in the best of times – are especially vulnerable to activist investors’ demands for board seats, bigger stock repurchases and other short-term financial rewards. The pressure is especially brutal in the airline industry because the key expense, fuel, is for the most part beyond management control. Yet airline executives have largely convinced Wall Street that the bad old days of bankruptcies and fare wars are over, replaced by the kind of predictable annual profits more common among industrial companies. That’s among the reasons fees have popped up in recent years for everything from checking bags to securing an assigned seat before boarding. Known on Wall Street as ancillary revenue, this stream of income is especially favored by investors because it doesn’t swing sharply the way fares do. And so far, despite occasional bouts of air rage and frequent consumer complaints, Wall Street has been getting what it wants. United’s stock has surged to more than $80 per share from $25 per share five years ago, with profit margins rising to 13.6 percent from 3.7 percent over the same period. Overall industry margins hit 16.3 percent, up from 5.2 percent in 2012. Spirit’s operating margins are among the highest in the industry, topping 20 percent in 2015 and 2016. But Paul Berry, a company spokesman, said Spirit had pivoted to focus more on customer service in the last year, even as some larger rivals keep cutting costs to compete. Despite rewarding top executives strictly according to financial targets, American said it, too, was committed to improving the passenger experience. “Every single person at American knows we succeed or fail based on how well we serve customers,” said Joshua Freed, a company spokesman. “We will only meet those financial goals if we keep our customers happy.” Still, the promise of steady profit growth has prompted even Warren E. Buffett to take a fresh look at airline stocks. He once famously called the industry a money-losing “death trap,” but reversed course late last year, with his company, Berkshire Hathaway, acquiring stakes in several airlines. “In the past, airline stocks were seen as hazardous to one’s wealth,” said Baker, the JPMorgan analyst. “They were trading vehicles, and potential destroyers of capital.” To be sure, some industry veterans insist it is a mistake to simply blame investors or hedge-fund managers for fostering a race to the bottom in customer service. “The response isn’t to Wall Street. It’s to customer behavior,” said Alex Dichter, a senior partner at McKinsey who works with major airlines. “About 35 percent of customers are choosing on price, and price alone, and another 35 percent choose mostly on price.” Dichter noted that when American added 2-4 inches of legroom in coach in the early 2000s, “as far as I know, the airline didn’t see one bit of improvement in market share or pricing.” “The great irony is that most CEOs would love to compete on product and experience,” he added. “It’s much more fun. The problem is that customers aren’t paying attention to that.” LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Suggested for you   Comments   Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email a day ago "The end of an era": Customers, employees bid farewell to Bow Wow on closing day 1:12 a day ago "The end of an era": Customers, employees bid farewell to Bow Wow on closing day 2:27 3 days ago Now founder Nathan Barry hustled to land initial clients for Boise startup ConvertKit 0:35 13 days ago Growing Fresca Mexican Foods to expand with Caldwell plant View More Video Business The Latest: Canada woman among those killed on London Bridge Correction: Plant Explosion-Wisconsin story South Korea draws up $10 billion extra budget to create jobs US energy chief reassures Japan of commitment to environment Lawmakers leave behind school vouchers, face budget dispute Business Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Subscriber Services E-Edition (Digital Replica) Home Delivery Vacation Hold Newsletters Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Photo Store Archive Search Social, Mobile & More Mobile & Apps Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Instagram Advertising Information Place a Classified Local Deals Shopping Place an Obituary Today's Circulars More Copyright Privacy Policy Terms of Service

Saudi, Bahrain, Egypt and UAE cut ties with Qatar The Edit: Pint glass becomes symbol of London’s defiance ‘Modern-day bank robbery’ lands Malaysian in Aussie jail Advertisement More stories                Tools Increase Text Decrease Text Reset Text Print Article Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk giving a talk at the prestigious TED Conference in Vancouver. — AFP picWASHINGTON, June 1 — As Donald Trump nears a final decision on the Paris climate agreement, top corporate executives are mounting a last-minute push aimed at persuading the president that the US has more to lose from abandoning the accord. The appeals from chief executives such as Tesla Inc’s Elon Musk, Tim Cook of Apple Inc and Dow Chemical Co’s Andrew Liveris come as Trump’s advisers also present him with closing arguments on the potential risks and rewards of remaining a party to the global pact. Trump also got an earful from foreign leaders and Pope Francis urging him to stay in the agreement during his first international trip as president. Cook placed a call to the White House on Tuesday to urge the president to keep the US in the agreement, according to a person familiar with the move. Liveris was the driving force behind a letter from 30 major company executives backing the deal. And Musk tweeted yesterday that he has “done all I can to advise directly to” Trump. If the US leaves Paris, Musk said he would drop participation in White House advisory councils. Corporate leaders “are continuing to try to get through to the White House in any and every way they can,” said Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, the non-profit sustainability advocacy that works with investors. They “are particularly important stakeholders for this president,” she said. The executives are trying to capitalise on Trump’s “America first” ideology by warning that a withdrawal would put the US at a disadvantage in a global race to develop and deploy clean-energy technology, potentially ceding that market opportunity to China, the world’s top emitter of greenhouse gas emissions. A television advertisement that began running yesterday cites 10 of “America’s biggest CEOs,” including JPMorgan Chase & Co’s Jamie Dimon and General Electric Co’s Jeffrey Immelt, as backing the climate pact “because it will benefit American manufacturing and generate jobs.” Trump tweeted yesterday that he would announce his decision on the Paris accord “over the next few days.” He later told reporters he was hearing from many people on both sides of the issue. While Trump is leaning toward exiting the pact, according to people familiar with the White House deliberations, the situation remained fluid amid intense last-minute lobbying. The people requested anonymity because Trump’s decision has not yet been officially announced. It was unclear yesterday whether the corporate appeals would have much influence. Asked about Musk’s threat to forfeit his role on several of Trump’s advisory councils, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer noted “the president has a lot of people who he gets a lot of input from.” “Let’s wait and see what the president’s decision is,” Spicer said. Twenty-five companies, including Intel Corp, Microsoft Corp and PG&E Corp, have signed on to a letter set to run as a full-page advertisement in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal today arguing in favour of the climate pact, and warning of potential “retaliatory measures” by other nations. “By expanding markets for innovative clean technologies, the agreement generates jobs and economic growth,” the open letter says. “US companies are well positioned to lead in these markets. Withdrawing from the agreement will limit our access to them and could expose us to retaliatory measures.” Some companies that favour continued US involvement in the deal stand to benefit directly from greater worldwide demand for lower-emitting energy sources, such as natural gas and renewable power. For instance, natural gas producers Exxon Mobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc have endorsed the pact, as has Cheniere Energy Inc, which exports liquefied natural gas. Not all corporations are in line on the Paris agreement. Some coal producers, including Murray Energy Corp, oppose the pact. Robert E Murray, the founder and chief executive officer of the mining company, told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday that Trump has a responsibility to fulfill his campaign pledges and jettison the agreement. The president should “listen to those who voted for him,” Murray said. Environmentalists are hoping the corporate advocacy will have more influence with the president, as they haven’t been able to get traction. “It’s up to world leaders and responsible companies like Apple and Tesla to use whatever influence they have with Trump while they can,” said Travis Nichols, a spokesman for Greenpeace USA. “Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement would turn America from a global climate leader into a global climate deadbeat. These companies are on the right side of history.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Malaysia Airlines close to deal for more widebody Airbus planes Pound falls after London terror attacks raise political tensions Ringgit opens higher against US dollar PBOC has economy's back even as it squeezes leverage from market Oil subdued as rising US output undermines Opec effort to cut supply Ringgit likely to trade higher versus US dollar next week RHB-AmBank to take No. 1 spot in asset management, insurance, broking Petronas Q1 2017 pre-tax profit more than doubles to RM15.5b British pound in thrall to election projections as market jitters rise Bursa to be firmer next week Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: With rave reviews, 'Wonder Woman' readies to launch Reuters Video: Francois Ozon's 'L'Amant Double' shocks at Cannes Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles US states, cities and firms unite behind Paris accord (VIDEO) Apple’s Cook says disappointed in US exit from climate pact Trump announces US withdrawal from Paris climate deal (VIDEO) Musk jumps off Trump train in wake of Paris pullout decision Musk to quit advisory panels if Trump withdraws from climate deal (VIDEO) Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

Thanks for reading and posting comments - we'll be back tomorrow from 9am. 4:46pm on 1 Jun 2017 Shares see-sawed throughout the session before finishing in the black, after soft Chinese manufacturing data clashed with solid local retail sales growth. Investors bought up utilities and healthcare stocks, while Wesfarmers weighed on consumer staples and a dip in the oil price saw energy names sold off.  The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index and the broader All Ordinaries Index each finishing up 0.2 per cent to 5738.1 points and 5772.5 points respectively.  "There's nothing really strong giving investors conviction at the moment," said James Gerrish, senior investment adviser at Shaw & Partners.  "But investors are likely to keep watching the iron ore price; that will definitely influence sentiment in the near term." A slide in the iron ore spot price to an eight-month low of $US57.02 weighed on the resource giants; BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto were off 0.7 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively. Fortescue Metals was off 3.7 per cent. Dalian iron ore futures were down 3.8 per cent at 422 yuan ($US62) in late afternoon trade, pointing to a further drop in the spot price. There was mixed buying in the big four banks, though they all ultimately closed down, with Westpac's 0.7 per cent fall leading the way. Wesfarmers shares slumped 3.1 per cent to $41.37 after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock, warning the conglomerate's retail businesses are more exposed to Amazon than category killers JB Hi-Fi and Super Retail Group. Despite the gloom surrounding the retail sector thanks to disappointing consumer spending figures, a surprise uptick in retail sales saw the likes of JB Hi-Fi finish up 0.4 per cent while Myer jumped 2.3 per cent. 4:32pm on 1 Jun 2017 Major investors have put US industry on notice that climate change matters, even as reports emerged that President Donald Trump plans to withdraw the US from the Paris accord to fight global warming. A number of large institutional fund firms including BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, supported a shareholder resolution calling on ExxonMobil to share more information about how new technologies and climate change regulations could impact the business of the world's largest publicly traded oil company. The proposal won the support of 62.3 per cent of votes cast. The victory, on such a wide margin, was hailed by climate activists as a turning point in their decades-long campaign to get oil and gas companies to communicate how they would adapt to a low-carbon economy. With big investors now seeing climate change as a major risk, activists said US corporations will have to be more transparent about the impact of a warming planet even if the United States withdraws from the 2015 Paris climate accord, as Trump promised during his presidential campaign. "Economic forces are outrunning any other considerations," said Anne Simpson, investment director for sustainability at the California Public Employees' Retirement System, one of the sponsors of the resolution. She credited big investors in Exxon for the change, since at least some of them switched their votes after last year when a similar measure won just 38 per cent support. "We have seen a sea change in their viewpoint," she said. Many top investors now consider their votes on shareholder proposals "on merit, rather than considering it a test of loyalty to management," she said. Among Exxon's top investors, Vanguard Group and BlackRock opposed last year's call for climate change reporting. A spokeswoman for Vanguard, which has about 7 per cent of Exxon's shares, declined to comment on its voting this year. A person familiar with the matter said funds run by BlackRock, which holds about 6 per cent of Exxon shares, voted in favour of the climate resolution. The investment firms' approach reflects a new interest in climate matters among their own investors, who have stuffed money into so-called "green" mutual funds and other vehicles that use environmental factors in their stockpicking. 'Sea change in the viewpoint of big investors.' Photo: Michael Nagle 4:12pm on 1 Jun 2017 Cocoa prices have soared amid signs of tighter supplies in Ivory Coast, the world's top grower, raising prospects that chocolate costs will climb. July futures jumped as much as 6.8 per cent, the most ever for the contract. Farmers in West Africa are already locking in more forward sales for next year's crop than traders were expecting, a sign that supplies from the current harvest are beginning to ebb. The outlook for tighter supplies marks a shift for the market that's been suffering from a global surplus. The overhang pushed prices down 32 per cent over the past 12 months, helping to lower some retail costs for chocolate. The treats may not stay cheap for long, or at least that's what hedge funds are signalling. Money managers have backed away from their bearish cocoa bets for three straight weeks, US government data show. On ICE Futures US, cocoa for July delivery added 6.6 per cent to settle at $US2037 a metric ton on Tuesday in New York. Aggregate trading was about 70 per cent higher than the 100-day average for the time of day, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Prices are rebounding after reaching their lowest levels in almost 10 years in April. The end of cheap chocolate? Cocoa futures have soared the most on record. Photo: AP 3:35pm on 1 Jun 2017 In a particularly gloomy view of the economy, NAB is predicting the GDP shrunk in the first quarter and even sees a - slight - chance of a technical recession. If NAB is right, it would be the second contraction in three quarters, following the strong growth of 1.1 per cent in Q4 2016 and decline of 0.5 per cent in Q3 of 2016.  The year-ended rate of growth would slow to 1.3 per cent y/y, the weakest rate since the third quarter of 2009, during the GFC, the bank forecasts. Most economists are still predicting decent growth for next week's GDP numbers, with a recent Bloomberg survey pointing to a 0.6 per cent rise in first-quarter GDP. "While some of the contraction has undoubtedly been driven by the weather and other one-offs (as in Q3 last year), the question for next week will be whether the slowdown includes signal as well as noise, and implies a more fundamental economic slowdown," NAB chief economist Alan Oster writes in a note to clients. Oster is particularly worried about the slowdown in household consumption, which comes amid poor wages and household income growth. "Should this continue, it is unlikely that forecasts of 3 per cent and more growth from Treasury and the RBA will be met in the near term, particularly when LNG exports start to flatten off from 2018 (although it will support growth outcomes for the remainder of 2017)," he says. "The fall in dwelling construction this quarter suggests some risk that the dwelling construction cycle has peaked a little earlier than expected, although weather is also a likely factor and it's more likely to suggest a more elongated cycle." NAB's forecasts assume some further (modest) growth in 2017 before peaking in 2018.  Oster warns there is the small possibility of a negative GDP print in the second quarter - which would take Australia into technical recession - given the hit to coal exports from Cyclone Debbie, but he says there should be enough offset from LNG exports and government spending to keep GDP in the black.  Despite NAB's forecasts being considerably gloomier than the RBA's, Oster expects the central bank to remain on hold. NAB reckons the economy shrunk in the first quarter.  Back to top 2:53pm on 1 Jun 2017 One of the world's last havens for fund managers is coming under siege. In Australia's $2.8 trillion fund industry, managers who rely on human judgement to pick investments have so far withstood the global onslaught of passive offerings. They've done so in part by cutting fees below those in other large markets. The billions flowing in from the superannuation system have helped, too. It may not be enough. Giants like BlackRock and Vanguard, encouraged by the past years' global shift towards passive investments, are homing in on Australia with commissions active managers can't hope to match. And as beating benchmarks becomes harder, the industry is discovering that super funds' largesse has its limits. Against that backdrop, the chief investment officer of the $130 billion Future Fund has some advice for managers."They have to confront the new reality," Raphael Arndt said in a speech last month, urging them to take a "long hard look" at themselves. Arndt argued that what the "free kick" from rising asset prices was coming to an end and investors had become too sophisticated to pay a premium for benchmark-tracking returns.

The rapid contraction in the apartment market saw just 302 sales in the March quarter down 37 per cent on the previous quarter and well down from the 1032 sales in the previous corresponding period last year. The results reflect a range of problems including tighter and more expensive financing for both buyers and developers and taxes on foreign buyers. There are also suggestions of oversupply. Urbis associate director of property economics and research Paul Riga said that fewer sales were expected with the first quarter of the year traditionally lagging. "This quarter we saw some survey results which the market didn't anticipate, in addition to others we knew were coming," Riga said. He said that although sales had dropped away there had also been a reduction in supply. Some apartment projects in Brisbane are settling well despite an overall trend of fewer sales.  Photo: Supplied 1:38pm on 1 Jun 2017 A few economist reactions to today's surprisingly strong retail sales numbers and so-so capex data: Retail data overstates household health, says Paul Dales, Capital Economics: The private capital expenditure survey for the first quarter showed that mining investment is becoming a smaller drag on GDP growth, while the leap in retail sales in April overstates the health of households. There's no escaping the fact that the outlook for business investment remains weak. We estimate that GDP rose by just 0.2% q/q in the first quarter and that it will struggle to rise by 2.0% during this year as a whole. Citi's Josh Williamson thinks the retail surge is a one-off: We suspect these rises were partly from stronger Easter related trading. We don't look for a repeat in May though. Mortgage lending restrictions and higher mortgage interest rates point to some pressure on household goods retailing. We also point out that the very strong retail sales growth in QLD could partly be explained by households re-stocking food and some durable items following the floods that affected around 20,000 homes in late March. Q1 capex but the outlook is better, ANZ's Daniel Gradwell says: The fall in plant and equipment spending is a particularly soft result, and will weigh on next week's Q1 GDP data. Firms' expectations for 2017-18 suggest that the mining sector has further to fall, while the non-mining investment outlook eased but continues to suggest moderate growth is in store. Converting elevated levels of business conditions and confidence into investment activity remains a challenge. NAB's Tapas Strickland sees downside risks to Q1 GDP growth: The non-mining investment outlook for 2017/18 failed to lift further, while flat equipment investment in the quarter presents downside risks to Q1 GDP with the strong likelihood of a flat or slightly negative GDP outcome on June 7. The lack of a lift in the non-mining components of the survey will be discouraging for the RBA, which has been patiently awaiting a lift in non-mining investment intentions in the data. CBA's Gareth Aird sees some capex rise ahead: The soft business credit growth of late suggested that non‑mining investment intentions were unlikely to be upgraded in today's capex survey. The NAB Business Survey continues to suggest a lift in investment is forthcoming. But we think the softness in consumer demand is holding investment back. Fortunately there is a decent amount of public capex to come because the outlook for private investment remains weak.   1:18pm on 1 Jun 2017 Pimco has a message for investors: it's time to stop taking the markets for granted. Investors have become too complacent and monetary, fiscal, trade and geopolitical risks abound, Pimco's Richard Clarida, Andrew Balls and Dan Ivascyn said in a report issued overnight. There's a 70 per cent chance of a recession in the next five years, they said. "We believe that many market participants today are too relaxed, that medium-term risks are building and that investors should consider using cyclical rallies to build cash to deploy when markets eventually correct - and possibly overshoot - as risks are repriced," the executives said in Pimco's annual "Secular Outlook" for the next three to five years. Pimco's forecast is being issued as stock markets reach record highs, the US economic recovery enters its ninth year and Donald Trump's election has spurred optimism for pro-business reforms. "One thing that's happened is all asset classes are 10 or 15 per cent more expensive than they were a year ago," Clarida said. "So a lot of good news is already priced in." Downside risks for the economic outlook since last year include reduced prospects for China's growth rate, which may slow to 5.5 per cent from the current pace of 6.5 per cent, and the eurozone, which is likely to average 1.25 per cent over next five years, Pimco said. US growth is likely to continue at 2 per cent. Inflation will likely be 2 per cent on average and the Federal funds rate will be at 2 per cent to 3 per cent, they said. Of real concern for the global outlook is that policymakers are "driving without a spare tire" because of limited tools - caused by big balance sheets and low- or negative-interest rates - to deal with a recession. "Policy measures may not be sufficient to counter the next downturn, whenever it materialises," the report said. Central banks don't have much juice left to deal with the next downturn. Photo: Seth Wenig 12:44pm on 1 Jun 2017 NSW will double its foreign investors stamp duty surcharge to 8 per cent as part of a series of tax changes designed to make housing more affordable for Australian residents, according to the AFR. The annual land tax surcharge on foreign home owners will also increase to 2 per cent from the existing 0.75 per cent. The NSW government is also poised to widen access to its first-home buyers bonus, offering it to buyers of existing stock rather than just new homes. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian is expected to announce more details after a cabinet meeting today, the AFR reports. NSW hands down its budget on June 20. Berejiklian made improving housing affordability one of her top priorities when she came to office in January and appointed former Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens as an adviser on the package which cabinet is now considering.  NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says housing affordability is her top priority. Photo: Nick Moir Back to top 12:24pm on 1 Jun 2017 A few reactions (and charts) on Twitter to today's local data: Aus Apr retail sales +1%mom/3.1%yoy, driven by dept stores,food,cafe.

Along came some soft Chinese manufacturing numbers and the gains in the Aussie dollar faded as fast as they had accumulated, while shares have slipped back into the red. The private Caixin survey of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector fell to 49.6 in May, from 50.3 in April and below expectations of 50.1. It also slipped below the crucial 50 threshold, separating growth from contraction in the sector. The first contraction in the Caixin index in 11 months comes a day after official data showed a surprise strengthening in the sector. The Caixin report tends to focus on smaller firms which are not believed to be benefiting as much from a construction boom as large state-owned companies and industries such as steel mills. The divergence may suggest that much of China's recent economic strength remains strongly dependent on heavy industry and continued government stimulus, with other sectors facing more challenging business conditions. "China's manufacturing sector has come under greater pressure in May and the economy is clearly on a downward trajectory," Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the Caixin survey. 11:38am on 1 Jun 2017 Today's big economic data releases are out and there's no big disappointment for a change. Retail sales jumped 1 per cent in April, thanks to a 2.4 per cent jump in Queensland, and easily outpacing expectations of a 0.3 per cent overall rise, following March's soggy 0.2 per cent contraction. #Australia Retail Sales month-on-month at 1% https://t.co/WLlNlIwGAO pic.twitter.com/uOHcQGUKRw— Trading Economics (@tEconomics) June 1, 2017 And private investment spending actually rose for a change, albeit not quite as much as hoped for. First-quarter capex increased by 0.3 per cent - economists had tipped 0.5 per cent - following the previous quarter's 1 per cent contraction. The closely followed estimate for capex in the next financial year was lifted to $85.4 billion. That's up from the previous estimate of $80.6 billion - but still just half of the $166.8 billion invested at the peak of the mining boom in 2012-13. The Aussie dollar jumped about a quarter of a cent on the data, to the day's high of US74.47¢. Capital expenditure in the mining sector rose modestly in the March quarter - the first quarterly rise since the June quarter 2014 #ausbiz pic.twitter.com/ys5irKazEb— Callam Pickering (@CallamPickering) June 1, 2017 11:30am on 1 Jun 2017 China is dishing out a tough lesson to currency traders and strategists alike: don't bet against the yuan. The currency has jumped to its highest level in seven months offshore, soaring as much as 1.1 per cent yesterday alone, despite analyst forecasts for declines this quarter. And today, China's central bank set the yuan midpoint at 6.8090 per US dollar, lifting it 543 pips from the previous day's rate to its strongest level since November 10. The appreciation of the daily reference rate, a 0.8 percent move, was its biggest one-day strengthening since January. Surging interbank rates are squeezing bears by driving up the cost of short positions. The rally, which broke months of calm against the US dollar, came on the heels of an unwelcome credit-rating downgrade from Moody's. China made its displeasure clear, calling the move "absolutely groundless." The central bank had already been battling pessimistic traders by repeatedly strengthening the daily fixing, while an opaque change to the setting announced Friday added to the complexity of betting on future movements. "The Moody's downgrade and a weaker spot rate compared to the fixing could have spurred the authorities to change the fixing mechanism and potentially intervene in the market," said Jason Daw, head of emerging-market currency strategy at Societe Generale. The onshore yuan gained 0.6 percent to 6.8134 per dollar in Shanghai on Wednesday, after fluctuating in a narrow band around 6.9 for most of this year. The rate in Hong Kong extended its advance since Moody's rating change on May 24 to about 1.8 per cent. Analysts are scrambling to adjust to the shift. Credit Agricole scrapped a forecast of 7.25 per US dollar that's been in place since December, replacing it on Tuesday with a year-end level of 7.05. ANZ strengthened its end-2017 target to 6.95 from 7.10. Don't bet against the yuan. Photo: Ng Han Guan 11:08am on 1 Jun 2017  The Australian dollar is set to decline more than 6 per cent to around the "high 60s" level versus the greenback as the country loses its yield advantage over the US, according to Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Australia's interest-rate premium to the US will evaporate by the middle of next year as the Federal Reserve continues to tighten policy while the RBA keeps its benchmark at 1.5 per cent, said Philip Moffitt, Asia-Pacific head of fixed income at the investment manager. The Aussie has declined almost 3 per cent this quarter, underperforming its Group-of-10 peers. It's currently trading at US74.20¢. "One of the reasons why people buy Aussie dollars is it has been a relatively high yielder," said Moffitt. "That's changing. More exposure to China, no rate movement here and rate convergence with the US suggest the Aussie will go lower." The extra yield that Australia's 10-year bonds offer over similar-maturity Treasuries has dropped to just 18 basis points, near a 16-year low reached last week. The last time the gap was consistently that narrow was in 2001, when the Aussie touched its post-float low of US47.76¢.  But ANZ head of forex research Daniel Been noted that at the time the bursting of the internet bubble had led to a rush out of riskier assets, punishing the Aussie more than other currencies. "We do not think that the current narrowing in spreads can, in isolation, drive the AUD back below US70¢," Been said in a note to clients yesterday. "The evolution of global liquidity and the reaction of risk markets will be the key determinant," he said, tipping the Aussie will hold above US70¢. Still, hedge funds and other large speculators have unwound almost all of their bullish Aussie wagers, slashing them to the lowest since January, US Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Prices of iron ore have tumbled 27 per cent this year as concerns flare over the outlook for burgeoning global supply and a potential slowdown in demand in China, the largest user. The RBA is hamstrung. While it needs to support a weak jobs market, red-hot housing in Sydney and Melbourne constrains it from deploying its already limited rate ammunition. In the meantime, the Fed is set to raise rates at least two more times this year, Moffitt said. "It's quite likely that in 12 months Aussie short rates and US short rates could be basically the same level as the Fed tightens and the RBA does nothing," Moffitt said. "That's going to be a hard environment for the Aussie dollar to be strong." Goldman's Philip Moffitt reckons the Aussie will soon trade with a 60-s handle, but ANZ is more upbeat. Photo: Brendon Thorne Back to top 10:45am on 1 Jun 2017 Wesfarmers shares have slumped after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock, warning the conglomerate's retail businesses are more exposed to Amazon than category killers JB Hi-Fi and Super Retail Group. The broker predicted Wesfarmers could lose $400 million in earnings to the online behemoth by 2026. Morgan Stanley's retail team, led by Tom Kierath, says the market has failed to understand the impact of Amazon's arrival in Australia on Wesfarmers' discount department stores, Kmart and Target, which are likely to be harder hit by Amazon's low prices and speedy deliveries than specialist retailers. While shares in JB Hi-Fi and Super Retail Group have fallen 17 per cent and 26 per cent respectively this year because of the Amazon threat, Wesfarmers shares were up 1.3 per cent before this morning's selloff. Shares are currently down more than 4 per cent to $40.99. "We believe that Wesfarmers' department store businesses Kmart and Target are particularly susceptible as Amazon rolls out its first party product and its Prime offer," said Kierath. While Amazon is yet to release details of its Australian product range, pricing or its Prime offer, the investment bank believes it will be similar to that in other developed countries such as the US, UK and Italy, and that Amazon will generate sales of $12 billion in Australia by 2026. Morgan Stanley expects a soft launch by the end of 2017, local fulfillment starting during 2018, and the gradual rollout of products starting with physical media, electronics then apparel, with dry groceries, fresh food and auto parts taking longer. "Based on our estimates for Amazon share gains and incremental margins, we see Wesfarmers losing $400 million in EBIT by 2026 and have lowered our valuations for Kmart, Target and Bunnings," Kierath said. Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating on Wesfarmers to underweight from equal weight after cutting earnings per share forecasts by 1 per cent in 2017 to 10 per cent in 2020. The investment bank also slashed its share price target to $36 from $41, with a 'bear' case of $30. Morgan Stanley reckons the market is underestimating the impact of Amazon's arrival on Wesfarmers. Photo: Supplied 10:31am on 1 Jun 2017 The sharemarket is once again struggling for direction in early trade, disguising some bigger moves in individual stocks. The ASX has started the month flat, trading at 5724.3 as gains in utilities and healthcare are offset by losses in consumer staples and miners.  A further slide in oil prices underpinned concerns about valuations and the global outlook, traders said. The biggest drag on the benchmark index comes from Wesfarmers, which has plunged 3.1 per cent following a downgrade by Morgan Stanley. The big miners are also on the back foot after falls in major commodity prices overnight, which have pulled BHP down 1.1 per cent, Rio 1.7 per cent and Fortescue 3.4 per cent. The big banks are all trading slightly lower, while energy stocks are also under pressure. Rates-sensitive utilities and healthcare stocks are doing better, following a dip in global bond yields overnight. Transurban is continuing its rebound, rising 1.3 per cent and Sydney Airport is up 1.2 per cent.  Industrials are also mostly higher, led by a 2.8 per cent rise in Amcor and a 1.7 per cent gain in Brambles. 10:15am on 1 Jun 2017 House prices have fallen in Sydney and Melbourne but experts warn it is too early to call a housing downturn.  Over the month of May, Sydney house prices fell 1.3 per cent and Melbourne's prices dropped 1.7 per cent, according to Corelogic's latest Hedonic Home Value Index.  Hobart's prices also fell, by 4.8 per cent, but Brisbane prices were largely flat. All up, national house prices fell 1.1 per cent, driven mainly by the declines in Sydney and Melbourne, Corelogic said.  But more than a month's data was required to establish a fundamental shift towards a cooling, especially given past market performances in late 2015 and 2016, when prices dipped but rebounded much higher following a cash rate cut, experts said.   "I wouldn't be surprised if things bounce back," Corelogic head of research Tim Lawless said.  "When a market moves through a inflection point, there wil be some up's and down's. The trend is showing a slowing down, but the jury is still out on whether the market is moving through a peak." 9:57am on 1 Jun 2017 SPONSORED POST IG strategist Chris Weston is hoping that a new month will breathe new life into financial markets: We open the page on the month of June and I for one hope we can break this malaise in markets, with either an upside break or at least a reasonable pullback in global equities to attract new money and fresh life into the markets. There will be a reasonable amount of event risk to work through, not just with UK elections (8 June), with the ramifications of that event seemingly contained to UK assets, but key central bank meetings from the European Central Bank (also 8 June) and Federal Reserve (14 June). Locally, we get Q1 GDP (7 June) and that in itself will get a fair bit of attention and while we get a major contribution to that data point today with Q1 CAPEX, there are calls for the quarter to yield very subdued activity. Of course we will keep a focus on all things Trump too, and his approval rating given the USD's correlation with that and there has been some focus, not just on Trump reportedly making his decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord (Source: Axios), but there have been numerous reports that former FBI Director James Comey will testify next week, as early as Thursday. Either way, the stage has been set for Asia on the first day of the month is to start on a drab, yet somewhat negative start. We see oil price trading heavy, yet, once again buying support has kicked into the 17 May lows of $US48.35. This level clearly needs to hold and so far it is, and buyers have stepped in thanks to a huge 8.7 and 1.7 million draw respectively in the API private inventory report. In the short-term much will now hinge on tonight's (01:00 aest) Department of Energy weekly inventory report. We are also staring at real weakness in the bulk commodities too, with spot iron ore closing 2.5% lower at $57.02, while iron ore, steel and coking coal futures closed 3.2%, 2.4% and 2.9% lower respectively. Iron ore futures look like a short sellers dream right now and the technical set-up looks about as bearish as you will see. It's amazing to see BHP's American Depository Receipt only down 0.9%, although if you focus on Vale's US-listing (as a read through for the lines of AGO and FMG etc) it closed down 4.5%. Copper and gold seem like good places to be invested today, if in the commodity space. Here's more 9:47am on 1 Jun 2017 ANZ says its core equity tier one capital ratio will take a hit of 26 basis points, after the banking regulator completed a review of its risk weighting system. But with ANZ in a strong capital position after asset sales, the bank says this will not require any additional capital management action. Risk weightings are models that determine how much capital banks must set aside when lending, and there is a global move to make these weightings less generous to the largest lenders such as the big four. ANZ said APRA had finished its review of ANZ's model, and it would be using a risk weight of slightly over 28.5 per cent for its Australian home loan book. That effectively means ANZ can assume that when it lends out $100 to a home loan buyer, only $28.50 is at risk. This is separate from APRA's looming decision on what exactly is meant by "unquestionably strong," an official target for the banks set by the Financial System Inquiry, which could require banks to raise yet more capital. ANZ says it won't need to raise capital. Photo: Louise Kennerley Back to top Search pagination Current page Live Article Posts1 Next Live Article Posts2 Share via Email Post on facebook wall Share on Google Plus Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit 1 new post(s) available.

(AMD) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks 5 Top Stocks to Buy in June View All Posts Despite the rocky start to Wednesday’s action, the bulls managed to partially regroup today and close some of the gap. By the time the closing bell rang, the S&P 500 was well off its low of 2,403.59 to end the day at 2,411.80. That was only 0.05% lower than Wednesday’s close. Not every name was able to stage such a mid-day recovery, however. iRobot Corporation (NASDAQ:IRBT), Michael Kors Holdings Ltd (NYSE:KORS) and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) were all fighting losing battles. Here’s what investors need to know about each setback. Bank of America Corp (BAC) BAC wasn’t the banking sector’s biggest loser on Wednesday, rather JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) was; and JPMorgan was arguably the biggest reason behind the its downfall. BAC and JPM are regarded as interchangeable, and when one gets sick, it infects the other. The illness was trading revenue, or lack thereof. For the quarter-to-date, JPMorgan’s stock and bond trading activity is down 15% compared to where it was at this point in the same quarter a year earlier. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said at the very same industry conference that his company’s trading revenue was only down between 10% and 12% for the quarter so far, adding that the year-ago tally was an unusually high bar to use as a benchmark. Investors weren’t sympathetic though, sending JPM down to the tune of 2.1%, and sending BofA shares 1.9% lower. Michael Kors Holdings Ltd (KORS) As a not-so-gentle reminder that retailing continues to be a tough business, Michael Kors Holdings shares tumbled 8.5% today following a fiscal fourth-quarter report that topped expectations but was packaged with a dismal outlook. For the quarter ending in March, luxury apparel and accessory name turned $1.06 billion worth of revenue into a profit of 73 cents per share, beating expectations of $1.05 billion in sales and earnings of 70 cents per share of KORS. The company also said, however, it would be closing at least 100 of its stores to abate what was characterized by some as a “catastrophic” decline in sales. Revenue was down 11% for the quarter in question. GlobalData Retail’s CEO Neil Saunders commented: “In truth, ranges and collections lack oomph and definition, and across many established stores levels of service and merchandising are lackluster. In short, the brand is nowhere near where it needs to be if it wants to excite and inspire consumers.” iRobot Corporation (IRBT) Last but not least, robot manufacturer iRobot was downgraded today, pulling the rug out from underneath the stock. Don’t read too much into the analyst action though. It may have been more of a call to take some tidy profits than an assessment of the company’s future. Canaccord Genuity did the deed, lowering its stance on IRBT to a “Hold”, while simultaneously lowering its target price to $90. Of course, with the stock up nearly 70% since the end of 2016 and up by almost 160% over the course of the past twelve months, it’s tough to imagine there being much more upside left. That said, Canaccord is also worried about a lack of new game-changing robots in iRobot’s pipeline. By the time all the dust settled, IRBT shares were down 7.1%. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Bank stocks were hit by worries over trading revenues and the net interest margin pressure for a flattening yield curve. Energy names were pushed lower as crude oil weakened on reports of weakening compliance by OPEC nations in their recently extended output freeze agreement. Big names in both sectors are now at risk of significant downside support breaks, setting up further losses in the days to come. In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.1%, the S&P 500 lost 0.1%, the Nasdaq Composite gave back 0.1% and the Russell 2000 ended the day 0.1% lower. Treasury bonds climbed higher, the dollar was broadly weaker, gold gained 0.8% and oil fell 2.7%. Breadth was mixed to slightly negative, with 1.1 decliners to every advancer on the Nasdaq. NYSE volume was extremely heavy — suggestive of distribution, a negative sign — with 1,433 million shares traded representing 168% of the 30-day average in the most active day of trading since March 17. Defensive utility stocks led the way with a 0.5% gain while financials and energy were the laggards, down 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) fell 2.1% after its CFO said second-quarter market revenue was down about 15% from last year. Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) fell 1.9% after its CEO said Q2 trading revenue will be down on an annual basis. BAC, as shown above, is now testing critical “neckline” support of a massive six-month head-and-shoulders reversal pattern. The pattern is about as perfect as you’ll find in the wild. And it traces a downside target of $18.50, which would take the stock below its 200-day moving average to return it to levels not seen since early November — nearly completely reversing the post-election rally. Edge Pro subscribers are enjoying a 121% gain in their June $23 BAC puts recommended earlier this week. Aside from the warnings on trading revenue, the financial sector is at risk as Treasury bonds move higher (and thus, long-term yields move lower) as the post-election “Trump-flation” trade fades. This amid the worst disappointment in the economic data relative to expectations since 2015, underwhelming inflation data, and a sense the healthcare reform, tax cuts, and infrastructure spending plans Wall Street had eagerly priced in following President Trump’s surprise victory are going to be long in coming. As a result, the iShares 20+ Yr Treas.Bond (NYSEARCA:TLT) has pushed above its 200-day moving average for the first time since last October. That’s boosted the ProShares Ultra 20+Year Tsury ETF (NYSEARCA:UBT) recommended to Edge subscribers to a 4.5% gain. Conclusion The area of the market to watch right now is energy. Oil is under fresh pressure with West Texas Intermediate testing below the $47-a-barrel level. JBC Energy reported falling OPEC production cap compliance (down to 92% from 96% in April) as it’s clear the oil sheiks — despite agreeing to a nine-month extension of their output freeze deal — are increasingly desperate as U.S. shale producers lower their cost structures and boost rig counts. Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch wrote in a note to clients that there “continues to be considerable skepticism about the effectiveness of the production cuts” amid an ongoing global oversupply situation and swollen inventories. This is terrible news for energy stocks which have been in a persistent six-month downtrend. The Energy Select Sector SPDR (ETF) (NYSEARCA:XLE) is already down nearly 16% from its December high. Today’s losses push the sector down to levels not seen since last July. Shares of oil majors like Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) look extremely vulnerable here, readying a break out of multi-month consolidation ranges. Where this starts to matter to all investors is the bleed. Both bank and energy stocks are on the slide, and as a result, the broad market’s quiet strength – bolstered by overheated sentiment and parabolic rallies in big-tech stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) — is unlikely to continue. Especially as we enter what is seasonally the most difficult part of the year for the market. “Sell in May” and all that. Check out Serge Berger’s Trade of the Day for June 1, 2017.

Amazon will sting Wesfarmers more than investors realise, says Morgan Stanley In local data: retail sales get a Queensland boost, while Q1 capex doesn't shrink The Caixin manufacturing PMI drops below 50, contradicting official numbers Don't bet against the yuan: China's currency jumps after months of calm Live updates Sort posts by Newest Oldest 2:49pm on 1 Jun 2017 Here's an interesting chart to mull before we close the blog. Thanks for reading and posting comments - we'll be back tomorrow from 9am. 2:46pm on 1 Jun 2017 Shares see-sawed throughout the session before finishing in the black, after soft Chinese manufacturing data clashed with solid local retail sales growth. Investors bought up utilities and healthcare stocks, while Wesfarmers weighed on consumer staples and a dip in the oil price saw energy names sold off.  The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index and the broader All Ordinaries Index each finishing up 0.2 per cent to 5738.1 points and 5772.5 points respectively.  "There's nothing really strong giving investors conviction at the moment," said James Gerrish, senior investment adviser at Shaw & Partners.  "But investors are likely to keep watching the iron ore price; that will definitely influence sentiment in the near term." A slide in the iron ore spot price to an eight-month low of $US57.02 weighed on the resource giants; BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto were off 0.7 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively. Fortescue Metals was off 3.7 per cent. Dalian iron ore futures were down 3.8 per cent at 422 yuan ($US62) in late afternoon trade, pointing to a further drop in the spot price. There was mixed buying in the big four banks, though they all ultimately closed down, with Westpac's 0.7 per cent fall leading the way. Wesfarmers shares slumped 3.1 per cent to $41.37 after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock, warning the conglomerate's retail businesses are more exposed to Amazon than category killers JB Hi-Fi and Super Retail Group. Despite the gloom surrounding the retail sector thanks to disappointing consumer spending figures, a surprise uptick in retail sales saw the likes of JB Hi-Fi finish up 0.4 per cent while Myer jumped 2.3 per cent. 2:32pm on 1 Jun 2017 Major investors have put US industry on notice that climate change matters, even as reports emerged that President Donald Trump plans to withdraw the US from the Paris accord to fight global warming. A number of large institutional fund firms including BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, supported a shareholder resolution calling on ExxonMobil to share more information about how new technologies and climate change regulations could impact the business of the world's largest publicly traded oil company. The proposal won the support of 62.3 per cent of votes cast. The victory, on such a wide margin, was hailed by climate activists as a turning point in their decades-long campaign to get oil and gas companies to communicate how they would adapt to a low-carbon economy. With big investors now seeing climate change as a major risk, activists said US corporations will have to be more transparent about the impact of a warming planet even if the United States withdraws from the 2015 Paris climate accord, as Trump promised during his presidential campaign. "Economic forces are outrunning any other considerations," said Anne Simpson, investment director for sustainability at the California Public Employees' Retirement System, one of the sponsors of the resolution. She credited big investors in Exxon for the change, since at least some of them switched their votes after last year when a similar measure won just 38 per cent support. "We have seen a sea change in their viewpoint," she said. Many top investors now consider their votes on shareholder proposals "on merit, rather than considering it a test of loyalty to management," she said. Among Exxon's top investors, Vanguard Group and BlackRock opposed last year's call for climate change reporting. A spokeswoman for Vanguard, which has about 7 per cent of Exxon's shares, declined to comment on its voting this year. A person familiar with the matter said funds run by BlackRock, which holds about 6 per cent of Exxon shares, voted in favour of the climate resolution. The investment firms' approach reflects a new interest in climate matters among their own investors, who have stuffed money into so-called "green" mutual funds and other vehicles that use environmental factors in their stockpicking. 'Sea change in the viewpoint of big investors.' Photo: Michael Nagle 2:12pm on 1 Jun 2017 Cocoa prices have soared amid signs of tighter supplies in Ivory Coast, the world's top grower, raising prospects that chocolate costs will climb. July futures jumped as much as 6.8 per cent, the most ever for the contract. Farmers in West Africa are already locking in more forward sales for next year's crop than traders were expecting, a sign that supplies from the current harvest are beginning to ebb. The outlook for tighter supplies marks a shift for the market that's been suffering from a global surplus. The overhang pushed prices down 32 per cent over the past 12 months, helping to lower some retail costs for chocolate. The treats may not stay cheap for long, or at least that's what hedge funds are signalling. Money managers have backed away from their bearish cocoa bets for three straight weeks, US government data show. On ICE Futures US, cocoa for July delivery added 6.6 per cent to settle at $US2037 a metric ton on Tuesday in New York. Aggregate trading was about 70 per cent higher than the 100-day average for the time of day, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Prices are rebounding after reaching their lowest levels in almost 10 years in April. The end of cheap chocolate? Cocoa futures have soared the most on record. Photo: AP 1:35pm on 1 Jun 2017 In a particularly gloomy view of the economy, NAB is predicting the GDP shrunk in the first quarter and even sees a - slight - chance of a technical recession. If NAB is right, it would be the second contraction in three quarters, following the strong growth of 1.1 per cent in Q4 2016 and decline of 0.5 per cent in Q3 of 2016.  The year-ended rate of growth would slow to 1.3 per cent y/y, the weakest rate since the third quarter of 2009, during the GFC, the bank forecasts. Most economists are still predicting decent growth for next week's GDP numbers, with a recent Bloomberg survey pointing to a 0.6 per cent rise in first-quarter GDP. "While some of the contraction has undoubtedly been driven by the weather and other one-offs (as in Q3 last year), the question for next week will be whether the slowdown includes signal as well as noise, and implies a more fundamental economic slowdown," NAB chief economist Alan Oster writes in a note to clients. Oster is particularly worried about the slowdown in household consumption, which comes amid poor wages and household income growth. "Should this continue, it is unlikely that forecasts of 3 per cent and more growth from Treasury and the RBA will be met in the near term, particularly when LNG exports start to flatten off from 2018 (although it will support growth outcomes for the remainder of 2017)," he says. "The fall in dwelling construction this quarter suggests some risk that the dwelling construction cycle has peaked a little earlier than expected, although weather is also a likely factor and it's more likely to suggest a more elongated cycle." NAB's forecasts assume some further (modest) growth in 2017 before peaking in 2018.  Oster warns there is the small possibility of a negative GDP print in the second quarter - which would take Australia into technical recession - given the hit to coal exports from Cyclone Debbie, but he says there should be enough offset from LNG exports and government spending to keep GDP in the black.  Despite NAB's forecasts being considerably gloomier than the RBA's, Oster expects the central bank to remain on hold. NAB reckons the economy shrunk in the first quarter.  Back to top 12:53pm on 1 Jun 2017 One of the world's last havens for fund managers is coming under siege. In Australia's $2.8 trillion fund industry, managers who rely on human judgement to pick investments have so far withstood the global onslaught of passive offerings. They've done so in part by cutting fees below those in other large markets. The billions flowing in from the superannuation system have helped, too. It may not be enough. Giants like BlackRock and Vanguard, encouraged by the past years' global shift towards passive investments, are homing in on Australia with commissions active managers can't hope to match. And as beating benchmarks becomes harder, the industry is discovering that super funds' largesse has its limits. Against that backdrop, the chief investment officer of the $130 billion Future Fund has some advice for managers."They have to confront the new reality," Raphael Arndt said in a speech last month, urging them to take a "long hard look" at themselves. Arndt argued that what the "free kick" from rising asset prices was coming to an end and investors had become too sophisticated to pay a premium for benchmark-tracking returns. Here's more Are the good times ending for Aussie fundies?  Photo: Jessica Shapiro 12:20pm on 1 Jun 2017 New apartment sales in Brisbane have collapsed by more than 70 per cent in a year, according to analysts Urbis' latest market report. The rapid contraction in the apartment market saw just 302 sales in the March quarter down 37 per cent on the previous quarter and well down from the 1032 sales in the previous corresponding period last year. The results reflect a range of problems including tighter and more expensive financing for both buyers and developers and taxes on foreign buyers. There are also suggestions of oversupply. Urbis associate director of property economics and research Paul Riga said that fewer sales were expected with the first quarter of the year traditionally lagging. "This quarter we saw some survey results which the market didn't anticipate, in addition to others we knew were coming," Riga said. He said that although sales had dropped away there had also been a reduction in supply. Some apartment projects in Brisbane are settling well despite an overall trend of fewer sales.  Photo: Supplied 11:38am on 1 Jun 2017 A few economist reactions to today's surprisingly strong retail sales numbers and so-so capex data: Retail data overstates household health, says Paul Dales, Capital Economics: The private capital expenditure survey for the first quarter showed that mining investment is becoming a smaller drag on GDP growth, while the leap in retail sales in April overstates the health of households. There's no escaping the fact that the outlook for business investment remains weak. We estimate that GDP rose by just 0.2% q/q in the first quarter and that it will struggle to rise by 2.0% during this year as a whole. Citi's Josh Williamson thinks the retail surge is a one-off: We suspect these rises were partly from stronger Easter related trading. We don't look for a repeat in May though. Mortgage lending restrictions and higher mortgage interest rates point to some pressure on household goods retailing. We also point out that the very strong retail sales growth in QLD could partly be explained by households re-stocking food and some durable items following the floods that affected around 20,000 homes in late March. Q1 capex but the outlook is better, ANZ's Daniel Gradwell says: The fall in plant and equipment spending is a particularly soft result, and will weigh on next week's Q1 GDP data. Firms' expectations for 2017-18 suggest that the mining sector has further to fall, while the non-mining investment outlook eased but continues to suggest moderate growth is in store. Converting elevated levels of business conditions and confidence into investment activity remains a challenge. NAB's Tapas Strickland sees downside risks to Q1 GDP growth: The non-mining investment outlook for 2017/18 failed to lift further, while flat equipment investment in the quarter presents downside risks to Q1 GDP with the strong likelihood of a flat or slightly negative GDP outcome on June 7. The lack of a lift in the non-mining components of the survey will be discouraging for the RBA, which has been patiently awaiting a lift in non-mining investment intentions in the data. CBA's Gareth Aird sees some capex rise ahead: The soft business credit growth of late suggested that non‑mining investment intentions were unlikely to be upgraded in today's capex survey. The NAB Business Survey continues to suggest a lift in investment is forthcoming. But we think the softness in consumer demand is holding investment back. Fortunately there is a decent amount of public capex to come because the outlook for private investment remains weak.   11:18am on 1 Jun 2017 Pimco has a message for investors: it's time to stop taking the markets for granted. Investors have become too complacent and monetary, fiscal, trade and geopolitical risks abound, Pimco's Richard Clarida, Andrew Balls and Dan Ivascyn said in a report issued overnight. There's a 70 per cent chance of a recession in the next five years, they said. "We believe that many market participants today are too relaxed, that medium-term risks are building and that investors should consider using cyclical rallies to build cash to deploy when markets eventually correct - and possibly overshoot - as risks are repriced," the executives said in Pimco's annual "Secular Outlook" for the next three to five years. Pimco's forecast is being issued as stock markets reach record highs, the US economic recovery enters its ninth year and Donald Trump's election has spurred optimism for pro-business reforms. "One thing that's happened is all asset classes are 10 or 15 per cent more expensive than they were a year ago," Clarida said. "So a lot of good news is already priced in." Downside risks for the economic outlook since last year include reduced prospects for China's growth rate, which may slow to 5.5 per cent from the current pace of 6.5 per cent, and the eurozone, which is likely to average 1.25 per cent over next five years, Pimco said. US growth is likely to continue at 2 per cent. Inflation will likely be 2 per cent on average and the Federal funds rate will be at 2 per cent to 3 per cent, they said. Of real concern for the global outlook is that policymakers are "driving without a spare tire" because of limited tools - caused by big balance sheets and low- or negative-interest rates - to deal with a recession. "Policy measures may not be sufficient to counter the next downturn, whenever it materialises," the report said. Central banks don't have much juice left to deal with the next downturn. Photo: Seth Wenig 10:44am on 1 Jun 2017 NSW will double its foreign investors stamp duty surcharge to 8 per cent as part of a series of tax changes designed to make housing more affordable for Australian residents, according to the AFR. The annual land tax surcharge on foreign home owners will also increase to 2 per cent from the existing 0.75 per cent. The NSW government is also poised to widen access to its first-home buyers bonus, offering it to buyers of existing stock rather than just new homes. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian is expected to announce more details after a cabinet meeting today, the AFR reports. NSW hands down its budget on June 20. Berejiklian made improving housing affordability one of her top priorities when she came to office in January and appointed former Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens as an adviser on the package which cabinet is now considering.  NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says housing affordability is her top priority. Photo: Nick Moir Back to top 10:24am on 1 Jun 2017 A few reactions (and charts) on Twitter to today's local data: Aus Apr retail sales +1%mom/3.1%yoy, driven by dept stores,food,cafe.

Along came some soft Chinese manufacturing numbers and the gains in the Aussie dollar faded as fast as they had accumulated, while shares have slipped back into the red. The private Caixin survey of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector fell to 49.6 in May, from 50.3 in April and below expectations of 50.1. It also slipped below the crucial 50 threshold, separating growth from contraction in the sector. The first contraction in the Caixin index in 11 months comes a day after official data showed a surprise strengthening in the sector. The Caixin report tends to focus on smaller firms which are not believed to be benefiting as much from a construction boom as large state-owned companies and industries such as steel mills. The divergence may suggest that much of China's recent economic strength remains strongly dependent on heavy industry and continued government stimulus, with other sectors facing more challenging business conditions. "China's manufacturing sector has come under greater pressure in May and the economy is clearly on a downward trajectory," Zhengsheng Zhong, director of macroeconomic analysis at CEBM Group, said in a note accompanying the Caixin survey. 9:38am on 1 Jun 2017 Today's big economic data releases are out and there's no big disappointment for a change. Retail sales jumped 1 per cent in April, thanks to a 2.4 per cent jump in Queensland, and easily outpacing expectations of a 0.3 per cent overall rise, following March's soggy 0.2 per cent contraction. #Australia Retail Sales month-on-month at 1% https://t.co/WLlNlIwGAO pic.twitter.com/uOHcQGUKRw— Trading Economics (@tEconomics) June 1, 2017 And private investment spending actually rose for a change, albeit not quite as much as hoped for. First-quarter capex increased by 0.3 per cent - economists had tipped 0.5 per cent - following the previous quarter's 1 per cent contraction. The closely followed estimate for capex in the next financial year was lifted to $85.4 billion. That's up from the previous estimate of $80.6 billion - but still just half of the $166.8 billion invested at the peak of the mining boom in 2012-13. The Aussie dollar jumped about a quarter of a cent on the data, to the day's high of US74.47¢. Capital expenditure in the mining sector rose modestly in the March quarter - the first quarterly rise since the June quarter 2014 #ausbiz pic.twitter.com/ys5irKazEb— Callam Pickering (@CallamPickering) June 1, 2017 9:30am on 1 Jun 2017 China is dishing out a tough lesson to currency traders and strategists alike: don't bet against the yuan. The currency has jumped to its highest level in seven months offshore, soaring as much as 1.1 per cent yesterday alone, despite analyst forecasts for declines this quarter. And today, China's central bank set the yuan midpoint at 6.8090 per US dollar, lifting it 543 pips from the previous day's rate to its strongest level since November 10. The appreciation of the daily reference rate, a 0.8 percent move, was its biggest one-day strengthening since January. Surging interbank rates are squeezing bears by driving up the cost of short positions. The rally, which broke months of calm against the US dollar, came on the heels of an unwelcome credit-rating downgrade from Moody's. China made its displeasure clear, calling the move "absolutely groundless." The central bank had already been battling pessimistic traders by repeatedly strengthening the daily fixing, while an opaque change to the setting announced Friday added to the complexity of betting on future movements. "The Moody's downgrade and a weaker spot rate compared to the fixing could have spurred the authorities to change the fixing mechanism and potentially intervene in the market," said Jason Daw, head of emerging-market currency strategy at Societe Generale. The onshore yuan gained 0.6 percent to 6.8134 per dollar in Shanghai on Wednesday, after fluctuating in a narrow band around 6.9 for most of this year. The rate in Hong Kong extended its advance since Moody's rating change on May 24 to about 1.8 per cent. Analysts are scrambling to adjust to the shift. Credit Agricole scrapped a forecast of 7.25 per US dollar that's been in place since December, replacing it on Tuesday with a year-end level of 7.05. ANZ strengthened its end-2017 target to 6.95 from 7.10. Don't bet against the yuan. Photo: Ng Han Guan 9:08am on 1 Jun 2017  The Australian dollar is set to decline more than 6 per cent to around the "high 60s" level versus the greenback as the country loses its yield advantage over the US, according to Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Australia's interest-rate premium to the US will evaporate by the middle of next year as the Federal Reserve continues to tighten policy while the RBA keeps its benchmark at 1.5 per cent, said Philip Moffitt, Asia-Pacific head of fixed income at the investment manager. The Aussie has declined almost 3 per cent this quarter, underperforming its Group-of-10 peers. It's currently trading at US74.20¢. "One of the reasons why people buy Aussie dollars is it has been a relatively high yielder," said Moffitt. "That's changing. More exposure to China, no rate movement here and rate convergence with the US suggest the Aussie will go lower." The extra yield that Australia's 10-year bonds offer over similar-maturity Treasuries has dropped to just 18 basis points, near a 16-year low reached last week. The last time the gap was consistently that narrow was in 2001, when the Aussie touched its post-float low of US47.76¢.  But ANZ head of forex research Daniel Been noted that at the time the bursting of the internet bubble had led to a rush out of riskier assets, punishing the Aussie more than other currencies. "We do not think that the current narrowing in spreads can, in isolation, drive the AUD back below US70¢," Been said in a note to clients yesterday. "The evolution of global liquidity and the reaction of risk markets will be the key determinant," he said, tipping the Aussie will hold above US70¢. Still, hedge funds and other large speculators have unwound almost all of their bullish Aussie wagers, slashing them to the lowest since January, US Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Prices of iron ore have tumbled 27 per cent this year as concerns flare over the outlook for burgeoning global supply and a potential slowdown in demand in China, the largest user. The RBA is hamstrung. While it needs to support a weak jobs market, red-hot housing in Sydney and Melbourne constrains it from deploying its already limited rate ammunition. In the meantime, the Fed is set to raise rates at least two more times this year, Moffitt said. "It's quite likely that in 12 months Aussie short rates and US short rates could be basically the same level as the Fed tightens and the RBA does nothing," Moffitt said. "That's going to be a hard environment for the Aussie dollar to be strong." Goldman's Philip Moffitt reckons the Aussie will soon trade with a 60-s handle, but ANZ is more upbeat. Photo: Brendon Thorne Back to top 8:45am on 1 Jun 2017 Wesfarmers shares have slumped after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock, warning the conglomerate's retail businesses are more exposed to Amazon than category killers JB Hi-Fi and Super Retail Group. The broker predicted Wesfarmers could lose $400 million in earnings to the online behemoth by 2026. Morgan Stanley's retail team, led by Tom Kierath, says the market has failed to understand the impact of Amazon's arrival in Australia on Wesfarmers' discount department stores, Kmart and Target, which are likely to be harder hit by Amazon's low prices and speedy deliveries than specialist retailers. While shares in JB Hi-Fi and Super Retail Group have fallen 17 per cent and 26 per cent respectively this year because of the Amazon threat, Wesfarmers shares were up 1.3 per cent before this morning's selloff. Shares are currently down more than 4 per cent to $40.99. "We believe that Wesfarmers' department store businesses Kmart and Target are particularly susceptible as Amazon rolls out its first party product and its Prime offer," said Kierath. While Amazon is yet to release details of its Australian product range, pricing or its Prime offer, the investment bank believes it will be similar to that in other developed countries such as the US, UK and Italy, and that Amazon will generate sales of $12 billion in Australia by 2026. Morgan Stanley expects a soft launch by the end of 2017, local fulfillment starting during 2018, and the gradual rollout of products starting with physical media, electronics then apparel, with dry groceries, fresh food and auto parts taking longer. "Based on our estimates for Amazon share gains and incremental margins, we see Wesfarmers losing $400 million in EBIT by 2026 and have lowered our valuations for Kmart, Target and Bunnings," Kierath said. Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating on Wesfarmers to underweight from equal weight after cutting earnings per share forecasts by 1 per cent in 2017 to 10 per cent in 2020. The investment bank also slashed its share price target to $36 from $41, with a 'bear' case of $30. Morgan Stanley reckons the market is underestimating the impact of Amazon's arrival on Wesfarmers. Photo: Supplied 8:31am on 1 Jun 2017 The sharemarket is once again struggling for direction in early trade, disguising some bigger moves in individual stocks. The ASX has started the month flat, trading at 5724.3 as gains in utilities and healthcare are offset by losses in consumer staples and miners.  A further slide in oil prices underpinned concerns about valuations and the global outlook, traders said. The biggest drag on the benchmark index comes from Wesfarmers, which has plunged 3.1 per cent following a downgrade by Morgan Stanley. The big miners are also on the back foot after falls in major commodity prices overnight, which have pulled BHP down 1.1 per cent, Rio 1.7 per cent and Fortescue 3.4 per cent. The big banks are all trading slightly lower, while energy stocks are also under pressure. Rates-sensitive utilities and healthcare stocks are doing better, following a dip in global bond yields overnight. Transurban is continuing its rebound, rising 1.3 per cent and Sydney Airport is up 1.2 per cent.  Industrials are also mostly higher, led by a 2.8 per cent rise in Amcor and a 1.7 per cent gain in Brambles. 8:15am on 1 Jun 2017 House prices have fallen in Sydney and Melbourne but experts warn it is too early to call a housing downturn.  Over the month of May, Sydney house prices fell 1.3 per cent and Melbourne's prices dropped 1.7 per cent, according to Corelogic's latest Hedonic Home Value Index.  Hobart's prices also fell, by 4.8 per cent, but Brisbane prices were largely flat. All up, national house prices fell 1.1 per cent, driven mainly by the declines in Sydney and Melbourne, Corelogic said.  But more than a month's data was required to establish a fundamental shift towards a cooling, especially given past market performances in late 2015 and 2016, when prices dipped but rebounded much higher following a cash rate cut, experts said.   "I wouldn't be surprised if things bounce back," Corelogic head of research Tim Lawless said.  "When a market moves through a inflection point, there wil be some up's and down's. The trend is showing a slowing down, but the jury is still out on whether the market is moving through a peak." 7:57am on 1 Jun 2017 SPONSORED POST IG strategist Chris Weston is hoping that a new month will breathe new life into financial markets: We open the page on the month of June and I for one hope we can break this malaise in markets, with either an upside break or at least a reasonable pullback in global equities to attract new money and fresh life into the markets. There will be a reasonable amount of event risk to work through, not just with UK elections (8 June), with the ramifications of that event seemingly contained to UK assets, but key central bank meetings from the European Central Bank (also 8 June) and Federal Reserve (14 June). Locally, we get Q1 GDP (7 June) and that in itself will get a fair bit of attention and while we get a major contribution to that data point today with Q1 CAPEX, there are calls for the quarter to yield very subdued activity. Of course we will keep a focus on all things Trump too, and his approval rating given the USD's correlation with that and there has been some focus, not just on Trump reportedly making his decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord (Source: Axios), but there have been numerous reports that former FBI Director James Comey will testify next week, as early as Thursday. Either way, the stage has been set for Asia on the first day of the month is to start on a drab, yet somewhat negative start. We see oil price trading heavy, yet, once again buying support has kicked into the 17 May lows of $US48.35. This level clearly needs to hold and so far it is, and buyers have stepped in thanks to a huge 8.7 and 1.7 million draw respectively in the API private inventory report. In the short-term much will now hinge on tonight's (01:00 aest) Department of Energy weekly inventory report. We are also staring at real weakness in the bulk commodities too, with spot iron ore closing 2.5% lower at $57.02, while iron ore, steel and coking coal futures closed 3.2%, 2.4% and 2.9% lower respectively. Iron ore futures look like a short sellers dream right now and the technical set-up looks about as bearish as you will see. It's amazing to see BHP's American Depository Receipt only down 0.9%, although if you focus on Vale's US-listing (as a read through for the lines of AGO and FMG etc) it closed down 4.5%. Copper and gold seem like good places to be invested today, if in the commodity space. Here's more 7:47am on 1 Jun 2017 ANZ says its core equity tier one capital ratio will take a hit of 26 basis points, after the banking regulator completed a review of its risk weighting system. But with ANZ in a strong capital position after asset sales, the bank says this will not require any additional capital management action. Risk weightings are models that determine how much capital banks must set aside when lending, and there is a global move to make these weightings less generous to the largest lenders such as the big four. ANZ said APRA had finished its review of ANZ's model, and it would be using a risk weight of slightly over 28.5 per cent for its Australian home loan book. That effectively means ANZ can assume that when it lends out $100 to a home loan buyer, only $28.50 is at risk. This is separate from APRA's looming decision on what exactly is meant by "unquestionably strong," an official target for the banks set by the Financial System Inquiry, which could require banks to raise yet more capital. ANZ says it won't need to raise capital. Photo: Louise Kennerley Back to top Search pagination Current page Live Article Posts1 Next Live Article Posts2 Share via Email Post on facebook wall Share on Google Plus Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit 1 new post(s) available.

Markets largely ignored the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate pact. The S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at all-time highs. Banks rebounded from a selloff as the 10-year Treasury yield pushed higher. European equities halted a five-day slide. The dollar strengthened as companies added more workers to U.S. payrolls in May than forecast. West Texas oil erased gains in afternoon trading. Robert Kaplan speaks with Bloomberg’s Tom Keene. Source: Bloomberg Banks led the biggest gain for U.S. stocks in almost two weeks, as a slew of data pointed to an economy of firm footing. With the Federal Reserve meeting in two weeks, eyes will turn Friday to the latest hiring report. At the same time, political intrigue in Washington remained a market theme, with former FBI Director James Comey slated to testify to lawmakers June 8, the same day as the U.K. election. Read our Markets Live blog here. Here are some of the key upcoming events: The U.S. jobs report Friday may bolster the case for a rate hike, with a gain of 180,000 positions expected. Here are the main moves in markets: Stocks The S&P 500 rose 0.8 percent to a record 2,430 at 4 p.m. in New York. The Nasdaq Composite and Nasdaq 100 indexes each advanced to fresh records. The Russell 2000 Index jumped 1.9 percent after lagging behind other major equity gauges last month. The small cap index climbed the most since March 1. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index advanced 0.4 percent, after finishing May with a 0.8 percent increase. Real-estate and media shares led gains Thursday. MSCI’s emerging-market index rose 0.4 percent after climbing for a fifth straight month in May. Currencies The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose 0.2 percent, following a 1.5 percent decline in May for the biggest monthly drop since January. It would be the first gain of the week, bolstered by a private payrolls survey The pound fell 0.1 percent to $1.2883. The euro weakened 0.3 percent to $1.1216. The yen slipped 0.6 percent to 111.396 per dollar, after gaining in the month of May. Commodities West Texas Intermediate crude oil fell 0.4 percent to $48.15 to a two-week low. Crude initially rose above $49 a barrel after government data showed a drop in inventories. Crude fell 2.7 percent in the previous session. Gold dropped 0.4 percent to $1,263.98 an ounce, giving back some of Wednesday’s 0.5 percent gain.  Nickel posts lowest close since June 2016 as contraction in private gauge of China’s manufacturing compounds concerns about oversupply following a resumption in nickel ore exports from Indonesia. Bonds The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose one basis point to 2.21 percent. The yield curve initially flattened after the ADP report, with the spread between five-year and 30-year notes breaching 110 basis points for the first time since May 11, before it steepened again. Illinois had its bond rating downgraded to one step above junk by S&P Global Ratings, the lowest grade that it’s given to a U.S. state on record, as a long-running political stalemate over a budget shows no signs of ending.

Banks fell hard as executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 1.11 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65.

Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.34, or 2.7 percent, to $48.32 a barrel in New York. INSURANCE Aetna in talks to shift HQ from Connecticut Aetna announced Wednesday that it is in negotiations to move its headquarters out of Hartford, Connecticut’s capital, where it has been based for almost two centuries. Mark Bertolini, the chief executive of the insurance giant, said Wednesday that the company is in negotiations with several states about moving its corporate base, with the goal of broadening access to innovation and talent that will fill “knowledge economy-type” positions. Aetna, the nation’s third largest health insurer, has a workforce of almost 50,000 and employs about 6,000 people in Connecticut. FOOD AND DRINK McDonald’s expands delivery locations McDonald’s CEO said Wednesday that the number of McDonald’s restaurants available to deliver Big Macs, Chicken McNuggets and fries is expanding by another 1,000 this week, bringing the total to more than 2,000. New locations include the New York metro area, Seattle, Denver and more. CEO Steve Easterbrook said McDonald’s will have 3,500 restaurants on the UberEats app by the end of June. Easterbrook said McDonald’s was encouraged by early delivery results, particularly with younger customers with late-night appetites.

Baker Stitch Fix Inc has hired investment banks for an initial public offering (IPO) that could value the U.S. personalized fashion internet retailer at between $3 billion and $4 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter. The IPO would be the first by a U.S. e-commerce company in two years, as stock market investors have been wary of betting on companies in the sector that, unlike Stitch Fix, are not already profitable. San Francisco-based Stitch Fix has hired investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to lead the IPO, four people said this week, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Stitch Fix, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment. Founded in 2011 by Harvard Business School graduate Katrina Lake, Stitch Fix has over 5,700 employees. It had $730 million in sales in its fiscal year for 2016, its third year of profitability. Stitch Fix sends its customers five personalized apparel and accessories items based on size, budget and style. Customers fill out a survey of their preferences, which the company then uses to select items for them with the aid of a personal stylist. Customers can return what they do not like in the company's prepaid packaging. Stitch Fix works with more than 250 women's fashion brands, including Joie and Citizens for Humanity, and more than 30 men's brands including Scotch & Soda. Stitch Fix is a variant on the popular e-commerce "subscription box" model, in which customers pay to have regular - often monthly - shipments of goods. Stitch Fix offers subscriptions, but does not require customers to subscribe to use their service. Subscription businesses such as cosmetics supplier Birchbox and athleisure brand Fabletics have proliferated in recent years, offering retailers more predictable revenue streams, albeit at the expense of putting off some customers who do not like the commitment of a subscription. The reach of subscription businesses has attracted corporate acquirers in recent years. Subscription shave business Dollar Shave Club, for example, agreed last year to be sold to consumer goods company Unilever Plc (ULVR.L) for $1 billion.

ELLIOTT 5/31/2017 Reprints XAutoplay: On | Off The market ended May with a dull thud, running losses of 0.1% across the Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average. It was the Nasdaq's seventh straight monthly advance, ending up 2.4% for May. The S&P 500 managed a 1.1% gain, while the Dow industrials eked out only the thinnest of fractional advances. Data played a key role in Wednesday's action, with the Dow industrials, Nasdaq and S&P 500 opening higher, then reversing sharply after the release of the Chicago Purchasing Manager Index for May at 9:45 a.m. ET, although a corrected version of the PMI showed a much stronger report. The first release of the Chicago PMI showed a reading of 55.2, down hard from the prior month's 58.3 tally and below the consensus view for 57.5. The corrected version showed a May reading of 59.4, its highest mark in 2-1/2 years and well above forecasts. Overnight data out of China showed better-than-expected manufacturing growth in May, but the steel, equipment and mining stocks that would normally react positively to such news came under pressure early in the session. In addition, claims from Libya that production had recovered to above its long-term ceiling of 800,900 barrels helped send crude prices down almost 3%, to $48.32 a barrel, leaving it down 2% for the month. Stocks fell, then gradually regained ground after the release of the Federal Reserve's May Beige Book, which showed continued modest growth, but increasing signs that optimism could be flagging. The report was closely watched because it's the last Beige Book report ahead of the Fed's meeting on interest rates in June, when a majority of investors expect another increase in rates. Pfizer (PFE) led the Dow industrials, up 1.6% after announcing that both the Food & Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency had accepted its submissions to expand the approved use of Sutent to include treatment for recurrent renal cell carcinoma in patients following kidney surgery. Pfizer shares are working on their first weekly advance since late April. Pressure on the S&P 500 came from Michael Kors (KORS), Tenet Healthcare (THC), Southwestern Energy (SWN) and Goldman Sachs (GS). Goldman and JPMorgan (JPM) drove the downside among Dow stocks.  Goldman tumbled 3% and JPMorgan 2% following the revelation by JPMorgan's CFO Marianne Lake, speaking at an investor conference, that the firm's trading revenue was down 15% year over year. Losses were more subdued on the Nasdaq, with O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY) and Baidu (BIDU) hardest hit, down 2% apiece. At the top of the Nasdaq 100, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) rose 2.7%, taking a new high. Analog Devices (ADI) thrashed 7% higher at the open, then backtracked to close 1% higher in big trade. The Norwood, Mass.-company reported a big fiscal Q2 earnings win and delivered Q3 revenue and earnings guidance above analyst expectations. Shares ended in a buy range from an 84.34 buy point in a flat base. IBD 50 stock Control4 (CTRL) roared 8% higher in big trade. Needham upgraded the connected-home software developer to buy, with a 22 price target. The stock is extended after an April rebound from the 10-week moving average. Drugmaker Perrigo (PRGO) led the S&P 500, up 6% after a strong first-quarter report. But the stock remains deep in a 26-month consolidation.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    As Donald Trump nears a final decision on the Paris climate agreement, top corporate executives are mounting a last-minute push aimed at persuading the president that the U.S. has more to lose from abandoning the accord. The appeals from chief executives such as Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk, Tim Cook of Apple Inc. and Dow Chemical Co.’s Andrew Liveris come as Trump’s advisers also present him with closing arguments on the potential risks and rewards of remaining a party to the global pact. Trump also got an earful from foreign leaders and Pope Francis urging him to stay in the agreement during his first international trip as president. Cook placed a call to the White House on Tuesday to urge the president to keep the U.S. in the agreement, according to a person familiar with the move. Liveris was the driving force behind a letter from 30 major company executives backing the deal. And Musk tweeted Wednesday that he has “done all I can to advise directly to" Trump. If the U.S. leaves Paris, Musk said he would drop participation in White House advisory councils. Corporate leaders "are continuing to try to get through to the White House in any and every way they can," said Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, the non-profit sustainability advocacy that works with investors. They "are particularly important stakeholders for this president," she said. More on Trump’s Difficult Choice on Paris Climate Accord: QuickTake Q&A The executives are trying to capitalize on Trump’s "America first" ideology by warning that a withdrawal would put the U.S. at a disadvantage in a global race to develop and deploy clean-energy technology, potentially ceding that market opportunity to China, the world’s top emitter of greenhouse gas emissions. A television advertisement that began running Wednesday cites 10 of "America’s biggest CEOs," including JP Morgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon and General Electric Co.’s Jeffrey Immelt, as backing the climate pact "because it will benefit American manufacturing and generate jobs." Trump tweeted Wednesday that he would announce his decision on the Paris accord "over the next few days." While Trump is leaning toward exiting the pact, according to people familiar with the White House deliberations, the situation remained fluid amid intense last-minute lobbying. The people requested anonymity because Trump’s decision has not yet been officially announced. The president’s verdict will be driven by "what’s best for the United States," said Gary Cohn, his top economic adviser, during Trump’s recent trip abroad.  Read More: Trump Said to Still Be Mulling Whether to Leave Paris Accord Twenty-five companies, including Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp. and PG&E Corp., have signed on to a letter set to run as a full-page advertisement in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal on Thursday arguing in favor of climate pact. "By expanding markets for innovative clean technologies, the agreement generates jobs and economic growth," the open letter says. "U.S. companies are well positioned to lead in these markets. Withdrawing from the agreement will limit our access to them and could expose us to retaliatory measures." Some companies that favor continued U.S. involvement in the deal stand to benefit directly from greater worldwide demand for lower-emission technology and energy sources, such as natural gas and renewable power. For instance, natural gas producers Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc have endorsed the pact, as has Cheniere Energy Inc., which exports liquefied natural gas. Campaign Issue Not all corporations are in line on the Paris agreement. Some coal producers, including Murray Energy Corp., vociferously oppose the pact. Robert E. Murray, the founder and chief executive officer of the mining company, told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday that Trump has a responsibility to fulfill his campaign pledges and jettison the agreement. The president should "listen to those who voted for him," Murray said. Others warn that U.S. companies could face repercussions globally, including consumer-driven boycotts of their products. “The business community has spoken with a loud and clear voice that if the decision is to leave Paris it not in line with the thinking of the vast majority of mainstream business in the United States," said David Stearns, communications director for The B Team, a group of corporate leaders urging sustainable practices. "If you look at every sector -- financial, banking, major employers, high-tech, oil and gas, coal companies -- they’ve all been saying that staying in Paris makes sense from a number of perspectives." © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

The largest Wall Street banks have tumbled in New York trading this week as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) disclosed double-digit declines in their trading businesses during April and May, which may pressure second-quarter earnings. The drop is largely because of a difficult comparison to a year ago, when Great Britain shocked markets by deciding to pull out of the European Union, a move that fueled a fixed-income trading boom. In the three months through June 2016, such trades climbed 35% at JPMorgan, 26% at Bank of America, 20% at Goldman Sachs (GS) and 14% at Citigroup (C) . A subsequent drop in the pound's exchange rate coupled with real estate mogul Donald Trump's surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election and two rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to sustain a surge in fixed-income trading that lasted nine months before fading. "There's not a lot to trade around right now," JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake said at a Deutsche Bank conference in New York on Wednesday. "There aren't a lot of market themes, and there haven't been many idiosyncratic events. We need a few more of them." The New York-based bank's markets businesses, which include stock trading as well as fixed-income transactions, have fallen about 15% from the same period a year ago, Lake said.  "We did quite well in 2016," she added. "That's a high bar. We will work hard very hour of every day to replicate or beat it, but it is a high bar." Bank of America, based in Charlotte, N.C., has seen similar trends, CEO Brian Moynihan said at a separate conference. Its trading businesses declined 10% to 12% in April and May. At Goldman Sachs, client trades related to volatility were subdued in the three months through March, a trend that has continued through the second quarter, said David Solomon, the former investment banking executive recently promoted to co-COO. "There are obviously four more weeks left to go," Solomon told analysts at the Deutsche conference, declining to provide more detail. "You know and we know this stuff can ebb and flow."  JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon. The declines prompted Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck to cut earnings-per-share estimates at the biggest Wall Street banks by as much as 9%, according to a note Thursday. At Thursday's close, Goldman had tumbled 3.8% for the week; JPMorgan had dropped 2.7%, Bank of America had dipped 2.6%; Citi had fallen 1.6% and Morgan Stanley had slipped 0.5%.  The quarter's slower trading volumes build on developments in March, when Morgan Stanley CFO Jonathan Pruzan said questions about the "timing and achievability" of the Trump administration's policy goals, such as curbing post-financial crisis regulations and cutting taxes resulted in "more sporadic client activity,"  On March 24, Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan pulled a bill repealing Obamacare -- which they had described as a necessary precursor to tax reductions -- after they were unable to convince enough members of their own party to support it. A revised bill later passed the House, but lacks backing in the Senate because of changes that would cut health coverage for elderly taxpayers. Meanwhile, heightened scrutiny into Russia's role in the 2016 campaign, including contact between the country's government and Trump aides, has further hampered the president's agenda, especially after his firing of FBI Director James Comey.  Still, surprises from the administration, shifts in the Federal Reserve's plan to decrease securities investments that quadrupled its balance sheet to $4.5 trillion or an upset in British parliamentary elections June 8 could roil markets in the coming month -- and boost trading volumes.

"We are writing to express our strong support for the United States remaining in the Paris Climate Agreement," it said. "President Trump, stay in Paris and negotiate a better deal that creates jobs," according to the commercial that is also available on YouTube. The advertisement was signed by the heads of 3M, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Proctor & Gamble, General Electric, Johnson & Johnson, The Dow Chemical Company, Tesla, Citigroup and The Disney Company. The Paris Agreement, which was spearheaded by former President Barack Obama and signed by 195 countries in April 2016, aims to fight climate change by reducing carbon emissions and limiting global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius. During his election campaign, however, Trump called global warming "a hoax" and promised to scrap the agreement and return jobs to the coal industry that is often an easy target for environmentalists. "I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!," Trump said via Twitter on Wednesday.

Morgan and the banking sector By Mark DeCambre Published: June 1, 2017 7:50 a.m. ET Share Goldman’s stock closes around 6-month low at $211.26, highlighting pain confronting financial sector Getty Images It’s been a tough Wednesday for Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein. By MarkDeCambre Shares of some of the U.S.’s largest financial institutions are getting hammered Wednesday, led by a sharp drop in Goldman Sachs’s stock, as bank executives were signaling a slump in second-quarter trading, pointing to the possibility of woeful revenue figures in the financial sector. “Performance is quite good, but there’s not a lot to trade around right now.…There haven’t been that many exciting events, and we need a few more of them.” J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.51% CFO Marianne Lake said at an industry conference on Wednesday. She said trading was on track to slip 15%, compared with the comparable period a year ago. Those comments played a part in pushing Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s shares GS, -0.79% to their lowest level in about six months, according to FactSet. Goldman’s shares notched their first record high since the 2007-09 recession back in February, but they have mostly drifted lower since. Wednesday’s 3.3% slide in the blue-chip component exacted a 50-point toll on the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.29% with a 2.2% slide in J.P. Morgan’s shares pulling the Dow down by another 12 points. The Dow finished Wednesday down 0.1% at 21,008, with gains in 3M Co. MMM, +1.15% DuPont Inc. DD, +0.59% and Travelers Cos. Inc. TRV, -0.20% helping to pare some of the average’s slide. Lake’s comments come as a rally in financials, dubbed the “Trump rally”—borne on hope of Wall Street deregulation, tax cuts and a boost in infrastructure spending—has all but unraveled. The exchange-traded Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF, -0.38% which posted a 24% gain from Nov. 8, Election Day, to March 2, have dropped 6.7% since that March peak. An ETF tracking regional banks, the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF KRE, -0.74% is off 10% during that period. Bank stocks are the second worst performer among the S&P 500 index’s 11 sectors, losing 1.8% for the month, behind only the energy sector’s 4% tumble. Over the past three months, financials have declined 5.6%, the third worst performance over that stretch behind energy’s 8% drop and a 6.6% fall in telecommunications shares. The downbeat trade for banks comes even as the Federal Reserve is trying to lift interest rates off ultralow levels, which should be supportive of bank’s business models and shares. But a spate of lackluster economic reports, including those on pending home sales, have cast some doubt on how rapidly the central bank will normalize monetary policy, bearish for banks. Providing another headwind are benchmark 10-year Treasury rates TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.44% used to price car loans, mortgages and other debt instruments, which slipped to a five-week low at 2.20% on Wednesday. Benchmark rates have been stubbornly low for months, despite the Fed’s tightening agenda. Those factors have combined to give investors pause about growth prospects for the banking sector. Goldman posted its worst first-quarter performance in 12 years as its bread-and-butter trading business sputtered, leading many to conclude that Wednesday’s warning may augur more pain for the sector unless the economy and rate increases, or both, rev up soon. Uncharacteristically low volatility, with the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, -1.42% trading well below its historic average of 20, has added to trading woes. As Lake suggested, protracted periods of quietude can impede the fee-generating ability of banks, which prosper from high volumes and choppy markets in which investors think they can identify big trading opportunities.

Dlouhy, Bloomberg Published 10:58 am, Wednesday, May 31, 2017 CBS News reported Wednesday that President Trump is likely to withdraw from the Paris climate deal. Media: GeoBeats (Bloomberg) -- As Donald Trump nears a final decision on the Paris climate agreement, top corporate executives are mounting a last-minute push aimed at persuading the president that the U.S. has more to lose from abandoning the accord. The appeals from chief executives such as Tesla Inc.’s Elon Musk, Tim Cook of Apple Inc. and Dow Chemical Co.’s Andrew Liveris come as Trump’s advisers also present him with closing arguments on the potential risks and rewards of remaining a party to the global pact. Trump also got an earful from foreign leaders and Pope Francis urging him to stay in the agreement during his first international trip as president. Cook placed a call to the White House on Tuesday to urge the president to keep the U.S. in the agreement, according to a person familiar with the move. Liveris was the driving force behind a letter from 30 major company executives backing the deal. And Musk tweeted Wednesday that he has “done all I can to advise directly to" Trump. If the U.S. leaves Paris, Musk said he would drop participation in White House advisory councils. Corporate leaders "are continuing to try to get through to the White House in any and every way they can," said Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, the non-profit sustainability advocacy that works with investors. They "are particularly important stakeholders for this president," she said.

The order also calls for the U.S Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security to block federal grants to "sanctuary cities" that do not follow federal immigration laws.

Photo: AFP/AFP/Getty Images Image 26 of 26 Tim Cook calls Trump, Elon Musk threatens to pull back over Paris decision 1 / 26 Back to Gallery The executives are trying to capitalize on Trump’s "America first" ideology by warning that a withdrawal would put the U.S. at a disadvantage in a global race to develop and deploy clean-energy technology, potentially ceding that market opportunity to China, the world’s top emitter of greenhouse gas emissions. A television advertisement that began running Wednesday cites 10 of "America’s biggest CEOs," including JP Morgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon and General Electric Co.’s Jeffrey Immelt, as backing the climate pact "because it will benefit American manufacturing and generate jobs." Trump tweeted Wednesday that he would announce his decision on the Paris accord "over the next few days." While Trump is leaning toward exiting the pact, according to people familiar with the White House deliberations, the situation remained fluid amid intense last-minute lobbying. The people requested anonymity because Trump’s decision has not yet been officially announced. The president’s verdict will be driven by "what’s best for the United States," said Gary Cohn, his top economic adviser, during Trump’s recent trip abroad.  Twenty-five companies, including Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp. and PG&E Corp., have signed on to a letter set to run as a full-page advertisement in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal on Thursday arguing in favor of climate pact. "By expanding markets for innovative clean technologies, the agreement generates jobs and economic growth," the open letter says. "U.S. companies are well positioned to lead in these markets. Withdrawing from the agreement will limit our access to them and could expose us to retaliatory measures." Some companies that favor continued U.S. involvement in the deal stand to benefit directly from greater worldwide demand for lower-emission technology and energy sources, such as natural gas and renewable power. For instance, natural gas producers Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc have endorsed the pact, as has Cheniere Energy Inc., which exports liquefied natural gas. Campaign Issue Not all corporations are in line on the Paris agreement. Some coal producers, including Murray Energy Corp., vociferously oppose the pact. Robert E. Murray, the founder and chief executive officer of the mining company, told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday that Trump has a responsibility to fulfill his campaign pledges and jettison the agreement. The president should "listen to those who voted for him," Murray said. Others warn that U.S. companies could face repercussions globally, including consumer-driven boycotts of their products. “The business community has spoken with a loud and clear voice that if the decision is to leave Paris it not in line with the thinking of the vast majority of mainstream business in the United States," said David Stearns, communications director for The B Team, a group of corporate leaders urging sustainable practices. "If you look at every sector -- financial, banking, major employers, high-tech, oil and gas, coal companies -- they’ve all been saying that staying in Paris makes sense from a number of perspectives." --With assistance from Alex Webb Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

By WallaceWitkowski Reporter MarkDeCambre Editor’s note: Chicago-area economic activity rose to a 2½-year high in May. MNI Indicator earlier released an incorrect report on Chicago-area economic activity, representing a fall in May. The Chicago business barometer, or Chicago PMI, rose to 59.4 in May from 58.3. U.S. stocks closed lower on Wednesday, but off their worst levels of the session, notching gains for the month as a slump in bank shares and a mixed reading of economic reports weighed on investor sentiment. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.37% fell 1.11 points, or less than 0.1%, to close at 2,411.80, recovering from an earlier 9-point deficit, with only four of the market gauge’s 11 sectors closing lower. The financial sector finished down 0.8%, representing the worst performer, and energy shares closed down 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.29%  closed down 20.82 points, or 0.1%, at 21,008.65, with shares of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.51% and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -0.79% dragging blue chips firmly into the red with more than 2% losses. Combined, the pair of bank stocks contributed to the lion’s share of the Dow’s loss. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.94% after briefly touching an intraday high of 6,221.99, finished down 4.67 points, or less than 0.1%, at 6,198.52. For the month, the Nasdaq has been the best-performing among major indexes, up 2.5% in May, followed by a 1.2% gain for the S&P 500. Both indexes had their best monthly percentage gains since February. The Dow hung on to a meager gain of 0.3%. Financials took a hit because two of the largest U.S. banks signaled signs of a trading slowdown on the same day, said Ian Winer, head of the equities division at Wedbush Securities. Both J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America Corp. BAC, -0.80%  cautioned at an industry conferences on Wednesday that trading is weakening in the second quarter. Couple that with the drop in oil prices and reports that former FBI Director James Comey will publicly testify that President Donald Trump pushed him to end the probe into former national-security adviser Michael Flynn and you have a market that is going to sell off, Winer said. Energy shares continued their downtrend Wednesday with U.S. crude-oil prices CLN7, +1.24% dipping below $48 and settling down 2.7% at $48.32 a barrel. “Banks are being cautious and that has to make people a little nervous, and the market continues to plow money into the same names everyday,” said Winer, citing stocks like Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.08% Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +0.89% GOOGL, +0.79% Tesla Inc. TSLA, -0.15%  and Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.50% all of which are up 25% or more for the year. “I’m concerned that there are quantitative models out there that are ‘buy high, buy higher’ so you have this strange phenomenon feeding on itself where [those stocks] become a bigger part of the S&P 500,” he said. The benchmarks took a decided turn for the worse Wednesday after a reading for pending-home sales came in below expectations. Pending-home sales from the National Association of Realtors fell 1.3% to a level of 109.8 from a reduction in the March reading. Meanwhile, a gauge of economic health, the Chicago business barometer, or Chicago PMI, rose to 59.4 in May, its highest level in 2½ years. Earlier, reporting agency MNI Indicators had mistakenly said the gauge fell to 55.2. Any reading over 50 indicates improving conditions. Stocks pared gains slightly following the corrected PMI reading. The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, or anecdotal report of regional conditions, said the economy is still growing at a “modest or moderate” pace, appearing to support a June rate increase. Even so, the market may be at a tipping point where a recent trend of soft data may support bearish views that economic growth doesn’t warrant two additional rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2017, said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. The Fed is widely expected to lift rates in June by a quarter point. “The question the market is grappling with is, is the Fed raising rates in an environment in which perhaps the economic data are weakening more than you should see for a rate-hike cycle?” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The Fed has been clear [in past policy statements] that weaker data are just noise and that we are moving toward a stronger economic backdrop but at this stage the dollar should rise; also, we see 10-year yields which haven’t moved higher,” she said. Indeed, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.60% hit a five-week low, dropping below 2.20% on Wednesday, while the dollar, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.04% a gauge of the buck against six rivals, traded lower for most of the day but was last up 0.1%. “People are looking for reasons to buy, but it doesn’t take a lot for markets to tumble back,” Cieszynski said. “I think some traders are starting to throw in the towel.” Need to know: Tech rally overdone? The case for buying other stock sectors now Read: This money manager sees no end in sight for bull market. Fed speakers: Among Fed speakers, San Francisco Fed President John Williams will give a speech on “global economic and financial challenges” at the Bank of Korea International Conference 2017 in Seoul, South Korea, at 8:10 p.m. Eastern. Stocks to watch: Shares of Michael Kors Holdings Inc. KORS, -0.09% finished down 8.5% after the maker of high-end accessories and clothing posted a loss for its fiscal fourth quarter and spoke of a challenging market. Energy stocks also performed poorly on the slip in oil, but pared losses a bit by the close. Shares of Transocean Ltd. RIG, -2.17%  declined 1.9%, Chesapeake Energy Corp. CHK, -2.75%  dipped 0.8%, and Murphy Oil Corp. MUR, -2.87%  fell 1.1%. Vera Bradley Inc. VRA, +1.60%  shares finished 11% higher, despite a weak quarterly report. Other markets: Stocks in Asia ADOW, -0.37%  had a mixed day, while Chinese equities inched higher after a gauge of manufacturing beat forecasts. European stocks SXXP, +0.23%  finished fractionally lower. The FTSE 100 index UKX, +0.05%  gave back earlier gains, closing in the red on fresh parliamentary election jitters. The pound GBPUSD, -0.1629%  was trading around $1.29, in up-and-down trade for sterling ahead of the coming U.K. election. Gold prices GCN7, +0.23%  settled up 0.8% at $1,275.40 an ounce as the dollar slumped, giving dollar-priced assets room to climb, because a weaker dollar makes those assets more attractive to buyers using weaker currencies. —Barbara Kollmeyer in Madrid contributed to this article.

Economists had forecast pending home sales, which become sales after a month or two, rising 0.5 per cent last month. They fell 3.3 per cent from a year ago.

After a week that began with a public spat with the EU over Brexit negotiations. By Ivana Kottasová LONDON (CNNMoney) -- Is political gridlock actually a good thing for Britain? That's the argument made by some analysts after an election projection showed that Prime Minister Theresa May is in danger of losing her majority in parliament. The pound -- which is highly sensitive to negative Brexit news -- slumped below $1.28 after the release of the YouGov projection. But the currency quickly rebounded. Here's one way to explain the reaction: A clear victory for May would preserve the political status quo including the risk of a very messy divorce from the European Union. But a hung parliament -- where no party has a majority -- could force British politicians to compromise on Brexit and lead to a less painful exit from the EU. "All hell could break loose metaphorically speaking, at least at first," said Kallum Pickering, an economist at Berenberg Bank. "However, if a hung parliament forced a cross-party compromise it could lead to a softer Brexit strategy, and may turn out to be positive in the long run." Analysts at JPMorgan agreed. They said that a governing coalition consisting of left-of-center parties could keep the U.K.'s current trade and immigration policies in place. May called the June 8 election in hopes of strengthening the Conservative Party's position in parliament while earning a mandate to pursue a clean break from the EU. Doing so would take Britain out of Europe's unified trading market, but allow May to deliver on her signature promise to reduce the number of people coming to Britain from the EU. May, who once enjoyed a massive lead in the polls, has also said that she prefers "no deal" with the EU to a "bad deal." No deal could cause chaos by introducing barriers to trade and disrupting complex supply chains. Airlines say air traffic could be thrown into confusion because they rely on EU agreements. Automakers may have to move some production elsewhere. The Centre for European Reform, a think tank, has warned that crashing out of the union would be "massively disruptive." "The costs to the U.K. economy of failing to strike a deal would dwarf those of signing up to a bad deal," the group said in a research note. Labour, the main opposition party, would not try to reverse the decision to leave the EU. But it does want to retain "the benefits of the single market and customs union." Its potential governing partners have their own ideas: The Liberal Democrats want a referendum on any deal with the EU, and the Scottish National Party is pushing for Scotland to stay in Europe's unified market. Analysts have also cautioned against reading too much into pre-election polls and projections. Unreliable data and an uncertain political landscape make the election result especially difficult to predict. "Before getting carried away ... it should be noted that the betting markets still have the Conservatives as overwhelming favorites to secure a majority," said JPMorgan analysts.

KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 percent to 3,102.21 while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 1 percent to 19,854.27. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 0.4 percent to 25,752.44 and Seoul's Kospi shed 0.1 percent to 2,344.29. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.2 percent to 5,733.90 and benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Southeast Asia also advanced. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks fell on a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for tech companies. That offset gains for drug makers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell after executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drug makers and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost less than 0.1 percent to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.1 percent to 21,008.65. CHINESE MANUFACTURING: The Chinese business magazine Caixin said its purchasing managers' index declined for a third month, falling to 49.6 from April's 50.3 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity contracting. That came after a separate PMI on Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics and an industry group, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, improved to 54.5 from 54. "Yesterday's official PMI reading had hinted at growth having remained broadly stable last month," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. "But today's downbeat unofficial PMI suggests conditions may not have held up as well as previously thought." TRUMP AND CLIMATE: President Donald Trump was preparing to announce a decision on whether to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Trump promoted his announcement Wednesday night on Twitter, after a day in which U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of a U.S. withdrawal. Trump himself kept everyone in suspense, saying he was still listening to "a lot of people both ways." Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement to fight global warming by reducing carbon emissions. Withdrawing would leave the United States aligned only with Russia among the world's industrialized economies. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. oil gained 38 cents to $48.70 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.34 on Wednesday to close at $48.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 40 cents to $51.16 in London. It dropped $1.48 the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 110.92 yen from Wednesday's 110.76. The euro edged down to $1.1244 from $1.1247. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON WASHINGTON Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes fell for a second straight month in April amid a supply squeeze, but the housing market recovery remains supported by a strong labor market. The National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, dropped 1.3 percent to 109.8. Contracts fell in the Northeast, Midwest and South, but surged 5.8 percent in the West. Coming on the heels of recent data showing a drop in home building and sales of both new and previously owned homes, the decrease in contracts suggests a moderation in housing activity. Still, housing is expected to contribute to gross domestic product this year. "We think that the housing recovery will continue over time based on favorable fundamentals in the market, but we have seen some weakening in a number of home sale measures lately," said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. "For now, we think the recent softening in sales is a pause in a broader upward trend." Economists had forecast pending home sales, which become sales after a month or two, rising 0.5 percent last month. They fell 3.3 percent from a year ago. That is the first year-on-year drop since last December and the largest since June 2014. The PHLX housing index .HGX was little changed amid a broadly weaker stock market. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices were trading higher. Demand for housing is being driven by a tight labor market, marked by a 4.4 percent unemployment rate, which is generating wage increases and boosting employment opportunities for young Americans. The housing market remains supported by historically low mortgage rates, with the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaging 3.95 percent, the lowest level since last November. Sales activity, however, remains constrained by tight inventories, which are driving up home prices. Housing inventory has dropped for 23 straight months on a year-on-year basis. Home resales declined 2.3 percent in April and could decrease in May as another report on Wednesday showed applications for loans to buy a home fell for a third straight week last week. "The large declines in the Northeast and Midwest suggest seasonal factors exaggerated the recent slide in pending home sales," said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. "Mortgage applications add a note of caution, however." A third report showed manufacturing activity in the Midwest region accelerated to a 2-1/2-year high in May. The Chicago Purchasing Management Index rose to a reading of 59.4 this month, the highest level since November 2014, from 58.3 in April.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 11:50 PM, May 31, 2017 Updated: 8:55 AM, June 1, 2017 Shares in U.S. banks fell on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 bank index <.SPXBK> hitting its lowest level since late 2016, after JPMorgan Chase <JPM.N> and Bank of America Corp <BAC.N> warned of revenue weakness in the current quarter. The bank index fell as much as 2.34 percent. Bank of America and JPMorgan each fell more than 2 percent and were the biggest drags on the S&P 500 <.SPX>. Goldman Sachs <GS.N>, which is in the S&P financial sector index <.SPSY>, fell 3.7 percent after it gave a trading update. JPMorgan's trading revenue has fallen 15 percent so far in the second quarter, its chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, told investors at a conference. She would not provide a prediction for June. Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan, meanwhile, told investors the bank's second-quarter trading revenue would be lower than a year ago. "It's especially difficult because of the year-over-year comparison. The first and second quarter in 2016 were fairly busy on the trading front," said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. Investors were disappointed that JPMorgan's CFO did not predict a turnaround for June, Grant said. "People are digging in for a bit of a slower summer here," he said. "If the big banks don't see anything on the horizon, then it potentially does not bode well for others. Volatility is non-existent. It's difficult to generate trading volumes or commissions or when the VIX is at historically low levels." The U.S. stock market's main gauge of investor anxiety closed at its lowest level in over two decades on May 8. The CBOE Volatility Index <.VIX> was up 4.8 percent at 10.88 on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs President David Solomon declined to give specifics about the bank’s trading business at an investor conference, but said subdued volatility - which depressed client activity in the first quarter - continued into April and May. JPMorgan shares were last down 2.5 percent at $81.84 after hitting their lowest level since Dec. 2, with trading volume 1.3 times the 10-day moving average. Bank of America shares were down 2.9 percent at $22.17 after earlier hitting a low of $22.09, also in heavy trading. Citigroup Corp <C.N> was down 2 percent at $60.38 while Huntington Bancshares Inc <HBAN.O> was the second biggest percentage loser in the bank subsector with a 2.6 percent drop. Goldman Sachs shares hit their lowest point since late November and were last down 3.7 at $210.43 after hitting a low of $209.62. Trading volume in the stock was 1.8 times its 10-day moving average.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Posted: Wednesday, May 31, 2017 5:43 pm | Updated: 8:24 pm, Wed May 31, 2017. Most Asian stock markets rise after Wall Street loss Associated Press | 0 comments BEIJING (AP) — Chinese stocks declined Thursday after a survey showed manufacturing weakening while other Asian markets gained after Wall Street fell for a second day. KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 percent to 3,102.21 while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 1 percent to 19,854.27. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 0.4 percent to 25,752.44 and Seoul's Kospi shed 0.1 percent to 2,344.29. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.2 percent to 5,733.90 and benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Southeast Asia also advanced. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks fell on a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for tech companies. That offset gains for drug makers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell after executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drug makers and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost less than 0.1 percent to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.1 percent to 21,008.65. CHINESE MANUFACTURING: The Chinese business magazine Caixin said its purchasing managers' index declined for a third month, falling to 49.6 from April's 50.3 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity contracting. That came after a separate PMI on Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics and an industry group, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, improved to 54.5 from 54. "Yesterday's official PMI reading had hinted at growth having remained broadly stable last month," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. "But today's downbeat unofficial PMI suggests conditions may not have held up as well as previously thought." TRUMP AND CLIMATE: President Donald Trump was preparing to announce a decision on whether to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Trump promoted his announcement Wednesday night on Twitter, after a day in which U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of a U.S. withdrawal. Trump himself kept everyone in suspense, saying he was still listening to "a lot of people both ways." Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement to fight global warming by reducing carbon emissions. Withdrawing would leave the United States aligned only with Russia among the world's industrialized economies. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. oil gained 38 cents to $48.70 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.34 on Wednesday to close at $48.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 40 cents to $51.16 in London. It dropped $1.48 the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 110.92 yen from Wednesday's 110.76. The euro edged down to $1.1244 from $1.1247. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The bank index was last down 1.72 percent and hit its lowest point since Dec. 5. Bank of America, JPMorgan and Citigroup Corp were the biggest drags on the S&amp;P 500, with more than 2 percent declines each. JPMorgan's trading revenue has fallen 15 percent so far in the second quarter, the bank's Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told investors at a conference. She would not give a prediction for June. Bank of America's chief executive meanwhile told investors the bank's second-quarter trading revenue would be lower than a year ago. "It's especially difficult because of the year-over-year comparison. The first and second quarter in 2016 were fairly busy on the trading front," said RJ Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods in New York. Investors were disappointed that JPMorgan's CFO did not predict a turnaround for June, said Grant. "People are digging in for a bit of a slower summer here," he said. "If the big banks don't see anything on the horizon then it potentially does not bode well for others. Volatility is non-existent. Its difficult to generate trading volumes or commissions or when the VIX is at historically low levels." The U.S. stock market's main gauge of investor anxiety closed at its lowest level in over two decades on May 8. The CBOE Volatility Index was up 4.8 percent at 10.88 on Wednesday. JPMorgan shares were last down 1.8 percent at $82.41 after hitting their lowest level since Dec. 2, with trading volume 0.6 times the 10-day moving average. Bank of America shares were down 2.3 percent at $22.31 after earlier hitting a low of $22.09, also in heavy trading. Huntington Bancshares Inc was the biggest percentage loser in the bank subsector with a 2.7 percent drop.

The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped 0.1 percent at 3:24 p.m. in London, erasing an earlier advance of as much as 0.5 percent. Lenders followed US peers lower after JPMorgan Chase & Co. said revenue from its trading businesses declined in the second quarter. Disappointing US housing data also weighed on investor sentiment. Tell a friend File image In the UK, the FTSE 100 Index jumped as much as 0.8 percent to an intraday record before trading 0.2 percent higher. Ahead of next week’s general election in the country, a Panelbase poll conducted May 19-23 showed the Tories getting 48 percent of the vote and the Labour Party winning 33 percent.

Morgan Slash Nearly 60 Points From Dow Industrials ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More Goldman, J.P. Morgan Slash Nearly 60 Points From Dow Industrials By Mark DeCambre Published May 31, 2017 Markets MarketWatch Pulse Facebook Twitter Print The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday was getting dragged lower, with a slump in shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., serving as the biggest weight on the blue-chip gauge. Goldman was contributing to a roughly 45-point decline in the price-weighted Dow , while shares of J.P. Morgan were subtracting about 12 points from the average. The downturn for bank stocks, which was broad based, came as a batch of weak economic reports on economic activity in Chicago and pending-home sales, were seen as reducing the pace of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The market is betting that the Fed will raise rates next month when it holds a policy-setting convention, but another rate hike, as early as September, is being discounted due to the lackluster economic data, market strategists said. Rate hikes tend to be beneficial for banks' business models. Comments from J.P. Morgan's CFO Marianne Lake also provided a headwind for the sector. Lake told investors on Wednesday at an industry conference that trading at the bank was slumping, though she referred to it as seasonally normal, The Wall Street Journal reported. More broadly, the S&P 500 index was down 4 points, or 0.2%, at 2,408, with financials off 1.2%. The Nasdaq Composite Index , which briefly hit an intraday record, was off 23 points, or 0.4%, at 6,179. Continue Reading Below Copyright © 2017 MarketWatch, Inc.

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Posted: Wednesday, May 31, 2017 10:43 pm | Updated: 11:00 pm, Wed May 31, 2017. Most Asian stock markets rise after Wall Street loss Associated Press | BEIJING (AP) — Chinese stocks declined Thursday after a survey showed manufacturing weakening while other Asian markets gained after Wall Street fell for a second day. KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 percent to 3,102.21 while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 1 percent to 19,854.27. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 0.4 percent to 25,752.44 and Seoul's Kospi shed 0.1 percent to 2,344.29. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.2 percent to 5,733.90 and benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Southeast Asia also advanced. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks fell on a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for tech companies. That offset gains for drug makers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell after executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drug makers and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost less than 0.1 percent to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.1 percent to 21,008.65. CHINESE MANUFACTURING: The Chinese business magazine Caixin said its purchasing managers' index declined for a third month, falling to 49.6 from April's 50.3 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity contracting. That came after a separate PMI on Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics and an industry group, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, improved to 54.5 from 54. "Yesterday's official PMI reading had hinted at growth having remained broadly stable last month," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. "But today's downbeat unofficial PMI suggests conditions may not have held up as well as previously thought." TRUMP AND CLIMATE: President Donald Trump was preparing to announce a decision on whether to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Trump promoted his announcement Wednesday night on Twitter, after a day in which U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of a U.S. withdrawal. Trump himself kept everyone in suspense, saying he was still listening to "a lot of people both ways." Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement to fight global warming by reducing carbon emissions. Withdrawing would leave the United States aligned only with Russia among the world's industrialized economies. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. oil gained 38 cents to $48.70 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.34 on Wednesday to close at $48.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 40 cents to $51.16 in London. It dropped $1.48 the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 110.92 yen from Wednesday's 110.76. The euro edged down to $1.1244 from $1.1247. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
