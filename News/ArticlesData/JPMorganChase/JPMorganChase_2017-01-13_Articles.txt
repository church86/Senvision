A big part of the recent gains for stocks like JPMorgan ( JPM : up +23.1% since November 8th), Bank of America ( BAC : up +34.8% in that time period) and others reflect market participants' hopes that the incoming administration will roll back all or most of the regulatory constraints, implement tax reform, and give the U.S. economy's growth trajectory a positive nudge. But the more tangible catalyst for bank earnings, particularly this earnings season, has been the post-election uptrend in interest rates. We didn't really see the full impact of higher interest rates on the banks' net interest margins in Q4 results. But higher interest rates, increased confidence and the resultant enhanced appetite for risks did juice JPMorgan and Bank of America's trading revenues. JPMorgan's trading revenues were up +24% from the year-earlier level, with fixed income trading revenues up +31%. Bank of America showed strong gains in fixed income trading as well, with the bank's Q4 fixed income trading revenues up +12% from the year-earlier level. This momentum in trading revenues offers favorable read-throughs for Goldman Sachs ( GS ), which reports next week (Jan. 18th) and has a storied trading franchise. Morgan Stanley ( MS ), which reports a day ahead of Goldman, has been reducing its trading business over the last many years. It is still fairly early, with results from only 5 Finance sector companies in the S&P 500 (out of 90 total) out already, but these 5 companies are the some of the largest in the entire index and account for more than a quarter of the sector's total market capitalization. Total earnings for these 5 Finance sector companies are up +15.6% from the same period last year on +1.4% higher revenues, with all 5 beating EPS estimates but only 2 beating top-line estimates. This is better earnings growth than we have seen from the same group of 5 banks in other recent periods, which is having a favorable impact on the aggregate Q4 growth expectation for the sector as a whole. Total Q4 earnings for the Finance sector as a whole, combining the reported actuals with the still-to-come estimates, are expected to be up +17.1% from the same period last year. The table below shows the sector's Q4 earnings growth expectations at the medium-industry level contrasted with estimates for the following four quarters and actual results for the preceding three periods. Please note that the Major Banks industry, of which JPMorgan, Bank of America and others are part, accounts for roughly 45% of the sector's total earnings (insurance is the second biggest earnings contributor, accounting for about 25% of the total). The sector's growth pace for the quarter remains in double-digits even after we adjust for the easy comparisons at AIG ( AIG ). Excluding AIG, the sector's Q4 earnings would be up +11.7%. The sector's earnings are on track to be flat in 2016. But they were expected to be up materially in 2017 and 2018 even before the aforementioned favorable developments. The chart below shows the sector's annual earnings growth expectations. With a number of policy oriented developments still to unfold after the new administration takes office, it is reasonable expect positive revisions to these expectations. And if that is the case, then bank stocks should continue their momentum. Valuations have no doubt caught up with underlying fundamentals, but they are by no means stretched relative to historical periods, particularly given the emerging interest rate trajectory. Q4 Scorecard ( as of Friday, January 13th ) With Q4 results from 29 S&P 500 members already on the books, total earnings are up +11.2% on +3.1% higher revenues, with 69% beating EPS estimates and 44.8% coming ahead of top-line expectations. The table below provides the current Q4 scorecard The charts below provide a comparison of the results thus far with what we have seen from this same group of 29 S&P 500 members in other recent periods. As you can see, the Q4 growth pace, particularly for earnings, is notably tracking above what we had seen from the same group of 29 index members in other recent periods. But positive surprises seem to be hard to come by, with revenue surprises particularly on the weak side. That said, the sample size is still on the small side and will most likely shift as the reporting cycle ramps up this week. We have 81 companies reporting results this week, including 34 S&P 500 members. The chart below shows the weekly summary reporting calendar for companies in the S&P 500 index. Q4 Expectations As a Whole For Q4 as a whole, total earnings for the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up +4.2% from the same period last year on +3.8% higher revenues. This would follow the +3.8% growth in Q3 earnings on +2.3% higher revenues, the first instance of positive earnings growth for the index after five quarters of back-to-back declines. Comparisons for the Energy sector, a big driver of the earnings recession, turn positive in Q4, with the sector's earnings growth turning positive for the first time after 8 quarters of declines. The chart below shows that positive earnings growth resumed in 2016 Q3 after 5 quarters of declines, with the growth pace expected to improve in Q4 and ramp up notably in the following quarters. The table below shows the summary picture Q4 contrasted with what was actually achieved in the preceding quarter.

(AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) AP US stock indexes end mostly higher on solid bank earnings By ALEX VEIGA AP Business Writer Jan 13, 2017 Updated Jan 13, 2017 (…) Mary Altaffer FILE - This Tuesday, Oct. 25, 2016, file photo shows the New York Stock Exchange at sunset, in lower Manhattan. U.S. stock indexes moved higher in early trading Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 as investors pored over earnings reports from several big lenders. Banks and other financial companies were up the most. Utilities were the biggest laggard. Energy stocks also fell as crude oil prices headed lower. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Story continues below video × Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. "We all thought financials would do well," said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. "Now how about the other areas of the economy?" The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $86.70. Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 percent overall in December, mainly due to a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. "If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it's not an impressive number," Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp., home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid $3.82, or 4.1 percent, to $89.31. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $44.20. Gap shed 34 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $23.66. Traders also had their eye on companies that issued outlooks for their upcoming earnings reports. Pandora Media climbed 6.3 percent after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7 percent of its jobs to reduce costs. The stock added 76 cents to $12.765. HomeStreet fell 6 percent after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid $1.85 to $29.10. GameStop tumbled 8.1 percent after the video game retailer said holiday revenue dropped because of discounts and weak sales of new "Call of Duty" and "Titanfall" games. The stock shed $1.99 to $22.73. Energy prices were mixed. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. The slide in crude prices helped pull down shares in energy sector stocks. Oilfield services company Baker Hughes slid $1.50, or 2.4 percent, to $60.92, while drilling services company Transocean lost 36 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.48. Marathon Petroleum fell 87 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $48.38. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet. Major stock indexes in Europe closed higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.9 percent, while France's CAC 40 gained 1.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent. Earlier in Asia, some markets finished lower on disappointing trade data from China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8 percent. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 0.8 percent. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.39 percent from 2.36 percent late Thursday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.42 yen from 114.63 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.0646 from $1.0626. The price of gold fell $3.60 to $1,196.20 an ounce. Silver slid 6 cents to $16.77 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.69 a pound.

Home Issues Experts Newsletters & Trading Services Login Is Trump Making CEO Bank Accounts Great Again? Posted on January 13, 2017 by Brad Hoppmann Donald Trump is still a week away from becoming the 45th president of the United States. Yet that hasn’t stopped him from making CEO stock options great again. That’s the thrust of a recent Reuters story on the big gains in CEO stock option values since the billionaire businessman won the White House. Here’s the first, and quite compelling, paragraph from the article: Donald Trump once described Jamie Dimon as “the worst banker in the United States,” but the president-elect has helped make the boss of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM) $50 million richer. Becoming $50 million richer since the election isn’t too shabby. So, if you’re a bit jealous of Mr. Dimon right now, I understand. The story point outs that the JPMorgan chief is just one of many high-profile CEOs to run companies where the share prices have spiked since Election Day. Reuters conducted an analysis of CEO option grants from the companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It found that things really are great again for many of the world’s top chief executives. Image credit: mandelman.ml-implode.com Per Reuters: Stock options held by Dow 30 CEOs surged in value by 23 percent to about $1 billion in 2016, with most of the gain coming after Trump’s election win. Reuters said that the figures reflect outstanding stock options that could be exercised at the end of 2015, and not options that expired or vested in 2016. The Reuters analysis pointed out that Jamie Dimon has seen his stock options spike in value by more than $50 million to $146 million since the election. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs (GS) CEO Lloyd Blankfein, a company that candidate Trump criticized harshly during the campaign, witnessed his stock options go from being worthless to being worth more than $11 million in a matter of weeks. Again, per the Reuters piece: Blankfein’s 322,104 outstanding options, granted in 2007 with a $204.16 strike price, were under water by $7.3 million on the eve of the presidential election. But by the end of 2016, their value had soared to $11.4 million. That was an $18.7 million swing, thanks to the Trump-inspired stock market rally and the U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision to increase interest rates, a boost for banks and credit card companies. Now, I don’t know which candidate for president Mr. Blankfein or Mr. Dimon voted for on Nov. 8, but I do know that both are Democrats. So, I presume that means they probably didn’t vote for Donald Trump (although I can’t be certain). My point here is not to comment on either executive’s vote. Nor is it to criticize CEO compensation in general, or to demonize those who have benefited mightily since Election Day. Related story: The Rich Got $237 Billion Richer in the ‘Year of Populism’ Rather, I want you to realize that the reality of investing (as well as the reality of life) is that — regardless of whether you love or hate the current state of politics or the politicians in charge — you need to know that even the whiff of the proposals proffered by them can really move markets. Goldman Sachs’ stock has soared 27% since Election Day, and JPM is up 18.2% in the same time frame. We’ve seen that already, not just in the Dow, but also in the S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and particularly the Nasdaq-100, which is up nearly 4% so far in this young 2017. In all of 2016, the Nasdaq-100 was up just 5.9%. The willingness on the part of Wall Street to, so far, buy into the Trump pro-growth, anti-regulation, lower-tax proposals reflects the optimism wafting throughout the country that we may indeed see a renewal of economic activity that “makes America great again.” Yet be forewarned here that if a President Trump and the Republican majority in Congress fail to deliver on the agenda Wall Street has bought into, then things could get very uncomfortable for the bulls … and very quickly. *** What say you about the increase in stock options for top executives in the Dow? Do you think Wall Street will continue buying into the Trump optimism trade? I’d love it if you shared your thoughts with me, and to do so all you have to do is leave me a comment on our website or send me an e-mail. *** Stocks finished the week slightly lower, although certain sectors (financials) helped buoy the major averages after strong earnings reports. The Nasdaq Composite closed at another record high. So did the FTSE 100 Index, which marked the UK’s 14th-straight day of gains. • Financials were the star of the trading show Friday, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) reported a beat on both its top and bottom lines for the fourth quarter thanks to solid performance across all its businesses. • Bank of America (BAC) also reported better-than-expected earnings Friday morning; however, revenue came in slightly below forecasts. The one bank that failed to impress was scandal-plagued Wells Fargo (WFC). The company missed on both earnings and revenue in Q4. • Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, the House of Representatives passed a budget bill Friday that is a procedural step toward repealing the “Affordable Care Act.” By a vote of 227-to-198, the House approved a budget resolution that instructs committees to write plans for repealing much of the law commonly known as Obamacare. The Senate approved the measure on Thursday. • On the security front, the TSA reported that a record number of guns — 3,391 — were discovered in passengers’ carry-on bags at American airports in 2016, up 28% from the year before. That’s an average of nine firearms per day. Good luck and happy investing, Brad Hoppmann Publisher Uncommon Wisdom Daily Your thoughts on “Is Trump Making CEO Bank Accounts Great Again?” Books says: January 13, 2017 at 7:01 pm Yep, the top people gain billions and the poor lose their healthcare and pensions. Reply Billy says: January 13, 2017 at 11:09 pm Hi Brad, This CEO compensation is simply disgusting! And all they are doing are coat tailing the final rally before problems set in with respect to capital markets. Should be the old buy the election sell the inauguration!!! Look, there is absolutely no question that Donald Trump will try to fix more things in Government than has been done by the last 8 presidents combined , but just him being president ABSOLUTELY WILL NOT solve the major imbalances of the world, namely the Worldwide and specifically European Sovereign DEBT CRISIS…We are absolutely overdue for a major stock market correction, which WILL ABSOLUTELY take place. A world with over $400 TRILLION in DEBT is extremely alarming, especially against a rising dollar, terrible demographics, massive overbuilding, especially in the commercial real estate sector, a shrinking middle class and most importantly, a millennium generation that is delaying family formation way into the future. Reply Paula says: January 14, 2017 at 1:28 pm Unintentionally. Trump is not in office yet, Obama is still in. The market went haywire because those who bought saw an opportunity to make money with the new administration coming in. People and businesses were euphoric. Also, the Fed raised interest rates which also made CEO’s smile, again, with a “democratic”administration. Reply Eleanor Allert says: January 14, 2017 at 3:29 pm Apparently Wall Street has already changed its mind about the Trump boost since his press conference. Is it possible he could still be presidential? Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment

Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which will lead to higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. "We all thought financials would do well," said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. "Now how about the other areas of the economy? The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $86.70. Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 percent overall in December, mainly due to a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. "If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it's not an impressive number," Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp., home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid $3.82, or 4.1 percent, to $89.31. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $44.20. Gap shed 34 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $23.66. Traders also had their eyes on companies that issued outlooks for their upcoming earnings reports. Pandora Media climbed 6.3 percent after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7 percent of its jobs to reduce costs.

Morgan Chase and Bank of America shares peaked at multidecade highs two months ago Everett Collection In 1976’s “Marathon Man,” Laurence Olivier (L) asks Dustin Hoffman (R), “Is it safe?” By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor If you’re wondering if it’s still safe to buy bank stocks, as earnings beats pushed J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. shares into record territory Friday, a bearish pattern in the charts suggests don’t do it — at least not for a while. J.P. Morgan’s stock JPM, +0.53%  closed up 0.5% on Friday, paring earlier gains of as much as 2.2% to an all-time intraday high of $88.17. The blue-chip bank reported before the market opened fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surged past expectations. B. of A.’s stock BAC, +0.39%  tacked on 0.4%, but was up 2.1% at a more than 8-year high of $23.41 earlier, as better-than-expected earnings offset a revenue miss. See also: The Trump question and 4 other things to know about this earnings season. Technicians like to say that there is nothing more bullish than a new high, unless of course the underlying technical indicators fail to validate the gains, which is a condition referred to as “bearish divergence.” And for the stocks of both JPMorgan and B. of A., a closely watched measure of momentum have actually been trending lower the past two months. FactSet For JPMorgan, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator that tracks how the magnitude of recent price gains compare with the magnitude of declines, reached an all-time high of 87.42 on Nov. 14. Many chart watchers view readings above 70 as suggesting an overbought condition. Although the stock has run up 9% since then, amid optimism over President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-business and antiregulation policy promises, the RSI has declined to 62.60 on Friday. B. of A’s RSI peaked at a 34-year high of 88.57 on Nov. 15, and has since fallen to 62.86 despite a 14% surge in the stock price. FactSet The SPDR Financial Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLF, +0.56% which houses both stocks, is also suffering from a bearish technical divergence. Don’t miss: Financial ETF nears highest level since 2008 after bullish bank results. Contrary to popular belief, overbought readings don’t mean a stock’s rally is close to over. As Constance Brown so proficiently pointed out in “Technical Analysis for the Trading Professional,” the ability to become overbought is actually a bullish sign. What can be bearish, however, is when technical oscillators such as RSI, which travel between zero and 100, fall below their overbought thresholds, and are unable to cross back above them despite continued gains in the stock price. Although JPMorgan and B. of A. shares have run up to new long-term intraday highs on Friday, JPMorgan’s RSI hasn’t peeked above 70 since Jan. 3, and B. of A.’s RSI hasn’t been above 70 since Dec. 15. Bearish divergences don’t always lead to long-term or even medium-term price tops, but they can, so they warn investors to wait until prices and technicals start telling the same story again. FactSet The sharp selloff in bank stocks in early 2014—JPMorgan’s tumbled 13% from late March to mid May that year and B. of A.’s plunged 19%—was preceded by bearish RSI divergences, as was JPMorgan’s pre-financial crisis peak in early May 2007 and B. of A.’s peak in late November 2006. For those looking to buy those stocks after a dip, don’t wait for the RSI to fall below the oversold threshold of 30, because if it does, it might suggest a longer-term downtrend may have started. For stocks in bull markets, Brown said “the 40 level is never broken.” FactSet For JPMorgan, some downside stock price levels to watch include the late December low of $85.04, previous resistance around $80.50, and the big one is the price gap between the Nov. 8 high of $70.54 and the Nov. 9 low of $71.32. Potential support levels for B. of A.’s stock include the late December low of $21.77, and the price gaps between Nov. 11 high and Nov. 12 low—$19.03 to $19.40—and between the Nov. 8 high and the Nov. 9 low—$17.10 to $17.40.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jan 13, 2017 at 6:08PM The Chase Tower in Dallas, Texas. Image source: Wikimedia Commons. If it wasn't clear before, it certainly is after fourth-quarter earnings: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has emerged as one of the biggest winners in the bank industry over the past decade. The bank reported on Friday that its earnings in the final three months of last year soared by $1.3 billion, or 24%, compared to the year-ago period. "Our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year, reflecting our intense client focus and solid performance across our businesses," noted chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon in prepared remarks. All told, JPMorgan Chase earned $6.3 billion in the fourth quarter. That's an enormous amount of money that puts the New York-based bank in a league of its own. The next two biggest banks in the United States -- Bank of America and Wells Fargo -- don't even come close, each earning less than $5 billion over the same three-month stretch. Data source: Fourth-quarter earnings releases. Chart by author. Elevated trading revenue JPMorgan's results were fueled by a surge in trading revenue, as the bank is one of -- if not the -- largest market maker on Wall Street.  The bank had said in December that its trading revenues were trending 15% or so higher compared to the same quarter last year. JPMorgan Chase's actual results came in above this. Its trading revenue increased 24% in the fourth quarter, to a record $4.5 billion. That compared to $3.6 billion in the year-ago period. The results for its fixed-income unit were even better, growing by 31%. The presidential election in November served as the catalyst for the surge. The unexpected outcome required institutional investors to reposition their portfolios in the election's wake. "When clients transact, we're able to capture the flow," said chief financial officer Marianne Lake on a conference call Friday. Higher interest rates The $2.5 trillion bank also benefited from higher interest rates, though not as much as it will in the current year. Higher interest rates broadly translate into higher rates on loans, specifically. And higher rates on loans translate into higher revenue and earnings for banks. According to JPMorgan, as of Sept. 30 of last year, a 100-basis-point increase in short- and long-term rates would equate to $3 billion or so in additional net interest income over the 12 months following the rise. If you divide that by four, you get a sense for the impact on a quarterly basis. JPMorgan didn't experience the full benefit from this trend, as rates didn't rise until well into the quarter. Long-term rates shot up 90 basis points in the wake of the presidential election. Short-term rates followed suit a month later as the Federal Reserve boosted the fed funds rate by 25 basis points at its monetary policy committee meeting in December. U.S. Target Federal Funds Rate data by YCharts. The upward trend in rates nevertheless contributed to a $500 million, or 5%, increase in JPMorgan's net interest income in the fourth quarter. The thing to watch now is the current quarter -- the first quarter of 2017 -- which should benefit from the entirety of the boost, pushing the bank's profits even higher. Finally, JPMorgan's record quarter was also helped by lower expenses and credit costs. The bank's operating costs fell by $430 million, or 3%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Its provision for loan losses shed 31%, or $387 million. All told, it was an extraordinary performance from one of the most venerable names in finance. And better yet, it seems as if things will only get better from here. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The Motley Fool has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Updated: January 15, 2017 @ 7:35 pm Full Forecast News Sports Business Photos Obits Classifieds AP Business Highlights By The Associated Press Updated Jan 13, 2017 ___ Millennials are falling behind their boomer parents SOUTH MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin (AP) — Baby Boomers: your millennial children are worse off than you. Millennials earn 20 percent less than boomers did at the same stage of life, despite being better educated, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve data by the advocacy group Young Invincibles. The analysis being released Friday gives concrete details about a troubling generational divide that helps to explain much of the anxiety that defined the 2016 election. Millennials have half the net worth of boomers. Their home ownership rate is lower, while their student debt is drastically higher. ___ Takata agrees to guilty plea, will pay $1B for hiding defect DETROIT (AP) — Takata Corp. has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge and will pay $1 billion in fines and restitution for a years-long scheme to conceal a deadly defect in its automotive air bag inflators. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit announced the deal Friday, hours after it unsealed a grand jury indictment against three former Takata executives accused of executing the scheme. Takata inflators can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel into automobiles. At least 11 people have been killed in the U.S. and 16 worldwide because of the defect. More than 180 have been injured. ___ US stock indexes end mostly higher on solid bank earnings Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. ___ More pay, greater confidence lifts US retail sales 0.6 pct. WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans stepped up their auto buying and online shopping in December, reflecting a boost in confidence after the election and a solid increase in pay. Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent, following a small 0.2 percent gain in November, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding autos and gas, retail sales overall were flat. Some economists were disappointed by that figure and said it suggested that many consumers remain cautious. ___ Wells Fargo profit falls after sales practice scandal NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo said Friday its profit fell 5 percent in the first full quarter after regulators said that bank employees opened millions of customer accounts fraudulently to meet sales goals. The scandal has kept new customers away, with the bank reporting that new account openings plummeted last month. In September, regulators fined the San Francisco-based bank $185 million for opening more than two million unauthorized accounts. The scandal brought nationwide attention to the bank, leading to the resignation of the bank's CEO John Stumpf in October. ___ Bank of America tops 4Q profit forecasts Bank of America's fourth-quarter profit jumped 47 percent as the nation's largest consumer bank benefited from higher interest rates and lower expenses. The bank said it earned a profit of $4.34 billion after payments to preferred shareholders, or 40 cents per share, up from $2.95 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results topped analysts' expectations, who were looking for 38 cents per share, according to FactSet. Like many consumer banks, BofA struggled to grow profits for the last several years due to record low interest rates. Now that the Federal Reserve has started increasing rates, BofA can charge more for loans. ___ JP Morgan Chase beats earnings forecasts NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. said its fourth quarter profit rose 24 percent from a year earlier, helped by higher interest rates and strong results from its trading operations. The nation's largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts' forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market's big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Pandora said late Thursday that the job cuts, which would exclude Ticketfly, are being done to help trim overall operating costs. The Oakland, California-based company has been facing increasing competition from Spotify and Apple Inc.'s music service. Pandora anticipates beating its previously announced forecast for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $362 million to $374 million, citing its strong advertising performance. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $369.6 million. ___ Liberty is depicted as black woman on $100 gold coin WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Mint has unveiled a commemorative $100 gold coin that features an image of Liberty as a black woman. The 2017 American Liberty 225th Anniversary Gold Coin shows the woman's head in profile with a crown of stars. It features the year of the mint's founding, 1792, as well as the year 2017. The mint says the other side of the coin will depict an eagle in flight. The coin will be released April 6. The Mint says it's the first in a series of 24-karat gold that will also depict Liberty in designs representing Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Indian-Americans. ___ Toyota adds 543,000 vehicles to Takata air bag recalls TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. says it is recalling another 543,000 vehicles in the U.S. for defective front passenger air bag inflators made by Japan's Takata Corp. Takata is at the center of a massive recall of inflators that can explode in a crash, spewing metal shrapnel inside the vehicles. Toyota said Friday that the recall includes various models of sedans and SUVs made between 2006 and 2012. Among those recalled are the 2008-2009 Scion xB; 2009 and 2012 Corolla and Corolla Matrix, 2007-2009 and 2012 Toyota Yaris, 2012 4Runner and Sienna and various versions of Lexus made between 2006 and 2012. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The S&P 500 index rose 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq gained 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet.

The scandal brought nationwide attention to the bank, leading to the resignation of the bank's CEO John Stumpf in October. --- Bank of America tops 4Q profit forecasts Bank of America's fourth-quarter profit jumped 47 percent as the nation's largest consumer bank benefited from higher interest rates and lower expenses. The bank said it earned a profit of $4.34 billion after payments to preferred shareholders, or 40 cents per share, up from $2.95 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results topped analysts' expectations, who were looking for 38 cents per share, according to FactSet. Like many consumer banks, BofA struggled to grow profits for the last several years due to record low interest rates. Now that the Federal Reserve has started increasing rates, BofA can charge more for loans. --- JP Morgan Chase beats earnings forecasts NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. said its fourth quarter profit rose 24 percent from a year earlier, helped by higher interest rates and strong results from its trading operations. The nation's largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts' forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market's big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. --- Pandora shares up on stronger 4Q outlook, job cut plans NEW YORK (AP) — Pandora has reported a stronger fourth-quarter revenue outlook and announced plans to cut approximately 7 percent of its workforce. Pandora said late Thursday that the job cuts, which would exclude Ticketfly, are being done to help trim overall operating costs. The Oakland, California-based company has been facing increasing competition from Spotify and Apple Inc.'s music service. Pandora anticipates beating its previously announced forecast for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $362 million to $374 million, citing its strong advertising performance. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $369.6 million. --- Liberty is depicted as black woman on $100 gold coin WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Mint has unveiled a commemorative $100 gold coin that features an image of Liberty as a black woman. The 2017 American Liberty 225th Anniversary Gold Coin shows the woman's head in profile with a crown of stars. It features the year of the mint's founding, 1792, as well as the year 2017. The mint says the other side of the coin will depict an eagle in flight. The coin will be released April 6. The Mint says it's the first in a series of 24-karat gold that will also depict Liberty in designs representing Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Indian-Americans. --- Toyota adds 543,000 vehicles to Takata air bag recalls TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. says it is recalling another 543,000 vehicles in the U.S. for defective front passenger air bag inflators made by Japan's Takata Corp. Takata is at the center of a massive recall of inflators that can explode in a crash, spewing metal shrapnel inside the vehicles. Toyota said Friday that the recall includes various models of sedans and SUVs made between 2006 and 2012. Among those recalled are the 2008-2009 Scion xB; 2009 and 2012 Corolla and Corolla Matrix, 2007-2009 and 2012 Toyota Yaris, 2012 4Runner and Sienna and various versions of Lexus made between 2006 and 2012. --- The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The S&P 500 index rose 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq gained 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Tonight Mostly cloudy with periods of light freezing rain after midnight. Low 19F. Winds light and variable. Chance of precip 40%. Updated: January 15, 2017 @ 7:35 pm Full Forecast News Sports Obituaries Opinion Buy & Sell AP Business Highlights By The Associated Press Updated Jan 13, 2017 0 ___ Millennials are falling behind their boomer parents SOUTH MILWAUKEE, Wisconsin (AP) — Baby Boomers: your millennial children are worse off than you. Millennials earn 20 percent less than boomers did at the same stage of life, despite being better educated, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve data by the advocacy group Young Invincibles. The analysis being released Friday gives concrete details about a troubling generational divide that helps to explain much of the anxiety that defined the 2016 election. Millennials have half the net worth of boomers. Their home ownership rate is lower, while their student debt is drastically higher. ___ Takata agrees to guilty plea, will pay $1B for hiding defect DETROIT (AP) — Takata Corp. has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge and will pay $1 billion in fines and restitution for a years-long scheme to conceal a deadly defect in its automotive air bag inflators. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit announced the deal Friday, hours after it unsealed a grand jury indictment against three former Takata executives accused of executing the scheme. Takata inflators can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel into automobiles. At least 11 people have been killed in the U.S. and 16 worldwide because of the defect. More than 180 have been injured. ___ US stock indexes end mostly higher on solid bank earnings Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. ___ More pay, greater confidence lifts US retail sales 0.6 pct. WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans stepped up their auto buying and online shopping in December, reflecting a boost in confidence after the election and a solid increase in pay. Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent, following a small 0.2 percent gain in November, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding autos and gas, retail sales overall were flat. Some economists were disappointed by that figure and said it suggested that many consumers remain cautious. ___ Wells Fargo profit falls after sales practice scandal NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo said Friday its profit fell 5 percent in the first full quarter after regulators said that bank employees opened millions of customer accounts fraudulently to meet sales goals. The scandal has kept new customers away, with the bank reporting that new account openings plummeted last month. In September, regulators fined the San Francisco-based bank $185 million for opening more than two million unauthorized accounts. The scandal brought nationwide attention to the bank, leading to the resignation of the bank's CEO John Stumpf in October. ___ Bank of America tops 4Q profit forecasts Bank of America's fourth-quarter profit jumped 47 percent as the nation's largest consumer bank benefited from higher interest rates and lower expenses.

Joyce M. Rosenberg, AP Business Writer Leave a comment In this Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017, photo, Weberous Web Design CEO Rafael Romis poses for photos in his home, in Los Angeles. When Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) NEW YORK (AP) — When Rafael Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid. “Even if you have a good amount in the bank, it’s not really your money till you pay your taxes,” says Romis, owner of Weberous Web Design. “At the end of the year, it disappeared and we started the new year completely strapped.” Romis, whose company is located in Los Angeles, had to use personal savings to restore Weberous’ cash reserves. “Cash is king” is an axiom business owners try to live by. If revenue isn’t coming in, and owners can’t get loans or investors, there’s no way to run day-to-day operations, buy inventory and equipment or hire workers. But many companies struggle to maintain a healthy cash flow and create a buffer for an event like a storm that keeps customers home. Companies with cash problems often have overestimated how much revenue they’d have and underestimated expenses, says George Solomon, a George Washington University management professor. It’s especially a problem for new owners. These owners may also not be adequately prepared for the seasonality of their business, or for the slow payment practices of their customers — particularly if the customer is a government. “They can literally have millions of dollars on their book in terms of procurement (contracts) for the federal government and literally be filing for bankruptcy,” Solomon says. Businesses like restaurants with low profit margins are particularly at risk of running through their cash buffers, since any interruption to their revenue can put them in danger of closing. Massachusetts restaurants and retailers had a 50 percent drop in revenue between Jan. 26 and Feb. 22, 2015, as massive snowstorms hit the state, according to Boston University researchers. Hidden Boston, a website that tracks restaurant openings and closings, counted 20 restaurants that shut down in the metropolitan area in March 2015, compared to 11 a year earlier and five in March 2013. When JPMorgan Chase & Co. studied 597,000 of its small business customers last year, it found their cash flow was lower than expected. Half the businesses had cash reserves that would last just 27 days. Restaurants had the smallest buffer, 16 days, while repair and maintenance businesses had 18 and retailers had 19. Personal service providers like hairdressers and dry cleaners had 21. The biggest buffer, 47 days, was held by real estate companies. The median small company had an average daily cash balance of $12,100, and personal service providers averaged just $5,300. “The typical small business has a low margin of error in the face of economic headwinds and shocks,” JPMorgan Chase said. Romis says his cash flow has improved as the company has grown, and he now aims to have a two-month cash buffer. If business slows, he’s willing to take on smaller projects — ones that will bring in $8,500 compared to $10,000 for his company’s more typical jobs — to keep cash coming in. He considered using credit cards, but when he took at $7,500 cash advance on a card with a $15,000 credit line, the bank immediately reduced his limit to $7,500, eliminating that alternative. Tate Tullis has learned to bank money during his road sign company’s busy months to give Sign Wise a buffer equal to 20 percent of its annual revenue. The 3-year-old business gets most of its sales during warmer weather, since during the winter fewer roads and parking lots are being built or overhauled. When business drops off, the Logan, Utah, company looks at its inventory and raw materials like aluminum, assesses how much it really needs, and sells the surplus. It also does more marketing to overseas customers. All these steps leave Tullis feeling comfortable with his company’s cash position. “If everything went south, we’d probably have enough cash for two or three months,” he says. The recession taught many business owners some lessons about cash flow, says Thomas Basilo, a certified public accountant with Withum Smith & Brown in Morristown, New Jersey. They’ve given themselves more wiggle room negotiating flexible payment terms with vendors, sometimes as long as 90 days after an invoice is sent. They’ve also gotten better terms from lenders. Many startup owners forgo a salary as a way to boost cash flow. But that’s a sign of trouble to Basilo — they’re not considering all the contingencies that might come up, in their personal lives as well as with their companies. “That’s how they think when they start their business. They’re very unprepared,” he says. Dan and Darla Robinson aim to have $30,000 in cash in the bank by October, to help run their six sweetFrog franchise yogurt shops when sales slow during colder weather. Dan Robinson estimates cash flow falls about 30 percent during the slow months. The Robinsons, whose stores are in California and Maryland, have increased cash flow by cutting expenses, offering fewer toppings and paying off most of their debt. They have a smaller staff during the stores’ down time, and when they need new equipment, they rely on their franchisor’s ability to negotiate better prices. While they do have savings, they don’t want to tap them for cash flow. “We pretend that the savings doesn’t exist,” Dan Robinson says. _____ Follow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

Millennials earn 20 percent less than boomers did at the same stage of life, despite being better educated, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve data by the advocacy group Young Invincibles. The analysis being released Friday gives concrete details about a troubling generational divide that helps to explain much of the anxiety that defined the 2016 election. Millennials have half the net worth of boomers. Their home ownership rate is lower, while their student debt is drastically higher. ___ Takata agrees to guilty plea, will pay $1B for hiding defect DETROIT (AP) — Takata Corp. has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge and will pay $1 billion in fines and restitution for a years-long scheme to conceal a deadly defect in its automotive air bag inflators. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit announced the deal Friday, hours after it unsealed a grand jury indictment against three former Takata executives accused of executing the scheme. Takata inflators can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel into automobiles. At least 11 people have been killed in the U.S. and 16 worldwide because of the defect. More than 180 have been injured. ___ US stock indexes end mostly higher on solid bank earnings Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. ___ More pay, greater confidence lifts US retail sales 0.6 pct. WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans stepped up their auto buying and online shopping in December, reflecting a boost in confidence after the election and a solid increase in pay. Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent, following a small 0.2 percent gain in November, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding autos and gas, retail sales overall were flat. Some economists were disappointed by that figure and said it suggested that many consumers remain cautious. ___ Wells Fargo profit falls after sales practice scandal NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo said Friday its profit fell 5 percent in the first full quarter after regulators said that bank employees opened millions of customer accounts fraudulently to meet sales goals. The scandal has kept new customers away, with the bank reporting that new account openings plummeted last month. In September, regulators fined the San Francisco-based bank $185 million for opening more than two million unauthorized accounts. The scandal brought nationwide attention to the bank, leading to the resignation of the bank's CEO John Stumpf in October. ___ Bank of America tops 4Q profit forecasts Bank of America's fourth-quarter profit jumped 47 percent as the nation's largest consumer bank benefited from higher interest rates and lower expenses. The bank said it earned a profit of $4.34 billion after payments to preferred shareholders, or 40 cents per share, up from $2.95 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results topped analysts' expectations, who were looking for 38 cents per share, according to FactSet. Like many consumer banks, BofA struggled to grow profits for the last several years due to record low interest rates. Now that the Federal Reserve has started increasing rates, BofA can charge more for loans. ___ JP Morgan Chase beats earnings forecasts NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. said its fourth quarter profit rose 24 percent from a year earlier, helped by higher interest rates and strong results from its trading operations. The nation's largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts' forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market's big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Pandora said late Thursday that the job cuts, which would exclude Ticketfly, are being done to help trim overall operating costs. The Oakland, California-based company has been facing increasing competition from Spotify and Apple Inc.'s music service. Pandora anticipates beating its previously announced forecast for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $362 million to $374 million, citing its strong advertising performance. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $369.6 million. ___ Liberty is depicted as black woman on $100 gold coin WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Mint has unveiled a commemorative $100 gold coin that features an image of Liberty as a black woman. The 2017 American Liberty 225th Anniversary Gold Coin shows the woman's head in profile with a crown of stars. It features the year of the mint's founding, 1792, as well as the year 2017. The mint says the other side of the coin will depict an eagle in flight. The coin will be released April 6. The Mint says it's the first in a series of 24-karat gold that will also depict Liberty in designs representing Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Indian-Americans. ___ Toyota adds 543,000 vehicles to Takata air bag recalls TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. says it is recalling another 543,000 vehicles in the U.S. for defective front passenger air bag inflators made by Japan's Takata Corp. Takata is at the center of a massive recall of inflators that can explode in a crash, spewing metal shrapnel inside the vehicles. Toyota said Friday that the recall includes various models of sedans and SUVs made between 2006 and 2012. Among those recalled are the 2008-2009 Scion xB; 2009 and 2012 Corolla and Corolla Matrix, 2007-2009 and 2012 Toyota Yaris, 2012 4Runner and Sienna and various versions of Lexus made between 2006 and 2012. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The S&P 500 index rose 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq gained 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Takata inflators can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel into automobiles. At least 11 people have been killed in the U.S. and 16 worldwide because of the defect. More than 180 have been injured. --- US stock indexes end mostly higher on solid bank earnings Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. --- More pay, greater confidence lifts US retail sales 0.6 pct. WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans stepped up their auto buying and online shopping in December, reflecting a boost in confidence after the election and a solid increase in pay. Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent, following a small 0.2 percent gain in November, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding autos and gas, retail sales overall were flat. Some economists were disappointed by that figure and said it suggested that many consumers remain cautious. --- Wells Fargo profit falls after sales practice scandal NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo said Friday its profit fell 5 percent in the first full quarter after regulators said that bank employees opened millions of customer accounts fraudulently to meet sales goals. The scandal has kept new customers away, with the bank reporting that new account openings plummeted last month. In September, regulators fined the San Francisco-based bank $185 million for opening more than two million unauthorized accounts. The scandal brought nationwide attention to the bank, leading to the resignation of the bank's CEO John Stumpf in October. --- Bank of America tops 4Q profit forecasts Bank of America's fourth-quarter profit jumped 47 percent as the nation's largest consumer bank benefited from higher interest rates and lower expenses. The bank said it earned a profit of $4.34 billion after payments to preferred shareholders, or 40 cents per share, up from $2.95 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results topped analysts' expectations, who were looking for 38 cents per share, according to FactSet. Like many consumer banks, BofA struggled to grow profits for the last several years due to record low interest rates. Now that the Federal Reserve has started increasing rates, BofA can charge more for loans. --- JP Morgan Chase beats earnings forecasts NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. said its fourth quarter profit rose 24 percent from a year earlier, helped by higher interest rates and strong results from its trading operations. The nation's largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts' forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market's big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. --- Pandora shares up on stronger 4Q outlook, job cut plans NEW YORK (AP) — Pandora has reported a stronger fourth-quarter revenue outlook and announced plans to cut approximately 7 percent of its workforce. Pandora said late Thursday that the job cuts, which would exclude Ticketfly, are being done to help trim overall operating costs. The Oakland, California-based company has been facing increasing competition from Spotify and Apple Inc.'s music service. Pandora anticipates beating its previously announced forecast for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $362 million to $374 million, citing its strong advertising performance. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $369.6 million. --- Liberty is depicted as black woman on $100 gold coin WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Mint has unveiled a commemorative $100 gold coin that features an image of Liberty as a black woman. The 2017 American Liberty 225th Anniversary Gold Coin shows the woman's head in profile with a crown of stars. It features the year of the mint's founding, 1792, as well as the year 2017. The mint says the other side of the coin will depict an eagle in flight. The coin will be released April 6. The Mint says it's the first in a series of 24-karat gold that will also depict Liberty in designs representing Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Indian-Americans. --- Toyota adds 543,000 vehicles to Takata air bag recalls TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. says it is recalling another 543,000 vehicles in the U.S. for defective front passenger air bag inflators made by Japan's Takata Corp. Takata is at the center of a massive recall of inflators that can explode in a crash, spewing metal shrapnel inside the vehicles. Toyota said Friday that the recall includes various models of sedans and SUVs made between 2006 and 2012. Among those recalled are the 2008-2009 Scion xB; 2009 and 2012 Corolla and Corolla Matrix, 2007-2009 and 2012 Toyota Yaris, 2012 4Runner and Sienna and various versions of Lexus made between 2006 and 2012. --- The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The S&P 500 index rose 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq gained 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Millennials earn 20 per cent less than boomers did at the same stage of life, despite being better educated, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve data by the advocacy group Young Invincibles. The analysis being released Friday gives concrete details about a troubling generational divide that helps to explain much of the anxiety that defined the 2016 election. Millennials have half the net worth of boomers. Their home ownership rate is lower, while their student debt is drastically higher. ___ Takata agrees to guilty plea, will pay $1B for hiding defect DETROIT (AP) — Takata Corp. has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge and will pay $1 billion in fines and restitution for a years-long scheme to conceal a deadly defect in its automotive air bag inflators.

Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. "We all thought financials would do well," said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. "Now how about the other areas of the economy?" The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $86.70. Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 percent overall in December, mainly due to a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. "If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it's not an impressive number," Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp., home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid $3.82, or 4.1 percent, to $89.31. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $44.20. Gap shed 34 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $23.66. Traders also had their eye on companies that issued outlooks for their upcoming earnings reports. Pandora Media climbed 6.3 percent after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7 percent of its jobs to reduce costs. The stock added 76 cents to $12.765. HomeStreet fell 6 percent after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid $1.85 to $29.10. GameStop tumbled 8.1 percent after the video game retailer said holiday revenue dropped because of discounts and weak sales of new "Call of Duty" and "Titanfall" games. The stock shed $1.99 to $22.73. Energy prices were mixed. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. The slide in crude prices helped pull down shares in energy sector stocks. Oilfield services company Baker Hughes slid $1.50, or 2.4 percent, to $60.92, while drilling services company Transocean lost 36 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.48. Marathon Petroleum fell 87 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $48.38. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet. Major stock indexes in Europe closed higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.9 percent, while France's CAC 40 gained 1.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent. Earlier in Asia, some markets finished lower on disappointing trade data from China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8 percent. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 0.8 percent. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.39 percent from 2.36 percent late Thursday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.42 yen from 114.63 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.0646 from $1.0626. The price of gold fell $3.60 to $1,196.20 an ounce. Silver slid 6 cents to $16.77 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.69 a pound.

VIDEOS TOP JOBS "We all thought financials would do well," said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. "Now how about the other areas of the economy?" The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo.

Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 percent overall in December, mainly due to a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. "If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it's not an impressive number," Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains.

Pandora Media climbed 6.3 percent after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7 percent of its jobs to reduce costs. The stock added 76 cents to $12.765. HomeStreet fell 6 percent after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid $1.85 to $29.10. GameStop tumbled 8.1 percent after the video game retailer said holiday revenue dropped because of discounts and weak sales of new "Call of Duty" and "Titanfall" games.

Millennials earn 20 percent less than boomers did at the same stage of life, despite being better educated, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve data by the advocacy group Young Invincibles. The analysis being released Friday gives concrete details about a troubling generational divide that helps to explain much of the anxiety that defined the 2016 election. Millennials have half the net worth of boomers. Their home ownership rate is lower, while their student debt is drastically higher. ___ Takata agrees to guilty plea, will pay $1B for hiding defect DETROIT (AP) — Takata Corp. has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge and will pay $1 billion in fines and restitution for a years-long scheme to conceal a deadly defect in its automotive air bag inflators. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Detroit announced the deal Friday, hours after it unsealed a grand jury indictment against three former Takata executives accused of executing the scheme. Takata inflators can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel into automobiles. At least 11 people have been killed in the U.S. and 16 worldwide because of the defect. More than 180 have been injured. ___ US stock indexes end mostly higher on solid bank earnings Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week.

[auth] Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. ___ More pay, greater confidence lifts US retail sales 0.6 pct. WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans stepped up their auto buying and online shopping in December, reflecting a boost in confidence after the election and a solid increase in pay. Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent, following a small 0.2 percent gain in November, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding autos and gas, retail sales overall were flat. Some economists were disappointed by that figure and said it suggested that many consumers remain cautious. ___ Wells Fargo profit falls after sales practice scandal NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo said Friday its profit fell 5 percent in the first full quarter after regulators said that bank employees opened millions of customer accounts fraudulently to meet sales goals. The scandal has kept new customers away, with the bank reporting that new account openings plummeted last month. In September, regulators fined the San Francisco-based bank $185 million for opening more than two million unauthorized accounts. The scandal brought nationwide attention to the bank, leading to the resignation of the bank’s CEO John Stumpf in October. ___ Bank of America tops 4Q profit forecasts Bank of America’s fourth-quarter profit jumped 47 percent as the nation’s largest consumer bank benefited from higher interest rates and lower expenses. The bank said it earned a profit of $4.34 billion after payments to preferred shareholders, or 40 cents per share, up from $2.95 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results topped analysts’ expectations, who were looking for 38 cents per share, according to FactSet. Like many consumer banks, BofA struggled to grow profits for the last several years due to record low interest rates. Now that the Federal Reserve has started increasing rates, BofA can charge more for loans. ___ JP Morgan Chase beats earnings forecasts NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. said its fourth quarter profit rose 24 percent from a year earlier, helped by higher interest rates and strong results from its trading operations. The nation’s largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts’ forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market’s big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. ___ Pandora shares up on stronger 4Q outlook, job cut plans NEW YORK (AP) — Pandora has reported a stronger fourth-quarter revenue outlook and announced plans to cut approximately 7 percent of its workforce. Pandora said late Thursday that the job cuts, which would exclude Ticketfly, are being done to help trim overall operating costs. The Oakland, California-based company has been facing increasing competition from Spotify and Apple Inc.’s music service. Pandora anticipates beating its previously announced forecast for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $362 million to $374 million, citing its strong advertising performance. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $369.6 million. ___ Liberty is depicted as black woman on $100 gold coin WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Mint has unveiled a commemorative $100 gold coin that features an image of Liberty as a black woman. The 2017 American Liberty 225th Anniversary Gold Coin shows the woman’s head in profile with a crown of stars. It features the year of the mint’s founding, 1792, as well as the year 2017. The mint says the other side of the coin will depict an eagle in flight. The coin will be released April 6. The Mint says it’s the first in a series of 24-karat gold that will also depict Liberty in designs representing Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Indian-Americans. ___ Toyota adds 543,000 vehicles to Takata air bag recalls TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. says it is recalling another 543,000 vehicles in the U.S. for defective front passenger air bag inflators made by Japan’s Takata Corp. Takata is at the center of a massive recall of inflators that can explode in a crash, spewing metal shrapnel inside the vehicles. Toyota said Friday that the recall includes various models of sedans and SUVs made between 2006 and 2012. Among those recalled are the 2008-2009 Scion xB; 2009 and 2012 Corolla and Corolla Matrix, 2007-2009 and 2012 Toyota Yaris, 2012 4Runner and Sienna and various versions of Lexus made between 2006 and 2012. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The S&P 500 index rose 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq gained 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12.

Millennials earn 20 percent less than boomers did at the same stage of life, despite being better educated, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve data by the advocacy group Young Invincibles. The analysis being released Friday gives concrete details about a troubling generational divide that helps to explain much of the anxiety that defined the 2016 election. Millennials have half the net worth of boomers. Their home ownership rate is lower, while their student debt is drastically higher. ___ Takata agrees to guilty plea, will pay $1B for hiding defect DETROIT (AP) " Takata Corp. has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge and will pay $1 billion in fines and restitution for a years-long scheme to conceal a deadly defect in its automotive air bag inflators. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit announced the deal Friday, hours after it unsealed a grand jury indictment against three former Takata executives accused of executing the scheme. Takata inflators can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel into automobiles. At least 11 people have been killed in the U.S. and 16 worldwide because of the defect. More than 180 have been injured. ___ US stock indexes end mostly higher on solid bank earnings Continued below. Related Content Summer Job: Spark chief executive Simon Moutter Cartoon: Another Kiwi classic - Household debt National election promise to create recreational fishing-only zones running behind schedule Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. ___ More pay, greater confidence lifts US retail sales 0.6 pct. WASHINGTON (AP) " Americans stepped up their auto buying and online shopping in December, reflecting a boost in confidence after the election and a solid increase in pay. Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent, following a small 0.2 percent gain in November, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding autos and gas, retail sales overall were flat. Some economists were disappointed by that figure and said it suggested that many consumers remain cautious. ___ Wells Fargo profit falls after sales practice scandal NEW YORK (AP) " Wells Fargo said Friday its profit fell 5 percent in the first full quarter after regulators said that bank employees opened millions of customer accounts fraudulently to meet sales goals. The scandal has kept new customers away, with the bank reporting that new account openings plummeted last month. In September, regulators fined the San Francisco-based bank $185 million for opening more than two million unauthorized accounts. The scandal brought nationwide attention to the bank, leading to the resignation of the bank's CEO John Stumpf in October. ___ Bank of America tops 4Q profit forecasts Bank of America's fourth-quarter profit jumped 47 percent as the nation's largest consumer bank benefited from higher interest rates and lower expenses. The bank said it earned a profit of $4.34 billion after payments to preferred shareholders, or 40 cents per share, up from $2.95 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results topped analysts' expectations, who were looking for 38 cents per share, according to FactSet. Like many consumer banks, BofA struggled to grow profits for the last several years due to record low interest rates. Now that the Federal Reserve has started increasing rates, BofA can charge more for loans. ___ JP Morgan Chase beats earnings forecasts NEW YORK (AP) " JPMorgan Chase & Co. said its fourth quarter profit rose 24 percent from a year earlier, helped by higher interest rates and strong results from its trading operations. The nation's largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts' forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market's big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. ___ Pandora shares up on stronger 4Q outlook, job cut plans NEW YORK (AP) " Pandora has reported a stronger fourth-quarter revenue outlook and announced plans to cut approximately 7 percent of its workforce. Pandora said late Thursday that the job cuts, which would exclude Ticketfly, are being done to help trim overall operating costs. The Oakland, California-based company has been facing increasing competition from Spotify and Apple Inc.'s music service. Pandora anticipates beating its previously announced forecast for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $362 million to $374 million, citing its strong advertising performance. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $369.6 million. ___ Liberty is depicted as black woman on $100 gold coin WASHINGTON (AP) " The U.S. Mint has unveiled a commemorative $100 gold coin that features an image of Liberty as a black woman. The 2017 American Liberty 225th Anniversary Gold Coin shows the woman's head in profile with a crown of stars. It features the year of the mint's founding, 1792, as well as the year 2017. The mint says the other side of the coin will depict an eagle in flight. The coin will be released April 6. The Mint says it's the first in a series of 24-karat gold that will also depict Liberty in designs representing Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Indian-Americans. ___ Toyota adds 543,000 vehicles to Takata air bag recalls TOKYO (AP) " Toyota Motor Corp. says it is recalling another 543,000 vehicles in the U.S. for defective front passenger air bag inflators made by Japan's Takata Corp. Takata is at the center of a massive recall of inflators that can explode in a crash, spewing metal shrapnel inside the vehicles. Toyota said Friday that the recall includes various models of sedans and SUVs made between 2006 and 2012. Among those recalled are the 2008-2009 Scion xB; 2009 and 2012 Corolla and Corolla Matrix, 2007-2009 and 2012 Toyota Yaris, 2012 4Runner and Sienna and various versions of Lexus made between 2006 and 2012. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The S&P 500 index rose 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq gained 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. "We all thought financials would do well," said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. "Now how about the other areas of the economy?" The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $86.70. Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 percent overall in December, mainly due to a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. "If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it's not an impressive number," Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp., home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid $3.82, or 4.1 percent, to $89.31. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $44.20. Gap shed 34 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $23.66. Traders also had their eye on companies that issued outlooks for their upcoming earnings reports. Pandora Media climbed 6.3 percent after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7 percent of its jobs to reduce costs. The stock added 76 cents to $12.765. HomeStreet fell 6 percent after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid $1.85 to $29.10. GameStop tumbled 8.1 percent after the video game retailer said holiday revenue dropped because of discounts and weak sales of new "Call of Duty" and "Titanfall" games. The stock shed $1.99 to $22.73. Energy prices were mixed. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. The slide in crude prices helped pull down shares in energy sector stocks. Oilfield services company Baker Hughes slid $1.50, or 2.4 percent, to $60.92, while drilling services company Transocean lost 36 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.48. Marathon Petroleum fell 87 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $48.38. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet. Major stock indexes in Europe closed higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.9 percent, while France's CAC 40 gained 1.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent. Earlier in Asia, some markets finished lower on disappointing trade data from China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8 percent. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 0.8 percent. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.39 percent from 2.36 percent late Thursday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.42 yen from 114.63 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.0646 from $1.0626. The price of gold fell $3.60 to $1,196.20 an ounce. Silver slid 6 cents to $16.77 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.69 a pound.

Millennials earn 20 percent less than boomers did at the same stage of life, despite being better educated, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve data by the advocacy group Young Invincibles. The analysis being released Friday gives concrete details about a troubling generational divide that helps to explain much of the anxiety that defined the 2016 election. Millennials have half the net worth of boomers. Their home ownership rate is lower, while their student debt is drastically higher. ___ Takata agrees to guilty plea, will pay $1B for hiding defect DETROIT (AP) — Takata Corp. has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge and will pay $1 billion in fines and restitution for a years-long scheme to conceal a deadly defect in its automotive air bag inflators. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit announced the deal Friday, hours after it unsealed a grand jury indictment against three former Takata executives accused of executing the scheme. Takata inflators can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel into automobiles. At least 11 people have been killed in the U.S. and 16 worldwide because of the defect. More than 180 have been injured. ___ US stock indexes end mostly higher on solid bank earnings Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. ___ More pay, greater confidence lifts US retail sales 0.6 pct. WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans stepped up their auto buying and online shopping in December, reflecting a boost in confidence after the election and a solid increase in pay. Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent, following a small 0.2 percent gain in November, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding autos and gas, retail sales overall were flat. Some economists were disappointed by that figure and said it suggested that many consumers remain cautious. ___ Wells Fargo profit falls after sales practice scandal NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo said Friday its profit fell 5 percent in the first full quarter after regulators said that bank employees opened millions of customer accounts fraudulently to meet sales goals. The scandal has kept new customers away, with the bank reporting that new account openings plummeted last month. In September, regulators fined the San Francisco-based bank $185 million for opening more than two million unauthorized accounts. The scandal brought nationwide attention to the bank, leading to the resignation of the bank's CEO John Stumpf in October. ___ Bank of America tops 4Q profit forecasts Bank of America's fourth-quarter profit jumped 47 percent as the nation's largest consumer bank benefited from higher interest rates and lower expenses. The bank said it earned a profit of $4.34 billion after payments to preferred shareholders, or 40 cents per share, up from $2.95 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results topped analysts' expectations, who were looking for 38 cents per share, according to FactSet. Like many consumer banks, BofA struggled to grow profits for the last several years due to record low interest rates. Now that the Federal Reserve has started increasing rates, BofA can charge more for loans. ___ JP Morgan Chase beats earnings forecasts NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. said its fourth quarter profit rose 24 percent from a year earlier, helped by higher interest rates and strong results from its trading operations. The nation's largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts' forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market's big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. ___ Pandora shares up on stronger 4Q outlook, job cut plans NEW YORK (AP) — Pandora has reported a stronger fourth-quarter revenue outlook and announced plans to cut approximately 7 percent of its workforce. Pandora said late Thursday that the job cuts, which would exclude Ticketfly, are being done to help trim overall operating costs. The Oakland, California-based company has been facing increasing competition from Spotify and Apple Inc.'s music service. Pandora anticipates beating its previously announced forecast for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $362 million to $374 million, citing its strong advertising performance. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $369.6 million. ___ Liberty is depicted as black woman on $100 gold coin WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Mint has unveiled a commemorative $100 gold coin that features an image of Liberty as a black woman. The 2017 American Liberty 225th Anniversary Gold Coin shows the woman's head in profile with a crown of stars. It features the year of the mint's founding, 1792, as well as the year 2017. The mint says the other side of the coin will depict an eagle in flight. The coin will be released April 6. The Mint says it's the first in a series of 24-karat gold that will also depict Liberty in designs representing Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Indian-Americans. ___ Toyota adds 543,000 vehicles to Takata air bag recalls TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. says it is recalling another 543,000 vehicles in the U.S. for defective front passenger air bag inflators made by Japan's Takata Corp. Takata is at the center of a massive recall of inflators that can explode in a crash, spewing metal shrapnel inside the vehicles. Toyota said Friday that the recall includes various models of sedans and SUVs made between 2006 and 2012. Among those recalled are the 2008-2009 Scion xB; 2009 and 2012 Corolla and Corolla Matrix, 2007-2009 and 2012 Toyota Yaris, 2012 4Runner and Sienna and various versions of Lexus made between 2006 and 2012.

Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. "We all thought financials would do well," said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. "Now how about the other areas of the economy?" The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $86.70. Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 percent overall in December, mainly due to a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. "If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it's not an impressive number," Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp., home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid $3.82, or 4.1 percent, to $89.31. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $44.20. Gap shed 34 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $23.66. Traders also had their eye on companies that issued outlooks for their upcoming earnings reports. Pandora Media climbed 6.3 percent after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7 percent of its jobs to reduce costs. The stock added 76 cents to $12.765. HomeStreet fell 6 percent after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid $1.85 to $29.10. GameStop tumbled 8.1 percent after the video game retailer said holiday revenue dropped because of discounts and weak sales of new "Call of Duty" and "Titanfall" games. The stock shed $1.99 to $22.73. Energy prices were mixed. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. The slide in crude prices helped pull down shares in energy sector stocks. Oilfield services company Baker Hughes slid $1.50, or 2.4 percent, to $60.92, while drilling services company Transocean lost 36 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.48. Marathon Petroleum fell 87 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $48.38. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet. Major stock indexes in Europe closed higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.9 percent, while France's CAC 40 gained 1.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent. Earlier in Asia, some markets finished lower on disappointing trade data from China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8 percent. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 0.8 percent. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.39 percent from 2.36 percent late Thursday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.42 yen from 114.63 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.0646 from $1.0626. The price of gold fell $3.60 to $1,196.20 an ounce. Silver slid 6 cents to $16.77 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.69 a pound.

Millennials earn 20 percent less than boomers did at the same stage of life, despite being better educated, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve data by the advocacy group Young Invincibles. The analysis being released Friday gives concrete details about a troubling generational divide that helps to explain much of the anxiety that defined the 2016 election. Millennials have half the net worth of boomers. Their home ownership rate is lower, while their student debt is drastically higher. ___ Takata agrees to guilty plea, will pay $1B for hiding defect DETROIT (AP) — Takata Corp. has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge and will pay $1 billion in fines and restitution for a years-long scheme to conceal a deadly defect in its automotive air bag inflators. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Detroit announced the deal Friday, hours after it unsealed a grand jury indictment against three former Takata executives accused of executing the scheme. Takata inflators can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel into automobiles. At least 11 people have been killed in the U.S. and 16 worldwide because of the defect. More than 180 have been injured. ___ US stock indexes end mostly higher on solid bank earnings Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. ___ More pay, greater confidence lifts US retail sales 0.6 pct. WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans stepped up their auto buying and online shopping in December, reflecting a boost in confidence after the election and a solid increase in pay. Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent, following a small 0.2 percent gain in November, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding autos and gas, retail sales overall were flat. Some economists were disappointed by that figure and said it suggested that many consumers remain cautious. ___ Wells Fargo profit falls after sales practice scandal NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo said Friday its profit fell 5 percent in the first full quarter after regulators said that bank employees opened millions of customer accounts fraudulently to meet sales goals. The scandal has kept new customers away, with the bank reporting that new account openings plummeted last month. In September, regulators fined the San Francisco-based bank $185 million for opening more than two million unauthorized accounts. The scandal brought nationwide attention to the bank, leading to the resignation of the bank's CEO John Stumpf in October. ___ Bank of America tops 4Q profit forecasts Bank of America's fourth-quarter profit jumped 47 percent as the nation's largest consumer bank benefited from higher interest rates and lower expenses. The bank said it earned a profit of $4.34 billion after payments to preferred shareholders, or 40 cents per share, up from $2.95 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results topped analysts' expectations, who were looking for 38 cents per share, according to FactSet. Like many consumer banks, BofA struggled to grow profits for the last several years due to record low interest rates. Now that the Federal Reserve has started increasing rates, BofA can charge more for loans. ___ JP Morgan Chase beats earnings forecasts NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. said its fourth quarter profit rose 24 percent from a year earlier, helped by higher interest rates and strong results from its trading operations. The nation's largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts' forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market's big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. ___ Pandora shares up on stronger 4Q outlook, job cut plans NEW YORK (AP) — Pandora has reported a stronger fourth-quarter revenue outlook and announced plans to cut approximately 7 percent of its workforce. Pandora said late Thursday that the job cuts, which would exclude Ticketfly, are being done to help trim overall operating costs. The Oakland, California-based company has been facing increasing competition from Spotify and Apple Inc.'s music service. Pandora anticipates beating its previously announced forecast for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $362 million to $374 million, citing its strong advertising performance. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $369.6 million. ___ Liberty is depicted as black woman on $100 gold coin WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Mint has unveiled a commemorative $100 gold coin that features an image of Liberty as a black woman.

The mint says the other side of the coin will depict an eagle in flight. The coin will be released April 6. The Mint says it's the first in a series of 24-karat gold that will also depict Liberty in designs representing Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Indian-Americans. ___ Toyota adds 543,000 vehicles to Takata air bag recalls TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. says it is recalling another 543,000 vehicles in the U.S. for defective front passenger air bag inflators made by Japan's Takata Corp. Takata is at the center of a massive recall of inflators that can explode in a crash, spewing metal shrapnel inside the vehicles. Toyota said Friday that the recall includes various models of sedans and SUVs made between 2006 and 2012. Among those recalled are the 2008-2009 Scion xB; 2009 and 2012 Corolla and Corolla Matrix, 2007-2009 and 2012 Toyota Yaris, 2012 4Runner and Sienna and various versions of Lexus made between 2006 and 2012. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73.

Millennials earn 20 percent less than boomers did at the same stage of life, despite being better educated, according to a new analysis of Federal Reserve data by the advocacy group Young Invincibles.

Seattle will have own women’s march Man arrested after Bellevue mosque damaged in suspected arson  VIEW Seattle’s Mayor Murray kills city-run bike-share programUnlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. The analysis being released Friday gives concrete details about a troubling generational divide that helps to explain much of the anxiety that defined the 2016 election. Millennials have half the net worth of boomers. Their home ownership rate is lower, while their student debt is drastically higher. ___ Takata agrees to guilty plea, will pay $1B for hiding defect DETROIT (AP) — Takata Corp. has agreed to plead guilty to a single criminal charge and will pay $1 billion in fines and restitution for a years-long scheme to conceal a deadly defect in its automotive air bag inflators. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Detroit announced the deal Friday, hours after it unsealed a grand jury indictment against three former Takata executives accused of executing the scheme. Takata inflators can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel into automobiles. At least 11 people have been killed in the U.S. and 16 worldwide because of the defect. More than 180 have been injured. ___ US stock indexes end mostly higher on solid bank earnings Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. ___ More pay, greater confidence lifts US retail sales 0.6 pct. WASHINGTON (AP) — Americans stepped up their auto buying and online shopping in December, reflecting a boost in confidence after the election and a solid increase in pay. Retail sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent, following a small 0.2 percent gain in November, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding autos and gas, retail sales overall were flat. Some economists were disappointed by that figure and said it suggested that many consumers remain cautious. ___ Wells Fargo profit falls after sales practice scandal NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo said Friday its profit fell 5 percent in the first full quarter after regulators said that bank employees opened millions of customer accounts fraudulently to meet sales goals. The scandal has kept new customers away, with the bank reporting that new account openings plummeted last month. In September, regulators fined the San Francisco-based bank $185 million for opening more than two million unauthorized accounts. The scandal brought nationwide attention to the bank, leading to the resignation of the bank’s CEO John Stumpf in October. ___ Bank of America tops 4Q profit forecasts Bank of America’s fourth-quarter profit jumped 47 percent as the nation’s largest consumer bank benefited from higher interest rates and lower expenses. The bank said it earned a profit of $4.34 billion after payments to preferred shareholders, or 40 cents per share, up from $2.95 billion, or 27 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The results topped analysts’ expectations, who were looking for 38 cents per share, according to FactSet. Like many consumer banks, BofA struggled to grow profits for the last several years due to record low interest rates. Now that the Federal Reserve has started increasing rates, BofA can charge more for loans. ___ JP Morgan Chase beats earnings forecasts NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. said its fourth quarter profit rose 24 percent from a year earlier, helped by higher interest rates and strong results from its trading operations. The nation’s largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts’ forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market’s big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. ___ Pandora shares up on stronger 4Q outlook, job cut plans NEW YORK (AP) — Pandora has reported a stronger fourth-quarter revenue outlook and announced plans to cut approximately 7 percent of its workforce. Pandora said late Thursday that the job cuts, which would exclude Ticketfly, are being done to help trim overall operating costs. The Oakland, California-based company has been facing increasing competition from Spotify and Apple Inc.’s music service. Pandora anticipates beating its previously announced forecast for fourth-quarter revenue in a range of $362 million to $374 million, citing its strong advertising performance. Analysts polled by FactSet expect $369.6 million. ___ Liberty is depicted as black woman on $100 gold coin WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. Mint has unveiled a commemorative $100 gold coin that features an image of Liberty as a black woman. The 2017 American Liberty 225th Anniversary Gold Coin shows the woman’s head in profile with a crown of stars. It features the year of the mint’s founding, 1792, as well as the year 2017. The mint says the other side of the coin will depict an eagle in flight. The coin will be released April 6. The Mint says it’s the first in a series of 24-karat gold that will also depict Liberty in designs representing Asian-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and Indian-Americans. ___ Toyota adds 543,000 vehicles to Takata air bag recalls TOKYO (AP) — Toyota Motor Corp. says it is recalling another 543,000 vehicles in the U.S. for defective front passenger air bag inflators made by Japan’s Takata Corp. Takata is at the center of a massive recall of inflators that can explode in a crash, spewing metal shrapnel inside the vehicles. Toyota said Friday that the recall includes various models of sedans and SUVs made between 2006 and 2012.

The S&P 500 index rose 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq gained 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12.

Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on US retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03%, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2%, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5%, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8%, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5%, to 86.70 dollars. Bank of America rose nine cents, or 0.4%, to 23.01 dollars. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5%, to 55.31 dollars. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of US retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6% overall in December, mainly due to a pick-up in online shopping and sales of vehicles and petrol. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp, home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid 3.82 dollars, or 4.1%, to 89.31 dollars. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8%, to 44.20 dollars.

The stock added 76 cents to 12.765 dollars. HomeStreet fell 6% after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid 1.85 dollars to 29.10 dollars.

Britain intercepted, deciphered and shared the "Zimmermann Telegram."More >    By ALEX VEIGA AP Business Writer Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. "We all thought financials would do well," said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. "Now how about the other areas of the economy?" The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $86.70. Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 percent overall in December, mainly due to a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. "If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it's not an impressive number," Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp., home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid $3.82, or 4.1 percent, to $89.31. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $44.20. Gap shed 34 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $23.66. Traders also had their eye on companies that issued outlooks for their upcoming earnings reports. Pandora Media climbed 6.3 percent after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7 percent of its jobs to reduce costs. The stock added 76 cents to $12.765. HomeStreet fell 6 percent after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid $1.85 to $29.10. GameStop tumbled 8.1 percent after the video game retailer said holiday revenue dropped because of discounts and weak sales of new "Call of Duty" and "Titanfall" games. The stock shed $1.99 to $22.73. Energy prices were mixed. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. The slide in crude prices helped pull down shares in energy sector stocks. Oilfield services company Baker Hughes slid $1.50, or 2.4 percent, to $60.92, while drilling services company Transocean lost 36 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.48. Marathon Petroleum fell 87 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $48.38. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet. Major stock indexes in Europe closed higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.9 percent, while France's CAC 40 gained 1.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent. Earlier in Asia, some markets finished lower on disappointing trade data from China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8 percent. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 0.8 percent. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.39 percent from 2.36 percent late Thursday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.42 yen from 114.63 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.0646 from $1.0626. The price of gold fell $3.60 to $1,196.20 an ounce. Silver slid 6 cents to $16.77 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.69 a pound.

As expected, commentary on what the investment community really wanted to hear — 2017 guidance — was light. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon did say, "The U.S. economy may be building momentum. Looking ahead, there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth, create jobs for Americans across the income spectrum and help communities, and we are well positioned to play our part." On the conference call, Dimon, when asked about signs of that "building momentum," characteristically downplayed forecasting, saying "we don't react that much to the weather." But he said he was basing his observation "on a broad range of things, and it looks like growth may have done a little better in the fourth quarter, plus if you take a walk around the world, Japan's doing a little bit better, Europe's doing a little bit better. ..." As for the issue on everyone's mind — tax cuts and fewer regulations — Dimon said that regulatory relief may help banks open new branches and seek out clients they don't have "so I'm hoping you'll see a little bit of that." A lower tax rate would be "good for growth in the country in general." The bottom line on the impact of lower taxes and less regulation: "You have to see the whole package before you can see what the net impact is, but ultimately ... it's good for our franchise broadly." CFO Marianne Lake said the bank would provide details on 2017 guidance at its Investor Day, which is scheduled for Feb. 28. Bank of America's CFO Paul Donofrio said, "While the recent rise in interest rates came too late to impact fourth-quarter results, we expect to see a significant increase in net interest income in the first quarter of 2017." While they did not give guidance about how the combination of lower taxes and less regulations might impact earnings, Mr. Donofrio said they expected a similar tax rate of 31 percent for the average for 2017 excluding unusual items.

For just $0.75 you can get full site access today. Click Here Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. "We all thought financials would do well," said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. "Now how about the other areas of the economy?" The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $86.70. Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 percent overall in December, mainly due to a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. "If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it's not an impressive number," Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp., home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid $3.82, or 4.1 percent, to $89.31. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $44.20. Gap shed 34 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $23.66. Traders also had their eye on companies that issued outlooks for their upcoming earnings reports. Pandora Media climbed 6.3 percent after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7 percent of its jobs to reduce costs. The stock added 76 cents to $12.765. HomeStreet fell 6 percent after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid $1.85 to $29.10. GameStop tumbled 8.1 percent after the video game retailer said holiday revenue dropped because of discounts and weak sales of new "Call of Duty" and "Titanfall" games. The stock shed $1.99 to $22.73. Energy prices were mixed. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. The slide in crude prices helped pull down shares in energy sector stocks. Oilfield services company Baker Hughes slid $1.50, or 2.4 percent, to $60.92, while drilling services company Transocean lost 36 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.48. Marathon Petroleum fell 87 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $48.38. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet. Major stock indexes in Europe closed higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.9 percent, while France's CAC 40 gained 1.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent. Earlier in Asia, some markets finished lower on disappointing trade data from China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8 percent. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 0.8 percent. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.39 percent from 2.36 percent late Thursday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.42 yen from 114.63 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.0646 from $1.0626. The price of gold fell $3.60 to $1,196.20 an ounce. Silver slid 6 cents to $16.77 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.69 a pound.

JP Morgan Chase's net income rose 24 percent to $6.73 billion, from $5.43 billion the same quarter of 2015. Revenues were also up 2.4 percent to $24.33 billion during the October-December period of 2016, from $23.75 billion the same period in the previous year. After the release of the results, share value of JP Morgan Chase increased 1.6 percent on Wall Street to as high as $87.95. At Bank of America, net income increased 43 percent to $4.69 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016, which was up from $3.28 billion from the same quarter the previous year. Revenues also increased, by 2.1 percent, to reach $19.99 billion from $19.58 billion during the same period. Shares of the bank gained 1.7 percent to $23.32 in the stock market after positive results. Stirred with illegal banking activities, Wells Fargo's earnings were highly anticipated. The bank said Friday its net income fell 5.3 percent to $5.3 billion in fourth quarter of 2016, from $5.6 billion the same quarter of 2015.  Revenues remained unchanged at $21.6 billion year-over-year. Despite the decline in net income, Wells Fargo earnings beat market expectations, which expected the bank to post less profits. Wells Fargo stock price gained 2.4 percent Friday morning to reach $56.01 in the stock market. "We continued to make progress in the fourth quarter in rebuilding the trust of our customers, team members and other key stakeholders," President and CEO Tim Sloan said in a statement, and added the bank is "fulfilling our regulatory requirements for sales practices matters." The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a $185 million fine in September for the illegal banking practices at Wells Fargo that dated to 2011, after employees opened millions of accounts and applied for half a million credit card accounts that were not authorized by customers, in order to boost sales figures and meet sales targets. Wells Fargo fired 5,300 of its employees involved in the scandal. Then-CEO John Stumpf agreed in September to forfeit his equity awards valued at $41 million and retired from the company.

Morgan Chase and Bank of America shares peaked at multidecade highs two months ago Everett Collection In 1976’s “Marathon Man,” Laurence Olivier (L) asks Dustin Hoffman (R), “Is it safe?” By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor If you’re wondering if it’s still safe to buy bank stocks, as earnings beats pushed J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. shares into record territory Friday, a bearish pattern in the charts suggests don’t do it — at least not for a while. J.P. Morgan’s stock JPM, +0.53%  closed up 0.5% on Friday, paring earlier gains of as much as 2.2% to an all-time intraday high of $88.17. The blue-chip bank reported before the market opened fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surged past expectations. B. of A.’s stock BAC, +0.39%  tacked on 0.4%, but was up 2.1% at a more than 8-year high of $23.41 earlier, as better-than-expected earnings offset a revenue miss. See also: The Trump question and 4 other things to know about this earnings season. Technicians like to say that there is nothing more bullish than a new high, unless of course the underlying technical indicators fail to validate the gains, which is a condition referred to as “bearish divergence.” And for the stocks of both JPMorgan and B. of A., a closely watched measure of momentum have actually been trending lower the past two months. FactSet For JPMorgan, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator that tracks how the magnitude of recent price gains compare with the magnitude of declines, reached an all-time high of 87.42 on Nov. 14. Many chart watchers view readings above 70 as suggesting an overbought condition. Although the stock has run up 9% since then, amid optimism over President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-business and antiregulation policy promises, the RSI has declined to 62.60 on Friday. B. of A’s RSI peaked at a 34-year high of 88.57 on Nov. 15, and has since fallen to 62.86 despite a 14% surge in the stock price. FactSet The SPDR Financial Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLF, +0.56% which houses both stocks, is also suffering from a bearish technical divergence. Don’t miss: Financial ETF nears highest level since 2008 after bullish bank results. Contrary to popular belief, overbought readings don’t mean a stock’s rally is close to over. As Constance Brown so proficiently pointed out in “Technical Analysis for the Trading Professional,” the ability to become overbought is actually a bullish sign. What can be bearish, however, is when technical oscillators such as RSI, which travel between zero and 100, fall below their overbought thresholds, and are unable to cross back above them despite continued gains in the stock price. Although JPMorgan and B. of A. shares have run up to new long-term intraday highs on Friday, JPMorgan’s RSI hasn’t peeked above 70 since Jan. 3, and B. of A.’s RSI hasn’t been above 70 since Dec. 15. Bearish divergences don’t always lead to long-term or even medium-term price tops, but they can, so they warn investors to wait until prices and technicals start telling the same story again. FactSet The sharp selloff in bank stocks in early 2014—JPMorgan’s tumbled 13% from late March to mid May that year and B. of A.’s plunged 19%—was preceded by bearish RSI divergences, as was JPMorgan’s pre-financial crisis peak in early May 2007 and B. of A.’s peak in late November 2006. For those looking to buy those stocks after a dip, don’t wait for the RSI to fall below the oversold threshold of 30, because if it does, it might suggest a longer-term downtrend may have started. For stocks in bull markets, Brown said “the 40 level is never broken.” FactSet For JPMorgan, some downside stock price levels to watch include the late December low of $85.04, previous resistance around $80.50, and the big one is the price gap between the Nov. 8 high of $70.54 and the Nov. 9 low of $71.32. Potential support levels for B. of A.’s stock include the late December low of $21.77, and the price gaps between Nov. 11 high and Nov. 12 low—$19.03 to $19.40—and between the Nov. 8 high and the Nov. 9 low—$17.10 to $17.40.

Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. "We all thought financials would do well," said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. "Now how about the other areas of the economy?" The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 per cent, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5 per cent, to $86.70. Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 per cent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 per cent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 per cent overall in December, mainly due to a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. "If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it's not an impressive number," Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp., home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid $3.82, or 4.1 per cent, to $89.31. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8 per cent, to $44.20. Gap shed 34 cents, or 1.4 per cent, to $23.66. Traders also had their eye on companies that issued outlooks for their upcoming earnings reports. Pandora Media climbed 6.3 per cent after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7 per cent of its jobs to reduce costs. The stock added 76 cents to $12.765. HomeStreet fell 6 per cent after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid $1.85 to $29.10. GameStop tumbled 8.1 per cent after the video game retailer said holiday revenue dropped because of discounts and weak sales of new "Call of Duty" and "Titanfall" games. The stock shed $1.99 to $22.73. Energy prices were mixed. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 per cent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 per cent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. The slide in crude prices helped pull down shares in energy sector stocks. Oilfield services company Baker Hughes slid $1.50, or 2.4 per cent, to $60.92, while drilling services company Transocean lost 36 cents, or 2.3 per cent, to $15.48. Marathon Petroleum fell 87 cents, or 1.8 per cent, to $48.38. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 per cent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet. Major stock indexes in Europe closed higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.9 per cent, while France's CAC 40 gained 1.2 per cent. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.6 per cent. Earlier in Asia, some markets finished lower on disappointing trade data from China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.5 per cent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8 per cent. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 per cent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 0.8 per cent. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.39 per cent from 2.36 per cent late Thursday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.42 yen from 114.63 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.0646 from $1.0626. The price of gold fell $3.60 to $1,196.20 an ounce. Silver slid 6 cents to $16.77 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.69 a pound.

Morgan Chase and Bank of America shares peaked at multidecade highs two months ago Everett Collection In 1976’s “Marathon Man,” Laurence Olivier (L) asks Dustin Hoffman (R), “Is it safe?” By TomiKilgore Reporter and editor If you’re wondering if it’s still safe to buy bank stocks, as earnings beats pushed J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. shares into record territory Friday, a bearish pattern in the charts suggests don’t do it — at least not for a while. J.P. Morgan’s stock JPM, +0.53%  closed up 0.5% on Friday, paring earlier gains of as much as 2.2% to an all-time intraday high of $88.17. The blue-chip bank reported before the market opened fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surged past expectations. B. of A.’s stock BAC, +0.39%  tacked on 0.4%, but was up 2.1% at a more than 8-year high of $23.41 earlier, as better-than-expected earnings offset a revenue miss. See also: The Trump question and 4 other things to know about this earnings season. Technicians like to say that there is nothing more bullish than a new high, unless of course the underlying technical indicators fail to validate the gains, which is a condition referred to as “bearish divergence.” And for the stocks of both JPMorgan and B. of A., a closely watched measure of momentum have actually been trending lower the past two months. FactSet For JPMorgan, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), a momentum indicator that tracks how the magnitude of recent price gains compare with the magnitude of declines, reached an all-time high of 87.42 on Nov. 14. Many chart watchers view readings above 70 as suggesting an overbought condition. Although the stock has run up 9% since then, amid optimism over President-elect Donald Trump’s pro-business and antiregulation policy promises, the RSI has declined to 62.60 on Friday. B. of A’s RSI peaked at a 34-year high of 88.57 on Nov. 15, and has since fallen to 62.86 despite a 14% surge in the stock price. FactSet The SPDR Financial Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLF, +0.56% which houses both stocks, is also suffering from a bearish technical divergence. Don’t miss: Financial ETF nears highest level since 2008 after bullish bank results. Contrary to popular belief, overbought readings don’t mean a stock’s rally is close to over. As Constance Brown so proficiently pointed out in “Technical Analysis for the Trading Professional,” the ability to become overbought is actually a bullish sign. What can be bearish, however, is when technical oscillators such as RSI, which travel between zero and 100, fall below their overbought thresholds, and are unable to cross back above them despite continued gains in the stock price. Although JPMorgan and B. of A. shares have run up to new long-term intraday highs on Friday, JPMorgan’s RSI hasn’t peeked above 70 since Jan. 3, and B. of A.’s RSI hasn’t been above 70 since Dec. 15. Bearish divergences don’t always lead to long-term or even medium-term price tops, but they can, so they warn investors to wait until prices and technicals start telling the same story again. FactSet The sharp selloff in bank stocks in early 2014—JPMorgan’s tumbled 13% from late March to mid May that year and B. of A.’s plunged 19%—was preceded by bearish RSI divergences, as was JPMorgan’s pre-financial crisis peak in early May 2007 and B. of A.’s peak in late November 2006. For those looking to buy those stocks after a dip, don’t wait for the RSI to fall below the oversold threshold of 30, because if it does, it might suggest a longer-term downtrend may have started. For stocks in bull markets, Brown said “the 40 level is never broken.” FactSet For JPMorgan, some downside stock price levels to watch include the late December low of $85.04, previous resistance around $80.50, and the big one is the price gap between the Nov. 8 high of $70.54 and the Nov. 9 low of $71.32. Potential support levels for B. of A.’s stock include the late December low of $21.77, and the price gaps between Nov. 11 high and Nov. 12 low—$19.03 to $19.40—and between the Nov. 8 high and the Nov. 9 low—$17.10 to $17.40.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Renae Merle January 13 Follow @renaemerle Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, walks through the halls between sessions during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in 2015. (Jason Alden/Bloomberg News) NEW YORK — Profits at JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America surged last year, the banks said Friday, as the industry received a boost from a stock market rally that accelerated after the presidential election. The industry is entering what analysts say could be a period of renewed growth, with rising interest rates making it easier for banks to earn a profit and President-elect Donald Trump having said he will roll back regulations put in place after the financial crisis that have hampered industry profits. Increased trading levels across U.S. markets, which are near record levels, has also boosted the industry. JPMorgan and Bank of America, two of the largest banks in the world, both beat analysts’ profit expectations and gave positive forecasts for the future. “The optimism for positive change here at Bank of America and among our customers is palpable,” Bank of America chief executive Brian Moynihan said on a conference call with analysts. The new administration has raised the prospect of  corporate tax reform and regulatory changes, Moynihan said. “We’ll have to see how these topics play out, but we are optimistic,” he said. The North Carolina bank reported its largest yearly profit, nearly $18 billion, or $1.50 a share, since the financial crisis. During the fourth quarter, net income jumped 43 percent to $4.7 billion, or 40 cents a share, compared to the same period in 2015 as Bank of America continued to cut costs. Revenue increased about 2 percent during the quarter to $20 billion. At JPMorgan, chief executive Jamie Dimon also expressed optimism. “The U.S. economy may be building momentum,” he said in a statement. “Looking ahead there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth.” In a conference call, Dimon said he is “comforted” that Trump has picked “professionals” for his administration, including Treasury Department nominee Steven Mnuchin. “Give him some time,” said Dimon, who is serving on Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum. JPMorgan’s profits jumped 24 percent during the fourth quarter to $6.73 billion, or $1.71 a share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 a share, during the same period a year ago. For the entire year, profits were up about 1 percent to $24.7 billion ($6.18 a share) while revenue reached more than $95 billion. “Our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year,” Dimon said in a statement. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo lagged its competitors as it continues to recover from a sales scandal that put it in the crosshairs of lawmakers and sparked several federal investigations. In September, the bank admitted that thousands of low-level employees had set up sham accounts to meet sales quotas.  In some cases, the customers were charged various fees for accounts they did not know existed. The bank has apologized repeatedly and refunded more than $3 million to customers for fees they were charged on accounts they didn’t ask for. Earlier this week, the company announced a new pay plan that replaces the sales goals. But the scandal appears to be weighing on its bottom line. Wells Fargo opened 40 percent fewer checking accounts and 43 percent fewer credit cards in December compared with the same period in 2015. It reported a 4 percent dip in profits last year, $21.9 billion, or $3.99 a share, compared with $22.9 billion, or $4.12 a share, in 2015. Revenue increased about 3 percent to $88.3 billion. During the fourth quarter, net income dipped to $5.3 billion, or 96 cents a share, at the San Francisco bank compared with $5.6 billion ($1.03) during the same period in 2015. Revenue was flat during the quarter at about $21 billion. “We continued to make progress in the fourth quarter in rebuilding the trust of our customers, team members and other key stakeholders,” chief executive Tim Sloan said in a statement. “While we have more work to do, I am proud of the effort of our entire team to make things right for our customers and team members and to continue building a better Wells Fargo for the future.” business business true Please provide a valid email address.

 What you need to know on Wall Street right now Business Insider Jan. 13, 2017, 1:17 PM 858 facebook linkedin twitter email print amie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co., speaks at the Economic Club of Washington September 12, 2016 in Washington, DC. Getty/Win McNamee Welcome to Finance Insider, Business Insider's summary of the top stories of the past 24 hours. Wall Street banks kicked off fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, and the tone was pretty optimistic. Two of the largest banks in the US, JPMorgan and Bank of America, beat analyst expectations, and JPMorgan beat on revenue expectations as well. Wells Fargo meanwhile missed on earnings in its first full quarter since its accounts scandal. The brightest spot was the firms' — and their CEOs' — commentary on the outlook for 2017. Here's the memo the CEO of JPMorgan's giant investment bank just sent to staff. Morgan Stanley just named 140 new managing directors. The US bank also laid off a number of senior investment bankers last week and cut bonuses by roughly 15% because of a decline in revenue from dealmaking. And Deutsche Bank plans to put its home German market and corporate customers at the center of its plans when it spells out more of its future strategy. Elsewhere on Wall Street,  Anthony Scaramucci, the founder of SkyBridge Capital, is headed to the White House. In markets news, Trump's tweets are driving millennials to make a rookie investing mistake. And inexperienced traders and electronic trading systems helped cause the pound's "flash crash," according to a new report from the Bank of International Settlements. In the tech sector, the first big tech IPO of 2017 is already showing a worrisome sign. Bets that Fitbit is in trouble are piling up. Snapchat is making its app less confusing as it prepares to IPO. And Pandora said it is laying off 7% of its workforce. Business Insider announced Friday that Pedro da Costa is joining as senior correspondent covering markets and finance, with a particular focus on the Federal Reserve. You can follow him on Twitter here.  Lastly, this is the final word on whether you can wear a dress shirt without a tie. Here are the top Wall Street headlines from the past 24 hours Americans have never been this conflicted about the economy's direction —The partisan difference in opinion on the US economy has never been this wide in the history of at least one major survey. Retail sales jump in December on strong car and online shopping — US retail sales rose roughly in line with expectations in December, according to the Commerce Department.  BARCLAYS: "Markets may have taken the wrong lessons from Donald Trump and Brexit" —Barclays believes traders and finance firms have "thrown the baby out with the bathwater" in the wake of Trump and Brexit, and are now overestimating the populist risk in the French election. There was a "moment of drama" at the first major gathering of OPEC ministers since the agreement to cut production —Gulf Cooperation Council oil ministers expressed confidence that sovereign producers would live up to their commitments to cut output at theGlobal Energy Forum in Abu Dhabi on Thursday — the first major gathering of key OPEC oil ministers since the November agreement to cut production. Asset manager BlackRock's quarterly profit falls 1.2% — BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, reported a 1.2%fall in quarterly profit on Friday as investors rushed into low-cost funds. It's time to start positioning your portfolio for rising interest rates —As Trumponomics get closer in the side mirror for the United States, fixed income investors would be wise to focus on allocations.  Goldman Sachs says millennials didn't inherit a spending habit companies have capitalized on for years — Millennials tend to do a lot of things differently than their parents. They'd rather pay for an Uber than a new outfit. They're cutting cable. And, apparently, they hate napkins. Lexus just unveiled a gorgeous yacht concept that's perfect for tech tycoons— Lexus is trying its hand at designing more than just cars.  Here's a first look at Mercedes' new 1,000 horsepower hybrid supercar —Mercedes-Benz and its AMG performance division announced on January 12 that it is set to introduce a new 1,000 horsepower hybrid hypercar. The 10 best islands for honeymooning —A honeymoon should be a trip to remember, but choosing a destination can be tough.

JPMorgan Chase led the pack with a 24 percent increase in profit, to $6.73 billion from $5.43 billion during the same period a year ago. Net income totaled $1.71 a share, beating analysts’ estimates of $1.43. JPMorgan shares were recently up 1.2 percent at $87.29. The Dow Jones industrial average — which has retreated this week after peaking last Friday at 19,999.63, just shy of the 20,000-point milestone — was little changed following the banks’ results, recently up 12.85 at 19,903.85. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon made a pitch during a Friday conference call for the deregulation of Wall Street, arguing that the Obama-era rules had held back economic growth. “No rational person that I know could possible say that all the things done were accurate, coordinated, consistent, proper and made it a safer system,” he said during a call with journalists. “It’s time to take a look at that. I hope the new administration does.” JPMorgan’s bond trading revenue rose 31 percent, to $3.37 billion, boosting the bank’s bottom line. The final three months of the year were rollercoaster of major financial events, with the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, Trump’s election sparking a trading frenzy, and the fallout from Wells Fargo’s fake-accounts scandal taking hold. The year had begun with one of the sector’s worst quarters ever as stocks cratered on plummeting oil prices and weakness in the Chinese economy. Brian Moynihan, Bank of America’s CEO, pushed a narrative of “responsible growth” during a conference call as the bank reported an uneven quarter. Profit was up 43 percent on a nearly $1 billion cut in non-interest expenses, as $19.9 billion in revenue missed analysts’ expectations. The bank also projected it would buy back about $1.8 billion in stock during the first half of the year. “The optimism for positive change here at BofA and among our customers is palpable and has driven prices higher,” Moynihan said during a conference call. Friday was the first earnings announcement for Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan, who stepped into the role in October after John Stumpf buckled under intense pressure to resign in the wake of the bank’s fake-accounts scandal. It wasn’t good. The bank’s profits slipped 5.4 percent to $5.27 billion, or 96 cents a share. Analysts expected a buck a share. Mortgage revenue fell by 15 percent to $1.42 billion, missing some analyts’ forecasts. Overall revenue was flat at $21.6 billion. Legal costs rose by 19 percent to $984 million amid the fake-accounts fracas. “We continued to make progress in the fourth quarter in rebuilding the trust of our customers, team members and other key stakeholders,” Sloan said in a statement.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    U.S. stocks were higher in morning trading on Friday, boosted by bank stocks after better-then-expected quarterly profits from Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, which bode well for the rest of the earnings season. Bank of America jumped 2.1 percent to $23.41, their highest since the financial crisis. JPMorgan surged 2.2 percent at a record high of $88.17 and Wells Fargo gained 3.1 percent to $56.20. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the financial index's 1.04 percent rise leading the advancers. The KBW Bank index was up 2 percent, set for their best day since Dec. 1. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is estimated to have risen 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter, largely helped by financial companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "There is a lot of optimism regarding the financial sector but any kind of cautious statement from them might cause a bit of a pullback," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. "All the changes that are being proposed for the sector is going to take some time, it's not going to happen right away." U.S. stocks overall have been on the rise since the election on optimism that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's policies to boost infrastructure spending and reform corporate taxes will benefit the economy. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500's 6.1 percent rise, boosted by hopes of deregulation and increased interest rates. But, analysts fear the market has run too far too soon, with Trump's policies expected to hit legislature hurdles, and with stock valuations stretched. Blackrock Chief Executive Larry Fink told CNBC that if the roll out of growth initiatives by Trump are slower, then the markets are ahead of themselves. Shares of the world's largest asset manager were up 1.7 percent at $384.56 after the company reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit. Highlighting bank earnings: - Wells Fargo & Co., the third-largest U.S. bank by assets, said it believes it has reimbursed the customers it needs to in order to comply with at least one of three settlements over a bogus-accounts scandal. The San Francisco-based bank has been dealing with multiple lawsuits and a sharp drop in account openings after it settled with the Los Angeles City Attorney, the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in September over charges that its employees created 2 million accounts without customers' consent. Chief Executive Timothy Sloan - who took over after John Stumpf resigned in the wake of the scandal - said he was pleased with the progress the bank has made in customer remediation, as well as its ongoing review of sales practices across the company. The bank disclosed the new details as it posted its fifth straight decline in quarterly earnings on Friday, results that diverged from rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N). Both posted significantly higher earnings on Friday on the back of higher interest rates and market gains since the U.S. election in November. Net income applicable to shareholders fell 6.4 percent to $4.87 billion, or 96 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $5.20 billion, or $1.00 per share, a year earlier. It said it has made $3.2 million of refunds for potentially unauthorized accounts that incurred fees and charges, which it believes fulfills its repayment requirements under the settlement to the L.A. City Attorney. It could not be determined whether the bank has reimbursement requirements under the other two settlements. A spokesman for Wells Fargo had no immediate response and a call to the Los Angeles City Attorney was not immediately returned. - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) reported a 24 percent rise in fourth-quarter profits on Friday, beating analyst expectations, as its Wall Street business benefited from a surge in trading activity following the U.S. election. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender, said earnings rose to $6.7 billion, or $1.71 per share, from $5.4 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding an atypical tax benefit, the bank earned $1.58 per share, well above the average analyst estimate of $1.44 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. JPMorgan has one of the largest global investment banks, which affects its earnings significantly when market activity picks up or declines. Along with other big banks, it was widely expected to benefit from a wave of trading in stocks and bonds following Donald Trump's stunning victory in the presidential election on Nov. 8. Revenue from fixed-income trading – JPMorgan's most volatile business – rose 31 percent to $3.4 billion, while stock trading revenue increased 8 percent to $1.2 billion. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), which reported results earlier on Friday, also said trading revenue surged last quarter. In a statement discussing results, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon cited those market trends, as well as growth in deposits and loans, higher credit card sales and competitive gains in "virtually all" of JPMorgan's businesses. The bank also kept a tight lid on expenses, he said. - BlackRock Inc, the world's biggest asset manager, reported better-than-expected quarterly profits on Friday as it clamped down on expenses and investors stormed into lower-cost funds to take advantage of a year-end rally. Investors poured $88 billion into the company's market-tracking index investments and its iShares exchange-traded funds during the quarter, while pulling $546 million from funds managed actively by portfolio managers, underscoring a stark dichotomy of investors favoring lower-cost, passive investments. "We're the big beneficiary of that change, but we'll be a beneficiary if there's a rebound into active," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told Reuters. - Bank of America Corp reported a 46.8 percent rise in quarterly profit on Friday, kicking off what is expected to be a strong period for U.S. banks following an upswing in market activity in the wake of the U.S. presidential election. Also helped by a sharp fall in expenses, net income attributable to shareholders of the No. 2 U.S. bank by assets rose to $4.34 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31 from $2.95 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share jumped to 40 cents from 27 cents. Analysts on an average had expected earnings of 38 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, although it was not immediately clear if the reported figures were comparable. Excluding a debt valuation adjustment, total sales and trading revenue rose 11 percent in the quarter, spurred by a surge in activity in stock and bond markets following Donald Trump's surprise victory on Nov. 8.   © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: An increase in Facebook pushed the Nasdaq to a record high on Friday and the S&P 500 also rose after major U.S. banks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season with strong results. Wall Street has surged since President-elect Donald Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at price-to-earnings valuations well above historical averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America , JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo ended 1.36 percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.53 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, far outpacing the S&P 500's 6-percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow dipped marginally, with Wal-Mart Stores and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light, with financial markets closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. For the week, the Dow fell 0.4 percent, the S&P 500 shed 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1 percent. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Friday was provided by Facebook , which jumped 1.36 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P 500 is trading at 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Bank stocks will stay in favor with investors as long as earnings reports in the coming week keep show an improving profit outlook while investors wait to see if Trump lives up to his campaign promises. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.34-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 14 new lows. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, lower than the 6.4 billion average in the last 20 sessions.

NEW YORK: US stocks were higher in morning trading on Friday, boosted by bank stocks after better-then-expected quarterly profits from Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, which bode well for the rest of the earnings season.

US retail sales rose solidly in December amid strong demand for automobiles, with data showing retail sales increased 0.6% last month, slightly below the 0.7% increase expected by economists. A separate report at 10am ET is expected to show US consumer sentiment improved to 98.5 in January from 98.2. Pandora Media was up 8.2% at US$12.98 after the online radio service said it would reduce its US workforce and that it expects to surpass its fourth-quarter revenue forecast. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,769 to 810. On the Nasdaq, 1,722 issues rose and 544 fell.

The bank reported fourth-quarter results that topped Wall Street's estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Trading revenue rose 24%, while fixed income revenue surged 31%, thanks to market volatility following Donald Trump's election victory in November.

 Wall Street is back Portia Crowe Jan. 13, 2017, 10:08 AM 10,769 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.Getty/Mark Wilson Wall Street banks kicked off fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, and the tone was pretty optimistic. Two of the largest banks in the US, JPMorgan and Bank of America, beat analyst expectations, and JPMorgan beat on revenue expectations as well. But the brightest spot was the firms' — and their CEOs' — commentary on the outlook for 2017. "With strong leadership positions in our businesses against a backdrop of rising interest rates, we are well-positioned to continue to grow and deliver for our shareholders in 2017," Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said in a statement. His CFO, Paul Donofrio, referred to the December 2016 rise in interest rates and said, "We expect to see a significant increase in net interest income in the first quarter of 2017." The bank said it is expecting its net interest income to increase by about $600 million in the first quarter of 2017, "assuming rates remain at current levels and modest growth in loans and deposits." Bank of America is also increasing its buyback program for the first half of the year to $4.3 billion from $2.5 billion. Over at JPMorgan, CEO Jamie Dimon was candidly bullish on the US economy. "The US economy may be building momentum," he said in a statement. "Looking ahead, there is opportunity for good, rational, and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth, create jobs for Americans across the income spectrum, and help communities, and we are well-positioned to play our part." In a presentation, his firm also said it expects net interest income to be up modestly in the first quarter because of interest rate increases. JPMorgan's share price hit an all-time high shortly after the bank published results. Meanwhile, the business that had for years been killing Wall Street banks continued to bounce back. Both firms saw continued pickups in fixed income, currencies, and commodities trading revenues. At JPMorgan, FICC revenues were up 12% from the year-ago quarter, helping the bank post record fourth-quarter markets revenues. BAML's FICC revenues increased 31%. Bank stocks have also seen a massive postelection rally. The SPDR S&P Bank ETF is up 24% since Donald Trump's election win largely because of expectations that his administration will reduce financial regulations and boost dealmaking and economic activity.

"The issue that I have is that the bank stocks, if you give them price-to-earnings multiple, they're the cheapest of any group in the stock market. I would sell Procter & Gamble and buy JPMorgan right now, " Cramer said on "Squawk on the Street." Cramer said, "JPMorgan is a totally defensible buy because it doesn't sell at a high multiple to earnings." Bank stocks have rallied in recent months on expectations that President-elect Donald Trump will eliminate regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. On Friday, JPMorgan's quarterly earnings pushed well past analysts' expectations, helped by double-digit growth in deposits and record credit card sales. Its stock price was up 1.4 percent in early trading Friday. Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said in a earnings release there is an opportunity this year for "good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented."

Bank of America jumped 2.1 percent to $23.41, their highest since the financial crisis. JPMorgan surged 2.2 percent at a record high of $88.17 and Wells Fargo gained 3.1 percent to $56.20. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the financial index's 1.04 percent rise leading the advancers. The KBW Bank index was up 2 percent, set for their best day since Dec. 1. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is estimated to have risen 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter, largely helped by financial companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "There is a lot of optimism regarding the financial sector but any kind of cautious statement from them might cause a bit of a pullback," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. "All the changes that are being proposed for the sector is going to take some time, it's not going to happen right away." At 9:37 a.m. ET (1437 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 52.59 points, or 0.26 percent, at 19,943.59. The S&P 500 was up 5.77 points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,276.21 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 22.46 points, or 0.4 percent, at 5,569.95. U.S. stocks overall have been on the rise since the election on optimism that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's policies to boost infrastructure spending and reform corporate taxes will benefit the economy. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500's 6.1 percent rise, boosted by hopes of deregulation and increased interest rates. But, analysts fear the market has run too far too soon, with Trump's policies expected to hit legislature hurdles, and with stock valuations stretched. Blackrock Chief Executive Larry Fink told CNBC that if the roll out of growth initiatives by Trump are slower, then the markets are ahead of themselves. Shares of the world's largest asset manager were up 1.7 percent at $384.56 after the company reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit. U.S. retail sales rose solidly in December amid strong demand for automobiles, with data showing retail sales increased 0.6 percent last month, slightly below the 0.7 percent increase expected by economists. A separate report at 10 a.m. ET is expected to show U.S. consumer sentiment improved to 98.5 in January from 98.2. Pandora Media was up 8.2 percent at $12.98 after the online radio service said it would reduce its U.S. workforce and that it expects to surpass its fourth-quarter revenue forecast. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,769 to 810. On the Nasdaq, 1,722 issues rose and 544 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 15 new 52-week highs and no new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 46 new highs and four new lows.

And with expected economic stimulus and tax cuts likely to bring interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve, banks are expected to see continued profitability this year. JPMorgan Chase announced record profits for 2016, boosted by a “dynamic” US economy and a surge in brokerage activities.  Annual net profit rose 1.2 per cent to US$27.7 billion (RM123.6 billion), including US$6.73 billion in the fourth quarter alone. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share of US$6.19 for the year which was above analysts’ expectations. Bank of America said higher interest rates and an increase in consumer loans boosted earnings, but its business grew less than expected.  Net profit in 2016 jumped 13 per cent year-on-year to US$16.2 billion, marked by a 46.8 jump in the fourth quarter. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share of US$1.50 for the year.  Bank of America, which had gained 35 per cent on Wall Street since the November 8 election, fell 0.17 per cent at 1225 GMT in pre-opening trading — reflecting the disappointment of investors who expected the post-election euphoria to boost earnings further.  While revenues from consumer loans increased as expected following the interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve in December, revenues from market activities were not as strong as hoped. “If the recent rate hike occurred too late to boost fourth quarter results, we anticipate a higher profit growth in the first quarter of 2017,” chief financial officer Paul Donofrio said in a press release.  The Fed has suggested it could raise rates three times this year, given that the Trump administration promises deregulation of the financial sector, massive tax cuts and large investments in infrastructure.  Meanwhile, troubled Wells Fargo reported lower-than-expected 2016 results, hit by the scandal over thousands of fictitious accounts created without the knowledge of its clients. In the fallout the bank paid a fine of US$185 million and the CEO resigned under pressure. Net profit fell 4.2 per cent to US$21.94 billion last year, including a drop of 5.4 per cent in the fourth quarter alone due to a series of costly measures the bank implemented to regain consumer confidence. Earnings per share was US$3.99 compared to the analysts’ expectation of US$4.03. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week World’s eight richest as wealthy as half of humanity, Oxfam tells Davos Trump threatens BMW with border tax on cars built in Mexico Job cuts, fewer flights?

Finance Search Major US banks post strong 2016 earningsAFP – Fri, Jan 13, 2017 8:51 PM AEDT Related Content View Photo JPMorgan Chase announced record profits for 2016, boosted by a "dynamic" US economy and a surge in brokerage activities Wells Fargo reported lower fourth-quarter earnings Friday, underperforming two large rivals, following its bogus accounts scandal, but the firms were upbeat about the outlook. The banks said they were hopeful higher interest rates and a potentially more favorable regulatory climate under President-elect Donald Trump could boost the industry. Wells Fargo, which has been under pressure following revelations last fall that it opened some two million accounts without their customers' knowledge, said it refunded $3.2 million in fees resulting from the fake accounts, up from the prior $2.6 million. Research also showed more than 175,000 customers who had unauthorized credit cards opened received a lower credit rating from a credit bureau, the bank said. However, some of the data released by the bank suggested clients are beginning to move past the debacle. Total branch interactions in December rose 11 percent from November, although they were still down six percent from the year-ago period. Wells chief executive Tim Sloan said on an analyst conference call the bank welcomed signs of a possible ?inflection point,? although it was too soon to know. Net profit fell 4.2 percent to $21.94 billion last year, including a drop of 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter alone due to a series of costly measures the bank implemented to regain consumer confidence. Despite the woes over Wells Fargo accounts, the banking sector is viewed as having strong prospects, boosted by the recovering economy and booming financial market that followed the Trump's election. And with expected economic stimulus and tax cuts likely to bring interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve, banks are likely to see continued profitability this year. The Dow Jones US Banks Index has risen about 25 percent since November 8. Investors cheered the earnings reports, lifting shares of Wells Fargo 2.4 percent to $55.80, Bank of America 1.0 percent to $23.17 and JPMorgan Chase 1.2 percent to $87.28 in midday trading. - Dimon hopeful on Trump - JPMorgan Chase, the biggest US bank by assets, announced record profits for 2016, boosted by a "dynamic" US economy and a surge in brokerage activities. Annual net profit rose 1.2 percent to $27.7 billion, including $6.73 billion in the fourth quarter alone. Executives with JPMorgan described US consumer activity as resilient and the US economy as generally solid. Total loans were $894.8 billion, up seven percent from the year-ago period. Chief executive Jamie Dimon said he was encouraged by Trump's selection of Rex Tillerson as secretary of state and Steven Mnuchin as secretary of treasury. He also said he was hopeful the president-elect's broadsides against free trade were political rhetoric and would be followed up with more reasonable policies. ?I have some confidence he'll do the right thing for America,? Dimon said on a conference call with reporters. ?Give him some time.? Bank of America said higher interest rates and an increase in consumer loans boosted earnings, but its business grew less than expected. Net profit in 2016 jumped 13 percent year-on-year to $16.2 billion, marked by a 46.8 jump in the fourth quarter. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $1.50 for the year. While revenues from consumer loans increased as expected following the Federal Reserve interest rate hike in December, revenues from market activities were not as strong as hoped. "If the recent rate hike occurred too late to boost fourth quarter results, we anticipate a higher profit growth in the first quarter of 2017," chief financial officer Paul Donofrio said in a press release. The Fed has suggested it could raise rates three times this year, given the Trump administration promises of massive tax cuts and large investments in infrastructure, which could fuel inflation.

While Dimon wouldn't defend the trades, he repeatedly called the $2 billion loss "purely management's mistakes," refusing to yield any... By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon seems hopeful that better times for the economy lie ahead under President-elect Donald Trump. The bank reported better than expected profit for the fourth quarter Friday. And in its earnings release, Dimon suggested more good news could be coming for banks -- and for Americans -- in the months ahead. "The U.S. economy may be building momentum," Dimon said. "Looking ahead there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth, create jobs for Americans across the income spectrum and help communities." Dimon didn't mention Trump by name or cite specifics about the possibility of Trump and the Republican-led Congress unwinding some of President Obama's financial reforms. During a conference call with reporters, Dimon tempered his enthusiasm. "I'm usually an optimist. But I'm neither euphoric nor depressed," he said, adding that he is hopeful there will be more regulatory and tax reform. He added that it's too soon to tell what, if anything, will change in Washington. Dimon will clearly have a key role in helping the new president's economic policy though. Dimon is one of 16 CEOs on Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, a group that also includes IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, Disney CEO Bob Iger, GM CEO Mary Barra and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon. Asked during the media call what advice he would whisper in Trump's ear, Dimon quipped, "I don't whisper." He declined to give specifics about what specifically he would suggest, saying there is no one big thing that must be addressed first. Answering a question from CNNMoney, Dimon said he was not overly worried about Trump's attacks against companies for doing business in Mexico or about his protectionist rhetoric -- even though JPMorgan Chase does business around the globe. Dimon said he's putting aside the Trump one-liners and is "comforted" that Trump has put "professionals" in the administration such as treasury nominee Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs exec, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary and former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. "Give him some time," Dimon said of Trump. Even though Dimon said there are still questions about what's next for banks, Wall Street seemed pleased with the results. JPMorgan Chase's stock was up nearly 2% in early trading Friday following its earnings. The stock, along with that of other banks, has been on a tear since the election -- largely because of hopes for fewer regulations and rising interest rates, which would boost profits. Shares of JPMorgan Chase are up 23% since the election. Bank of America has also risen sharply, and it, too, reported solid earnings Friday morning. BofA CEO Brian Moynihan didn't mention Trump either in his bank's earnings release. But he pointed out that the Fed, which raised interest rates last month and is expected to do so several more times this year, will help BofA. JPMorgan Chase CFO Marianne Lake echoed that during her bank's earnings call with reporters. She said the company was excited about more rate hikes but that it will take time for them to improve profits. "We are still at absolutely very low levels of rates," she noted. Scandal-ridden Wells Fargo also reported its latest results on Friday morning. The bank, which was forced to admit last year that it opened up millions of fake accounts, disappointed Wall Street with earnings and sales that missed forecasts. But shares of both BofA and Wells Fargo rallied Friday along with JPMorgan Chase. Several other big banks, including Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, will report their latest results next week. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

News Week In Review: Trump Murders Drug Stocks; Apple Breaks Out; GM Bullish President-elect Donald Trump accused drugmakers of "getting away with murder" and took aim at the costly F-35 fighter jet again at this week's press conference. (AP) IBD STAFF 1/13/2017 Reprints President-elect Donald Trump slammed the high cost of drugs and the F-35 once again, pressuring related stocks. But General Motors (GM), Amazon (AMZN), consumers and small businesses are bullish. Apple (AAPL) hit a buy point, while JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other bank stocks reported earnings. Nasdaq Hits High As Apple Trumps Drugs Donald Trump continued to go after companies and industries and he didn't talk much about tax cuts or other stimulus, but the major averages held up well. The Nasdaq rose 1% to all-time highs. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.4% and the S&P 500 0.1%. Drug and biotech stocks tumbled on Trump's pledge to go after high prices. But Apple broke out of a base, joining Alphabet (GOOGL) and Netflix (NFLX). Bank stocks rose modestly Friday after JPMorgan, BofA and Wells Fargo reported earnings and Treasury yields rebounded. Trump: Drugmakers 'Getting Away With Murder' President-elect Trump doubled-down on his criticism of high drug prices, saying Wednesday that the industry is "getting away with murder." He said that "new bidding procedures" are needed, suggesting support for legislation traditionally favored by Democrats, not Republicans. Drug and biotech stocks sold off hard on the comments. Trump also returned to attacking the costly Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter jet, saying he'll save billions of dollars as he pushes more competition. Lockheed, which has said that it is reducing per-jet costs after years of overruns and delays, said that it's promised to "aggressively" reduce F-35 expenses. Lockheed's CEO met with Trump on Friday, their second such meeting since the election. Lockheed rose modestly Friday, but fell 1.3% for the week.

JPMorgan Chase beat on earnings and revenue while Bank of America (BAC) topped on earnings but fell short on revenue. Wells Fargo (WFC), still dealing with the fallout from its false accounts scandal, missed on the top and bottom line. All three rose modestly on Friday. RELATED: JPMorgan Beats, Bank Of America Q4 Results Mixed; Wells Fargo Misses Consumers, Business Optimism Soaring The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index rose 0.8 point in January to 55.6, a fresh 10-year high after soaring 3.4 points in December. Americans have become much more upbeat since the presidential election, as stock markets have soared on hopes that Donald Trump will cut taxes and regulation and ramp up infrastructure spending to boost economic growth. Meanwhile, the NFIB's small business optimism index spiked in December to a 12-year best. A net 50% of small firms see business conditions improving vs. -7% in October. RELATED: Economic Optimism Hits New 10-Year High As Trump Rally Continues Trump Bump: Small Business Optimism Soars To 12-Year High General Motors, Ford Bullish On Future General Motors sees 2017 EPS of $6-$6.50 up from its 2016 target of $5.50-$6.00. Analysts have expected $6.01 for 2016, but then a decline to $5.71 this year. GM, which recently reported a surprisingly strong 10% gain in U.S. sales for December, also added $5 billion to its stock buyback program. Ford, meanwhile, added $200 million — or 5 cents a share — to its regular quarterly dividend. Ford sees earnings falling this year amid heavy investments, but "improved profitability" in 2018. GM shares rose 3.75% for the week, hitting their best levels in nearly two years. Ford fell 1%. Fiat Chrysler Slammed On Diesel Emissions The EPA accused Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) of cheating diesel emissions standards in some 104,000 recent trucks and SUVs. Fiat Chrysler denied any wrongdoing, but shares fell 10% Thursday after hitting a record high earlier that day. Earlier in the week, Volkswagen (VLKAY) pleaded guilty in relation to its diesel emissions testing, agreeing to pay a $4.3 billion fine. Prosecutors charged 5 VW officials living in Germany. Tesla Motors (TSLA) hired two Apple execs, one of whom will head up the automaker's Autopilot software efforts. CEO Elon Musk once mocked Apple, which has its own unconfirmed "Project Titan" electric car initiative, as a "Tesla graveyard." Tesla also sketched out how it will charge fees for using its Supercharger fees, but only for drivers who order after Jan. 15. Tesla shares rose 3.8% to seven-month highs. RELATED: General Motors Soars On Bullish Earnings Forecast; Ford Looks To 2018 Walgreens-Rite Aid Approval Soon The Federal Trade Commission is expected to approve the drugstore merger between Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Rite Aid (RAD) before the Obama administration ends on Jan. 20, the New York Post reported, citing sources. Walgreens announced the $9-a-share deal back in October 2015. Shares of Walgreens rose 0.9% while Rite Aid climbed 3.1% to 8.66. Smaller rival Fred's (FRED), which is buying 865 Rite Aid stores as part of the effort to ease antitrust concerns, fell 8.6%. RELATED: Walgreens-Rite Aid Merger OK Seen Before Trump Takes Office Amazon Will Add 100,000 U.S. Jobs Fresh off another strong holiday season for the e-commerce giant, Amazon said it would expand its "full-time, full-benefit" U.S.-based workforce to 280,000 by mid-2018, from 180,000 last year. Amazon's workforce was 30,000 in 2011. Amazon is adding positions "from engineers and software developers to those seeking entry-level positions and on-the-job training." Amazon's gain is likely to come at the expense of traditional brick-and-mortar retailers and other rivals. Amazon rose 2.7% for the week, closing in on all-time highs. RELATED: Amazon Plants A 'We're Hiring' Sign To Reach 100,000 New Jobs Holidays Weren't Just For Amazon The holidays were rough on retailers not named Amazon.com (AMZN), as online shopping and subdued store traffic hung heavy. But it wasn't all bad: Morgan Stanley analysts called Lululemon (LULU), which lifted the low end of guidance, a holiday "standout" following its appearance of the annual ICR conference. Francesca's (FRAN) and Genesco (GCO) now expect results toward the upper end of previously announced guidance, and Ollie's Bargain Outlets (OLLI) raised its outlook. Wells Fargo analysts like Lululemon and off-price retailers such as TJX Cos. (TJX), but said the said the retail sector is generally almost "uninvestable." Retail sales rose 0.6% in December, slightly below views, and just 0.2% excluding autos. Nonstore sales, including Amazon, led the way while department stores struggled. Oil Prices Swing On U.S. Gains, OPEC Cuts Oil prices fell hard early in the week, then bounced back somewhat as traders try to balance current and future U.S. production gains against OPEC output curbs. But crude futures closed down 3% to $52.37 a barrel, their biggest drop since early November. North American oil companies' spending on exploration and production will rise 27% this year after falling the prior two years, but higher oilfield service costs will account for some of the increase, according to Barclays analysts. Hess Corp. (HES) and Parsley Energy (PE) said they would boost spending this year. The EIA said U.S. crude stockpiles increased by 4.1 million barrels, well above the 1.2 million-barrel increase analysts expected. U.S. production rose 1.9% to 8.95 million barrels per day, the biggest increase in 20 months, with total production level hitting an eight-month high. Russia and Kazakhstan are cutting back output and Saudi Arabia has reduced deliveries to Asia as part of the OPEC deal, but Iraq is reportedly trying to boost exports even further.

The company said margin pressure from higher fuel and labor costs "is likely to peak" in Q1, but that margins should begin expanding by the second half of the year. Delta also said that Donald Trump's victory has already boosted demand and hopes a Trump administration will bring opportunities for tax and regulatory reform, infrastructure improvement, and greater consideration of its case against Middle East rivals. The big U.S. airlines say those carriers have expanded in the U.S. on their governments' dime, an accusation those carriers have denied. Meanwhile, American Airlines (AAL), United Airlines (UAL) and Southwest (LUV) also lifted their Q1 unit-revenue forecasts.

Analysts said Applied Optoelectronics has been boosted by demand from Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB). Demand from China has also been driving revenue growth for fiber-optic component makers, but there's been speculation demand has softened. Oclaro stock rose after it said business in China has been strong as normal at a Needham & Co. conference while shares in Acacia Communications (ACIA) fell on more cautious comments.

But Trump's harsh rhetoric vs. the drug industry and prices chilled optimism. Chipotle Trending, Jack In The Box Customers 'Forgiving' Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) forecast fourth-quarter EPS and revenue below Wall Street expectations. However, improvements in same-store sales trends helped lift shares during the week. Jack in the Box (JACK) said at the 2017 ICR Conference that its late-night delivery customers, which in San Francisco can have the burger chain's food delivered through a partnership with DoorDash, were more "forgiving" on food quality. Burgers and fries tend not to hold up as well in takeout containers as tacos — Jack's best-selling item — and pizza. Other restaurants are assessing how takeout services from GrubHub (GRUB), DoorDash, Uber Eats and others fit into their business. Gaming-and-sports bar chain Dave & Buster's (PLAY) said it provided an experience that "can't be duplicated at home," while Domino's Pizza (DPZ) touted its digital ordering platform and international growth potential.

(TSM) earned 61 cents per American depositary receipt, up 42% year over year, on sales of nearly $8.25 billion, up 32%. Analysts expected 59 cents and $8.16 billion for TSMC's Q4. But for the current Q1, TSMC sees revenue of $7.44 billion at the midpoint of its guidance. It did not give an earnings target. Wall Street has been modeling TSMC to earn 51 cents per ADR, up 34% year over year, on sales of $7.67 billion, up 25%, in the March quarter. CFO Lora Ho sees weaker demand in Q1 in part due to "above seasonal supply chain inventory at the end of 2016."

The company on Friday reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.71 per share on revenue of $24.333 billion. Its stock price edged higher in premarket trading. Analysts expected JPMorgan Chase to report a profit of $1.44 per share on revenue of $23.949 billion, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. The stock has been near 52-week highs since mid-December. Fridays' report marks the bank's first results since the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate target in a year. The Fed is expected to raise them again three times this year. JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said as the U.S. economy builds momentum, there is opportunity for "good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented." David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Jamie Dimon "Our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year, reflecting our intense client focus and solid performance across our businesses," Dimon said in a release. "In the Consumer business, we had double digit growth in deposits and core loan balances, our credit card sales volume was a record, and for the year we had over $1 trillion of merchant processing volume," he said. Bank stocks have rallied in recent months on expectations that President-elect Donald Trump will eliminate regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. JPMorgan's return on tangible common equity, a key performance measure, was 12.2 percent in the latest quarter. The bank's full year net income came in at $24.7 billion, or $6.19 per share. The bank also said it returned $3.8 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter. Total noninterest expenses fell 3 percent to $13.83 billion, primarily driven by lower legal expenses. Last year, JPMorgan surpassed Wells Fargo to become the world's most valuable bank by market capitalization. That change came as JPMorgan rose slightly and Wells suffered the fallout of a phony customer account scandal. On Friday, Wells Fargo posted fourth-quarter earnings that missed on the top and bottom lines, sending shares lower nearly 1 percent in premarket trading. —Reuters contributed to this report.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad JPMorgan profit climbs 24 percent, beating forecasts, on trading surge By Reuters Published: 09:34 EST, 13 January 2017 | Updated: 09:34 EST, 13 January 2017 e-mail By David Henry and Sweta Singh Jan 13 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co reported a 24 percent rise in fourth-quarter profits on Friday, beating analyst expectations, as its Wall Street business benefited from a surge in trading activity following the U.S. election. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender, said earnings rose to $6.7 billion, or $1.71 per share, from $5.4 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding an atypical tax benefit, the bank earned $1.58 per share, well above the average analyst estimate of $1.44 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. JPMorgan has one of the largest global investment banks, which affects its earnings significantly when market activity picks up or declines. Along with other big banks, it was widely expected to benefit from a wave of trading in stocks and bonds following Donald Trump's stunning victory in the presidential election on Nov. 8. Revenue from fixed-income trading - JPMorgan's most volatile business - rose 31 percent to $3.4 billion, while stock trading revenue increased 8 percent to $1.2 billion. Bank of America Corp, which reported results earlier on Friday, also said trading revenue surged last quarter. In a statement discussing results, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon cited those market trends, as well as growth in deposits and loans, higher credit card sales and competitive gains in "virtually all" of JPMorgan's businesses. The bank also kept a tight lid on expenses, he said. JPMorgan's shares were little changed in premarket trading. Like other banks, its stock has seen big gains since the election on expectations that Trump's plans to cut taxes, ease regulations and boost infrastructure spending will help profits. JPMorgan's stock had risen 23 percent from the election through Thursday's close. Wells Fargo & Co also reported earnings on Friday, but its much smaller trading business did not benefit from post-election market enthusiasm. Its results were also hurt by the fallout from a sales scandal. Looking ahead, big banks are expected to benefit this year from rising interest rates, which allow them to charge more money for loans. The Federal Reserve, which raised a key rate target by a quarter of a percentage point in December, is expected to raise them again three times in 2017. JPMorgan said its net interest income rose 5 percent during the fourth quarter to $12.1 billion, thanks to an uptick in rates, as well as more lending. The bank's total net revenue rose 2.5 percent to $24.33 billion, beating analysts' average estimate of $23.95 billion.

The bank's net income rose to $6.73 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31 from $5.43 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to $1.71 from $1.32. (http://bit.ly/2jeHFAY) Analysts had expected earnings of $1.44 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was not immediately clear if the reported results were comparable. The earnings for both the latest and year-earlier periods included special items. Bank of America Corp, the second-largest U.S. bank, kicked off the quarterly earnings period for big U.S. lenders earlier on Friday, announcing a 46.8 percent rise in profit. The stunning election of Donald Trump on Nov. 8 set off a wave of trading in stocks and bonds during what is normally a slow period for trading desks at big banks. JPMorgan and BofA were also reporting their first results since the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate target for the second time since 2006 on Dec. 14. Higher interest rates are usually good for banks, allowing them to charge higher rates on loans.

 JPMorgan beats, has a record-breaking quarter Portia Crowe Jan. 13, 2017, 7:30 AM 4,135 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.Getty/Win McNamee JPMorgan just reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations. The firm on Friday reported earnings per share of $1.71 on revenue of $24.33 billion. Analysts were expecting adjusted earnings per share of $1.43 on revenue of $24.17 billion, according to Bloomberg. "2016 demonstrated the strength and depth of our platform with record net income and EPS in an increasingly complex global environment," CEO Jamie Dimon said in a statement. The corporate and investment bank had its best revenue on record for a fourth quarter, according to chief financial officer Marianne Lake. The markets business — including both fixed income and equities trading — also had its highest revenues on record for the fourth quarter. Here's the breakdown: Total trading revenue for the quarter came in at $4.52 billion ($4.34 billion expected), up 24% from the year-ago quarter. Within trading, fixed-income revenue was $3.37 billion ($3.09 billion expected), up 31% year-over-year. That was driven by stronger performance across products, according to the firm. Equities were $1.15 billion ($1.29 billion expected), up 8% from the year-ago quarter thanks to stronger performance in derivatives. Investment-banking revenue came in at $1.49 billion ($1.59 billion expected), up 1% from the prior-year quarter thanks to higher debt-underwriting fees, the firm said. That was offset by lower advisory and equity-underwriting fees. Dimon also commented on the US political and economic environment: "The U.S. economy may be building momentum. Looking ahead there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth, create jobs for Americans across the income spectrum and help communities, and we are wellpositioned to play our part. Business plays a critical positive role in society, and in collaboration with nonprofits, governments and educational institutions, it can help strengthen our economy and our country." In the same quarter last year, JPMorgan beat expectations, reporting earnings per share of $1.32 on revenue of $23.74 billion. In the third quarter, the firm had a record-breaking quarter, reporting earnings per share of $1.58 on adjusted revenue of $24.67 billion. The corporate and investment bank had its best reported performance for a third quarter on record, as well as the highest fees on record for a third quarter, according to CFO Marianne Lake. Bank of America reported Q4 earnings earlier Friday. Wells Fargo also reports at about 8 a.m. ET on Friday, followed by Morgan Stanley on Tuesday.

Investors largely shrugged off figures that showed Chinese exports fell the most last year since 2009, and will look to earnings reports from U.S. banks JP Morgan Chase (>> JPMorgan Chase & Co.), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (>> Bank of America Corp) and Wells Fargo (>> Wells Fargo & Co) later in the day for direction. “The banking sector will be the major focus,” said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK. “With rising interest rates and hopes of more friendly regulation, the shares of these banks have a lot of upside in the coming days.” Bank stocks led the charge in European trading, rising 1 percent <.SX7P> to lift the FTSEuroFirst 300 <.FTEU3> 0.5 percent. The broader index was still down slightly on the week though, its first weekly fall in six. Shares in Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (>> Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV) rose 6 percent, recouping some of the previous session’s 16 percent slump triggered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) accusations that the car maker illegally masked excess diesel emissions. Germany’s DAX <.GDAXI> was up 0.5 percent and Britain’s FTSE 100 <.FTSE> rose 0.4 percent, on course for its 12th record high close and 14th consecutive daily gain. U.S. futures pointed to a slightly higher open on Wall Street <ESc1>. Thursday’s slip into the red marked yet another failed attempt to lift the Dow Jones through the magical 20,000 points barrier <.DJI>. Wall Street was chilled by president-elect Donald Trump’s failure to address economic policy plans at his first news conference since winning the Nov. 8 election, and growing fears that his proposed protectionist trade policies will choke global trade. Chinese trade data on Friday poured oil onto those flames. December exports fell by 6.1 percent from a year earlier, meaning the overall fall in exports last year was the biggest since the depths of the crisis in 2009. As the world’s largest trading nation, China could come under pressure from protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on his campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on the country’s imports. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan <.MIAPJ0000PUS> slipped 0.1 percent, after rising to its highest levels since late October in the previous session. It was up 1.8 percent for the week. Japan’s Nikkei stock index <.N225> finished up 0.8 percent, though it still ended the week down 0.9 percent.   BOND YIELD RETRACEMENT The symbiotic dance between the dollar and U.S. Treasury bond yields held firm on Friday. Both headed lower to end a week in which has seen the dollar fall almost 1 percent and yields extend their longest downturn since last summer. The 10-year yield <US10YT=RR> was flat at 2.36 percent, recovering from a six-week low hit on Thursday. But it’s down more than 5 basis points on the week and around 30 bps since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in mid-December. The dollar wallowed around five-week lows against a currency basket <.DXY> at 101.29, and down 0.9 percent for the week. The euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.0635, well above last week’s 14-year low of $1.0340 <EUR=> and poised to gain 0.9 percent for the week, while the dollar was steady against the yen at 114.75 yen <JPY=>. The dollar index had scaled 14-year peaks this month, on speculation that Trump’s policies would spur growth and inflation, and prompt the Fed to raise interest rates at a faster pace than previously expected. But doubts have crept in. “Bond markets continue to retrace from the yield highs set in the middle of last month,” RBC Capital markets rates strategists wrote in a note to clients on Friday. “The latest move (is) seen as a typical ‘buy-the-rumor-sell-the-fact’ reaction as Donald Trump’s pre-inauguration press conference proved to be a disappointment in terms of forthcoming growth boosting policies,” they said. The overnight rise in crude oil prices, bolstered by the weaker dollar as well as news that Saudi Arabia has cut oil output to its lowest in almost two years and plans further reductions, fizzled out in early European trading. Brent crude <LCOc1> was down 0.1 percent at $55.95 a barrel, while U.S. crude <CLc1> was also down 0.1 percent at $52.97. Spot gold <XAU=> held steady at $1,195.87 an ounce, as investors locked in gains on its overnight surge to seven-week highs above $1,200.

Retail sales crept up for December, but clothing retailers recently have been closing stores and cutting jobs Comments aAFont Size NEW YORK -- Profits at JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America surged last year, the banks said Friday as the industry enjoyed a stock market rally that accelerated after the presidential election. The industry is entering what analysts say could be a period of renewed growth as rising interest rates make it easier for banks to earn a profit and President-elect Donald Trump has said he would roll back regulations put in place after the financial crisis that have hampered industry profits. Increased trading levels across U.S. markets, which are near record levels, has also helped the industry. JPMorgan and Bank of America, two of the largest banks in the world, both beat analysts' profit expectations and gave positive forecasts for the future. "The optimism for positive change here at Bank of America and among our customers is palpable," Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said on a conference call with analysts. The new administration has raised the prospect of a corporate tax overhaul and regulatory changes, Moynihan said. "We'll have to see how these topics play out but that we are optimistic," he said. The North Carolina bank reported its largest yearly profit, nearly $18 billion, or $1.50 a share, since the financial crisis. During the fourth quarter, net income jumped 43 percent to $4.7 billion, or 40 cents a share, compared with the same period in 2015 as Bank of America continued to cut costs. Revenue increased about 2 percent during the quarter to $20 billion. At JPMorgan, CEO Jamie Dimon also expressed optimism. "The U.S. economy may be building momentum," he said in a statement. "Looking ahead there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth." In a conference call, Dimon said he is "comforted" that Trump has picked "professionals" for his administration, including Treasury Department nominee Steven Mnuchin. "Give him some time," said Dimon, who is serving on Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum. JPMorgan's profits jumped 24 percent during the fourth quarter to $6.73 billion, or $1.71 a share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 a share, during the same period a year ago. For the entire year, profits were up about 1 percent to $24.7 billion, or $6.18 a share, while revenue reached more than $95 billion. "Our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year," Dimon said in a statement. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo lagged behind its competitors as it continues to recover from a sales scandal that put it in the cross hairs of lawmakers and sparked several federal investigations. In September, the bank admitted that thousands of low-level employees had set up sham accounts to meet sales quotas. In some cases, the customers were charged various fees for accounts they did not know existed. The bank has apologized repeatedly and refunded more than $3 million to customers for fees they were charged on accounts they didn't ask for. Earlier this week, the company announced a new pay plan that replaces the sales goals. But the scandal appears to still be weighing on its bottom line. Wells Fargo opened 40 percent fewer checking accounts and 43 percent fewer credit cards in December compared with the same period in 2015. It reported a 4 percent dip in profits last year, $21.9 billion, or $3.99 a share, compared with $22.9 billion, or $4.12 a share, in 2015. Revenue increased about 3 percent to $88.3 billion. During the fourth quarter, net income dipped to $5.3 billion, or 96 cents a share, at the San Francisco bank compared with $5.6 billion, or $1.03 a share, during the same period in 2015. Revenue was unchanged during the quarter at about $21 billion. "We continued to make progress in the fourth quarter in rebuilding the trust of our customers, team members and other key stakeholders," CEO Tim Sloan said in a statement. "While we have more work to do, I am proud of the effort of our entire team to make things right for our customers and team members and to continue building a better Wells Fargo for the future."

Investors largely shrugged off the biggest fall in Chinese exports since 2009 to focus on U.S. data that suggested stronger growth. Market participants largely resumed buying across equity markets based on higher growth expectations that had tailed off this week, with bank shares leading the way. Top U.S. bank executives, in their first public comments about quarterly earnings, expressed optimism about the outlook for this year as leading financial institutions recorded profits for the fourth quarter. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, for instance, reported a 47-percent rise in fourth-quarter profit, while JP Morgan Chase also reported strong earnings, with a 24-percent rise in profit. U.S. economic data have also boosted the market, as retail sales rose in December given strong demand for automobiles and furniture. Producer prices expanded as well. "Our medium-term view is still positive on the stock market," said Allan von Mehren, chief analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen. "Donald Trump is seen as a positive factor for stocks in the longer term as he begins to execute on his plans of reducing taxes and rebuilding U.S. infrastructure." The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. The dollar, meanwhile, was down 0.16 percent against a basket of major currencies at 101.19, but was off a five-week low hit this week. The greenback was down 0.2 percent at 114.54 yen. The dollar index, though, posted its worst weekly performance in more than two months. "Markets, overall, have stabilized following the post-Trump press conference shake-up," said Action Economics in its latest blog. "Some consolidation is expected now (in dollar/yen), though should data continue to strengthen, keeping Fedspeak leaning to the hawkish side, dollar/yen upside can be expected to resume." The 'reflation trade' that had sent the dollar to a 14-year high last month was based on Trump's campaign promises of increased fiscal spending, lower taxes, and deregulation, all of which are inflationary and would likely drive the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than its normal pace. U.S. Treasury yields rose across the board, bolstered by Friday's better-than-expected data, led by U.S. retail sales, producer prices, as well as the big rise in U.S. inflation expectations as shown in the University of Michigan consumer sentiment report. Benchmark U.S. 10-year yields fell 10/32 in price, yielding 2.4 percent, up from Thursday's 2.361 percent. German 10-year bond yields were also higher, up at 0.264 percent, from 0.234 percent late on Thursday. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 1 percent to 1,447.22. Germany's DAX rose 0.94 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.62 percent, its 14th consecutive daily gain. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.1 percent after rising to its highest since late October the previous session. It was up 1.8 percent for the week. Japan's Nikkei stock index finished up 0.8 percent, though it still ended the week down 0.9 percent. Brent crude was down 0.8 percent at $55.59 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 0.9 percent at $52.53. Spot gold was up 0.2 percent at $1,197.90 an ounce, having risen overnight to a seven-week high above $1,200.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel An increase in Facebook pushed the Nasdaq to a record high on Friday and the S&P 500 also rose after major US banks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season with strong results. Wall Street has surged since President-elect Donald Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at price-to-earnings valuations well above historical averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo ended 1.36 percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.53 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, far outpacing the S&P 500's 6-percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of US Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow dipped marginally, with Wal-Mart Stores and other consumer stocks down after a report showed US retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light, with financial markets closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. For the week, the Dow fell 0.4 percent, the S&P 500 shed 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1 percent. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Friday was provided by Facebook , which jumped 1.36 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters. The S&P 500 is trading at 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Bank stocks will stay in favour with investors as long as earnings reports in the coming week keep show an improving profit outlook while investors wait to see if Trump lives up to his campaign promises. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.34-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 14 new lows.

He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

Quotes in the article Bank of America Corporation BAC ▲ 23.01 +0.09 +0.39% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▲ 86.70 +0.46 +0.53% Wells Fargo & Co WFC ▲ 55.31 +0.81 +1.49% The performance of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. was largely in line with what Wall Street had been expecting: trading revenue was upbeat thanks to increased market activity and volatility following the election; expenses remain an area of intense focus; credit quality continues to improve; and a recent upward move in interest rates should produce gains in banks’ income, even if it doesn’t immediately flow to the bottom line. Investors viewed the results positively enough that they continued to nudge the banks’ stocks higher, even though they have each already gained more than 20% since the election. J.P. Morgan, the country’s biggest bank by assets and the world’s largest by market value, was the standout. Its quarterly profit of $1.71 a share handily outpaced analyst expectations, largely due to strong trading results. Full-year 2016 net income of $24.73 billion was a record. Bank of America’s earnings per share of 40 cents beat analyst expectations as the bank cut enough expenses to offset lower-than-expected revenue. At $17.91 billion, its 2016 net income was its biggest annual profit in a decade. Wells Fargo reported lower fourth-quarter earnings and revenue, at 96 cents a share and $21.58 billion, that both missed analysts’ expectations. The bank’s shares, though, rose after it repeatedly referenced a charge related to interest-rate moves as the reason for coming in below estimates. Wells Fargo said its customer loyalty and satisfaction scores were still down versus a year earlier as the bank struggles to recover from its September sales-tactics scandal. Going forward, the burden is on banks to live up to heightened investor expectations while showing that increased profits are sustainable. And while investors now believe a turn in the interest-rate cycle is at hand, which would bolster bank profits, rates remain super low by historical standards. That continues to drag on results: Wells Fargo’s quarterly return on equity hit its lowest level in years at 10.94%. Finance chief John Shrewsberry acknowledged that the market has lifted bank valuations based on no more than current performance. “Now banks need to, over some period of time, demonstrate how they’re going to earn into that,” he said in an interview. At Bank of America, CLSA analyst Mike Mayo asked officials for a timeline on when they might meet goals on profitability measures such as return on assets and equity. Bank of America’s return on equity in 2016 was just 6.71%, its highest level in five years but still well below banks’ theoretical cost of capital of 10%. CFO Paul Donofrio replied to Mr. Mayo that the bank was moving in the right direction but wouldn’t set a time frame. “It seems like, from an investor standpoint, you get a free pass,” Mr. Mayo said. “‘When you get there is when you get there.’” Speaking a week before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, bank officials offered vague support for tax reform and regulatory relief, but didn’t enumerate specific requests they might want from the new administration. They also expressed optimism about the economy over the coming year. Among specific businesses, trading continued to gain ground. After a brutal start in 2016, trading activity ramped up following the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union in June and accelerated further after Mr. Trump’s election. At J.P. Morgan and Bank of America, annual trading revenue for 2016 increased above their year-earlier levels for the first time in at least three years. In the fourth quarter, J.P. Morgan’s trading revenue rose 24%, and Bank of America’s rose 11%. Wells Fargo’s relatively small presence in trading has sometimes been an advantage in recent years but has been a handicap of late. Still, it isn’t clear how long the trading jolt can continue. Bank of America noted the postelection rise in long-term bond yields had slowed demand for trading municipal bonds and other products tied to interest rates. Consumer banking was less buoyant: revenue was down at J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo versus the prior year, and flat at Bank of America. Mortgage-banking revenue was also challenged due to the rise in interest rates and looks set to continue falling this year. Reflecting a continued emphasis on cost control, executives held the line on pay for traders and investment bankers. Compensation expenses in J.P. Morgan’s corporate and investment bank was 20% of revenue in the fourth quarter, down from 27% in the third. The cost-cutting drive continued in other parts of banks. Bank of America’s Mr. Moynihan has made expense savings a key part of his business strategy, and the company cut annual expenses nearly 5% to $54.95 billion. Mr. Moynihan promised this summer to reduce annual expenses to about $53 billion by 2018. On the plus side, all three banks released reserves they had set aside for loan losses, in part due to continued improvement in credit quality. Such reserve releases bolster profit. As well, the rebound in energy prices removed one of the biggest challenges to bank profitability. The Federal Reserve’s December decision to raise interest rates had little immediate impact on the banks’ fourth-quarter results, but made them hopeful about the coming year. At Bank of America, officials said they expect an extra $600 million in net interest income in the first quarter, compared with the bank’s $10.3 billion in the fourth quarter. Bank of America is particularly dependent on the Fed increasing interest rates because of its large base of U.S. deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities.

Investors largely shrugged off the biggest fall in Chinese exports since 2009 to focus on U.S. data that suggested stronger growth. Market participants largely resumed buying across equity markets based on higher growth expectations that had tailed off this week, with bank shares leading the way. Top U.S. bank executives, in their first public comments about quarterly earnings, expressed optimism about the outlook for this year as leading financial institutions recorded profits for the fourth quarter. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, for instance, reported a 47-percent rise in fourth-quarter profit, while JP Morgan Chase also reported strong earnings, with a 24-percent rise in profit. U.S. economic data have also boosted the market, as retail sales rose in December given strong demand for automobiles and furniture. Producer prices expanded as well. "Our medium-term view is still positive on the stock market," said Allan von Mehren, chief analyst at Danske Bank in Copenhagen. "Donald Trump is seen as a positive factor for stocks in the longer term as he begins to execute on his plans of reducing taxes and rebuilding U.S. infrastructure." The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. The dollar, meanwhile, was down 0.16 percent against a basket of major currencies at 101.19, but was off a five-week low hit this week. The greenback was down 0.2 percent at 114.54 yen. The dollar index, though, posted its worst weekly performance in more than two months. "Markets, overall, have stabilized following the post-Trump press conference shake-up," said Action Economics in its latest blog. "Some consolidation is expected now (in dollar/yen), though should data continue to strengthen, keeping Fedspeak leaning to the hawkish side, dollar/yen upside can be expected to resume." The 'reflation trade' that had sent the dollar to a 14-year high last month was based on Trump's campaign promises of increased fiscal spending, lower taxes, and deregulation, all of which are inflationary and would likely drive the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster than its normal pace. U.S. Treasury yields rose across the board, bolstered by Friday's better-than-expected data, led by U.S. retail sales, producer prices, as well as the big rise in U.S. inflation expectations as shown in the University of Michigan consumer sentiment report. Benchmark U.S. 10-year yields fell 10/32 in price, yielding 2.4 percent, up from Thursday's 2.361 percent. German 10-year bond yields were also higher, up at 0.264 percent, from 0.234 percent late on Thursday. Europe's broad FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 1 percent to 1,447.22. Germany's DAX rose 0.94 percent and Britain's FTSE 100 rose 0.62 percent, its 14th consecutive daily gain. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.1 percent after rising to its highest since late October the previous session. It was up 1.8 percent for the week. Japan's Nikkei stock index finished up 0.8 percent, though it still ended the week down 0.9 percent. Brent crude was down 0.8 percent at $55.59 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 0.9 percent at $52.53. Spot gold was up 0.2 percent at $1,197.90 an ounce, having risen overnight to a seven-week high above $1,200.

Wall Street has surged since President-elect Donald Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at price-to-earnings valuations well above historical averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America <BAC.N>, JPMorgan <JPM.N> and Wells Fargo <WFC.N> all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo ended 1.36 percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.53 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, far outpacing the S&P 500's 6-percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow dipped marginally, with Wal-Mart Stores <WMT.N> and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light, with financial markets closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73, while the S&P 500 <.SPX> gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. For the week, the Dow fell 0.4 percent, the S&P 500 shed 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1 percent. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Friday was provided by Facebook <FB.O>, which jumped 1.36 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P 500 is trading at 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Bank stocks will stay in favor with investors as long as earnings reports in the coming week keep show an improving profit outlook while investors wait to see if Trump lives up to his campaign promises. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.34-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 14 new lows. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, lower than the 6.4 billion average in the last 20 sessions.

Wall Street has surged since President-elect Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at price-to-earnings valuations well above historical averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America , JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo ended 1.36-percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.53 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, far outpacing the S&P 500's 6-percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow dipped marginally, with Wal-Mart Stores and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light, with financial markets closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12 points, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. For the week, the Dow fell 0.4 percent, the S&P 500 shed 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1 percent. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Friday was provided by Facebook, which jumped 1.36 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P 500 is trading at 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14 times expected earnings, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.34-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 14 new lows. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, lower than the 6.4 billion average in the last 20 sessions.

By Abby Schultz Jan. 13, 2017 4:15 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Illustration: Pixabay JPMorgan Chase slashed the outsized sign-up bonus for its high-end travel card Chase Sapphire Reserve this week, but the bank is offering a sweet new deal that could entice those who missed out – that is if you’re an Amazon Prime Member. The new Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card unveiled this week offers 5% cash back on anything Amazon Prime members buy at Amazon.com. It also gives 2% cash back spent at any restaurant, gas station or drugstore and 1% back on every other purchase. And there’s no annual fee. Amazon Prime membership itself costs $99 a year. For those keeping track at home, the two cards – Sapphire Reserve and Amazon Prime Rewards – offer very different perks and are issued from different units in Chase’s card division (The Amazon card is considered a “co-branded” card). Chase says the timing is coincidental. We just think it’s interesting. Chase Sapphire Reserve is great if you travel and dine out a lot and can take advantage of the many potential rewards it offers in exchange for a hefty $450 annual fee. Sadly, Chase cut the sign-up bonus on Sapphire Reserve from 100,000 points (a $1,500 travel value) to 50,000 points (a $750 value) this week. You can still get the higher bonus, though, if you walk into a Chase bank branch and apply. The branch offer lasts through March 12. One similarity is both cards only make sense if you pay your balance in full each month. Otherwise any benefit from the cards is wiped away by finance charges of at least 14.74% for Amazon Prime and 16.49% for Sapphire Reserve, depending on your credit score. More from Barron's When to Buy Airline Tickets to Get the Cheapest Fare Best Credit Cards for Holiday Spending This Trick Lets You Live (Nearly) Rent Free A better comparison for the Amazon Prime card is Chase Freedom, a no annual fee card with 5% cash back on a rotating set of categories and 1% cash back on everything else. That rotating category list includes gas stations and local commuter transportation, and grocery stores and drug stores. The list has at times included Amazon.com. Discover’s Discover It card has also included Amazon in its own rotating 5% cash back program. Though it’s worth nothing that Discover doubles the reward in the first year. https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/cash-back/it-card.html But Chase’s new Amazon card is the first one to offer full-time Amazon rewards. John Ganotis, founder of Credit Card Insider, says the card “looks like a great deal for anyone who uses Amazon Prime.” With no annual fee it’s a card that a Prime member could consider opening up just for Amazon purchases, he says. If you already have one, you can still hold onto your cash back card like Chase Freedom or Discover It. “All of these cards have no annual fee, and credit scoring models generally like to see more accounts and more available credit,” Ganotis says. Chase offers what it calls “co-branded” cards with 10 partners like Amazon as well as United, Marriott, and Disney, among others. It’s had a relationship with Amazon for nearly 20 years, says Steve Goodman, Chase’s Card Services general manager, and Chase still offers all Amazon members an Amazon Rewards Visa Signature Card with 3% cash back on Amazon.com purchases, 2% back on gas and 1% back on everything else. Current Amazon.com card holders who are Prime members will be automatically upgraded to the new card. If you’re not a member, you’ll still get a redesigned card that now has no foreign transaction fees -- same as the Prime card.

U.S. stock indexes moved higher in early trading Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 as investors pored over earnings reports from several big lenders. Banks and other financial companies were up the most. Utilities were the biggest laggard. Energy stocks also fell as crude oil prices headed lower. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer, File) Posted: Friday, January 13, 2017 12:16 pm | Updated: 12:34 pm, Fri Jan 13, 2017. US stock indexes end mostly higher on solid bank earnings Associated Press | 0 comments Banks led U.S. stock indexes mostly higher Friday, propelling the Nasdaq composite index to its fourth record high this week. Investors welcomed quarterly earnings from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, all of which reported results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Financial stocks also benefited from an upward move in bond yields, which drives higher interest rates on loans. Real estate stocks were the biggest laggard. Shares in energy companies also closed lower as crude oil prices declined. Mixed data on U.S. retail sales weighed on department store stocks. Friday's crop of company earnings kicks off several weeks of corporate earnings reports, giving investors new insight into the health of Corporate America and the economy. "We all thought financials would do well," said J.J. Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief strategist. "Now how about the other areas of the economy?" The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 5.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 19,885.73. The average had been up by 61 points earlier in the day. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gained 4.20 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,274.64. The Nasdaq added 26.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,574.12. The index has set a record-high close six times this year. Small-company stocks rose more than the rest of the market. The Russell 2000 index jumped 10.98 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,372.05. The major stock indexes headed higher early on in the day, as investors reacted to earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. The three banking giants delivered quarterly results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, pushing their shares higher. JPMorgan added 46 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $86.70. Bank of America rose 9 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $23.01. Wells Fargo gained 81 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $55.31. Traders also reviewed the latest monthly snapshot of U.S. retail sales, which showed that sales rose 0.6 percent overall in December, mainly due to a pickup in online shopping and sales of autos and gasoline. "If you back out gasoline increasing and auto sales increasing, it's not an impressive number," Kinahan said. The retail sales report weighed down shares of several department store chains and clothing brands. By early afternoon, the market had begun to give up some of its gains. PVH Corp., home to Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and other clothing brands, slid $3.82, or 4.1 percent, to $89.31. Nordstrom fell 83 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $44.20. Gap shed 34 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $23.66. Traders also had their eye on companies that issued outlooks for their upcoming earnings reports. Pandora Media climbed 6.3 percent after the streaming music company issued a strong revenue forecast. The company also said it will cut about 7 percent of its jobs to reduce costs. The stock added 76 cents to $12.765. HomeStreet fell 6 percent after the real estate lender forecast disappointing fourth-quarter results. It took in fewer mortgage applications as interest rates began rising. The stock slid $1.85 to $29.10. GameStop tumbled 8.1 percent after the video game retailer said holiday revenue dropped because of discounts and weak sales of new "Call of Duty" and "Titanfall" games. The stock shed $1.99 to $22.73. Energy prices were mixed. Benchmark crude oil fell 64 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $52.37 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price oil sold internationally, slid 56 cents, or 1 percent, to close at $55.45 a barrel in London. The slide in crude prices helped pull down shares in energy sector stocks. Oilfield services company Baker Hughes slid $1.50, or 2.4 percent, to $60.92, while drilling services company Transocean lost 36 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $15.48. Marathon Petroleum fell 87 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $48.38. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline was little changed at $1.61 a gallon, while heating oil slipped 2 cents to $1.65 a gallon. Natural gas futures gained 3 cents, or 1 percent, to $3.42 per 1,000 cubic feet. Major stock indexes in Europe closed higher. Germany's DAX rose 0.9 percent, while France's CAC 40 gained 1.2 percent. Britain's FTSE 100 added 0.6 percent. Earlier in Asia, some markets finished lower on disappointing trade data from China. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained 0.5 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index rose 0.8 percent. South Korea's Kospi fell 0.5 percent, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slumped 0.8 percent. Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.39 percent from 2.36 percent late Thursday. In currency trading, the dollar fell to 114.42 yen from 114.63 yen on Thursday. The euro strengthened to $1.0646 from $1.0626. The price of gold fell $3.60 to $1,196.20 an ounce. Silver slid 6 cents to $16.77 an ounce. Copper rose 2 cents to $2.69 a pound. © 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

The Globe and Mail Published Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 5:24PM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 5:26PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn PrintLicense article U.S. banks benefit from postelection trading surge Robust gains in fixed income trading revenue at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. are an early sign that a surge in activity after the U.S. election was felt across bond markets. And those strong fourth-quarter results are buttressing expectations that Canadian banks also benefited from that trend. U.S. banks were expected to handle more trading orders during the three months that ended Dec. 31, as their clients adjusted their portfolios after Donald Trump’s surprise presidential election victory in November triggered a selloff of U.S. government bonds. Story Scotiabank energy banker launches oil and gas PE fund Over the past few years, energy company executives have been telling Adam Waterous that despite the negative headlines, there has never been a better time to be exploring for oil and gas. The global head of investment banking at Bank of Nova Scotia heard this advice so many times that he decided to act on it: Mr. Waterous plans to leave the bank next month to launch a Calgary-based $400-million private equity fund that will invest in up-and-coming North American oil and gas plays. Story A Trump-induced euphoria for banks? Not so fast Less than two weeks left of this tyranny. Then we’ll be free from the socialists, the overreaching regulators, the long arm of government. That’s the subtext to the euphoria on Wall Street and in the American banking sector since Donald Trump was elected president. The KBW Regional Bank Index, which tracks 50 U.S. banks, is up an astonishing 27 per cent since Nov. 8. With the inauguration approaching, investors are assuming a Republican-led Congress will free banks from the shackles imposed by U.S. President Barack Obama and other policy makers after the 2008 financial crisis. Story MEG boosts stock deal to $450-million MEG Energy Corp.’s chief executive officer says the company has turned a corner with a deal to refinance its hefty debt load and plans to restart growth in the oil sands using proceeds from an upsized share sale. The Calgary-based company issued $450-million in stock on Thursday, selling 58.1 million subscription receipts at $7.75 apiece. The syndicate is co-led by BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc., Barclays PLC and RBC Dominion Securities Inc.

The Globe and Mail Published Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 5:24PM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 5:26PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn PrintLicense article U.S. banks benefit from postelection trading surge Robust gains in fixed income trading revenue at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. are an early sign that a surge in activity after the U.S. election was felt across bond markets. And those strong fourth-quarter results are buttressing expectations that Canadian banks also benefited from that trend. U.S. banks were expected to handle more trading orders during the three months that ended Dec. 31, as their clients adjusted their portfolios after Donald Trump’s surprise presidential election victory in November triggered a selloff of U.S. government bonds. Story Scotiabank energy banker launches oil and gas PE fund Over the past few years, energy company executives have been telling Adam Waterous that despite the negative headlines, there has never been a better time to be exploring for oil and gas. The global head of investment banking at Bank of Nova Scotia heard this advice so many times that he decided to act on it: Mr. Waterous plans to leave the bank next month to launch a Calgary-based $400-million private equity fund that will invest in up-and-coming North American oil and gas plays. Story A Trump-induced euphoria for banks? Not so fast Less than two weeks left of this tyranny. Then we’ll be free from the socialists, the overreaching regulators, the long arm of government. That’s the subtext to the euphoria on Wall Street and in the American banking sector since Donald Trump was elected president. The KBW Regional Bank Index, which tracks 50 U.S. banks, is up an astonishing 27 per cent since Nov. 8. With the inauguration approaching, investors are assuming a Republican-led Congress will free banks from the shackles imposed by U.S. President Barack Obama and other policy makers after the 2008 financial crisis. Story MEG boosts stock deal to $450-million MEG Energy Corp.’s chief executive officer says the company has turned a corner with a deal to refinance its hefty debt load and plans to restart growth in the oil sands using proceeds from an upsized share sale. The Calgary-based company issued $450-million in stock on Thursday, selling 58.1 million subscription receipts at $7.75 apiece. The syndicate is co-led by BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc., Barclays PLC and RBC Dominion Securities Inc.

Idaho Business Health Nation/World Elections Photos Business Profits at big banks surged last year as ‘Trump rally’ boosts bottom line FRIDAY, JAN. 13, 2017, 2 P.M. By Renae Merle The Washington Post Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS NEW YORK – Profits at JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America surged last year, the banks said Friday as the industry receives a boost from a stock market rally that accelerated after the presidential election. The industry is entering what analysts say could be a period of renewed growth as rising interest rates make it easier for banks to earn a profit and President-elect Donald Trump has said he would roll back regulations put in place after the financial crisis that have hampered industry profits. Increased trading levels across U.S. markets, which are near record levels, has also boosted the industry. JPMorgan and Bank of America, two of the largest banks in the world, both beat analysts profit expectations and gave positive forecasts for the future. “The optimism for positive change here at Bank of America and among our customers is palpable,” Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said on a conference call with analysts. The new administration has raised the prospect of corporate tax reform and regulatory changes, Moynihan said. “We’ll have to see how these topics play out but that we are optimistic,” he said. The North Carolina bank reported its largest yearly profit, nearly $18 billion, or $1.50 a share, since the financial crisis. During the fourth quarter, net income jumped 43 percent to $4.7 billion, or 40 cents a share, compared to the same period in 2015 as Bank of America continued to cut costs. Revenue increased about 2 percent during the quarter to $20 billion. At JPMorgan, CEO, Jamie Dimon, also expressed optimism. “The U.S. economy may be building momentum,” he said in a statement. “Looking ahead there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth.” In a conference call, Dimon said he is “comforted” that Trump has picked “professionals” for his administration, including Treasury Department nominee Steven Mnuchin. “Give him some time,” said Dimon, who is serving on Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum. JPMorgan’s profits jumped 24 percent during the fourth quarter to $6.73 billion, or $1.71 a share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 a share, during the same period a year ago. For the entire year, profits were up about 1 percent to $24.7 ($6.18 a share) billion while revenue reached more than $95 billion. “Our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year,” Dimon said in a statement. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo lagged its competitors as it continues to recover from a sales scandal that put it in the crosshairs of lawmakers and sparked several federal investigations. Last September, the bank admitted that thousands of low-level employees had set up sham accounts to meet sales quotas. In some cases, the customers were charged various fees for accounts they did not know existed. The bank has apologized repeatedly and refunded more than $3 million to customers for fees they were charged on accounts they didn’t ask for. Earlier this week, the company announced a new pay plan which replaces the sales goals. But the scandal appears to still be weighing on its bottom line. Wells Fargo opened 40 percent fewer checking accounts and 43 percent fewer credit cards in December compared with the same period in 2015. It reported a 4 percent dip in profits last year, $21.9 billion, or $3.99 a share, compared with $22.9 billion, or $4.12 a share, in 2015. Revenue increased about 3 percent to $88.3 billion. During the fourth quarter, net income dipped to $5.3 billion, or 96 cents a share, at the San Francisco bank compared with $5.6 billion ($1.03) during the same period in 2015. Revenue was flat during the quarter at about $21 billion. “We continued to make progress in the fourth quarter in rebuilding the trust of our customers, team members and other key stakeholders,” CEO Tim Sloan said in a statement. “While we have more work to do, I am proud of the effort of our entire team to make things right for our customers and team members and to continue building a better Wells Fargo for the future.” Published: Jan. 13, 2017, 2 p.m.  Tags: banking, banking regulations, Bank of America, bank profits, banks, Donald Trump, financial crisis, interest rates, JPMorgan Chase, stock market rally Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Posted 13 Jan 2017 20:35 Updated 14 Jan 2017 08:55 Traders work on the floor at the close of trading at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., December 28, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: An increase in Facebook pushed the Nasdaq to a record high on Friday and the S&P 500 also rose after major U.S. banks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season with strong results. Wall Street has surged since President-elect Donald Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at price-to-earnings valuations well above historical averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America , JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo ended 1.36 percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.53 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, far outpacing the S&P 500's 6-percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow dipped marginally, with Wal-Mart Stores and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light, with financial markets closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. For the week, the Dow fell 0.4 percent, the S&P 500 shed 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1 percent. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Friday was provided by Facebook , which jumped 1.36 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P 500 is trading at 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Bank stocks will stay in favor with investors as long as earnings reports in the coming week keep show an improving profit outlook while investors wait to see if Trump lives up to his campaign promises. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.34-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and three new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 14 new lows. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, lower than the 6.4 billion average in the last 20 sessions.

(JPM) reported record earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 (4Q16) driven by: core loan growth of 12%, record card sales volume growth of 14%, record fourth quarter markets activity, reserve releases in consumer and wholesale portfolios, and continued expense controls, according to Fitch Ratings. Returns on equity and tangible equity were 11% and 14% in the quarter, respectively, which is above average for the peer group. Full-year results for 2016 were also at record levels, with reported earnings up about 1.2% year-over-year. Adjusted expenses were in-line with management guidance, at about $56.1 billion, which was relatively flat with the prior year as strategic cost savings programs largely offset investments in controls. Net charge-offs for the year met Fitch's expectations, at $4.7 billion. Charge-offs were up about 14.8% from 2015, driven by loan growth, portfolio seasoning, and about $270 million of losses from oil & gas and metals & mining portfolios. JPM recorded a $400 million net reserve release in 4Q16, consisting of a $250 million release in consumer portfolios, largely mortgage, and a $150 million release related to oil & gas and metals and mining portfolios in the wholesale book. Fourth quarter net revenues in the corporate and investment bank (CIB) were up 19.7% year-over-year, driven by a record fourth quarter in the markets business. Overall markets revenue was up 24.2% annually, with nearly 31% growth in fixed-income products, driven by spread products and more active hedging in commodities products. Equities were up 8%, led by stronger derivatives activity. Investment banking fees were up about 5% as declines in advisory and equity underwriting was more than offset by stronger debt underwriting, given a relatively weak 4Q15. JPM maintained its leading market share in a variety of product categories for the year and was the only top five bank to gain share in investment banking in 2016, according to the company. Segment earnings nearly doubled given reserve releases in energy-portfolios, reduced compensation expenses, tight operating costs controls, and a $475 million tax benefit related to the use of deferred tax assets. The compensation expense ratio was 20% in the quarter and 27% for the full-year, which was an improvement over 2015. Revenue and earnings in the Consumer and Community Banking (CCB) segment were down modestly year over year, as strong loan and deposit growth, record card sales volume, declines in credit costs, and continued expense discipline were offset by higher account origination costs in card and the absence of a gain on the IPO of Square, recognized in 4Q15. Segment credit quality remained strong and drove $425 million of reserve releases in the mortgage book and $25 million of releases in the student loan portfolio, which were only partially offset by a build in card and business banking. The commercial banking segment reported record revenue, supported by continued loan growth and higher investment banking revenue. Average loan balances were up 13.9% year over year, led by growth in commercial & industrial loans and commercial real estate (CRE). Growth in these portfolios is outpacing the peer group, but segment credit quality remained relatively benign, with net charge-offs of 11 basis points in the quarter. Management indicated that about 75% of the CRE portfolio was multifamily lending, in strong properties and underserved markets, while the remaining 25% was to real estate developers the firm knows well. The CRE book has had no net losses. Segment investment banking revenue was a record for the year, at $2.3 billion, which was up 4.9% from 2015. Asset management remained a solid contributor to overall results, with revenues up and expenses down modestly. Flows into long-term products were negative in the quarter, but positive for the year. Assets under management were up 2.8% annually, with higher markets and overall net inflows. From a liquidity perspective, JPM's high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) remained strong, at $524 billion. Loans-to-deposits were down modestly from a year ago, to 65.1%, despite strong loan growth, and remains below the peer average. JPM's Basel III Tier 1 Common equity (CET1) ratio was up 30 basis points in the quarter, to 12.2%, given strong earnings and a decline in risk-weighted assets. The bank's capital ratio was 12.3% under the fully phased-in standardized approach and JPM believes the standardized ratio will eventually be the binding constraint. The supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) was 6.5% and 6.6% at the firm and bank level, respectively. JPM paid a dividend of $0.48 per share in the quarter, equating to a payout of about 28%. The bank repurchased $2.25 billion of equity in the quarter, leaving approximately $6.1 billion of repurchase authority for the next two quarters, based on the results of last year's CCAR process. Including share repurchases, the total payout in the quarter was about 65%.

Reuters Published Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 4:14PM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 4:17PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Canada’s main stock index ended higher on Friday, to finish a tumultuous week almost unchanged, as higher bond yields and solid U.S. bank earnings helped boost the index’s heavyweight financials sector. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index unofficially closed up 79.12 points, or 0.51 per cent, at 15,497.28. Eight of its main sectors rose. Some of the most influential movers on the index were banks, with Royal Bank of Canada climbing 0.8 per cent and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce up 0.3 per cent. Gains for Canadian bank stocks came as some major U.S. banks reported quarterly profits that beat expectations and bond yields rose after data showed U.S. retail sales rose solidly in December. Higher bond yields increase net interest margins of banks and reduce the value of insurance companies’ liabilities. Manulife Financial Corprose rose 0.4 per cent to $24.81, while the overall financials group gained 0.5 per cent. The S&P 500 rose on Friday after major U.S. banks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season with strong results, making investors more confident about heady valuations after a recent market rally, while the Nasdaq closed at a record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.34 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 19,885.66, the S&P 500 gained 4.2 points, or 0.18 per cent, to 2,274.64 and the Nasdaq Composite added 26.63 points, or 0.48 per cent, to 5,574.12. Wall Street has surged since President-elect Trump’s unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at valuations well above historic averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America , JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts’ expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Mr. Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 per cent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo was 1.5 per cent higher and JPMorgan added 0.5 per cent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 per cent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500’s 6.1-per-cent rise. “Earnings are key going forward, and we’re off to a decent start,” said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow declined, with McDonald’s and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light ahead of a three-day weekend. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We’ve come a long way very quickly so there’s scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive,” said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Oil prices fell on Friday and ended the week 3 per cent lower on lingering doubts over the extent of OPEC cuts, with sentiment worsened by concerns over the economic health of the world’s second-largest oil consumer, China, after it reported the steepest falls in overall exports since 2009. Record Chinese crude imports of 8.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in December helped to buoy prices somewhat, traders said, but they could not hide underlying fears over the overall health of the world’s second-biggest economy. Brent crude futures settled 56 cents lower at $55.45 a barrel, ending the week with a loss of about 3 per cent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell by 64 cents to close at $52.37 also notching a weekly drop of nearly 3 per cent. “China right now seems more interested in keeping capital in the country than focusing on growth overall,” Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago said. “We have to watch this situation develop because this is one threat to what is an otherwise wildly bullish scenario for oil in the coming year.” On the supply side, there was some market support from top crude exporter Saudi Arabia, which said that its output had fallen below 10 million bpd to levels last seen in February 2015 and that it expects to make even deeper cuts next month. However, hard evidence of export reductions has yet to emerge, two weeks into the month in which the cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers, such as Russia, were supposed to start. “Compliance won’t be 100 percent; it never is,” an OPEC source told Reuters, adding that an overall rate of 50 percent to 60 percent would be good enough, based on past compliance levels. Although, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo told Reuters he was sure countries would follow through on the deal. Libya’s oil production increased to 750,000 barrels per day (bpd), the deputy leader of the U.N.-backed government said, a rise of about 50,000 bpd from last week. “I think the bigger issues for oil are less about demand right now and a lot more about the supply condition,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. “EIA data and our own government policies have to leave you thinking that a U.S. production response may unwind all the production cuts Saudi Arabia and others are planning.” Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed crude production rose notably last week, particularly in the lower 48 states. Overall production was 8.95 million bpd last week, the most since April of last year. Saudi Arabia is likely to cut heavy oil production rather than light in order to maximize revenues, and as U.S. supply comes back, more light barrels will likely enter the market, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note. U.S. oil drillers cut rigs this week for only the second week in the last seven months, seen by traders as a pause in a recovery expected to last into 2018.

Wall Street has surged since President-elect Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at price-to-earnings valuations well above historical averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks.

They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo ended 1.36-percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.53 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, far outpacing the S&P 500's 6-percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow dipped marginally, with Wal-Mart Stores and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light, with financial markets closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.48 percent to a record-high close of 5,574.12 points, bringing its gain so far this year to 3.55 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.03 percent to 19,885.73 points, while the S&P 500 gained 0.18 percent to 2,274.64. For the week, the Dow fell 0.4 percent, the S&P 500 shed 0.1 percent and the Nasdaq gained 1 percent. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq on Friday was provided by Facebook, which jumped 1.36 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The S&P 500 is trading at 17 times expected earnings, compared to its 10-year average of 14 times expected earnings, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.69-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.34-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 126 new highs and 14 new lows. About 5.8 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, lower than the 6.4 billion average in the last 20 sessions.

When Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid. (Photo: Jae C. Hong, AP) 3 CONNECTTWEET 5 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE NEW YORK — When Rafael Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company's income taxes had to be paid. "Even if you have a good amount in the bank, it's not really your money till you pay your taxes," says Romis, owner of Weberous Web Design. "At the end of the year, it disappeared and we started the new year completely strapped." Romis, whose company is located in Los Angeles, had to use personal savings to restore Weberous' cash reserves. "Cash is king" is an axiom business owners try to live by. If revenue isn't coming in, and owners can't get loans or investors, there's no way to run day-to-day operations, buy inventory and equipment or hire workers. But many companies struggle to maintain a healthy cash flow and create a buffer for an event like a storm that keeps customers home. Companies with cash problems often have overestimated how much revenue they'd have and underestimated expenses, says George Solomon, a George Washington University management professor. It's especially a problem for new owners. These owners may also not be adequately prepared for the seasonality of their business, or for the slow payment practices of their customers — particularly if the customer is a government. "They can literally have millions of dollars on their book in terms of procurement (contracts) for the federal government and literally be filing for bankruptcy," Solomon says. USA TODAY Abrams: 7 steps to small-business success in 2017 Businesses like restaurants with low profit margins are particularly at risk of running through their cash buffers, since any interruption to their revenue can put them in danger of closing. Massachusetts restaurants and retailers had a 50% drop in revenue between Jan. 26 and Feb. 22, 2015, as massive snowstorms hit the state, according to Boston University researchers. Hidden Boston, a website that tracks restaurant openings and closings, counted 20 restaurants that shut down in the metropolitan area in March 2015, compared to 11 a year earlier and five in March 2013. When JPMorgan Chase & Co. studied 597,000 of its small business customers last year, it found their cash flow was lower than expected. Half the businesses had cash reserves that would last just 27 days. Restaurants had the smallest buffer, 16 days, while repair and maintenance businesses had 18 and retailers had 19. Personal service providers like hairdressers and dry cleaners had 21. The biggest buffer, 47 days, was held by real estate companies. The median small company had an average daily cash balance of $12,100, and personal service providers averaged just $5,300. "The typical small business has a low margin of error in the face of economic headwinds and shocks," JPMorgan Chase said. Romis says his cash flow has improved as the company has grown, and he now aims to have a two-month cash buffer. If business slows, he's willing to take on smaller projects — ones that will bring in $8,500 compared to $10,000 for his company's more typical jobs — to keep cash coming in. He considered using credit cards, but when he took at $7,500 cash advance on a card with a $15,000 credit line, the bank immediately reduced his limit to $7,500, eliminating that alternative. Tate Tullis has learned to bank money during his road sign company's busy months to give Sign Wise a buffer equal to 20% of its annual revenue. The 3-year-old business gets most of its sales during warmer weather, since during the winter fewer roads and parking lots are being built or overhauled. USA TODAY Abrams: Entrepreneurs! On your marks, get set ... shred When business drops off, the Logan, Utah, company looks at its inventory and raw materials like aluminum, assesses how much it really needs, and sells the surplus. It also does more marketing to overseas customers. All these steps leave Tullis feeling comfortable with his company's cash position. "If everything went south, we'd probably have enough cash for two or three months," he says. The recession taught many business owners some lessons about cash flow, says Thomas Basilo, a certified public accountant with Withum Smith & Brown in Morristown, New Jersey. They've given themselves more wiggle room negotiating flexible payment terms with vendors, sometimes as long as 90 days after an invoice is sent. They've also gotten better terms from lenders. Weberous Web Design CEO Rafael Romis poses for photos in his home, in Los Angeles. When Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid.  (Photo: Jae C. Hong, AP) Many startup owners forgo a salary as a way to boost cash flow. But that's a sign of trouble to Basilo — they're not considering all the contingencies that might come up, in their personal lives as well as with their companies. "That's how they think when they start their business. They're very unprepared," he says. Dan and Darla Robinson aim to have $30,000 in cash in the bank by October, to help run their six sweetFrog franchise yogurt shops when sales slow during colder weather. Dan Robinson estimates cash flow falls about 30 percent during the slow months. The Robinsons, whose stores are in California and Maryland, have increased cash flow by cutting expenses, offering fewer toppings and paying off most of their debt. They have a smaller staff during the stores' down time, and when they need new equipment, they rely on their franchisor's ability to negotiate better prices.

(LUCAS JACKSON/REUTERS) The close: Financials lead TSX’s broad gains to end choppy week Add to ... Reuters Published Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 4:14PM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 4:17PM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Canada’s main stock index ended higher on Friday, to finish a tumultuous week almost unchanged, as higher bond yields and solid U.S. bank earnings helped boost the index’s heavyweight financials sector. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index unofficially closed up 79.12 points, or 0.51 per cent, at 15,497.28. Eight of its main sectors rose. Some of the most influential movers on the index were banks, with Royal Bank of Canada climbing 0.8 per cent and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce up 0.3 per cent. Gains for Canadian bank stocks came as some major U.S. banks reported quarterly profits that beat expectations and bond yields rose after data showed U.S. retail sales rose solidly in December. Higher bond yields increase net interest margins of banks and reduce the value of insurance companies’ liabilities. Manulife Financial Corprose rose 0.4 per cent to $24.81, while the overall financials group gained 0.5 per cent. The S&P 500 rose on Friday after major U.S. banks kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season with strong results, making investors more confident about heady valuations after a recent market rally, while the Nasdaq closed at a record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 5.34 points, or 0.03 per cent, to 19,885.66, the S&P 500 gained 4.2 points, or 0.18 per cent, to 2,274.64 and the Nasdaq Composite added 26.63 points, or 0.48 per cent, to 5,574.12. Wall Street has surged since President-elect Trump’s unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at valuations well above historic averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America , JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts’ expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Mr. Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 per cent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo was 1.5 per cent higher and JPMorgan added 0.5 per cent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 per cent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500’s 6.1-per-cent rise. “Earnings are key going forward, and we’re off to a decent start,” said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow declined, with McDonald’s and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light ahead of a three-day weekend. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 per cent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We’ve come a long way very quickly so there’s scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive,” said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Oil prices fell on Friday and ended the week 3 per cent lower on lingering doubts over the extent of OPEC cuts, with sentiment worsened by concerns over the economic health of the world’s second-largest oil consumer, China, after it reported the steepest falls in overall exports since 2009. Record Chinese crude imports of 8.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in December helped to buoy prices somewhat, traders said, but they could not hide underlying fears over the overall health of the world’s second-biggest economy. Brent crude futures settled 56 cents lower at $55.45 a barrel, ending the week with a loss of about 3 per cent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell by 64 cents to close at $52.37 also notching a weekly drop of nearly 3 per cent. “China right now seems more interested in keeping capital in the country than focusing on growth overall,” Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago said. “We have to watch this situation develop because this is one threat to what is an otherwise wildly bullish scenario for oil in the coming year.” On the supply side, there was some market support from top crude exporter Saudi Arabia, which said that its output had fallen below 10 million bpd to levels last seen in February 2015 and that it expects to make even deeper cuts next month. However, hard evidence of export reductions has yet to emerge, two weeks into the month in which the cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers, such as Russia, were supposed to start. “Compliance won’t be 100 percent; it never is,” an OPEC source told Reuters, adding that an overall rate of 50 percent to 60 percent would be good enough, based on past compliance levels. Although, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo told Reuters he was sure countries would follow through on the deal. Libya’s oil production increased to 750,000 barrels per day (bpd), the deputy leader of the U.N.-backed government said, a rise of about 50,000 bpd from last week. “I think the bigger issues for oil are less about demand right now and a lot more about the supply condition,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. “EIA data and our own government policies have to leave you thinking that a U.S. production response may unwind all the production cuts Saudi Arabia and others are planning.” Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed crude production rose notably last week, particularly in the lower 48 states. Overall production was 8.95 million bpd last week, the most since April of last year. Saudi Arabia is likely to cut heavy oil production rather than light in order to maximize revenues, and as U.S. supply comes back, more light barrels will likely enter the market, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note.

Rosenberg, The Associated Press 4:04 p.m. ET Jan. 13, 2017 Weberous Web Design CEO Rafael Romis poses for photos in his home, in Los Angeles. When Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid. (Photo: Jae C. Hong, AP) NEW YORK — When Rafael Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company's income taxes had to be paid. "Even if you have a good amount in the bank, it's not really your money till you pay your taxes," says Romis, owner of Weberous Web Design. "At the end of the year, it disappeared and we started the new year completely strapped." Romis, whose company is located in Los Angeles, had to use personal savings to restore Weberous' cash reserves. "Cash is king" is an axiom business owners try to live by. If revenue isn't coming in, and owners can't get loans or investors, there's no way to run day-to-day operations, buy inventory and equipment or hire workers. But many companies struggle to maintain a healthy cash flow and create a buffer for an event like a storm that keeps customers home. Companies with cash problems often have overestimated how much revenue they'd have and underestimated expenses, says George Solomon, a George Washington University management professor. It's especially a problem for new owners. These owners may also not be adequately prepared for the seasonality of their business, or for the slow payment practices of their customers — particularly if the customer is a government. "They can literally have millions of dollars on their book in terms of procurement (contracts) for the federal government and literally be filing for bankruptcy," Solomon says. USA TODAY Abrams: 7 steps to small-business success in 2017 Businesses like restaurants with low profit margins are particularly at risk of running through their cash buffers, since any interruption to their revenue can put them in danger of closing. Massachusetts restaurants and retailers had a 50% drop in revenue between Jan. 26 and Feb. 22, 2015, as massive snowstorms hit the state, according to Boston University researchers. Hidden Boston, a website that tracks restaurant openings and closings, counted 20 restaurants that shut down in the metropolitan area in March 2015, compared to 11 a year earlier and five in March 2013. When JPMorgan Chase & Co. studied 597,000 of its small business customers last year, it found their cash flow was lower than expected. Half the businesses had cash reserves that would last just 27 days. Restaurants had the smallest buffer, 16 days, while repair and maintenance businesses had 18 and retailers had 19. Personal service providers like hairdressers and dry cleaners had 21. The biggest buffer, 47 days, was held by real estate companies. The median small company had an average daily cash balance of $12,100, and personal service providers averaged just $5,300. "The typical small business has a low margin of error in the face of economic headwinds and shocks," JPMorgan Chase said. Romis says his cash flow has improved as the company has grown, and he now aims to have a two-month cash buffer. If business slows, he's willing to take on smaller projects — ones that will bring in $8,500 compared to $10,000 for his company's more typical jobs — to keep cash coming in. He considered using credit cards, but when he took at $7,500 cash advance on a card with a $15,000 credit line, the bank immediately reduced his limit to $7,500, eliminating that alternative. Tate Tullis has learned to bank money during his road sign company's busy months to give Sign Wise a buffer equal to 20% of its annual revenue. The 3-year-old business gets most of its sales during warmer weather, since during the winter fewer roads and parking lots are being built or overhauled. USA TODAY Abrams: Entrepreneurs! On your marks, get set ... shred When business drops off, the Logan, Utah, company looks at its inventory and raw materials like aluminum, assesses how much it really needs, and sells the surplus. It also does more marketing to overseas customers. All these steps leave Tullis feeling comfortable with his company's cash position. "If everything went south, we'd probably have enough cash for two or three months," he says. The recession taught many business owners some lessons about cash flow, says Thomas Basilo, a certified public accountant with Withum Smith & Brown in Morristown, New Jersey. They've given themselves more wiggle room negotiating flexible payment terms with vendors, sometimes as long as 90 days after an invoice is sent. They've also gotten better terms from lenders. Weberous Web Design CEO Rafael Romis poses for photos in his home, in Los Angeles. When Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid.  (Photo: Jae C. Hong, AP) Many startup owners forgo a salary as a way to boost cash flow. But that's a sign of trouble to Basilo — they're not considering all the contingencies that might come up, in their personal lives as well as with their companies. "That's how they think when they start their business. They're very unprepared," he says. Dan and Darla Robinson aim to have $30,000 in cash in the bank by October, to help run their six sweetFrog franchise yogurt shops when sales slow during colder weather. Dan Robinson estimates cash flow falls about 30 percent during the slow months. The Robinsons, whose stores are in California and Maryland, have increased cash flow by cutting expenses, offering fewer toppings and paying off most of their debt. They have a smaller staff during the stores' down time, and when they need new equipment, they rely on their franchisor's ability to negotiate better prices. USA TODAY 6 key resolutions for your small business While they do have savings, they don't want to tap them for cash flow. "We pretend that the savings doesn't exist," Dan Robinson says.

Wall Street has surged since President-elect Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at valuations well above historic averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America <BAC.N>, JPMorgan <JPM.N> and Wells Fargo <WFC.N> all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo was 1.04-percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.43 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500's 6.1 percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow declined, with McDonald's <MCD.N> and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light ahead of a three-day weekend. At 2:42 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was down 0.14 percent at 19,863.26 points, while the S&P 500 <.SPX> had gained 0.10 percent to 2,272.67. The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 0.39 percent to 5,569.18. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq was from Facebook <FB.O>, which jumped 1.6 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.49-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.06-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 30 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 113 new highs and 10 new lows.

DiStefano, Staff Writer Twitter icon @PhillyJoeD Close icon Mail icon Email Twitter icon @PhillyJoeD     Joseph N. DiStefano Staff Writer Joseph N. DiStefano writes about Philadelphia-area enterprise, and the people and money that make it go.  More by Joseph N. DiStefano Trump and the economy: How fast is enough? Jan 11 Fed chief advises youth to follow the Ben Franklin model Jan 13 Card deals: Amazon wants buyers to borrow Jan 13 More from Joseph N. DiStefano Arrow icon Amazon's giveaway deal with JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s giant credit card operation -- which is largely based in Delaware -- sounds so generous, you wonder how the partners are making any money. "We’ve expanded benefits on the existing Amazon Rewards Card, and launched a new Amazon Prime Rewards Card that provides 5% back on Amazon.com purchases" for Amazon Prime members, who will be "automatically upgraded," Chase spokeswoman Maria Martinez told me.  Chase has also cut foreign exchange fees, encouraging foreign buyers. Amazon invited banks to bid for the new program in mid-November, an industry source told me. Chase already offered an Amazon card and was able to launch the new program fast. Amazon's reported profits from credit cards are still small, but growing quickly. In its most recent quarterly report, Amazon said it earned $372 million in North American profits from "other income," including credit cards and certain unnamed advertising services, during the fall quarter, up from $249 million a year earlier. That 53% one-year increase is double Amazon's overall sales growth rate (27%).  If Amazon keeps up that pace, it's possible credit card income will in the next few years begin contributing significantly to its profits, which totalled $1 billion a month in 2016 for the first time. How long will Amazon grow rich from consumers' borrowed money? Old-fashioned retailers have a long, and not always happy, history with credit cards. Sears, Montgomery Ward, JCPenney, Federated/Macy's, and most recently Cabela's boosted sales for years by adding both branded cards through their own banks and "cobranded" deals with partners like Chase.   Those arrangements, particularly the store-owned cards, followed a familar cycle: First, shoppers flocked to open card accounts, drawn by bonuses like Amazon's discounts. The new cardholders spent more, boosting sales reports. They ran up card debts, juicing company profits as consumers posted monthly interest payments. And then, as the loans "matured" over a few years, the issuers booked rising losses, sometimes leading to the sale of the portfolio and a writedown or fall in profits. Cabela's sold its card bank to Capital One Inc. as the chain faced bankruptcy reorganization and was sold to Bass Pro Shops last year. Has Amazon and its partners learned from others' credit adventures? "From Amazon's point of view, they can't lose," insists Bill Keenan, chairman and CEO of Wilmington-based credit card advertising agency and consulting group DeNovo Corp.  Amazon issues cards through two different bank partners -- GE's former Synchrony unit, and Chase. "They don't own the infrastructure, they don't own the assets, they aren't burdened by the bank regulators," Keenan said. How can Chase and Amazon share profits after a 5 percent upfront discount? "Chase is looking for low cost of account acquisition, which can significantly compensate" for finance costs, Keenan told me. "The Amazon card is a reminder in your pocket." Like a portable ad, offering an instant discount. "You can bet Chase is funding a good portion of that incentive," Keenan added. Martinez said Chase won't comment on how large Amazon's program has grown. Keenan says Chase and Amazon have plenty of customer spending and targeting data to help maximize sales -- especially to customers who can be counted on to run up a tab and make lucrative double-digit interest payments every month -- while minimizing losses to fraud and people unable to pay. "The big challenge is the customer who doesn't revolve (borrow)," consumers who can afford to pay off what they owe every month, and are disciplined enough to do so, Keenan added. Amazon has shown before it's willing to wait, deferring profits if it can boost market share in the meantime.

Wall Street has surged since President-elect Trump's unexpected election victory on optimism he will cut corporate taxes, spend on infrastructure and deregulate banks. With stocks trading at valuations well above historic averages, many investors believe further gains will depend on S&P 500 companies handing in strong report cards over the next several weeks. Major banks on Friday did not disappoint: Bank of America , JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all posted quarterly profits above analysts' expectations. They also expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the election in November. Their shares surged over 2 percent but later gave up most of those gains. Wells Fargo was 1.04-percent higher and JPMorgan added 0.43 percent. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500's 6.1 percent rise. "Earnings are key going forward, and we're off to a decent start," said Mike Baele, managing director with the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank in Portland, Oregon. The Dow declined, with McDonald's and other consumer stocks down after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light ahead of a three-day weekend. At 2:42 pm ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.14 percent at 19,863.26 points, while the S&P 500 had gained 0.10 percent to 2,272.67. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.39 percent to 5,569.18. The biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq was from Facebook, which jumped 1.6 percent after Raymond James upgraded the stock. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is expected to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.49-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.06-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 30 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 113 new highs and 10 new lows.

He's not the only one who should feel that way. The nagging question on the tip of every investor's tongue is whether or not the Trump stock market rally had gone too far, too fast. The market has been flat since mid- December. But after seeing the earnings reports from our nation's biggest banks on Friday, the answer is no. And the feeling of relief to those who follow financial markets closely is difficult to overstate. "Ask any market veteran if they think it is a positive when banks lead rallies, they'll say yes, in unison." Why? Bank stocks have led the rally since last November's presidential election, going from unloved by investors to becoming anchor positions in many a portfolio. After years of suffering the indignity of massive fines, increased regulatory oversight and receiving the blame for the Great Recession, bank stocks have replaced consumer staples and utilities as the must-own stocks. Ask any market veteran if they think it is a positive when banks lead rallies, they'll say yes, in unison. Simply put, when banks lead a stock market rally, it is an indicator that loan demand is rising, that business is percolating and that the economy is on firmer footing. It's also the go-to investment choice if one believes interest rates are heading higher. Banks make more money on their net interest margin, meaning they make more money on their massive customer deposits. show chapters Wall Street reacts to busy day of bank earnings    Friday, 13 Jan 2017 | 9:00 AM ET | 04:03 But today was the moment of truth for the Trump rally because JPMorgan, Bank of America and scandal-plagued Wells Fargo reported quarterly earnings for the first time since the election. Investors were worried these banks wouldn't be able to live up to their elevated expectations. JPMorgan takes the title as the best beat on both earnings and revenues and otherwise, a squeaky clean quarter from the nation's biggest bank. Bank of America beat the bottom line, with a small miss on the top line and an optimistic forecast going forward. Wells Fargo had a tough quarter, but based on how the stock is performing today, investors are obviously pleased that it didn't do worse in spite of its recent scandal. JPMorgan and Bank of America touched new 52-week highs on Friday. Additionally, the quarterly reports from the aforementioned banks corroborate other glowing news on the economy. Consumer sentiment, holiday sales, wage growth and automobile sales have been either elevated or improving as of late. Yet interest rates and inflation remain historically low. This is about as Goldilocks for investors as it gets. No one could, or should, rule out future stock market volatility, which has always been a normal occurrence. But if you view banks as the economy's canary in the coalmine, as I do, then you've got some pretty darn healthy canaries. Stop doubting the rally. It's the real deal. — By Mitch Goldberg, president of ClientFirst Strategy Read more from Mitch Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change JPM --- To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

REUTERS/Larry Downing/File Photo    5421439 CEO of JP Morgan Chase Jamie Dimon said Friday that he thinks President-elect Donald Trump will do the right thing for the United States. After discussing the bank’s fourth quarter earnings, Dimon told reporters that he is comforted by the fact that Trump is appointing experienced people to his cabinet. Dimon joined Trump’s economic advisory team in December, 2016. “I am a patriot — I want to help my country and help it grow,” Dimon said after Trump made the announcement. The move by Trump to bring on Dimon raised more than a few eyebrows, given his statements about Dimon in 2013. “I’m not Jamie Dimon, who pays $13 billion to settle a case and then pays $11 billion to settle a case and who I think is the worst banker in the United States,” Trump told reporters. Stocks in the banking and financial sectors have skyrocketed in recent weeks, as banks and investors believe the president-elect will usher in a new era of deregulation and lower taxes. Banks earning reports gave a significant boost to the S&P 500 and NASDAQ indexes Friday. (RELATED: A Comprehensive Look At Donald Trump’s Tax Plan) After defeating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Trump tapped former Goldman Sachs executive Steve Mnuchin for Treasury secretary. Mnuchin has since made public statements expressing his distaste for the 2,300 page Dodd-Frank Act, a view that has many investors elated. The former Goldman banker also wants to privatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two of the largest names in the U.S. mortgage market. (RELATED: Mnuchin Wants To Privatize Fannie Mae And Freddie Mac) JP Morgan’s quarterly earnings report was well past what analysts expected, showing quarterly revenue of over $24 billion. “Our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year, reflecting our intense client focus and solid performance across our businesses,” Dimon said in a Friday press release.

REUTERS/Stephanie Keith By David Henry and Dan Freed | NEW YORK NEW YORK Executives of big U.S. banks expressed optimism on Friday about the outlook for 2017 in their first public comments about quarterly earnings since the U.S. presidential election in November. JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), the two largest U.S. banks, kicked off the corporate reporting season on a rosy note, each with healthy increases in fourth-quarter profit. Those improvements came on the back of trading revenue gains, higher interest rates, healthy loan growth and cost controls. On the flip side, the earnings of Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), which also reported on Friday, were hurt by the fallout of a sales scandal and a loss related to accounting, both of which are particular to the San Francisco-based lender. Results at regional lender PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) were better than expected, with Chief Financial Officer Rob Reilly predicting the bank will be able to increase revenue faster than expenses this year. Shares of all four banks climbed Friday afternoon, with JPMorgan up 0.5 percent at $86.64, Bank of America up 0.4 percent at $23.01, Wells Fargo up 1.1 percent at $55.15 and PNC up 0.4 percent at $118.39. On conference calls with reporters and analysts, top executives were sanguine about topics ranging from interest rates and loan growth, to regulation and the incoming administration of President-Elect Donald Trump. OPTIMISTIC "We are very optimistic about the future, optimistic about new policies which could spur growth," Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said. The bank's finance chief, Paul Donofrio, predicted BofA will be able to produce an additional $600 million in the current quarter from higher interest rates, with further gains throughout the year. He also cited customers' "high credit quality" and positive trends in auto, home and middle-market loans, as being supportive of earnings. In the fourth quarter, BofA benefited from an aggressive cost-cutting programme Moynihan detailed last summer, as well as a pickup in trading revenue. JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon was slightly more circumspect, but said he was comforted by the fact that Trump was selecting people with experience to join his team. Dimon also cited several positive economic trends that suggest the global economy is headed in the right direction, which will help buoy bank earnings. "The economy is getting a little bit better," he said. "Interest rates help and looking forward, you probably have a better political, legal and regulatory environment." The bank is sticking by its loan growth forecast of 10 to 15 percent for 2017, though Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said it might be towards the lower end of the range. 'SOLID PERFORMANCE' Despite Wells Fargo's unique troubles, its chief financial officer, John Shrewsberry, also said the bank had a "solid underlying performance," citing loan growth, good credit quality and higher interest rates. The idea that banks will benefit from lighter regulation, rising interest rates and lower taxes under Trump has driven bank stocks up nearly 25 percent since the election. Nearly all the executives commented on the enthusiasm evident in markets, but were hesitant to fully endorse it. For instance, Dimon noted that it may take a full year for the new government in Washington to decide exactly how it will tackle complex issues like corporate tax reform. And, he said, increased competition means lenders may just "compete away" any tax benefits they receive. "We've all heard that the new administration in Washington supports tax reform, regulatory relief and other pro-growth policies," said PNC Chief Executive Bill Demchak. "But, so far, a move in interest rates is the only thing that has actually happened." Other big banks, including Citigroup Inc (C.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), will report results next week.

Read also: Stock market buoyed by better-than-expected bank earnings The bank’s business tied to helping its clients buy and sell stocks, bonds and other securities, saw a 24% rise in revenue to $4.5 billion from $3.6 billion a year ago, with fixed-income specifically enjoying a more than 30% pop in revenue compared with the same period a year earlier. Those results helped the U.S.’s biggest bank by assets ring up a record annual profit of $24.73 billion, beating the previous record of $24.44 billion set in 2015.

The sector has seen stocks, if not profits, languish since the 2008-09 crisis rocked global markets and led to a raft of stringent policy measures to rein in bad actors across the world. But Friday’s results appeared to signal that shift may be at hand in some of the most profitable areas. “The fixed-income market is going to go up, and needs for [currencies] is going up, and the needs for hedging is going up” Dimon said, during a Friday conference call with investors.

REUTERS/Andrew Kelly Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: Executives of big U.S. banks expressed optimism on Friday about the outlook for 2017 in their first public comments about quarterly earnings since the U.S. presidential election in November. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America Corp, the two largest U.S. banks, kicked off the corporate reporting season on a rosy note, each with healthy increases in fourth-quarter profit. Those improvements came on the back of trading revenue gains, higher interest rates, healthy loan growth and cost controls. On the flip side, the earnings of Wells Fargo & Co, which also reported on Friday, were hurt by the fallout of a sales scandal and a loss related to accounting, both of which are particular to the San Francisco-based lender. Results at regional lender PNC Financial Services Group Inc were better than expected, with Chief Financial Officer Rob Reilly predicting the bank will be able to increase revenue faster than expenses this year. Shares of all four banks climbed Friday afternoon, with JPMorgan up 0.5 percent at US$86.64, Bank of America up 0.4 percent at US$23.01, Wells Fargo up 1.1 percent at US$55.15 and PNC up 0.4 percent at US$118.39. On conference calls with reporters and analysts, top executives were sanguine about topics ranging from interest rates and loan growth, to regulation and the incoming administration of President-Elect Donald Trump. OPTIMISTIC "We are very optimistic about the future, optimistic about new policies which could spur growth," Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said. The bank's finance chief, Paul Donofrio, predicted BofA will be able to produce an additional US$600 million in the current quarter from higher interest rates, with further gains throughout the year. He also cited customers' "high credit quality" and positive trends in auto, home and middle-market loans, as being supportive of earnings. In the fourth quarter, BofA benefited from an aggressive cost-cutting program Moynihan detailed last summer, as well as a pickup in trading revenue. JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon was slightly more circumspect, but said he was comforted by the fact that Trump was selecting people with experience to join his team. Dimon also cited several positive economic trends that suggest the global economy is headed in the right direction, which will help buoy bank earnings. "The economy is getting a little bit better," he said. "Interest rates help and looking forward, you probably have a better political, legal and regulatory environment." The bank is sticking by its loan growth forecast of 10 to 15 percent for 2017, though Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said it might be toward the lower end of the range. 'SOLID PERFORMANCE' Despite Wells Fargo's unique troubles, its chief financial officer, John Shrewsberry, also said the bank had a "solid underlying performance," citing loan growth, good credit quality and higher interest rates. The idea that banks will benefit from lighter regulation, rising interest rates and lower taxes under Trump has driven bank stocks up nearly 25 percent since the election. Nearly all the executives commented on the enthusiasm evident in markets, but were hesitant to fully endorse it. For instance, Dimon noted that it may take a full year for the new government in Washington to decide exactly how it will tackle complex issues like corporate tax reform. And, he said, increased competition means lenders may just "compete away" any tax benefits they receive. "We've all heard that the new administration in Washington supports tax reform, regulatory relief and other pro-growth policies," said PNC Chief Executive Bill Demchak. "But, so far, a move in interest rates is the only thing that has actually happened." Other big banks, including Citigroup Inc, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, will report results next week.

The Dow was little changed, held back by a drop in consumer stocks after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light ahead of a three-day weekend. Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all reported quarterly profits that beat analysts' expectations and expressed optimism about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since the U.S. presidential election. Bank of America jumped as much as 2.1 percent to $23.41, their highest since the financial crisis. JPMorgan surged 2.2 percent at a record high of $88.17 and Wells Fargo gained 3.1 percent to $56.20. Goldman Sachs hit a more than nine-year high, while Morgan Stanley touched a more than eight-year high. Five of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the financial index's 0.45 percent rise leading the advancers. The KBW Bank index was up 0.60 percent. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is estimated to have risen 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, largely helped by financial companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "Financials have had a very good run post election and the data we've gotten today from the big banks has been very good and we do expect this sector to post strong earnings mostly due to the rising interest rate environment," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. At 12:42 p.m. ET (1742 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 9.15 points, or 0.05 percent, at 19,881.85. The S&P 500 was up 4.55 points, or 0.20 percent, at 2,274.99 The Nasdaq Composite was up 29.85 points, or 0.54 percent, at 5,577.34. It had hit a record high earlier in the day. The biggest boost was from Facebook, which jumped 1.6 percent to $128.65 after Raymond James upgraded the stock. U.S. stocks overall have been on the rise since the election on optimism that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's policies will benefit the economy. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500's 6.1 percent rise. But, analysts fear the market has run too far too soon, with Trump's policies expected to hit legislature hurdles, and with stock valuations stretched. "There is a lot of optimism baked in 2017 as far as earnings go and we've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Adams. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,780 to 1,039. On the Nasdaq, 2,017 issues rose and 784 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 29 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 109 new highs and seven new lows.

Joyce M. Rosenberg, AP Business Writer Leave a comment 3 reads In this Tuesday, Jan. 10, 2017, photo, Weberous Web Design CEO Rafael Romis poses for photos in his home, in Los Angeles. When Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid. (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) NEW YORK (AP) — When Rafael Romis started his website design company five years ago, he kept enough cash on hand to last about two weeks. That worked well until the company’s income taxes had to be paid. “Even if you have a good amount in the bank, it’s not really your money till you pay your taxes,” says Romis, owner of Weberous Web Design. “At the end of the year, it disappeared and we started the new year completely strapped.” Romis, whose company is located in Los Angeles, had to use personal savings to restore Weberous’ cash reserves. “Cash is king” is an axiom business owners try to live by. If revenue isn’t coming in, and owners can’t get loans or investors, there’s no way to run day-to-day operations, buy inventory and equipment or hire workers. But many companies struggle to maintain a healthy cash flow and create a buffer for an event like a storm that keeps customers home. Companies with cash problems often have overestimated how much revenue they’d have and underestimated expenses, says George Solomon, a George Washington University management professor. It’s especially a problem for new owners. These owners may also not be adequately prepared for the seasonality of their business, or for the slow payment practices of their customers — particularly if the customer is a government. “They can literally have millions of dollars on their book in terms of procurement (contracts) for the federal government and literally be filing for bankruptcy,” Solomon says. Businesses like restaurants with low profit margins are particularly at risk of running through their cash buffers, since any interruption to their revenue can put them in danger of closing. Massachusetts restaurants and retailers had a 50 percent drop in revenue between Jan. 26 and Feb. 22, 2015, as massive snowstorms hit the state, according to Boston University researchers. Hidden Boston, a website that tracks restaurant openings and closings, counted 20 restaurants that shut down in the metropolitan area in March 2015, compared to 11 a year earlier and five in March 2013. When JPMorgan Chase & Co. studied 597,000 of its small business customers last year, it found their cash flow was lower than expected. Half the businesses had cash reserves that would last just 27 days. Restaurants had the smallest buffer, 16 days, while repair and maintenance businesses had 18 and retailers had 19. Personal service providers like hairdressers and dry cleaners had 21. The biggest buffer, 47 days, was held by real estate companies. The median small company had an average daily cash balance of $12,100, and personal service providers averaged just $5,300. “The typical small business has a low margin of error in the face of economic headwinds and shocks,” JPMorgan Chase said. Romis says his cash flow has improved as the company has grown, and he now aims to have a two-month cash buffer. If business slows, he’s willing to take on smaller projects — ones that will bring in $8,500 compared to $10,000 for his company’s more typical jobs — to keep cash coming in. He considered using credit cards, but when he took at $7,500 cash advance on a card with a $15,000 credit line, the bank immediately reduced his limit to $7,500, eliminating that alternative. Tate Tullis has learned to bank money during his road sign company’s busy months to give Sign Wise a buffer equal to 20 percent of its annual revenue. The 3-year-old business gets most of its sales during warmer weather, since during the winter fewer roads and parking lots are being built or overhauled. When business drops off, the Logan, Utah, company looks at its inventory and raw materials like aluminum, assesses how much it really needs, and sells the surplus. It also does more marketing to overseas customers. All these steps leave Tullis feeling comfortable with his company’s cash position. “If everything went south, we’d probably have enough cash for two or three months,” he says. The recession taught many business owners some lessons about cash flow, says Thomas Basilo, a certified public accountant with Withum Smith & Brown in Morristown, New Jersey. They’ve given themselves more wiggle room negotiating flexible payment terms with vendors, sometimes as long as 90 days after an invoice is sent. They’ve also gotten better terms from lenders. Many startup owners forgo a salary as a way to boost cash flow. But that’s a sign of trouble to Basilo — they’re not considering all the contingencies that might come up, in their personal lives as well as with their companies. “That’s how they think when they start their business. They’re very unprepared,” he says. Dan and Darla Robinson aim to have $30,000 in cash in the bank by October, to help run their six sweetFrog franchise yogurt shops when sales slow during colder weather. Dan Robinson estimates cash flow falls about 30 percent during the slow months. The Robinsons, whose stores are in California and Maryland, have increased cash flow by cutting expenses, offering fewer toppings and paying off most of their debt. They have a smaller staff during the stores’ down time, and when they need new equipment, they rely on their franchisor’s ability to negotiate better prices. While they do have savings, they don’t want to tap them for cash flow. “We pretend that the savings doesn’t exist,” Dan Robinson says. _____ Follow Joyce Rosenberg at www.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said on Friday he thinks President-elect Donald Trump's administration will do the right thing for the U.S. He just needs time, Dimon said, according to Reuters. Dimon, speaking with reporters following the bank's fourth-quarter earnings release, said he is comforted that Trump is appointing experienced people to his administration, Reuters reported. Bank stocks have rallied on expectations that the president-elect will eliminate financial regulations put in place after the 2008 financial crisis. Following Trump's election victory, the president-elect tapped former Goldman Sachs partner Steven Mnuchin for Treasury secretary. Mnuchin said the Dodd-Frank banking regulations are too complicated and a headwind to lending. Trump once called Dimon "the worst banker in the United States." Trump criticized Dimon in 2013 for reaching a $13 billion settlement with the U.S. government over the sale of toxic mortgages instead of fighting the case. show chapters JPM posts earnings beat of $1.71 vs. $1.44 est.    Friday, 13 Jan 2017 | 8:06 AM ET | 01:49 On Friday, JPMorgan's quarterly earnings pushed well past analysts' expectations, helped by double-digit growth in deposits and record credit card sales.

Photos of the weekend SUBSCRIBE An Amazon.com package awaits delivery from UPS in Palo Alto, Ca. in October 2010. The online retailer giant has released a new credit card for its Prime members. Paul Sakuma/AP Photo/File | Caption Mengqi Sun Staff January 13, 2017 —The online retail giant Amazon is rolling out another product to lure its loyal customers. This time, it’s a credit card with appealing terms. The search company collaborated with JP Morgan Chase for the new Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card, announced on Wednesday. The new card rewards its cardmembers as much as five percent on any purchase from the website, according to a press release from the company – while, for Amazon and Chase, it represents one more way to capitalize on the website's massive customer base. The idea of the card, which targets Amazon Prime members, is not brand new. It is built upon the existing Amazon Rewards Visa Signature card, which currently offers a three-percent reward. Cardholders who are also Prime members will be automatically upgraded, according to Amazon.   “What's new is accelerating and improving the rewards process to make it a more enticing proposition to cardholders,” David Robertson, publisher of the Nilson Report, a trade publication on credit card industry, tells The Christian Science Monitor. “And that's really where the game is these days and for the last two years or more…And there's a real battle to try to become first or top in wallet.” In addition to five percent back on all purchases from Amazon’s website, the card offers a two-percent cash reward at restaurants, gas stations, and drugstores, and one percent everywhere else. It does not charge an annual fee or a foreign transaction fee; to be eligible, however, customers must pay $99 per year to join the company’s Prime membership.  The most expensive items on Amazon “We are adding even more value to Prime by offering rewards on Amazon and everywhere else you shop,” Max Bardon, a vice president at Amazon, said in a statement.  Zack Friedman, founder of Make Lemonade, a finance platform that offers financial advice, said this card is Amazon’s strategy to increase its Prime membership. “Clearly, Amazon wants to increase its Prime membership base, which has been a major profitability and growth engine for Amazon …and an effective strategy to retain its customer base,” he wrote in a piece on Forbes. Created in 2005 as a way to offer free two-day shipping, an Amazon Prime membership now includes streaming music, TV shows, and movies, among other benefits.  “It’s interesting for Amazon in that they keep layering on more and more things to make that Prime membership more and more attractive,” Matt Schulz, a senior industry analyst at Creditcards.com, tells the Monitor. “It’s interesting to see how they’ve expanded that to grow the loyalty.”  Mr. Robertson says offering credit is also Amazon’s way to generate additional profits from its existing customer base. “At some point, you get to the top end of what your potential customer base is, and then what you have to do is to mine your existing customer base for additional profits, and that's where revolving credit cards come in,” he says. According to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, nearly half of households had a Prime membership in early 2016, reaching 54 million – a customer base that represents potential for Chase, as well.  “Hundreds of millions of people shop at Amazon.com and there is no better way to earn rewards for their purchases than Chase’s new Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Signature Card,” Kevin Watters, the chief executive of Chase card services, said in a statement. “We are thrilled to be working with Amazon to offer even more value to our cardmembers.” Analysts say this newly designed metal card could be Chase’s way to replicate the early success of its popular Sapphire Reserve card. “This is another example of Chase going all out to attract high-end credit card customers,” Mr. Schulz says. “Even though the Amazon Prime customer isn’t a monolithic thing, and there's an awful lot of people in that group, it would stand to reason that the average Amazon Prime member is probably a little more upscale than the typical Amazon customers.” Some observers warn against the potential impact Amazon’s new credit card might have on brick-and-mortar businesses.  Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox. Sign-Up × “The Amazon Prime Rewards Signature Visa Card is a potential disruptor that can change the retail landscape,” Mr. Friedman tells the Monitor in an email. "By expanding its credit card benefits, Amazon’s strategy is for consumers to make Amazon their default retailer for virtually all their shopping needs." Yet, while Amazon might attempt to grab more market share through this card, Robertson says, “this will not set the world on fire. This is an add-on.” Print/Reprints Next Up The most expensive items on Amazon By Eoin O'Carroll Staff The New Economy As legacy retailers make deep cuts, Amazon promises 100,000 jobs by mid-2018 By Lonnie Shekhtman The New Economy Despite hard times for Macy’s and Sears, physical retail stores are booming By Lonnie Shekhtman Photos of the Day Photos of the weekend Our Award-Winning Publication Subscribe to the Monitor's trustworthy weekly review of global news and ideas.

JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender, said earnings rose to $6.7 billion, or $1.71 per share, from $5.4 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding an atypical tax benefit, the bank earned $1.58 per share, well above the average analyst estimate of $1.44 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. JPMorgan has one of the largest global investment banks, which affects its earnings significantly when market activity picks up or declines. Along with other big banks, it was widely expected to benefit from a wave of trading in stocks and bonds following Donald Trump's stunning victory in the presidential election on Nov. 8. Revenue from fixed-income trading - JPMorgan's most volatile business - rose 31 percent to $3.4 billion, while stock trading revenue increased 8 percent to $1.2 billion. Bank of America Corp, which reported results earlier on Friday, also said trading revenue surged last quarter. In a statement discussing results, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon cited those market trends, as well as growth in deposits and loans, higher credit card sales and competitive gains in "virtually all" of JPMorgan's businesses. The bank also kept a tight lid on expenses, he said. JPMorgan's shares were little changed in premarket trading. Like other banks, its stock has seen big gains since the election on expectations that Trump's plans to cut taxes, ease regulations and boost infrastructure spending will help profits. JPMorgan's stock had risen 23 percent from the election through Thursday's close.

JPMorgan profit climbs 24 percent, beating forecasts, on trading surge (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co reported a 24 percent rise in fourth-quarter profits on Friday, beating analyst expectations, as its Wall Street business benefited from a surge in trading activity following the U.S. election. By David Henry and Sweta Singh (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co reported a 24 percent rise in fourth-quarter profits on Friday, beating analyst expectations, as its Wall Street business benefited from a surge in trading activity following the U.S. election. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender, said earnings rose to $6.7 billion, or $1.71 per share, from $5.4 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding an atypical tax benefit, the bank earned $1.58 per share, well above the average analyst estimate of $1.44 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. JPMorgan has one of the largest global investment banks, which affects its earnings significantly when market activity picks up or declines. Along with other big banks, it was widely expected to benefit from a wave of trading in stocks and bonds following Donald Trump's stunning victory in the presidential election on Nov. 8. Revenue from fixed-income trading - JPMorgan's most volatile business - rose 31 percent to $3.4 billion, while stock trading revenue increased 8 percent to $1.2 billion. Bank of America Corp, which reported results earlier on Friday, also said trading revenue surged last quarter. In a statement discussing results, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon cited those market trends, as well as growth in deposits and loans, higher credit card sales and competitive gains in "virtually all" of JPMorgan's businesses. The bank also kept a tight lid on expenses, he said. JPMorgan's shares were little changed in premarket trading. Like other banks, its stock has seen big gains since the election on expectations that Trump's plans to cut taxes, ease regulations and boost infrastructure spending will help profits. JPMorgan's stock had risen 23 percent from the election through Thursday's close.

Reuters Published Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 11:30AM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 11:32AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Canada’s main stock index rose on Friday, led by the country’s heavyweight banks as U.S. fourth-quarter earnings season kicked off and bond yields rose. Some of the most influential movers on the index were banks, with Toronto-Dominion Bank rising 0.5 per cent to $67.46 and Royal Bank of Canada climbing 0.9 per cent to $94.59. Gains for Canadian bank stocks came as some major U.S. banks reported quarterly profits that beat expectations and bond yields rose after data showed U.S. retail sales rose solidly in December. Higher bond yields increase net interest margins of banks and reduce the value of insurance companies’ liabilities. Manulife Financial Corp. rose 1.1 per cent to $24.70, while the overall financials group gained 0.6 per cent. At 11:27 a.m. ET, the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index rose 61.79 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 15,479.95. Still, it is on track to fall 0.1 per cent for the week after reaching last week its highest since September 2014 at 15,621.40, a near all-time high. Consumer staples rose 0.9 per cent, while the materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, rose 0.5 per cent even as some gold miners lost ground as gold prices fell. Barrick Gold Corp. declined 1 per cent to $21.94, while gold futures fell 0.9 per cent to $1,188.1 an ounce. Nine of the index’s 10 main groups were higher, with the energy group little changed as oil fell. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were higher in late morning trading on Friday as strong earnings from large U.S. lenders bode well for the rest of the earnings season. The Dow’s gains were comparatively lesser, held back by a drop in consumer stocks after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light ahead of a three-day weekend. Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all reported quarterly profits that beat analysts expectations. Bank of America jumped as much as 2.1 per cent to $23.41, their highest since the financial crisis. JPMorgan surged 2.2 per cent at a record high of $88.17 and Wells Fargo gained 3.1 per cent to $56.20. Goldman Sachs hit a more than nine-year high, while Morgan Stanley touched a more than eight-year high. Six of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the financial index’s 1.23-per-cent rise leading the advancers. The KBW Bank index was up 1.64 per cent, set for their best day since Dec. 1. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is estimated to have risen 5.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, largely helped by financial companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “Financials have had a very good run post election and the data we’ve gotten today from the big banks has been very good and we do expect this sector to post strong earnings mostly due to the rising interest rate environment,” said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 19.97 points, or 0.1 percent, at 19,910.97. The S&P 500 was up 6.81 points, or 0.29 per cent, at 2,277.25. The Nasdaq Composite was up 31.87 points, or 0.57 per cent, at 5,579.36. It had hit a record high of 5564.25. The biggest boost was from Facebook, which jumped 1.9 per cent to $128.98 after a Raymond James upgraded the stock. U.S. stocks overall have been on the rise since the election on optimism that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s policies will benefit the economy. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 per cent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500’s 6.1 percent rise. But, analysts fear the market has run too far too soon, with Trump’s policies expected to hit legislature hurdles, and with stock valuations stretched. “There is a lot of optimism baked in 2017 as far as earnings go and we’ve come a long way very quickly so there’s scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive,” said Mr. Adams. Oil prices fell on Friday and were on track to end the week lower on lingering doubts over the extent of OPEC cuts, with sentiment worsened by concerns over the economic health of the world’s second-largest oil consumer China after it reported the steepest falls in overall exports since 2009. Record Chinese crude imports of 8.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in December helped to buoy prices somewhat, traders said, but they could not hide underlying fears over the overall health of the world’s second-biggest economy. Despite China’s oil thirst, overall exports - the country’s economic backbone - declined by 7.7 per cent last year in what was the second annual decline in a row and the worst since the depths of the global crisis in 2009. Brent crude futures were trading 31 cents lower at $55.70 a barrel and were on track for a weekly loss of 2.5 per cent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell by 41 cents to $52.60, set for a weekly drop of 2.6 per cent. Exports of Chinese refined oil products last month rose nearly 25 per cent year-on-year to a record 5.4 million tonnes, well above November’s previous record of 4.9 million tonnes. “China right now seems more interested in keeping capital in the country than focusing on growth overall,” Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago said. “We have to watch this situation develop because this is one threat to what is an otherwise wildly bullish scenario for oil in the coming year.” On the supply side, there was some market support from top crude exporter Saudi Arabia, which said that its output had fallen below 10 million bpd to levels last seen in February 2015 and that it expects to make even deeper cuts next month. However, hard evidence of export reductions has yet to emerge, two weeks into the month in which the cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers, such as Russia, were supposed to start. Many analysts expect compliance of 50 per cent to 80 per cent at best. “As the Saudis hint at even deeper reductions in February, assumptions are rife that its enthusiastic approach to output cuts is an admission that cheating is expected on the part of other producers,” said Stephen Brennock of oil brokerage PVM. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its January outlook that it expects Brent and WTI to average $53 and $52 a barrel respectively in 2017. Even if OPEC cuts its output as agreed, traders said that rising U.S. shale output and increasing supply from OPEC members Nigeria and Libya, which were exempt from the pact, might offset any reductions. The market also awaited U.S. drilling rig count data from energy services firm Baker Hughes Inc at 1 p.m. EST (1800 GMT), the indicator future U.S. production.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 13, 2017 11:13am   Comments Share: Investors got hit with a truckload of earnings and economic data Friday morning, and may spend much of today deciding what it all means. Big bank earnings, retail sales, inflation: You name it; we have it to discuss. In a nutshell, strong earnings from Bank of America Corp(NYSE: BAC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) reinforce what we’ve been talking about. We expected trading to be better due to the post-election rally, and that’s reflected in the numbers from these two big companies. Wells Fargo & Co(NYSE: WFC), which relies less on trading than BAC and JPM, didn’t perform as well. And retail sales, which rose 0.6% in December, look like a bit of a disappointment, especially considering recent increases in consumer sentiment. Wall Street analysts had been expecting a 0.7% rise. Automobile sales led the way, but that was something we knew going in. It looks like holiday shopping perhaps was a little disappointing. The markets are holding steady in the early going, and any rally could be on hold until we hear from more companies. There may be more emphasis on what the banks say on their earnings calls, as we wait to hear CEOs’ economic outlooks for 2017. Let’s look at the earnings numbers. At BAC, earnings jumped to 40 cents a share from 27 cents a year earlier, above the Wall Street consensus of 38 cents a share. However, adjusted revenue of $20.22 billion was below the consensus estimate of $20.85 billion. Trading revenue rose 11% to $2.91 billion, with fixed income leading the way. Additionally, BAC committed to re-purchasing additional shares, and cited “strong client activity” in Q4, a sign that the post-election rally may have delivered a trading volume bump. JPM beat consensus estimates for both earnings and revenue. The company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.71 per share on revenue of $24.333 billion after adjustments. Pre-earnings estimates from Wall Street had been for $1.44 per share on revenue of $23.949 billion, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. WFC earnings per share of 96 cents came in short of the average $1 estimate. However, EPS looked pretty decent after adjustments. The company also missed expectations on sales, and the stock fell in pre-market trading. The Producer Price Index (PPI) for December rose 0.3%, as expected. Core PPI was a bit above expectations. Though most eyes may be on bank earnings, retail sales, and PPI today, don’t forget there’s a bit more data scheduled later, including November business inventories and the University of Michigan’s first read on January sentiment. Also, watch for the weekly crude oil rig count from Baker Hughes, as it’s shown 10-straight weeks of increases and U.S. oil production has climbed. From a technical perspective, Thursday’s action seemed somewhat positive for the S&P 500 Index (SPX), though it finished lower on the day. Early on, the SPX had tumbled down toward long-term technical support in the 2252 area, but bounced back solidly by the end of the session. Sometimes a bounce off support signals technical strength that can filter into coming sessions. The choppy action might have reflected a bit of consolidation ahead of key earnings and data on Friday. Volatility Finally Shows Its Face After starting the year at its lowest levels for January in 10 years, the VIX finally broke out on Thursday, climbing 9% at one point to above 12 before retreating pretty dramatically by the end of the day. Perhaps it’s a sign that investors are starting to build in a chance for bigger market moves in the coming days. Additionally, the CBOE/CBOT U.S. Treasury Note Volatility Index, which has also been sinking lately, popped up a little. The volatility came after President-elect Donald Trump’s press conference on Wednesday, and ahead of a slew of data and earnings Friday. Perhaps the market is waking up a little, as a lot is going on right now. Bond Yields Retreat Since we’re on the subject of Treasuries, it’s worth noting that 10-year Treasury yields fell Thursday to their lowest level since late November. The morning low of 2.31% was down from highs of around 2.6% last month. Rates had been rising on hopes that the new administration could spark the economy with new spending and tax initiatives, but evidently some market participants were disappointed that Trump didn’t spend much time on those subjects at Wednesday’s press conference. Rates had also climbed as the market factored in the Fed’s plans for three rate hikes this year, and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said in prepared remarks Thursday that three rate hikes are appropriate. More Bank Earnings On Tap Got your fill of bank earnings today? Well, you have a three-day weekend to recuperate, then it’s back to the races Tuesday and Wednesday. Markets are closed Monday for the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday, but then Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) is scheduled to report first thing Tuesday, followed by Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) on Wednesday. And banks won’t be all. Several other big companies are on tap next week, including General Electric Company (NYSE: GE), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) and International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM). Everyone, start your engines! But first, have a nice long weekend.

It’s Complicated, Says Analyst Dick Bove Rising rates are good for banks because they boost earnings, but they're bad because they weigh on book value. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jan 13, 2017 at 10:48AM Whether higher rates are good or bad for a particular bank depends on a balancing act. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Much of the current excitement surrounding bank stocks stems from investors' belief that interest rates will continue to rise, sending bank profits higher as well. There's truth to this, writes longtime bank analyst Dick Bove in a recent research note, but there's more to the story than just this. Looking back to the 1970s In a report published Monday, Bove looked to the 1970s to get a sense for what's going on in the bank industry today. He did so because the 1970s were known for rapidly rising interest rates. By looking at what happened to bank stocks then, in turn, we can get a sense for what to expect now. Bank profits did in fact go up during that decade. Earnings per share among money center banks -- those like JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C) -- nearly tripled from 1971 to 1981, Bove notes. This makes sense when you consider that banks sell loans, the prices of which are dictated by interest rates. Higher rates mean higher loan prices. And higher loan prices mean higher interest income for banks. The 1970s paradox Given that interest rates soared throughout the 1970s -- short-term rates got as a high as 18% -- you'd think that the 1970s must have been a great decade for bank stocks. After all, higher profits should translate into higher valuation multiples for bank stocks. Effective Federal Funds Rate data by YCharts. But this isn't what happened. In fact, the multiples on bank stocks went in the other direction. The average price to earnings multiple for banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup went from more than 13.0 in 1972 down to less than 5.0 eight years later. What caused this paradoxical result? In short, because higher interest rates weigh on the price of fixed-income securities (which are a main component of any bank's asset portfolio). Bove says that higher interest rates are only good for banks so long as the benefit to profits outweighs the detriment to book value. According to Bove, What is driving the stock performance in the 1970s was not earnings but a number which one cannot show here since it was never published -- i.e., real book values. As interest rates rose the value of bank assets fell in real terms. This decline in real book values was not being replenished by earnings growth. Today vs. the 1970s Bove is absolutely right to point out that "interest rate changes are often not what is thought in valuing bank stocks." However, there are a couple of things that are worth pointing out. The first is that the 1970s and today, while similar because they were both periods of rising interest rates, are also very different. The 1970s was a particularly tumultuous decade for banks, and things got worse in the 1980s, as the savings and loan crisis gained momentum. The problem at the time wasn't just that interest rates were volatile. The more important issue was that they rose incredibly rapidly, as the Federal Reserve sought to combat a wave of double-digit inflation ignited by soaring energy prices thanks to two OPEC-led oil embargos that decade. This isn't as big of a problem today as there's little reason right now to be worried about a rapid rise in rates since we're still in the shadow of the financial crisis. Moreover, banks in the 1970s managed interest rate risk differently than they do today. After predecessor banks to JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup nearly failed because their cost of money (short-term rates) rose beyond what they earned on their fixed-rate loan portfolios (long-term rates), they began underwriting variable-rate loans. This is the model today -- indeed, one could go so far as to say that modern interest rate risk management was invented in the 1970s. The net result is that higher rates should translate into higher profits at a quicker rate today than they did four decades ago, and the downside shouldn't be as bad either. This is why Bank of America is so asset sensitive and will earn $5.3 billion more in additional net interest income once rates reach merely a percent higher than they were at the end of September. JPMorgan Chase isn't far behind at just under $3 billion, while Citigroup is closer to $2 billion. In sum, while Bove is right that higher rates will yield more income for banks, he's also right that they will weigh on book value. This is why the pace of rate hikes is so important. "Multiple increases in short periods are not positive for these stocks," says Bove. "Moderate increases over long periods are positive." John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America.

The Dow's gains were comparatively lesser, held back by a drop in consumer stocks after a report showed U.S. retail sales and core retail sales increased less than expected in December. Trading volumes were light ahead of a three-day weekend. Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo all reported quarterly profits that beat analysts expectations. Bank of America jumped as much as 2.1 percent to $23.41, their highest since the financial crisis. JPMorgan surged 2.2 percent at a record high of $88.17 and Wells Fargo gained 3.1 percent to $56.20. Goldman Sachs hit a more than nine-year high, while Morgan Stanley touched a more than eight-year high. Six of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, with the financial index's 1.23 percent rise leading the advancers. The KBW Bank index was up 1.64 percent, set for their best day since Dec. 1. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is estimated to have risen 5.7 percent in the fourth quarter, largely helped by financial companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "Financials have had a very good run post election and the data we've gotten today from the big banks has been very good and we do expect this sector to post strong earnings mostly due to the rising interest rate environment," said Jon Adams, senior investment strategist at BMO Global Asset Management. At 11:01 a.m. ET (1601 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was up 19.97 points, or 0.1 percent, at 19,910.97. The S&P 500 was up 6.81 points, or 0.29 percent, at 2,277.25. The Nasdaq Composite was up 31.87 points, or 0.57 percent, at 5,579.36. It had hit a record high of 5564.25. The biggest boost was from Facebook, which jumped 1.9 percent to $128.98 after a Raymond James upgraded the stock. U.S. stocks overall have been on the rise since the election on optimism that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's policies will benefit the economy. The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 percent since the election, outpacing the S&P 500's 6.1 percent rise. But, analysts fear the market has run too far too soon, with Trump's policies expected to hit legislature hurdles, and with stock valuations stretched. "There is a lot of optimism baked in 2017 as far as earnings go and we've come a long way very quickly so there's scope for a pullback, but overall the outlook for 2017 is relatively positive," said Adams. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,832 to 930. On the Nasdaq, 1,988 issues rose and 694 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 28 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 96 new highs and six new lows.

La Monica   @lamonicabuzz January 13, 2017: 10:19 AM ET Trump tapping top CEOs for advisory group JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon seems hopeful that better times for the economy lie ahead under President-elect Donald Trump. The bank reported better than expected profit for the fourth quarter Friday. And in its earnings release, Dimon suggested more good news could be coming for banks -- and for Americans -- in the months ahead. "The U.S. economy may be building momentum," Dimon said. "Looking ahead there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth, create jobs for Americans across the income spectrum and help communities." Dimon didn't mention Trump by name or cite specifics about the possibility of Trump and the Republican-led Congress unwinding some of President Obama's financial reforms. During a conference call with reporters, Dimon tempered his enthusiasm. "I'm usually an optimist. But I'm neither euphoric nor depressed," he said, adding that he is hopeful there will be more regulatory and tax reform. He added that it's too soon to tell what, if anything, will change in Washington. Dimon will clearly have a key role in helping the new president's economic policy though. Related: Wall Street hates the Volcker Rule. Will Trump kill it? Dimon is one of 16 CEOs on Trump's Strategic and Policy Forum, a group that also includes IBM (IBM, Tech30) CEO Ginni Rometty, Disney (DIS) CEO Bob Iger, GM (GM) CEO Mary Barra and Walmart (WMT) CEO Doug McMillon. Asked during the media call what advice he would whisper in Trump's ear, Dimon quipped, "I don't whisper." He declined to give specifics about what specifically he would suggest, saying there is no one big thing that must be addressed first. Answering a question from CNNMoney, Dimon said he was not overly worried about Trump's attacks against companies for doing business in Mexico or about his protectionist rhetoric -- even though JPMorgan Chase does business around the globe. Dimon said he's putting aside the Trump one-liners and is "comforted" that Trump has put "professionals" in the administration such as treasury nominee Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs exec, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary and former ExxonMobil (XOM) CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state. "Give him some time," Dimon said of Trump. Even though Dimon said there are still questions about what's next for banks, Wall Street seemed pleased with the results. JPMorgan Chase's (JPM) stock was up nearly 2% in early trading Friday following its earnings. The stock, along with that of other banks, has been on a tear since the election -- largely because of hopes for fewer regulations and rising interest rates, which would boost profits. Shares of JPMorgan Chase are up 23% since the election. Bank of America (BAC) has also risen sharply, and it, too, reported solid earnings Friday morning. BofA CEO Brian Moynihan didn't mention Trump either in his bank's earnings release. But he pointed out that the Fed, which raised interest rates last month and is expected to do so several more times this year, will help BofA. Related: Wells Fargo dumps toxic 'cross-selling' metric JPMorgan Chase CFO Marianne Lake echoed that during her bank's earnings call with reporters. She said the company was excited about more rate hikes but that it will take time for them to improve profits. "We are still at absolutely very low levels of rates," she noted. Scandal-ridden Wells Fargo (WFC) also reported its latest results on Friday morning. The bank, which was forced to admit last year that it opened up millions of fake accounts, disappointed Wall Street with earnings and sales that missed forecasts. But shares of both BofA and Wells Fargo rallied Friday along with JPMorgan Chase. Several other big banks, including Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS), will report their latest results next week.

 Here's the memo the CEO of JPMorgan's giant investment bank just sent to staff Matt Turner and Portia Crowe Jan. 13, 2017, 11:02 AM 32,639 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan JPMorgan on Friday reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat on the top and bottom lines. The corporate and investment bank, in particular, had its best revenue on record for a fourth quarter, according to CFO Marianne Lake. The markets business — including both fixed income and equities trading — also had its highest revenues on record for a fourth quarter. Fixed income revenues were up 31%, and equities revenues were up 8%. Investment banking revenue increased 1% from the quarter a year ago. Daniel Pinto, the CEO of the firm's corporate and investment bank, sent this memo to his staff to mark the occasion: "As part of today's firm-wide earnings, the CIB reported quarterly revenue of $8.5 billion, up 20% year-over- year and a fourth quarter record. We generated $3.4 billion of net income during the quarter and a return on equity of 20%. "For the full year, the CIB generated $35.2 billion of revenue, up 5% from 2015 and the best performance since 2009. Net income for the full year jumped to $10.8 billion, 34% higher than 2015, and we produced a return on equity of 16%. On all accounts, today's results are impressive. "Q4 2016 CIB performance highlights include (year-over- year): Screenshot "Our banking franchise remained #1 in global investment banking fees, and #1 in both North America and EMEA. J.P. Morgan was also the only investment bank in the top five to gain global wallet share in 2016. We finished the year ranked #2 in global M&A and advised on more deals than any other bank. We also ended 2016 as the top underwriter in both equity and debt capital markets, ranking #1 in IPOs and convertibles as well as high-yield bonds, high-grade bonds, and syndicated loans. In Treasury Services, revenues continued to rise, primarily due to higher interest rates and operating balances. "The momentum in Markets continued. We reported quarterly revenue of $4.5 billion, a fourth quarter record on the strength of record performances from both equities and fixed income. The higher trading volumes we witnessed in the third quarter carried through to the end of the year as investors actively positioned their portfolios in response to political developments and central bank actions. We witnessed particular strength in the credit markets as risk appetite increased on the back of better growth prospects for the US economy, an improvement in oil prices and a healthy third quarter earnings cycle."

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 13 January 2017 | MYT 10:07 PM JPMorgan results trump estimates as election stimulates trading JPMorgan’s net income rose 23.8% to US$6.73bil (RM30.03bil) in the three months ended Dec 31. - Reuters pic NEW YORK: JPMorgan Chase & Co, the No. 1 US bank by assets, reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue on Friday, helped by a surge in investor activity related to the US presidential election. The bank’s net income rose 23.8% to US$6.73bil (RM30.03bil) in the three months ended Dec 31, while earnings per share rose to US$1.71 from US$1.32. Excluding items, the bank earned US$1.58 per share, handily beating the average analyst estimate of US$1.44 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “We grew market share in virtually all of our businesses and showed expense discipline while continuing to invest for the future,” chief executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement. “The US economy may be building momentum,” he added. “Looking ahead there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth, create jobs for Americans across the income spectrum and help communities.” Donald Trump’s stunning victory on Nov 8 set off a wave of trading in stocks and bonds during what is normally a slow period for trading desks at big banks. Bank of America Corp, the second-largest US bank, kicked off the quarterly earnings period for big US lenders earlier on Friday, announcing a 46.8% rise in profit. The banks were also reporting their first results since the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate target for the second time since 2006 on Dec 14. Higher interest rates are usually good for banks, allowing them to charge higher rates on loans. Revenue from fixed-income trading - JPMorgan’s most volatile business - rose about 31% to US$3.37bil (RM15.0bil), while stock trading revenue increased 8.1% to US$1.15bil (RM5.11bil). That helped boost total net revenue by 2.5% to US$24.33bil (RM108.17bil), beating analysts average estimate of US$23.95bil (RM106.79bil). JPMorgan’s shares, which up to Thursday had risen about 23% since the election, were little changed in premarket trading. Bank stocks have been on a tear on the expectation that profits will be boosted by Trump’s plans to cut corporate taxes, ease regulatory restraints and boost infrastructure spending. The Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates by 0.25 percentage point in December, is expected to raise them again three times this year. JPMorgan said its fourth-quarter return on tangible common equity, a key performance measure, was 14% up from 11% a year-earlier. Total noninterest expenses fell 3% to US$13.83bil, primarily driven by lower legal expenses. Also on Friday, Wells Fargo, the largest US mortgage lender, reported a 6.4% fall in profit.

X ‘Trump trade’ surge lifts US investment banks to strong profits Results better than expected for key banking players after end-of-year boost in trading Fri, Jan 13, 2017, 15:27 JPMorgan posted a near-doubling of profit in the fourth quarter of 2016 at its investment banking division. Photograph: Reuters         A frenzy of trading after Donald Trump’s election as US president helped JPMorgan Chase deliver a near-doubling of profit in its investment banking unit in the fourth quarter, overcoming an indifferent performance from its core retail business. Similarly, high end-of-year trading volumes drove a better-than-expected 48 per cent rise in fourth-quarter profits at Bank of America, while US investment house BlackRock reported the largest net inflows of new client money in its history in 2016, despite a 5 per cent fall in net income for the year. The uptick comes after a tough end to 2015 when banks struggled with tough trading conditions.Shares in all the big US banks have been rising since the US Republicans’ sweep of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives, as investors have welcomed promises of higher interest rates, lower taxes and lighter regulation.  Five of the top 10 gainers on the S&P 500 since the election are banks, led by Goldman Sachs (+34 per cent) and Bank of America (+35 per cent). B of A kicked off the fourth-quarter earnings season yesterday with its forecast-busting rise in profits. “Few bank CEOs supported Mr Trump but they are benefiting nicely from his arrival,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at Michigan Ross. “Investors have to guess whether less regulation will lead banks to make decisions that are more rational and profitable, or more reckless and disaster-prone.” Investors will be combing through yesterday’s figures from JPMorgan, along with the update from Bank of America and a considerably weaker report from Wells Fargo, to assess whether share prices have run up too high, too soon. The past few years have been a tough time for most of the big banks, as they have faced the profit-sapping effects of tougher capital and liquidity standards, along with stubbornly low interest rates. ADVERTISEMENT Nonetheless, aggregate profits across the system keep grinding higher, as the banks have pushed out more loans and kept losses low, while finding new ways to charge fees. Quarterly net income at federally insured institutions was $45.6 billion in the third quarter, up 13 per cent from a year earlier. – (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017       Topics: Donald Trump House Of Representatives Senate White House Bank of America Goldman Sachs Group JPMorgan JPMorgan Chase Wells Fargo Read More EU and US strike deal to boost transatlantic insurance market Irish SPVs more a worry for other countries than State - academic Ulster Bank fixes glitch affecting customer payments BoI chief Richie Boucher joins board of Greek lender Italian banking crisis moves on to Unicredit’s €13bn cash call Student loan firm Future Finance looking to operate in Ireland Bitcoin tumbles amid fear of Chinese crackdown Ulster Bank staff in line for a 2 per cent pay increase Bus Eireann chief says threat of insolvency is very real Nurses to meet Department of Health in bid to avert industrial action Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy Oxfam report reveals ‘obscene’ gap between rich and poor Personal Finance Q&A: Dominic Coyle Politics Border tariff fears as UK edges towards hard Brexit Rugby Ulster unable to build on start as Exeter end European adventure Sponsored Plan your financial future and enjoy your dream retirement Leading the dance: 'Growing up competing I learned the drive to keep going' Redbreast Lustau: an old friend with a new whiskey perspective Making a difficult fertility journey a lot less lonely ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business New orders drive recovery in construction, latest data shows 01:00 Oxfam report reveals ‘obscene’ gap between rich and poor 00:02 Facebook Germany to start tackling fake news within weeks 19:28 Seen & Heard: Silver lining for Apollo House activists? 19:10 For your diary 19:00 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in Business 1 We could be looking at ‘hard Brexit’.

The Street seems to be satisfied with its mixed Q4 report, which consisted of a $0.02 beat for EPS, but came up shy by $900 million for revenues. After a higher open, it retreated and found support just under the top of Thursday's range ($23.12), reaching $23.11 and then continued its move higher. The ensuing rally has taken the issue through the multiple highs at the $23.30 area, including the former high for the move at $23.39, reaching $23.41. In order to post a new closing high for the recent rally, it would need to exceed its December 15 close of $23.16. Posted-In: Technicals Intraday Update Movers Trading Ideas © 2017 Benzinga.com.

Reuters Published Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 9:42AM EST Last updated Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 9:42AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Canada’s main stock index rose on Friday as heavyweight financial shares climbed, offsetting losses for energy and mining stocks as commodities fell. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was up 19.35 points, or 0.13 per cent, at 15,437.51, shortly after the open. Eight of the index’s 10 main groups were higher. U.S. stocks also opened higher on Friday after quarterly profits of Bank of America and JPMorgan beat expectations as fourth-quarter earnings kicked off. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 28.03 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 19,919.03. The S&P 500 gained 3.32 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 2,273.76. The Nasdaq Composite added 10.83 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 5,558.32. Shares of Bank of America rose 1..2 per cent to $23.20 in early trading after the lender’s quarterly profit beat estimates, but its revenue fell short. Wells Fargo was up. 1.6 per cent at $55.36 after it reported a fall in profit and its revenue fell short of market expectations. JPMorgan was up 1.4 per cent at $87.45 after its quarterly profit and revenue both topped analysts’ expectations. The combined profit of S&P 500 companies is estimated to have risen 5.7 per cent in the fourth quarter, largely helped by financial companies, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “There is a lot of optimism regarding the financial sector but any kind of cautious statement from them might cause a bit of a pullback,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. “All the changes that are being proposed for the sector is going to take some time, it’s not going to happen right away.” The S&P financial sector has jumped about 17 per cent since the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election, outpacing the S&P 500’s 6.1-per-cent rise, boosted by hopes of deregulation and increased interest rates. U.S. stocks overall have been on the rise since the election on optimism that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s policies to boost infrastructure spending and reform corporate taxes will benefit the economy. But, analysts fear the market has run too far too soon, with Mr. Trump’s policies expected to hit legislature hurdles, and with stock valuations stretched. Blackrock Chief Executive Larry Fink told CNBC that if the roll out of growth initiatives by Trump are slower, then the markets are ahead of themselves. Shares of the world’s largest asset manager were little changed after the company reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit. U.S. retail sales rose solidly in December amid strong demand for automobiles, with data showing retail sales increased 0.6 per cent last month, slightly below the 0.- per-cent increase expected by economists. A separate report at 10 a.m. ET is expected to show U.S. consumer sentiment improved to 98.5 in January from 98.2.

The nation's largest bank by assets said it earned $6.73 billion, or $1.71 per share, compared with a profit of $5.43 billion, or $1.32 per share, in the same period a year ago. The results beat analysts' forecast of $1.42 per share. The results included a tax benefit of $475 million. "Our results this quarter were a strong end to another record year," JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon said in a prepared statement. JPMorgan's investment bank division had a stellar quarter, reporting net income of $3.43 billion compared with $1.75 billion in the same period a year earlier. The bank's fixed income, currencies and commodities trading division reported a 31 percent jump in revenue, while stock trading had an 8 percent jump in revenue from the previous year. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market's big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. JPMorgan's consumer banking division, its largest business by revenue, had a sluggish quarter, reporting net income of $2.36 billion compared with $2.41 billion in the same period a year earlier. Most of the decline was tied into a drop in revenue from credit cards and auto loans. JPMorgan launched the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card last year, which became popular overnight. However, there were significant costs associated with the program. Overall revenue was $26.09 billion in the period. JPMorgan's adjusted revenue was $23.38 billion, which also beat Street forecasts. Five analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $23.24 billion. JPMorgan shares have decreased slightly since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index has risen slightly more than 1 percent. The stock has increased 46 percent in the last 12 months. _____ This story was partially generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

The bank’s fixed income, currencies and commodities trading division reported a 31 percent jump in revenue, while stock trading had an 8 percent jump in revenue from the previous year. Like most of Wall Street, JPMorgan benefited heavily from the stock market’s big rally that came after the U.S. presidential election. JPMorgan’s consumer banking division, its largest business by revenue, had a sluggish quarter, reporting net income of $2.36 billion compared with $2.41 billion in the same period a year earlier. Most of the decline was tied into a drop in revenue from credit cards and auto loans. JPMorgan launched the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card last year, which became popular overnight. However, there were significant costs associated with the program. Overall revenue was $26.09 billion in the period. JPMorgan’s adjusted revenue was $23.38 billion, which also beat Street forecasts. Five analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $23.24 billion. JPMorgan shares have decreased slightly since the beginning of the year, while the Standard & Poor’s 500 index has risen slightly more than 1 percent. The stock has increased 46 percent in the last 12 months. _____ This story was partially generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com/ap) using data from Zacks Investment Research.

And with expected economic stimulus and tax cuts likely to bring interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve, banks are expected to see continued profitability this year. JPMorgan Chase announced record profits for 2016, boosted by a "dynamic" US economy and a surge in brokerage activities.

Clary (AFP/File) Annual net profit rose 1.2 percent to $27.7 billion, including $6.73 billion in the fourth quarter alone. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $6.19 for the year which was above analysts' expectations. Bank of America said higher interest rates and an increase in consumer loans boosted earnings, but its business grew less than expected. Net profit in 2016 jumped 13 percent year-on-year to $16.2 billion, marked by a 46.8 jump in the fourth quarter. This resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $1.50 for the year. Bank of America, which had gained 35 percent on Wall Street since the November 8 election, fell 0.17 percent at 1225 GMT in pre-opening trading -- reflecting the disappointment of investors who expected the post-election euphoria to boost earnings further. While revenues from consumer loans increased as expected following the interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve in December, revenues from market activities were not as strong as hoped. "If the recent rate hike occurred too late to boost fourth quarter results, we anticipate a higher profit growth in the first quarter of 2017," chief financial officer Paul Donofrio said in a press release. The Fed has suggested it could raise rates three times this year, given that the Trump administration promises deregulation of the financial sector, massive tax cuts and large investments in infrastructure. Meanwhile, troubled Wells Fargo reported lower-than-expected 2016 results, hit by the scandal over thousands of fictitious accounts created without the knowledge of its clients. In the fallout the bank paid a fine of $185 million and the CEO resigned under pressure. Net profit fell 4.2 percent to $21.94 billion last year, including a drop of 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter alone due to a series of costly measures the bank implemented to regain consumer confidence. Earnings per share was $3.99 compared to the analysts' expectation of $4.03. Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

The bank's net income rose 23.8 percent to $6.73 billion in the three months ended Dec. 31, while earnings per share rose to $1.71 from $1.32. (http://bit.ly/2jeHFAY) Excluding items, the bank earned $1.58 per share, handily beating the average analyst estimate of $1.44 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. "We grew market share in virtually all of our businesses and showed expense discipline while continuing to invest for the future," Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement. "The U.S. economy may be building momentum," he added. "Looking ahead there is opportunity for good, rational and thoughtful policy decisions to be implemented, which would spur growth, create jobs for Americans across the income spectrum and help communities." Donald Trump's stunning victory on Nov. 8 set off a wave of trading in stocks and bonds during what is normally a slow period for trading desks at big banks. Bank of America Corp, the second-largest U.S. bank, kicked off the quarterly earnings period for big U.S. lenders earlier on Friday, announcing a 46.8 percent rise in profit. The banks were also reporting their first results since the Federal Reserve raised its key interest rate target for the second time since 2006 on Dec. 14. Higher interest rates are usually good for banks, allowing them to charge higher rates on loans. Revenue from fixed-income trading - JPMorgan's most volatile business - rose about 31 percent to $3.37 billion, while stock trading revenue increased 8.1 percent to $1.15 billion. That helped boost total net revenue by 2.5 percent to $24.33 billion, beating analysts average estimate of $23.95 billion. JPMorgan's shares, which up to Thursday had risen about 23 percent since the election, were little changed in premarket trading. Bank stocks have been on a tear on the expectation that profits will be boosted by Trump's plans to cut corporate taxes, ease regulatory restraints and boost infrastructure spending. The Federal Reserve, which raised interest rates by 0.25 percentage points in December, is expected to raise them again three times this year. JPMorgan said its fourth-quarter return on tangible common equity, a key performance measure, was 14 percent up from 11 percent a year-earlier. Total noninterest expenses fell 3 percent to $13.83 billion, primarily driven by lower legal expenses. Also on Friday, Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, reported a 6.4 percent fall in profit. Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley report earnings next week.
