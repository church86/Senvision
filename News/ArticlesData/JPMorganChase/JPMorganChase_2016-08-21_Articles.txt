Embed from Getty Images   Bloomberg News reports that the agreement with Deutsche Bank and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was signed on Friday, JPMorgan said in a regulatory filing. It resolves claims among the three parties over more than $6bn in securities backed by flawed Washington Mutual mortgages. JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has said that he would have demanded a much lower price for Washington Mutual given the unexpected legal costs from that deal and the acquisition of Bear Stearns Cos. The takeovers, done during the crisis, saddled the bank with billions of dollars of litigation and regulatory expenses.

They’re testing systems for exchanging collateral for the trades, signing new legal documents and pursuing regulatory approval for models that could help blunt the cost of compliance, according to lawyers, executives and consultants helping firms meet one of the biggest changes in decades to the swaps market. The hundreds of pages of restrictions taking effect are the result of years of deliberation by regulators around the world after the financial crisis when risk built up directly between traders. Global regulators estimate that the rules could eventually require more than €700 billion (RM3.19 trillion) in cash, government bonds and other forms of collateral to protect against the threat that the default of one trader spreads risk to others and potentially throughout the financial system. “This has been on the horizon for a while, but it was always going to be a challenging timetable and it’s just going to go right to the wire,” Deepak Sitlani, a London-based partner at Linklaters LLP law firm, said in an interview. Global deadline From the US to Japan, swap-dealing divisions of banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc, will have to start complying with the requirements on Sept. 1. In Europe, regulators said they couldn’t meet next month’s global deadline and intend for the rules to take effect early next year, threatening to fracture the market. Regulators in Singapore and Australia said today that they would postpone the requirements. Singapore said the decision would help avoid unintended disruptions to financial markets and takes into account cross-border coordination issues and the level of industry preparedness. Neither country set a new deadline. The Bank for International Settlements puts the size of the over-the-counter derivatives market at US$493 trillion as of the end of last year. US regulators said firms would eventually need about US$315 billion in initial margin to meet the requirements. Buyers and sellers of swaps in the EU market may need at least €200 billion, the bloc’s regulators said this year. The actual cost of financing collateral would be smaller, though the US Federal Reserve has said it could still cost banks billions of dollars. The rules take effect for big banks first and will be phased in for smaller firms. Banks and their clients must exchange variation margin to offset risks during the life of a transaction starting on March 1. ‘Compressed time frame’ “Final regulations from domestic regulators emerged relatively late in the day, in some cases less than six months before the scheduled Sept. 1 start date,” said Scott O’Malia, chief executive of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. “Given much of the detailed preparation and implementation couldn’t begin until final rules were published, this has meant a huge amount of complex work has had to be done in a very compressed time frame.” One of the banks’ top priorities ahead of the deadline is to get approval to use a framework developed by ISDA, the industry’s main trade group, for calculating margin requirements instead of the one-size-fits-all method set by regulators. Banks would be able to adjust ISDA’s system, known as the standard initial margin model, to fit their specific situation. ‘Significant multiples’ ISDA has said that it is essential for banks to be able to use models because the amounts of margin required under the regulators’ method are too onerous. The Fed in its final rule said it expected banks to be able to rely on models and that the amount of margin would be US$315 billion rather than the US$3.6 trillion the industry estimated based on the regulatory method. “You could easily be talking about the standardised numbers coming out as being very significant multiples of the SIMM results,” according to Nicholas Newport, managing director in London at InteDelta, a consulting firm that’s working with banks on the requirements. In the US, bank regulators must approve some models before they can be used, while the industry-funded National Futures Association is in charge of reviewing other models. NFA said its reviews could take 90 days and include an on-site exam. The NFA doesn’t plan to disclose its decisions, though firms could tell each other if they’ve won approval. ISDA is drafting standard legal documents for banks to comply with the rules. The rules have forced banks to have legal relationships with counterparties, set up accounts at custody banks where collateral can be deposited and seek opinions from law firms about contractual standards in countries around the world, lawyers said. Parent companies Many banks have multiple divisions that are registered in the US, each of which needs to set up new arrangements. European and Asian banks also have units that are registered in the US and may also need to meet the requirement even if their parent companies are headquartered abroad. “Even between just two dealers, you could have a number of legal entity pairings that require an IM arrangement,” Sitlani said, referring to initial margin. “Multiply that out by the number of dealers subject to the rules and you quickly get to a lot of new agreements that need to be signed up.” AcadiaSoft Inc, a Norwell, Massachusetts-based company owned and backed by the industry runs a system that is designed to help firms automate the process of managing collateral. Thirty financial entities are participating in the system and 700 people across the firms have been working on the project since the beginning of the year, said Chris Walsh, AcadiaSoft’s chief executive. “The infrastructure is in place,” Walsh said in an interview. “But there is still a lot of on-boarding and testing.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Australia’s Crown Resorts casino staff arrested in China Lufthansa pilots’ strike wreaks havoc on flight schedule Healthcare stocks drag Wall Street lower UK’s Hammond sets target for cyclically-adjusted budget deficit Chinese-made US$100b city in Johor 'scares the hell out of everybody' Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: China goes global as Trump puts America first Reuters Video: Facebook crafts censorship tool to re-enter China, says NYT Reuters Video: Antigua PM gives Prince Harry awkward honeymoon invite MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants MMOTV: A Red Shirts supporter hurls abuse at Bersih supporters Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

 BOUTIQUE BLOWOUT: 3 tiny firms will make a killing on a $14 billion pharma deal Portia Crowe Aug. 22, 2016, 8:53 AM 6,238 facebook linkedin twitter email print Andrew Burton/Getty Images Pfizer is buying the cancer drugmaker Medivation for $14 billion, and three small banks helped make it happen. Guggenheim Securities and Centerview Partners advised Pfizer on the deal, while JPMorgan and Evercore advised Medivation. Guggenheim and Centerview are expected to split between $40 million and $50 million in buy-side fees, while JPMorgan and Evercore's combined sell-side fees will be about $50 million to $60 million, according to the consultant Freeman & Co. Guggenheim was founded in 1999 and has since grown to employ about 2,500 people throughout the US, Europe, and Asia. It recently advised St. Jude Medical on its $25 billion sale to Abbott Labs and Verizon on its recent deal for Yahoo. Guggenheim also advised on Pfizer's failed deal for Allergan. Centerview lists 30 partners on its website. It recently advised NBCUniversal on its $3.8 billion deal for DreamWorks and Unilever on its deal for Dollar Shave Club. Centerview had also advised Pfizer on the Allergan deal before that was blocked. Evercore was founded in 1996 by Roger Altman, David Offensend, and Austin Beutner. It lists around 80 senior managing directors in corporate advisory globally on its website. It was the sole adviser to Tesla on its recent deal for SolarCity.

Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell: Medivation — Pfizer announced a $14 billion deal to acquire the biotech firm in an all-cash transaction. The deal is worth $81.50 per share and Pfizer expects it to add 5 cents per share to earnings in the first year.

Syngenta — Syngenta's deal to be bought by ChemChina for $43 billion has been cleared by a U.S. national security panel. The pesticides maker said it still expects the deal to be finalized by the end of 2016. Facebook — Facebook shares could rise by more than 20 percent over the next year, according to Barron's.

Dauman will remain as non-executive chairman through September 13. Volkswagen — Volkswagen will resume contract talks with suppliers today, trying to resolve a dispute that has halted auto production at some of its plants.

Discover Financial Services — The credit card issuer announced plans to repurchase an additional $100 million of its common shares between now and June 30, 2017.

Vice President Pat Wagner has been appointed interim CFO while the search for a permanent replacement is conducted. Office Depot — The office supplies retailer announced that CEO Roland Smith plans to retire, but will stay on until a successor is found.

"It is as simple as that, so if you are in trading mode to the long side, be aware that she can hurt you with tough talk and take you to new heights with talk of staying the course until we get better data," the "Mad Money" host said. Yellen and the Fed face a problem in that job growth has been strong but wages have stayed stagnant. There would be no point in hiking rates, other than the fear of inflation, Cramer said. The world's transition to digitization and globalization are wage crushers. However, if Yellen determines that a rate hike should occur, Cramer advised to own the financial stocks like Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. He pinned Wells Fargo as his favorite of the group. "She's smart, so I'm betting Yellen simply argues we don't have enough data yet to draw a conclusion," Cramer said. With the U.S. central bank in mind, Cramer outlined the stocks and events he will be watching this week. And while it is a somewhat slow week, he was stunned by how big they were: While investors chattered about Pfizer's $14 billion bid for Medivation on Monday, Cramer was focused on other news. "I know everyone was playing the 'who's next' game in biotech, but if you want to find the next big takeover target, I think the chip stocks offer a more fertile hunting ground," he said. Instead, Cramer had his eye on the news that Japan's Renesas is considering a bid to buy U.S. semiconductor maker Intersil for $3 billion. "The true M&A hot spot isn't biotech, it's semiconductors," Cramer said. Additionally, Cramer says the theory that brick-and-mortar retailers are losers that cannot overthrow Amazon is completely wrong. "The conventional wisdom about shopping has been totally wrong … This past quarter put the lie to that supposition in so many ways," the "Mad Money" host said. Amazon's $50 billion in domestic sales in the past year was an indicator to Cramer that there is market share for everyone, as the U.S. had $4.71 trillion in retail sales during the same time period. Brick-and-mortars, which once seemed like zombies, once again have a pulse. "That is why we need to bury the whole 'death of the mall' narrative right this minute, because so many mall-based stores put up good numbers with good commentary," Cramer said. Reuters Janet Yellen enters the opening reception of the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming August 21, 2014. There have also been some tremendous initial public offerings that have produced gains, such as Acacia Communications and Twilio. "If you bought either of those stocks on my recommendation, I suggest you ring the register on some of your winnings — no need to be greedy," Cramer said. However, some IPOs have not done so well. At Home Group is the home furnishings super-store that came public two weeks ago at $15 per share, and has barely moved since then. After researching it thoroughly, Cramer ultimately determined that while he likes the story behind Home, it is still too early. He recommended that it should not be a core holding in anyone's portfolio, but for those who can handle speculation, then they can buy it with their discretionary funds. One of Cramer's favorite themes currently is the growing demand for cellphone towers around the world. The business model is essentially that a company puts up a cell tower, and then it can lease the space to multiple wireless antenna arrays from various carriers. Given the competition between Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint for market share, he considers the cell tower companies to be the arms dealers in the battle for subscribers. American Tower Corp is a real estate investment trust that owns the largest amount of cell towers in the world, with more than 144,000. Cramer noted the rapid growth occurring overseas, with huge increases in data traffic and need for more towers. He spoke with American Tower's Chairman and CEO Jim Taiclet, who explained that most of India still uses second generation equipment, while the U.S. is on third generation equipment. However, once Apple begins to sell iPhones in India, it could present a tremendous growth opportunity for the future. "We are the leading independent tower company in India. A country with 1.3 billion people, about four times as many as the U.S. So, there is a lot of upside," Taiclet said. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few caller favorite stocks: XPO Logistics: "I don't know. When you own XPO, you just have Brad Jacobs [CEO] on it. The stock was dramatically lower, they reported a great quarter and the stock has gone higher. Now it is resting, but I do like it. I think the business is very strong. Jacobs gave us some real good insight." JetBlue: "I think you hop on the flight, you have a really good time. You watch TV, and then you don't buy the stock. This stock to me does not offer a lot of upside. And that group is very, very painful."

Another big deal , and another payday most of Wall Street's biggest banks missed. The Pfizer -Medivation deal announced Monday, worth about $14 billion, is the latest sign that boutique banks are rising on Wall Street. In 2016, the smaller banks have been claiming a bigger portion of the profits that come from large-scale mergers and acquisitions, something they have been able to do after claiming some of the top dealmakers from big Wall Street banks. When Pfizer negotiated to buy the biopharmaceutical company, it was advised by boutiques Guggenheim Securities and Centerview Partners; its target, Medivation, was advised by JPMorgan Securities and Evercore . That is expected to generate a payday of up to $50 million for Pfizer's advisors, and nearly $60 million for the banks that advised Medivation, said Jeffrey Nassof, director at M&A consulting firm Freeman & Co. In the first half of 2016, boutique banks saw their wallet share of M&A (that is to say, what portion of revenue from deals that went to banks) rise to 17 percent, just shy of their all-time high on a percentage basis. It's a sign that companies engaging in M&A are less dependent on mega-banks than they once were. While boutiques — notably, Guggenheim and Centerview — have elbowed top Wall Street firms aside on health-care and pharmaceutical deals, smaller banks have also won the opportunity to work on large technology deals, including Wal-Mart 's buy of Jet.com , Microsoft 's $26.2 billion buy of LinkedIn and Verizon's deal to acquire Yahoo. There are still plenty of industries where Wall Street has maintained dominance, however, Nassof points out. They includes businesses like consumer retail and industrials, where boutique banks have done little in the way of taking more M&A business from top banks.

 What you need to know on Wall Street right now Business Insider Aug. 22, 2016, 12:53 PM 1,265 facebook linkedin twitter email print Harry How/Getty Finance Insider is Business Insider's summary of the top stories of the past 24 hours. To sign up, scroll to the bottom of this page and click "Get updates in your inbox," or click here. Pfizer just outbid numerous competitors for Medivation, a cancer drugmaker with just one approved drug. The $14 billion deal, at $81.50 a share, is a  notable premium to the $9.3 billion offer the pharma giant Sanofi had made earlier this year.  Here's why the deal is such a game-changer . Business Insider has just published a series of big picture pieces, and they're definitely worth a read.  'Hedge fund' doesn't mean anything anymore. Central bankers are doing something that hasn't happened in 5,000 years — and drastically changing the world economy. One move almost always sets off chaos in the currency market. In other news, the newest stocks in the market have some good news for investors, hedge fund managers are waiting for the world to change, and Folger Hill Asset Management has lost a third of its assets.  In macro news, calling for more government spending has become a mainstream consensus view, and it's time to talk about "Fed watching." The oil sell-off may not mean anything for the stock market, and energy companies are facing another huge problem. Bonnie Baha, DoubleLine's director of global credit, has died. Finally, Kobe Bryant has set up a $100 million venture capital fund. Here are the top Wall Street headlines at midday: BOUTIQUE BLOWOUT: 3 tiny firms will make a killing on a $14 billion pharma deal - Guggenheim Securities and Centerview Partners advised Pfizer on the deal, while JPMorgan and Evercore advised Medivation. Costco's credit card nightmare just got even worse - Costco's marriage to Visa has been rocky pretty much from the start — and this weekend, shoppers faced a new problem, despite assurances that issues in the relationship were being ironed out. Here's why Wall Street hasn't innovated anything since the ATM - Wall Street has a serious innovation problem. Valeant poached a new CFO from the animal-health company Zoetis - The embattled drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals is hiring a new chief financial officer from an animal-health company. STIGLITZ: Italy could be the 'cataclysmic event' that leads to the fall of the eurozone - Europe is heading towards a "cataclysmic event" that could lead to the collapse of the euro and the end of the European project as we know it, according to Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz. Welcome to the 'self-driving car of finance' - Everyone is talking about blockchain. TECH INVESTOR: We're in a huge bubble — but it's not what you think - What links Walmart's $3 billion purchase ofJet.com, Unilever buying up Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion, and GM buying Cruise for $1 billion?

Firms are testing systems for exchanging collateral for the trades, signing new legal documents and pursuing regulatory approval for models that could help blunt the cost of compliance, according to lawyers, executives and consultants helping firms meet one of the biggest changes in decades to the swaps market. The rules are taking effect in the U.S. and Japan on Sept. 1, while the European Union, Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia have announced delays. The hundreds of pages of restrictions are the result of years of deliberation by regulators around the world after the financial crisis when risk built up directly between traders. Global regulators estimate that the rules could eventually require more than 700 billion euros ($790 billion) in cash, government bonds and other forms of collateral to protect against the threat that the default of one trader spreads risk to others and potentially throughout the financial system. “This has been on the horizon for a while, but it was always going to be a challenging timetable and it’s just going to go right to the wire,” Deepak Sitlani, a London-based partner at Linklaters LLP law firm, said in an interview. Global Deadline In the U.S. to Japan, swap-dealing divisions of banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc., will have to start complying with the requirements on Sept. 1. In Europe, regulators said they couldn’t meet next month’s global deadline and intend for the rules to take effect early next year, threatening to fracture the market. Regulators in Singapore and Australia said in statements on Monday that they will take more time to impose the requirements. Singapore said the decision would help avoid unintended disruptions to financial markets and takes into account cross-border coordination issues and the level of industry preparedness. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also decided to delay “due to recent developments in other major jurisdictions,” a spokesperson said by e-mail. The three jurisdictions didn’t set new deadlines. The Bank for International Settlements puts the size of the over-the-counter derivatives market at $493 trillion as of the end of last year. U.S. regulators said firms would eventually need about $315 billion in initial margin to meet the requirements. Buyers and sellers of swaps in the EU market may need at least 200 billion euros, the bloc’s regulators said this year. ‘Complex Work’ The actual cost of financing collateral would be smaller, though the U.S. Federal Reserve has said it could still cost banks billions of dollars. The rules take effect for big banks first and will be phased in for smaller firms. Banks and their clients must exchange variation margin to offset risks during the life of a transaction starting on March 1. Start your day with what’s moving markets.

You will now receive the Technology newsletter “Final regulations from domestic regulators emerged relatively late in the day, in some cases less than six months before the scheduled Sept. 1 start date,” said Scott O’Malia, chief executive of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association. “Given much of the detailed preparation and implementation couldn’t begin until final rules were published, this has meant a huge amount of complex work has had to be done in a very compressed time frame.” One of the banks’ top priorities ahead of the deadline is to get approval to use a framework developed by ISDA, the industry’s main trade group, for calculating margin requirements instead of the one-size-fits-all method set by regulators. Banks would be able to adjust ISDA’s system, known as the standard initial margin model, to fit their specific situation. ‘Significant Multiples’ ISDA has said that it is essential for banks to be able to use models because the amounts of margin required under the regulators’ method are too onerous. The Fed in its final rule said it expected banks to be able to rely on models and that the amount of margin would be $315 billion rather than the $3.6 trillion the industry estimated based on the regulatory method. “You could easily be talking about the standardized numbers coming out as being very significant multiples of the SIMM results,” according to Nicholas Newport, managing director in London at InteDelta, a consulting firm that’s working with banks on the requirements. In the U.S., bank regulators must approve some models before they can be used, while the industry-funded National Futures Association is in charge of reviewing other models. NFA said its reviews could take 90 days and include an on-site exam. The NFA doesn’t plan to disclose its decisions, though firms could tell each other if they’ve won approval. Law Firms ISDA is drafting standard legal documents for banks to comply with the rules. The rules have forced banks to have legal relationships with counterparties, set up accounts at custody banks where collateral can be deposited and seek opinions from law firms about contractual standards in countries around the world, lawyers said. Many banks have multiple divisions that are registered in the U.S., each of which needs to set up new arrangements. European and Asian banks also have units that are registered in the U.S. and may also need to meet the requirement even if their parent companies are headquartered abroad. “Even between just two dealers, you could have a number of legal entity pairings that require an IM arrangement,” Sitlani said, referring to initial margin. “Multiply that out by the number of dealers subject to the rules and you quickly get to a lot of new agreements that need to be signed up.” AcadiaSoft Inc., a Norwell, Massachusetts-based company owned and backed by the industry runs a system that is designed to help firms automate the process of managing collateral. Thirty financial entities are participating in the system and 700 people across the firms have been working on the project since the beginning of the year, said Chris Walsh, AcadiaSoft’s chief executive. “The infrastructure is in place,” Walsh said in an interview. “But there is still a lot of on-boarding and testing.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Please use a supported version for the best MSN experience. The upside to losing half your money The Motley Fool 8/22/2016 Morgan Housel Investment firm Horizon Research Group wrote a paper a few years ago about a group of art dealers (and their relatives) who made fortunes in the 19th and 20th century. A small handful of dealers ended up owning massive collections of masterworks by Picasso, Matisse, and Klee, worth hundreds of millions of dollars. What's incredible is that the value of art is subjective. It's impossible to know what new piece of art will be worth 100 years from now, since value is driven by taste. Some of these dealers were buying paintings that hadn't even been produced yet – they didn't know what the art would look like, let alone what particular artist would be admired decades down the road. But they ended up making fortunes on them. "How were they able to choose so wisely?" the researchers asked. It wasn't just luck, because the handful of dealers all did the same thing. "The great investors bought vast quantities of art," Horizon wrote. The dealers traveled around buying as much art as they possibly could from as many artists as they could find. Literally thousands and thousands of paintings. They diversified. "A subset of the collections turned out to be great investments, and they were held for a sufficiently long period of time to allow the portfolio return to converge upon the return of the best elements in the portfolio." They basically owned an index and sat back, knowing most of the paintings would be duds but a few would explode. Which is exactly how investing works. One of the most amazing investing studies I've seen is a JPMorgan paper showing the percentage of Russell 3000 companies that suffered "catastrophic loss" from 1980 to 2014. A catastrophic loss is when a stock falls 70% or more and never recovers. The Russell 3000 increased 49-fold from 1980 to 2014. But, amazingly, 40% of companies in the index had catastrophic losses.  No industry was spared: © Provided by Fool G JPMorgan's data shows 64% of stocks underperformed the overall index from 1980-2014. About a third were reasonable winners, and 7% of components absolutely knocked it out of the park. The return of those 7% was enough to not only offset the losers, but push the entire index up almost 50-fold. © Provided by Fool G This is no different than what the art dealers accomplished. The key making a lot of money is to own so much stuff that you guarantee capitalism will destroy most of your investments, but equally sure than a tiny group of successes will offset those losses. Over time, the overall return converges on the best elements of the portfolio. The benefits of diversification are well known. But I wonder how many index fund owners realize half their hard-earned money is going up in flames – by design. My guess is, not many. Which is a reminder that we should focus on how our whole portfolios are performing over any individual component, and be more sympathetic when reading news about another company going up in flames. They are, after all, the norm. For more: Why does pessimism sound so smart? Why we're terrified of typical Is today's market more volatile than the past?

By Paul Walsh paul.walsh@information-partners.com August 22, 2016 11:58 AM GMT UBS’s leading blockchain researcher Alex Batlin will be joining BNY Mellon, Global Custodian understands. A source at BNY Mellon confirmed that Batlin will be taking a role at the custodian bank but could not provide further comment. Batlin, who has previously held roles at JP Morgan and Nomura, was responsible for UBS’s Crypto 2.0 Pathfinder programme researching blockchain technology. Batlin’s previous roles at UBS also include group CTO for applied innovation as well as global head of CTO research services. Batlin’s start date and job title are yet to be confirmed but the appointment may signal the custodian banks’ desire to increase its understanding of blockchain technology given the potential threat to traditional custody operations it possesses. Blockchain technology has been hailed as the future of the industry, with potential to streamline processes such as settlement, clearing and corporate actions. The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority’s (FCA) director of strategy Chris Woolard has confirmed the FCA is talking to a number of firms working on blockchain technology and how it will be applied to the financial services.

"IBRANCE and XTANDI are anchor brands in breast and prostate cancer respectively, giving Pfizer leadership in two hormone-driven cancers. Similar to IBRANCE in the breast cancer setting, XTANDI is being explored for its potential to move from metastatic prostate cancer to treat earlier stages of non-metastatic prostate cancer. In addition, Medivation's portfolio within prostate cancer and across diverse tumors will complement Pfizer's broad IO portfolio. Finally, Medivation adds commercial scale to better compete with other top tier oncology companies in advance of the potential emergence of Pfizer's IO pipeline expected in the next few years. Together, we believe Pfizer and Medivation can bring the full force of our combined research and resources to combat two of the most common cancers, as well as speed cures and make accessible breakthrough medicines to patients, redefining life with cancer." Cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the U.S. and a "Top 10" killer worldwide. According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer and prostate cancer are among the top three cancers by annual incidence in the U.S. There are several parallels between breast and prostate cancer, including the incidence of prostate cancer in the U.S., which is similar to that of breast cancer with approximately 280,000 cases per year. Pfizer expects to finance the transaction with existing cash. Under the terms of the merger agreement, a subsidiary of Pfizer will commence a cash tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Medivation common stock for $81.50 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest, subject to any required withholding of taxes. The closing of the tender offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including U.S. antitrust clearance and the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Medivation common stock. The merger agreement contemplates that Pfizer will acquire any shares of Medivation that are not tendered into the offer through a second-step merger, which will be completed promptly following the closing of the tender offer. Pfizer expects to complete the acquisition in the Third- or Fourth-Quarter 2016. Pfizer's financial advisors for the transaction were Guggenheim Securities and Centerview Partners, with Ropes & Gray LLP acting as its legal advisor. J.P. Morgan Securities and Evercore served as Medivation's financial advisors, while Cooley LLP and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz served as its legal advisors.

DISCLOSURE NOTICE: This release, and statements on the accompanying call, contains forward-looking information related to Pfizer, Medivation and the proposed acquisition of Medivation by Pfizer that involves substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Forward-looking statements in this release and the accompanying call include, among other things, statements about the potential benefits of the proposed acquisition, anticipated earnings accretion and growth rates, Pfizer's and Medivation's plans, objectives, expectations and intentions, the financial condition, results of operations and business of Pfizer and Medivation, XTANDI and Medivation's other pipeline assets, IBRANCE (palbociclib), and the anticipated timing of closing of the acquisition. Risks and uncertainties include, among other things, risks related to the satisfaction of the conditions to closing the acquisition (including the failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals) in the anticipated timeframe or at all, including uncertainties as to how many of Medivation's stockholders will tender their shares in the tender offer and the possibility that the acquisition does not close; risks related to the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including the possibility that the expected benefits from the proposed acquisition will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully; disruption from the transaction making it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships; negative effects of this announcement or the consummation of the proposed acquisition on the market price of Pfizer's common stock and on Pfizer's operating results; significant transaction costs; unknown liabilities; the risk of litigation and/or regulatory actions related to the proposed acquisition; other business effects, including the effects of industry, market, economic, political or regulatory conditions; future exchange and interest rates; changes in tax and other laws, regulations, rates and policies; future business combinations or disposals; the uncertainties inherent in research and development, including the ability to sustain and increase the rate of growth in revenues for XTANDI despite increasing competitive, reimbursement and economic challenges; Medivation's dependence on the efforts and funding by Astellas Pharma Inc. for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of XTANDI; the ability to meet anticipated trial commencement and completion dates and regulatory submission dates, as well as the possibility of unfavorable clinical trial results, including unfavorable new clinical data and additional analyses of existing clinical data; whether and when any drug applications may be filed in any jurisdictions for any additional indications for IBRANCE, XTANDI or for Medivation's other pipeline assets; whether and when regulatory authorities may approve any such applications, which will depend on its assessment of the benefit-risk profile suggested by the totality of the efficacy and safety information submitted; decisions by regulatory authorities regarding labeling and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of IBRANCE, XTANDI and Medivation's other pipeline assets; and competitive developments. A further description of risks and uncertainties relating to Pfizer and Medivation can be found in their respective Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and in their subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, all of which are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and available at www.sec.gov. The information contained in this release is as of August 22, 2016. Neither Pfizer nor Medivation assumes any obligation to update forward-looking statements contained in this release as the result of new information or future events or developments. Pfizer calculates projections regarding the expected accretive impact of the potential acquisition based on internal forecasts of its Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (Adjusted Diluted EPS), which forecasts are non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial measures derived by excluding certain amounts that would be included in GAAP calculations. These accretion projections should not be considered a substitute for GAAP measures. The determinations of the amounts that are excluded from the accretion calculations are a matter of management judgment and depend upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts. Pfizer is unable to present quantitative reconciliations because management cannot reasonably predict with sufficient reliability all of the necessary components of the comparable GAAP measure. Pfizer has excluded from the accretion calculations the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. Such items can have a substantial impact on GAAP measures of financial performance. For more information on the Adjusted Diluted EPS measure see Pfizer's 2015 Financial Report, which was filed as exhibit 13 to Pfizer's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and Pfizer's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended July 3, 2016.
