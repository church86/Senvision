"Following" : "Follow"}} June 01, 2017 11:57am   Comments Share: Related FN 20 Biggest Mid-Day Gainers For Tuesday 25 Stocks Moving In Tuesday's Pre-Market Session The valuation of Fabrinet (NYSE: FN) led JPMorgan to add the tech manufacturer to the firm's focus list Thursday. JPMorgan has an Overweight on Fabrinet and raised their price target on the stock from $55 to $57. “We believe the recent sell-off (down 28 percent since Feb. 21 peak/S&P up 2 percent) presents an attractive GARP entry point. We are buyers here," analyst Paul Costersaid in a note. Why A Top Pick? 100G deployments in North America have been driving growth for optical components, and Chinese demand is set to pick up soon, Coster said. Fabrinet is likely to benefit from this upgrade cycle, the analyst said. Fabrinet's operating leverage should increase “as opex grows slower than revenues with management indicating capacity for improvement driven by scale and as new facilities begin to ramp," according to the JPMorgan note. Fabrinet has developed a larger footprint with their campus in Santa Clara and with Exception EMS in the UK. These locations provide “turnkey solutions and prototypes getting in early during the design cycle," Coster said. Fabrinet Chief Financial Officer Toh-Seng Ng had a positive tone at JPMorgan’s TMT conference, according to the firm's note. Fabrinet was trading up 4.6 percent late Thursday morning.

Photos Videos Topics Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education Health TRENDING# ICC Champions Trophy 2017 Cow Slaughter Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 News Business News GLOBAL MARKETS-Italy leads Europe shares up after data highlights recovery Shares0 Thu, 1 Jun 2017-07:11pm , Reuters Bank shares lagged slightly after two major U. S. lenders, JPMorgan and Bank of America, warned on Wednesday that low market volatility would crimp trading revenue. European stocks rose on Thursday with Italy setting the pace after a big upward revision in first-quarter economic growth, while the dollar rose after forecast-beating U.S. private sector jobs data. Wall Street was expected to open higher, according to index futures , after the jobs numbers which are likely to feed into the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision later this month. The pan-European STOXX 600 index edged up 0.3 percent, led higher by industrials and consumer staples companies. Bank shares lagged slightly after two major U.S. lenders, JPMorgan and Bank of America, warned on Wednesday that low market volatility would crimp trading revenue. Italy's FTSE MIB index was the top gaining national market, up 0.6 percent and fractionally outperforming France's CAC 40. Italy's national statistics bureau said strong domestic demand helped the economy grow 0.4 percent in the first quarter, twice as much as indicated by preliminary data issued last month. The euro zone economy as a whole grew 0.5 percent in the period and, in a further sign of recovery, data on Thursday showed manufacturing grew in May at its fastest rate in six years. Stronger euro zone data has helped push the euro higher against the dollar of late, contributing to the U.S. currency's worst fortnight since March 2016. However, the greenback rose 0.4 percent on Thursday, hitting session highs after data showed the private sector added 253,000 jobs in May, above economists' forecasts. The ADP data comes a day before the more comprehensive non-farm payrolls report and a fortnight before the Fed is expected to raise interest rates. Asian shares, as measured by MSCI's main index of Asia-Pacific shares, excluding Japan rose 0.1 percent, though gains were limited by data showing Chinese factory activity contracted in May for the first time in 11 months. Chinese Shanghai Composite share index fell 0.5 percent after a private survey of the manufacturing sector. The findings contrasted with official data on Wednesday that suggested growth remained steady. China's yuan, however, strengthened beyond 6.8 per dollar for the first time since Nov. 11 after the central bank pushed its reference rate, around which the spot rate can fluctuate, 0.8 percent higher in the second-largest single-day appreciation of the currency since it was de-pegged from the dollar in 2005. Traders said major state-owned banks were selling dollars. "The PBOC has let the yuan bulls loose in the China shop," said Stephen Innes, senior trader at OANDA in Australia, referring to the People's Bank of China. Spot yuan last stood at 6.8066 per dollar, having strengthened as far as 6.7878 earlier. As recently as May 24, it traded at 6.8949 per dollar. Britain's pound, on a rollercoaster ride this week as polls have sent conflicting signals about the outcome of next week's election, fell 0.2 percent to $1.2866 after another poll showed the Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives just 3 percentage points ahead of the Labour opposition. There was little reaction to Britain's manufacturing PMI beating forecasts. "This data point is clearly a positive for the UK economy however GBP traders are putting macro releases on the back burner at present, with the twists and turns in the race for upcoming election having a greater impact on the market of late," David Cheetham, markets analyst at broker XTB, said. The euro was down 0.3 percent at $1.1209, having fallen as low as $1.1201 after the ADP data. The Japanese yen was down 0.5 percent to 111.32 per dollar. Oil prices initially rose, lifting off Wednesday's three-week lows, after data showing a big drop in U.S. crude stocks last week, but pared gains as some participants doubted output cuts by OPEC would be enough to rebalance an oversupplied market. Brent crude, the international benchmark for the oil market, was down 13 cents at $50.63 a barrel at 1243 GMT. President Donald Trump is expected to announce later on Thursday whether he will withdraw the United States from the Paris accord on measures to fight climate change. Phillip Futures' investment analyst Jonathan Chanes said a U.S. withdrawal would signal Trump's intention to further roll back emission regulations. "That would favour the use and demand of fossil fuels," Chanes said.

By MARLEY JAYAAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article NEW YORK — U.S. stock indexes edged lower for the second day in a row Wednesday as a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for technology companies canceled out gains for drugmakers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell hard as executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. An eight-day winning streak for technology companies ended. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drugmakers, and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The New York Stock Exchange was evenly split between gainers and losers. “The stock market has been strong and all the while bond yields have dropped during the year,” signaling caution about the economy, said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Management. “In the next couple of months we’re going to solve which is right: the bond market or the stock market.” The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 1.11 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65. The Nasdaq composite fell 4.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,198.52. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks slipped 0.99 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,370.21. Banks had skidded a day earlier as bond yields dropped, which hurts banks by forcing interest rates on loans lower. Yields were little changed Wednesday, but financial firms fell again as investors worried that banks’ revenue from trading stocks, bonds and currencies is going to weaken in the second quarter. At a financial industry conference in New York, Marianne Lake, JPMorgan Chase’s chief financial officer, said JPMorgan’s trading revenue is down about 15 percent this quarter because of a drop in fixed-income trading. She said that was because of low interest rates and remarkably low market volatility. “There is not a lot to trade around,” she said. “People have cash but no conviction.” At a different industry event Wednesday, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said second-quarter trading revenue will fall 10 percent compared with a year ago. The banking industry had an outstanding first quarter, and trading was a key reason. On Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase fell $1.75, or 2.1 percent, to $82.15 and Bank of America lost 43 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $22.41. Capital One slumped $1.36, or 1.7 percent, to $76.92 and Goldman Sachs, which saw its vaunted trading business hit a speed bump in the first quarter, gave up $7.16, or 3.3 percent, to $211.26. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.21 percent. Technology companies turned lower. The tech sector has reached its highest levels since the dot-com boom, and companies like Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook have done far better than the rest of the market in 2017. Apple and Facebook are up 32 percent this year, and Alphabet is up 25 percent. All three slid Wednesday. Pfizer rose 52 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $32.65 and Irish drugmaker Perrigo climbed $4.93, or 7.3 percent, to $72.85 after its first-quarter report was better than expected. Health care products maker Johnson & Johnson advanced $1.14 to $128.25. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.34, or 2.7 percent, to $48.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, fell $1.53, or 3 percent, to $50.31 a barrel in London. Energy stocks continued to decline. Exxon Mobil sank 60 cents to $80.50 and Hess declined 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $45.89. Michael Kors Holdings hit a five-year low after it said it will close up to 125 stores as its sales have remained weak. The luxury retailer said sales at older stores dropped in its latest quarter and investors were disappointed with its projections for the current quarter. The stock tumbled $3.09, or 8.5 percent, to $33.18. Solar power companies sank as investors wondered if President Trump will seek to remove the U.S. from the Paris climate change accords. Officials from the European Union said the EU and China will maintain their commitments to the pact. Shares of First Solar, the largest U.S. solar company, declined 99 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $38.51. SunPower fell 28 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $7.87 while solar wafer maker Canadian Solar retreated 73 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $12.81. The dollar slipped to 110.57 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro rose to $1.1246 from $1.1188. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Heating oil gave up 3 cents to $1.52 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 7 cents to $3.07 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold rose $9.70 to $1,265.40 an ounce. Silver fell 2 cents to $17.41 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.58 a pound. European stocks gave up an early gain. The DAX in Germany remained up 0.1 percent, but France’s CAC 40 lost 0.4 percent and the British FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index dipped 0.1 percent and South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.2 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong inched down 0.1 percent.

Catalyst Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials BLink Portfolio Stocks Forex Commodities Gold & Silver Today's Pick Portfolio Tracker Wall Street little changed as financials drop, defensive stocks gain Reuters comments   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet June 1, 2017:   US stocks were little changed on Wednesday as financials dropped after JPMorgan and Bank of America warned of revenue weakness, offsetting gains in defensive plays. JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 per cent decline in trading revenue in the current quarter compared with last year, while Bank of America said trading revenue in the second quarter was on track to be 10 to 12 per cent lower than last year. Financials rallied more than 20 per cent in the wake of the US presidential election on hopes of fiscal stimulus and deregulation under President Donald Trump, but they have struggled in recent weeks. The sector is now down 0.3 per cent on the year. “All the things that Trump told us were going to happen, which was infrastructure spend, deregulation, tax reform, people dont believe any of those will happen, certainly the magnitude and with the speed the market had originally priced in,” said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities at BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago. “That is why youve seen a lot of the move back, specifically banks.” Measures of market volatility are at rock-bottom, hitting trading desks at big banks. The US stock market's main gauge of investor anxiety closed at its lowest level in over two decades on May 8 and has not topped its long-term average of 20 since November. It did, however, hit a seven-day high of 11.30 on Wednesday. JPMorgan shares lost 2.1 per cent, while Bank of America was down 1.9 per cent as the two biggest weights on the S&P 500. Goldman Sachs fell 3.3 per cent, the biggest drag on the Dow. Defensive plays such as utilities, up 0.46 per cent and telecoms, up 0.35 per cent, were the bright spots as enthusiasm fades for sectors that would benefit from Trump policies. Energy stocks, down 0.4 per cent, also lost ground. Oil prices touched a three-week low as rising output from Nigeria and Libya fuelled concerns that OPEC-led output cuts are being undermined. US crude settled down 2.7 per cent at $48.32 a barrel and Brent settled 3 per cent lower at $50.1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20.82 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 21,008.65, the S&P 500 lost 1.1 points, or 0.05 per cent, to 2,411.81 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.67 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 6,198.52. Shares of Michael Kors plunged 8.5 per cent to $33.18. The luxury fashion retailer gave a bleak full-year forecast and said it would shut more than 100 full-price retail stores in the next two years. Mallinckrodt closed down 1.2 per cent at $43.13 after sources said the drugmaker is exploring a sale of its generic drug unit for as much as $2 billion. Analog Devices rose 1.1 per cent to $85.76 after the chipmaker's quarterly results came in above expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.04-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows. About 7.85 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, above the 6.72 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

This Alice-in-Wonderland world of sub-zero interest rates – bonds which, if held to maturity, result in a loss for investors as bondholders effectively pay governments for the privilege of lending them money – appeared to be slowly returning to normal towards the end of last year. Yet in its latest negative yield index monitor, published last month, which tracks and analyses the international stock of sovereign bonds offering yields below zero per cent, JPMorgan notes that the share of negative-yielding debt in its benchmark index for government bonds in developed markets has been rising again over the past few months. The increase, moreover, is attributable to the renewed decline in bond yields in Europe, a region that has been enjoying surprisingly robust economic growth this year and which, under the normal circumstances, ought to be experiencing a rise in yields as economic conditions improve. However, according to JPMorgan, while the stock of negative-yielding bonds in the index for government bonds in developed markets has fallen significantly from a peak of nearly US$13 trillion in July 2016, it started rising again in March, increasing from just over US$8 trillion in February to nearly US$10 trillion by mid-April before retreating to US$9.2 trillion in early May. The main reason for the renewed increase is a reduction in perceived political risk in the euro zone following the victory of pro-European centrist Emmanuel Macron in France’s presidential election last month. Since the first round of the election in late April, when it became clear that Macron was a virtual shoo-in for the presidency, the stock of negative-yielding debt in France shot up by US$60 billion, according to JPMorgan, helping drag down yields elsewhere in the euro zone, especially in Italy which, given the country’s political and banking-sector woes, would have suffered the most from a victory for the far-right in France’s election. France’s 10-year yield, which was above 1 per cent in mid-March, has sunk to 0.7 per cent (pretty much where it stood at the beginning of this year) while its two-year equivalent is once again falling deeper into negative territory, dropping to minus 0.5 per cent. What is more disturbing, however, is that even short-term borrowing costs in Italy – the next focal point of investor concern in Europe following the favourable outcome of France’s election – are back in negative territory after being positive for most of this year. It borders on the absurd that as much as US$3 trillion of the bloc’s government debt is still trading with a negative yield in a region whose economy is enjoying its fastest growth in six years According to JPMorgan, as much as US$450 billion of Italian government debt is now trading with a negative yield, accounting for nearly one-sixth of the 35 per cent or so of bonds in JPMorgan’s benchmark euro-zone government bond index currently in negative territory. That even in the euro zone – whose economy grew by a faster-than-expected 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year (outpacing the US) and which is expected to expand by an even brisker 0.7 per cent in the second quarter – more than a third of government debt still trades in negative territory shows just how distorted global asset prices have become. Much, if not all, of the blame lies with central banks, especially the European Central Bank and its Japanese counterpart, whose aggressive quantitative easing programmes are keeping bond yields anchored at historically low levels despite a pick-up in growth and inflation in both regions, most noticeably in the euro zone. In last month’s global fund manager survey produced by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, a record number of respondents claimed that global monetary policy had become too loose. While the ECB’s caution over withdrawing stimulus is justified, given the persistently subdued level of core inflation (which excludes volatile energy and food prices) in the euro zone, it borders on the absurd that as much as US$3 trillion of the bloc’s government debt is still trading with a negative yield in a region whose economy is enjoying its fastest growth in six years. Quite aside from the damaging effects of negative yields on the performance of long-term institutional investors, particularly pension funds and insurers, sub-zero-yielding debt has allowed market sentiment to become dangerously detached from countries’ underlying fundamentals. France may have averted a full-blown crisis by electing Macron as president, but Italy may not be as fortunate when it holds a crucial parliamentary election, possibly as early as this autumn. In the coming months, negative-yielding Italian bonds may emerge as the most conspicuous case of mispricing in global markets.

US stocks were little changed on Wednesday as financials dropped after JPMorgan and Bank of America warned of revenue weakness, offsetting gains in defensive plays. JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 percent decline in trading revenue in the current quarter compared with last year, while Bank of America said trading revenue in the second quarter was on track to be 10 to 12 percent lower than last year. Financials rallied more than 20 percent in the wake of the US presidential election on hopes of fiscal stimulus and deregulation under President Donald Trump, but they have struggled in recent weeks. The sector is now down 0.3 percent on the year. "All the things that Trump told us were going to happen, which was infrastructure spend, deregulation, tax reform, people don‘t believe any of those will happen, certainly the magnitude and with the speed the market had originally priced in," said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities at BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago. "That is why you have seen a lot of the move back, specifically banks." Measures of market volatility are at rock-bottom, hitting trading desks at big banks. The U.S. stock market's main gauge of investor anxiety closed at its lowest level in over two decades on May 8 and has not topped its long-term average of 20 since November. It did, however, hit a seven-day high of 11.30 on Wednesday. JPMorgan shares lost 2.1 percent while Bank of America was down 1.9 percent as the two biggest weights on the S&P 500. Goldman Sachs fell 3.3 percent, the biggest drag on the Dow. Defensive plays such as utilities , up 0.46 percent and telecoms , up 0.35 percent, were the bright spots as enthusiasm fades for sectors that would benefit from Trump policies. Energy stocks , down 0.4 percent, also lost ground. Oil prices touched a three-week low as rising output from Nigeria and Libya fuelled concerns that OPEC-led output cuts are being undermined. U.S. crude settled down 2.7 percent at $48.32 a barrel and Brent settled 3 percent lower at $50.1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65, the S&P 500 lost 1.1 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,411.81 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.67 points, or 0.08 percent, to 6,198.52. Shares of Michael Kors plunged 8.5 percent to $33.18. The luxury fashion retailer gave a bleak full-year forecast and said it would shut more than 100 full-price retail stores in the next two years. Mallinckrodt closed down 1.2 percent at $43.13 after sources said the drugmaker is exploring a sale of its generic drug unit for as much as $2 billion. Analog Devices rose 1.1 percent to $85.76 after the chipmaker's quarterly results came in above expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.04-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows.About 7.85 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 6.72 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. tags #Business #markets #Wall Street Related news Business Smooth implementation of GST will grow industry: Britannia Ind Jun 05, 2017 09:35 AM Business Single GST rate would have been disastrous; bank, investment revival the ‘bull's eye’ now: FM Jun 05, 2017 09:34 AM Business Salman Khan to launch electric bicycles under Being Human Jun 05, 2017 09:26 AM Business This day, that year: World's first 'practical' PC goes on sale Jun 05, 2017 08:20 AM Business Centre exploring ways to make Air India profitable: Jayant Sinha Jun 05, 2017 07:45 AM Business There is 'political confusion' in Tamil Nadu: Rahul Gandhi Jun 04, 2017 08:58 PM Politics Mine auction row: Punjab CM rules out any arbitrary action Jun 04, 2017 08:45 PM Business Trade Setup for Monday: Top 10 things you should know before Opening Bell Jun 04, 2017 08:05 PM Business World Bank report says demonetisation will provide long-term benefits Jun 04, 2017 07:22 PM News Most Popular Top News How Ravi Narain built the NSE, and then lost his grip Book profits @ 9700 on Nifty; 5 stocks which can return up to 14% in short term Wipro chief Azim Premji took home 63% less salary, zero commission in FY17 What green initiatives are banks taking towards climate change?

By MARLEY JAYAAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article NEW YORK — U.S. stock indexes edged lower for the second day in a row Wednesday as a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for technology companies canceled out gains for drugmakers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell hard as executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. An eight-day winning streak for technology companies ended. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drugmakers, and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The New York Stock Exchange was evenly split between gainers and losers. “The stock market has been strong and all the while bond yields have dropped during the year,” signaling caution about the economy, said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Management. “In the next couple of months we’re going to solve which is right: the bond market or the stock market.” The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 1.11 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65. The Nasdaq composite fell 4.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,198.52. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks slipped 0.99 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,370.21. Banks had skidded a day earlier as bond yields dropped, which hurts banks by forcing interest rates on loans lower. Yields were little changed Wednesday, but financial firms fell again as investors worried that banks’ revenue from trading stocks, bonds and currencies is going to weaken in the second quarter. At a financial industry conference in New York, Marianne Lake, JPMorgan Chase’s chief financial officer, said JPMorgan’s trading revenue is down about 15 percent this quarter because of a drop in fixed-income trading. She said that was because of low interest rates and remarkably low market volatility. “There is not a lot to trade around,” she said. “People have cash but no conviction.” At a different industry event Wednesday, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said second-quarter trading revenue will fall 10 percent compared with a year ago. The banking industry had an outstanding first quarter, and trading was a key reason. On Wednesday, JPMorgan Chase fell $1.75, or 2.1 percent, to $82.15 and Bank of America lost 43 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $22.41. Capital One slumped $1.36, or 1.7 percent, to $76.92 and Goldman Sachs, which saw its vaunted trading business hit a speed bump in the first quarter, gave up $7.16, or 3.3 percent, to $211.26. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.21 percent. Technology companies turned lower. The tech sector has reached its highest levels since the dot-com boom, and companies like Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook have done far better than the rest of the market in 2017. Apple and Facebook are up 32 percent this year, and Alphabet is up 25 percent. All three slid Wednesday. Pfizer rose 52 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $32.65 and Irish drugmaker Perrigo climbed $4.93, or 7.3 percent, to $72.85 after its first-quarter report was better than expected. Health care products maker Johnson & Johnson advanced $1.14 to $128.25. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.34, or 2.7 percent, to $48.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, fell $1.53, or 3 percent, to $50.31 a barrel in London. Energy stocks continued to decline. Exxon Mobil sank 60 cents to $80.50 and Hess declined 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $45.89. Michael Kors Holdings hit a five-year low after it said it will close up to 125 stores as its sales have remained weak. The luxury retailer said sales at older stores dropped in its latest quarter and investors were disappointed with its projections for the current quarter. The stock tumbled $3.09, or 8.5 percent, to $33.18. Solar power companies sank as investors wondered if President Trump will seek to remove the U.S. from the Paris climate change accords. Officials from the European Union said the EU and China will maintain their commitments to the pact. Shares of First Solar, the largest U.S. solar company, declined 99 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $38.51. SunPower fell 28 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $7.87 while solar wafer maker Canadian Solar retreated 73 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $12.81. The dollar slipped to 110.57 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro rose to $1.1246 from $1.1188. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Heating oil gave up 3 cents to $1.52 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 7 cents to $3.07 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold rose $9.70 to $1,265.40 an ounce. Silver fell 2 cents to $17.41 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.58 a pound. European stocks gave up an early gain. The DAX in Germany remained up 0.1 percent, but France’s CAC 40 lost 0.4 percent and the British FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index dipped 0.1 percent and South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.2 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong inched down 0.1 percent.

Executives of the two biggest US banks said second-quarter trading revenue was set to drop at least 10 percent, according to media reports. In 2.45pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.15 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.3 percent. In 2.30pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced shed 0.21 percent. The Dow weakened as slides in shares of Goldman Sachs and those of JPMorgan Chase, down 3.4 percent and 2.4 percent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Pfizer and those of Johnson & Johnson, recently up 1.7 percent and 1 percent respectively. Shares of Bank of America dropped 2.9 percent as of 2.58pm in New York. In other earnings disappointments, shares of Michael Kors sank, down 9 percent as of 3.07pm, after the luxury fashion retailer offered a full-year earnings outlook that fell short of expectations. It also announced plans to close between as many as 125 of its full-price retail stores over the next two years. Also sliding was the price of oil amid fresh concern about the global glut. “There doesn’t seem to be an end to supply out there,” Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, told Bloomberg. “And demand is not exactly rip-roaring." Meanwhile, a National Association of Realtors report showed its pending home sales index fell 1.3 percent to 109.8 in April, from a downwardly revised 111.3 in March. Significantly weak supply levels are spurring deteriorating affordability conditions, Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said in the report. “Much of the country for the second straight month saw a pullback in pending sales as the rate of new listings continues to lag the quicker pace of homes coming off the market," according to Yun. “Realtors are indicating that foot traffic is higher than a year ago, but it's obviously not translating to more sales." “Prospective buyers are feeling the double whammy this spring of inventory that's down 9 percent from a year ago and price appreciation that's much faster than any rise they've likely seen in their income,” Yun noted. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.21 percent decline from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index fell 0.1 percent, while France’s CAC40 Index dropped 0.4 percent. Germany’s DAX Index rose 0.1 percent. A YouGov poll showed that UK Prime Minister Theresa May could lose control of parliament in in next month’s election. When asked by a reporter if she would resign if she lost seats, May dodged the question, saying that the only poll that mattered was the election on June 8, Reuters reported.

Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print NEW YORK — U.S. stock indexes edged lower for the second day in a row Wednesday as a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for technology companies canceled out gains for drugmakers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell hard as executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. An eight-day winning streak for technology companies ended. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drugmakers, and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The New York Stock Exchange was evenly split between gainers and losers. RELATED: Searchable stock indexes “The stock market has been strong and all the while bond yields have dropped during the year,” signaling caution about the economy, said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Management. “In the next couple of months we’re going to solve which is right: the bond market or the stock market.” The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 1.11 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65. The Nasdaq composite fell 4.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,198.52. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks slipped 0.99 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,370.21. Banks skidded a day earlier as bond yields dropped, which hurts banks by forcing interest rates on loans lower. Yields were little changed Wednesday, but financial firms fell again as investors worried that banks’ revenue from trading stocks, bonds and currencies is going to weaken in the second quarter. At a financial industry conference in New York, Marianne Lake, JPMorgan Chase’s chief financial officer, said JPMorgan’s trading revenue is down about 15 percent this quarter because of a drop in fixed-income trading. She said that was because of low interest rates and remarkably low market volatility. “There is not a lot to trade around,” she said. “People have cash but no conviction.” At a different industry event Wednesday, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said second-quarter trading revenue will fall 10 percent compared to a year ago. The banking industry had an outstanding first quarter, and trading was a key reason. JPMorgan Chase fell $1.75, or 2.1 percent, to $82.15 and Bank of America lost 43 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $22.41. Capital One slumped $1.36, or 1.7 percent, to $76.92 and Goldman Sachs, which saw its vaunted trading business hit a speed bump in the first quarter, gave up $7.16, or 3.3 percent, to $211.26. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.21 percent. Technology companies turned lower. The tech sector has reached its highest levels since the dot-com boom and companies like Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook have done far better than the rest of the market in 2017. Apple and Facebook are up 32 percent this year, and Alphabet is up 25 percent. All three slid Wednesday. Pfizer rose 52 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $32.65 and Irish drugmaker Perrigo climbed $4,93, or 7.3 percent, to $72.85 after its first-quarter report was better than expected. Health care products maker Johnson & Johnson advanced $1.14 to $128.25. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.34, or 2.7 percent, to $48.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, fell $1.53, or 3 percent, to $50.31 a barrel in London. Energy stocks continued to decline. Exxon Mobil sank 60 cents to $80.50 and Hess declined 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $45.89. Michael Kors Holdings hit a five-year low after it said it will close up to 125 stores as its sales have remained weak. The luxury retailer said sales at older stores dropped in its latest quarter and investors were disappointed with its projections for the current quarter. The stock tumbled $3.09, or 8.5 percent, to $33.18. Solar power companies sank as investors wondered if President Donald Trump will seek to remove the U.S. from the Paris climate change accords. Officials from the European Union said the EU and China will maintain their commitments to the pact. Shares of First Solar, the largest U.S. solar company, declined 99 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $38.51. SunPower fell 28 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $7.87 while solar wafer maker Canadian Solar retreated 73 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $12.81. The dollar slipped to 110.57 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro rose to $1.1246 from $1.1188. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Heating oil gave up 3 cents to $1.52 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 7 cents to $3.07 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold rose $9.70 to $1,265.40 an ounce. Silver fell 2 cents to $17.41 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.58 a pound. European stocks gave up an early gain. The DAX in Germany remained up 0.1 percent, but France’s CAC 40 lost 0.4 percent and the British FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index dipped 0.1 percent and South Korea’s Kospi gained 0.2 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong inched down 0.1 percent.

Ogg May 31, 2017 1:20 pm EDT Print Email Tweet In late 2016 the markets rallied and rallied, and then they kept rallying into 2017. The financial services sector was one of the biggest beneficiaries of the Trump bump. The nation’s top money center banks fared incredibly well because they had the most to gain from deregulation and in a gradually rising interest rate environment. Now zoom forward to the end of May. Things are different, and that is right before the slow summer months. The Dow is still up 6.4% and the S&P 500 Index up 8% so far in 2017, but the financials have barely risen, and some are still down. On top of other growth drivers affecting the banks now looking less rosy, both Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) have harmed the financials by talking down expectations on trading revenues in the second quarter. JPMorgan was signaling a 15% drop in trading revenues so far in the second quarter due to lower volatility. Bank of America’s trading revenues were also indicated to be lower by CEO Brian Moynihan. Other recent concerns have weighed on bank stocks. An unhealthy credit environment in car loans being more risky and delinquent has been hard to ignore, and credit card delinquency rates were also higher in the most recent quarter. On top of this new down-draft of news, some investors have dialed down expectations on just how aggressive the Federal Reserve will be on interest rate hikes in 2017 and in 2018, at the same time that growth expectations just are not coming in as high as the markets had previously hoped. Many of the Trump agenda efforts have also been pushed back on when and dialed down on how big, and many investors still wonder if any big changes will be seen this year or next. And on the long-term interest rate front, rates just haven’t stayed higher and that is a risk to the markets, based on growth expectations. The 10-year Treasury note was last seen with a 2.21% yield, when  yield — a measure of inflation expectations that also influences rates on different types of credit — slipped one basis point to 2.21% after having hit 2.60% in March of this year. And there is one more consideration about why the bank stock performance is so troubling. Bull markets usually cannot continue without the performance of the financial sector. They are large in value and their earnings broadly reflect the overall economic picture. Bank of America shares were last seen trading down almost 2.4% at $22.30. The bank’s stock chart matters here as the $20 handle has been a hard floor of support going all the way back to December. The shares are down from a 52-week and multiyear high of $25.80, and its consensus analyst price target is still up at about $26. Bank of America’s book value per share was listed as $24.19 in April, with a tangible book value per share of $17.14. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C), the money center bank that trades at the biggest book value discount, was trading down just over 2% at $60.40 on Wednesday. It is down from a 52-week high of $62.69 but its shares were still up over 3% in 2017. Citi’s book value per share in April was $75.86, with a tangible book value of $65.94 per share. JPMorgan was down 1.8% at $82.37 a share. Team Dimon’s shares were last seen down almost 3% so far in 2017. Its book value was listed as $64.68 per share in April, and its tangible book value was $52.04 per share. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) traded down 3% at $211.89. The top financial stock of the Dow Jones Industrial Average is now down more than 8% so far in 2017, making it the worst of the big money center banks and brokerages featured here. Goldman Sachs has a serious pivot level to watch closely around $210. Goldman Sachs listed its book value at $184.98 in mid-April. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) was last seen down 2% at $41.44, but it was literally at a flat line for performance in 2017. This stock is up over 50% from a year ago. Morgan Stanley’s book value and tangible book value per common share at the end of the first quarter were listed as $37.48 and $32.49, respectively. Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC) traded down almost 1.8% to $51.22, and the stock is now down 5.3% so far in 2017 and down about 10% over the past quarter. With its problems of the unapproved bank account openings for many customers, the stock is up the least of the entire group here, with a 2.5% gain from a year ago. Wells Fargo continues to trade at the largest book value premium versus peers, with its stated book value at the end of the first quarter at $35.70 per share. Its tangible book value per share was $29.79. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Jon C.

Executives of the two biggest US banks said second-quarter trading revenue was set to drop at least 10 percent, according to media reports. In 2.45pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.15 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.3 percent. In 2.30pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced shed 0.21 percent. The Dow weakened as slides in shares of Goldman Sachs and those of JPMorgan Chase, down 3.4 percent and 2.4 percent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Pfizer and those of Johnson & Johnson, recently up 1.7 percent and 1 percent respectively. Shares of Bank of America dropped 2.9 percent as of 2.58pm in New York. In other earnings disappointments, shares of Michael Kors sank, down 9 percent as of 3.07pm, after the luxury fashion retailer offered a full-year earnings outlook that fell short of expectations. It also announced plans to close between as many as 125 of its full-price retail stores over the next two years. Also sliding was the price of oil amid fresh concern about the global glut. “There doesn’t seem to be an end to supply out there,” Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, told Bloomberg. “And demand is not exactly rip-roaring.” Meanwhile, a National Association of Realtors report showed its pending home sales index fell 1.3 percent to 109.8 in April, from a downwardly revised 111.3 in March. Significantly weak supply levels are spurring deteriorating affordability conditions, Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said in the report. “Much of the country for the second straight month saw a pullback in pending sales as the rate of new listings continues to lag the quicker pace of homes coming off the market,” according to Yun. “Realtors are indicating that foot traffic is higher than a year ago, but it’s obviously not translating to more sales.” “Prospective buyers are feeling the double whammy this spring of inventory that’s down 9 percent from a year ago and price appreciation that’s much faster than any rise they’ve likely seen in their income,” Yun noted. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.21 percent decline from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index fell 0.1 percent, while France’s CAC40 Index dropped 0.4 percent. Germany’s DAX Index rose 0.1 percent. A YouGov poll showed that UK Prime Minister Theresa May could lose control of parliament in in next month’s election.

Executives of the two biggest US banks said second-quarter trading revenue was set to drop at least 10 percent, according to media reports. In 2.45pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.15 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 0.3 percent. In 2.30pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced shed 0.21 percent. The Dow weakened as slides in shares of Goldman Sachs and those of JPMorgan Chase, down 3.4 percent and 2.4 percent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Pfizer and those of Johnson & Johnson, recently up 1.7 percent and 1 percent respectively. Shares of Bank of America dropped 2.9 percent as of 2.58pm in New York. In other earnings disappointments, shares of Michael Kors sank, down 9 percent as of 3.07pm, after the luxury fashion retailer offered a full-year earnings outlook that fell short of expectations. It also announced plans to close between as many as 125 of its full-price retail stores over the next two years. Also sliding was the price of oil amid fresh concern about the global glut. “There doesn’t seem to be an end to supply out there,” Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA in New York, told Bloomberg. “And demand is not exactly rip-roaring.” Meanwhile, a National Association of Realtors report showed its pending home sales index fell 1.3 percent to 109.8 in April, from a downwardly revised 111.3 in March. Significantly weak supply levels are spurring deteriorating affordability conditions, Lawrence Yun, NAR chief economist, said in the report. “Much of the country for the second straight month saw a pullback in pending sales as the rate of new listings continues to lag the quicker pace of homes coming off the market,” according to Yun. “Realtors are indicating that foot traffic is higher than a year ago, but it’s obviously not translating to more sales.” “Prospective buyers are feeling the double whammy this spring of inventory that’s down 9 percent from a year ago and price appreciation that’s much faster than any rise they’ve likely seen in their income,” Yun noted. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.21 percent decline from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index fell 0.1 percent, while France’s CAC40 Index dropped 0.4 percent. Germany’s DAX Index rose 0.1 percent. A YouGov poll showed that UK Prime Minister Theresa May could lose control of parliament in in next month’s election. When asked by a reporter if she would resign if she lost seats, May dodged the question, saying that the only poll that mattered was the election on June 8, Reuters reported.

JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 per cent decline in trading revenue in the current quarter compared with last year, while Bank of America said trading revenue in the second quarter was on track to be 10 to 12 per cent lower than last year. Financials rallied more than 20 per cent in the wake of the US presidential election on hopes of fiscal stimulus and deregulation under President Donald Trump, but they have struggled in recent weeks. The sector is now down 0.3 per cent on the year. “All the things that Trump told us were going to happen, which was infrastructure spend, deregulation, tax reform, people don’t believe any of those will happen, certainly the magnitude and with the speed the market had originally priced in,” said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities at BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago. “That is why you’ve seen a lot of the move back, specifically banks.” Measures of market volatility are at rock-bottom, hitting trading desks at big banks. The US stock market's main gauge of investor anxiety closed at its lowest level in over two decades on May 8 and has not topped its long-term average of 20 since November. It did, however, hit a seven-day high of 11.30 yesterday. JPMorgan shares lost 2.1 per cent while Bank of America was down 1.9 per cent as the two biggest weights on the S&P 500. Goldman Sachs fell 3.3 per cent, the biggest drag on the Dow. Defensive plays such as utilities, up 0.46 per cent and telecoms up 0.35 per cent, were the bright spots as enthusiasm fades for sectors that would benefit from Trump policies. Energy stocks, down 0.4 per cent, also lost ground. Oil prices touched a three-week low as rising output from Nigeria and Libya fuelled concerns that Opec-led output cuts are being undermined. US crude settled down 2.7 per cent at US$48.32 (RM206.75) a barrel and Brent settled 3 per cent lower at US$50.10. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20.82 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 21,008.65, the S&P 500 lost 1.1 points, or 0.05 per cent, to 2,411.81 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.67 points, or 0.08 per cent, to 6,198.52. Shares of Michael Kors plunged 8.5 per cent to US$33.18. The luxury fashion retailer gave a bleak full-year forecast and said it would shut more than 100 full-price retail stores in the next two years. Mallinckrodt closed down 1.2 per cent at US$43.13 after sources said the drugmaker is exploring a sale of its generic drug unit for as much as US$2 billion. Analog Devices rose 1.1 percent to US$85.76 after the chipmaker's quarterly results came in above expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.04-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows. About 7.85 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, above the 6.72 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Malaysia Airlines close to deal for more widebody Airbus planes Pound falls after London terror attacks raise political tensions Ringgit opens higher against US dollar PBOC has economy's back even as it squeezes leverage from market Oil subdued as rising US output undermines Opec effort to cut supply Ringgit likely to trade higher versus US dollar next week RHB-AmBank to take No. 1 spot in asset management, insurance, broking Petronas Q1 2017 pre-tax profit more than doubles to RM15.5b British pound in thrall to election projections as market jitters rise Bursa to be firmer next week Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: With rave reviews, 'Wonder Woman' readies to launch Reuters Video: Francois Ozon's 'L'Amant Double' shocks at Cannes Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • U.S. stock indexes edged lower for the second day in a row Wednesday as a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for technology companies canceled out gains for drugmakers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell hard as executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. An eight-day winning streak for technology companies ended. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drugmakers, and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The New York Stock Exchange was evenly split between gainers and losers. "The stock market has been strong and all the while bond yields have dropped during the year," signaling caution about the economy, said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Management. "In the next couple of months we're going to solve which is right: the bond market or the stock market." VIDEOS TOP JOBS The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 1.11 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65. The Nasdaq composite fell 4.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,198.52. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks slipped 0.99 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,370.21. Banks skidded a day earlier as bond yields dropped, which hurts banks by forcing interest rates on loans lower. Yields were little changed Wednesday, but financial firms fell again as investors worried that banks' revenue from trading stocks, bonds and currencies is going to weaken in the second quarter. At a financial industry conference in New York, Marianne Lake, JPMorgan Chase's chief financial officer, said JPMorgan's trading revenue is down about 15 percent this quarter because of a drop in fixed-income trading. She said that was because of low interest rates and remarkably low market volatility. "There is not a lot to trade around," she said. "People have cash but no conviction." At a different industry event Wednesday, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said second-quarter trading revenue will fall 10 percent compared to a year ago. The banking industry had an outstanding first quarter, and trading was a key reason. JPMorgan Chase fell $1.75, or 2.1 percent, to $82.15 and Bank of America lost 43 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $22.41. Capital One slumped $1.36, or 1.7 percent, to $76.92 and Goldman Sachs, which saw its vaunted trading business hit a speed bump in the first quarter, gave up $7.16, or 3.3 percent, to $211.26. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.21 percent. Technology companies turned lower. The tech sector has reached its highest levels since the dot-com boom and companies like Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook have done far better than the rest of the market in 2017. Apple and Facebook are up 32 percent this year, and Alphabet is up 25 percent. All three slid Wednesday. Pfizer rose 52 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $32.65 and Irish drugmaker Perrigo climbed $4,93, or 7.3 percent, to $72.85 after its first-quarter report was better than expected. Health care products maker Johnson & Johnson advanced $1.14 to $128.25. Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.34, or 2.7 percent, to $48.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, fell $1.53, or 3 percent, to $50.31 a barrel in London. Energy stocks continued to decline. Exxon Mobil sank 60 cents to $80.50 and Hess declined 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $45.89. Michael Kors Holdings hit a five-year low after it said it will close up to 125 stores as its sales have remained weak. The luxury retailer said sales at older stores dropped in its latest quarter and investors were disappointed with its projections for the current quarter. The stock tumbled $3.09, or 8.5 percent, to $33.18. Solar power companies sank as investors wondered if President Donald Trump will seek to remove the U.S. from the Paris climate change accords. Officials from the European Union said the EU and China will maintain their commitments to the pact. Shares of First Solar, the largest U.S. solar company, declined 99 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $38.51. SunPower fell 28 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $7.87 while solar wafer maker Canadian Solar retreated 73 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $12.81. The dollar slipped to 110.57 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro rose to $1.1246 from $1.1188. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Heating oil gave up 3 cents to $1.52 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 7 cents to $3.07 per 1,000 cubic feet. » Next page...

Banks fell hard as executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. An eight-day winning streak for technology companies ended. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drug makers, and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The New York Stock Exchange was evenly split between gainers and losers. "The stock market has been strong and all the while bond yields have dropped during the year," signalling caution about the economy, said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist for Northwestern Mutual Management. "In the next couple of months we're going to solve which is right: the bond market or the stock market." The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 1.11 points, or less than 0.1%, to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 20.82 points, or 0.1%, to 21,008.65. The Nasdaq composite fell 4.67 points, or 0.1%, to 6,198.52. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks slipped 0.99 points, or 0.1%, to 1,370.21. Banks skidded a day earlier as bond yields dropped, which hurts banks by forcing interest rates on loans lower. Yields were little changed, but financial firms fell again as investors worried that banks' revenue from trading stocks, bonds and currencies is going to weaken in the second quarter. At a financial industry conference in New York, Marianne Lake, JPMorgan Chase's chief financial officer, said JPMorgan's trading revenue is down about 15% this quarter because of a drop in fixed-income trading. She said that was because of low interest rates and remarkably low market volatility. "There is not a lot to trade around," she said. "People have cash but no conviction." At a different industry event on Wednesday, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said second-quarter trading revenue will fall 10% compared to a year ago. The banking industry had an outstanding first quarter, and trading was a key reason. JPMorgan Chase fell 1.75 US dollars, or 2.1%, to 82.15 dollars and Bank of America lost 43 cents, or 1.9%, to 22.41 dollars. Capital One slumped 1.36 dollars, or 1.7%, to 76.92 dollars and Goldman Sachs, which saw its vaunted trading business hit a speed bump in the first quarter, gave up 7.16 dollars, or 3.3%, to 211.26 dollars. Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note remained at 2.21%. Technology companies turned lower. The tech sector has reached its highest levels since the dot-com boom and companies like Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook have done far better than the rest of the market in 2017. Apple and Facebook are up 32% this year, and Alphabet is up 25%. All three slid on Wednesday. Pfizer rose 52 cents, or 1.6%, to 32.65 dollars and Irish drug maker Perrigo climbed 4,93 dollars, or 7.3%, to 72.85 dollars after its first-quarter report was better than expected. Health care products maker Johnson & Johnson advanced 1.14 dollars to 128.25 dollars. Benchmark US crude lost 1.34 dollars, or 2.7%, to 48.32 dollars a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, fell 1.53 dollars, or 3%, to 50.31 dollars a barrel in London. Energy stocks continued to decline. Exxon Mobil sank 60 cents to 80.50 dollars and Hess declined 78 cents, or 1.7%, to 45.89 dollars.

By WallaceWitkowski Reporter MarkDeCambre Editor’s note: Chicago-area economic activity rose to a 2½-year high in May. MNI Indicator earlier released an incorrect report on Chicago-area economic activity, representing a fall in May. The Chicago business barometer, or Chicago PMI, rose to 59.4 in May from 58.3. U.S. stocks closed lower on Wednesday, but off their worst levels of the session, notching gains for the month as a slump in bank shares and a mixed reading of economic reports weighed on investor sentiment. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.37% fell 1.11 points, or less than 0.1%, to close at 2,411.80, recovering from an earlier 9-point deficit, with only four of the market gauge’s 11 sectors closing lower. The financial sector finished down 0.8%, representing the worst performer, and energy shares closed down 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.29%  closed down 20.82 points, or 0.1%, at 21,008.65, with shares of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.51% and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -0.79% dragging blue chips firmly into the red with more than 2% losses. Combined, the pair of bank stocks contributed to the lion’s share of the Dow’s loss. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.94% after briefly touching an intraday high of 6,221.99, finished down 4.67 points, or less than 0.1%, at 6,198.52. For the month, the Nasdaq has been the best-performing among major indexes, up 2.5% in May, followed by a 1.2% gain for the S&P 500. Both indexes had their best monthly percentage gains since February. The Dow hung on to a meager gain of 0.3%. Financials took a hit because two of the largest U.S. banks signaled signs of a trading slowdown on the same day, said Ian Winer, head of the equities division at Wedbush Securities. Both J.P. Morgan Chase and Bank of America Corp. BAC, -0.80%  cautioned at an industry conferences on Wednesday that trading is weakening in the second quarter. Couple that with the drop in oil prices and reports that former FBI Director James Comey will publicly testify that President Donald Trump pushed him to end the probe into former national-security adviser Michael Flynn and you have a market that is going to sell off, Winer said. Energy shares continued their downtrend Wednesday with U.S. crude-oil prices CLN7, +1.24% dipping below $48 and settling down 2.7% at $48.32 a barrel. “Banks are being cautious and that has to make people a little nervous, and the market continues to plow money into the same names everyday,” said Winer, citing stocks like Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.08% Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +0.89% GOOGL, +0.79% Tesla Inc. TSLA, -0.15%  and Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -0.50% all of which are up 25% or more for the year. “I’m concerned that there are quantitative models out there that are ‘buy high, buy higher’ so you have this strange phenomenon feeding on itself where [those stocks] become a bigger part of the S&P 500,” he said. The benchmarks took a decided turn for the worse Wednesday after a reading for pending-home sales came in below expectations. Pending-home sales from the National Association of Realtors fell 1.3% to a level of 109.8 from a reduction in the March reading. Meanwhile, a gauge of economic health, the Chicago business barometer, or Chicago PMI, rose to 59.4 in May, its highest level in 2½ years. Earlier, reporting agency MNI Indicators had mistakenly said the gauge fell to 55.2. Any reading over 50 indicates improving conditions. Stocks pared gains slightly following the corrected PMI reading. The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book, or anecdotal report of regional conditions, said the economy is still growing at a “modest or moderate” pace, appearing to support a June rate increase. Even so, the market may be at a tipping point where a recent trend of soft data may support bearish views that economic growth doesn’t warrant two additional rate hikes by the Federal Reserve in 2017, said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. The Fed is widely expected to lift rates in June by a quarter point. “The question the market is grappling with is, is the Fed raising rates in an environment in which perhaps the economic data are weakening more than you should see for a rate-hike cycle?” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The Fed has been clear [in past policy statements] that weaker data are just noise and that we are moving toward a stronger economic backdrop but at this stage the dollar should rise; also, we see 10-year yields which haven’t moved higher,” she said. Indeed, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.44% hit a five-week low, dropping below 2.20% on Wednesday, while the dollar, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.03% a gauge of the buck against six rivals, traded lower for most of the day but was last up 0.1%. “People are looking for reasons to buy, but it doesn’t take a lot for markets to tumble back,” Cieszynski said. “I think some traders are starting to throw in the towel.” Need to know: Tech rally overdone?

Both JPMorgan and Bank of America have seen their share prices drop in early trading on Wednesday. JPMorgan was down about 1.8% and Bank of America was down about 3.3% as of 10:40 a.m. ET. The shares started to fall Wednesday morning following comments at an investor conference from executives of both firms. Markets revenue at JPMorgan is down 15% so far in the second quarter compared to last year, CFO Marianne Lake said, according to Reuters. Lake points to lower volatility this year, compared to the tumultuous situation surrounding Brexit in 2016. She added that U.S. economic growth is "solid, not stellar," which has contributed to JPMorgan's lower revenue. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan also said trading revenues would be lower in the second quarter compared to last year, according to Stephen Alpher of Seeking Alpha. Other banks are down as well. Goldman Sachs is down about 4%, Citigroup is down about 2.4% and Wells Fargo is down about 1.2% on Wednesday. The S&P 500 is down only 0.25%.

JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 percent decline in trading revenue in the current quarter compared with last year, while Bank of America said trading revenue in the second quarter was on track to be 10 to 12 percent lower than last year. Financials rallied more than 20 percent in the wake of the U.S. presidential election on hopes of fiscal stimulus and deregulation under President Donald Trump, but they have struggled in recent weeks. The sector is now down 0.3 percent on the year. "All the things that Trump told us were going to happen, which was infrastructure spend, deregulation, tax reform, people don't believe any of those will happen, certainly the magnitude and with the speed the market had originally priced in," said Ernesto Ramos, head of equities at BMO Global Asset Management in Chicago. "That is why you've seen a lot of the move back, specifically banks." Measures of market volatility are at rock-bottom, hitting trading desks at big banks. The U.S. stock market's main gauge of investor anxiety closed at its lowest level in over two decades on May 8 and has not topped its long-term average of 20 since November. It did, however, hit a seven-day high of 11.30 on Wednesday. JPMorgan shares lost 2.1 percent while Bank of America was down 1.9 percent as the two biggest weights on the S&P 500. Goldman Sachs fell 3.3 percent, the biggest drag on the Dow. Defensive plays such as utilities, up 0.46 percent and telecoms, up 0.35 percent, were the bright spots as enthusiasm fades for sectors that would benefit from Trump policies. Energy stocks, down 0.4 percent, also lost ground. Oil prices touched a three-week low as rising output from Nigeria and Libya fueled concerns that OPEC-led output cuts are being undermined. U.S. crude settled down 2.7 percent at $48.32 a barrel and Brent settled 3 percent lower at $50.1. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65, the S&P 500 lost 1.1 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,411.81 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.67 points, or 0.08 percent, to 6,198.52. Shares of Michael Kors plunged 8.5 percent to $33.18. The luxury fashion retailer gave a bleak full-year forecast and said it would shut more than 100 full-price retail stores in the next two years. Mallinckrodt closed down 1.2 percent at $43.13 after sources said the drugmaker is exploring a sale of its generic drug unit for as much as $2 billion. Analog Devices rose 1.1 percent to $85.76 after the chipmaker's quarterly results came in above expectations. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.01-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.04-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows. About 7.85 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 6.72 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.

Photos Videos Topics Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports Cricket Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education Health TRENDING# ICC Champions Trophy 2017 Cow Slaughter Kulbhushan Jadhav Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 News Education News US STOCKS-Wall St falls as financials stumble, oil drops Shares0 Thu, 1 Jun 2017-12:25am , Reuters U.S. stocks retreated on Wednesday, pulled lower by weakness in financials after JPMorgan and Bank of America warned of revenue weakness in the current quarter, while a drop in oil prices weighed on energy stocks. JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 percent decline in trading revenue compared with last year, while Bank of America said trading revenue in the second quarter was on track to be 10 to 12 percent lower than last year. Financials rallied more than 20 percent in the wake of the U.S. presidential election on hopes of fiscal stimulus and deregulation under President Donald Trump but have struggled in recent weeks. The sector is now down 0.8 percent on the year. "It is just investors' confidence in the Trump policies is waning, it continues to wane," said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. Measures of market volatility are at rock-bottom, hitting trading desks at big banks. The U.S. stock market's main gauge of investor anxiety closed at its lowest level in over two decades on May 8 and has not topped its long-term average of 20 since November. It did, however, hit a seven-day high of 11.18 on Wednesday. JPMorgan shares lost 2.4 percent while Goldman Sachs fell 3.4 percent and was the biggest drag on the Dow. Bank of America was down 2.7 percent. Adding to the pressure, oil prices touched a three week low as rising Libyan production fueled concerns that OPEC-led output cuts are being undermined by several countries that are excluded from the deal.

JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 percent decline in trading revenue compared with last year, while Bank of America said trading revenue in the second quarter was on track to be 10 to 12 percent lower than last year. Financials rallied more than 20 percent in the wake of the U.S. presidential election on hopes of fiscal stimulus and deregulation under President Donald Trump but have struggled in recent weeks. The sector is now down 0.8 percent on the year. "It is just investors' confidence in the Trump policies is waning, it continues to wane," said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York. Measures of market volatility are at rock-bottom, hitting trading desks at big banks. The U.S. stock market's main gauge of investor anxiety closed at its lowest level in over two decades on May 8 and has not topped its long-term average of 20 since November. It did, however, hit a seven-day high of 11.18 on Wednesday. JPMorgan shares lost 2.4 percent while Goldman Sachs fell 3.4 percent and was the biggest drag on the Dow. Bank of America was down 2.7 percent. Adding to the pressure, oil prices touched a three week low as rising Libyan production fueled concerns that OPEC-led output cuts are being undermined by several countries that are excluded from the deal. U.S. crude lost 2.9 percent at $48.21 a barrel and Brent was off 3.1 percent at $50.63. Defensive plays such as utilities, up 0.6 percent and telecoms, up 0.5 percent, were the bright spots. "It´s just more of an instance where the market is getting a little bit skittish," said Bell. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 36.91 points, or 0.18 percent, to 20,992.56, the S&amp;P 500 lost 4.86 points, or 0.20 percent, to 2,408.05 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 21.02 points, or 0.34 percent, to 6,182.17.

The U.S. stock market's main gauge of investor anxiety closed at its lowest level in over two decades on May 8."There is a choppy sideways market due to the fact that fundamentals are largely unchanged and expectations of market friendly policies in the U.S. are being pushed to 2018," said Stephen Wood, chief market strategist, North America, Russell Investments.Financials, which have largely outperformed the broader market on bets of fiscal stimulus and simpler banking regulations under President Donald Trump, are on track to decline 0.7 percent so far this year. JPMorgan was down 2 percent on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs fell 3 percent and was the biggest drag on the Dow.

JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for the decline in trading revenue, while Bank of America said trading revenue in the second quarter was on track to be 10-12 percent lower than last year.

The Reuters photo shows traders working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. NEW YORK: US stocks were down on Wednesday as financial stocks fell after JPMorgan and Bank of America hinted at revenue weakness in the current quarter. JPMorgan chief financial officer Marianne Lake said the decline stemmed from lower volatility compared with a year ago when the United Kingdom was preparing to vote on Brexit. Bank of America chief executive Brian Moynihan said second-quarter earnings would be hurt by a drop in trading revenue, lower-than-expected interest rates and the sale or shuttering of certain assets. “There is a choppy sideways market due to the fact that fundamentals are largely unchanged and expectations of market friendly policies in the US are being pushed to 2018,” said Stephen Wood, chief market strategist, North America, Russell Investments. Seven of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the financial index’s 1.3% fall leading the decliners. Financials, which have largely outperformed the broader market on bets of fiscal stimulus and simpler banking regulations under President Trump, are on track to decline 0.7% so far this year. JPMorgan was down 2% on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs fell 3% and was the biggest drag on the Dow. Bank of America was down 2.2%. At 10:40am EDT, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 46.17 points, or 0.22%, at 20,983.3, the S&P 500 was down 5.15 points, or 0.21%, at 2,407.76 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 27.40 points, or 0.44%, at 6,175.79. The Federal Reserve issues its Beige Book at 2pm ET (1800 GMT), a compendium of anecdotes on the health of the economy, that will likely provide further evidence that the economy continues to strengthen giving the Federal Reserve impetus to raise rate next month. Traders currently see an 86.6% chance of a quarter-point rate hike at the Fed’s June meeting, according to Thomson Reuters data. Shares of Michael Kors fell 9.4% to US$32.88 after the luxury fashion retailer gave a bleak full-year forecast and said it would shut more than 100 full-price retail stores in the next two years. Mallinckrodt was down 1.1% at US$43.12, after sources said the drugmaker is exploring a sale of its generic drug unit, in a deal that could fetch as much as US$2bil. Analog Devices rose 3.9% to US$88.06 after the chipmaker’s quarterly results came in above expectations. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,816 to 928, for a 1.96-to-1 ratio on the downside. On the Nasdaq, 1,842 issues fell and 771 advanced for a 2.39-to-1 ratio favoring decliners. The S&P 500 index showed 28 new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 82 new highs and 70 new lows. - Reuters   Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Stocks , Wall Street Related Stories Related Stories Wall St at record levels despite tepid jobs report Wall St opens higher after strong private jobs data Wall St opens slightly lower as investors digest data Wall St in holiday mode ahead of long weekend (Update 1) Wall St flat ahead of long weekend You May Be Interested DRealty working towards solving liabilities issue The need to educate investors on ponzi and pyramid scheme Samsung Galaxy Tab S3: Sleek and stylish 5 superpowers every mum has 6 beautiful cities to add to your bucket list How to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Others Also Read Memorial form comes too late for Lahiri Call for Govt to help people use water efficiently Visitors trash and steal exhibits at students’ art show – again Property Related advertisement Latest News A decent quarter with mixed results for banking sector Net foreign buying on Bursa crosses key RM10b Maybank IB feels the O&G sector has bottomed out Ringgit firmer vs US$, pound sterling early Monday KLCI wavers early Monday, key Asian markets mixed Most Viewed in Business Ringgit firmer vs US$, pound sterling early Monday Higher revenue for IRB Net foreign buying on Bursa crosses key RM10b Ng to take AIA to the next stage of growth A decent quarter with mixed results for banking sector Maybank IB feels the O&G sector has bottomed out Five golden rules for investing borrowed money Chinese billionaires clash over Alibaba’s parcel deliveries Affin Hwang Research sees Malaysian stock market in early stage rally My money mistakes advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

The major averages edged lower in Tuesday's stock market trading, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite snapping seven-day winning streaks. Several big-cap tech giants hit fresh all-time highs, but bank stocks were among the notable losers, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC). Citigroup (C) also edged lower, but remains in relatively sound shape. XAutoplay: On | OffDow industrials futures rose a fraction above fair value, S&P 500 futures also edged up while Nasdaq 100 futures rose more than 0.1%. U.S. crude oil futures fell nearly 2% to below $49 a barrel amid renewed oversupply concerns. Bank stocks were big leaders of the so-called Trump rally following the presidential election. But the stocks have struggled for several months. Here are four reasons to look beyond the banks to other sectors. Stock Charts Weak Dow industrials component JPMorgan Chase narrowly avoided undercutting the low of its base Tuesday, setting a four-month closing low. JPMorgan Chase, fellow Dow stock Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are all below their downwardly sloping 50-day moving averages, with Wells Fargo (WFC) under its 200-day for good measure. Relative strength lines, which track how stocks perform vs. the S&P 500, highlight how financials have lagged in 2017. JPMorgan's RS line has fallen to its lowest levels since Election Day, with other banks' RS lines showing similar weakness. Citigroup is an exception. Citi is just below a 62.63 buy point in a flat base, and is still in range from an aggressive entry at 60.89. Citi's RS line isn't great but has risen fractionally over the past four months. IBD'S TAKE: Every day the market is full of noise. So what should you focus on? IBD's Investing Action Plan highlights top earnings reports, stock near entries and key economic data for the coming day. In the latest action play, we highlight three stocks in buy range with earnings due Wednesday. Tax Cuts Sidelined A big reason why bank stocks, and the overall market, rallied on Trump's election was the prospect of tax cuts and other pro-growth measures. But Trump has been embroiled in troubles, distracting the White House and sapping his political capital. Republicans are divided on key issues, including how much to cut and how to offset the lost revenue, if at all. Wall Street appears to be pricing-out prospects for major tax reform, at least in 2017. Bank executives, and perhaps investors, are still hopeful that the Trump administration will ease financial regulatory burdens that limit lending and buybacks. Yield Curve Stronger economic growth should spur demand for loans, but it also should encourage higher interest rates and wider spreads between banks' short-term funding costs and long-term lending rates. Yield spreads widened after the election. But with the Federal Reserve raising short-term official rates and the 10-year Treasury yield sliding toward 2017 lows, the yield curve is the flattest in seven months. That's bad news for banks' net interest margins and not a great sign for the economy either. Long-Term Performance Bank stocks are going through a lull right now. Perhaps they'll turn around soon. But looking at long-term charts, bank stocks haven't really outperformed the S&P 500 for long stretches, even well-run operations such as JPMorgan. Bank stocks have had short-term outperformance, such as in last few months of 2016, but banks are not secular market leaders. If investors want to follow the market, buying a broad index mutual fund or ETF (with banks a significant part of the holdings) can do that without the sector risk. Overseas Trading Japan's Nikkei fell 0.1%. China's Shanghai composite, which had been closed on Tuesday, rose 0.2% after climbing much more earlier on a report indicating steady manufacturing growth. In Europe, the U.K.'s FTSE climbed 0.3% intraday, Germany's Dax 0.2% and France's CAC-40 edged higher.

But the company's ability to do high volume, value-added manufacturing at a reasonable cost may cushion it from any potential slowdown in demand for iPhones in the long term, a JPMorgan analyst told CNBC. It is expected to assemble the bulk of Apple's newest smartphones due later this year, and may benefit from a supercycle. "Hon Hai, at the end of the day, is a process company," said Gokul Hariharan, Asia tech analyst and head of Taiwan equity research at JPMorgan. "If you look at the history of Hon Hai over the last 20 years, product cycle has not really mattered as much." Sean Gallup | Getty Images He explained the company has always tried to run a vertically integrated business model, where it started with connectors and other components business before going into assembly in mid-to-late 90s. First Hon Hai assembled desktops when they were still the main tech product; then it moved into game consoles, feature phones with Motorola and Nokia, and music players for Apple before moving onto smartphones. "So all along, the skill set they're providing is high volume manufacturing at a very reasonable cost and very strong execution," Hariharan said, adding the manufacturer also brings in a fair bit of technology elements into its offering. "Which is why it feels like it may not be very directly linked to product cycles in the long term." Along the way, Hon Hai added some components businesses to their operations in an attempt to maximize the value, in terms of dollar content, within any product they assemble, according to Hariharan. Last year's acquisition of troubled Japanese electronics maker Sharp meant Hon Hai now had access to two major components of a smartphone: camera modules and display. These two functionalities are usually expected to be upgraded by smartphone vendors, even when other features of handsets may remain the same. "If you look at most tech products, display is typically one of the largest cost items in terms of components," Hariharan said. Japanese business daily Nikkei reported in January that Hon Hai and Sharp were mulling over building a factory in China — where the iPhones are assembled — to make OLED display panels. The proximity could theoretically reduce components cost for making the iPhone. The next generation of iPhones are expected to come with OLED display and currently Samsung Display will provide the bulk of these panels for Apple. show chapters Cramer: iPhone 8 cycle will be a big one    Monday, 22 May 2017 | 9:16 AM ET | 01:49 Reuters reported that Hon Hai and Sharp have teamed up to bid for Toshiba's prized memory chip business. Hariharan said a potential move into the semiconductor business was underpinned by the fact that Hon Hai made close to 20 to 25 percent in revenue from enterprise and cloud; the company assembles servers, storage elements and switches for tech companies and enterprise is a big driver for NAND flash, he added. The other two major contract electronics manufacturers that assemble iPhones — Pegatron and Wistron — also remain exposed to Apple, at least in the short term. Wistron is a latecomer to the assembly equation and handles mostly the older iPhones. Hariharan said JPMorgan has a conservative view on Wistron because the company is still making the transition from producing lower-end handsets to the most advanced; it needs to build up capacity to handle the high volume seen in the first quarter of new iPhone launches, where Apple can sell more than 10 million units on the opening weekend. "If you're not a vendor who is able to support that volume ramp in that period, then you never get peak volume for your capacity," he said. Meanwhile, some of Apple's more specialized suppliers — who provide components such as camera modules — remain well-hedged in their business because they serve the global smartphone market — meaning, they were also selling into other smartphone brands. For example Samsung or SK Hynix supply memory to majority of the smartphone brands. "They don't have the same level of cyclicality," said Hariharan, but they don't enjoy the same benefits from a surge in demand for iPhones. "They won't have the same upside when you have a very strong iPhone cycle, in terms of their revenues and profits." show chapters Apple, Samsung lose market share to Chinese phone makers    Tuesday, 23 May 2017 | 4:25 PM ET | 01:03 For the moment, Hariharan expects the dynamics between Apple and its suppliers to remain in the short term: this means iPhone assemblers like Hon Hai, Pegatron and Wistron will stay exposed to the iPhone product cycle and their revenues will swing accordingly. But in the longer term, if smartphones are replaced by something bigger, Hariharan said a company with a vertically integrated business model such as Hon Hai could be the partner of choice to assemble it. JPMorgan's price target for Hon Hai by year-end is NT$112 ($3.72). On Wednesday morning at 10:40 a.m. HK/SIN, Hon Hai shares traded at NT$104.

CNBC Here's how much we've spent in Apple's App Store Apple today revealed how much developers have earned through the App Store, and from this figure we can glean just how much users have spent on apps over the years. Apple announced developers have earned over $70 billion since the App Store went live in 2008. Taking the tech giant's 70/30 revenue split into account, that means customers have spent over $100 billion in App Store purchases. Apple didn't stop with an earnings number boast as it also revealed App Store downloads grew by over 70% in the past 12 months, and active paid subscriptions are up 58% since the same time last year.

The Nasdaq gained 0.78 percent, also posting a record high. The S&P 500 rose 0.76 percent to an all-time high, with materials and health care leading advancers. The health care sector reached its first 52-week high since March 15. Economists polled by Reuters expect the U.S. economy to have added 185,000 jobs last month. But David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, said expectations may have increased in the market after a strong report from ADP and Moody's Analytics. The Thursday report said private payrolls surged by 253,000 in May, easily topping a consensus estimate of 185,000. "It was a very good, positive surprise. We've had a few negative surprises, so this is definitely against the current," said JPMorgan Funds' Kelly. "Overall, it says the economy is still moving along nicely." The report from ADP and Moody's is often seen as a preview to the U.S. government's nonfarm payrolls report, which is set for release Friday at 8:30 a.m.  Wall Street had a slew of data to digest Thursday, including weekly jobless claims, which came in at 248,000, above a forecast of 239,000. The ISM manufacturing index for May came in at 54.9, just below an estimate of 55.0. April construction spending fell 1.4 percent with economists forecasting a gain of 0.5 percent. Auto companies, meanwhile, released monthly vehicle sales throughout the day. Load Error The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq are coming off solid monthly performances in May. S&P and Nasdaq posted monthly gains of 1.16 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, while the Dow rose about a third of a percent on the back of a subdued volatility environment. The CBOE Volatility Index broke below 10 six times last month, hitting levels not seen in more than 20 years. "Investors worry that the relationship between decreasing volatility and increased purchases could morph from a virtuous cycle to self-fulfilling feedback frenzy, leading to a vicious, volatility induced selloff," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. "The extent of a potential downdraft depends on how large the risk-parity investment community is. It's widely believed that the mass of money managed under a risk-parity mandate remains small, although it's a trend worth watching," Ablin said in a note. Tech stocks were among the best performers as the sector continued to build on its stellar year-to-date gains. Tech has gained nearly 20 percent in 2017. By comparison, consumer discretionary, the second-best-performing sector, is up 12 percent. "Most of the growth has come from large-cap growth stocks," said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt. "It's still a momentum-driven market that's skeptical about cyclical land." In corporate news, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise slipped more than 5 percent after the firm reported a significant decline in quarterly sales.

About Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. Healthcare Trust of America, Inc. is the largest dedicated owner and operator of medical office buildings in the United States, based on gross leasable area ("GLA"). We provide the real estate infrastructure for the integrated delivery of healthcare services in highly desirable locations. Over the last decade through March 31, 2017, we have invested $4.3 billion primarily in medical office buildings and other healthcare assets comprising 17.8 million square feet of GLA. Our investments are targeted in 15 to 20 key markets that we believe have superior healthcare demographics that support strong, long-term demand for medical office space. We have achieved, and continue to achieve, critical mass within these key markets by expanding our presence through accretive acquisitions, and utilizing our in-house operating expertise through our regionally located property management and leasing platform. Founded in 2006 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 2012, HTA has produced attractive returns for its stockholders that we believe have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 and US REIT indices. Forward-Looking Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of the Company and the Duke Acquisition as described in this press release. These forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as "expects," "plans," "estimates," "anticipates," "projects," "intends," "believes," "outlook," and similar expressions that do not relate to historical matters, are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions which may not be realized and involve risks and uncertainties, many of which cannot be predicted with accuracy and some of which might not even be anticipated, that could cause actual outcomes and results, financial and otherwise, to differ materially, including statements related to the closing of the Duke Acquisition. Risks and other factors related to the Company that might cause such differences include, among others, the following: we may abandon development or redevelopment opportunities for which we have already incurred costs; adverse capital market conditions may affect our access to various sources of capital and/or cost of capital, which may affect our business activities, earnings and common stock price, among other things; we may not be able to effectively deploy the net proceeds of offerings of securities; changes in economic conditions affecting the healthcare property sector, the commercial real estate market and the credit market may affect our performance and financial condition; competition for acquisition of medical office buildings and other facilities that serve the healthcare industry could increase; economic fluctuations in certain states in which our property investments are geographically concentrated could affect our results of operations; and we may not be able to retain our senior management team. Any forward-looking statements or forecasts relating to the business, prospects, operating statistics or financial results relating to the Duke Acquisition are based on assumptions and are inherently speculative, are subject to substantial uncertainty, and the actual operating statistics and financial results may differ materially from the Company's forecasts. Risks and other factors related to the Duke Acquisition that might cause such differences include, among other things, the following: we may not be able to consummate the Duke Acquisition on time or on the terms currently expected or at all; we may not be able to effectively integrate the assets acquired in the Duke Acquisition into our portfolio and/or we may fail to achieve expected efficiencies and synergies; our assumptions concerning the availability and/or terms of financing related to the Duke Acquisition may not be realized; we may encounter liabilities for which we are responsible that were unknown at the time we agreed to the Duke Acquisition; and our assumptions concerning risks relating to our lack of control of joint ventures may prove incorrect. In addition, the Company's forecasts are subject to a variety of additional factors and risks, including the risks set forth under "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's Form 10-K, and in the Company's other periodic and Form 8-K filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Changing the Face of Technology Through Diversity & Inclusion: A Top Priority for Organizations Working to Support Entrepreneurship LOS ANGELES, June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Organizations focused on women and minority entrepreneurs gathered in Los Angeles at the La Kretz Innovation Campus to discuss strategies to increase support, access to capital, job creation and a more inclusive environment for diverse entrepreneurs in the tech industry. In partnership with The Association for Enterprise Opportunity (AEO) and sponsored by JPMorgan Chase & Co, Taking the Lead: Growing Women and Minority Entrepreneurship in America featured a panel of experts highlighting strategies for diverse entrepreneurs to enter the tech ecosystem, including initiatives underway through the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI). Maria Contreras-Sweet, a member of President Obama’s Cabinet and the 24th Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), was honored at the event for her dedication to enforcing the need for diversity in small business and helping to launch LACI’s Diversity & Inclusion initiatives. Under Contreras-Sweet’s leadership, SBA loans to women rose 42% and loans to minorities increased 36%, a momentum in critical need of being upheld. The award was presented by LACI Chief Operating Officer, Neal Anderson. Taking the Lead: Growing Women and Minority Entrepreneurship in America- Back row (L-R): Eileen Sanchez, Economic Director LA Mayor’s Office, former U.S. SBA Head of International; Jessie Draper, Founding Partner, Halogen Ventures; Daniel Tellalian, Managing Partner, Avivar Capital; Sky Kelley, Founder and CEO, Avisare, an LACI portfolio company; Neal Anderson, LACI Chief Operating Officer. Front row: Judy Hackett, SVP, Dun & Bradstreet; Connie Evans, President and CEO, Association for… The Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI) „There is a powerful economic opportunity to seize by taking steps to be intentionally focused on inclusive entrepreneurship,” said Connie Evans, President and CEO of the Association for Enterprise Opportunity. „Our latest report, The Tapestry of Black Business Ownership in America: Untapped Opportunities for Success, points out the need to reduce barriers faced by Blacks and other diverse groups by transitioning from their concentration in low-revenue growth industry sectors to higher performing sectors, such as tech. Doing so will require greater access to capital but also greater access to training programs and the funding that makes that possible.” The program included strategies to bring a more diverse pipeline of entrepreneurs into LACI and the technology industry more broadly. A panel of experts representing financial services, entrepreneurship and investment capital shared insights to supporting these entrepreneurs. Moderated by Anousha Sakoui of Bloomberg, panelists included: JPMorgan Chase co-sponsored the event as part of its three-year $75 million Small Business Forward program, a global effort to support women-, minority- and veteran-owned small businesses. „We are delighted to partner with LACI and other community leaders in this effort to bring much needed diversity into the cleantech sector,” said Joseph Skowera, Chase Business Banking Market Manager for Los Angeles. „Given the diverse population of Los Angeles and the large number of women and minority-owned businesses in the region, we are optimistic that the tech sector here can attract more of these business owners.” Each year, Silicon Valley companies report their diversity employment numbers with minimal progress occurring in the industry. Los Angeles’ competitive advantage, in both cleantech and cultural diversity, presents unique opportunities to lead the way in changing the face of technology. „Los Angeles is where the world creates and innovates,” said Tracy Gray, Chair of the LACI Diversity in Entrepreneurship Advisory Council and Managing Partner/Founder of The 22 Capital Group. „Our goal is to change the face of tech through a conscious effort to recruit and support diverse entrepreneurs and make the industry look more like the diversity of Los Angeles and less like Silicon Valley.” Several tech hubs in the U.S. continue to see incredible trajectories of success, but women and minority entrepreneurs are being left behind. Racially, ethnically, and gender diverse firms financially outperform the industry norms (these firms are 15-35% more likely to have higher financial returns). By being intentional with new and inclusive initiatives, more communities in the U.S. can participate and benefit directly through jobs created by diverse entrepreneurs. The LACI Diversity in Entrepreneurship Advisory Council was launched earlier this year, consisting of experienced and diverse leaders from business, government, academia and community organizations helping to design programming to best serve the region’s underrepresented populations and expand this nationally. The Advisory Council includes representatives from The 22 Capital Group, Avivar Capital, Environmental Defense Fund, Federal Chief Sustainability Office, JPMorgan Chase & Co, LA 2024, LA Coalition for the Economy & Jobs, Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, Los Angeles Department of Transportation, Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, REDF, SKY Marketing, The City of Los Angeles, and LACI portfolio companies, Avisare and GRID Logistics. About The Association for Enterprise Opportunity (AEO) The Association for Enterprise Opportunity (AEO) is the leading voice of innovation in microfinance and microbusiness in the United States. For twenty-six years, AEO and its more than 450 member organizations have helped millions of entrepreneurs contribute to economic growth while supporting themselves, their families and their communities.

Together with our partners and members, we work to change the way capital and services flow to underserved entrepreneurs so that they can create jobs and opportunities for all. About The Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI) The Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI) is a private non-profit organization helping to accelerate the commercialization of clean technologies by offering flexible office space, CEO coaching, mentoring, and access to a robust network of partnerships and capital. LACI was founded in 2011 as a cluster-driven economic development initiative supported by the City of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power and the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles. Recognized as one of the most innovative business incubators in the world by UBI, LACI identifies local entrepreneurs across multiple cleantech business sectors and guides them to market, creating jobs that advance LA’s green economy. In just five years, LACI has helped 67 companies raise $134M in funding, created 1,500 jobs, and delivered more than $335M in long term economic value for the City of Los Angeles.

PERELMAN HEART INSTITUTE LAUNCH #HandsOnlyCPR CAMPAIGN WITH A SIMPLE MESSAGE: EVERYONE CAN SAVE A LIFE Posted on 1 June 2017 by Maciej Heyman Changing the Face of Technology Through Diversity & Inclusion: A Top Priority for Organizations Working to Support Entrepreneurship LOS ANGELES, June 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Organizations focused on women and minority entrepreneurs gathered in Los Angeles at the La Kretz Innovation Campus to discuss strategies to increase support, access to capital, job creation and a more inclusive environment for diverse entrepreneurs in the tech industry. In partnership with The Association for Enterprise Opportunity (AEO) and sponsored by JPMorgan Chase & Co, Taking the Lead: Growing Women and Minority Entrepreneurship in America featured a panel of experts highlighting strategies for diverse entrepreneurs to enter the tech ecosystem, including initiatives underway through the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI). Maria Contreras-Sweet, a member of President Obama’s Cabinet and the 24th Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), was honored at the event for her dedication to enforcing the need for diversity in small business and helping to launch LACI’s Diversity & Inclusion initiatives. Under Contreras-Sweet’s leadership, SBA loans to women rose 42% and loans to minorities increased 36%, a momentum in critical need of being upheld. The award was presented by LACI Chief Operating Officer, Neal Anderson. Taking the Lead: Growing Women and Minority Entrepreneurship in America- Back row (L-R): Eileen Sanchez, Economic Director LA Mayor’s Office, former U.S. SBA Head of International; Jessie Draper, Founding Partner, Halogen Ventures; Daniel Tellalian, Managing Partner, Avivar Capital; Sky Kelley, Founder and CEO, Avisare, an LACI portfolio company; Neal Anderson, LACI Chief Operating Officer. Front row: Judy Hackett, SVP, Dun & Bradstreet; Connie Evans, President and CEO, Association for… The Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator (LACI) „There is a powerful economic opportunity to seize by taking steps to be intentionally focused on inclusive entrepreneurship,” said Connie Evans, President and CEO of the Association for Enterprise Opportunity. „Our latest report, The Tapestry of Black Business Ownership in America: Untapped Opportunities for Success, points out the need to reduce barriers faced by Blacks and other diverse groups by transitioning from their concentration in low-revenue growth industry sectors to higher performing sectors, such as tech. Doing so will require greater access to capital but also greater access to training programs and the funding that makes that possible.” The program included strategies to bring a more diverse pipeline of entrepreneurs into LACI and the technology industry more broadly. A panel of experts representing financial services, entrepreneurship and investment capital shared insights to supporting these entrepreneurs. Moderated by Anousha Sakoui of Bloomberg, panelists included: JPMorgan Chase co-sponsored the event as part of its three-year $75 million Small Business Forward program, a global effort to support women-, minority- and veteran-owned small businesses. „We are delighted to partner with LACI and other community leaders in this effort to bring much needed diversity into the cleantech sector,” said Joseph Skowera, Chase Business Banking Market Manager for Los Angeles. „Given the diverse population of Los Angeles and the large number of women and minority-owned businesses in the region, we are optimistic that the tech sector here can attract more of these business owners.” Each year, Silicon Valley companies report their diversity employment numbers with minimal progress occurring in the industry. Los Angeles’ competitive advantage, in both cleantech and cultural diversity, presents unique opportunities to lead the way in changing the face of technology. „Los Angeles is where the world creates and innovates,” said Tracy Gray, Chair of the LACI Diversity in Entrepreneurship Advisory Council and Managing Partner/Founder of The 22 Capital Group. „Our goal is to change the face of tech through a conscious effort to recruit and support diverse entrepreneurs and make the industry look more like the diversity of Los Angeles and less like Silicon Valley.” Several tech hubs in the U.S. continue to see incredible trajectories of success, but women and minority entrepreneurs are being left behind. Racially, ethnically, and gender diverse firms financially outperform the industry norms (these firms are 15-35% more likely to have higher financial returns). By being intentional with new and inclusive initiatives, more communities in the U.S. can participate and benefit directly through jobs created by diverse entrepreneurs. The LACI Diversity in Entrepreneurship Advisory Council was launched earlier this year, consisting of experienced and diverse leaders from business, government, academia and community organizations helping to design programming to best serve the region’s underrepresented populations and expand this nationally. The Advisory Council includes representatives from The 22 Capital Group, Avivar Capital, Environmental Defense Fund, Federal Chief Sustainability Office, JPMorgan Chase & Co, LA 2024, LA Coalition for the Economy & Jobs, Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, Los Angeles Department of Transportation, Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, REDF, SKY Marketing, The City of Los Angeles, and LACI portfolio companies, Avisare and GRID Logistics.

Moderated by Anousha Sakoui of Bloomberg, panelists included: JPMorgan Chase co-sponsored the event as part of its three-year $75 million Small Business Forward program, a global effort to support women-, minority- and veteran-owned small businesses. „We are delighted to partner with LACI and other community leaders in this effort to bring much needed diversity into the cleantech sector,” said Joseph Skowera, Chase Business Banking Market Manager for Los Angeles. „Given the diverse population of Los Angeles and the large number of women and minority-owned businesses in the region, we are optimistic that the tech sector here can attract more of these business owners.” Each year, Silicon Valley companies report their diversity employment numbers with minimal progress occurring in the industry. Los Angeles’ competitive advantage, in both cleantech and cultural diversity, presents unique opportunities to lead the way in changing the face of technology. „Los Angeles is where the world creates and innovates,” said Tracy Gray, Chair of the LACI Diversity in Entrepreneurship Advisory Council and Managing Partner/Founder of The 22 Capital Group. „Our goal is to change the face of tech through a conscious effort to recruit and support diverse entrepreneurs and make the industry look more like the diversity of Los Angeles and less like Silicon Valley.” Several tech hubs in the U.S. continue to see incredible trajectories of success, but women and minority entrepreneurs are being left behind. Racially, ethnically, and gender diverse firms financially outperform the industry norms (these firms are 15-35% more likely to have higher financial returns). By being intentional with new and inclusive initiatives, more communities in the U.S. can participate and benefit directly through jobs created by diverse entrepreneurs. The LACI Diversity in Entrepreneurship Advisory Council was launched earlier this year, consisting of experienced and diverse leaders from business, government, academia and community organizations helping to design programming to best serve the region’s underrepresented populations and expand this nationally. The Advisory Council includes representatives from The 22 Capital Group, Avivar Capital, Environmental Defense Fund, Federal Chief Sustainability Office, JPMorgan Chase & Co, LA 2024, LA Coalition for the Economy & Jobs, Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, Los Angeles Department of Transportation, Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, REDF, SKY Marketing, The City of Los Angeles, and LACI portfolio companies, Avisare and GRID Logistics.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon Many crises could’ve erupted in the world during the second quarter, and then didn’t. That’s not necessarily good for Wall Street banks. Top executives at JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are lamenting that there’s too little happening in the world to spur investors to buy and sell. Yet at the same time, there’s just enough uncertainty over geopolitics and U.S. tax reform to restrain corporate mergers and acquisitions. Remarks from those three banks’ leaders signal that almost a year of geopolitical turmoil that began with the U.K.’s surprise vote to exit the European Union, and then escalated with Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election, may be cooling. Wall Street had gorged as customers adjusted to every shock. Now it seems many are inured: Trump’s early morning tweets aren’t enough to keep trading desks buzzing. “Volatility hasn’t been that great actually — it’s made for a very tough slog,” Eric Wasserstrom, a banking analyst at Guggenheim Securities, said Wednesday on Bloomberg Television. Still, “I don’t know if we really want to be rooting for political dislocation as something that really helps the investment banking community.” At JPMorgan, markets revenue tumbled about 15 percent in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a fixed-income slump, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told investors in New York on Wednesday morning. At Bank of America, revenue from the business will be 10 percent to 12 percent lower, Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said at another event that day. At Goldman, clients’ trading remains “subdued,” co-President David Solomon said. “There haven’t been that many idiosyncratic events, and we need a few more of them,” Lake said. “As a sweeping generalization, low rates, a more cautious outlook on rates, and low volatility have led to low client flows and a generally quiet, subdued and challenging trading environment.” Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman indicated his firm is seeing similar trading declines. The estimates from JPMorgan and Bank of America “are reflecting reality and I don’t think we’re very different,” Gorman said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Beijing on Thursday. A lot hasn’t happened this quarter. Centrist Emmanuel Macron prevailed in France’s presidential election last month, heading off euro-skeptic Marine Le Pen and taking pressure off the currency bloc. Trump struggled to score major legislative victories. And while tensions escalated between the U.S. and North Korea, they didn’t veer into open warfare. Still, the trading doldrums described by bank executives on Wednesday caught their shareholders off guard. Goldman Sachs’s stock fell hardest, dropping 3.3 percent to the lowest since November, leading a decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Bank of America and JPMorgan both slid more than 2 percent. Investors were aware that volatility was muted but were expecting trading revenues to fall only about 5 percent from the year-earlier period, Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a phone interview. “There’s just been no event this quarter” comparable with last year’s, such as Brexit, he said. The Federal Reserve’s meeting in June could provide fodder for bank clients, Cassidy said. Traders are expecting the Fed to outline how and when it plans to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. And futures prices indicate an 88 percent chance the Fed is poised to raise rates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. If either of those don’t go according to expectations, banks could jump on the opportunity to trade. In the first quarter, profits at several of the biggest U.S. banks trounced estimates, fueled by revenue from fixed-income sales and trading. Altogether, the five biggest U.S. banks took in 51 percent more from debt underwriting than a year earlier, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Fresh debts typically help spur trading in the secondary market. This quarter, new debt issuance has waned or stagnated in almost every major market. U.S. investment-grade bond underwriting declined 6.7 percent, European deals dropped 18 percent, and emerging-market bonds were flat through May 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Even new loans — typically more desirable for investors when rates are rising because the interest they charge can adjust — declined globally by 28 percent, the data show. Equities trading — a business that’s been transforming into a lower-fee, largely electronic market — may hold up for banks this quarter even after the CBOE Volatility Index for the S&P 500 neared a record low in May. In Europe, revenue from cash equities is on pace to rise 18 percent from the first quarter, while dropping “slightly” in the U.S., JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein wrote in a note to clients May 23. Still, revenue from stock derivatives will decline across regions, he said. JPMorgan’s Lake listed equities, especially corporate derivatives and prime brokerage, as an source of strength for the period. When it comes to mergers and acquisitions, uncertainties over European elections and U.S. tax reform have led companies to exercise caution, Solomon said. That’s despite steady growth and a competitive environment that encourages CEOs to act. As a result, Solomon said he expects a “reasonable pace” for deals. Gorman called the confluence of economic growth and political turmoil a “conundrum” for markets. “There is enormous uncertainty, which typically would breed tremendous volatility, and it’s not,” Gorman said. “It’s this very passive perspective that investors have, and I think the downside risk at this point is outweighing the upside risk.” Even if turmoil — and thus trading — revives, the reward for many employees may be limited. Executives said they’re trying hard to keep a lid on costs. Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Marty Chavez put it like this alongside Solomon: “As revenue growth occurs, you should expect comp growth to lag.” Bloomberg’s Jenny Surane contributed.

The arrangement takes effect Jan. 1, Hilton said Thursday in a statement that didn’t disclose terms. AmEx shares had struggled after the company lost out to Citigroup in a bidding war for Costco Wholesale Corp.’s card portfolio and failed to renew its partnership with JetBlue Airways Corp. in 2015. The lender also has been buffeted by intensifying competition for its wealthy clients, prompting Chief Executive Officer Ken Chenault to shuffle top managers, boost spending on marketing and sweeten rewards to keep customers. Read more: Buffett says AmEx is up to the challenge from JPMorgan “This announcement is clearly positive for American Express as this breaks a string of defections,” Sanjay Sakhrani, a KBW analyst, said in a note to clients. “It also potentially signals a peak in the competitive intensity of these deals.” American Express climbed 0.7 percent to $77.46 at 11:29 a.m. in New York. The shares have gained 4.5 percent this year, compared with the 0.3 percent decline of the 65-company S&P 500 Financials Index. AmEx’s Starwood Preferred Guest card, which accounts for about 4 percent of the company’s loans and 2 percent of total spending, is at risk after Marriott International Inc.’s takeover of rival Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide. Marriott has a co-brand deal with JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest U.S. credit-card lender, and Visa Inc., the world’s biggest payments network. Co-Brand Pressure The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up AmEx winning the Hilton portfolio takes some of the sting out of losing its agreement with Costco, a much bigger partnership that accounted for 20 percent of worldwide loans and 8 percent of card spending. The largest U.S. warehouse chain decided in 2015 to end its 16-year relationship with AmEx after the firms couldn’t agree on card fees. Last year, Citigroup became the exclusive credit-card issuer for the retailer. Citigroup said the terms of the Hilton deal didn’t make economic sense for a relatively small portfolio. Hilton represents about 1 percent of the bank’s $126.4 billion U.S. credit-card loans. “For over 15 years, Citi and Hilton enjoyed a terrific co-brand credit card partnership, however during negotiations it became clear that terms of exclusivity, given the relatively small size of the portfolio, were not economically viable,” Jud Linville, CEO of Citigroup’s global cards business, said in a phone interview. Citigroup intends to focus on "core" co-brand partners including Costco, American Airlines Group Inc. and AT&T Inc., he said. AmEx, Hilton Chenault said at an investor conference Thursday that the Hilton deal won’t have a material effect on earnings and probably won’t have any bearing on its chances of keeping the Starwood partnership. When Hilton opened the bidding for its co-brand portfolio a year and a half ago, it received “tremendous response” from issuers, said Mark Weinstein, global head of customer engagement, loyalty and partnerships at the hotel chain. Ultimately, it was AmEx’s focus on innovation that sold Hilton, he said, adding the hotelier has 63 million members in its Hilton Honors program. “We’re not announcing any new benefits at this time, but I think Hilton Honors members can look forward to new cardmember benefits,” said Denise Pickett, president of U.S. consumer services at American Express.

But it is not often that the seller is the central bank of a brutal, cash-strapped regime faced with protests; the buyer, a bulge-bracket American investment bank; and the size of the deal in the billions of dollars. A report in the Wall Street Journal on May 28th that Goldman Sachs had bought bonds with a face value of $2.8bn issued by Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, PDVSA, for 31 cents on the dollar (ie, for $865m) caused a stink. Julio Borges, an opposition politician and president of the National Assembly, lambasted Goldman on May 29th in an open letter to its chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein, for its decision to “aid and abet Venezuela’s dictatorial regime”. For all its sins, that regime has met its obligations to bondholders. Mr Borges vowed to advise future Venezuelan governments not to repay the bonds in question. Protesters gathered outside Goldman’s headquarters in New York. The bank acknowledged buying the bonds but said it had done so from a broker, not directly from the government, and invested because it believed that life in Venezuela would get better.

Nor is Venezuela the first dictatorship to give priority to debt service over providing necessities to its people. But one factor that has changed is the role of indices in directing investment. Just days before this transaction came to light, Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan minister now at Harvard, had argued that JPMorgan Chase should exclude Venezuelan-government bonds from the emerging-market bond indices it compiles. Investors, he alleged, were profiting from the suffering of Venezuelans by buying what he called “hunger bonds”. In some indices, such as JPMorgan’s EMBI+ or Morningstar’s “emerging-markets high-yield bond” one, Venezuelan-government and PDVSA bonds represent only a small slice of the portfolio (around 5%), but are so cheap they contribute nearly a fifth of yield. Bloomberg also includes Venezuelan bonds in its indices. But JPMorgan’s is the most widely quoted, and drew Mr Hausmann’s ire. Such indices serve both as a benchmark for active managers (ie, those that seek to beat an index for their investors) and to determine the allocation of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) run by such firms as BlackRock or Vanguard. America’s largest ETF for emerging-market bonds is a BlackRock one with $11.6bn under management. It tracks a different JPMorgan index but holds nearly $275m-worth of Venezuelan bonds at current market prices, and derives over 10% of its total yield from them. Goldman’s big bet has drawn a lot of attention. But indexmakers, ETF providers, asset managers and, of course, their investors have all been happy to make money out of Venezuela’s unsavoury debt.

President Donald J. Trump is the 45th President of the United States. President Donald J. Trump being sworn in as the 45th President of the United States on January 20th, 2017. President Trump addressed a joint session of Congress for the first time on February 28th, 2017. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump at The White House. By Paul R. La Monica NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Bank stocks surged after Donald Trump was elected on the hopes that he would scale back some of President Obama's Wall Street reforms and boost the economy with a massive stimulus package. And even though Trump bashed Wall Street (and his opponent Hillary Clinton's ties to big banks) repeatedly during the campaign, Trump tapped several former Goldman Sachs employees for key posts in the White House. The two most notable were Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, who even stepped down as Goldman COO to take the job. So it seemed that it was nothing but blue skies ahead for financial stocks. It hasn't turned out that way. Goldman Sachs has fallen 11% so far in 2017. JPMorgan Chase has dropped 5%. Morgan Stanley's stock is down slightly too. Citigroup's stock is actually in the black, but it's only up 2% -- less than the broader market. What gives? Ironically enough, the stock market is currently in the midst of an unusually quiet stretch -- despite the fact that the environment in Washington is anything but calm and serene. The VIX, a measure of volatility often referred to as Wall Street's fear gauge is back to levels where it was trading at just before the market's brief freakout last month, when the Dow fell nearly 373 points following the Comey-Trump-Flynn allegations. And CNNMoney's Fear & Greed Index, which includes the VIX and six other indicators of market sentiment, is currently stuck in Neutral territory. That's yet another sign of the typical Wall Street blahs during the start of the summer. To be sure, this is great news for most investors. Earnings in the first quarter were strong, thanks largely to solid results from big tech companies, many of whom disagree with Trump's stances on immigration and climate change. (So much for Trump being bad for Silicon Valley and good for Wall Street.) But volatility is often the best friend for big Wall Street firms. The lack of is posing to be a problem. JPMorgan Chase chief financial officer Marianne Lake said at a Deutsche Bank investment conference Wednesday that trading volumes were down 15% from a year ago so far in the second quarter, mostly in its fixed income division. She referred to current conditions as a "quite subdued and challenging trading environment." Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, speaking at a Sanford C. Bernstein conference on Wednesday, said trading volumes are down 10% to 12% in second quarter. And Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman told Bloomberg in an interview from Beijing that his firm was seeing similar trends in its trading division. Gorman said in the interview that the comments from Lake and Moynihan "are reflecting reality and I don't think we're very different." He added that "we all have similar clients, if not the same clients." Another issue for the big banks? Interest rates remain relatively low. More specifically, the difference between long-term and short-term bond rates is relatively narrow. That's known as a flat yield curve on Wall Street. And it's also not great news for banks. It makes their lending businesses less profitable. Both Lake and Moynihan acknowledged the flattening yield curve as another factor that is hurting their earnings. And the banks may not get much help from Trump in that department either -- or the Federal Reserve for that matter. Some thought that Trump's stimulus plan, which was expected to be funded partly through more government debt, would lift longer-term bond yields. But it's now unclear what Trump and Congress will be able to accomplish this year. Meanwhile. the Fed is likely to keep raising rates, but at a slow and gradual pace. All of this is, once again, could be great news for consumers and most investors. But it's not going to help Trump's friends on Wall Street.

Taking the tech giant's 70/30 revenue split into account, that means customers have spent over $100 billion in App Store purchases.

The Nasdaq gained 0.78 percent, also posting a record high. The S&P 500 rose 0.76 percent to an all-time high, with materials and health care leading advancers. The health care sector reached its first 52-week high since March 15. Economists polled by Reuters expect the U.S. economy to have added 185,000 jobs last month. But David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, said expectations may have increased in the market after a strong report from ADP and Moody's Analytics. The Thursday report said private payrolls surged by 253,000 in May, easily topping a consensus estimate of 185,000. "It was a very good, positive surprise. We've had a few negative surprises, so this is definitely against the current," said JPMorgan Funds' Kelly. "Overall, it says the economy is still moving along nicely." The report from ADP and Moody's is often seen as a preview to the U.S. government's nonfarm payrolls report, which is set for release Friday at 8:30 a.m.  Wall Street had a slew of data to digest Thursday, including weekly jobless claims, which came in at 248,000, above a forecast of 239,000. The ISM manufacturing index for May came in at 54.9, just below an estimate of 55.0. April construction spending fell 1.4 percent with economists forecasting a gain of 0.5 percent. Auto companies, meanwhile, released monthly vehicle sales throughout the day. The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq are coming off solid monthly performances in May. S&P and Nasdaq posted monthly gains of 1.16 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively, while the Dow rose about a third of a percent on the back of a subdued volatility environment. The CBOE Volatility Index broke below 10 six times last month, hitting levels not seen in more than 20 years. "Investors worry that the relationship between decreasing volatility and increased purchases could morph from a virtuous cycle to self-fulfilling feedback frenzy, leading to a vicious, volatility induced selloff," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. "The extent of a potential downdraft depends on how large the risk-parity investment community is. It's widely believed that the mass of money managed under a risk-parity mandate remains small, although it's a trend worth watching," Ablin said in a note. Tech stocks were among the best performers as the sector continued to build on its stellar year-to-date gains. Tech has gained nearly 20 percent in 2017. By comparison, consumer discretionary, the second-best-performing sector, is up 12 percent. "Most of the growth has come from large-cap growth stocks," said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt. "It's still a momentum-driven market that's skeptical about cyclical land." In corporate news, shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise slipped more than 5 percent after the firm reported a significant decline in quarterly sales. Marathon Petroleum approved an additional $3 billion to its shares repurchase program. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

And even though Trump bashed Wall Street (and his opponent Hillary Clinton’s ties to big banks) repeatedly during the campaign, Trump tapped several former Goldman Sachs employees for key posts in the White House. The two most notable were Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, who even stepped down as Goldman COO to take the job. So it seemed that it was nothing but blue skies ahead for financial stocks. It hasn’t turned out that way. Goldman Sachs has fallen 11% so far in 2017. JPMorgan Chase has dropped 5%. Morgan Stanley’s stock is down slightly too. Citigroup’s stock is actually in the black, but it’s only up 2% — less than the broader market. What gives? Ironically enough, the stock market is currently in the midst of an unusually quiet stretch — despite the fact that the environment in Washington is anything but calm and serene. The VIX, a measure of volatility often referred to as Wall Street’s fear gauge is back to levels where it was trading at just before the market’s brief freakout last month, when the Dow fell nearly 373 points following the Comey-Trump-Flynn allegations. And CNNMoney’s Fear & Greed Index, which includes the VIX and six other indicators of market sentiment, is currently stuck in Neutral territory. That’s yet another sign of the typical Wall Street blahs during the start of the summer. To be sure, this is great news for most investors. Earnings in the first quarter were strong, thanks largely to solid results from big tech companies, many of whom disagree with Trump’s stances on immigration and climate change. (So much for Trump being bad for Silicon Valley and good for Wall Street.) But volatility is often the best friend for big Wall Street firms. The lack of is posing to be a problem. JPMorgan Chase chief financial officer Marianne Lake said at a Deutsche Bank investment conference Wednesday that trading volumes were down 15% from a year ago so far in the second quarter, mostly in its fixed income division. She referred to current conditions as a “quite subdued and challenging trading environment.” Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, speaking at a Sanford C. Bernstein conference on Wednesday, said trading volumes are down 10% to 12% in second quarter. And Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman told Bloomberg in an interview from Beijing that his firm was seeing similar trends in its trading division. Gorman said in the interview that the comments from Lake and Moynihan “are reflecting reality and I don’t think we’re very different.” He added that “we all have similar clients, if not the same clients.” Another issue for the big banks? Interest rates remain relatively low. More specifically, the difference between long-term and short-term bond rates is relatively narrow. That’s known as a flat yield curve on Wall Street. And it’s also not great news for banks. It makes their lending businesses less profitable. Both Lake and Moynihan acknowledged the flattening yield curve as another factor that is hurting their earnings. And the banks may not get much help from Trump in that department either — or the Federal Reserve for that matter. Some thought that Trump’s stimulus plan, which was expected to be funded partly through more government debt, would lift longer-term bond yields. But it’s now unclear what Trump and Congress will be able to accomplish this year. Meanwhile. the Fed is likely to keep raising rates, but at a slow and gradual pace. All of this is, once again, could be great news for consumers and most investors. But it’s not going to help Trump’s friends on Wall Street.

Barclays Plc reached a long-term target for shrinking its stake in its African unit earlier than expected as the bank boosted the size of a share sale by more than 50%. The London-based lender is selling 285.7 million shares of Barclays Africa Group, equal to a 33.7% stake, at R132 each, it said in a statement on Thursday. The bank previously planned to sell a 22% stake and said it boosted the size of the offering “due to strong investor demand.” The sale will raise about R37.7 billion ($2.9 billion) and is part of plans by chief executive officer Jes Staley, 60, to reduce the lender’s presence on the continent in favor of supporting a trimmed-down investment bank focused on London and New York. The British bank, which has had a presence on the continent for more than 100 years, first bought a controlling stake in the Johannesburg-based lender in 2005 when it was still called Absa Group. The placement accelerates Barclays’s plan to gradually sell down its stake and deconsolidate the unit from its accounts, releasing capital that can be invested elsewhere in the business. Barclays had initially paid $5.4 billion for a 60% holding. That stake increased to more than 62% in 2013 as part of a reshuffle that saw Absa take over Barclays’s operations in eight African countries. JPMorgan upgrade The Public Investment Corporation, South Africa’s largest money manager, will buy a 7% stake in Barclays Africa as part of the sale once it has obtained regulatory approvals, the Johannesburg-based lender said in an emailed statement. That will help cut the stake held by Barclays, which currently owns 50.1%, to 16.4%. The British lender’s stake will drop to 15% — reaching its target level and allowing the bank to deconsolidate the unit from its capital calculations — after the completion of a transaction aimed at boosting the participation of black investors in Barclays Africa, it said. Barclays shares jumped 2% to 214.1 pence at 8:16am in London. JPMorgan Chase & Co. analysts led by Raul Sinha upgraded their rating on Barclays shares to overweight following the larger sale, saying it narrowed the firm’s gap to peers on capital ratios and could provide the ability to boost dividends. The securities are being sold at an almost 10% discount to Barclays Africa’s closing price on Tuesday. Barclays Africa rose 2.4% to R142.32 in Johannesburg after tumbling 4.8% on Wednesday. Second sale The second sale follows the disposal of a 12.2% stake to fund managers in South Africa and abroad in May 2016. The latest phase was said to have been delayed after South African President Jacob Zuma fired Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan at the end of March, replacing him with Malusi Gigaba. Gordhan had given provisional approval to a separation agreement that involves the UK lender paying its subsidiary 765 million pounds ($987 million). Deconsolidating Barclays Africa and including the proceeds from the sale will boost Barclays’s common equity Tier 1 ratio, the key measure of capital strength, by at least 0.73 percentage point, the lender said. The share placement is being coordinated by Barclays itself, aided by Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and UBS Group, according to the statement. Barclays can’t sell any more Barclays Africa stock for 90 days after the latest placement is settled, a provision known as a lock-up restriction.

Darren Boey Morgan Stanley reported $1.71 billion in first-quarter revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities. Photo: Bloomberg Hong Kong: Morgan Stanley chief executive officer James Gorman indicated his firm is seeing similar trading declines as competitors JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp., which said second-quarter trading revenue is on pace to drop at least 10%. The estimates from JPMorgan and Bank of America “are reflecting reality and I don’t think we’re very different,” Gorman said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Tom Mackenzie in Beijing. “We all have similar clients, if not the same clients.” Markets revenue at JPMorgan was down about 15% in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a slump in fixed income, chief financial officer Marianne Lake said on Wednesday at an investor conference in New York. At Bank of America, revenue from the business will be 10% to 12% lower, though first-half results should be stronger, chief executive officer Brian Moynihan said at a separate event. Analysts at JPMorgan warned this month that revenue at the world’s biggest investment banks is likely to drop in the second quarter because of the decline in fixed income. The UK’s exit from the European Union and US President Donald Trump’s surprise election win had been fuelling wagers on corporate bonds and the direction of interest rates over the past year, boosting Wall Street trading results. Those types of stimulants have been more scarce in recent months. Passive investors Gorman said markets are facing a “conundrum,” with economic growth generally strong but the world facing an uncertain political environment. Trump’s administration has faced resistance in pushing an ambitious agenda of tax overhaul and repealing Obamacare, he said. “There is enormous uncertainty which typically would breed tremendous volatility and it’s not,” Gorman said. “It’s this very passive perspective that investors have and I think the downside risk at this point is outweighing the upside risk.” In April, Morgan Stanley reported $1.71 billion in first-quarter revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities, allowing it to beat bigger rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for the first time since 2011. After concluding that new rules had permanently impaired the outlook for fixed-income markets, Morgan Stanley moved last year to slash a quarter of its sales and trading staff and sold large chunks of its commodities business. The results marked the fourth straight quarter Morgan Stanley posted bond-trading revenue exceeding $1 billion after Gorman said the business could produce at least $4 billion annually. The fixed-income division—crucial to the CEO’s plan to improve company-wide returns—was overhauled after revenue plunged to $550 million in the final quarter of 2015. Trading chief Ted Pick cut about 25% of the division’s staff and assigned equities executive Sam Kellie-Smith to turn around the business. Asked if he saw further scope for headcount reduction at the bank, Gorman said: “I don’t think so.” “The basic reshaping of the firm that has taken place over five to eight years is essentially done and we feel good about it,” he said.

That’s not necessarily good for Wall Street banks. Top executives at JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are lamenting that there’s too little happening in the world to spur investors to buy and sell. Yet at the same time, there’s just enough uncertainty over geopolitics and U.S. tax reform to restrain corporate mergers and acquisitions. Remarks from those three banks’ leaders signal that almost a year of geopolitical turmoil that began with the U.K.’s surprise vote to exit the European Union, and then escalated with Donald Trump’s surprise victory in the U.S. presidential election, may be cooling. Wall Street had gorged as customers adjusted to every shock. Now it seems many are inured: Trump’s early morning tweets aren’t enough to keep trading desks buzzing. “Volatility hasn’t been that great actually -- it’s made for a very tough slog,” Eric Wasserstrom, a banking analyst at Guggenheim Securities LLC, said Wednesday on Bloomberg Television. Still, “I don’t know if we really want to be rooting for political dislocation as something that really helps the investment banking community.” ‘Idiosyncratic Events’ At JPMorgan, markets revenue tumbled about 15 percent in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a fixed-income slump, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told investors in New York on Wednesday morning. At Bank of America, revenue from the business will be 10 percent to 12 percent lower, Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said at another event that day. At Goldman, clients’ trading remains “subdued,” co-President David Solomon said. “There haven’t been that many idiosyncratic events, and we need a few more of them,” Lake said. “As a sweeping generalization, low rates, a more cautious outlook on rates, and low volatility have led to low client flows and a generally quiet, subdued and challenging trading environment.” Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman indicated his firm is seeing similar trading declines. The estimates from JPMorgan and Bank of America “are reflecting reality and I don’t think we’re very different,” Gorman said in an interview with Bloomberg Television in Beijing on Thursday. A lot hasn’t happened this quarter. Centrist Emmanuel Macron prevailed in France’s presidential election last month, heading off euro-skeptic Marine Le Pen and taking pressure off the currency bloc. Trump struggled to score major legislative victories. And while tensions escalated between the U.S. and North Korea, they didn’t veer into open warfare. Read more: Stress-free markets in calmest run since 2014 Still, the trading doldrums described by bank executives on Wednesday caught their shareholders off guard. Goldman Sachs’s stock fell hardest, dropping 3.3 percent to the lowest since November, leading a decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Bank of America and JPMorgan both slid more than 2 percent. Investors were aware that volatility was muted but were expecting trading revenues to fall only about 5 percent from the year-earlier period, Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a phone interview.  “There’s just been no event this quarter” comparable with last year’s, such as Brexit, he said. The Federal Reserve’s meeting in June could provide fodder for bank clients, Cassidy said. Traders are expecting the Fed to outline how and when it plans to shrink its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. And futures prices indicate an 88 percent chance the Fed is poised to raise rates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. If either of those don’t go according to expectations, banks could jump on the opportunity to trade. Underwriting Down In the first quarter, profits at several of the biggest U.S. banks trounced estimates, fueled by revenue from fixed-income sales and trading. Altogether, the five biggest U.S. banks took in 51 percent more from debt underwriting than a year earlier, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Fresh debts typically help spur trading in the secondary market. This quarter, new debt issuance has waned or stagnated in almost every major market. U.S. investment-grade bond underwriting declined 6.7 percent, European deals dropped 18 percent, and emerging-market bonds were flat through May 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Even new loans -- typically more desirable for investors when rates are rising because the interest they charge can adjust -- declined globally by 28 percent, the data show.

Sign Up Equities trading -- a business that’s been transforming into a lower-fee, largely electronic market -- may hold up for banks this quarter even after the CBOE Volatility Index for the S&P 500 neared a record low in May. In Europe, revenue from cash equities is on pace to rise 18 percent from the first quarter, while dropping “slightly” in the U.S., JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein wrote in a note to clients May 23. Still, revenue from stock derivatives will decline across regions, he said. Read more: Banks’ bond-trading boom to end, JPMorgan says JPMorgan’s Lake listed equities, especially corporate derivatives and prime brokerage, as an source of strength for the period. When it comes to mergers and acquisitions, uncertainties over European elections and U.S. tax reform have led companies to exercise caution, Solomon said. That’s despite steady growth and a competitive environment that encourages CEOs to act. As a result, Solomon said he expects a “reasonable pace” for deals. Gorman called the confluence of economic growth and political turmoil a “conundrum” for markets. “There is enormous uncertainty, which typically would breed tremendous volatility, and it’s not,” Gorman said. “It’s this very passive perspective that investors have, and I think the downside risk at this point is outweighing the upside risk.” Even if turmoil -- and thus trading -- revives, the reward for many employees may be limited. Executives said they’re trying hard to keep a lid on costs. Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Marty Chavez put it like this alongside Solomon: “As revenue growth occurs, you should expect comp growth to lag.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Even the names of nearby boat basins were reminders of Britain’s lost empire and postwar decline: the West and East India docks. George Iacobescu arrived in 1988, sent to oversee what at the time seemed like a bold, verging-on-insane idea: the creation of a financial district that would supplant the winding lanes and low-slung stone of the City, London’s traditional banking hub. Maintaining the City’s historical character and its views of St. Paul’s Cathedral made building skyscrapers there all but impossible then. Canary Wharf, as the development would be called, would offer bright, modern office towers and cutting-edge telecommunications, allowing London to compete with New York as a center of global finance. For the first few years, Canary Wharf looked like a colossal failure. Then, in the late 1990s, it began taking off, slowly at first and soon with dizzying speed—transformed, like London as a whole, by the power of international finance. On the 30th floor of its tallest skyscraper, Romanian-born Iacobescu, now the chief executive officer of Canary Wharf Group Plc, beams with pride as he surveys his domain, where 100,000 workers arrive every weekday at Chevron, HSBC, Intel, and JPMorgan Chase, among others. In an adjacent room, a forest of architectural models the size of small children shows its 16 million square feet of towers, malls, and underground rail links. Iacobescu gravitates to one in particular, illustrating the plans for a new district under construction east of the original site. Canary Wharf has changed so much that now people want to live there, and its tallest building will be residential. “The Chinese look at Canary Wharf and they say, ‘This is how cities should work,’ ” Iacobescu boasts. “The world wants to come here.” Perhaps, though, not as much as it did a little more than a year ago. The city that breathed life into Canary Wharf faces a fight for its future. Last June pollsters and investors confidently ruled out the possibility that British voters would decide to leave the European Union. The morning after 52 percent of them rebuked everything Canary Wharf stands for by voting to leave, the pound plunged to its lowest level in 30 years. By 9 a.m., Prime Minister David Cameron had announced his resignation. Within weeks, banks such as Goldman Sachs Group and JPMorgan were weighing how many staff they would have to relocate to Frankfurt or Dublin, threatening the engine of London’s $490 billion economy. Airlines slashed flights, universities reported plunging European applications, and—truly shocking—house prices slid. Its economic foundations under assault, the idea that London could ever, as then-Mayor Boris Johnson suggested in 2012, be the “capital of the world” sounded suddenly like a bad joke. At the rate things were going, the city would be lucky to even stay the capital of the United Kingdom if the Scots made good on renewed threats to secede. And that was before a pair of recent terror attacks—a March vehicle assault on Westminster Bridge and a suicide bomb on May 22 at Manchester Arena, which killed 22 people—gave London another reason to be on edge. “The Chinese look at Canary Wharf and they say, ‘This is how cities should work’ ” But while the ubiquity of the “Keep Calm and Carry On” mantra may have diluted the brand a little, that’s exactly what London is doing. A loose grouping of London business and political leaders has coalesced to make the case that with the right mix of policies, the city’s economy can thrive despite Brexit. Earlier this year, TheCityUK, the main lobbying group for the all-important financial industry, called leaving the EU “a once-in-a-generation opportunity” to reorient trade and investment links to new markets. Mayor Sadiq Khan is using the tumult to try to wrest more autonomy over transport, infrastructure, and perhaps even immigration. And the booming tech sector is pushing to turn the crisis into an opportunity to overhaul regulations to make the U.K. the preferred jurisdiction for testing uncharted inventions. Those plans are taking shape in an environment of continued political turbulence. Cameron’s Conservative Party successor, Theresa May, is fighting an unexpectedly fierce battle in the June 8 general election against Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. After a series of missteps by May and her advisers—including a perceived U-turn on a key plank of her party’s manifesto on social care—her once seemingly unassailable lead is under threat as voters fret about her ability to deliver a “strong and stable” Britain. M by Montcalm, a hotel near the Silicon Roundabout. Photographer: Barry Lewis/In Pictures/Getty Images May is still expected to win a majority of seats, and whatever the U.K.’s immediate political future, economic apocalypse is nowhere in sight. More skyscrapers are under construction than ever, and residential asking prices have hit a record. Amazon.com, Facebook, and Google have announced major expansions of their London footprints since last summer, the latter becoming a principal tenant in a massive redevelopment of the once slightly seedy King’s Cross neighborhood. Next year the ribbon will be cut on the Elizabeth Line, or Crossrail, a 13-mile, ultrahigh-capacity express subway linking Heathrow to the heart of the city and beyond. The airport itself is midway through an ambitious expansion, with shiny new terminals largely complete and a long-contested third runway finally moving forward. Indeed, what some supporters of the “Remain” camp warned of seems to be coming to pass: The places likeliest to suffer badly from Brexit are the U.K.’s troubled industrial heartlands, regions that overwhelmingly supported leaving but have far less ability to adapt to its effects than the dynamic capital. London “has a global and particularly European competitive advantage that has been built over decades,” says John McFarlane, the chairman of banking group Barclays Plc. “It cannot be replicated easily in other centers.” It’s impossible to overstate the intensity of the U.K.’s ties with the rest of Europe, and those pulling for London still have deep concerns about what’s to come. Nonetheless, as Iacobescu’s experience at Canary Wharf shows, the global metropolis that’s contemporary London didn’t just spring fully formed from the damp Thames clay. It had to be made, by people, capital, and policies. That means it can be remade, too. By the turn of the 21st century, London was the economic center of Europe. Ambitious Scandinavian bankers, German architects, and Italian lawyers arrived in droves, able to move to the U.K. without so much as filling out a form, thanks to the EU’s free-movement rules. At one point, Mayor Johnson claimed there were a quarter-million French citizens in the capital, more than in the city of Bordeaux. It’s not exactly verifiable, but the fact that many Europeans accepted it as received wisdom served as further evidence of London’s dominance. At the same time, the city prospered from the expansion of emerging markets. It was where the multiplying elites from Russia, Saudi Arabia, India, and elsewhere came to spend their money, educate their children, start fashion lines, and occasionally race their custom Lamborghinis through the streets of Knightsbridge. As its internationalization intensified, the city came increasingly unmoored from the country as a whole, as if it had achieved escape velocity from the very idea of national borders. Many businesspeople use the U.K. “as a place to do business from, not necessarily to do business in,” says John Browne, former CEO of BP Plc, who now leads a Russian-backed global investment fund from offices in—where else?—London. The city’s success had many ingredients. The English language helped, as did a legal system of impartial courts and enforceable contracts, elite universities, and a tolerant attitude toward foreigners that dates back centuries. (It was London that gave Karl Marx a place from which to unpack capitalism’s evils after Germany, Belgium, and France expelled him.) Less talked about, but essential, is a degree of semi-deliberate government indifference to the precise sources of money flowing in from Moscow, the Middle East, and elsewhere—a stance unimaginable in the more prosecutorial U.S. That’s made investing in London far more attractive to emerging-country oligarchs eager to avoid taking chances with the IRS and U.S. Department of Justice. Despite London’s global appeal, the U.K.’s European status also has offered huge advantages. The EU is the destination for almost half of U.K. exports and the source of the same proportion of foreign direct investment. EU law allows a bank established in any member state to operate freely in any of the others, an advantage that U.S. and Asian lenders used to locate their European headquarters overwhelmingly in the U.K. Despite being outside the euro zone, the City came to dominate the market for euro-denominated derivatives, worth hundreds of billions of dollars daily, and to rival New York as the heart of investment banking and trading of all kinds. Just a mile up the road, a tech sector clustered around the ugly junction half-jokingly called Silicon Roundabout thrived as well, sustained by City investment and workers from throughout Europe and beyond. The victory of the nationalist Brexit campaign seemed to put all this at risk. How great a risk is hard to say. Some financial jobs will almost certainly have to relocate to meet EU regulatory requirements, depending on the shape of a final settlement with Brussels, and banks are making contingency plans. Estimates range from as few as 4,000 or so, according to management consultant Oliver Wyman, to a worst-case scenario of 232,000 detailed by Xavier Rolet, CEO of the London Stock Exchange Group, in January to a parliamentary committee. In other words, no one has a clue. “A place to do business from, not necessarily to do business in” How can London be saved from the worst predictions? As it happens, in addition to the Little England fantasies of cream teas and village cricket with which the “Leave” vote was often associated, there was always a liberal vision for Brexit, espoused by Johnson and others. The plan was a form of doubling down. Broadly, it entailed making the post-EU U.K. a sort of giant, cold Singapore—rabidly pro-capital, lightly taxed, and hospitable to innovation. The Brexit twist: a focus on connecting tightly to emerging markets. Within the EU, the U.K. benefited from the bloc’s network of trade agreements but was prohibited from negotiating any on its own. Now, the slightly wishful theory goes, it can do so with enthusiasm and speed—while winning a post-Brexit deal that preserves access to the EU’s huge economy. May began earlier this year to at least pay lip service to this notion of “Global Britain” and got away with it, despite the apparent desire of half the country’s citizens for exactly the opposite, in part by stoking a bit of indirect nostalgia for the bygone age of empire. Speaking in January to top-tier investors and CEOs at the World Economic Forum in Davos, she pledged to make the U.K. “the strongest and most forceful advocate for business, free markets, and free trade anywhere in the world.” If May follows through, implementing that vision shouldn’t, theoretically, be too difficult. The U.K. has a highly centralized system of government in which American-style gridlock is a virtual impossibility. Within reason, what the prime minister wants, she gets. Her government has already hinted that if it receives an unfavorable deal in negotiations with Brussels, it could retaliate by slashing its corporate tax rate—which at 19 percent is already far lower than those of the U.S., France, and Germany—to poach companies from neighboring countries. The U.K. has a track record of this sort of thing. Fiat Chrysler, Liberty Global, Aon, and other businesses, attracted by low taxes, have relocated operations to London in recent years. City Hall, the “glass gonad.” Photographer: Dinendra Haria/REX/Shutterstock One of the architects of London’s emergence as a financial capital is among those urging May to make some version of Global Britain a reality. Lord Nigel Lawson of Blaby, now 85 and ensconced in the oak-paneled sanctum of the House of Lords, oversaw the “Big Bang”—the U.K.’s sudden move to deregulate financial services—as chancellor of the Exchequer under Margaret Thatcher. He figured that a gradual removal of rules that benefited incumbents would foment too much opposition, so the decision was made to implement the changes on a single day in October 1986. It opened up the London Stock Exchange, previously run something like a not-very-lively gentlemen’s club, to a rush of overseas capital and brainpower. Sitting in an overstuffed red leather chair in one of the Palace of Westminster’s ubiquitous private bars, morning sun streaming in from the Thames through tall, neo-Gothic windows, Lawson advocates a similarly aggressive approach for prospering from Brexit. He rejects the charge that he’s anti-European; after all, he says, he lives most of the time at his country estate in southwest France, flying in to Heathrow for Lords debates. “London’s success owes nothing whatever to being in the European Union,” Lawson says, as if it should be obvious, but rather to “this huge collection of expertise” in finance and related industries that he argues will never pick up and go. The picture he paints of post-Brexit Britain is of a nation shorn of unhelpful multilateral entanglements, with “complete autonomy over our tax system,” which “should be, en principe, a low-tax system.” He speaks optimistically of restructuring immigration to remove the current distinction whereby bricklayers from Slovenia face no visa restrictions, yet American Ph.D.s must fill out miles of forms and cross their fingers—treating “citizens from anywhere in the world on an equal basis.” And proving the notion that to scratch a Brexiteer is to quickly uncover fond memories of the last time there was such a thing as Global Britain, Lawson says that as Europe’s economy stagnates, “it’s the emerging world which is really going places. And a large part of the emerging world is the former empire”—India, Nigeria, Malaysia, and so on, with which Britain still enjoys close cultural and political ties. Indeed, there’s an argument to be made that the emerging economies need London as a stable venue for making deals and protecting assets. For its part, TheCityUK has suggested reimagining trade deals to focus on the sale of services, which the U.K. exports in spades, rather than just goods, which are less important to its economy. Another possibility being floated in the City: scrapping or loosening the EU-imposed cap on bonuses for bankers. Limiting windfalls to twice a person’s fixed pay, the gap is understandably unpopular there. The tech industry has also been active. In December a collection of local players, including Skype co-founder Niklas Zennstrom and Sonali De Rycker of venture capital company Accel, wrote an open letter to May calling on her to preserve maximum access to the EU’s “single market” and to provide automatic visas for tech graduates as part of a post-Brexit immigration strategy. The group had other, more unusual suggestions. The most eye-catching was that the U.K. should engage in “regulatory arbitrage” for technologies such as drones and blockchain. In the words of Mattias Ljungman of venture firm Atomico, which he co-founded with Zennstrom, the country could use its nimble system of government to become a “neutral zone” for testing ideas that other places restrict. There are some indications this is already happening. The U.K.’s main financial watchdog has created a “regulatory sandbox” that allows fintech firms to do real-world tests of products that normal rules might not allow. And Amazon is conducting trials of its delivery-by-drone program near Cambridge after complaining the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration wasn’t moving fast enough to change American flight rules. The task of marshaling these forces has fallen to Mayor Khan. The 46-year-old’s biography couldn’t be further from the usual Eton-and-Oxbridge CV of British politics. His parents were immigrants from Pakistan who raised Khan and his seven siblings in public housing. After university he became a lawyer, working on racial discrimination and police brutality cases, before entering Parliament in 2005. Last year he became the first Muslim mayor of a major Western capital. Khan is often discussed as a future prime minister, and his political standing is in direct contrast to his physical presence. He’s quite short, and the navy blue suits he wears—always without a tie—as an unvarying uniform can look at least half a size too big. At one recent event, a photo op with high school students who towered over him, Khan’s dark-brown leather belt was cinched to the sixth notch. The mayor’s first year at City Hall, a riverside orb that Johnson dubbed “the glass gonad,” has been consumed by the fallout of the referendum. Like a lawyer making arguments before an all-powerful judge, he’s relentlessly made the case to business leaders not to give up on London and sought to counter the Britain-first message of Brexit with a nonstop calendar of speeches, international trade missions, and slickly produced ads showing off the city’s diversity. There’s substance behind the marketing blitz. To protect London’s appeal, Khan is pursuing even more heavy-duty infrastructure, including Crossrail 2, another massive rail line through the heart of the city. He’s also suggested the creation of a “London visa,” whereby a foreigner with a job offer from a local company could be given permission to live and work in the capital and not elsewhere. That’s not as crazy as it sounds. Canada and Australia have regional visa policies for some migrants. And it’s hard to argue with the idea’s inherent logic. Unlike much of the rest of the country, diverse London has no problem with newcomers. What these prescriptions for a vibrant metropolis all share is a focus on talent, a conviction that London can’t hope to succeed without brainy immigrants. Politically, that happens to be the most difficult item on the wish list to deliver. The Brexit vote was widely interpreted by politicians as a backlash against immigration, and May has said repeatedly that gaining control of the borders—i.e., ending freedom of movement for European citizens—is a nonnegotiable red line for her government in talks with its European counterparts. What will replace the open-door policy is anyone’s guess. So, too, is the evolution of the current, less permissive system for non-EU workers. While May in January said that “openness to international talent must remain one of this country’s most distinctive assets,” she’s not a likely candidate to champion a relaxed approach. In her previous role as home secretary, she was the public face of a pledge, never fulfilled but recently reiterated as Conservative policy, to reduce annual inflows to the “tens of thousands.” Despite pleas from business groups and members of her own party, she’s also refused to formally guarantee that EU citizens already in the U.K., who number in the millions, will be able to stay—even though no one realistically expects any other outcome. “If you really want to understand what’s behind the success of London, it’s that the city is a powerful magnet for international talent. It’s all based on people,” says Gregor Irwin, the chief economist at political consultant Global Counsel. Politicians who want to preserve that will have to contend, he says, “with a prime minister who’s still hellbent on bringing down the overall numbers.” Free trade and a permissive attitude to technological disruption weren’t what, say, underemployed pipe fitters in Stoke-on-Trent had in mind when they voted for Brexit. Telling them the country must continue to prioritize the interests of footloose international capital to prosper is a lot to ask of May, who leans more populist than many Conservatives. Perhaps more daunting, a swashbuckling, neo-Elizabethan vision of a Britain dedicated to conquering new markets ignores that U.K. companies have prioritized the giant bloc on their doorstep for decades. As an alternative, reorienting the economy toward emerging markets would mean “a quantum shift in terms of our trade strategy,” says Martin Sorrell, CEO of London-based advertising giant WPP Plc. If the U.K. loses its links to the EU and fails to develop ones with other regions, the risk is that “we become an isolated island instead of a connected one,” he says. As London’s business elites weigh how to sell politicians on their vision, what they view as sensible economic policy can feel hard to reconcile with the demands of an angry populace. On a chilly early March evening, a crowd of bankers, corporate executives, and diplomats filed past a military string ensemble in formal red uniforms as a crier in an elaborate sash shouted entering guests’ names. The occasion was the annual Business and Investment Dinner at Mansion House, the City’s ceremonial heart—a Palladian pile that since the 1700s has been where deals are struck, successes are celebrated, and postprandial port is passed to the diner on one’s left. “The pound is down,” began the grace as guests sat down to smoked-and-peppered mackerel terrine. But “stocks are up, so let us be thankful as we sup.” As dinner moved on past the roast rib-eye served with mushroom panna cotta and a full-bodied 2001 Pessac-Léognan, Lord Mayor Andrew Parmley, the City’s official leader, rose to address the subject on everyone’s mind. Next to him was Business Secretary Greg Clark, a member of May’s cabinet responsible for economic policy, representing the national government. “Free trade, ambition, openness to new ideas, techniques, and talent,” Parmley recited, glancing occasionally at his neighbor. “They can power the future success of what is, what has always been, and indeed in my opinion always will be, the world’s greatest city.” It was meant as a confident affirmation of the obvious. Instead, it sounded a little like a plea. Canary Wharf. Photographer: Incamerastock/Alamy Stock Photo At Canary Wharf, Iacobescu talks up London’s advantages with the zeal of a convert, which he is—before he arrived, he lived in Toronto and then New York, helping build the World Financial Center. “Why are all the institutions here?” he asks. “Because of the language, because of the regulatory regime, because of the time zone, because of the infrastructure, because of the know-how. All these things haven’t disappeared.” Banks and companies that depend on them, he says, have no intention of abandoning a city that helped make them rich. Yet even the optimism of a man whose job it is to sell London to the world has its limits. As Iacobescu circumnavigates his largest architectural model of the district, reciting from memory the addresses of companies such as Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and American Express, one tower makes him wince slightly: the European Medicines Agency, the EU equivalent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a major Canary Wharf tenant. Like every other EU institution with a U.K. presence, it will almost surely soon depart, perhaps for Milan, perhaps Copenhagen. It’s a small example of an important reality: If London is no longer the “gateway to Europe,” he says, losing growth to Frankfurt, Paris, or New York is inevitable. While Iacobescu believes in London as much as anyone, he concedes that without enlightened leadership, its strengths may not be enough to overcome harsh political reality. “London is a great city,” he says. “But the effort should be to keep it the capital of the world.” —With Stephen Morris   Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

Hugh SonDakin Campbell Markets revenue at JPMorgan was down about 15% in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a slump in fixed income. Photo: Bloomberg New York: JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America, the two biggest US banks, said June-quarter trading revenue is on pace to drop at least 10% because tranquil markets are curbing demand. Bank shares slid after the revenue updates and led the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower. Markets revenue at JPMorgan was down about 15% in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a slump in fixed income, chief financial officer Marianne Lake said Wednesday at an investor conference in New York. At Bank of America, revenue from the business will be 10% to 12% lower, though first-half results should be stronger, chief executive officer Brian Moynihan said at a separate event. A top Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive agreed that clients’ trading remains “subdued,” while, on Thursday in Beijing, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman indicated his firm is seeing a similar trend. Analysts at JPMorgan warned this month that revenue at the world’s biggest investment banks is likely to drop in the second quarter because of the decline in fixed income. The UK’s exit from the European Union and Donald Trump’s surprise election win had been fuelling wagers on corporate bonds and the direction of interest rates over the past year, boosting Wall Street trading results. Those types of stimulants have been more scarce in recent months. “There haven’t been that many idiosyncratic events, and we need a few more of them,” Lake said. “As a sweeping generalization, low rates, a more cautious outlook on rates, and low volatility have led to low client flows and a generally quiet, subdued and challenging trading environment.” In rates trading, clients are cautious because of conflicting signs from unemployment and inflation data, Lake said. In corporate bonds, “people have cash but no conviction” as spreads are tight, she said. Equities, corporate derivatives and the prime brokerage were sources of strength in the quarter, she said. “Client activities, which were more subdued in the first (March) quarter, have in these first two months, continued in a comparable fashion in the second (June) quarter,” David Solomon, Goldman Sachs’s co-president, said at the same conference, declining to project the impact on the firm’s revenue. Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 3.3% to a six-month low of $211.26 in New York on Wednesday, while JPMorgan slid 2.1% to $82.15. The pair were the day’s worst performers in the Dow. Bank of America, which isn’t in the index, dropped 2.2% to $22.41. At JPMorgan, the last three quarters of 2016 generated record trading revenue, so the comparisons this year are harder for traders to live up to, Lake said. “If I look to June, I don’t see any particular reason for that to change,” Lake said. “But anything can happen in a month.” Speaking to Bloomberg Television in Beijing on Thursday, Morgan Stanley’s Gorman said the estimates from JPMorgan and Bank of America reflect the reality in the present trading environment. “I don’t think we’re very different,” he said. “We all have similar clients, if not the same clients.” “There is enormous uncertainty which typically would breed tremendous volatility and it’s not,” Gorman said. “It’s this very passive perspective that investors have and I think the downside risk at this point is outweighing the upside risk.” When it comes to mergers and acquisitions, uncertainties over European elections and US tax reform have led corporate executives to be cautious, Solomon said. That’s despite steady growth and a competitive environment that encourages CEOs to act. As a result, he expects a “reasonable pace” for deals, and said the environment has felt a little better in the past month or two than it did earlier in the year. Separately, analysts also asked about expense discipline. Goldman Sachs chief financial officer Marty Chavez, speaking at the same event as Solomon, told investors that when the firm’s revenue does climb, compensation will rise at a slower rate. Bank of America will take a charge of about $300 million to speed up data-center consolidation, and will report $125 million in severance, about double what’s typical, Moynihan said. The expenses are part of the firm’s goal of cutting total annual costs to $53 billion by the end of 2018. “We’re trying to accelerate opportunities, and so this quarter we’ll do a couple things to push some stuff through and really position us to make that $53 billion without a problem,” he said.

Kshitij Anand Moneycontrol News The Nifty is likely to open flat on Thursday, tracking muted handover from Wall Street. The index closed flat, but with a negative bias at 9,621 on Wednesday. But during the session, it hit a fresh record high of 9,649.60. The index failed to sustain at a higher level and pared most of its intraday gains to close in negative which made a small bearish candle on the daily candlestick charts, after rallying for four straight sessions. If the index manages to defend 9,600 this week, bullish momentum remains intact, but a close below this level could fuel further profit booking decline. Traders are advised to lighten up long positions if Nifty slips below 9,580-9,600, suggest experts. Stay tuned with Moneycontrol to find out what happens in currency and equity markets today. We have collated a list of important headlines from across news agencies. GDP expands at 7.1% in FY17 The Indian economy grew at 7.1 percent in 2016-17, the government said in new estimates on Wednesday, identical to the expansion projected in February, but slower than the previous year’s 8 percent growth. A 6.1 percent growth in January-March quarter, however, indicated that the economy is still smarting under the demonetisation shock that the sudden flush out of high-value notes and restricted cash access had caused on household spending and corporate investment. SGX Nifty The Nifty futures on the Singapore Stock Exchange were trading 8 points lower at 9,629 indicating a flat opening for the domestic market. Wall Street ends flat US stocks closed flat as financials dropped after JPMorgan and Bank of America warned of revenue weakness. JPMorgan blamed lower volatility for a 15 percent decline in trading revenue in the current quarter compared with last year, while Bank of America said trading revenue in the second quarter was on track to be 10 to 12 percent lower than last year, said a Reuters report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 20.82 points, or 0.1 percent, to 21,008.65, the S&P 500 lost 1.1 points, or 0.05 percent, to 2,411.81 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.67 points, or 0.08 percent, to 6,198.52. Petrol price hiked by Rs 1.23/litre, diesel by 89 paise Petrol price was today hiked by Rs 1.23 per litre and diesel by 89 paise a litre in sync with rising international fuel rates. Petrol price in Delhi will cost Rs 66.91 per litre as against Rs 65.32 a litre. Similarly, a litre of diesel will be priced at Rs 5.94, as compared to Rs 54.90 at present. Delhi Assembly passes state GST bill The Delhi Assembly today passed the state Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill even as Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal pitched for capping the tax rate at a maximum of 10 percent, said a report. A special session of the Assembly, which saw clashes between a few AAP MLAs and sacked minister Kapil Mishra, cleared the bill following an extensive discussion while also adopting a resolution on lowering tax slabs. Government meets 3.5% fiscal deficit target in 2016-17 The government on Wednesday said it has achieved the fiscal deficit target of 3.5 percent of GDP in 2016-17. For 2017-18, the government aims to further bring down the fiscal deficit gap between expenditure and revenue up to 3.2 percent, said a report. "Fiscal deficit is 3.51 percent of GDP or Rs 5.35 lakh crore in 2016-17," the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) said while releasing the provisional accounts for the last financial year. Dollar wobbles on U.S. political tension The dollar slid to two-week lows against the yen and a more than one-week trough versus the euro amid growing political tension in Washington said a report. Against a basket of major currencies, the dollar ended the month with its largest monthly percentage loss since January. The dollar was down 0.1 percent at 110.67 yen after earlier falling to two-week lows. The euro was up 0.5 percent at $1.1236, while the dollar index fell 0.3 percent to 96.99. India, Spain sign 7 agreements India and Spain on Wednesday decided to widen defence partnership, conclude a civil nuclear deal and share best practices to jointly fight terror, said a report.

At Bank of America, revenue from the business will be 10 percent to 12 percent lower, though first-half results should be stronger, Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said at a separate event. Read more about Lake and Moynihan’s comments. Analysts at JPMorgan warned this month that revenue at the world’s biggest investment banks is likely to drop in the second quarter because of the decline in fixed income. The U.K.’s exit from the European Union and U.S. President Donald Trump’s surprise election win had been fueling wagers on corporate bonds and the direction of interest rates over the past year, boosting Wall Street trading results. Those types of stimulants have been more scarce in recent months. Morgan Stanley's Gorman Says Growth in India Is Exciting Passive Investors Gorman said markets are facing a “conundrum,” with economic growth generally strong but the world facing an uncertain political environment. Trump’s administration has faced resistance in pushing an ambitious agenda of tax overhaul and repealing Obamacare, he said. “There is enormous uncertainty which typically would breed tremendous volatility and it’s not,” Gorman said. “It’s this very passive perspective that investors have and I think the downside risk at this point is outweighing the upside risk.” The most important market news of the day.

Sign Up In April, Morgan Stanley reported $1.71 billion in first-quarter revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities, allowing it to beat bigger rival  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for the first time since 2011. After concluding that new rules had permanently impaired the outlook for fixed-income markets, Morgan Stanley moved last year to slash a quarter of its sales and trading staff and sold large chunks of its commodities business.

The fixed-income division -- crucial to the CEO’s plan to improve companywide returns -- was overhauled after revenue plunged to $550 million in the final quarter of 2015. Trading chief Ted Pick cut about 25 percent of the division’s staff and assigned equities executive Sam Kellie-Smith to turn around the business. Asked if he saw further scope for headcount reduction at the bank, Gorman said: “I don’t think so.” “The basic reshaping of the firm that has taken place over five to eight years is essentially done and we feel good about it,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Fed’s Beige Book likely strengthened the case for a June rate hike, though some traders are questioning whether a September hike is in the cards. Still, the Dow closed lower for a third straight session, though the blue-chip index — as well as the  S&P 500 Index ( SPX )  and  Nasdaq Composite (COMP)  — finished the month in positive territory.  Continue reading for more on today’s market, including: The rare  Nasdaq signal that rang in 2009 just sounded again.  2 underloved electronics stocks with room to run.  While Michael Kors stock sank after earnings, this sector peer had its best day since its IPO .    Plus, the Amazon story going unnoticed; how options traders are playing Lululemon earnings; and a medical technology stock with room to run.

News Sports Living Obits Item Banner Cars Jobs E-Edition Subscriber Services log in Site Site Archive Stocks slide as banks, energy companies sink Wednesday May 31, 2017 at 11:12 AM May 31, 2017 at 4:34 PM The Associated Press NEW YORK — U.S. stocks are slipping for the second day in a row Wednesday, led by a slump in banks as investors worry how their trading businesses are doing this quarter. Energy companies are falling with the price of oil. Big technology companies and small-company stocks are also down. Those declines are canceling out gains for drug companies and household products makers. KEEPING SCORE: The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 4 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,408 as of 2:45 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 34 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,995. The Nasdaq composite fell 19 points, or 0.3 percent, to 6,184. The Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks again did worse than the other major indexes. It retreated 5 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,365. The S&P 500 is on track to finish May with a 1 percent gain. After a three-month losing streak last summer it has risen six out of the last seven months. BANKS: Banks fell as investors worried that their revenue from trading stocks, bonds and currencies is going to weaken in the second quarter. Executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America both spoke about that issue at industry events on Wednesday. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said trading revenue will fall 10 percent compared to a year ago. The banking industry had an outstanding first quarter, and trading was a key reason for that. JPMorgan Chase fell $1.87, or 2.2 percent, to $82.03 and Capital One slumped $1.63, or 2.1 percent, to $76.65. Goldman Sachs, which had an unusually bad quarter as its trading business struggled, gave up $7.28, or 3.3 percent, to $211.14. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.20 percent from 2.21 percent. That also hurt banks, as lower bond yields force interest rates lower on loans, reducing banks' profits from lending. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost $1.34, or 2.7 percent, to $48.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the standard for international oil prices, fell $1.53, or 3 percent, to $50.31 a barrel in London. Energy stocks continued to decline. Chevron sank 61 cents to $103.45 and Hess declined $1.04, or 2.2 percent, to $45.63. FEELING BETTER: Pfizer rose 58 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $32.71 and Irish drugmaker Perrigo climbed $3.71, or 5.5 percent, to $71.63 after its first-quarter report was better than expected. Health care products maker Johnson & Johnson advanced $1.45, or 1.1 percent, to $128.56. Household products companies also rose. Clorox gained $1.31, or 1 percent, to $136.24 and Kimberly-Clark, which makes Huggies diapers and Kleenex tissue, picked up $1.98, or 1.5 percent, to $130.95. Procter & Gamble, which makes Tide detergent and Charmin toilet paper, advanced 77 cents to $88.17. KORS GETS CORED: Michael Kors Holdings hit a five-year low after it said it will close up to 125 stores as its sales have remained weak. The luxury retailer said sales at older stores dropped in its latest quarter and investors were disappointed with its projections for the current quarter. The stock tumbled $3.51, or 9.7 percent, to $32.76. CLOUDY DAY FOR SOLAR: Solar power companies took losses as investors expected President Donald Trump to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate change agreement. Officials from the European Union said the EU and China will maintain their commitments to the pact. Shares of First Solar, the largest U.S. solar company, declined 92 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $38.58. SunPower fell 23 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $7.92 while solar wafer maker Canadian Solar retreated 73 cents, or 5.4 percent, to $12.81. HITTING RESET: Technology companies turned lower. The tech sector has reached its highest levels since the dot-com boom and companies like Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook have done far better than the rest of the market in 2017. Apple and Facebook are up 32 percent this year, and Alphabet is up 24 percent. All three slid Wednesday. CURRENCIES: The dollar slipped to 110.68 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro rose to $1.1239 from $1.1188. The British pound rose to $1.2882 from $1.2813. The currency was volatile after polls and surveys showed the general election on June 8 might be closer than expected. Early on, observers expected the Conservative Party of Prime Minister Theresa May to win in a landslide. May supports Britain's exit from the European Union, and if she wins a smaller majority, it could hurt her side as Britain negotiates its departure from the union. OTHER ENERGY TRADING: Wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.61 a gallon. Heating oil gave up 3 cents to $1.52 a gallon. Natural gas dropped 7 cents to $3.07 per 1,000 cubic feet. METALS: Gold rose $9.70 to $1,265.40 an ounce. Silver fell 2 cents to $17.41 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.58 a pound. OVERSEAS: European stocks gave up an early gain. The DAX in Germany remained up 0.1 percent, but France's CAC 40 lost 0.4 percent and the British FTSE 100 fell 0.1 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 index dipped 0.1 percent and South Korea's Kospi gained 0.2 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong inched down 0.1 percent.

Wednesday’s weakness was based on a familiar theme: doubts that prolonged cuts by OPEC and its allies will succeed in clearing a surplus while U.S. output remains so resilient. Even though Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said the cuts are working and predicted global inventories will fall to the five-year average in early 2018, American drillers continue to add rigs to shale fields, according to Bloomberg News’ Meenal Vamburkar. “There doesn’t seem to be an end to supply out there,” said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA. “And demand is not exactly rip-roaring.” American drillers last week boosted the number of active rigs to 722, the most since April 2015, according to data from Baker Hughes.  To the strategists at JPMorgan, the gyrations in the price have wide implications. The broad range of $40 to $60 a barrel that the market is stuck in is depressed enough in terms of average prices and wide enough “to complicate” a number of key trades that investors have piled into that are dependent on faster inflation. Those include shorting bonds, owning debt securities that protect against rising consumer prices, and betting on the currencies of some commodity-dependent economies over the next year. Energy stocks are the worst-performing sector in the MSCI All-Country World Index this year, falling 8.39 percent on average. HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN Despite a seventh straight month of gains for the global stock market, May ended with a bit of a whimper. Equities fell as financial stocks faltered on news from JPMorgan and Bank of America, the two biggest U.S. banks, that second-quarter trading revenue is on pace to drop at least 10 percent because tranquil markets are curbing demand, according to Bloomberg News’ Hugh Son and Dakin Campbell. Even before the latest revelations, financial shares were under pressure as a rally in longer-term bonds caused the difference between short- and long-term borrowing cost to shrink, raising concern about the health of banks’ net interest margins. One proxy of financial shares, the PowerShares KBW Bank Portfolio exchange-traded fund, dropped 2.80 in May, bringing its loss since the end of February to 7.40 percent. Financial shares had soared in the prior four months, leading markets higher on the prospect that the Trump administration would loosen restrictive bank regulations. The PowerShares KBW Bank Portfolio ETF soared 29 percent between the end of October and the end of February. PIMCO IS DOING LOTS OF HAND-WRINGING In fact, most of the Trump administration’s pro-growth policies are in doubt, from tax reform to infrastructure spending -- at least for this year. Pacific Investment Management Co. was out with a report Wednesday saying that investors have become too complacent and that monetary, fiscal, trade and geopolitical risks abound. As they see it, there’s a 70 percent chance of a recession in the next five years, according to Bloomberg News’ John Gittelsohn. “We believe that many market participants today are too relaxed, that medium-term risks are building and that investors should consider using cyclical rallies to build cash to deploy when markets eventually correct -- and possibly overshoot -- as risks are repriced,” the firm said in its annual “Secular Outlook” for the next three to five years. Of concern to Pimco is that policy makers are “driving without a spare tire” because of limited tools -- caused by big balance sheets and low or negative interest rates -- to deal with a recession. GOLD BUGS ABOUND Given the worrying over at Pimco, perhaps it’s not surprising that hedge funds are jumping back into gold at the fastest pace since 2007. Money managers boosted their long positions in U.S. futures by the most in almost a decade in the week ended May 23, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Bullion futures have posted three straight weekly gains, helped by U.S. and European political angst that has boosted demand for the metal as a haven, according to Bloomberg News’ Joe Richter. Those bets have paid off with gold advancing Wednesday to its highest since April 25, or $1,276.80 per ounce. According to strategists at BMO Capital Markets, the Federal Reserve’s monthly Beige Book economic report struck a dovish tone on the economy, offered a divergence from the “all is well" mantra as optimism waned in some districts, namely Boston, Chicago and New York. Is it too late to buy some gold? CHINA TAKES ON CURRENCY SPECULATORS Foreign-exchange traders and strategists alike are (re)learning a tough lesson: Don’t bet against the yuan. The currency has jumped to its highest level in seven months offshore, soaring as much as 1.1 percent on Wednesday alone, despite analyst forecasts for declines this quarter. Surging interbank rates are squeezing bears by driving up the cost of short positions, according to Bloomberg News’ Helen Sun, Molly Wei and Emma Dai. The rally, which broke months of calm against the dollar, came on the heels of an unwelcome credit-rating downgrade from Moody’s. China made its displeasure clear, calling the move “absolutely groundless.” The central bank had already been battling pessimistic traders by repeatedly strengthening the daily fixing. “The Moody’s downgrade and a weaker spot rate compared to the fixing could have spurred the authorities to change the fixing mechanism and potentially intervene in the market,” said Jason Daw, Singapore-based head of emerging-market currency strategy at Societe Generale. EMERGING-MARKET STOCKS FACE NEW ERA The stock markets of the world’s developing economies are about to undergo a bit of a revolution. As the index provider MSCI prepares to carry out its annual review in June, some of the world’s biggest markets -- with assets totaling almost $9 trillion -- are poised for reclassification, according to Bloomberg News’ Srinivasan Sivabalan. Perhaps the most notable are China and Saudi Arabia. China’s domestic equities were denied entry into MSCI’s benchmark indexes for a third year last June despite measures to address such concerns as repatriation limits and excessive trading suspensions. Only 169 mainland-listed companies will be considered for inclusion, down from 448 under a previous proposal, and all will be large-cap shares currently accessible to foreign investors through exchange links with Hong Kong. Two years after Saudi Arabia opened its stock market to global investors, foreign ownership has languished at about 5 percent and the equity index has lost about 30 percent. The market’s size fell by about $140 billion as the changes coincided with the government’s austerity measures. The country says its bourse has met all the criteria laid out by MSCI for inclusion. TEA LEAVES After Wednesday’s rather downbeat Beige Book, the monthly manufacturing report from the Institute for Supply Management will surely get extra attention. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News is for a reading of 54.6 for May, little changed from 54.8 in April. Recall that the weaker-than-expected result in April left the index essentially back at December’s levels that, according to the economists at Bloomberg Intelligence, may have been due to less optimism among manufacturers in the Trump administration’s capacity to deliver on a pro-manufacturing policy agenda. The BI economists say they will be paying attention to export orders, with any signs of resilience signaling a firming in external demand, which could provide a modest tailwind to growth.

Bank shares slid after the revenue updates and led the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Markets revenue at JPMorgan was down about 15 per cent in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a slump in fixed income, chief financial officer Marianne Lake said. Photo: Bloomberg Markets revenue at JPMorgan was down about 15 per cent in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a slump in fixed income, chief financial officer Marianne Lake said overnight at an investor conference in New York. At Bank of America, revenue from the business will be 10 per cent to 12 per cent lower, though first-half results should be stronger, chief executive officer Brian Moynihan said at a separate event. And a top Goldman Sachs executive agreed that clients' trading remains "subdued". Analysts at JPMorgan warned this month that revenue at the world's biggest investment banks was likely to drop in the second quarter because of the decline in fixed income. The UK's exit from the European Union and Donald Trump's surprise election win had been fuelling wagers on corporate bonds and the direction of interest rates over the past year, boosting Wall Street trading results. Those types of stimulants have been more scarce in recent months. Advertisement "There haven't been that many idiosyncratic events, and we need a few more of them," Ms Lake said. "As a sweeping generalisation, low rates, a more cautious outlook on rates, and low volatility have led to low client flows and a generally quiet, subdued and challenging trading environment." 'Cash but no conviction' In rates trading, clients are cautious because of conflicting signs from unemployment and inflation data, she said. In corporate bonds, "people have cash but no conviction" as spreads are tight. Equities, corporate derivatives and the prime brokerage were sources of strength in the quarter. "Client activities, which were more subdued in the first quarter, have in these first two months continued in a comparable fashion in the second quarter," David Solomon, Goldman Sachs's co-president, said at the same conference, declining to project the impact on the firm's revenue. At JPMorgan, the last three quarters of 2016 generated record trading revenue, so the comparisons this year are harder for traders to live up to, Lake said. "If I look to June, I don't see any particular reason for that to change," Ms Lake said. "But anything can happen in a month." Cost controls When it comes to mergers and acquisitions, uncertainties over European elections and US tax reform have led corporate executives to be cautious, Mr Solomon said. That's despite steady growth and a competitive environment that encourages CEOs to act. As a result, he expects a "reasonable pace" for deals, and said the environment has felt a little better in the past month or two than it did earlier in the year. Separately, analysts also asked about expense discipline. Goldman Sachs chief financial officer Marty Chavez, speaking at the same event as Mr Solomon, told investors that when the firm's revenue does climb, compensation will rise at a slower rate. Bank of America will take a charge of about $US300 million ($400,000) to speed up data-centre consolidation, and will report $US125 million in severance, about double what's typical, Mr Moynihan said. The expenses are part of the firm's goal of cutting total annual costs to $US53 billion by the end of 2018. "We're trying to accelerate opportunities, and so this quarter we'll do a couple things to push some stuff through and really position us to make that $US53 billion without a problem," he said.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 31 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman JPMorgan China Region Fund, Inc. Liquidation Progress BOSTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Following the announcement on May 15, 2017, the assets of JPMorgan China Region Fund, Inc. (‘JFC’ or the ‘Fund’) now comprise 99.4% cash having undertaken the liquidation of the majority of the investment portfolio and the repayment of any outstanding loans, all pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution described in and attached to the proxy statement. Of the cash holding, the breakdown as at May 30, 2017 was as follows:             Amount USD Equivalent   CNY 205,182,913 29,905,686 EUR 3,996 4,467 GBP 2,888 3,714 HKD 3,185,270 408,716 USD 98,944,698 98,944,698 Total 129,267,281   Any material changes to the JFC’s cash position will be announced as soon as practicable. As described in the proxy statement, JFC assets held through the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (‘QFII’) program may only be repatriated once approved by Chinese regulators, the timing of which is not known. These assets will be held in Renminbi until such time that approval is granted. As a result, stockholders will not receive the net asset value, less liquidation costs, for these assets in the liquidating distribution, and instead will receive an interest in a liquidating trust that is anticipated to make additional distributions to stockholders upon repatriation of amounts under the QFII program. It is our intention that proceeds paid in the liquidating distribution by the Fund will be treated as liquidation proceeds for non-US holders. This release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation to buy, nor shall there be any sale of Fund securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the laws of such state or jurisdiction. The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company whose shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The Fund trades under the symbol “JFC.” The Fund seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation through investments primarily in equity securities of companies with substantial assets in, or revenues derived from, the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau–collectively, the China Region. JPMorgan Fund Services, in Boston, MA is the Fund’s accounting and administrative agent.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad U.S. bank shares decline on trading revenue concerns By Reuters Published: 15:49 EDT, 31 May 2017 | Updated: 15:49 EDT, 31 May 2017 e-mail By Sinead Carew May 31 (Reuters) - Shares in U.S. banks fell on Wednesday, with the S&amp;P 500 bank index hitting its lowest level since late 2016, after JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America Corp warned of revenue weakness in the current quarter. The bank index fell as much as 2.34 percent. Bank of America and JPMorgan each fell more than 2 percent and were the biggest drags on the S&amp;P 500. Goldman Sachs , which is in the S&amp;P financial sector index, fell 3.7 percent after it gave a trading update. JPMorgan's trading revenue has fallen 15 percent so far in the second quarter, its chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, told investors at a conference. She would not provide a prediction for June. Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan, meanwhile, told investors the bank's second-quarter trading revenue would be lower than a year ago. "It's especially difficult because of the year-over-year comparison. The first and second quarter in 2016 were fairly busy on the trading front," said R.J. Grant, head of trading at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods in New York. Investors were disappointed that JPMorgan's CFO did not predict a turnaround for June, Grant said. "People are digging in for a bit of a slower summer here," he said. "If the big banks don't see anything on the horizon, then it potentially does not bode well for others. Volatility is non-existent. It's difficult to generate trading volumes or commissions or when the VIX is at historically low levels." The U.S. stock market's main gauge of investor anxiety closed at its lowest level in over two decades on May 8. The CBOE Volatility Index was up 4.8 percent at 10.88 on Wednesday. Goldman Sachs President David Solomon declined to give specifics about the bank´s trading business at an investor conference, but said subdued volatility - which depressed client activity in the first quarter - continued into April and May. JPMorgan shares were last down 2.5 percent at $81.84 after hitting their lowest level since Dec. 2, with trading volume 1.3 times the 10-day moving average. Bank of America shares were down 2.9 percent at $22.17 after earlier hitting a low of $22.09, also in heavy trading. Citigroup Corp was down 2 percent at $60.38 while Huntington Bancshares Inc was the second biggest percentage loser in the bank subsector with a 2.6 percent drop. Goldman Sachs shares hit their lowest point since late November and were last down 3.7 at $210.43 after hitting a low of $209.62. Trading volume in the stock was 1.8 times its 10-day moving average.

JPMorgan Just Broke the Financial Sector. JPMorgan Chase's revelation that trading volume is down from a year ago has caused bank stocks to drop today. By Ben Levisohn May 31, 2017 11:58 a.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large As JPMorgan Chase (JPM) goes, so goes the financial sector. Illustration: Agence France-Presse/Getty Images What do I mean? JPMorgan is so big, and operates across so many businesses, that it is often considered a bellwether for other banks stocks. That's true on the upside--remember when JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon made a big purchase of his company stock back in February 2016, signaling the market low?--but also true on the downside. And the revelation that JPMorgan's trading revenue is down 15% from a year ago, made at an industry conference today, has done just that--caused financial stocks to tumble. The Wall Street Journal's Emily Glazer reports: J.P. Morgan Chase JPM -2.06% & Co. finance chief Marianne Lake said the bank’s trading so far is down about 15% year-over-year though she won’t forecast for the coming quarter. Ms. Lake, speaking at an industry investor presentation Wednesday, said that is a “normal seasonal decline” for the markets business from the first quarter to the second quarter. That comment caused bank stocks that rely on trading for big chunk of their business--Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), and Morgan Stanley (MS), among them--to tumble. How bad are the drops? JPMorgan Chase has fallen 2% to $82.21 at 11:38 a.m. today, while Bank of America has dropped 2.5% to $22.26, Citigroup has slumped 2.5% to $60.11, and Morgan Stanley is off 2.2% at $41.33. The Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) has fallen 1.2% to $23.18, making financials the worst market sector today. And then there's Goldman Sachs. Its shares have tumbled 3.3% to $211.20, and its stock has broken its 200-day moving average: Illustration: FactSet That can't be good.

Chipmaker Analog Devices is up after its quarterly results were better than Wall Street had expected. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) BEIJING (AP) — Chinese stocks declined Thursday after a survey showed manufacturing weakening while other Asian markets gained after Wall Street fell for a second day. KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 percent to 3,102.21 while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 gained 1 percent to 19,854.27. Hong Kong's Hang Seng advanced 0.4 percent to 25,752.44 and Seoul's Kospi shed 0.1 percent to 2,344.29. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.2 percent to 5,733.90 and benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Southeast Asia also advanced. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks fell on a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for tech companies. That offset gains for drug makers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell after executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drug makers and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost less than 0.1 percent to 2,411.80. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.1 percent to 21,008.65. CHINESE MANUFACTURING: The Chinese business magazine Caixin said its purchasing managers' index declined for a third month, falling to 49.6 from April's 50.3 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity contracting. That came after a separate PMI on Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics and an industry group, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, improved to 54.5 from 54. "Yesterday's official PMI reading had hinted at growth having remained broadly stable last month," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. "But today's downbeat unofficial PMI suggests conditions may not have held up as well as previously thought." Get news headlines sent daily to your inbox Sign Up!

TRUMP AND CLIMATE: President Donald Trump was preparing to announce a decision on whether to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. Trump promoted his announcement Wednesday night on Twitter, after a day in which U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of a U.S. withdrawal. Trump himself kept everyone in suspense, saying he was still listening to "a lot of people both ways." Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement to fight global warming by reducing carbon emissions. Withdrawing would leave the United States aligned only with Russia among the world's industrialized economies. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. oil gained 38 cents to $48.70 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.34 on Wednesday to close at $48.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 40 cents to $51.16 in London. It dropped $1.48 the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 110.92 yen from Wednesday's 110.76. The euro edged down to $1.1244 from $1.1247. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Trump himself kept everyone in suspense, saying he was still listening to "a lot of people both ways." Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement to fight global warming by reducing carbon emissions. Withdrawing would leave the United States aligned only with Russia among the world's industrialized economies. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. oil gained 38 cents to $48.70 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.34 on Wednesday to close at $48.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 40 cents to $51.16 in London. It dropped $1.48 the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 110.92 yen from Wednesday's 110.76. The euro edged down to $1.1244 from $1.1247.

Chinese stocks declined Thursday after a survey showed manufacturing weakening while other Asian markets gained after Wall Street fell for a second day. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko) BEIJING — Global stock markets were mostly higher Thursday following Wall Street's decline while Chinese stocks fell after a survey showed manufacturing activity weakening. KEEPING SCORE: France's CAC-40 gained 0.5 per cent to 5,308.60 and Germany's DAX advanced 0.4 per cent to 12,660.42. London's FTSE 100 retreated 0.3 per cent to 7,543.86. On Wednesday, the DAX gained 0.1 per cent while the FTSE 100 shed 0.1 per cent and the CAC-40 lost 0.4 per cent. On Wall Street, futures for the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor's 500 index were up just under 0.1 per cent. ASIA'S DAY: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 per cent to 3,102.62 while Tokyo's Nikkei 225 advanced 1.1 per cent to 19,860.03. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.5 per cent to 25,779.34 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 added 0.2 per cent to 5,738.10. South Korea's Kospi shed 0.1 per cent to 2,344.61 and India's Sensex was unchanged at 31,155.89. Benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Singapore rose while Bangkok retreated. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks fell on a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for tech companies. That offset gains for drug makers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell after executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drug makers and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The S&P 500 lost less than 0.1 per cent to 2,411.80. The Dow dropped 0.1 per cent to 21,008.65. CHINESE MANUFACTURING: The Chinese business magazine Caixin said its purchasing managers' index declined for a third month, falling to 49.6 from April's 50.3 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity contracting. That came after a separate PMI on Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics and an industry group, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, improved to 54.5 from 54. ANALYST'S TAKE: "Today's PMI reading points to growth having slowed more rapidly last month than the official PMI initially suggested," said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. Reasons for the conflicting readings were unclear, but one possibility is that Caixin's survey includes more small or private companies than the official measure. "The latest data are still consistent with our broader outlook on the Chinese economy," said Evans-Pritchard. "We have long been warning that the rebound in growth during the second half of last year would prove short-lived." TRUMP AND CLIMATE: President Donald Trump was preparing to announce whether he will pull the United States out of the 195-nation Paris agreement to combat global warming by reducing carbon emissions. U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of an American withdrawal. On Twitter, Trump said he still was listening to "a lot of people both ways." Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement. KOREA TRADE: May exports rose 13.4 per cent over a year earlier but growth decelerated from April. Exports are forecast to maintain relatively robust growth this year, possibly helped by the release of a new Samsung smartphone model. But they also face potential risks from rising pressure in the United States and Europe for restrictions on imports, as well as possible slowing Chinese growth. INDIAN MANUFACTURING: A survey showed Indian manufacturing activity grew in May but more slowly than April. A purchasing managers' index declined to 51.6 from April's six-month high of 52.5 on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 show activity expanding. The measures for output and new orders declined but stayed well above 50. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. oil gained 48 cents to $48.80 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract plunged $1.34 on Wednesday to close at $48.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, advanced 45 cents to $51.21 in London. It dropped $1.48 the previous session. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 110.95 yen from Wednesday's 110.76. The euro edged down to $1.1246 from $1.1247.       E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article           Story Tools   E-mail this Article Print this Article Share this Article   Font: * * * * *   Image: * * * *       A man talks on his mobile phone in front of an electronic stock board showing Japan's Nikkei 225 index at a securities firm Thursday, June 1, 2017, in Tokyo.

Wall Street is gripping for a double-digit drop in second-quarter trading revenue as one of its biggest businesses, bond trading, suffers from tranquil markets and the Federal Reserve’s easy-money policies. JPMorgan Chase, the biggest bank in the US, is bracing for a 15-percent slide in bond trading — in part because optimism on Wall Street about President Trump’s tax-cutting agenda has kept markets so stable. “There’s not a lot to trade around right now,” Maryanne Lake, the Chief Financial Officer at JPMorgan Chase, said at an industry conference on Wednesday as she revealed the glum forecast. JPMorgan isn’t the only bank preparing for a dip. Bank of America will likely see a 10- to 12-percent dip in trading revenues, hurt in part by lower interest rates, Brian Moynihan, CEO of Bank of America, said at the conference. The news sent bank stocks down for the day. JPMorgan was off 2 percent by early afternoon, to $82.24. BofA shares fell 2.5 percent, to $22.25. Shares of Goldman Sachs, which suffered a disastrous quarter in the beginning of the year because of its weak bond trading, fell 3 percent, to $211.84. Market shocks are good for the trading business, since that gives traders a reason to buy bonds off spooked investors, then turn around and sell them to bullish ones. But with corporate profits rising, a strong labor market, and economic confidence near all-time highs, the bond market has been dry as dust. “There haven’t been that many idiosyncratic events, and we need a few more of them,” Lake added. Last year, banks saw a boost in trading late in the quarter thanks to the surprise results from the UK vote to leave the European Union. Last year, Lake said that there had been a “spike” in trading thanks to the “Brexit.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under bank of america ,  goldman sachs ,  jpmorgan chase ,  trading ,  wall street Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next City to cut ties with Wells Fargo after fake-account scand...

Bloomberg News reports that fixed-income trading is down for the first two months of the period and equities are up “slightly,” Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said Wednesday at an investor conference in New York. Lake said she doesn’t see any particular reason those trends would change in June. Revenue from the world’s biggest investment banks is likely to drop in the second quarter, ending a rebound in fixed income, analysts at New York-based JPMorgan said this month. The U.K.’s exit from the European Union and Donald Trump’s surprise election win fueled more wagers on corporate bonds and the direction of interest rates over the past year, boosting Wall Street trading revenue.

Vanity Fair hive Sign In/Up business technology politics the players hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Magazine Search Business Politics Technology The Players Sign In/Up From the Magazine How Wells Fargo’s Cutthroat Corporate Culture Allegedly Drove Bankers… Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER From the Magazine How Wells Fargo’s Cutthroat Corporate Culture Allegedly Drove Bankers to Fraud Most Americans have assumed their bank accounts are sacrosanct. But with the major scandal unfolding at Wells Fargo, angry former employees illuminate the alarming pressure that allegedly led local bankers to defraud perhaps more than a million customers. by Bethany McLeanSummer 2017 Email Facebook Twitter BREAKING THE BANK Former Wells Fargo executives, from top: Carrie Tolstedt, head of Community Banking; C.E.O. Dick Kovacevich; and his successor, John Stumpf. Photo Illustration by Cristiana Couceiro. Once upon a time, in 1970, long before America’s banking system was dominated by six giant institutions—JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley—Dennis Hambek started working as a messenger at the National Bank of Washington in Ellensburg, Washington. Over the years, as his career advanced from messenger to loan officer to branch manager, he had a front-row seat at the transformation of America’s banking system. That first year, the National Bank of Washington was swallowed up by Pacific National Bank of Seattle, which in 1981 was bought by Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp, which in 1996 was bought by San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, which in 1999—as the consolidation frenzy was reaching its peak—merged with Norwest, a Minneapolis-based bank, in a $34 billion deal. Wells Fargo, which was founded in 1852 as a stagecoach express to carry valuable goods to and from the gold mines in the West, had a storied brand, so the new, combined company kept that name. But if Norwest’s name didn’t survive, its corporate culture did. Spearheaded by the company’s then C.E.O., Dick Kovacevich, it involved a novel way of thinking about banking. As Kovacevich told me in a 1998 profile of him I wrote for Fortune magazine, the key question facing banks was “How do you sell money?” His answer was that financial instruments—A.T.M. cards, checking accounts, credit cards, loans—were consumer products, no different from, say, screwdrivers sold by Home Depot. In Kovacevich’s lingo, bank branches were “stores,” and bankers were “salespeople” whose job was to “cross-sell,” which meant getting “customers”—not “clients,” but “customers”—to buy as many products as possible. “It was his business model,” says a former Norwest executive. “It was a religion. It very much was the culture.” It was underpinned by the financial reality that customers who had, say, lines of credit and savings accounts with the bank were far more profitable than those who just had checking accounts. In 1997, prior to Norwest’s merger with Wells Fargo, Kovacevich launched an initiative called “Going for Gr-Eight,” which meant getting the customer to buy eight products from the bank. The reason for eight? “It rhymes with GREAT!” he said. This slogan, however, as experienced by bankers on the ground such as Hambek, was more hard-core than hokey. “We had a lot of longtime customers and a good staff, but the sales pressure kept mounting, mounting, mounting,” Hambek says. “Every morning, we had a conference call with all the managers. You were supposed to tell them how you were going to make your sales goal for the day, and if you didn’t, you’d have to call in the afternoon to explain why you didn’t make it and how you were going to fix it. It was really tense.” Achieving sales goals wasn’t easy. Ellensburg is a small town, and there were seven other banks. VIDEO: Preet Bharara on Policing Wall Street, the Mob, and More That’s when Hambek began to see things that shouldn’t have been happening: bankers persuading customers to take out large loans and then immediately repay part of them so that the banker could get credit for the bigger loan, for instance. In the summer of 2005, a customer named Bill Moore complained to Hambek about a checking account and a savings account—that he had been given but hadn’t asked for and didn’t want. Hambek investigated and discovered that the banker who opened them had entered Moore’s driver’s-license number as “MOOREWF00000” and the date of issuance as January 1, 2000, a holiday when the Washington State Department of Licensing would have been closed, as shown by documents first obtained by Vice News. “Gaming,” which was defined in the Wells Fargo Code of Ethics as “the manipulation and/or misrepresentation of sales or referrals . . . in an attempt to receive compensation or to meet sales goals,” was supposed to be a big no-no, so Hambek called the Wells Fargo EthicsLine, and he told his supervisor what he’d found. “I said, ‘This is blatant gaming,’ ” he recalls, but nobody seemed to care. Later that summer, after 35 years of service, he retired in order to avoid being fired for lack of productivity. INSIDE WELLS, THE ATTITUDE WAS “DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO, BUT DON’T GET CAUGHT.” Twitter On December 27, 2005, Hambek sent a letter via certified mail to Carrie Tolstedt, who had become the head of regional banking at Wells Fargo in 2002. In the letter, which would have been passed on to the bank’s legal department, he described the gaming he’d witnessed, and told her that employees were leaving. “It would behoove someone to survey these employees as to the true reason they left the company.” He added, “Upper management is also aware of this, as is the ethics line, yet no action has been taken.” Hambek never got a response to his letter. (Wells Fargo had no comment on this matter.) In the ensuing decade, the big banks got even bigger. Wells Fargo swallowed up Wachovia during the financial crisis, to become the country’s third-largest bank by assets, and its soaring stock made it worth almost $300 billion. John Stumpf, a native Minnesotan who could have played a modern George Bailey, took over as C.E.O. when Kovacevich retired, at the end of 2007. He, like Kovacevich, repeatedly cited Wells Fargo’s success at cross-selling as a reason investors should value the bank’s stock—and they believed. “In the eyes of Wall Street, Wells has always been a cut above,” says one longtime bank investor. Unlike the other big banks, it positioned itself as “the bank of the real economy,” i.e., its major business was retail banking for everyday folks, not trading or investment banking for sophisticated investors. It helped that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has long been the bank’s biggest shareholder. Don’t Bank on It But the pretty picture masked a dark reality. On September 8, 2016, Wells Fargo agreed to pay a combined $185 million penalty to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (C.F.P.B.), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the City and County of Los Angeles to settle charges from all three that, as the C.F.P.B. put it, there had been “fraudulent conduct . . . on a massive scale.” (As part of the agreement Wells Fargo admitted no wrongdoing.) Wells Fargo’s own analysis found that between 2011 and 2015 its employees had opened more than 1.5 million deposit accounts and more than 565,000 credit-card accounts that may not have been authorized. Some customers were charged fees on accounts they didn’t know they had, and some customers had collection agencies calling them due to unpaid fees on accounts they didn’t know existed. Gaming was so widespread that it had even spawned related terms, such as “pinning,” which meant assigning customers personal-identification numbers, or PINs, without their knowledge in order to impersonate them on Wells Fargo computers and enroll them in various products without their knowledge. The fraud was not only big, but blatant, with 193,000 non-employee accounts opened between 2011 and 2015 for which the only e-mail domain name listed was @wellsfargo.com, according to the Los Angeles city attorney’s office. In light of all this, the $185 million fine was a pittance—less than Tolstedt and Stumpf had made in the previous five years and a mere 3 percent of second-quarter profits. And Wells, which also announced that it had fired some 1,000 mainly junior employees for gaming, clearly thought it had disposed of a nuisance issue. But that was hardly the end of it. Suddenly Wells Fargo employees, such as Hambek, came forward in droves, and America got mad in a way that we hadn’t over other financial scandals. “I think the public expects international financial banks to lose billions in nefarious ways,” says Isaac Boltansky, the director of policy research at Compass Point, a prominent boutique investment bank. “But learning that the American checking account has been co-opted has insidious wrinkles. This is supposed to be one of the most trusted things in the world.” At congressional hearings in which John Stumpf’s appealing midwestern diffidence suddenly seemed like appalling arrogance, representatives from both sides of the aisle let loose. “Fraud is fraud. Theft is theft,” thundered Texas Republican congressman Jeb Hensarling, “and what happened at Wells Fargo over the course of many years cannot be described any other way.” “You haven’t returned a single nickel of your personal earnings,” Hensarling’s ideological opposite number, Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, told Stumpf. “You haven’t fired a single senior executive. Instead evidently your definition of accountable is to push the blame to your low-level employees.” Now Wells Fargo is facing a plethora of ongoing investigations by various authorities, including criminal probes by the Justice Department and the California attorney general. The latter has requested not just the identity of the Wells Fargo employees who might have “used the unlawfully obtained [PINs] to commit false impersonation and identity theft,” according to a search warrant first made public by the Los Angeles Times, but also “the managers of the identified employees . . . [including] branch managers, area managers, and regional managers.” “People want to trust their banks, and Wells has brought mistrust to the table,” says one longtime investor. So how is it that Dick Kovacevich’s beautiful strategy went so horribly wrong? VIDEO: Bernie Madoff’s Victims Speak Out Almost 15 years before the scandal became front-page news, in 2002, Wells Fargo’s internal investigations unit had noticed an uptick in what they called “sales integrity” cases. “Whether real or perceived, team members . . . feel they cannot make sales goals without gaming the system,” an investigator wrote in a report dated August 2004. “The incentive to cheat is based on the fear of losing their jobs.” The report recommended that Wells consider reducing or eliminating sales goals, as several peer banks had done, and warned that the issue could lead to “loss of business and . . . diminished reputation in the community.” There was no follow-up. The list of employees who complained is long and reaches back well over a decade. In March of 2008, just around the time the financial crisis was getting into full swing, Yesenia Guitron was hired as a personal banker at Wells Fargo’s St. Helena branch, in California’s Napa Valley. The sole provider for her two children, she had heard negative things about the environment at Wells, but she didn’t have many options. “The economy had shut down,” she recalls. “I needed the job.” Guitron soon discovered there was no shortage of internal publications that advised Wells employees on how to conduct themselves, including the Wells Fargo Code of Ethics and the Wells Fargo Team Member Handbook, which warned if an employee engaged in “manipulating or misrepresenting sales [gaming] in an attempt to meet sales goals or receive compensation” immediate termination could result. But soon after she was hired, Guitron saw a different reality. “I realized why all the other bankers had left,” she says. The pressure was intense. There were “morning huddle” meetings to discuss “Daily Solutions,” or sales goals for the day, and a manager would do hourly check-ins to see if each banker was making progress toward his or her quota, which in 2008 was eight products per day. (The number was increased in 2010 to 8.5.) “Call nights” were scheduled after the branch closed to “help” bankers who were having trouble meeting their sales goals, which were challenging in St. Helena. According to an analysis that was done for a lawsuit Guitron later filed, there were only about 11,500 potential customers in the area, and 11 other financial institutions. The quotas for the bankers at Guitron’s branch totaled 12,000 Daily Solutions each year, including almost 3,000 new checking accounts. Without fraud, the math didn’t work. “ALL THE TELLERS KNEW [OF THE FRAUDS], BUT . . . PEOPLE NEEDED THE JOB.” Twitter Guitron says that customers began coming to her, complaining about getting mail from Wells Fargo on accounts or services that they had never authorized. “People knew me and knew I could fix the problems,” she says. A common denominator, according to Guitron, was that most of the customers were Spanish-speaking, like her, so they didn’t feel comfortable going to management in English. “All the tellers and staff knew it, but no one else would complain,” Guitron says. “People needed the job. So did I, but I knew right from wrong.” On September 19, 2008, she sent an e-mail to her branch manager. “I have come across instances where I’ve opened accounts and shortly after they are closed and new sets of accounts are opened,” she wrote. “I find NO banker notes to explain why this is happening. I am very concerned as I know this to be GAMING!!!” She collected approximately 300 printouts of accounts that were problematic in various ways, she says, such as a minor having more than a dozen accounts. But, according to Guitron in legal documents, her manager would say only, “It’s a misunderstanding.” Or “You need to mind your own business.” Nothing changed, so Guitron requested meetings with more senior executives. Overall, she claimed that during her tenure at Wells Fargo she raised concerns on more than 100 occasions, including about a dozen calls to the Wells Fargo EthicsLine, and on no fewer than 37 occasions she provided records that supported her complaints. Guitron alleges that her managers began to retaliate, making it harder for her to meet her sales goals. She was fired in January 2010. In 2011, Guitron, along with another employee, Judi Klosek, who had made similar complaints, filed a whistle-blower lawsuit. The account printouts Guitron had collected were filed with the court, as were depositions from many other Wells Fargo employees. To cite but two: Irene Perez, who was the lead teller at the St. Helena branch from 2008 to 2011, claimed, “Everyone at the branch . . . was aware of the unethical conduct of bankers.” “It was normal business practices to use false identification on accounts and to change customers’ names and open new accounts,” said Dreydy Metelin, another personal banker at the branch, in her deposition. “Management made it clear that no employee was allowed to complain about the unethical practices that were going on within the branch.” Morally Bankrupt In 2012, the court ruled in Wells Fargo’s favor, mainly because Wells presented “clear and convincing evidence” that Guitron had, in fact, failed to meet her sales goals, so she would have been fired anyway. She appealed and lost again on the same basis. Her legal bills were more than $42,000, but the court reduced them to $18,675.70 based in part on the “significant difference between Wells Fargo’s resources and Guitron’s ability to pay.” (Wells Fargo would not comment on this matter.) Julie Tishkoff, an administrative assistant to a Wells Fargo regional president, said, according to her discrimination complaint, that around the same time, in 2005, she observed “fraudulent banking practices,” including bank employees’ “forging customer signatures and fraudulent[ly] opening accounts for customers without their knowledge or consent” and soliciting elderly or otherwise vulnerable customers to take out lines of credit even though they didn’t understand the product. Inevitably, customers began to sue, too. In the fall of 2013, David Douglas filed a lawsuit against Wells Fargo and three local employees, alleging that Wells bankers had opened eight accounts he didn’t want or know about, funding them with money from his legitimate accounts. Douglas contacted a Wells Fargo fraud investigator, who assured him they would look into it—but no one ever got back to him. His lawyer, Michael Kade, is currently also representing nine former Wells Fargo employees in a suit against the bank due to go to trial in the fall. The lawsuits continued to pile up, and a journalist finally noticed. In December 2013, E. Scott Reckard, then a reporter at the Los Angeles Times, wrote an article titled “Wells Fargo’s Pressure-Cooker Sales Culture Comes at a Cost.” He made the point that the “relentless pressure to sell has battered employee morale and led to ethical breaches, customer complaints and labor lawsuits.” The article caught the eye of Mike Feuer, a Harvard-trained lawyer and politician who had become the Los Angeles city attorney. He was shocked by the revelations in the piece, but he didn’t have subpoena power. So he asked his staff to investigate by doing what he calls “good old-fashioned detective work”—conducting dozens of interviews with current and former Wells Fargo employees and customers, going through court documents, and searching the C.F.P.B. and Federal Trade Commission consumer-complaint databases. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (O.C.C.), which is Wells Fargo’s regulator, also started to get complaints from customers and employees. One of the plaintiffs, Yasmeen Fasheh, began working at a Wells branch in Los Angeles in the spring of 2000. She alleged in a recently filed lawsuit that the pressure to cross-sell resulted in employees’ “impersonating customers” on Wells Fargo computers in order to enroll them in services without their consent, and selling to older customers on the belief that they wouldn’t review their bank statements. She alleged that she finally contacted Lefky Mansi, Wells’s longtime area president for Los Angeles. “You’re just a little ant in the company,” Fasheh alleges he responded. “If I’m going down, you’re going down, as well.” She called human resources too, which, she claims, told her “they were aware that these practices were occurring throughout the company, but there was nothing they could do.” (Wells Fargo declined to comment.) The Names of the Games Ken Mac, who worked at Wells Fargo’s Arcadia, California, branch over the summer of 2013, calls his brief stint at Wells “the lowest point of my life.” Mac, a fluent Chinese speaker, says that he got an elderly Chinese woman to sign up for a credit card she didn’t want by telling her “it was confirmation that she stopped by to update her address. I felt sick in my stomach,” he says, “but it was a tough economy, and I was worried, if I lost this job, I would be in a tough financial situation.” Ivan Rodriguez worked at three Wells Fargo branches in California, starting in 2007, and was quickly promoted to be a banker. There was pressure right away, but he knew he was in a sales job, and he thought, It is what it is. But he saw things: bankers changing customers’ phone numbers in the system so, if they complained, no one could get in touch with them; online banking accounts for elderly customers who didn’t know how to use computers. But the worst, he says, was the shredding. In order to get a signature on an account a customer didn’t want, bankers would cut a signature out of an existing account, scan that through, and then shred the evidence. They never got caught, because, in the branches he worked at, the manager would get 24 hours’ notice before Wells Fargo’s auditors came through. Indeed, according to a Wall Street Journal story, the advance notice that auditors were coming was common among Wells’s roughly 6,000 branches; more than a dozen employees told the Journal they’d either forged or seen colleagues forge signatures or shred the papers. (Wells Fargo has said it would eliminate the 24-hour notice of auditor visits.) On May 4, 2015, after his investigators had worked the case for 16 months, Feuer, the L.A. city attorney, filed a civil enforcement case against Wells. In the days following, his office got calls and e-mails from more than a thousand Wells Fargo customers and current and former employees describing a “veritable litany of horrific experiences,” as Jim Clark, Feuer’s chief deputy, put it to Congress. “Anecdotally, the feeling is that everyone knew,” says Jonathan Delshad, a lawyer who has filed a case on behalf of former Wells Fargo employees, and who says that more than 800 people have called his firm. “The better they did at sales, the more they advanced, so it got spread across the company. An entire generation of managers thrived in the culture, got rewarded for it, and are now in positions of power.” “AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF MANAGERS THRIVED IN THE CULTURE . . . AND ARE NOW IN POSITIONS OF POWER.” Twitter Delshad’s conclusion is echoed in a report done by Wells Fargo’s independent board members, which was released on April 10. “To many employees, the route to success was selling more than your peers,” the report stated. Even after the L.A. Times story, there were no dramatic changes. “What has mystified everybody and anybody, what other bank managements have asked me, is why, when the L.A. Times story hit, did you not rip the place apart and find out who was pushing these practices?” asks Nancy Bush, a bank analyst who has covered Wells Fargo for over three decades. The potential for problems was inherent in the strategy Dick Kovacevich created. Or, as Dennis Hambek says, “I think what Dick Kovacevich implemented was John Stumpf’s downfall.” Kovacevich was a larger-than-life C.E.O. As a Stanford baseball player, he sustained a shoulder injury that thwarted his plan to play in the major leagues. Instead, he earned an M.B.A. and started his career selling consumer products such as toys for General Mills. In the mid-1970s, he was recruited by Walter Wriston, of Citicorp, where he helped change the face of banking by rolling out Citi’s then revolutionary A.T.M.’s. But he was passed over for the top consumer job and was lured to Norwest in 1986. Looking back, a longtime Wells analyst says he is struck by the “enigma” that was Kovacevich. He exuded midwestern values, and in 1993, the year he became C.E.O., he began publishing the Wells Fargo Vision & Values, which featured such homilies as “In hiring, we really don’t care how much a person knows until we know how much they care.” But he also called financial services “the ultimate team sport,” and was extraordinarily intense and aggressive—even arrogant to some. “He was one of the most competitive people I have ever known,” says an executive who used to play tennis with him. “We were evenly matched, but he would win because winning was more important to him than it was to me—and I am competitive!” Although Kovacevich stressed ethics, he also said the most important metric of success was revenue growth. But calling a client a customer and a branch a store had a dark side, as the former executive points out, because it implicitly downgrades the bank’s level of responsibility toward its clients. Yet Kovacevich argued that “when customers vote with their pocket books, we know we’re doing something right.” Stumpf was a different character, more affable than arrogant. “If you were writing a movie script, this is not the guy you would want to play the villain,” says longtime banking analyst Mike Mayo. Stumpf was Minnesotan, through and through. He grew up on a farm, one of 11 children, and after college he worked as a repo man. “What got John most excited was talking about his days as a repo man,” says an investor who knows him well. “He has these vivid stories of repossessing cars while another guy would be the lookout guy.” Unlike Kovacevich, who would tell his executives, “The only thing I want to hear is bad news,” Stumpf seemed to be proud that the culture was one of “Minnesota nice.” He “was not perceived within Wells Fargo as someone who wanted to hear bad news or deal with conflict,” noted the board report. H.R. KNEW “THESE PRACTICES WERE OCCURRING . . . BUT [SAID] THERE WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO.” Twitter Nor was he the kind of C.E.O. to question Dick Kovacevich’s script. Indeed, he appropriated much of it. When asked why Wells Fargo had a cross-selling goal of eight, he’d say, “The answer is: it rhymed with ‘great!’ ” He was liked by investors—what wasn’t to like?—but for better and worse, he didn’t have the presence that Kovacevich had had. He was less self-aggrandizing, but he also seemed to some to be more of a big-picture C.E.O. than one who was enmeshed in the dirty minutiae of operations. “I never felt he had a detailed grip on the intricacies of the business,” says an investor. “There was nothing remarkable about the guy,” says another investor. “I always thought [until the scandal] that he was dealt a really good hand.” Paradoxically the hard-core sales culture seemed to intensify once Stumpf took over. In 2010, both the compensation and performance ratings systems were rejiggered so that they were associated with sales goals. Bankers, branch managers, and district managers risked pay cuts and poor performance reviews if they didn’t hit the goals, noted the board report, and employees were ranked against one another. The pressure was greatest in California, Arizona, and Florida. Pam Conboy, who ran Wells’s Arizona regional banking from 2007 to 2017 and who had taken Arizona from last place to first in sales rankings, gave a presentation at a 2010 leadership conference in which she encouraged the use of “morning huddles” to discuss the previous day’s sales reports, and told district managers they should call to check on branches multiple times a day. Another executive, named Shelley Freeman, who ran the Los Angeles region until 2009, and then Florida, would have district managers “run the gauntlet”: each would have to dress up in a themed costume and run down the line to a whiteboard to report the number of sales they had achieved. According to the board report, on a per-employee basis, the reports of sales-practice misconduct tripled from the second quarter of 2007 through the fourth quarter of 2013. Kovacevich told someone who knows him that he would never have tolerated this treatment of employees, which he has described as “harassment.” He has called the issues during his tenure “infinitesimal.” Job Wells Done Stumpf had risen through the ranks, and so did Carrie Tolstedt, the daughter of a baker who had started her career at Norwest in Nebraska, in 1986. She and Stumpf were a symbiotic pair. Tolstedt wasn’t flashy either, and impressed investors as a detail-oriented, hardworking operator; a former Wells executive says she “worked 16 hours a day, 7 days a week.” Stumpf’s support for her was extraordinary. He thought “she was the ‘most brilliant’ Community Banker he had ever met,” the board report noted. In return she delivered the numbers he wanted to see. Tolstedt told investors that customers who had five products with Wells Fargo were three times as profitable as those with three products, while those with eight products were five times as profitable. Additionally, the more accounts a customer had, the less likely it was that he or she would switch to another bank paying higher rates of interest. One investor argues that was a key reason that Wells, for years, had a lower cost of funds than its peers. This was a critical advantage because it allowed Wells to price loans lower than other big banks could and still make the same profit. Said Warren Buffett in a 2009 interview, “The key to the future of Wells is continuing to get the money in at very low costs.” Wells’s stock price soared, and Tolstedt, whose salary was $1.75 million, received more than $20 million in annual bonuses from 2010 to 2015, which was justified in part by the “record cross-sell results” in her division, said Wells in its financial filings. But Stumpf and the rest of the executive team, and soon the board, knew there were issues. It wasn’t just the press and the Los Angeles city attorney. In 2011, a group of bankers who were terminated for sales violations wrote a letter to Stumpf, arguing that their actions had not only been condoned by management in their branch, but that similar things were happening across the bank. Multiple task forces were convened. Lisa Stevens, who became the head of the West Coast region in 2010 and reported directly to Tolstedt, was complaining by 2012 to the bank’s corporate chief risk officer, Mike Loughlin, about “unrealistic sales goals and her frustration with Community Bank leadership,” according to the board report. Wells did take some small steps, and by at least some measures, the sales problem did begin improving in 2013. But Wells’s response was incremental, not Draconian. One explanation is that executives failed to see the scope of the problem because of the way Wells Fargo was structured. Kovacevich had always run the company in a decentralized way, so much so that he’d refer to himself as a “C.E.O. of C.E.O.’s.” Functions such as risk management, legal, and human resources were not run at the corporate level, and employees reported to, say, the head of Community Banking, or the head of Wells’s much smaller business bank. This meant that Tolstedt, in effect, had her own empire, with her own risk-management head, Claudia Russ Anderson, reporting to her, rather than to anyone at the corporate level. For corporate executives, the structural difficulty of seeing inside the retail bank was complicated by Tolstedt herself. “She is widely viewed as building a community bank and making it a business success—and it was,” says one person who is familiar with Wells Fargo. “But by all accounts she was mercurial, very wary of others, and apparently not the type that wanted bad news to surface.” She viewed the sales model as the key to the community bank’s success, and didn’t want to take any steps that might “impede its operation,” noted the board report, which also alleged she was “obsessed with control.” For instance, when Tolstedt found out that Lisa Stevens had been complaining, she told Stevens to “toe the line.” (Tolstedt declined to comment for this article.) It’s convenient now to place the blame on Tolstedt and on Wells’s model, but that’s not the whole truth. Kovacevich, for his part, noted to someone who knows him that the fact that Stevens was complaining was proof that the decentralized model worked. It’s just that no one in leadership wanted to hear it, or as the board report noted, “Many observers expressed their belief that Tolstedt operated the Community Bank in the way she did because she thought Stumpf would approve.” And he did, wholeheartedly. After Feuer filed his suit, Stumpf sent an e-mail to another executive. “I have worked over the weekend with Carrie on the LA issue—I really feel for Carrie and her team,” he wrote. “We do such a good job in this area. I will fight this one to the finish. Do you know only around 1% of our people lose their jobs [for] gaming the system . . . . Did some do things wrong —you bet and that is called life. This is not systemic.” Relying on the statistic that only 1 percent of employees were being fired annually is an easy way to minimize the problem, because it’s a measure of one thing only: the people who got caught. It didn’t represent those who encouraged gaming, or those who were fired for lack of production, or those who just left because they disapproved of the culture, like Rodriguez. The turnover at the lower levels of the community bank ran at 30 percent to 40 percent annually. Inside Wells, says lawyer Jonathan Delshad, the attitude was “Do what you have to do, but don’t get caught.” After the 2013 Los Angeles Times article, the board, at least according to its own report, got involved. Initially, they believed the problem was relatively small and was being addressed. After Feuer’s office filed its lawsuit in 2015, members of the risk committee asked for another presentation on sales-practice issues. It is unclear who was involved in the presentation, but board members left with the impression that only about 200 to 300 people in Southern California had been terminated. Multiple board members later complained to investigators that they felt “misled.” “MANAGEMENT MADE IT CLEAR THAT NO EMPLOYEE WAS ALLOWED TO COMPLAIN.” Twitter By the end of the year, two directors had told Stumpf over dinner that Tolstedt should go. Finally, on July 12, 2016, Wells announced that she would retire at the end of the year. Stumpf called her a “standard-bearer of our culture, a champion for our customers, and a role model for responsible, principled and inclusive leadership.” Because she was retiring, not being fired, her stock in the company, accumulated over her years at Wells Fargo, was expected to be worth up to $124 million. But if Wells could ignore its employees and its customers, and placate its board, its regulators were a different matter. Less than a week after the announcement that Tolstedt would retire, the O.C.C. sent a confidential letter to Stumpf, along with a report on its findings, which concluded that “the Bank’s sales practices were unethical; the Bank’s actions caused harm to consumers; and Bank management had not responded promptly to address these issues.” The O.C.C. had begun coordinating with Feuer’s office, and the C.F.P.B. also joined the fray. In early September they announced the joint $185 million settlement. Newly Minted? There may be no greater testament to the level of delusion inside Wells Fargo than the fact that executives were completely shocked by the outpouring of rage. Finally, Wells announced that it would do what it had long been unwilling to do: eliminate all product sales goals in retail banking. On October 12, as the outcry intensified, Stumpf announced he’d step down as C.E.O., and forfeit $41 million. After its investigation, the board stripped him of another $28 million and clawed back $19 million from Tolstedt. After concluding its report, they stripped her of another $47.3 million. (A lawyer for Tolstedt said, “We strongly disagree with the report and its attempt to lay blame with Ms. Tolstedt. A full and fair examination of the facts will produce a different conclusion.”) A handful of other executives, including Claudia Russ Anderson, Pam Conboy, and Shelley Freeman, were fired. Wells Fargo’s new C.E.O. is Tim Sloan, who spent most of his career not in the retail bank working with consumers but rather catering to big business clients before becoming C.F.O. and then C.O.O. Sloan is clearly not a break with the past, but, as a former Wells Fargo executive says, “he is a very different guy” from Stumpf. “No one has ever seen John Stumpf angry, and I literally can’t remember ever hearing him swear,” this person says. “Tim is much more hard-core.” Already, Sloan has made many changes. Functions such as human resources are being centralized at headquarters, so information can be dissected in multiple ways. Cross-selling, it seems, has become a dirty phrase. Wells now talks about “Mutual Value Exchange,” which seems to boil down to providing products that customers actually want and use. Wall Street isn’t sure what to think. Wells Fargo’s stock has regained the $30 billion it lost, which is as much a sign of optimism about deregulation in the new administration as anything. But “we gave them too much credit for being Superman in the banking industry,” says one major investor. “Now the cape has come off, and Wall Street is realizing they are just like everyone else and no better than anyone else.” Regardless of what happens, the story still tells an uncomfortable tale of how business, not just the business of banking, but all business, all too often works in the modern era. “I’m a notary,” Yesenia Guitron tells me. “I can only charge $10 for my services. But I’m told that, if I failed to take someone’s proper identification when I’m notarizing something for them, I could go to jail for 10 years.” How, she wonders, can you square the large consequences she’d have to face for a small misdeed for which she was paid a small amount with the small consequences for large-scale wrongdoing where the people in charge earned fortunes? The short answer is you can’t.

But the international fraud empire he built over the course of two decades, in which he offered phony high-interest certificates of deposit at a bank he started in Antigua, imploded. He was charged with 13 counts of wire and mail fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering and sentenced to 110 years in prison without parole.Photo: Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Stanford). MATHEW MARTOMA Over the course of several days in July of 2008, Mathew Martoma sealed his fate. That was when the former S.A.C. Capital portfolio manager allegedly used inside information about a clinical trial for Alzheimer’s drugs to bring in a windfall for his firm. Martoma was one of about 85 individuals who were either convicted of or pleaded guilty in the ensuing investigation that rocked Wall Street, though Martoma’s 9-year sentence was on the harsher side. A judge ruled that he also had to forfeit nearly $9.5 million in bonuses he received while working at S.A.C. in 2008, including the Boca Raton home he bought for $2 million.Photo: Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Splash News (Martoma). SAGE KELLY By Wall Street standards, Sage Kelly had it all: a cushy, $7 million-a-year gig running Jefferies’s health-care investment-banking unit, a home in Sag Harbor, a growing family, and a group of buddies to pal around with. But it all came crashing down when his wife filed for divorce, alleging in court papers that they had engaged in a foursome with clients and that he would often take so many drugs that he would pee all over their home. Jefferies denied all of the allegations and Kelly’s wife later recanted the statements, but the banker found himself out of a job for two years.Photo: Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Splash News (Kelly). BRUNO IKSIL Bruno Iksil earned himself the moniker the “London Whale” for a $6.2 billion trading loss he made on J.P. Morgan’s ledger in 2012. The Frenchman, who contends that his risky trades were made at the behest of his superiors, avoided any sort of prosecution. But the bank was subject to government probes and $900 million in regulatory fines, and its C.E.O., Jamie Dimon, took a 50 percent pay cut.Photo: Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Iksil). PreviousNext MARTHA STEWART The domestic doyenne, known primarily for teaching a whole class of homemakers the virtues of a perfectly-timed soufflé or a perfectly-folded sheet, imperfectly found herself in the Big House for five months in 2004, after she was convicted for conspiracy and obstruction of justice related to selling shares of drugmaker ImClone Systems. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From NBC/Getty Images (Stewart). MARTIN SHKRELI The so-called “pharma-bro” created a national media frenzy when he hiked the price of a lifesaving drug by 5,000 percent overnight in 2015, and continued to fan the flames by buying a $2 million single-copy Wu-Tang Clan album and picking fights with presidential candidates. In the midst of the firestorm, he also got arrested and charged with 8 counts of fraud after prosecutors accusing him of using a public drug company he ran as a personal piggybank to pay back investors whose money he lost at his now-defunct hedge funds. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Shkreli). BERNIE MADOFF The name Bernie Madoff has become synonymous with reprehensible greed after the Wall Street fraudster was caught stealing his victims’ fortunes to live like a king. Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison—the maximum for his crimes—after pleading guilty to 11 counts of myriad financial crimes related to a Ponzi scheme that swallowed up $10 billion of investors’ money. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Madoff).

But the international fraud empire he built over the course of two decades, in which he offered phony high-interest certificates of deposit at a bank he started in Antigua, imploded. He was charged with 13 counts of wire and mail fraud, conspiracy, and money laundering and sentenced to 110 years in prison without parole. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Stanford). STEVE COHEN If he is not number one, Steve Cohen is pretty close to being considered the luckiest man on Wall Street. While federal investigators circled Cohen and his firm, S.A.C. Capital, for nearly a decade, only his employees were convicted of wrongdoing, while Cohen was never nailed. His firm pleaded guilty to insider trading and forker over a record $1.8 billion fine, but all Cohen got was a two-year ban on managing outside money—a most gentle slap on the wrist from the S.E.C. while he happily manages his family office and prepares for his next steps in the hedge fund world. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Cohen). RAJ RAJARATNAM Raj Rajaratnam was a frugal billionaire of sorts—opting to fly commercial and flouting the fancy art and high-end collectables that many of his fellow hedge fund managers favored. But he was also keen on skirting the law, a court found. Rajaratnam was charged with trading on inside information in 2009 and convicted on 14 counts of conspiracy and securities fraud in case considered to be one of the biggest prosecutorial wins in white collar criminal history. He is currently serving out his 11 years in the main prison at the Federal Medical Center at Devens in Ayer, Massachusetts. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Rajaratnam). MICHAEL MILKEN That billionaire Michael Milken, the high-flying junk bond king of Beverly Hills, found himself sobbing in front of a courtroom in 1990 as he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, surely felt like a cruel twist of fate. That he ended up there because another convicted fraudster, Ivan Boesky, traded his name as part of his insider trading charges, surely felt even crueler. Milken was originally charged with 98 counts of racketeering, securities fraud, and mail fraud, though he pleaded guilty to just six counts of conspiracy and fraud related to illegal securities trading. He was ordered to pay $600 million in fines. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Milken). JEFFREY SKILLING Jeffrey Skilling was the chief executive of Enron when the energy-trading giant crumbled under the weight of its accounting schemes, which hid the scope of its financial woes and stripped billions of dollars from shareholders and employees. He was initially sentenced to 24 years in prison—a punishment that was later reduced to 14 years and a $42 fine. He reportedly spent his time behind bars tutoring in Spanish and reading the newspaper to a blind inmate each day. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Skilling). R. FOSTER WINANS A scheme that netted less than $1 million in profits and resulted in an 18-month jail sentence is hardly the sexiest on this list, but the transgression is perhaps the most unusual. Former Wall Street Jornal columnist R. Foster Winans admitted that in the early 1980s, he would slip Peter Brand information about a stock he would be featuring in his column, “Heard on the Street”—the contents of which would often move markets. Brant would make trades based on the early information, and Winans would receive a kickback in kind. Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Getty Images (Winans). MATHEW MARTOMA Over the course of several days in July of 2008, Mathew Martoma sealed his fate. That was when the former S.A.C. Capital portfolio manager allegedly used inside information about a clinical trial for Alzheimer’s drugs to bring in a windfall for his firm. Martoma was one of about 85 individuals who were either convicted of or pleaded guilty in the ensuing investigation that rocked Wall Street, though Martoma’s 9-year sentence was on the harsher side.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Deals | Wed May 31, 2017 | 6:40am EDT China's Zhong An aims to raise at least $1 billion in Hong Kong IPO - sources By Julie Zhu | HONG KONG HONG KONG Zhong An Online Property and Casualty Insurance, China's first online-only insurer, has resumed a plan to raise $1 billion or more in a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) in the second half of this year, said two people with knowledge of the matter. Zhong An, whose major shareholders include Tencent Holdings Ltd (0700.HK) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N) affiliate Ant Financial, plans to apply for listing in the coming weeks, said one of the people, who declined to be identified as the matter is confidential. The Shanghai-based insurer chose Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and UBS in October to lead the IPO, but later suspended the plan to explore a mainland listing. The following February, Reuters reported that the mainland securities regulator was considering streamlining the IPO approval process for large domestic technology firms, such as Zhong An. But lack of progress on the matter prompted Zhong An to opt for Hong Kong, though it would prefer to list in mainland China, one of the people said. "Zhong An has always wanted to list at home but given an A-share IPO is unlikely in the short-term, the company has to come back to Hong Kong to go public and raise fresh capital to expand its business first," said the person, referring to a class of shares on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges. "A domestic listing later is certainly under consideration," the person told Reuters. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has also appeared to slow its IPO process, with seven approvals last week versus a weekly average of 10 in recent months. As of Friday, applications to list in Shanghai or Shenzhen numbered about 600. Zhong An and UBS declined to comment. Credit Suisse and JPMorgan did not respond to requests for comment. HK COUP A Zhong An IPO would be a coup for the Hong Kong stock exchange which has struggled to attract technology listings due to strict profitability and voting rights requirements, bourse Chief Executive Charles Li said this month. Hong Kong famously lost out to New York on Alibaba's 2014 record IPO, sparking a broader debate about the bourse's listing rules. Zhong An was founded in November 2013 by Alibaba Executive Chairman Jack Ma, Tencent Chairman Pony Ma and Ping An Insurance Group Co of China Ltd (601318.SS) (2318.HK) Chairman Ma Mingzhe. It offers more than 300 niche products, many of which are low-cost, including policies covering flight delays, cracked mobile phone screens and shipping costs for returning goods bought online. Ant Financial and Ping An declined to comment. Tencent did not respond to requests for comment.

Big Bank Stocks Could Be Heading Higher. Despite the recent pain, Credit Suisse analysts continue to see double-digit returns universal bank stocks. By Ben Levisohn May 30, 2017 3:37 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Bank stocks like Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Bank of America (BAC) entered 2017 on a rather remarkable run, but since then they have underperformed: The SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) has dropped 4.9% so far this year. Illustration: Getty Images A combination of factors, including a still slow growing U.S. economy, the failure of the Trump administration to pass its growth-boosting measures, and the flattening of the yield curve have caused banks to underperform in 2017. Still, Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke and team remain bullish on so-called "universal banks," particularly Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs. They explain why: ~10-15% upside in recommended names; expect volatility. Given the speed and magnitude of the post-election outperformance, it’s fair to anticipate a good bit of volatility in the stocks—typical at this point in the economic cycle, but also reflective of heightened policy uncertainty (tax reform, regulatory reform, fiscal stimulus plans). We will continue to assess valuations cognizant of the economic cycle, but equally as willing to embrace the changed/changing operating environment. All in, our base case estimates translate to 11% year to year EPS growth and a 13% ROTCE, on average in 2017, with substantial variance around the averages. Our blue sky estimates are ~25% above base case, with near equal incremental upside in the stocks. Looking at a weighted average of our blue sky, base case and gray sky scenarios translates to ~10-15% total return in our recommended names—BAC, JPM, C and GS. We strongly favor the universal banking model, with its multiple levers for growth and greater potential for realization of scale economies. Shares of Bank of America have fallen 1.4% to $22.90 at 3:30 p.m. today, while JPMorgan Chase has dropped 1.6% to $83.96, Citigroup has declined 0.6% to $61.72, and Goldman Sachs has tumbled 2% to $218.3.7 Text Size Regular Medium Large Stocks PREVIOUS No, Electric Cars Won't Kill Oil Stocks...At Least Not All of Them NEXT Signet Jewelers: Pricing in 'Draconian' Downside?

But JPMorgan global equity strategists said they expect UK stocks to claw back some of their underperformance against eurozone and global peers and recommended investors buy into blue-chip, dividend-paying exporters that stand to benefit the most from a weak sterling. "We think UK is becoming interesting in the regional allocation again," JPMorgan's strategists said, adding that signs that investors have turned less risk-averse since early May also bodes well for London-listed stocks. "(The) UK is a defensive market with high dividend yield. It should perform better in the backdrop of potential softening in activity indicators, lower inflation prints and continued range-bound bond yields," JPMorgan said. In Ireland, the ISEQ Overall Index ended the session in positive territory, unlike many of its European peers. It closed up 0.34pc at 6.995.83. Shares in Ryanair surged 3.7pc to €18.42 as the airline reported full-year results and CEO Michael O'Leary said the carrier will extend leases and buy a handful of extra planes from Boeing to meet demand next summer. The carrier also launched a €600m share buyback. Shares in food group Aryzta tumbled nearly 9pc as it reported third quarter results that showed its margins remain under pressure. Bank of Ireland was 2.5pc lower at 24 cent, while betting group Paddy Power Betfair also fell 2.5pc, to €93.02. The UK's FTSE-100 edged 0.28pc lower.

Banks fell hard as executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. An eight-day winning streak for technology companies ended. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drugmakers, high-dividend utilities, and household goods companies.

Exxon Mobil sank 60 cents to $80.50 and Hess declined 78 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $45.89. Michael Kors Holdings hit a five-year low after it said it will close up to 125 stores as its sales have remained weak.

The stock tumbled $3.09, or 8.5 percent, to $33.18. The dollar slipped to 110.57 yen from 110.78 yen. The euro rose to $1.1246 from $1.1188.

But even a reliable paycheck no longer delivers a reliable income.

And a new wave of research shows that the main culprit is not the so-called gig economy, but shifting pay within the same job. This volatility helps unravel a persistent puzzle: why a below-average jobless rate — 4.4 percent in April — is still producing an above-average level of economic anxiety. Turbulence has replaced the traditional American narrative of steady financial progress over a lifetime. Sign up for the Morning Briefing newsletter “Since the 1970s, steady work that pays a predictable and living wage has become increasingly difficult to find,” said Jonathan Morduch, a director of the U.S. Financial Diaries project, an in-depth study of 235 low- and moderate-income households. “This shift has left many more families vulnerable to income volatility.” Ever-changing schedules at Victoria’s Secret, for example, make it difficult for Ms. Casares, 27, to find care for her 2-year-old and 6-year-old and to cover the bills. “The lowest hours I’ve gotten is 15 and the highest I’ve gotten is 39,” said Ms. Casares, who started in October, earning $10 an hour. The schedule is usually posted a month in advance, she said, but there are frequently last-minute changes. Load Error Stability is worth a lot to workers. On average, employees are willing to give up a fifth of their weekly wage to avoid a schedule set by an employer on a week’s notice, according to a field experiment where workers were offered a range of alternative hours at different pay levels. “That is totally the story,” said Mr. Morduch, who watched household incomes in his study rise and fall. “And that instability and insecurity are increasingly a part of middle-class life, too.” In the course of a year, for example, the monthly income of a California family with one child that Mr. Morduch’s team tracked jumped to $5,279 from as low as $1,175. (Strict ethics protocols prohibit the release of participants’ names.) The husband supplemented his steady $400-a-week salaried construction job with extra remodeling work that could add from $323 to $1,588 a month to his total. His wife picked up from zero to $1,824 a month from babysitting, and from selling jewelry, clothing and flowers. Monthly expenses can pendulum as much as income, but the two do not necessarily move in tandem. An analysis of 250,000 bank accounts by the JPMorgan Chase Institute, a nonprofit research arm of the bank, found that roughly 80 percent of households had an insufficient cash buffer to manage the mismatch between income and expenses in a given month. Few people can comfortably ride out the inevitable financial bronco ride. “Only households that earn $105,000 or more a year are secure against the volatility they are exposed to,” said Diana Farrell, the institute’s president and chief executive. “It’s not just about the unemployed or the poor.” Middle-income households, for example, saw their monthly expenses deviate by nearly $1,300, the equivalent of a month’s rent or mortgage payment. And one uh-oh expense — usually in the form of a medical, tax or car repair bill — can wreck a family’s balance sheet for a year or more. Even a single month’s volatility can have a cascading effect. One month, a family copes by using the money earmarked for, say, the utility bill to cover the cost of replacing a busted water heater. The next month, it’s the telephone company that goes unpaid as the family struggles to make up the missed utility bill plus late fees and interest — and so on. Emergencies are not the only source of expense spikes. So are bridal showers, Christmas gifts and outgrown winter coats.© Mark Lyons for The New York Times Tomika Waggoner, a nursing home aide, in Newport, Ky. Her work schedule depends on her ability to find care for her son. May turned out to be an expensive month for Tomika Waggoner, 44, a nursing home aide in Newport, Ky. Her daughter was graduating from high school, and she needed a few hundred dollars to pay for her cap and gown, commencement fees, a prom ticket and a dress. Ms. Waggoner’s work schedule depends on her ability to find care for her 15-year-old son, who has epilepsy. So sometimes she works a weekend at $17 an hour and sometimes three $15-an-hour weekdays. For the Waggoner family, and many others with low and moderate incomes, a tax refund offered a once-a-year lifeline. That $700 check and a contribution from her mother covered most of the graduation costs and helped pay off the debt on some furniture. (Doctor’s visits and medical payments are frequently scheduled to coincide with tax refunds, according to the JPMorgan Chase Institute.) “I also went to a couple of food pantries,” Ms. Waggoner added. “We ate a lot of bologna.” Rather than causing jolts in income, the gig economy is, for many people, what smooths them out. Only about 0.5 percent of the labor force is working in the gig economy. And while bonuses, extra commissions and overtime bump up a worker’s average income, unwelcome reductions in hours, particularly at the lower end of the income ladder, more often shrink an expected paycheck. “Stable, predictable work schedules are essential to economic security,” said Susan J. Lambert, a professor at the University of Chicago who is studying new data supplied by the General Social Survey, a respected national survey that began asking in-depth questions about work schedules only last year. The latest data shows that 41 percent of all hourly workers say they are not given more than a week’s notice of their schedule; nearly half have little or no say on their work hours. “It’s not just service, or female-dominated jobs, but some of the most challenging schedules are production and construction jobs,” Ms. Lambert said. The ubiquity of the phenomenon has frequently been masked by annual measures of income and spending or one-time snapshots of savings and debt that fail to capture fluctuations week to week or month to month. Ms. Casares said that when she had to turn down an inconvenient shift at Victoria’s Secret, like staying until midnight to close, her schedule the following week would suffer. “I would be facing fewer hours,” she said. To supplement the light weeks, Ms. Casares started picking up a shift as a part-time server at Olive Garden ($5.39 an hour plus tips). The number of Americans living comfortably or doing all right financially has grown since the recession. Still, the new Fed report found that 30 percent — roughly 73 million adults — say they are finding it difficult to get by financially, or are just getting by. To Mr. Morduch and his co-author, Rachel Schneider, the rise in income volatility is an indication of how businesses in an era of advancing technology and global competition have shifted risk onto employees. Consider the cost of saving for retirement and medical care. When health insurance premiums for employers soared between 2003 and 2013 (before the Affordable Care Act went into effect), workers picked up 93 percent of the extra cost. Asked whether her job at Victoria’s Secret provided benefits, Ms. Casares said it did: “We’re given three bras and a bottle of Bombshell, their No. 1 selling perfume.” Health or retirement contributions are not part of the package.

Just after noon, a man in a cowboy hat and sunglasses entered a J.P. Morgan Chase Bank at 1405 South Voss, where he approached a teller and whipped out a pistol before displaying a device with lights and wires that he claimed was a bomb.  The would-be robber threatened to detonate the device if tellers did not immediately hand over cash.  The FBI and Crime Stoppers are searching for a suspect who robbed the Prosperity Bank at 9155 W. Sam Houston Parkway on Tuesday, May 16, 2017. Media: Houston Chronicle But as it happened, the teller draws were empty so the aspiring bandit left without any loot, the FBI said in a press release.  Investigators believe the so-called bomb was a hoax, and no one was hurt in the heist.  The robber was last scene fleeing the scene in a gray 2007 Ford Mustang with a paper plate on the back and a hard plate on the front. He's described as a 6-foot white man in his mid-50s with a thin build. He may have a tattoo on his right forearm.  Crime Stoppers is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in the case. To report tips, call 713-222-TIPS (8477) or the FBI Houston Field Office at (713) 693-5000. Latest from the Chron.com Homepage Click below for the top news from around the Houston area and beyond.

Thanks for reading and your comments.        Have a great and relaxing weekend and see you all again Monday morning from 9. 4:25pm on 2 Jun 2017 Shares bounced solidly higher on Friday, with strong performances across most sectors helping the index recoup losses made earlier in the week. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 opened very strongly on Friday, after a strong Wall Street session and rising iron ore futures. It closed up 0.9 per cent at 5788.1, a narrow 0.6 per cent gain for the week. It's the second weekly gain for the index, which might suggest it's leaving the doldrums of May behind. But AMP Capital's head of investment strategy Shane Oliver warned shares remained "vulnerable ot a short-term setback". "We are now in a weaker seasonal period for shares with risks around Trump, North Korea, Chinese growth and the Fed's next rate hike providing potential triggers," he said. "However, with valuations remaining okay – particularly outside of the US, global monetary conditions remaining easy and profits improving on the back of stronger global growth, we continue to see any pullback in shares as an opportunity to 'buy the dips'. Shares are likely to trend higher on a 6-12 month horizon." Energy stocks were hard hit over the week, comprising many of the ASX200's biggest losers over the five sessions. Most other sectors traded into the black, with the heavyweight big four banks finishing up, recovering some of their outsized losses in May. Commonwealth Bank and Westpac both gained 0.3 per cent over the week, ANZ was up 0.2 while NAB jumped 0.8 per cent over the five sessions. Shares in Macquarie added 1.3 per cent over the week, as sources from the millionaire factory hinted the company could be moving off-shore to avoid the bank levy imposed in the budget. Iron ore futures halted a six-day fall, climbing 2 per cent on Friday to provide some support to the big miners. BHP gained 1.4 per cent on Friday and 0.3 per cent over the five sessions. Rio Tinto also had a good Friday but couldn't reverse the week's falls, closing down 1.3 per cent from Monday's open. The materials sector as a whole rose 0.4 per cent over the week. The week's best performance among the top 200 stocks was Janus Henderson Group, a newly-completed merger between Henderson Global Investors and Janus Capital, which surged 5.4 per cent on Friday and 11.5 per cent over the week. Meanwhile logistics giant Qube left a trading halt on Friday after completing a $350 million capital raising to fund a new Sydney freight exchange. It was up 0.8 per cent on Friday. Winners and losers in the ASX 200 this week. Photo: Bloomberg 3:57pm on 2 Jun 2017 Don't panic about housing - at least not yet, Capital Economics recommends. "While the latest figures support the view we laid out in March that the housing market is past its peak and that it will slow during this year and next, they aren't as bad as some of the headlines suggest," economist Paul Dales says. House prices fell 1.1 per cent in May, led by falls of 1.3 per cent in Sydney and 1.7 per cent in Melbourne. These prices are influenced by the normal peaks and troughs in activity during the calendar year, Dales says, adding that historically prices tend to drop in May. But while a housing market crash has not begun, a slowdown is almost certainly underway, he says, pointing to a drop in auction clearance rates from 85 per cent in January to 75 per cent in May, or slower growth in new home sales. And that's before either of these indicators had time to respond to the latest rises in mortgage rates or APRA's new lending rules. "It probably won't be long before a further softening in demand drags house price inflation even further below 5 per cent," Dales says. Looking further ahead, Capital Economics predicts that prices probably won't increase much next year and could start to fall in 2019 and 2020 as the RBA raises interest rates from their current record low. Sydney prices could receive a boost from this week's stamp duty concessions, but Dales reckons it's unlikely to outweigh rising mortgage rates and tightening credit conditions.   3:38pm on 2 Jun 2017 Chinese iron ore futures climbed more than 2 per cent on Friday, snapping a six-day fall and buoying local miners, although the outlook for the steelmaking raw material remained bleak amid ample supply. Weaker steel prices also capped gains in iron ore, with Shanghai rebar futures down for a seventh session in a row. The most-traded iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange was up 2.1 per cent at 431 yuan ($85) a tonne. The contract touched a six-month low of 415 yuan on Thursday and has lost about 5 per cent for the week so far. "Restocking demand was also subdued with reports that several Chinese steel mills were reselling iron ore cargoes procured via long-term contracts," Commonwealth Bank of Australia analyst Vivek Dhar said in a note. "Elevated Chinese port stocks also weighed on prices." Imported iron ore at China's ports reached 136.6 million tonnes on May 26, the highest since SteelHome consultancy began tracking the data in 2004. That is enough to build the Eiffel Tower in Paris more than 13,000 times over. Spot iron ore fell 1.8 per cent to $US55.97 a tonne overnight, the lowest since October. The spot benchmark has declined 41 per cent from this year's peak. Also on Friday, the most-active rebar on the Shanghai Futures Exchange dropped 1.4 per cent to 3,052 yuan a tonne, marking the seventh straight day of declines. Steel had been holding up much better than iron ore over the past months, but that seems to have changed. "In the long run, China's steel demand will trend down despite short-term volatility," Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report, citing a view by the China Iron and Steel Association. There's enough iron ore at China's ports to build 13,000 Eiffel Towers. Photo: extravagantni 3:24pm on 2 Jun 2017 Former Primary Health Care chief executive Peter Gregg has strongly denied he is working with major shareholder and possible suitor Chinese firm Jangho Group. Despite a 6 per cent jump in Primary share price on Thursday and rumours swirling of a possible takeover, Gregg rebuffed the idea he has teamed up with the CHY12.3 billion ($2.43 billion) Shanghai-listed Jangho, which is looking to build its presence in Australian healthcare assets.  "I categorically deny I'm working with Jangho," Gregg told The Australian Financial Review.  "I'm not working in any capacity with them. I'm restricted from this. This is not true at all .... your sources are wrong." Gregg exited Primary on May 22 after talking with chairman Rob Ferguson. The AFR revealed on May 1 that Primary had hired Malcolm Parmenter from Sonic as its new head.    Gregg had formally stepped down from his role as CEO in January when it was revealed that the Australian Securities and Investment Commission charged him with two counts of falsifying documents in 2011 while he was CFO at what was then Leighton Holdings (now CIMIC). He has denied the charges.  Shares are up 0.2 per cent at $3.92. Back to top 2:52pm on 2 Jun 2017 Telstra hasn't exactly been a portfolio rocket this year, with shares down nearly 12 per cent due to concerns that increased competition will hit earnings and eventually the dividend. But the worst seems to be over for the stock, which has gained about 13 per cent since its mid-April low of $4.00 to trade at $4.51 today. In another welcome boost for investors, Goldman Sachs has upgraded Telstra to 'buy', with a price target of $5.00, saying the stock offers good value. Goldies reckons the telco has the best network, will deliver higher cost cuts than flagged and, not least, has the means for a decent sized share buyback as well as dishing out a higher dividend. "We believe the combination of Telstra's dominant networks (the fastest in Australia), its vast scale, and a clear, domestic focused strategy has put the company in a strong position to successfully navigate an increasingly competitive market," the analysts write. They also say the telco's $1 billion productivity program looks conservative relative to global peers. "At current pricing, Telstra's valuation is attractive, with a dividend yield that is amongst the highest in the market – while the capital allocation review provides further optionality to crystalize significant value," the analysts say. They estimate that if Telstra were to securitise its NBN payment stream at a discount rate of 4.55 per cent and buy back stock, it would add about 20 per cent to earnings-per-share across financial years 2019-21, supporting a dividend of 34 cents (currently: 31 cents).  "We believe this could be announced at Telstra's full-year result on August 17, along with an update on the performance of its productivity program – something which we view as critical for the company's long-term earnings profile," the analysts write in a note to clients. Goldman sees long-term earnings flow as well as increased competition - particularly if TPG's performance is better than expected - as the main risks for the telco. 2:39pm on 2 Jun 2017 Logistics giant Qube has completed the institutional phase of a $350 million capital raising that will fund development of its new Sydney freight interchange. Qube said it has raised $118 million at $2.35 a share in an institutional entitlement offer that was 99 per cent taken up, and $122 million in a placement to institutions that was oversubscribed at $2.42 a share. That compares to a share price of $2.622 when the stock was placed in a trading halt earlier this week. Qube will use $80 million to pay for warehouse construction at the Moorebank Logistics Park in southwest Sydney, and will allocate the balance to other investments and future growth. The company will open a $110 million retail entitlement offer next Wednesday. Shares in Qube came out of a two-day trading halt this morning and are currently up 1.3 per cent at $2.675. 2:03pm on 2 Jun 2017 The Australian dollar remains on track for another weekly loss amid broad strength in the greenback and on lingering concerns from an unexpected slump in China's manufacturing activity. The Aussie is hovering just above a three-week low of US73.72¢, and is poised to end the week around 0.9 per cent lower, its sixth week in the red out of the past seven. The currency is struggling to recover ground after the private Caixin purchasing managers' survey yesterday showed that China's manufacturing activity had contracted for the first time in nearly a year. "It was a week that brought out the bears, the markets (over-)reacting to every weak print (Caixin PMI) but glossed over any good news such as the Chinese official PMIs remaining solid and a surprise +1 per cent bump in retail sales in April," said TD Securities Asia-Pacific chief macro strategist Annette Beacher.  Adding to pressure on the Aussie, the US dollar rallied overnight on upbeat US private sector job figures as investors await the closely-watched non-farm payrolls report for another potential boost. "Throw in another near-2 per cent fall in iron ore prices and growing expectations that ... Australian growth could come in negative, and the makings of a depreciating AUD are there," said Jason Wong, currency strategist at BNZ Bank, referring to Australia's first quarter gross domestic product data due out on Wednesday. A week that brought out the Aussie bears. Photo: Bloomberg 1:34pm on 2 Jun 2017 Japan's Nikkei share average has shot through the 20,000-point barrier for the first time since December 2015 after a batch of strong US economic data lifted Wall Street and the US currency against the yen. The Nikkei swept through 20,000 in early trade making a 1.3 per cent advance to 20,115.23, its highest level since August 2015. The index was poised to post weekly gains of 2.1 per cent. The threshold of "20,000 is a big technical and psychological level for traders, so we should be not be surprised if we see some resistance at this level," said Gavin Parry, managing director at Parry International Trading. Traders added that when there is a recovery seen in the global environment, there is a greater focus on Japan Inc earnings which saw profit growth of 16 per cent in the fiscal year through March. "Japanese stocks would have risen to this level earlier if we did not see global risks and the rising yen," said Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. But US political turmoil could unnerve investors next week again, Fujito said, as former FBI director James Comey will testify next Thursday before a US Senate panel investigating Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 US election, in a hearing that could add to difficulties facing President Donald Trump. "The market is worried that the allegations against Trump over his interference with a federal investigation would delay his efforts on tax cuts and economic policy," Fujito said, adding that there is also a risk that the US dollar will fall against the yen, hurting Japanese stocks. Cyclical sectors were pushed up by recovering risk appetites, with financials and exporters outperforming. Nomura has jumped 4.7 per cent, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group has soared 3.1 per cent, while insurer T&D Holdings surged 3.6 per cent. Subaru Corp added 3.3 per cent and Kyocera Corp advanced 2.7 per cent. The Nikkei has topped 20,000 for the first time in 18 months. Photo: Eugene Hoshiko 1:23pm on 2 Jun 2017 And while we menton rates: Three of the country's big banks have cut interest rates paid to many customers with savings accounts in the past month as lenders try to protect their profit margins. In a move likely to save banks money but attract little public attention, both Westpac and ANZ lowered the "base" rates they on pay online savings accounts during May, while increasing short-term "introductory" rates by the same amount. The changes mean the advertised rates for these products are unchanged, even though long-term customers will receive lower rates of interest on their money. Meanwhile, Commonwealth Bank also cut the rates it pays on its bonus savings accounts by 0.1 percentage points for balances of up to $50,000 during May, while lifting rates on higher balances.  The cuts come as new figures from financial comparison site Mozo show all of the big four banks have cut interest for online savings accounts by more than the 0.5 percentage point reduction in official interest rates over the past year. Mozo figures show Westpac and the Commonwealth Bank have lowered base rates on online savings accounts by 0.75 percentage points in the last year, ANZ has cut its base rate by 0.8 percentage points, and NAB lowered its base rate by 0.6 percentage points. The big four banks have over the past year cut rates on savings accounts more than the RBA's easing over that period. Photo: Paul Rovere Back to top 12:57pm on 2 Jun 2017 Here's the latest by the AFR's Chris Joye on 'how to invest like the professionals': Most investors hold bank shares and deposits, which book-end a rich capital structure. Yet few have exposure to the assets that reside in between — including senior bonds, subordinated bonds, hybrids and securities like AAA rated "covered bonds", which rank ahead of, and are actually safer than, wholesale deposits. Years ago my team developed a plan to launch a passive exchange traded fund (ETF) that would invest in senior-ranking, floating-rate notes issued by Australia's top banks. The idea was to furnish punters with a liquid and divisible medium through which to access the superior interest rates on offer in the $1.6 trillion unlisted bond market, which trades in minimum $500,000 parcels. We shelved the plan because the economics did not stack up for an active manager. The good news is that ETF provider BetaShares is this week launching a strikingly similar product called the Australian Bank Senior Floating-Rate Bond ETF (ASX code: QPON) that could presage a revolution in fixed-income investing. BetaShares already has a cash deposit ETF (ASX: AAA) that has grown to more than $1.1 billion in size given its attractive at-call interest rate (currently 2.02 per cent). The new bank floating-rate note ETF will pay materially higher gross interest of 2.87 per cent, or 2.65 per cent after the 22-basis-point management fee, which comfortably beats the best at-call and term deposit rates. (Net interest will be lower — perhaps around 2.5 per cent — after round-trip retail brokerage, which most institutions should be able to minimise.) Eighty per cent of the ETF will be allocated to senior floating rate notes issued by the four majors, with the remaining 20 per cent invested with smaller banks, which approximates the distribution of market capitalisation weights. The bonds will have a typical maturity of four years with a strong weighted-average A+ credit rating. Here's more at the AFR Australian super funds have the second lowest allocation to cash and bonds in the developed world behind only Poland.  Photo: 12:34pm on 2 Jun 2017 Downer EDI has again extended its offer for takeover target Spotless Group, with the hostile bid now stretched to June 29. Downer announced the extension today, also saying it will accelerate payments to accepting Spotless shareholders if its stake in the target passes 50 per cent by June 16. Chief executive of Downer, Gran Fenn, said the company was maintaining its offer at $1.15 a share and described the price as "full and fair" and representing a 59 per cent premium to Spotless's share price when the bid was launched in March. "The alternative for Spotless shareholders is to put their faith in a company which saw a share price decline of almost 70 per cent in the two years prior to the announcement date and which has acknowledged the risks around the execution of its strategy reset," Fenn said. Spotless's board has urged shareholders to reject Downer, saying they can do better in future by retaining their ownership as the company goes through a strategy reset to boost earnings growth. Downer has declared its $1.15 bid - which values Spotless at $1.3 billion - as final in the absence of a higher competing bid.It will now waive outstanding defeating conditions if it reaches 50 per cent acceptances by June 16, with accelerated payments to start on June 19. Spotless shares are up 2.2 per cent at $1.145 while Downer have added 0.6 per cent to $6.435. Downer has once again extended its bid for Spotless. Photo: Angela Brkic 11:51am on 2 Jun 2017 Sales of new homes rose slightly in April, new figures show, but the housing industry remains concerned the improvement will not halt a continuing weakening in construction and buying activity. The New Home Sales report from the Housing Industry Association shows new home sales rose 0.8 per cent nationally in April, with New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia all recording increases in sales of detached housing. HIA senior economist Geordan Murray warned the April rise would not negate a continuing downward trend, pointing to policy changes including the NSW government's move this week to increase taxes for foreign property investors, as creating uncertainty and threatening activity. 11:39am on 2 Jun 2017 Bankwest will today announce a 76 basis point interest rate rise for principal and interest home buyers, the latest twist in lenders' attempts to slow borrowing and lower risk of bad debt on loan books as market sentiment sours. The CBA subsidiary is creating a new category of low deposit lenders for those with less than 5 per cent deposit by raising rates to 5.29 per cent, up from 4.53 per cent. The new rate is inclusive of expensive lenders' mortgage insurance. The comparative rate, which takes into account all fees and charges, will rise from 4.94 per cent to 5.69 per cent. For a $1 million home buyer with a 30-year, principal and interest $950,000 loan, the new rate of 5.29 per cent will mean an increase in monthly payments of $439 to $5269, according to analysis by finder.com, which monitors fees and charges of financial service products. The higher rates apply to higher loan-to-value owner-occupied, principal and interest borrowers, which until now have largely avoided big increases as lenders focused on interest-only. Many lenders, including Westpac and ANZ, are lowering rates for owner occupier principal and interest borrowers, who pay down the loan principal in addition to interest. They are also providing incentives for switches from interest-only, such as waiving new loan fees. Bankwest has hiked mortgage rates. Photo: Glenn Hunt 11:17am on 2 Jun 2017 First-home buyers in NSW will applaud Premier Gladys Berejiklian's decision to axe stamp duty for all properties cheaper than $650,000 - but the relief is unlikely to last as the step could well provide the next boost to already sky-high house prices. First-home buyers have been struggling to get a foot into a market dominated by cashed-up investors, and one of their biggest gripes has been having to pay stamp duty. In a recent report by CoreLogic, across NSW the largest proportion of respondents (48%) identified that stamp duty was the most significant obstacle to housing affordability. And almost three-quarters of respondents felt that removing or reducing stamp duty would be an effective way to improve housing affordability in NSW. But CoreLogic head of research Tim Lawless warns that abolishing stamp duty may just cause different headaches for first home buyers. "We can expect first home buyer activity to stall before surging higher on July 1. The long-term outcome may be self-defeating due to higher demand pushing up prices," he said.  The current policy provides a stamp duty exemption to first home buyers purchasing a new home with a price tag under $550,000.  The new policy has substantially broader scope, providing an exemption for both new and established housing with a price tag under $650,000 and sliding discounts up to $800,000. CoreLogic notes that over the past 12 months, 45.4 per cent of dwellings sold across NSW had a price tag of $650,000. In the Sydney metropolitan area the proportion of properties that meet the exemption criteria falls away sharply, as just 25.8 per cent of dwelling sales over the past twelve months were at a price of $650,000 or less. Breaking that down further, just 20 per cent of detached houses in Sydney sold for $650,000 or less while unit sales comprised just over one third of all sales at or below this price. But Lawless says that a rise in first time buyer demand could prop up the overall housing market, filling the "hole" left by fewer investors in the market and offseting the recent slowdown in the pace of capital gains. Back to top 11:01am on 2 Jun 2017 Donald Trump has spoken: the US will exit the landmark 2015 Paris climate accord. And clean-energy investors shrugged it off, for now. Solar stocks barely budged after the announcement overnight. The Bloomberg Intelligence Global Large Solar Energy Valuation index of 16 companies gained 0.8 per cent at the close in New York. JinkoSolar, the world's biggest panel producer, climbed 2.7 per cent, and that was one of the bigger swings. Canadian Solar, the top North American supplier, gained 0.8 per cent, and US rival SunPower Corp rose 1.5 per cent. Seoul-based Hanwha Q Cells posted one of the larger losses, and that was just 2.1 per cent. Today's decision is a setback for the environment and for the U.S.'s leadership position in the world. #ParisAgreement— Lloyd Blankfein (@lloydblankfein) June 1, 2017 The muted response is a sign that investors expect demand for clean energy will continue go grow, in the US and around the world. "Trying to make a short trade on a long-term trend is risky," SunPower chief executive Tom Werner said in an interview. The reaction followed a more volatile Wednesday, suggesting that investors have already moved beyond their gut reactions, said Joseph Osha, an analyst at JMP Securities. Most solar shares declined, with Canadian Solar and JinkoSolar both down more than 5 per cent, on the first reports that Trump intended to withdraw the US from the Paris agreement. "It's sentiment," said Angelo Zino, analyst at CFRA Research. "Will Trump exiting the Paris-climate accord have an impact on solar demand in the next nine to 12 months? Probably not." Michael Liebreich, the London-based founder of Bloomberg New Energy Finance, put it another way: the Paris accord is "nothing more than an international framework for discussion and expectation-setting. There's nothing binding about Paris other than discussions." In the US, federal tax credits and state-level renewables mandates have been key drivers of wind and solar growth. It's not clear how Trump's plan will affect these policies, if at all. "The US is so hedged around the initiatives at the state level," Liebreich said. "As long as those are not dismantled on an accelerated time frame, nothing appreciably will change." Investors expect demand for clean energy will continue go grow, even in the US. Photo: AP 10:48am on 2 Jun 2017 Janus Henderson's Australian shares are the top gainer in the ASX200 this morning, rising more than 6 per cent to $45.44. It comes as Credit Suisse started coverage with a "neutral" rating of the asset manager and a price target of $33, saying there is a cross-sell opportunity for Henderson in the US and Japan. Additionally, Fitch assigned the company a 'BBB' credit rating with a positive outlook. Three of nine brokerages rate the stock a "buy" and six a "hold", with an average price target of $42.30. British-Australian asset manager Henderson Global Investors last year agreed to buy US fund firm Janus Capital and dual list the $US6 billion giant in New York and Sydney, cancelling the London listing. Earlier this week the two announced the completion of the all-stock merger. 10:31am on 2 Jun 2017 Shares have bounced higher at the open, with gains across most sectors bar utilities, as Wall Street's recod-busting mood catches on. The ASX is up 0.6 per cent at 5774.7, putting the benchmark index on track for a modest weekly gain of around 0.5 per cent. This week's data flow has so far painted a picture of robust US economic growth but possible moderation in China, CMC chief market analyst Ric Spooner notes. "This has combined to put pressure on the Aussie dollar. However a solid overnight performance by US markets should deliver a firm start for trading in the ASX 200 this morning." The S&P 500 rose 0.8 per cent and closed on its high with buyers in charge and led up by the financial sector. That's helped the local banks, which are all up around 0.5 per cent. Telstra is another strong performer, rising 1 per cent after the stock was upgraded to a 'buy' by Goldman Sachs. Macquarie Atlas continues to outperform, rising 3 per cent to take its gains since mid-March to more than 30 per cent. Like other bond proxies, the stock has been profiting from the falls in global yields. Among the losers are yesterday's biggest winners: utilities, led by a 1.9 per cent drop in AGL. 9:59am on 2 Jun 2017 SPONSORED POST The leads from Wall Street suggest we close out the week on a more positive note, with the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 pushing to new all-time highs and the Dow looking like it just needs a good payrolls report tonight to join this camp, IG strategist Chris Weston says: The focus of the night has really been three-fold. Firstly, much discussion has centred on Trump's confirmation he will take the US out of the Paris Climate Accord and looking to "renegotiate" a new deal more in the interests of the US. Of course, House Speaker Paul Ryan was quick to jump on this and applaud the great man, as it is of course a raw deal for the US. Every other global leader will condemn this action and the likes of Al Gore has said the American people will continue to work with the ideology that climate change is real and will set an example. As a market reaction, it's been a whippy night in the oil markets, and while we saw a sizeable 6.42 million barrel drawdown in official crude inventory data and a sizeable 2.8 million draw in gasoline, the move away from the Paris Accord has caused a few oil traders to sell given Trump's actions could in theory, lead to increased oil production. Traders have also been keen to play the oil move in FX markets, with USD/CAD breaking the May downtrend and I'd be happy to hold longs here into $C1.3600 in the very short-term. We have also seen some focus on the confirmation that former FBI Director James Comey will testify on 8 June before the Senate Intelligence Panel. It actually promises to be a fairly hectic day, with the market keen to hear any key revelations from Comey, while we also get the ECB meeting and UK election exit polls in the early hours of the Fridays Asia trade. Thirdly, US data has given the equity bulls some inspiration, although they seem to have gone it alone and there was hardly any move in corporate credit markets or US Treasuries on the day. In fact the US yield curve is currently sitting at 91 basis points and hardly thematic of a market wanting to load up on US banks, which is what we saw, with the S&P 500 financial sector closing up over 1%. The ADP private payrolls reported 253,000 jobs created in May, well above consensus and it gives us hope at least that tonight's non-farm payrolls will be close enough to the consensus print of 182,000 (economists estimate range from 245,000 to 130,000). Of course keep an eye on average hourly earnings too, with consensus calling for a 2.6% increase in wages. Here's more Markets so far have shrugged off Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris Accord. Photo: AP 9:51am on 2 Jun 2017 Former RBA governor Glenn Stevens has endorsed a crackdown on tax concessions for negative gearing in his first major public report since leaving his old job.  Stevens in a report on the NSW government's housing affordability package blamed negative gearing for the lack of investment by corporates in rental housing. He said Australia's rental stock was in the hands of individuals rather than corporate investors at least in part because of negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions. "Individuals are prepared to accept very low rental yields because of the tax concessions. Institutional investors are unlikely to find those yields attractive. It would be a bad mistake to offer them a separate round of tax concessions or subsidies in order to secure their involvement. It would be better to lessen the generosity of the concessions to individuals." He said the Commonwealth tax experts should investigate the matter. The remarks will provide support to the federal opposition's call for an end to negative gearing and they are consistent with concerns expressed during Stevens' time at the RBA that the tax system was encouraging speculative investment in property. Stevens also expressed concerns about state government subsidies to investors. He called for research on how many home owners grants go to those buying investment properties and questioned why NSW wanted to subsidise that investment strategy. Ex-RBA chief Glenn Stevens has taken a shot at negative gearing. Photo: Dominic Lorrimer Back to top Search pagination Current page Live Article Posts1 Next Live Article Posts2 Share via Email Post on facebook wall Share on Google Plus Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit 1 new post(s) available.

KEEPING SCORE: France’s CAC-40 gained 0.5 percent to 5,308.60 and Germany’s DAX advanced 0.4 percent to 12,660.42. London’s FTSE 100 retreated 0.3 percent to 7,543.86. On Wednesday, the DAX gained 0.1 percent while the FTSE 100 shed 0.1 percent and the CAC-40 lost 0.4 percent. On Wall Street, futures for the Dow Jones industrial average and Standard & Poor’s 500 index were up just under 0.1 percent. ASIA’S DAY: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.5 percent to 3,102.62 while Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 advanced 1.1 percent to 19,860.03. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.5 percent to 25,779.34 and Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 added 0.2 percent to 5,738.10. South Korea’s Kospi shed 0.1 percent to 2,344.61 and India’s Sensex was unchanged at 31,155.89. Benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Singapore rose while Bangkok retreated. WALL STREET: U.S. stocks fell on a sharp drop for banks and a rare loss for tech companies. That offset gains for drug makers and consumer-focused companies. Banks fell after executives from JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America said their trading businesses are having a rough second quarter. Energy companies fell with oil prices. Investors picked consumer-focused companies, drug makers and high-dividend utilities and household goods companies. The S&P 500 lost less than 0.1 percent to 2,411.80. The Dow dropped 0.1 percent to 21,008.65. CHINESE MANUFACTURING: The Chinese business magazine Caixin said its purchasing managers’ index declined for a third month, falling to 49.6 from April’s 50.3 on a 100-point scale on which numbers below 50 show activity contracting. That came after a separate PMI on Wednesday by the National Bureau of Statistics and an industry group, the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, improved to 54.5 from 54. ANALYST’S TAKE: “Today’s PMI reading points to growth having slowed more rapidly last month than the official PMI initially suggested,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. Reasons for the conflicting readings were unclear, but one possibility is that Caixin’s survey includes more small or private companies than the official measure. “The latest data are still consistent with our broader outlook on the Chinese economy,” said Evans-Pritchard. “We have long been warning that the rebound in growth during the second half of last year would prove short-lived.” TRUMP AND CLIMATE: President Donald Trump was preparing to announce whether he will pull the United States out of the 195-nation Paris agreement to combat global warming by reducing carbon emissions. U.S. allies around the world sounded alarms about the likely consequences of an American withdrawal. On Twitter, Trump said he still was listening to “a lot of people both ways.” Abandoning the pact would isolate the U.S. from allies who spent years negotiating the 2015 agreement. KOREA TRADE: May exports rose 13.4 percent over a year earlier but growth decelerated from April. Exports are forecast to maintain relatively robust growth this year, possibly helped by the release of a new Samsung smartphone model. But they also face potential risks from rising pressure in the United States and Europe for restrictions on imports, as well as possible slowing Chinese growth. INDIAN MANUFACTURING: A survey showed Indian manufacturing activity grew in May but more slowly than April. A purchasing managers’ index declined to 51.6 from April’s six-month high of 52.5 on a 100-point scale on which numbers above 50 show activity expanding.

No? Neither does Wall Street. The Dow popped 136 points to 21,144 on Thursday, landing at its first record close since March 1. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq also finished at all-time highs. While many American were focused on the fallout from President Trump's decision to withdraw from the climate deal, market analysts said Thursday's march higher on Wall Street was linked to healthy signals from the U.S. economy. "It's not because of the climate accord. People expected that," said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. Investors were instead fired up by a report from ADP showing the U.S. added 253,000 private-sector jobs in May. Wall Street is betting that's a very good sign ahead of Friday's more closely-watched government jobs report. "It was a very strong reading and helps reduce worries the economy had lost momentum," Kelly said. The Dow is now up more than 500 points since the Trump-fueled selloff on May 17. Solid jobs numbers on Friday should clear the way for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates later this month. They would also reassure investors that the rebound in corporate profit growth can continue. In many ways, the Dow is just playing catch-up with the other indexes that were already in record territory. While the Nasdaq is up 16% this year and the S&P 500 has rallied 8.5%, the Dow is up a more modest 7%. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities, said Wall Street's better mood is partly because Trump's scandals are getting less attention.

It did it this time without the stocks that fuelled the strongest stretches of the Trump trade. The 120-year-old Dow became the last major US equity gauge to snap out of a malaise that was underscored by a 373-point rout on May 17, when questions arose about the president's dealings with his FBI director.

While it's axiomatic on Wall Street that rallies never get anywhere without banks, some see reason for optimism when the advance is carried by companies that may not need President Donald Trump's policy agenda to succeed. "It's a good sign," Marshall Front, who manages $US800 million at Front Barnett Associates in Chicago, said by phone. "People got crazy and went overboard on the Trump agenda. This is a shift away from that reflation play." The Dow's reliance on consumer shares this year epitomises the dramatic shift in investor psychology over the last six months. Banks and oil companies took the spotlight in the wake of the November election as investors prepared for higher inflation and regulatory rollbacks from the Trump administration. Such hopes are on life support as gridlock and disarray grip Washington and rebounding earnings lift tech stocks. Rising corporate profits are consistent across the biggest winners in the Dow. McDonald's just posted its eighth straight quarter of better-than-expected earnings, and Apple beat forecasts for the fourth time on its last report. Caterpillar stock surged 7.9 per cent when it reported earnings on April 25. Due to its slower climb, the Dow has fewer stocks trading at elevated levels than its peers, data compiled by Bloomberg show. About 57 per cent of its members are trading above their 50-day average, compared with 87 per cent at the last record. In the S&P 500, about 65 per cent are trading higher.

Corbat spoke at an investor conference after executives from JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) said at conferences on Wednesday that trading revenue was down from a year ago on lower volatity and weaker client activity. Corbat said the bank will give more details in a presentation later this month. JPMorgan described a decline so far of about 15 percent. Bank of America described a 10-to-12 percent decline. Year-earlier results were boosted by trading ahead of the United Kingdom's vote on Brexit.

"I used to study the 'fives' to see why they liked us and the 'ones' to see why they hated us," Moore said. "But you have to pay as much attention to the twos, threes and fours. Look at everyone and study why they didn't give us a higher score.” In her two and a half years as head of digital, the bank’s active mobile users increased by about 50%. "We have 22 million users. It is not just an expense play, it is an experience play, it is a revenue play, it is a building-connections play," she said. "All roads lead back to mobile.” Be sure to check out this separate interview on the nonwork stuff, like family and personal goals. Solid, not stellar: JPMorgan Chase is concentrating on growth in its credit card and mortgage businesses this year as it awaits more interest rate hikes to help boost profit margins, said Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake. She expects a “solid, not stellar” second quarter and is hopeful for relief on capital requirements and stress testing. “Consumers are in very good shape, their balance sheets are repaired, they’re pretty liquid,” she said. So far regulatory relief has yet to emerge, though “key open roles” in the Trump administration, once filled, could result in some progress on that front, Lake said, without specifying which roles. “Nothing has actually changed,” she said. “And so when we come into work every day right now, we still need to work very hard to comply with the rules as they currently stand.” Not for sale: Aggressive restructuring moves and stock buybacks are buying CIT time, but it will need to show growth in its core banking business to stave off calls for the company to sell itself. The turnaround plan laid out by Chief Executive Officer Ellen Alemany calls for CIT to hit a target of 10% return on equity by 2018. Falling short surely would make investors restless, but a CIT spokeswoman said it’s making “tremendous progress” toward its goal. The ROE was at 7.4% as of March 31. Diversity problems: The founder and president of Anthemis Group, Amy Nauiokas, gets a first look at early stage fintech ideas and said, like any good investor, she takes her chances on people, not ideas. So many early stage companies fail that it's important to focus on people's ability to lead a company and foster a culture. And founders are “almost always” men, she pointed out, which is why it’s important to ask every company about their diversity plans. “If you started yesterday… you’re a founder… you don’t fix your problem, I’ve got no time for you,” said Nauiokas (who, incidentally, is an investor in Payoff, the company behind Joy, the all-male run PFM app for women, which you may recall reading about here last week.) “Goldman Sachs has done probably better than anyone at trying to bring more women to the table, but it is a multi-hundred-year-old organization from a time women weren’t in the workforce. We’re living in a different world and there’s no excuse for selling a product to a population that holds more than 50% of purchasing power and not having a female voice on your board or in your C-suite.” Be sure to also read Nauiokas’ BankThink piece on the gender imbalance in the startup sector. The curvy career ladder: TIAA’s Kathie Andrade and BMO Financial’s Ann Marie Wright spoke at the Women in Banking LEAD conference in New York last week sharing their experiences on how to prosper in a challenging market. Advancing at work is often “more like a rock climb than a career ladder,” Andrade said. Sometimes the best move isn't necessarily directly one rung above. Similarly, Wright talked about the importance of considering positions that perhaps aren't part of your own grand plan. If she didn't listen to the people who led her to such opportunities, she wouldn't be where she is now, she said. Kathie Andrade, TIAA’s chief executive officer of retail financial services, spoke at the Most Powerful Women in Banking LEAD conference. Role call HarborOne Bank in Brockton, Mass., announced today that Linda Simmons has been named chief financial officer. Simmons succeeds Joseph Casey, who was appointed president in February. She joins HarborOne from the Cooperative Bank of Cape Cod, where she had been CFO since 2012. She also is a member of the advisory board of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. In case you missed it On the front lines: As technology has changed consumer expectations and lowered their attention spans, banks have a lot of adjusting to do. The onus isn’t just on bank tellers to create deep personal connections with customers. There has to be an effort made in the branch, on the website, in the mobile app, on social media and everywhere else the customer spends time, said Jennifer Breithaupt, Citi’s recently appointed global consumer marketing chief. She also talked about virtual reality and her personal goals with moving into a new role. When bigger isn't better: Citi recently unveiled an agreement with Nasdaq that allows Citi to link its business payments services to Nasdaq's blockchain platform. It’s significant to witness a blockchain solution in the wild — banks often work in large consortia that require agreement by so many parties that it impedes the ability to ship a product quickly. What “helped translate the theoretical thinking to actual application” was to work in a “minimal viable ecosystem” of just a few trusted partners — to be able to get a product to market faster, and focus on scaling the network later, said Morgan McKenney, Asia Pacific head of core cash management, at Citi's treasury and trade solutions arm. “Everyone is used to a minimum viable product, how do you extend that thinking to something that’s going to involve multiple players?” Beyond banking Gender complex: The general thinking is that venture capital firms with female senior investing partners are more likely to invest in companies founded by women. But that is not the case, at least among 17 top venture firms in this Bloomberg analysis. Michelle Zatlyn suggested one reason might be that, with so few women in the industry, they are concerned more with trying to fit in than they are with betting on female-led companies. “For a long time, I didn’t want to be a part of any of the female stories,” said Zatlyn, co-founder and head of user experience at Cloudflare. “I didn’t want to be labeled.” However, now, “It feels like there’s a point of view that’s missing,” she said. Others agreed that their gender helps them see value in different companies. “I consider it a competitive advantage,” said Jess Lee, who joined Sequoia last year after years leading Polyvore, the online fashion company. Compared to her male venture counterparts, “I have an advantage in understanding the female consumer.” Pissing pug: #FearlessGirl was trending on Twitter again this week, after sculptor Alex Gardega — upset about the statue being placed across from Wall Street’s “Charging Bull” — decided to retaliate with a work of his own. Gardega created a statue of a small dog, titled “Pissing Pug,” taking aim at the girl’s left leg. “This is corporate nonsense,” Gardega said of “Fearless Girl,” referring to the fact that it was placed there by State Street Global Advisors. “It has nothing to do with feminism, and it is disrespect to the artist that made the bull.” THIS is DISGUSTING. Peeing on the little girl?! Misogynistic, pathetic bastard. Doesn't deserve the title Artist. #AlexGardenia #pissingpug https://t.co/JMdv0oCQXH — Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) May 30, 2017 Wonder, men: Some men are upset about a women-only screening of the movie “Wonder Woman” at a theater in Austin, Texas.

The estimates from JPMorgan and Bank of America “are reflecting reality and I don’t think we’re very different,” Gorman said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Tom Mackenzie in Beijing. “We all have similar clients, if not the same clients.” Markets revenue at JPMorgan was down about 15 percent in April and May from a year earlier, driven by a slump in fixed income, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said Wednesday at an investor conference in New York. At Bank of America, revenue from the business will be 10% to 12% lower, though first-half results should be stronger, CEO Brian Moynihan said at a separate event.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Share prices of the biggest U.S. banks reportedly are flirting with bear-market territory amid fears of weak trading revenues and fading hopes for President Donald Trump’s ambitious economic agenda. “Goldman Sachs and Bank of America were among the biggest beneficiaries of the stock rally in the weeks after Donald Trump’s election victory in November, as investors looked forward to a profit-boosting mix of higher interest rates, lower taxes and lighter regulation,” the Financial Times reported. “But some of those underpinnings have fallen away since then, as Trump’s early setback over healthcare policy cast doubt over his ability to implement other promised reforms,” the FT explained. Shares in Goldman Sachs dropped 3.3 percent Wednesday, bringing the total fall from its closing high on March 3 to 16.5 percent — within reach of the 20 percent drop that commonly defines a “bear market.” Goldman shares rebounded Thursday, rising more than 1 percent to $214. Share prices of Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have all tumbled more than 10 percent from their post-election peaks, the FT reported. Bank analysts have been switching “blue-sky earnings scenarios” of late last year with “more cloudy” outlooks, Fred Cannon, global director of research at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York, told the FT. He explained that the hopes of corporate tax reform happening any time this year have almost evaporated. “Tax reform was difficult enough in 1986, when you had bipartisan support and an extremely popular president,” he said. “Without either, it always looked like a bit of a long shot.” To be sure, in an even more disturbing sign, CNBC reported that the financial sector "just gave up all of this year's gains, and some strategists say that's sending the broader market a message about the health of the economy." The sector, composed of a range of financial services firms such as insurance companies and banks, was leading the market for part of the year to date and was up 9 percent as of the beginning of March, CNBC explained. The drop is a function of rates falling, along with ongoing concerns about global growth, said Oppenheimer head of technical analysis Ari Wald.  Financials underperforming in a falling-interest-rate environment flashes a "lacking vote of confidence about economic growth," he wrote Wednesday in an email to CNBC. However, many respected economic voices have also urged caution about the liberal mainstream media's biased smear-campaign attacks on Trump, which have hindered full implentation of the president's plans to truly "Make America Great Again." David Horowitz, author of the best-selling book "Big Agenda: President Trump's Plan to Save America," has told Newsmax TV that the market rally since Republican Donald Trump won the election has more room for gains as the president pushes his pro-business agenda. “There's more upside. Starting from when he was president-elect he started this stock market boom,” he recently told “The Income Generation Show.” “I don't think Trump's agenda is going to be stopped in its tracks. What people forget, I mean, it's all this inside-the-beltway chatter, all of it hysterical. The anti-Trump forces are truly deranged. You can't forget how he resonates with the people,” Horowitz said on "The Income Generation," which airs on Newsmax TV every Sunday at 10 am ET. Meanwhile, veteran financial guru and former Ronald Reagan adviser Larry Kudlow is urging any impatient investors to just give Trump a chance to fully enact his strategies to reform healthcare, spark economic growth and redesign the tax system. After all, Trump has been in office a relatively short time and has inherited a mountain of problems from the past two decades. “He's trying to fix a lot of problems that have gone unfixed in the last 20 years,” Kudlow explained to CNBC. Trump “still wants tax reform and healthcare reform. Those are big issues for him.” the Newsmax Finance Insider said. “Give him a chance,” said Kudlow, who advised the Trump campaign on economic issues.

Foreign investors move beyond sovereign debt to issues from banks and corporations The Gulf's market in international bonds is deepening as foreign investors move beyond sovereign debt to issues from banks and corporations - a shift that could change the way some issuers choose to structure their bonds. Traditionally, foreign investors in Gulf debt have focused almost entirely on sovereign bonds because of their greater safety and liquidity. But a surge of sovereign issuance in the past 12 months, as Gulf governments cover budget deficits caused by low oil prices, is changing that pattern. It has put the region on the map for some foreign institutions, making them boost allocations to the six GCC states. Institutions that fail to satisfy their appetite for GCC debt entirely with sovereign bonds look a few notches down the credit rating curve at bank and corporate issuers. Meanwhile, expanded sovereign issuance has created a complete yield curve for the region, making it easier for banks and companies to price bonds at levels which a range of investors accept. "This is a market that attracts both investment grade and emerging market investors," said Hani Deaibes, head of Middle East debt capital markets at JPMorgan. "What is happening is that the large issuances from sovereigns have made this market more relevant to investors. This has increased the interest in corporates and banks from the region. There's more understanding of the market." In 2016, GCC bond volumes totalled a record $69 billion, more than double the usual level since the mid-2000s, Thomson Reuters data shows. Over $40 billion has been issued so far this year. Jumbo sovereign deals include Saudi Arabia's $17.5 billion debut international bond last year, the largest issued in emerging markets, plus an $8 billion bond from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia's $9 billion international sukuk, or Islamic bond, this year. Allocation statistics for at least one recent Gulf issuer suggest the balance of demand by geography and investor type is changing. A $750 million senior secured bond issued in May by Kuwait's largest commercial lender, National Bank of Kuwait, was mostly bought by US-based investors. Some 57 per cent of the paper went to them, followed by Middle East investors with 26 per cent, Europe with 13 per cent and Asia with four per cent. By contrast, 43 per cent of a $700 million bond issued by NBK in 2015 went to Middle East investors; US buyers took only two per cent. "From an emerging markets perspective this region has become more relevant, in particular in the US, simply by virtue of the sheer volumes issued since last year," said Iman Abdel Khalek, Citigroup's head of regional debt capital markets. "NBK has been the first bank to take advantage of this. The pricing outcome was exceptional and was a direct outcome of the bid from US investors, who also bought the Kuwait sovereign bond earlier in the year."

Morgan: Re-Think Business Chatty bots and AI bank managers: getting inside fintech’s future What’s next for the rapidly evolving world of money, banking and finance? The first article in the WIRED / J.P. Morgan Re-Think Business series explores the big trends in fintech’s future 3 days ago In partnership with J.P. Morgan Private Bank Marcus Marritt Thursday 1 June 2017 Fintech might have started life as a buzzword, but now it’s a powerful reality. The ongoing digital revolution and the irresistible rise of technologies such as machine learning and cloud computing are on course to disrupt one of the world’s most complex sectors: banking and financial services.   Tech startups on shoestring budgets are increasingly carving a space for themselves in the financial-services industry, developing apps or online tools that provide new and engaging ways of saving or investing.   Although many recent fintech successes – such as Funding Circle and Transferwise – mainly focused on optimisation rather than wholesale transformation, this is the calm before the storm. Over the next five years financial services are going to be revolutionised, as the sector’s large incumbents seize the opportunity to embrace change.   “Typically, fintech organisations are very mission-driven – they have a single, pinpoint goal and do a great job solving one issue,” says Kelli Keough, ‎global head of digital wealth management at JPMorgan Chase. “The role for large financial institutions is to provide holistic experiences: people still come to large financial institutions asking them to solve multiple financial needs for them, they expect an integrated experience.”   “We think about financial integrated experiences using what we can from fintech companies, by incorporating the great technology they bring to the marketplace.”   Here, we explore four key areas of innovation that are powering today’s fintech insurgency – and explore how they will reshape our financial services of the future.   The bank manager as an AI It comes as no surprise that artificial intelligence (AI) tops the list of potentially disruptive technologies. Vast amounts of processable data and techniques such as machine learning have made it possible to create algorithms capable of outperforming humans at detecting trends, making predictions and taking appropriate action. In the financial sector, legions of smart machines are taking over a wide range of tasks that were once the preserve of human workers.   Robo-traders have been buying and selling stocks for some time (their super-fast reaction times have triggered “flash crashes” on the markets), but in the last few years AIs have also started working as financial-fraud detectives.   “Banks and financial organisations have been pushed by regulators to be more sophisticated in tackling issues such as money laundering and any sort of criminal behaviour,” explains Mark Atherton, vice president for financial services at computer-technology corporation Oracle. “Humans just can't process all the information involved. AI can look at patterns, how money is moved around, and is very good at spotting any sign of suspicious activity. Since an AI learns as it goes, we don't have to programme everything into the system.”   Jörn Leogrande, vice president mobile services at payment platform Wirecard, says that while machine learning still requires humans to be involved in some of the more complex decisions, these tools are increasingly being used for customer-facing activities. “Providers of financial services are using AI to make predictions about customers’ behaviour, which can then be used to push certain products, reduce churn and create market insights for product and brand development,” he says.   Marcus Marritt Rise of the chatty robots Many business units are already in the process of being swarmed by another kind of virtual agent: the chatbot. Easy to access through apps such as Facebook Messenger or Slack, chatbots are algorithms able to process financial information and discuss it with customers in natural written language. Customers can turn to chatbots for such tasks as checking their accounts or tracking expenses. ADVERTISEMENT “Chatbots can help banks lower the cost of advice and support for customers,” explains Harry Armstrong, head of futures at London-based think tank Nesta. “The ability to access and process large amounts of data and provide services and advice on the back of it could help consumers better navigate between different products and offers. This could potentially help people manage their finances in better ways.” The industry-wide chatbot bandwagon is picking up momentum, partly because chatbots are perceived as a way to engage with younger generations—who as a demographic cohort don’t think too much about saving. That is why Mastercard and Capital One have both launched conversational agents which provide 24/7 customer service at the tap of a finger; and consultancy Accenture has forecast that chatbots will become the primary way for customers to interact with banks within three years – it’s also released a proof-of-concept virtual mortgage adviser, named Colette. Chetan Dube, president and CEO of IPsoft, which created a cognitive agent called Amelia, explains that customer-service-by-bot is just the start. “Chatbots were initially incorporated to provide limited FAQ support, but we now see sophisticated virtual agents such as Amelia taking on full advisory and service support roles,” he says. “Importantly this evolution places emphasis on virtual agents to understand a wider ranging and more complex conversation and independently determine the right steps to take in order to execute a request, end to end. “ Amelia cut her teeth on an internal tech-support desk, but has since migrated to front of house, where she now talks to customers. ADVERTISEMENT The blockchain: boom or bust? If chatbots are going to be taking over financial institutions’ front desks, another technology – one that was, ironically, originated by an online anarcho-libertarian effort – is destined to radically alter the back end. Enter the blockchain, the digital scaffolding for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The blockchain is a distributed virtual ledger running on thousands of machines, on which every transaction is immutably recorded by network consensus. These transactions originally involved bitcoins, but the same infrastructure can be leveraged to reliably and securely exchange any kind of assets, from bonds to equities. Banks, insurers and other financial institutions have already started investing in blockchain-technology research and are excited about the ledger’s potential uses. One obvious advantage is the speeding up of procedures such as interbank transfers, which can be lengthy, involve lots of paperwork and can require intermediaries. The blockchain promises to be a tamper-proof, speedy way to carry out that task – and cut out the middleman in the process. ADVERTISEMENT Its supporters argue that its areas of application – from faster, fee-free international payments to credit-score automation and certification of digital-asset ownership – are endless. “Things like insurance and risk management will change profoundly. By using reputation systems based on a person’s economic and social capital, insurers will be able to make better-informed decisions,” explain Don Tapscott and Alex Tapscott, co-authors of Blockchain Revolution and co-founders of the Blockchain Research Institute. “Or think of the OTC [over-the-counter] derivatives market: it has a notional value of $600 trillion [£469tn], but is paper-based, opaque and relies too heavily on centralised clearing houses. Moving all derivatives to the blockchain would reduce counter-party risk and systemic risk by making settlements instant and transparent.” Over time, the blockchain could have another, systemic, effect: allowing banks and financial-service providers to dramatically expand their client base. “Blockchain embeds trust into financial systems, providing transparency without sacrificing privacy and information security,” says Jesse Lund, vice president for global blockchain market development at IBM. “Improved transparency will promote trust between consumers and institutions and help increase the financial inclusion of nearly half of the world’s population who remain ‘unbanked’.”   Its detractors, however, claim that blockchain systems aren’t scalable, and that the sector is underfunded by wary VCs. However it pans out, the Bitcoin back-end isn’t going away any time soon. Marcus Marritt Keeping the bad guys out The irresistible rise of fintech is exciting, but it also presents challenges. Distributed ledgers and blockchain-like networks have to carefully balance security and decentralisation with the need for privacy and scale banks need (the original Bitcoin blockchain is publicly visible and can manage about seven transactions per second). AI and cognitive agents will vastly benefit the industry, but seeing them as a panacea has its risks, as Douglas Merrill, CEO and founder of machine-learning-driven underwriting platform ZestFinance, explains. “As the human brain experiences blind spots, so too is AI prone to certain errors,” he says. “We often see this with data: you can deploy the best machine-learning models, but if they’re trained on bad data, they’ll produce bad results.” Beyond that, the digitisation of banking and finance has another consequence: hackers and cyberattackers will have the capacity to inflict damage on a much larger scale than before. “While security breaches in other sectors can have devastating consequences for both the company and the consumer, these consequences are often limited to loss of data and consumer confidence,” explains Alex Rice, co-founder of cybersecurity firm HackerOne. “The financial sector does not have that luxury: insecure services hit their bottom line and threatens the livelihood of the impacted consumer. When it comes to security, the stakes are among the highest in the financial sector.”   New threats, Rice continues, go from “boutique malware” – such as the virus which cheated a Bangladeshi bank of $81 million through a compromised SWIFT terminal – to phishing and ATM skimming. The recent attack on the NHS also showed how vulnerable public institutions are to ransomware. But the fintech sector is responding. Solutions range from AI-fuelled cybersecurity tools to stronger encryption and bug bounties – rewards for the finder of a vulnerability in an institution’s system. Yet, one of the more effective ways to pre-empt disaster (or handling it adequately), Rice says, is sharing information among financial-services providers themselves. ADVERTISEMENT “Financial-services companies were some of the first to embrace and leverage information sharing to powerful effect,” he explains. “In the US, the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center has significantly improved the security posture of the sector by openly sharing best practices and lessons learned from attacks.” Fintech has become part of the mainstream infrastructure and is likely to evolve quickly and splinter into even more financial sub-sectors. So, it is crucial for those involved in financial services to be aware of new developments and risks – ultimately, to get inside fintech’s future. - For more from J.P.
