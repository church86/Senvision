Live updates Sort posts by Newest Oldest 4:30pm on 4 Jan 2017 That's it for today - thanks for reading and posting your comments. We'll be back tomorrow from 9am. 4:29pm on 4 Jan 2017 Investors lost some of their new year exuberance sending the ASX only marginally higher, as gains in financials and Telstra offset losses in the energy and utilities sectors.  The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index and the broader All Ordinaries Index each closed up 0.06 per cent to 5736.4 points and 5788.2 points respectively.  Investors are turning wary of the recent record highs attained on Wall Street and the buoyant ASX, which hit a 2016 high just before Christmas, as the inauguration of Donald Trump as President of the United States looms.  "Markets have been rallying quite strongly on this notion of fiscal hope but, as we move into the reality of 2017 and what a Trump presidency will actually look like, there is some risk of fiscal disappointment," said Paul Eitelman, strategist at Russell Investments. "Any disappointment at this point could be a source of downside risk for markets from here, so we're incrementally being a bit more cautious." A slight tumble in the iron ore price weighed on Rio Tinto, which closed down 0.9 per cent, while BHP Billiton and Fortescue Metals found buying support, closing up 0.6 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively.  There was broad based buying in the big four banks, which all closed up between 0.5 and 0.9 per cent. Investors also piled into Telstra, boosting the stock 0.4 per cent.  Gold was trading marginally higher but a strong finish on Tuesday night was enough to prompt some buying support for the likes of Newcest Mining, Australia's largest gold producer, which closed up 0.8 per cent and Evolution Mining, which bumped up 1.4 per cent. 4:04pm on 4 Jan 2017 Banks hiking mortgage interest rates out of cycle and failing to pass on official rate cuts are expected to dampen demand for housing this year, according to a new report. The REA Group Property Demand Index shows demand for housing on the company's realestate.com.au website peaked last year in October and November, before slipping by 6.6 per cent in December. REA Group chief economist Nerida Conisbee said the fall in demand at the end of the year is likely due to banks hiking rates in late November and early December. She said demand could track lower given that lenders have indicated they won't pass possible Reserve Bank rate cuts onto borrowers. "We expect out-of-cycle interest rate rises by banks to continue," Conisbee said. "This will be a key issue for borrowers this year, especially first home buyers and investors, with access to cheap money becoming more difficult." Out-of-cycle rate hikes are set to continue, says REA Group. Photo: Karl Hilzinger 3:38pm on 4 Jan 2017 Underneath the blistering outperformance of iron ore and coking coal during 2016, some lesser-known commodities also staged handsome price rises. Zinc was one of the best performers, surging 75 per cent year-on-year thanks to tightening supply, while uranium was one of the few base metals to close the year lower than where it started. Agricultural commodities, such as pork, jumped 22 per cent in December after five months of steep declines, with palm oil hitting a four-year high after a 9 per cent gain in December thanks to supply concerns out of Malaysia. "For many metals and energy products, the rally in prices has been particularly supported by a pullback in supply," said Paul Bloxham, chief economist at HSBC Australia, He noted that business investment had dried up as producers reacted to low prices. He pointed to a devastating plunge in broad-based commodity prices in early 2016 as the catalyst for some companies to put the brakes on production. "Decisions by OPEC, a pullback in investment by major energy and mining companies plus ongoing reform in China to reduce excess capacity have all contributed to the commodity price rally," Bloxham said. Zinc enjoyed a significant price hike as supply growth dwindled thanks to the closure of the Century zinc mine in Queensland in late 2015 and the Lisheen mine in Ireland. While the price has soared, Australian listed zinc plays have responded only modestly.

However, once rates start rising, pressure on household finances is due to increase, which is probably why the RBA has been sounding a bit more concerned about debt levels of late. Back to top 3:04pm on 4 Jan 2017 Bellamy's Australia is facing a fresh set of problems with a major shareholder group believed to be backed by Jan Cameron looking to spill the board and install herself along with three others as non-executive directors. The Singapore-based Black Prince Private Foundation, believed to be a holding company for Ms Cameron's interest at 14.48 per cent, is seeking to dump four non-executive directors including former Billabong CEO Launa Inman, Patria Mann, Michael Wadley and Charles Sitch. ​The foundation proposes that Kathmandu founder Jan Cameron, Chan Wai-Chan, Vaughan Webber and Black Prince representative, Rodd Peters, be appointed to the board. The request comes amid a lengthy suspension to the trading in shares of the company as it seeks to renegotiate supply agreements. However the chairman of Bellamy's, Rob Woolley, said the proposal to shake up the board is an "unwanted distraction". "If the proposals were to succeed, it would be disruptive to the company," he said. More turmoil ... Bellamy's chairman Rob Woolley is opposed to a move to force out several of its directors. Photo: Jessica Hromas 2:37pm on 4 Jan 2017 There are growing concerns that the rally in the global oil market, which has seen prices hurtle to an 18-month high, could be stalling amid doubts whether major oil producers will achieve their ambition of bringing an end to the painful supply glut that has weighed on the market for the past two years. Oil enjoyed its biggest annual gain since the financial crisis in 2016 with the price of Brent, the global benchmark, rising 52 per cent, while US crude finished the year up 45 per cent. Oil prices were lifted by hopes that the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), along with other oil-producing countries such as Russia, would follow through on their agreement to cut output by 1.8 million barrels a day – or almost 2 per cent of global output. But some traders are sceptical whether OPEC members will abide by the deal which hopes to end the global oil supply glut that has weighed on the market for two years and pushed the oil price to a decade low of $US26 a barrel in early 2016. Although oil prices rose in early trading overnight, boosted by local media reports that Kuwait was adhering to the OPEC deal by cutting its output by 130,000 barrels a day, oil futures finished lower. Brent crude finished down 2.4 per cent at $US55.47 a barrel. It's up 0.6 per cent at $US55.81 in Asian trade today. Reports that major oil companies are flocking to develop oil and gas reserves in Iran after the lifting of international sanctions did little to boost confidence that the OPEC deal will stick. Several media outlets in Tehran reported on Tuesday that 29 European and Asian companies – although no US groups – had been selected to participate in tenders planned for this year to develop oil and gas reserves in Iran. In addition, traders pointed out that the output cuts only begin this month and it could take several months before they cause high inventory levels to fall. Others noted that Trump's promise to boost the nation's oil and natural gas production by scrapping environmental regulations could lead to a surge in US production.

The Aussie is buying US72.33¢, after falling as low as US71.63¢ last week. Traders said there was some relief that a feared rush of capital out of China had yet to eventuate, with Beijing slapping tighter controls on foreign currency purchases over the weekend. The Aussie is often used as a liquid proxy for the yuan and had been under pressure recently on worries the yuan would come under pressure when China's individual annual quota for foreign currency purchases was reset this week. The Aussie lost 2.8 per cent in January last year when the yuan tumbled amid heavy capital outflows. "Of course these are early days, but to the extent that the news eases concerns of a possible repeat of last January's China's equity and CNY meltdown, that is good news for China and the AUD," said Rodrigo Catril, currency strategist at National Australia Bank. Still, the yuan remains under pressure, trading just below 7 per US dollar, but the falls have been more gradual over the past months, and they've been mostly shrugged off by sharemarkets as the following chart shows: This chart (of $SPX vs $USDCNY) was fun for a while... pic.twitter.com/V5Z9s5t7B9— Topdown Charts (@topdowncharts) January 4, 2017 1:41pm on 4 Jan 2017 Hunter Hall has established an independent board committee to consider a takeover bid from investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson, which Hunter Hall says is at a material discount to the company's current share price. WHSP announced on December 30 that it intends to acquire all of the shares in the ASX-listed investment manager that it does not already own, after agreeing to buy a stake of 19.9 per cent from Hunter Hall chief executive Peter Hall, who is also the largest shareholder. Hall, who controls 43.95 per cent of Hunter Hall shares, has told WHSP that he intends to accept its offer for his remaining stake of 25.05 per cent unless there is a superior offer. WHSP is offering $1.00 per Hunter Hall share, which values the target at about $27.3 million. Hunter Hall shares are down 1.2 per cent at $2.47, their third straight day of losses after the company confirmed Hall is stepping down and selling his stake. "The WHSP takeover offer of $1.00 represents a material discount to Hunter Hall's prevailing share price, being a 67.7 per cent discount to HHL's share price prior to close on 30 December, 2016," Hunter Hall said today, adding that, given the nature of the WHSP offer and Mr Hall's direct involvement, the Hunter Hall board had established an independent board committee (IBC). Hunter Hall said its shareholders need take no action at this time, and the independent board committee would provide updates when appropriate. Peter Hall's surprise stake sale and resignation as CEO and chief investment officer has shocked investors. Photo: Domino Postiglione 12:55pm on 4 Jan 2017 Former US Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said investors are being far too sanguine about the risks associated with Donald Trump's incoming administration. The Harvard professor, a Democrat who was Treasury chief under Bill Clinton, cited the possibility of protectionist measures by the US as well as changes to foreign policy and domestic social policy as issues that are creating "extraordinary uncertainty". With just over two weeks to go before Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, the S&P 500 is close to a record high, having risen almost 10 percent in 2016 on optimism over fiscal stimulus and stronger economic growth. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average has struggled to close at the 20,000 level, it rose 13 percent last year. "This is probably the largest transition ideologically and in terms of substantive policy that we've seen in the US in the last three quarters of a century," Summers said. "Those kinds of transitions have to be -- given the central role of the US in the global system -- matters of enormous uncertainty. I don't think that's fully recognised by markets." Summers was also critical of a paper jointly written by economist Peter Navarro, who will lead a newly formed White House National Trade Council, and Commerce Department head Wilbur Ross. "The Navarro-Ross paper is well beyond voodoo economics," Summers said of the September report on Trump's growth plans. "The logic of it, the arguments made, are so far out of the mainstream of any kind of responsible economic thinking that they are the economic equivalent of creationism." Summers dismissed the idea that any tax policy introduced to encourage US companies to repatriate profits would boost investment and hiring. "The vast majority of the companies who have large overseas cash also have substantial amounts of domestic cash," he said. "The reality is that cash that is brought home will be used to pay dividends, to buy back shares, to engage in mergers and acquisitions, to rearrange the financial chessboard, not to invest in large amounts of new capital. It is a chimera to suppose that there will be large increases in capital investment as a consequence of that repatriation." Lawrence "Larry" Summers, former US Treasury secretary, reckons markets are underestimating the risks of a Trump presidency. Photo: Kiyoshi Ota Back to top 12:55pm on 4 Jan 2017 Australia's east coast-centric housing boom will roll on in 2017 but could become unstuck in 2018, according to SQM Research founder Louis Christopher, arguably the country's most accurate forecaster. Christopher expects capital city house prices to rise between 6 and 10 per cent this year, led by double-digit price growth in Sydney, Melbourne and possibly Hobart. There will be single-digit growth in the other capital cities, apart from Perth and Darwin where further steep falls are predicted. "It is now very likely it will be a strong start to the new year for Sydney and Melbourne, given the way 2016 ended," he said. Looking ahead to 2018 the picture is gloomier, according to Christopher. He believes both Sydney and Melbourne's housing markets will be "dangerously overheated and overvalued" by the end of 2017, paving the way for a possible correction. His forecasts for 2017 are under a base case scenario of a steady economy, no changes to the cash rate, the Australian dollar hovering between 70¢ and 80¢ and no meddling in bank lending by the Australian Prudential Authority in the first six months of the year. Should the Reserve Bank cut the cash rate again next year, house price growth could be even greater. His forecasts are worth noting. Over the past two years Christopher has predicted capital city house price growth in line with the Australian Bureau of Statistics's Residential Property Price Index.

Here's a taste: AFR: What's the outlook for commodities? King: Let's consider those most important to the Australian economy – coal and iron ore. No view on commodities can be complete without first considering what has happened and what will happen in China. To shore up its growth targets for the year, the Chinese government has continued its fiscal and credit stimulus which has boosted construction and hence steel demand. The other major contributor to commodity prices has been the domestic cuts to production of iron ore and coal in China – this is largely on environmental grounds and also reflects the need to rationalise capacity and remove debt overhang. As a result, we believe these shutdowns are permanent. Thus there is a structural, rather than simply cyclical, increase in demand for Australian commodities. Our outlook is for some slowing of China housing construction in 2017 but we don't expect production cuts there to be reversed. Therefore we expect some softening in commodity prices from their elevated levels at the end of 2016 – but by no means a complete reversal to their levels of early 2016. There's persistent talk of a housing collapse? What's ahead for the Australian property market? Our base case is that we will see a mild downturn in the annual growth of house prices in 2017 and 2018. The risk to this view would be one where oversupply (in particular in Brisbane and Melbourne) causes units to face a price correction, which then leads to contagion to house prices more generally. This is certainly a risk we need to keep an eye on in 2017 but, for now, we don't see it as highly probable for several reasons. First, units in Australia represent less than 20 per cent of the total housing stock and limited land release has meant demand/supply conditions have remained tight for houses. Second, units are not direct substitutes for houses so the contagion channel isn't clear-cut. Finally, interest rates are low but, unlike many countries, still have room to move lower if the RBA needs to step in to ensure a more orderly housing correction. We will continue to watch developments in China closely as further tightening of capital controls could exacerbate price falls in the unit market, heightening the contagion risk.

Though underlying price pressures remain weak, the data may embolden European Central Bank hawks who argue the euro-area economy is on a firmer footing, justifying a shift away from loose monetary policies. Analysts at Societe Generale reckon ECB tapering fears are likely to haunt markets once more in the second half of the year.  The first reduction in the ECB's asset purchase program, announced in December, will take place in April 2017. "We then expect a gradual tapering of 10 billion euros to continue as of June 2017, with reductions of €10bn per meeting, assuming our forecasts hold steady, but also in view of the legal problems of raising the issue limit." 11:35am on 4 Jan 2017 The Turkish lira hit a fresh record low, pummelled by higher-than-expected inflation and security worries after militant attacks The lira sank to an all-time low of 3.6 per US dollar after sharp rises in food and drink prices pushed annual inflation to 8.53 per cent last month, 53 basis points above one of the nation's key interest rates. That erodes the yield on Turkish assets already under pressure from growing security concerns and adds pressure on the central bank to raise borrowing costs. "The inflation number is worse than expected ... it's an awful number and obviously there is a lag of months before the full effect of lira depreciation ... is reflected, so one would expect core inflation to remain high from here," said Paul Fage, an emerging market strategist at TD Securities. ​The currency's depreciation since end-September calls for at least 200 basis points of rate hikes just to keep the real rate stable," said Inan Demir, an economist at Nomura. "To beef up real yield support for the lira, the magnitude of the hikes will have to be larger." The central bank, which is under government pressure to ease borrowing costs to spur economic growth even when inflation is still well above its target, raised the top end of its three-pronged interest rate corridor 25 basis points in November. That month, it also boosted the one-week repurchase rate 50 basis points to 8 per cent for the first time since 2014. Fage noted that a presidential adviser had said a rate hike would "break the economy's back", implying intense pressure on the central bank to avoid much-needed rate hikes. "It's unlikely they will do the big emergency hikes they did in the past and if they do hike it will be the order of 25-50 bps," he added. Sharp rises in food prices have pushed Turkish inflation above 8 per cent.  11:08am on 4 Jan 2017 Alumina shares have dropped 1.8 per cent to $1.81 after the company outlined the size of the hit it will take from charges related to its AWAC joint venture's closure of an alumina refinery and bauxite mines in Suriname as well as an impairment of interest in a Western Australia gas field. The recently announced closure of the Suriname operations - a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina - will result in total restructuring-related charges of $108 million and related cash costs of $181 million over five years from 2017. Alumina said its share of the charges and costs will be $43 million and $72 million respectively, while it will bear another $21 million of a $52 million charge related to the Perth basin gas field impairment.Back to top 10:43am on 4 Jan 2017 Remember the biggest market scare headline from January 2016: The Royal Bank of Scotland's "sell everything!" alarm? And the $10,000 bet Steven Koukoulas tried to make against the RBS analyst? Well now the tables have turned and "The Kouk" is the bear, Michael Pascoe says: Funny thing about the RBS analyst who made the "edge of a cataclysm" call – he seems to have disappeared. After advising RBS clients they should sell everything except high-quality government bonds, Andrew Roberts hasn't turned up on a Google search since. I've gone through several pages of searches but there's been nothing fresh from Mr Roberts since that headline-grabbing advice. If he was out to get publicity, he was certainly successful, featuring in stories around the world. Embarrassingly, much of the coverage was uncritical or even barely sceptical. Hey, fear sells. But not everyone was unquestioning. Stephen Koukoulas of Market Economics, alias The Kouk, went a step further than expressing doubt by immediately calling Roberts out, prepared to bet 10 grand that at least six of 11 markets Roberts indicated as losers would in fact rise. Koukoulas never heard from Roberts, but he kept score anyway. As it has turned out, all 11 of the nominated markets finished in the black, averaging a stunning gain of 29.6 per cent with the US dollar iron ore price the best performer, up 85.9 per cent. Roberts wasn't just wrong, he was stunningly wrong. In the pantheon of failed Doomsday forecasts, he's at the top table with Marc Faber and whoever it is who has been advertising "The Crash of Next Year" for the past several years. But in a twist to the bulls versus bears game, now it's the Kouk who has turned cautious, predicting Australian and global stocks will fall, commodity prices will drop, including a halving of the coal price, and he's tipping Australian unemployment to finish this year at 6 per cent despite the Reserve Bank cutting interest rates two more times. Sell everything? Not such a good idea in 2016. Photo: Stephen Koukoulas 10:28am on 4 Jan 2017 Local shares have opened marginally higher, feeding off continuing bullish sentiment in the market. The ASX is up 0.1 per cent at 5739.3 and the All Ords has added 0.1 per cent to 5791.2. "The fact that the index closed at its high after a 1.2 per cent rally yesterday hints at the possibility of unsatisfied buying," says CMC chief market analyst Ric Spooner. "Against this, traders will be weighing a soft overnight session for commodities, especially oil and a positive session for precious metals, neither of which suggest strong 'risk on sentiment' for this morning's session." The big banks and Telstra are propping up the benchmark index, with CBA's 0.6 per cent gain the biggest tailwind. Fortescue is up 1.2 per cent despite a dip in the iron ore price overnight, while Rio has dropped 0.7 per cent and South32 is down 0.5 per cent. Gold miners are rebounding from yesterday's losses, after the precious metal's price rose overnight. Newcrest has added 1 per cent. 10:10am on 4 Jan 2017 Iron ore has a tough act to follow in 2017. After surging last year in a rally that caught out many investors, the commodity faces a challenge as supply concerns re-emerge, with Vale bringing on the industry's biggest project and holdings at China's ports at a record level. Seaborne supply is expected to remain strong on shipments from Vale's newly completed S11D project in Brazil, and as miners look to take advantage of current prices, according to Tan Hui Heng, a Singapore-based analyst at Marex Spectron. That, coupled with slowing demand, may hurt iron ore, he said, joining banks including Morgan Stanley in expecting a retreat. Iron ore soared 81 per cent in 2016 in a year when low-cost supply had been expected to rise further amid tepid consumption, hurting prices. Instead, stimulus in China helped sustain steel output, and that, along with speculative interest and record coal prices, fuelled the rally. Better demand and a more restrained approach by top miners Rio Tinto and Vale are likely to carry into this year, limiting losses, according to Clarksons Platou Securities. This year "will bring more supply than current pricing can handle, so pricing should see downward pressure from the current $US80 a tonne levels", Jeremy Sussman, an analyst at Clarksons, said. "Nevertheless, we expect it to be a gradual decline rather than a crash that many are still calling for." The iron ore spot price fell 1.2 per cent to $US77.91 a tonne on the first trading day in 2017, not far off a two-year high of $US83.58 hit on December 12. The rally supercharged miners' shares in 2016, with Rio 34 per cent higher and Vale more than doubling. The holdings at ports in the largest buyer, one gauge of supply, surged 22 per cent last year for the biggest annual gain since 2011. In the final week of 2016, they expanded 2.7 per cent to 113.95 million tonnes, according to Shanghai Steelhome Information Technology Co. That's the highest level on record. "If history is any precedent, record stocks at Chinese ports carry an ominous sign," Axiom Capital Management analyst Gordon Johnson and senior associate James Bardowski wrote in a January 2 note. Axiom predicts prices will drop to $US61 if inventories fall just half as much as in the last down cycle. Prices should remain about $US70 to $US80 in the early part of 2017, with a gradual easing toward the $US50-$US60 range by mid-year, according to Gavin Wendt, founding director and senior resource analyst at MineLife. The drop would come as supply better balances with demand, Wendt said. Iron ore stockpiles in China are at worryingly high levels. Photo: Dado Galdieri 10:04am on 4 Jan 2017 SPONSORED POST The open of the Asian markets promises to be a fairly drab affair, with our call for the ASX 200 sitting up three points, IG's Chris Weston writes: Turnover through the Aussie market was predicably terrible yesterday at $3.74 billion (38% below the 30-day average) and that will likely be the case again today, although I'd expect turnover north of $4 billion. BHP's ADR is largely unchanged, if we use the mining heavyweight as a proxy for the space, and I would expect banks to open ever so slightly stronger. The trend in the ASX 200 is strong though and moves into 5700 should be supported and looking at the daily chart there are no red flags warranting more aggressive short positions just yet. Happy to stay long for now. In terms of volatility the commodities space has been interesting, and there seems to have been somewhat of a move from energy into precious metals. US crude basically collapsed close to 5% after hitting $US55.00 in mid-US trade and technically looks to be putting in a double top. A move through $US52 could be on the cards if we get a poor weekly inventory report (tonight 03:00 aest), with the market expecting a drawdown of 1.38 million barrels. Surprisingly the S&P 500 energy sector is still strong on the day and it will be interesting to see if Aussie energy plays can hold up this morning. Precious metals have seen a good level of short covering, and my preference in this space has been to be long platinum and this trade has been working well, with price gaining over 4%. Technically we have seen price break out of multi-month wedge pattern and $US1000 to $US1020 would be my target here. We can also look at seasonality and see that that platinum has gained for 13 of the last 15 January's, with views that traditionally car manufacturers tend to receive budgets in January and buy volumes of PGM in this window. There tends to be a fall in production as well during this period which supports price. Here's more 9:29am on 4 Jan 2017 Manufacturing output in China, the UK and the US is recovering at a steady pace, boosting hopes for the global economy days into the new year. Factories have struggled around the world the past few years in an environment of goods-price deflation, according to economists at JPMorgan, which today released its global manufacturing PMI for December, up 0.4 points to 53.8, its best level since 2014.  "The latest output PMI reading implies global production growth at a 3.7 per cent annualised pace based on the historical relationship," JPMorgan said. "This would mark a dramatic improvement over the recent past. In 2015 and 1H16, output gains averaged just 1.1 per cent annualised."  JPMorgan said a recovery in pricing power and expected gains in profits and spending are "expected to give a major boost to manufacturing output in our forecast, which calls for 2.5 per cent average gains in 2017". First on the mark this week was China. Its factory activity picked up more than expected in December as demand accelerated, with output reaching a near six-year high, a private business survey showed, giving the manufacturing sector a solid boost heading into 2017. The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' index (PMI) rose to 51.9 on a seasonally adjusted basis, from 50.9 in November and easily beating analysts' forecasts of 50.7. After a rocky start to the year, China's economy looks set to hit Beijing's 2016 growth target of 6.5 to 7 per cent, after expanding 6.7 per cent for each of the first three quarters. British manufacturing grew at its fastest pace in two and a half years last month, adding to signs that the economy ended 2016 strongly despite the shock of June's Brexit vote. The Markit/CIPS UK Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) rose to 56.1, the strongest reading since June 2014, from 53.6 in November, helped by orders from home and abroad. Britain's economy has fared much better than many economists predicted since the vote to leave the European Union, with consumer spending strong and companies performing well. IHS Markit's eurozone PMIs showed manufacturing growth there hit a more than five-year high, similarly boosted by an influx of new orders. US factory activity accelerated to a two-year high in December amid a surge in new orders and rapidly rising raw material prices, indicating that some of the drag on manufacturing from prolonged dollar strength and a slump in oil prices was fading. Other data on Tuesday showed US construction spending hit a 10-1/2-year high in November, providing a boost to a fourth-quarter economic growth estimate. The reports suggested President-elect Donald Trump would inherit a strong economy, with a labour market that is near full employment, from the Obama administration. "The economy is ending the year on a high note with even the manufacturing sector showing signs of faster growth. It appears that President (Barack) Obama will be leaving his successor with a pretty good economy," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Business News | Tue Jan 3, 2017 | 2:19pm EST Indonesia penalizes JPMorgan for negative report in latest emerging markets skirmish A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files By Nilufar Rizki, Eveline Danubrata and David Henry | JAKARTA/NEW YORK JAKARTA/NEW YORK Indonesia has cut some ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) after the bank's research analysts issued a negative report on the country, the latest in a series of skirmishes between Wall Street banks and governments in emerging markets. Indonesia will no longer use JPMorgan as a primary bond dealer and has also revoked a special designation that allows it to perform certain banking services, Suahasil Nazara, head of the Ministry of Finance's fiscal policy office, told Reuters on Tuesday. It is the second time recently that JPMorgan's research arm has drawn ire from the Indonesian government, and highlights the inevitable conflicts banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or company that their investment bankers are trying to court. In other cases, banks have altered research reports, lost lucrative contracts or parted ways with analysts following controversies about their negative opinions. JPMorgan did the right thing by not backing down from its report, said Roy C. Smith, a finance and management professor at New York University's business school. The bank stands to lose relatively little in Indonesia, where it does not have much financial exposure. "(It's) a mistake by Indonesia, which needs JPMorgan's support and advice more than the bank needs Indonesia," Smith said. "No effort by governments unhappy with research calls to 'discipline' the banks have been successful, though efforts are made from time to time to satisfy local political expectations." Global banks made changes to how they perform research in 2003, after a sweeping settlement with then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and U.S. regulators. They erected hard barriers between analysts and bankers and altered compensation structures to prevent conflicts of interest from affecting research. But the conflicts persist. Although pressure is usually less explicit than what JPMorgan faces in Indonesia, banks ranging from Morgan Stanley (MS.N) in China to Banco Santander (SAN.MC) in Brazil have faced similar rows with governments in emerging markets. In JPMorgan's case, analysts led by Adrian Mowat downgraded their investment recommendation on Indonesia stocks to "underweight" from "overweight" in a Nov. 13 note, and also downgraded Brazil equities to "neutral." They cited higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, predicting that higher volatility might stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets. The analysts characterized the recommendation as merely a "tactical" response to Trump's victory. They noted that economies in both Indonesia and Brazil are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017. Nazara, of Indonesia's finance ministry, said JPMorgan's analysis "did not make sense" because it gave Brazil a better rating than Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. "We have asked them to clarify their assessment," Nazara said. "They've explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies." "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. After performing what Nazara described as a "comprehensive review," Indonesia decided to drop JPMorgan as a primary dealer and a so-called perception bank. A 2006 government decree says perception banks are appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. "The impact on our clients is minimal, and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," she said by email. JPMorgan strategists have had a "neutral" recommendation on emerging market government bonds, including those of Indonesia, since before the election, a JPMorgan spokesman said. Robert Pakpahan, Indonesia's director general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters on Tuesday that JPMorgan's research should not have a major impact on Indonesia's future bond issuance, but the sanction on JPMorgan would remain in place "until we say otherwise." In 2015, Indonesia's then-finance minister said that JPMorgan had been "sanctioned" for a negative report recommending less exposure to government bonds, but did not explain what the sanctions involved. [reut.rs/2iF58uK] Banks have encountered a variety of problems managing conflicts in emerging markets. In another high-profile skirmish in 2006, Morgan Stanley's head economist in Asia, Andy Xie, left the bank after a critical email he sent about Singapore was leaked. In 2014, Banco Santander publicly fired an analyst who had published a critical note about Brazil's economic policies. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) lost a lucrative underwriting mandate for South Korea's Kookmin Bank [KOOKM.UL] in 2008 after one of its analysts issued a sell recommendation on the shares. More recently, Goldman has been embroiled in a scandal regarding the way it courted Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund, while JPMorgan has faced probes into its hiring children of Chinese officials to gain an edge in the country.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Money News | Wed Jan 4, 2017 | 2:01am IST Indonesia penalizes JPMorgan for negative report in latest emerging markets skirmish A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files By Nilufar Rizki, Eveline Danubrata and David Henry | JAKARTA/NEW YORK JAKARTA/NEW YORK Indonesia has cut some ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) after the bank's research analysts issued a negative report on the country, the latest in a series of skirmishes between Wall Street banks and governments in emerging markets. Indonesia will no longer use JPMorgan as a primary bond dealer and has also revoked a special designation that allows it to perform certain banking services, Suahasil Nazara, head of the Ministry of Finance's fiscal policy office, told Reuters on Tuesday. It is the second time recently that JPMorgan's research arm has drawn ire from the Indonesian government, and highlights the inevitable conflicts banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or company that their investment bankers are trying to court. In other cases, banks have altered research reports, lost lucrative contracts or parted ways with analysts following controversies about their negative opinions. JPMorgan did the right thing by not backing down from its report, said Roy C. Smith, a finance and management professor at New York University's business school. The bank stands to lose relatively little in Indonesia, where it does not have much financial exposure. "(It's) a mistake by Indonesia, which needs JPMorgan's support and advice more than the bank needs Indonesia," Smith said. "No effort by governments unhappy with research calls to 'discipline' the banks have been successful, though efforts are made from time to time to satisfy local political expectations." Global banks made changes to how they perform research in 2003, after a sweeping settlement with then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and U.S. regulators. They erected hard barriers between analysts and bankers and altered compensation structures to prevent conflicts of interest from affecting research. But the conflicts persist. Although pressure is usually less explicit than what JPMorgan faces in Indonesia, banks ranging from Morgan Stanley (MS.N) in China to Banco Santander (SAN.MC) in Brazil have faced similar rows with governments in emerging markets. In JPMorgan's case, analysts led by Adrian Mowat downgraded their investment recommendation on Indonesia stocks to "underweight" from "overweight" in a Nov. 13 note, and also downgraded Brazil equities to "neutral." They cited higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, predicting that higher volatility might stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets. The analysts characterized the recommendation as merely a "tactical" response to Trump's victory. They noted that economies in both Indonesia and Brazil are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017. Nazara, of Indonesia's finance ministry, said JPMorgan's analysis "did not make sense" because it gave Brazil a better rating than Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. "We have asked them to clarify their assessment," Nazara said. "They've explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies." "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. After performing what Nazara described as a "comprehensive review," Indonesia decided to drop JPMorgan as a primary dealer and a so-called perception bank. A 2006 government decree says perception banks are appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. "The impact on our clients is minimal, and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," she said by email. JPMorgan strategists have had a "neutral" recommendation on emerging market government bonds, including those of Indonesia, since before the election, a JPMorgan spokesman said. Robert Pakpahan, Indonesia's director general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters on Tuesday that JPMorgan's research should not have a major impact on Indonesia's future bond issuance, but the sanction on JPMorgan would remain in place "until we say otherwise." In 2015, Indonesia's then-finance minister said that JPMorgan had been "sanctioned" for a negative report recommending less exposure to government bonds, but did not explain what the sanctions involved.

In another high-profile skirmish in 2006, Morgan Stanley's head economist in Asia, Andy Xie, left the bank after a critical email he sent about Singapore was leaked.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Business News | Tue Jan 3, 2017 | 2:19pm EST Indonesia penalizes JPMorgan for negative report in latest emerging markets skirmish A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files By Nilufar Rizki, Eveline Danubrata and David Henry | JAKARTA/NEW YORK JAKARTA/NEW YORK Indonesia has cut some ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) after the bank's research analysts issued a negative report on the country, the latest in a series of skirmishes between Wall Street banks and governments in emerging markets. Indonesia will no longer use JPMorgan as a primary bond dealer and has also revoked a special designation that allows it to perform certain banking services, Suahasil Nazara, head of the Ministry of Finance's fiscal policy office, told Reuters on Tuesday. It is the second time recently that JPMorgan's research arm has drawn ire from the Indonesian government, and highlights the inevitable conflicts banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or company that their investment bankers are trying to court. In other cases, banks have altered research reports, lost lucrative contracts or parted ways with analysts following controversies about their negative opinions. JPMorgan did the right thing by not backing down from its report, said Roy C. Smith, a finance and management professor at New York University's business school. The bank stands to lose relatively little in Indonesia, where it does not have much financial exposure. "(It's) a mistake by Indonesia, which needs JPMorgan's support and advice more than the bank needs Indonesia," Smith said. "No effort by governments unhappy with research calls to 'discipline' the banks have been successful, though efforts are made from time to time to satisfy local political expectations." Global banks made changes to how they perform research in 2003, after a sweeping settlement with then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and U.S. regulators. They erected hard barriers between analysts and bankers and altered compensation structures to prevent conflicts of interest from affecting research. But the conflicts persist. Although pressure is usually less explicit than what JPMorgan faces in Indonesia, banks ranging from Morgan Stanley (MS.N) in China to Banco Santander (SAN.MC) in Brazil have faced similar rows with governments in emerging markets. In JPMorgan's case, analysts led by Adrian Mowat downgraded their investment recommendation on Indonesia stocks to "underweight" from "overweight" in a Nov. 13 note, and also downgraded Brazil equities to "neutral." They cited higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, predicting that higher volatility might stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets. The analysts characterized the recommendation as merely a "tactical" response to Trump's victory. They noted that economies in both Indonesia and Brazil are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017. Nazara, of Indonesia's finance ministry, said JPMorgan's analysis "did not make sense" because it gave Brazil a better rating than Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. "We have asked them to clarify their assessment," Nazara said. "They've explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies." "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. After performing what Nazara described as a "comprehensive review," Indonesia decided to drop JPMorgan as a primary dealer and a so-called perception bank. A 2006 government decree says perception banks are appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. "The impact on our clients is minimal, and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," she said by email. JPMorgan strategists have had a "neutral" recommendation on emerging market government bonds, including those of Indonesia, since before the election, a JPMorgan spokesman said. Robert Pakpahan, Indonesia's director general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters on Tuesday that JPMorgan's research should not have a major impact on Indonesia's future bond issuance, but the sanction on JPMorgan would remain in place "until we say otherwise." In 2015, Indonesia's then-finance minister said that JPMorgan had been "sanctioned" for a negative report recommending less exposure to government bonds, but did not explain what the sanctions involved. [reut.rs/2iF58uK] Banks have encountered a variety of problems managing conflicts in emerging markets. In another high-profile skirmish in 2006, Morgan Stanley's head economist in Asia, Andy Xie, left the bank after a critical email he sent about Singapore was leaked. In 2014, Banco Santander publicly fired an analyst who had published a critical note about Brazil's economic policies. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) lost a lucrative underwriting mandate for South Korea's Kookmin Bank [KOOKM.UL] in 2008 after one of its analysts issued a sell recommendation on the shares. More recently, Goldman has been embroiled in a scandal regarding the way it courted Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund, while JPMorgan has faced probes into its hiring children of Chinese officials to gain an edge in the country.

A 2006 government decree says a perception bank is one appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. Nazara said the penalty on JPMorgan has already taken effect. The decision was taken after JPMorgan issued a note in November downgrading its rating for Indonesian bonds to “underweight” from “overweight”, he said. The official said the bank’s analysis “did not make sense” because it recommended a “neutral” position for Brazil, a better rating than for Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. “We have asked them to clarify their assessment. They’ve explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It’s not that we think we’re so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries’ economies,” Nazara said. “Our mindset is, if you’re doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don’t create unnecessary volatility to create business,” he added. Business as usual A JPMorgan spokeswoman said today that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. “The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter,” she said in an email. In a note dated Nov. 13, JPMorgan downgraded emerging markets including Indonesia and Brazil, citing higher risk premiums for their credit default swaps after Donald Trump won the US presidential election. “Bond markets are starting to price in faster growth and higher deficit,” the bank wrote, adding that the “spike in volatility” may stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets in emerging markets. However, the bank said in the note that the downgrade on Indonesia and Brazil was a “tactical” response to Trump’s victory. Both economies are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017, it added. Indonesia’s 10-year credit default swap, a swap contract used to measure credit risk in fixed-income products, and the yield of its benchmark 10-year bonds spiked after the US election, though they have since dipped. Trump signalled more protective US trade policies, raising concerns about the impact on developing markets. Analysts have said that Indonesia’s economy should be supported by domestic consumption, which makes up more than half of gross domestic product. But the relatively high foreign ownership of government bonds and Indonesia’s lack of depth of financial markets make it vulnerable to capital reversals, they say. In 2015, then-Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said he had given JPMorgan a sanction that “will be disturbing for them and make them uncomfortable” after it recommended an “underweight” position on Indonesian bonds. He didn’t say what the sanction was. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Trump threatens BMW with border tax on cars built in Mexico World’s eight richest as wealthy as half of humanity, Oxfam tells Davos Job cuts, fewer flights?

The finance ministry ended the partnerships from Jan 1, saying the bank's November research report downgrading Indonesia to underweight was potentially destabilising to the nation's financial system, Okezone reported, citing a letter from Marwanto Harjowiryono, director general of treasury at the ministry. JPMorgan downgraded Indonesia by two notches to underweight from overweight in a Nov 13 report as a "tactical response" to the Trump election win. The bank also downgraded Brazil to neutral from overweight, while noting that both countries may provide a "better buying opportunity" later. JPMorgan's business in Indonesia continues to operate as normal, the bank said in an e-mailed statement on Tuesday (Jan 3). "The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," it said. Suahasil Nazara, head of fiscal agency at Indonesia's finance ministry, did not immediately respond to calls to his mobile phone on Tuesday. Foreign investors sold a net US$2.8 billion (S$4.05 billion) of Indonesian stocks and bonds last quarter as investors dumped emerging-market assets following Mr Trump's victory. That drove the rupiah lower, forcing policy makers to intervene to stabilise the currency.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Wall Street banks warn that President-elect Donald Trump might not turn the U.S. economy into the robust and thriving American powerhouse that has been promised – at least not right away. While Trump is promising to increase U.S. gross domestic profit to 5 percent to 6 percent from its current 2 percent level, Wall Street banks are forecasting that, at least in its first year, a Trump White House will fall short of its goal, the New York Post reported.   “JPMorgan Chase is predicting a 1.9 percent growth rate next year. Others are a bit more bullish: Wells Fargo predicts 2.1 percent growth and Goldman Sachs says it will grow at about 2.25 percent,” the Post reported. Goldman, Bank of America, UBS and Credit Suisse all predict the S&P 500 will end the year at about 2,300 — only 2.4 percent higher than its 2016 close and well below the 9.5 percent gain in 2016 and the 7 percent average gain. “This American economic expansion has been like a healthy tortoise, ambling slowly but steadily down the road,” wrote David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “There are signs the tortoise may pick up the pace in 2017.” Peter Morici, economist at the University of Maryland, tells Newsmax TV that although Trump is much smarter than Barack Obama, it will take some time to undo all of the regulatory damage the outgoing command-in-chief has imposed on America during the last eight years. "I have no doubt that Mr. Trump's a heck of a lot smarter than Barack Obama but Barack Obama had eight years to do this damage so it's going to take a lot of time to undo it," Morici told Bill Tucker on "The Steve Malzberg Show." "Executive orders can generally be reversed but not all,"  said Morici, who is also a Newsmax Finance Insider.  As for the U.S. economy itself, Morici predicts a slow grind. “This is not Ronald Reagan's economy. Cutting taxes is going to be difficult because we are much more constrained thanks to the recent years of slow growth," Morici told Miranda Khan on "Newsmax Prime." “2017 is going to be much like 2016. We're going to have slow economic growth because it's going to take time for the Republicans to put their program in place and it's going to take time to do things like unwind Obamacare. My feeling is the year where it hits the road where we find that if Donald Trump is successful is 2018. It's going to take most of next year to get us programmed in place. I'm optimistic that he can."   Related Stories: History Shows Fate Determines Economy More Than Presidential Policies Kudlow: Trump's 'Tax Holiday' Will 'Re-oxygenate the Economy' Joel Naroff: Happy Days Aren't Here Again as Economy Shows Autumn Weakness Economy's 3.5 Percent Growth Rate Isn't Expected to Last © 2017 Newsmax Finance.

While President-elect Donald Trump is promising to increase US gross domestic profit to 5 percent to 6 percent from its current 2 percent level, Wall Street banks are forecasting that, at least in its first year, a Trump White House will fall short of its goal. JPMorgan Chase is predicting a 1.9 percent growth rate next year. Others are a bit more bullish: Wells Fargo predicts 2.1 percent growth and Goldman Sachs says it will grow at about 2.25 percent. As for the S&P 500, Wall Street sees the popular index finishing 2017 up just slightly — well below the 9.5 percent gain in 2016 and the 7 percent average gain. Goldman, Bank of America, UBS and Credit Suisse all predict the S&P 500 will end the year at about 2,300 — only 2.4 percent higher than its 2016 close. JPMorgan is more bullish, forecasting a 7.2 percent rise in the index. FindTheCompany | Graphiq “This American economic expansion has been like a healthy tortoise, ambling slowly but steadily down the road,” wrote David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “There are signs the tortoise may pick up the pace in 2017.” As to the actions of the Federal Reserve, almost every major Wall Street bank predicts it will increase rates two or three times next year. “The market has moved toward our expectation that we’ll see three hikes from the Federal Reserve next year,” Jan Hatzius, Goldman’s chief economist, said in a video presentation. Banks have been notoriously wrong regarding predictions for the Fed’s plans, though — most banks forecast that Chair Janet Yellen would raise rates three or four times in 2016. In fact, she did so only once.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 4 January 2017 | MYT 6:45 AM Indonesia penalizes JPMorgan for negative report in latest emerging markets skirmish It is the second time recently that JPMorgan's research arm has drawn ire from the Indonesian government, and highlights the inevitable conflicts banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or company that their investment bankers are trying to court. JAKARTA/NEW YORK: Indonesia has cut some ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co after the bank's research analysts issued a negative report on the country, the latest in a series of skirmishes between Wall Street banks and governments in emerging markets. Indonesia will no longer use JPMorgan as a primary bond dealer and has also revoked a special designation that allows it to perform certain banking services, Suahasil Nazara, head of the Ministry of Finance's fiscal policy office, told Reuters on Tuesday. It is the second time recently that JPMorgan's research arm has drawn ire from the Indonesian government, and highlights the inevitable conflicts banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or company that their investment bankers are trying to court. In other cases, banks have altered research reports, lost lucrative contracts or parted ways with analysts following controversies about their negative opinions. JPMorgan did the right thing by not backing down from its report, said Roy C. Smith, a finance and management professor at New York University's business school. The bank stands to lose relatively little in Indonesia, where it does not have much financial exposure. "(It's) a mistake by Indonesia, which needs JPMorgan's support and advice more than the bank needs Indonesia," Smith said. "No effort by governments unhappy with research calls to 'discipline' the banks have been successful, though efforts are made from time to time to satisfy local political expectations." Global banks made changes to how they perform research in 2003, after a sweeping settlement with then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and U.S. regulators. They erected hard barriers between analysts and bankers and altered compensation structures to prevent conflicts of interest from affecting research. But the conflicts persist. Although pressure is usually less explicit than what JPMorgan faces in Indonesia, banks ranging from Morgan Stanley <MS.N> in China to Banco Santander <SAN.MC> in Brazil have faced similar rows with governments in emerging markets. In JPMorgan's case, analysts led by Adrian Mowat downgraded their investment recommendation on Indonesia stocks to "underweight" from "overweight" in a Nov. 13 note, and also downgraded Brazil equities to "neutral." They cited higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, predicting that higher volatility might stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets. The analysts characterized the recommendation as merely a "tactical" response to Trump's victory. They noted that economies in both Indonesia and Brazil are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017. Nazara, of Indonesia's finance ministry, said JPMorgan's analysis "did not make sense" because it gave Brazil a better rating than Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. "We have asked them to clarify their assessment," Nazara said. "They've explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies." "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. After performing what Nazara described as a "comprehensive review," Indonesia decided to drop JPMorgan as a primary dealer and a so-called perception bank. A 2006 government decree says perception banks are appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. "The impact on our clients is minimal, and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," she said by email. JPMorgan strategists have had a "neutral" recommendation on emerging market government bonds, including those of Indonesia, since before the election, a JPMorgan spokesman said. Robert Pakpahan, Indonesia's director general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters on Tuesday that JPMorgan's research should not have a major impact on Indonesia's future bond issuance, but the sanction on JPMorgan would remain in place "until we say otherwise." In 2015, Indonesia's then-finance minister said that JPMorgan had been "sanctioned" for a negative report recommending less exposure to government bonds, but did not explain what the sanctions involved. [http://reut.rs/2iF58uK] Banks have encountered a variety of problems managing conflicts in emerging markets. In another high-profile skirmish in 2006, Morgan Stanley's head economist in Asia, Andy Xie, left the bank after a critical email he sent about Singapore was leaked. In 2014, Banco Santander publicly fired an analyst who had published a critical note about Brazil's economic policies. Goldman Sachs Group Inc <GS.N> lost a lucrative underwriting mandate for South Korea's Kookmin Bank [KOOKM.UL] in 2008 after one of its analysts issued a sell recommendation on the shares. More recently, Goldman has been embroiled in a scandal regarding the way it courted Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund, while JPMorgan has faced probes into its hiring children of Chinese officials to gain an edge in the country.- Reuters Tags / Keywords: Banking , Banking , Economy , Economy , Stocks , Foreign News , Corporate News , Investing , Indonesia You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Kohli, Jadhav hundreds help India eclipse England's 350 Tourism industry ecstatic at Penang making it into CNN Travel list Do we really need to fear China money?

The finance ministry will stop using JPMorgan as a primary dealer and as an underwriter of its sovereign bonds, Robert Pakpahan, the ministry’s director-general for budget financing and risk management told reporters in Jakarta yesterday. He said a November research report issued by the bank was not “accurate or credible.” JPMorgan downgraded Indonesia by two notches to underweight from overweight in a Nov. 13 report as a “tactical response” to the Trump election win. The bank also downgraded Brazil, while noting that both countries may provide a “better buying opportunity” later. JPMorgan’s business in Indonesia continues to operate as normal, the bank said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. “The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter,” it said. Any tax payments by Indonesian companies which were previously routed through JPMorgan will now be passed to the government via other banks, according to Bank Indonesia Governor Agus Martowardojo. The government’s action illustrates some of the difficulties in producing balanced research reports, said Alan Richardson, an investment manager at Samsung Asset Management in Hong Kong. “I don’t think it will affect investor interest in Indonesia but it does reflect the difficulty of sell-side analysts to provide independent and objective opinions to their clients without upsetting the government officials and regulators,” Richardson said. Foreign investors sold a net USD2.8 billion of Indonesian stocks and bonds last quarter as investors dumped emerging market assets following Trump’s victory. That drove the rupiah lower, forcing policy makers to intervene to stabilize the currency. Banks should take responsibility for economic reports that “could influence fundamentals and psychology,” Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said yesterday, when asked to comment on the termination of the JPMorgan relationship. JPMorgan provides investment and commercial banking services to the public and private sectors in Indonesia, according to the bank’s website. It obtained an Indonesian banking license in 1968 in the name of Chase Manhattan, and opened a branch in Jakarta, followed by a representative office in 1978.

The Finance Ministry will stop using JPMorgan as a primary dealer and as an underwriter of its sovereign bonds, Mr Robert Pakpahan, the ministry's director-general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters yesterday. He said a November research report issued by the bank was not "accurate or credible". JPMorgan downgraded Indonesia's equity market by two notches to "underweight" from "overweight" in a Nov 13 report as a "tactical response" to the Trump election win. The bank also downgraded Brazil, while noting that both countries may provide a "better buying opportunity" later. JPMorgan's business in Indonesia continues to operate as normal, the bank said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. "The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," it said. Any tax payments by Indonesian companies which were previously routed through JPMorgan will now be passed to the government via other banks, according to Bank Indonesia governor Agus Martowardojo. The government's action illustrates some of the difficulties in producing balanced research reports, said Mr Alan Richardson, an investment manager at Samsung Asset Management in Hong Kong. "I don't think it will affect investor interest in Indonesia but it does reflect the difficulty of sell-side analysts to provide independent and objective opinions to their clients without upsetting the government officials and regulators," he said. Foreign investors sold a net US$2.8 billion (S$4 billion) of Indonesian stocks and bonds last quarter as investors dumped emerging-market assets following Mr Trump's victory. That drove the rupiah lower, forcing policymakers to intervene to stabilise the currency. Banks should take responsibility for economic reports that "could influence fundamentals and psychology", Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said yesterday, when asked to comment on the termination of the JPMorgan relationship. JPMorgan provides investment and commercial banking services to the public and private sectors in Indonesia, according to its website. It obtained an Indonesian banking licence in 1968 in the name of Chase Manhattan, and opened a branch in Jakarta.

JPMorgan Chase downgraded Indonesia's stock market by two notches in November, citing powerful market forces set off by Donald Trump's election victory. Indonesia didn't take too well to the demotion, even though the same research report also downgraded the stock markets of Brazil and Turkey. An Indonesia official told reporters in Jakarta on Tuesday that the country will ban JPMorgan from being hired as a primary dealer and an underwriter of its government debt, according to several news reports. Indonesia also indicated JPMorgan will no longer serve as a bank that receives tax payments to the government. The Southeast Asian nation explained the decision to punish JPMorgan by pointing directly to the November research report, which it criticized as not "accurate or credible." "The institutions with big names have very high responsibility in creating positive psychology instead of doing [something] misleading," said Sri Mulyani, Indonesia's finance minister, according to The Wall Street Journal. JPMorgan (JPM), which has substantial business interests in Indonesia, said it is working with the country's Ministry of Finance to "resolve the matter," and that its business there "continues to operate as usual." Related: Stocks storm into 2017 as Trump rally resumes JPMorgan's ties to Indonesia go back a long way. The bank opened its first branch in Indonesia under the Chase Manhattan brand in 1968. Since 2012, JPMorgan has served as an underwriter on nearly $14 billion worth of Indonesian government bond sales, including $3.4 billion last year, according to Dealogic. Indonesia's retaliation against JPMorgan appears to be aimed at stifling criticism, even from firms that have a duty to provide unbiased research to their clients. "It makes me uncomfortable when I see a government trying to influence independent analysts," said Win Thin, head of emerging market currency strategy at investment bank Brown Brothers Harriman. "It's pretty thin skinned for Indonesia to do that and a little silly. It shows you how sensitive policymakers can be," he said. The November 13 research report from JPMorgan lowered the bank's rating on Indonesia to "underweight" from "overweight." "There are losers from Trumponomics," the report warned. Related: Goldman Sachs accounts for 24% of Dow's Trump rally Ironically, JPMorgan's assessment of Indonesia's economy was actually quite positive, saying it is "improving," and that investors will "get a better buying opportunity." The analysts said the downgrade was caused by a combination of the Trump election and rising U.S. rates, which tend to hurt emerging markets. Like other emerging markets, Indonesia did take a hit after Trump's victory. The MSCI Indonesia index plunged as much as 12% after the U.S. election. However, Indonesian stocks have since rebounded and the stock market is now just 5% below its Election Day level. Overall, the Indonesian market rose 12% last year, outperforming emerging markets broadly. "I'm not sure why Indonesia is so nervous. It's actually held up pretty well," said Thin.

"It has not yet been perfect but we will continue improving it professionally, accountably, and transparently while continuing to develop mutually respectful relations," she said in connection with the governments decision to cut its partnership with JPMorgan Chase Bank. She said any partnership with financial institutions will be based on good and mutually beneficial relations, but building a positive climate is important under the current circumstances. "We do not close ourselves, we will be open to all criticism and assessments, which is important for improvement. However, institutions with a big reputation also have a big responsibility to create positive psychological conditions instead of misleading," the former World Bank director said. In view of that she hoped that all government partners will be able to complete each other in managing and preserving national economic fundamentals through continuous and positive cooperation. "We respect all products of research institutes in terms of their accuracy, credibility, methodology or assessment. We wish all stakeholders have the same message. Let us work positively," she said. Sri Mulyani assured that the government had listened to voices within the economic community as well as institutions that have high credibility and had made improvements from within, for example, with regard to tax reform. "If we think the national budget is the problem we correct it. We will not hesitate to do it because we believe professional, accountable, credible, and beneficial relations are important," she said. The Indonesian government has decided to cut its partnership with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in connection with the results of the US banks research, which is believed to have the potential to disrupt the stability of the countrys financial system. The director general of risks and financing management of the finance ministry, Robert Pakpahan, said the partnership with the bank was cut because it had doubted the quality of Indonesian companies assets. "The results of its research are questionable because it seems they are not based on accurate and credible assessment. Therefore, we decided to just cut it as we considered it unprofessional," he said. With the decision, JPMorgan Chase Bank will no longer be a selling agent for government bonds, a participant in bidding of government securities (SBSN) bidding, joint lead underwriter for global bonds, and a perception bank for state receipts. "There used to be 20 SUN (state bond) dealers. The number is now minus one and totally there are now 19. Total participants of SBSN (shariah bond) bid is 22, now there are 21 left. We have also revoked its position as a partner in joint lead underwriter. With regard to perception banks, we now have more than 50. So, it would be no problem," he said.(*) Latest News Difficult to restrict purchase of subsidized gas: Minister 21 hours ago Household consumption key to achieving economic growth in 2018 21 hours ago Freeport, Amman hope status change would not disturb firm operation 21 hours ago Ministry to expedite agriculture development in border areas 13th January 2017 Indonesia expects more investment from Japan 13th January 2017 Bank Indonesia forecasts current account deficit at 1.8% of GDP 13th January 2017 Indonesian Agriculture Minister chairs meeting on food resilience in S.E.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Wed, Jan 04, 2017 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Jakarta ends JPMorgan partnerships after downgrade Bloomberg Indonesia’s government said it terminated all business partnerships with JPMorgan Chase & Co after the US bank downgraded its assessment of Southeast Asia’s largest economy following US president-elect Donald Trump’s victory. The Indonesian Ministry of Finance will stop using JPMorgan as a primary dealer and as an underwriter of its sovereign bonds, Robert Pakpahan, the ministry’s director-general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters in Jakarta yesterday. He said a November research report issued by the bank was not “accurate or credible.” JPMorgan downgraded the Southeast Asian state by two notches to underweight from overweight in a Nov. 13 report as a “tactical response” to the Trump election win. The bank also downgraded Brazil, but said both countries might provide a “better buying opportunity” later. JPMorgan’s business in Indonesia continues to operate as normal, the bank said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. “The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter,” it said. Any tax payments by Indonesian companies that were previously routed through JPMorgan are now be passed to the government via other banks, Indonesia Governor Agus Martowardojo said. The government’s action illustrates some of the difficulties in producing balanced research reports, said Alan Richardson, an investment manager at Samsung Asset Management in Hong Kong. “I don’t think it will affect investor interest in Indonesia, but it does reflect the difficulty of sell-side analysts to provide independent and objective opinions to their clients without upsetting the government officials and regulators,” Richardson said. Foreign investors sold a net US$2.8 billion of Indonesian stocks and bonds last quarter, dumping emerging-market assets following Trump’s victory. That drove the rupiah lower, forcing policymakers to intervene to stabilize the currency. Banks should take responsibility for economic reports that “could influence fundamentals and psychology,” Indonesian Minister of Finance Sri Mulyani Indrawati said, when asked to comment on the JPMorgan termination. JPMorgan provides investment and commercial banking services to the public and private sectors in Indonesia, according to the bank’s Web site. It obtained an Indonesian banking license in 1968 in the name of Chase Manhattan, and opened a branch in Jakarta, followed by a representative office in 1978. This story has been viewed 1920 times.

Posted 03 Jan 2017 14:25 Updated 03 Jan 2017 23:30 A view of the exterior of the JP Morgan Chase & Co. corporate headquarters in New York City May 20, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files Enlarge Caption  Email More A A JAKARTA: Indonesia will drop JPMorgan Chase & Co from providing some services to the government after the bank's research arm said investors should reduce their exposure to the country, senior finance ministry officials said on Tuesday. "After we did a comprehensive review, we said no need to use JPMorgan's services as a primary (bond) dealer and a perception bank," Suahasil Nazara, the head of the ministry's fiscal policy office, told Reuters. A 2006 government decree says a perception bank is one appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. Nazara said the penalty on JPMorgan was already in effect. In an equities research note dated Nov. 13, JPMorgan downgraded its investment recommendation on Indonesia to "underweight" from "overweight", citing higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. "Bond markets are starting to price in faster growth and higher deficit," the bank wrote, adding that the "spike in volatility" may stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets in emerging markets. However, the bank said in the note that the downgrade on Indonesia and Brazil was a "tactical" response to Trump's victory. Both economies are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017, it added. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. "The impact on our clients is minimal, and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," she said by email. The finance ministry's Nazara said the bank's analysis "did not make sense" because it recommended a "neutral" position for Brazil, which is better than for Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. "We have asked them to clarify their assessment. They've explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies," Nazara said. "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. Robert Pakpahan, Indonesia's director general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters on Tuesday that JPMorgan's research should not have a major impact on Indonesia's future bond issuance, but the sanction on JPMorgan would remain in place "until we say otherwise". Primary dealers of Indonesian government bonds as of Nov. 25 included Citibank , Deutsche Bank AG , Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited and local lender PT Bank Central Asia Tbk , according to the finance ministry's website. (http://bit.ly/2iKae6n) Indonesia's 10-year credit default swap , a contract used to measure credit risk in fixed-income products, and the yield on its benchmark 10-year bonds spiked after the U.S. election, though they have since dipped. Trump signaled more protective U.S. trade policies, raising concerns about the impact on developing markets. Analysts have said Indonesia's economy should be supported by domestic consumption, which makes up more than half of gross domestic product. But the relatively high foreign ownership of government bonds and Indonesia's lack of depth of financial markets make it vulnerable to capital reversals, they say. Indonesia's central bank said shortly after the Federal Reserve raised U.S. interest rates in December that it was on guard against "reversals" of capital flows into the country. However, Fitch Ratings revised in December Indonesia's credit rating outlook to positive, citing a relatively low government debt burden, favorable growth outlook and an improving business environment.

(JPM), citing the U.S. lender's recent downgrade of equities in Southeast Asia's largest economy. The government said that the downgrade has the potential to disrupt the stability of the national financial system. The Indonesian government's finance ministry said it will stop using JP Morgan as a primary bond dealer and has also revoked its status as a "perception bank." A perception bank is a bank that is appointed by the Indonesian government to receive payments of taxes and other sources of income on behalf of the government. Indonesia's Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati called the report by JP Morgan as "misleading." "A nation's economy is affected by fundamental and psychological factors. The government is open to critics, but JP Morgan cuts its recommendation... without a credible assessment," the minister said. JP Morgan has multiple business partnerships with the government of Indonesia. The lender was a traditional underwriter for Indonesian government's bonds. Bank Indonesia Governor Agus Martowardojo reportedly said that tax payments by Indonesian companies that were earlier routed through JP Morgan will now be passed to the government through other banks. In a report dated November 13, JP Morgan's emerging markets equity strategists downgraded Indonesia's equity market by two notches to "underweight" from "overweight." The bank had also downgraded Brazil to "neutral" from "overweight." While JP Morgan did not elaborate its reasons for the downgrade, it said the move was a "tactical response" to Donald Trump's election win in the U.S. The company cited the spike in volatility of the bond market following Trump's win. "Post the U.S. elections 10-year bond yields moved from 1.85% to 2.15%. Bond markets are starting to price in faster growth and higher deficit. This spike in volatility increases EM risk premiums (i.e. Brazil, Indonesia CDS) and potentially stops/reverses flows into EM fixed income," JP Morgan said in the note. In contrast, Fitch Ratings said on December 21 that it has upgraded Indonesia's rating outook from "stable" to "positive," and affirmed its rating at BBB-. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Trump Takes Power, Manufacturing In Focus -- Economic Preview For Week of January 16 Lazy, or Inefficient?

(ANTARA/Yudhi Mahatma) Jakarta (ANTARA News) - Finance Minister Sri Mulyani said all forms of partnership with financial agencies should be formed based on good relations and mutual benefit. However, under the prevailing condition, it would be better if positive psychological form is created and the countrys economy would continue to be managed professionally amid the global condition that shows no signs of improvement. "It does not mean everything is perfect, but we will seek improvement with professionalism, accountability, and transparency and would continue to create relations with mutual respect," Sri Mulyani said here on Tuesday. She was commenting on the breaking of all ties between the government and JP Morgan Chase Bank. "We would be open to criticism and assessment, as it is important to improve ourselves. However, an agency having big name carries big responsibility to create positive psychology instead of misleading," she said apparently referring to the U.S. bank. She said she hope all governments partners could contribute to maintaining the national economic fundamental through positive and sustainable cooperation. She said the government has paid good attention to the people and views of agencies having high credibility such as in the issue of tax reform. "If we think the state budget as a sources of problem, we are not hesitate to make correction as we believe professional, accountable and credible relations are important," she said. Earlier the Finance Ministry terminated all business partnerships with JPMorgan Chase & Co. after a survey by the bank is considered potential to destabilize the countrys financial system. The government decided to stop using JPMorgan as a primary dealer and as an underwriter of its sovereign bonds. Robert Pakpahan, the ministrys director-general for budget financing and risk management told reporters here on Tuesday the research by JP Morgan cast doubt on the quality of the assets of Indonesian companies. Robert said the result of the research is "very much questionable based on not accurate and credible evaluation." He said JPMorgan will no longer serve as sales agent for government bonds and as joint lead underwriter for the government global bonds. Its position as perception bank for tax payments will be replaced by other bank, he added.

Dimon warned pre-Brexit vote that Leave could spell job moves (Source: Getty) Hayley Kirton The boss of one of banking's best known names has hinted he is concerned about the fate of London as financial hub following the Brexit vote. Even before the UK headed to the polls in June, JP Morgan's Jamie Dimon warned that a Leave vote could leave the lender with "no choice" but to reorganise its business model, including potentially moving jobs overseas. Now, Dimon has indicated he's feeling uncertain about what a post-Brexit London will look like. "We’re just not going to know until the negotiations take place," he said in an interview with Financial News, which was published today. "My goal is that whatever it is, I want to be able to serve clients the next day. So we just want to make sure we’re prepared to serve the client the next day." Read more: Farage: Brexit indecision puts the UK on the back foot Dimon added: "I wish we could keep it all here [in London]." JP Morgan's chief exec, who was at one point reported to be in the running for the top spot in President-elect Donald Trump's treasury team, has previously estimated the bank may need to move around 4,000 staff away from the UK to continue serving clients following its departure from the EU. When asked about job movements by Financial News, Dimon said: We’ve been planning for a range of outcomes because it’s still as uncertain as a couple months ago. What we know now is that this will be a slow process, and all the staff moves would not happen at once but over a period of years. If there is not a clear transitional period decided early in the process, where passporting rules still apply for a few years after negotiations, then we’d likely have to accelerate our timetable in complying with new rules. Read more: Prepare to refight the referendum: How Brexit will dominate 2017 politics In a separate interview with Bloomberg, Arnaud de Bresson, managing director of Parisian lobbying outfit Europlace, said the city could easily win over thousands of British bankers, and expected to see some moving in the near future. "We feel decisions will be taken in the first semester of the new year," de Bresson said. "We see institutions are accelerating their process of thinking." Benoit de Juvigny, the head of France's financial regulator, said last month that "large international banks" were already in the process of looking into their options for moving to the French capital. Meanwhile, a report from think tank TheCityUK, published last October, warned the UK could lose 75,000 jobs should the government plump for a so-called hard Brexit.

"After we did a comprehensive review, we said no need to use JPMorgan's services as a primary (bond) dealer and a perception bank," Suahasil Nazara, the head of the ministry's fiscal policy office, told Reuters. A 2006 government decree says a perception bank is one appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. Nazara said the penalty on JPMorgan (JPM.N) has already taken effect. The decision was taken after JPMorgan issued a note in November downgrading its rating for Indonesian bonds to "underweight" from "overweight", he said. The official said the bank's analysis "did not make sense" because it recommended a "neutral" position for Brazil, a better rating than for Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. "We have asked them to clarify their assessment. They've explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies," Nazara said. "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. BUSINESS AS USUAL A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. "The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," she said in an email. In a note dated Nov. 13, JPMorgan downgraded emerging markets including Indonesia and Brazil, citing higher risk premiums for their credit default swaps after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. "Bond markets are starting to price in faster growth and higher deficit," the bank wrote, adding that the "spike in volatility" may stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets in emerging markets. However, the bank said in the note that the downgrade on Indonesia and Brazil was a "tactical" response to Trump's victory. Both economies are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017, it added. Indonesia's 10-year credit default swap (IDGV10YUSAC=MG), a swap contract used to measure credit risk in fixed-income products, and the yield of its benchmark 10-year bonds (ID10YT=RR) spiked after the U.S. election, though they have since dipped. Trump signaled more protective U.S. trade policies, raising concerns about the impact on developing markets. Analysts have said that Indonesia's economy should be supported by domestic consumption, which makes up more than half of gross domestic product. But the relatively high foreign ownership of government bonds and Indonesia's lack of depth of financial markets make it vulnerable to capital reversals, they say. In 2015, then-Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said he had given JPMorgan a sanction that "will be disturbing for them and make them uncomfortable" after it recommended an "underweight" position on Indonesian bonds. He didn't say what the sanction was.

The finance ministry will stop using JPMorgan as a primary dealer and as an underwriter of its sovereign bonds, Robert Pakpahan, the ministry’s director-general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters in Jakarta on Tuesday. He said a November research report issued by the bank was not “accurate or credible”. JPMorgan downgraded Indonesia by two notches to underweight from overweight in a November 13 report as a “tactical response” to the Trump election win. The bank also downgraded Brazil, while noting that both countries may provide a “better buying opportunity” later. JPMorgan’s business in Indonesia continues to operate as normal, the bank said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. “The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter,” it said. Tax payments Any tax payments by Indonesian companies which were previously routed through JPMorgan will now be passed to the government via other banks, according to Bank Indonesia Governor Agus Martowardojo. The government’s action illustrates some of the difficulties in producing balanced research reports, said Alan Richardson, an investment manager at Samsung Asset Management in Hong Kong. “I don’t think it will affect investor interest in Indonesia but it does reflect the difficulty of sell-side analysts to provide independent and objective opinions to their clients without upsetting the government officials and regulators,” Richardson said. Foreign investors sold a net $2.8 billion of Indonesian stocks and bonds last quarter as investors dumped emerging-market assets following Trump’s victory. That drove the rupiah lower, forcing policymakers to intervene to stabilise the currency. Banks should take responsibility for economic reports that “could influence fundamentals and psychology”, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said on Tuesday, when asked to comment on the termination of the JPMorgan relationship. JPMorgan provides investment and commercial banking services to the public and private sectors in Indonesia, according to the bank’s website. It obtained an Indonesian banking licence in 1968 in the name of Chase Manhattan, and opened a branch in Jakarta, followed by a representative office in 1978.

Photo: Shutterstock Indonesia has penalised JPMorgan Chase & Co after the investment bank's research arm recommended a smaller exposure to the country's sovereign bonds, a senior finance ministry official said on Tuesday. "After we did a comprehensive review, we said no need to use JPMorgan's services as a primary (bond) dealer and a perception bank," Suahasil Nazara, the head of the ministry's fiscal policy office, told Reuters. A 2006 government decree says a perception bank is one appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. Nazara said the penalty on JPMorgan has already taken effect. The decision was taken after JPMorgan issued a note in November downgrading its rating for Indonesian bonds to "underweight" from "overweight", he said. The official said the bank's analysis "did not make sense" because it recommended a "neutral" position for Brazil, a better rating than for Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the South-east Asian nation. "We have asked them to clarify their assessment. They've explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies," Nazara said. "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. BUSINESS AS USUAL A JPMorgan spokeswoman said that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. "The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," she said in an email. In a note dated November 13, JPMorgan downgraded emerging markets including Indonesia and Brazil, citing higher risk premiums for their credit default swaps after Donald Trump won the US presidential election. "Bond markets are starting to price in faster growth and higher deficit," the bank wrote, adding that the "spike in volatility" may stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets in emerging markets. However, the bank said in the note that the downgrade on Indonesia and Brazil was a "tactical" response to Trump's victory. Both economies are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017, it added. Indonesia's 10-year credit default swap, a swap contract used to measure credit risk in fixed-income products, and the yield of its benchmark 10-year bonds spiked after the US election, though they have since dipped. Trump signalled more protective US trade policies, raising concerns about the impact on developing markets. Analysts have said that Indonesia's economy should be supported by domestic consumption, which makes up more than half of gross domestic product. But the relatively high foreign ownership of government bonds and Indonesia's lack of depth of financial markets make it vulnerable to capital reversals, they say. In 2015, then-Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said he had given JPMorgan a sanction that "will be disturbing for them and make them uncomfortable" after it recommended an "underweight" position on Indonesian bonds. He didn't say what the sanction was. « ‘Equestrian princess’ leads Samsung at centre of scandal Asset Class performances in 2016 » Advert See our Comments Policy Comments are submitted under the express understanding and condition that the editor may, and is authorised to, disclose any/all of the above personal information to any person or entity requesting the information for the purposes of legal action on grounds that such person or entity is aggrieved by any comment so submitted.

Robert Pakpahan, Indonesia's director general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters on Tuesday that JPMorgan's research should not have a major impact on Indonesia's future bond issuance, but the sanction on JPMorgan would remain in place "until we say otherwise". Primary dealers of Indonesian government bonds as of Nov. 25 included Citibank , Deutsche Bank AG , Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited and local lender PT Bank Central Asia Tbk , according to the finance ministry's website. (http://bit.ly/2iKae6n) Indonesia's 10-year credit default swap , a contract used to measure credit risk in fixed-income products, and the yield on its benchmark 10-year bonds spiked after the U.S. election, though they have since dipped.

Indonesia's central bank said shortly after the Federal Reserve raised U.S. interest rates in December that it was on guard against "reversals" of capital flows into the country. However, Fitch Ratings revised in December Indonesia's credit rating outlook to positive, citing a relatively low government debt burden, favorable growth outlook and an improving business environment.

 The 2 big investing tips for 2017 from a JPMorgan strategy chief Lianna Brinded Jan. 3, 2017, 4:27 AM 12,737 facebook linkedin twitter email print Paramount Pictures The chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management has given clients two key tips on how to invest in 2017 — and they are pretty simple. In a brief client note, David Kelly provided two "brief financial resolutions" he said investors should consider this year: 1. Avoid home country bias — Kelly says that there is "the tendency of investors around the world to be over-invested in securities of their own country." 2. Don't focus on past performance — Kelly says investors should not stuff their portfolios with assets that have previously had a stellar run but instead should look at "current valuations and future prospects." "These valuations and prospects suggest more reasons for caution around U.S. stocks and optimism around international stocks than investors have demonstrated over the last few years and particularly over the last few weeks," he said. The FTSE 100, Britain's benchmark share index, hit a fresh closing high on the final trading day of 2016, marking the third time in three days in which the index had broken all-time highs. Google Finance In the US, the S&P 500 was up over 10% across the year: Markets Insider "Investors reflecting upon a politically tumultuous 2016 should actually be fairly pleased by the returns that global asset markets have delivered," Kelly said. "Global equities rose around 10% (with small caps far exceeding that) and global bonds eked out a modest return." Here is the chart from JPMAM: JPMAM Stocks in particular have performed strongly over the past year despite political upheaval from the Brexit vote, the election of a new US president, and a flurry of new elections happening across Europe. Kelly said commodities had been a key driver for the markets despite the shift in the political landscape. "A bounce in commodity prices has been a key driver for markets, helping emerging market equities and allowing credit markets to recover from the distressed levels seen a year ago," Kelly said. "The resilience of economic growth has also been important, pushing unemployment rates in most major countries below the levels at which they started 2016.

Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Funds News | Tue Jan 3, 2017 | 3:40am EST RPT-Britain avoids M&A collapse as foreign buyers go Brexit bargain hunting (Repeats story published on Dec. 30 with no changes to text) * UK M&A value down from 2015 but in trend * Foreign buyers snap up UK companies with dollars * Goldman, JPMorgan, Lazard top UK dealmaking league * SoftBank-ARM, Twenty-First Century Fox-Sky top two deals By Pamela Barbaglia and Guy Faulconbridge LONDON, Dec 30 Britain avoided a collapse in mergers and acquisitions activity after the shock Brexit vote as foreign companies used sterling's spectacular devaluation against the U.S. dollar to snap up British companies, Thomson Reuters data shows. British M&A totalled $177.5 billion in 2016, down sharply from the record $394.8 billion reached in 2015 - a year when the UK data was skewed by two of three biggest global deals - but was in line with the longer 5-year trend. Total annual mergers and acquisitions values averaged $139.3 billion for the five years to the start of 2015. Britain also retained its place as the third largest M&A market after the United States and China. Behind the headline numbers, there was another clear trend: foreign buyers - such as Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox - shopping with dollars for bargains while domestic UK-to-UK dealmaking fell off sharply. "Brexit should never have been talked up as an Armageddon moment for UK M&A, especially with such a sharp devaluation in the currency which has clearly been a stimulus for overseas buyers," Tim Gee, London-based M&A partner at law firm Baker & McKenzie, told Reuters. "Much of the activity in 2016 was skewed towards foreign buyers with less UK-to-UK activity," Gee said. "Total activity levels were not really knocked that much by Brexit but who was doing the buying did shift - deal values in 2016 are very similar to the historical trend." Inbound M&A was $143.7 billion, again down from 2015 but way above the $85.9 billion annual average for the 5 years to 2015, while domestic M&A was $33.7 billion, down from an average of $53.4 billion over the same period. There were just 1,355 domestic deals - the lowest figure in nearly two decades of Thomson Reuters data. 2015 was a record year for dealmaking involving UK-listed companies thanks to a series of jumbo deals including Anheuser-Busch Inbev's $110.3 billion acquisition of SABMiller and Shell's $53 billion merger with BG Group. BREXIT 'ARMAGEDDON'? The June 23 vote took many investors and chief executives by surprise, triggering the deepest political and financial turmoil in Britain since World War Two and the biggest ever one-day fall in sterling against the dollar. On the day of the vote, sterling traded above $1.50 but is now trading below $1.23 and fell below $1.15 at one point in October. While opponents of leaving the EU had warned that the United Kingdom's economy would stall and investment stop if voters opted to exit, the data since the Brexit vote has shown the economy was resilient. Just a week after Theresa May entered Downing Street to replace David Cameron as British prime minister, Softbank founder Masayoshi Son made a $30.7 billion move for UK-based chip designer ARM Holdings. "I am one of the first people to bet with a big size on the UK after Brexit," Son, who is ranked by Forbes as Japan's second richest man with a $14.9 fortune, told reporters in London at the time. "Talking is easy. I am proving it...This is my big bet." The second biggest deal of the year was struck by Murdoch: a $14.6 billion deal to buy European pay-TV firm Sky. People familiar with the matter told Reuters the American media corporation pounced after the Brexit vote sent the pound down against the U.S. dollar and Sky's share price tumbling. "The worst predictions surrounding Brexit and its potential impact on our economy have so far failed to materialize," Derek Shakespeare, co-head of UK M&A at Barclays, told Reuters. "With the weaker pound UK businesses have become 10 to 20 percent cheaper." "But the devil is in the detail: we have several years ahead of us to understand what the trading relationship with the EU will look like. So there's a degree of caution when looking at transactions in Britain," he said. "BREXIT MEANS BREXIT" Goldman Sachs, the world's top dealmaker, was top again in Britain's league tables, followed by JPMorgan and Lazard which rose to third place in Britain above Deutsche Bank, UBS, Centerview Partners LLC and Morgan Stanley , Thomson Reuters data showed. "Geopolitical events such as Brexit have impacted CEO confidence for deal-making over the first part of the year and through the summer," said Gilberto Pozzi, co-head of global M&A at Goldman Sachs.

British M&A totalled $177.5 billion in 2016, down sharply from the record $394.8 billion reached in 2015 - a year when the UK data was skewed by two of three biggest global deals - but was in line with the longer 5-year trend. Total annual mergers and acquisitions values averaged $139.3 billion for the five years to the start of 2015. Britain also retained its place as the third largest M&A market after the United States and China. Behind the headline numbers, there was another clear trend: foreign buyers - such as Rupert Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox - shopping with dollars for bargains while domestic UK-to-UK dealmaking fell off sharply. "Brexit should never have been talked up as an Armageddon moment for UK M&A, especially with such a sharp devaluation in the currency which has clearly been a stimulus for overseas buyers," Tim Gee, London-based M&A partner at law firm Baker & McKenzie, told Reuters. "Much of the activity in 2016 was skewed towards foreign buyers with less UK-to-UK activity," Gee said. "Total activity levels were not really knocked that much by Brexit but who was doing the buying did shift - deal values in 2016 are very similar to the historical trend." Inbound M&A was $143.7 billion, again down from 2015 but way above the $85.9 billion annual average for the 5 years to 2015, while domestic M&A was $33.7 billion, down from an average of $53.4 billion over the same period. There were just 1,355 domestic deals - the lowest figure in nearly two decades of Thomson Reuters data. 2015 was a record year for dealmaking involving UK-listed companies thanks to a series of jumbo deals including Anheuser-Busch Inbev's $110.3 billion acquisition of SABMiller and Shell's $53 billion merger with BG Group. BREXIT 'ARMAGEDDON'? The June 23 vote took many investors and chief executives by surprise, triggering the deepest political and financial turmoil in Britain since World War Two and the biggest ever one-day fall in sterling against the dollar. On the day of the vote, sterling traded above $1.50 but is now trading below $1.23 and fell below $1.15 at one point in October. While opponents of leaving the EU had warned that the United Kingdom's economy would stall and investment stop if voters opted to exit, the data since the Brexit vote has shown the economy was resilient. Just a week after Theresa May entered Downing Street to replace David Cameron as British prime minister, Softbank founder Masayoshi Son made a $30.7 billion move for UK-based chip designer ARM Holdings. "I am one of the first people to bet with a big size on the UK after Brexit," Son, who is ranked by Forbes as Japan's second richest man with a $14.9 fortune, told reporters in London at the time. "Talking is easy. I am proving it...This is my big bet." The second biggest deal of the year was struck by Murdoch: a $14.6 billion deal to buy European pay-TV firm Sky. People familiar with the matter told Reuters the American media corporation pounced after the Brexit vote sent the pound down against the U.S. dollar and Sky's share price tumbling. "The worst predictions surrounding Brexit and its potential impact on our economy have so far failed to materialize," Derek Shakespeare, co-head of UK M&A at Barclays, told Reuters. "With the weaker pound UK businesses have become 10 to 20 percent cheaper." "But the devil is in the detail: we have several years ahead of us to understand what the trading relationship with the EU will look like. So there's a degree of caution when looking at transactions in Britain," he said. "BREXIT MEANS BREXIT" Goldman Sachs, the world's top dealmaker, was top again in Britain's league tables, followed by JPMorgan and Lazard which rose to third place in Britain above Deutsche Bank, UBS, Centerview Partners LLC and Morgan Stanley , Thomson Reuters data showed. "Geopolitical events such as Brexit have impacted CEO confidence for deal-making over the first part of the year and through the summer," said Gilberto Pozzi, co-head of global M&A at Goldman Sachs. "We are now seeing a rebound in M&A activity although boards remain quite cautious in reviewing the opportunities and the pros and cons of M&A transactions," Pozzi said. Barclays' Shakespeare said many private equity funds have recently sold assets and cashed out of high multiples thus boosting their ability to raise funds. So what will happen in 2017? Baker & McKenzie's Gee said he expected low levels of activity among financial institutions and basic materials, resources and commodities while M&A hot spots would include technology, innovation and healthcare.

"After we did a comprehensive review, we said no need to use JPMorgan's services as a primary (bond) dealer and a perception bank," Suahasil Nazara, the head of the ministry's fiscal policy office, told Reuters. A 2006 government decree says a perception bank is one appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. Nazara said the penalty on JPMorgan has already taken effect. The decision was taken after JPMorgan issued a note in November downgrading its rating for Indonesian bonds to "underweight" from "overweight," he said. The official said the bank's analysis "did not make sense" because it recommended a "neutral" position for Brazil, a better rating than for Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation.

It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies," Nazara said. "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. Business as usual A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. "The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," she said in an email. In a note dated Nov. 13, JPMorgan downgraded emerging markets, including Indonesia and Brazil, citing higher risk premiums for their credit default swaps after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. "Bond markets are starting to price in faster growth and higher deficit," the bank wrote, adding that the "spike in volatility" may stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets in emerging markets. However, the bank said in the note that the downgrade on Indonesia and Brazil was a "tactical" response to Trump's victory. Both economies are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017, it added. Indonesia's 10-year credit default swap, a swap contract used to measure credit risk in fixed-income products, and the yield of its benchmark 10-year bonds spiked after the U.S. election, though they have since dipped. Trump signaled more protective U.S. trade policies, raising concerns about the impact on developing markets. Analysts have said that Indonesia's economy should be supported by domestic consumption, which makes up more than half of gross domestic product. But the relatively high foreign ownership of government bonds and Indonesia's lack of depth of financial markets make it vulnerable to capital reversals, they say. In 2015, then-Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said he had given JPMorgan a sanction that "will be disturbing for them and make them uncomfortable" after it recommended an "underweight" position on Indonesian bonds. He didn't say what the sanction was. Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook. Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change Indonesia 10-Year --- JPM ---

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 2:30 PM, January 3, 2017 Updated: 5:30 AM, January 4, 2017 JAKARTA/NEW YORK - Indonesia has cut some ties with JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> after the bank's research analysts issued a negative report on the country, the latest in a series of skirmishes between Wall Street banks and governments in emerging markets. Indonesia will no longer use JPMorgan as a primary bond dealer and has also revoked a special designation that allows it to perform certain banking services, Suahasil Nazara, head of the Ministry of Finance's fiscal policy office, told Reuters on Tuesday. It is the second time recently that JPMorgan's research arm has drawn ire from the Indonesian government, and highlights the inevitable conflicts banks face when their analysts express a negative view on a country or company that their investment bankers are trying to court. In other cases, banks have altered research reports, lost lucrative contracts or parted ways with analysts following controversies about their negative opinions. JPMorgan did the right thing by not backing down from its report, said Roy C. Smith, a finance and management professor at New York University's business school. The bank stands to lose relatively little in Indonesia, where it does not have much financial exposure. "(It's) a mistake by Indonesia, which needs JPMorgan's support and advice more than the bank needs Indonesia," Smith said. "No effort by governments unhappy with research calls to 'discipline' the banks have been successful, though efforts are made from time to time to satisfy local political expectations." Global banks made changes to how they perform research in 2003, after a sweeping settlement with then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and U.S. regulators. They erected hard barriers between analysts and bankers and altered compensation structures to prevent conflicts of interest from affecting research. But the conflicts persist. Although pressure is usually less explicit than what JPMorgan faces in Indonesia, banks ranging from Morgan Stanley <MS.N> in China to Banco Santander <SAN.MC> in Brazil have faced similar rows with governments in emerging markets. In JPMorgan's case, analysts led by Adrian Mowat downgraded their investment recommendation on Indonesia stocks to "underweight" from "overweight" in a Nov. 13 note, and also downgraded Brazil equities to "neutral." They cited higher risk premiums for emerging markets after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election, predicting that higher volatility might stop or reverse flows into fixed-income assets. The analysts characterized the recommendation as merely a "tactical" response to Trump's victory. They noted that economies in both Indonesia and Brazil are improving, with lower policy rates likely to support valuations for 2017. Nazara, of Indonesia's finance ministry, said JPMorgan's analysis "did not make sense" because it gave Brazil a better rating than Indonesia, despite what he said was a more stable political situation in the Southeast Asian nation. "We have asked them to clarify their assessment," Nazara said. "They've explained to us, but we found their argument not credible. It's not that we think we're so great, but we look at ourselves and we look at other countries' economies." "Our mindset is, if you're doing business here in Indonesia, the spirit is to maintain stability. Don't create unnecessary volatility to create business," he added. After performing what Nazara described as a "comprehensive review," Indonesia decided to drop JPMorgan as a primary dealer and a so-called perception bank. A 2006 government decree says perception banks are appointed by the finance minister to receive transfers of state revenue not related to imports, including tax, onshore excise and non-tax revenue. A JPMorgan spokeswoman said on Tuesday that it continued to operate its business in Indonesia as usual. "The impact on our clients is minimal, and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter," she said by email. JPMorgan strategists have had a "neutral" recommendation on emerging market government bonds, including those of Indonesia, since before the election, a JPMorgan spokesman said. Robert Pakpahan, Indonesia's director general for budget financing and risk management, told reporters on Tuesday that JPMorgan's research should not have a major impact on Indonesia's future bond issuance, but the sanction on JPMorgan would remain in place "until we say otherwise." In 2015, Indonesia's then-finance minister said that JPMorgan had been "sanctioned" for a negative report recommending less exposure to government bonds, but did not explain what the sanctions involved. [http://reut.rs/2iF58uK] Banks have encountered a variety of problems managing conflicts in emerging markets. In another high-profile skirmish in 2006, Morgan Stanley's head economist in Asia, Andy Xie, left the bank after a critical email he sent about Singapore was leaked.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 3 January 2017 | MYT 1:51 PM Indonesia ends JPMorgan partnerships on downgrade JAKARTA: Indonesia terminated all business partnerships with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. after the U.S. bank downgraded its assessment of Southeast Asia’s largest economy following Donald Trump’s surprise U.S. election win, according to a report on the Okezone news portal. The finance ministry ended the partnerships from Jan. 1, saying the bank’s November research report downgrading Indonesia to underweight was potentially destabilizing to the nation’s financial system, Okezone reported, citing a letter from Marwanto Harjowiryono, the director general of treasury at the ministry. JPMorgan double-downgraded Indonesia to underweight from overweight in a Nov. 13 report as a “tactical response” to the Trump election win. The bank also downgraded Brazil to neutral from overweight, while noting that both countries may provide a “better buying opportunity” later. JPMorgan’s business in Indonesia continues to operate as normal, the bank said in an e-mailed statement on Tuesday. “The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter,” it said. Suahasil Nazara, the head of fiscal agency at Indonesia’s finance ministry, didn’t immediately respond to calls to his mobile phone on Tuesday. Foreign investors sold a net $2.8 billion of Indonesian stocks and bonds last quarter as investors dumped emerging-market assets following Trump’s victory. That drove the rupiah lower, forcing policy makers to intervene to stabilize the currency. - Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Corporate News , Indonesia , Economy You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read Weekend Do Lovely gifts for readers Do we really need to fear China money?

(Reuters Photo/Andrew Burton) By : Tabita Diela | on 8:28 PM January 02, 2017 Category : Business, Corporate News, Featured [Updated at 10:44 p.m on Monday, Jan 2, 2016 to add an official's comment on JP Morgan's dealing in Indonesia government bonds in sixth paragraph] Jakarta. The finance ministry has cut all partnerships with JP Morgan Chase after emerging markets equity strategists at the multinational banking and financial services company recommended investors to reduce their portfolio investment exposure in the biggest economy in southeast Asia. In a statement dated Dec. 9 and signed by Marwanto Harjowiryono, the director general of treasury at the Ministry of Finance, the ministry said the JP Morgan report can do damage to Indonesia's financial stability. In response, the ministry has revoked JP Morgan's "perception bank" status starting Sunday (01/01) and terminated all its cooperation with the ministry. The perception bank status is awarded to a bank that has been appointed by the finance minister to be a partner of the ministry, providing various banking services including receiving taxation, excise fees and other non-tax revenues. The New York-based investment banking company has also been a traditional underwriter for Indonesia's government bond sales. "In case of non existence of partnership, becoming [bonds main dealer or underwriter] is not possible," Loto Srinaita Ginting, the director for government debt securities at the Finance Ministry's directorate general of budget financing and risk management, told the Jakarta Globe. JP Morgan in November released a report that double downgraded the country to underweight from overweight, after reading a trend that the benchmark US 10-year treasuries offered more attractive yields, which in turn increased risks of fixed-income investment into emerging market countries like Indonesia. The investment banking company also cut Brazil from overweight to neutral and highlighted Turkey as another emerging market that is highly sensitive to such issue. This was the second time in just over a year that Indonesia's finance ministry was infuriated by a JP Morgan assessment. In August 2015, then finance minister Bambang Brodjonegoro issued a strong warning to the investment bank after it published a report that exacerbated panic in the local financial market amid steep US dollar appreciation and currency war concerns in the wake of China's yuan devaluation.  Show More Indonesia finance ministry JP Morgan Chase Indonesia investment outlook Indonesia Tries to Assure Banks They Won't Be Penalized If Research Is "Credible" Finance Ministry Regulation Following Tax Amnesty Program   Comments Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Cramer said investors simply asked too much of stocks when they have already skyrocketed to new highs. Many will need to take a breather after running higher in 2016. "After year's remarkable run, many of the market's leaders have already given us all they've got," the "Mad Money" host said. The five top performers of the Dow in 2016 were Goldman Sachs, UnitedHealth, JPMorgan, Chevron and Caterpillar. Caterpillar was up 36 percent last year. The company managed to gain control over its destiny through innovation, supply chain management and reining in its dealer network. However, Cramer fears that a strengthening dollar and China's growth could hurt Caterpillar. Timothy A. Clark | AFP | Getty Images JP Morgan Chase World Headquarters on Park Avenue in New York. "I think JPM's the biggest winner of the five, and it's the one I would bet on if you believe that the Trump rally is far from finished." -Jim Cramer "If you buy CAT here, you have to believe that numbers come up, not down, and as much as I have championed the stock, I think it has given you all it has to give, at least for now, unless Trump issues $500 billion in 50-year Make America Great Again bonds where the money is earmarked to purchase only U.S. made products," Cramer said. The second best performer was UnitedHealth, up 35 percent last year. While Cigna and Anthem, and Humana and Aetna were busy trying to merge, UnitedHealth stood out to Cramer as the one company to challenge the Affordable Care Act when it spoke publicly against the healthcare exchanges. Hence, Cramer expects President-elect Trump to call on UnitedHealth to help redo healthcare, which could be a great business opportunity. "UnitedHealth is the most likely to become a two-year dynasty," Cramer said. The third was Goldman Sachs, which rallied 32 percent, and Cramer thinks the stock could roar higher in 2017. He suspects that "Goldman can go back to being Goldman." Meaning, a company that makes money with its own money and gets a premium for being clever. And with the Republicans in full control of Congress, Cramer expects that criticism from anti-Wall Street Senators like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren won't have as much impact on the stock. Fourth was Chevron, which soared 30 percent last year. The company is viewed as the most aggressive of the major oil companies since it cut back on spending and maintained its dividend, and became the new blue chip of the group. "All I can tell you is that Chevron is the one trading in lockstep with oil, but I suspect that oil is stick here for a bit … So I wouldn't bet on a huge run beyond the stock's current recovery," Cramer said. The last winner on Cramer's list was JPMorgan, and it was also up 30 percent. This was Cramer's No. 1 stock for 2017, as it could benefit big time if the Fed raises interest rates multiple times in 2017. It could also be a beneficiary of deregulation. Even better, if the U.S. economy grows the way Trump promised, it will be one of the few stocks that can make profits without pressure on earnings from a strong dollar. "Suffice it to say, I think JPM's the biggest winner of the five, and it's the one I would bet on if you believe that the Trump rally is far from finished," Cramer said. Ultimately, Cramer was willing to bless Goldman Sachs, UnitedHealth and JPMorgan as stocks that have more room to run, while Chevron and Caterpillar may need to pause. Questions for Cramer?

Xerox and Conduent split, begin trading separately By ANDREA DECKERT Rochester Business Journal January 3, 2017 Xerox Corp.’s decision to split into two public companies was the top local business story of 2016, Rochester Business Journal readers and staff agreed. Xerox Corp. on Tuesday reported the completion its separation of Conduent Inc., creating two publicly traded companies. The news, along with stock upgrades, resulted in a nearly 16 percent increase in Xerox’s stock price. Shares of Xerox (NYSE: XRX) were trading midday at $6.65, up from Friday’s close of $5.75, adjusted post-split. In Monroe County, Xerox employs some 5,500 workers; Conduent has slightly more than 600 local employees. Credit Suisse Group AG Tuesday upgraded Xerox stock to outperform from neutral; JP Morgan Chase & Co. upgraded the business to overweight from neutral. “Today is an historic day for Xerox,” CEO Jeff Jacobson said in a statement. “The successful completion of the separation sharpens our market focus and commitment to our customers.” Under the terms of the separation, on the distribution date of Dec. 31, Xerox shareholders received one share of Conduent common stock for every five shares of Xerox common stock they held as of the close of business on Dec. 15. In connection with the spinoff, Xerox received a cash transfer from Conduent of $1.8 billion, which it intends to use, along with cash on hand, to retire approximately $2 billion in debt, Xerox said. Members of the company’s executive leadership team, employees and customers are to ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Conduent shares (NYSE: CNDT) were down roughly 6 percent at $14.01 in early afternoon trading. CEO Ashok Vemuri rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

Wall Street's consensus S&P 500 forecast calls for a little more than a 5 percent gain in 2017, the smallest increase predicted since a 2.8 percent forecast heading into 2005, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Source: Bespoke Investment Group (Note: The Bespoke table is from before the final trading day of the year. Adjusting for the S&P 500's actual 2016 close of 2,238.83, the consensus forecast equals a 5.5 rise.) The bearishness has many investors feeling good about the prospects for the new year. History bears that contrarian viewpoint out as the strategists' consensus forecast turned out to be too bearish for 6 of the last 8 annual periods during this bull market, according to the chart above. Here are the 2017 forecasts by firm: Source: Bespoke Investment Group JPMorgan's Dubravko Lakos-Bujas is near the middle predicting the S&P 500 will rise to just 2,400 by the end of the year. In his outlook note last month, the strategist captured the opposing forces causing Wall Street sages to be more cautious than the trading crowd: "The prospects of pro-growth policy reforms under the Trump administration (i.e., deregulation, tax reform, fiscal spending) should continue to push the market higher. ... However, rising yields and USD are the main risks to our positive equity outlook. This week's incrementally hawkish tone from the FOMC meeting is raising the hurdle for both expanding equity multiple and corporate profitability. ... Historically, a 6% rise in trade-weighted USD pressures S&P 500 EPS by roughly 2-3%." Bull markets tend to end with this group overly bullish, not bearish. For example, they expected an 11.1 percent increase in the S&P 500 in 2008, a year when a bull market ended with a plunge in the index of almost 40 percent because of the housing crisis, according to Bespoke. For the bullsish strategists, this year is a simple one to forecast. They argue that Trump's tax cuts and economic policies are going to lead to higher earnings and stock prices follow profits. Here's what RBC's Jonathan Golub, the only strategist calling for a 10 percent or greater S&P 500 gain this year, wrote in a note last month. "Following two years of near-zero growth, we expect profits to re-accelerate ... 2018 EPS growth (+9.4%) assumes a 2–3% impact from Trump policies. This placeholder for changes in taxes, regulation, and spending is quite modest, in our view, as an adjustment to corporate taxes alone could easily double this impact. ... We believe multiples will advance more quickly than earnings over the near term, as analysts wait for clarity on Trump policies before adjusting estimates." In a rare spot for the firm, Goldman Sachs is tied for being the most bearish on Wall Street. Goldman's David Kostin said in a note this weekend he doesn't believe Trump can deliver all that he has promised, even with a Republican-led Congress: "S&P 500 will rally to 2400 in 1Q 2017 alongside enthusiasm over corporate tax cuts, but budget constraints will limit the magnitude of tax reform and fiscal spending and the index will fade to 2300 by year-end." Bespoke doesn't just number crunch, it uses those historical figures to give a market outlook to clients as well. The firm is on the cautious side for 2017, believing that this bull market doesn't have the fundamental underpinnings to be one of the greatest of all time. What the firm wrote in its 2017 outlook note last month: "The S&P 500 has now been up on a total return basis for eight straight years of which we have been mostly bullish over that span. The all-time record for consecutive up years is nine (1991-1999), so another year of gains would tie that record, which would be great. We hope that 'Everything that's wonderful is sure to come your way,' but our concern is that there will at least be some trouble along the way. Markets typically climb a wall of worry, but right now there doesn't seem to be much of it around." For a group constantly accused of being perma-bulls, the 2017 outlooks are quite tepid. Recent history shows strategists have underestimated this bull market from the start. Given the gains on Tuesday, investors are betting they are doing it once again.

That's because credit card issuers have begun to respond to the Federal Reserve's short-term interest rate hike last month by boosting rates on credit card offers. I began tracking variable rate offers in November on 14 cards from popular credit card issuers in anticipation of the rate increases. All of those cards now have higher rates -- both on the low and high end of the ranges you see when applying for a card. RATE SEARCH: Look now for a low-interest credit card offer. The issuer determines your interest rate within the range based on your creditworthiness at the time of application. Increased rates on both ends of the credit spectrum means excellent credit won't provide you an escape from higher APRs. Every issuer I surveyed that has increased annual percentage rates since the Fed meeting has done so by the same 0.25 percent the central bank increased its benchmark interest rate. Credit card interest rates on the rise Credit card APR range as of Nov. 28, 2016 APR range as of Jan. 3, 2017 American Express Blue Cash Everyday 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% BankAmericard Cash Rewards 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Capital One Venture Rewards 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Capital One Quicksilver Rewards 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Chase Freedom 14.24% to 23.24% 14.49% to 23.49% Chase Slate 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Chase Sapphire Reserve 16.24% to 23.24% 16.49% to 23.49% Citi Simplicity 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Citi Double Cash 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Citi Thank You Preferred 13.24% to 23.24% 13.49% to 23.49% Citi Diamond Preferred 12.24% to 22.24% 12.49% to 22.49% Citi Prestige 15.49% 15.74% Discover it Card 11.24% to 23.24% 11.49% to 23.49% Wells Fargo Visa Signature 12.4% to 26.24% 12.65% to 26.49% Source: Issuer websites The only issuer among the ones I tracked not showing a rate change on its website: JPMorgan Chase. A spokeswoman for the bank's credit card division said its rates increased on Dec. 20, but had not yet been updated on marketing materials. Still, the impact of these rate increases across all cards hasn't yet been felt. Bankrate surveys 131 credit cards across 50 different issuers each week. As of the last week of 2016, the average variable interest rate was 16.27%, a slight increase over the previous week, although it's not even the high-water mark for the month. Impact on existing balances If you don't plan to apply for a new card in the new year, you're still not immune to a rate hike. While the Credit CARD Act of 2009 bans most retroactive rate increases, it does allow issuers to adjust APRs on variable rate cards tied to an index. Most cards are tied to the prime rate, which increases or decreases based on the Fed's own rate adjustments. CARD SEARCH: Delay your own personal interest rate hike by grabbing a good balance transfer card. Your credit card agreement will spell out how soon after the prime rate changes that you can expect a rate hike on your card. The most recent credit card agreements the issuers of the 14 credit cards I tracked filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau show generally you should feel the hike soon -- if you haven't already. The agreement for the Chase Freedom card, for example, says it will use the prime rate as published two business days before the end of each billing cycle. "If the U.S. Prime Rate changes, we’ll apply the new variable APR starting from the first day of the Billing Period when we take the U.S. Prime Rate from the (Wall Street Journal)," according to the agreement. My most recent American Express statement -- dated Dec. 22, little more than a week after the Fed increased rates -- already showed a change in my APR. The issuer bumped my interest rate from 17.49% APR to 17.74% APR. This isn't a big deal for me because I pay in full every month. But for others, this hike may pinch. Late payments could increase Prior to the rate hike, the credit bureau TransUnion calculated that a 0.25 percentage point rate hike would increase the average monthly payment on adjustable rate accounts by $6.45. Most consumers will be able to handle that additional cost, but 9.3 million Americans are expected to feel "payment shock" that could lead to late payments and defaults, TransUnion found.

If you CAN'T pay them off every month, then you couldn't afford whatever you bought in the first place... adam January 04, 2017 at 7:24 pm discover gives you worst apr regardless of creditworthiness.

By SueChang Markets reporter RyanVlastelica Markets reporter SueChang Markets reporter RyanVlastelica Markets reporter U.S. stocks on Tuesday started the first trading day of 2017 on a positive note but closed off of intraday highs as oil prices turned sharply lower, puncturing some of the initial exuberance that underpinned an early rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The Dow DJIA, -0.03%  rose 119.16 points, or 0.6%, to close at 19,881.76. The blue-chip index had gained as much as 176 points at one point during the session. Nike Inc. NKE, +0.99%  and Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -0.25%  were among the biggest gainers while Travelers Cos. Inc. TRV, +0.26% and McDonald’s Corp. MCD, -0.49% were notable laggards. The S&P 500 SPX, +0.18% also finished off its best levels, adding 19 points, or 0.9%, to end at 2,257.83. The index had been up as much as 25 points in early morning action. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +0.48%  climbed 45.97 points, or 0.9%, to close at 5,429.08. “Stocks started with a bit of a rally as the market tried to make up for some of the losses from last week,” said Mark Kepner, managing director of sales and trading at Themis Trading. However, the strong start out of the gate soon fizzled as oil turned weak. Crude futures CLG7, +0.21%  fell more than 2% after jumping as much as 2.6% as a deal by OPEC to limit output went into effect. The choppy action was the latest reminder of how the market has struggled in recent sessions with the Dow unable to break above 20,000, a key psychological milestone that some analysts see as a resistance level for the market. “Once you get closer to 20,000, historically it’s been hard to get through on the first pass,” said Kepner. Still, even though Wall Street stalled in the final sessions of 2016, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.1% in its last week of the year, it has been in a fairly pronounced uptrend since early November, when Trump won the U.S. presidential election. While financial stocks have accounted for the lion’s share of the market’s postelection gains, investors are betting that the policies Trump is expected to pursue will accelerate economic growth. That thesis is still viewed as intact, although the size and speed of the recent rally could lead investors to take profits. “There are people who say things are getting pricey, but corporate fundamentals are there. Even if Trump’s policies don’t come to fruition, I think the fundamentals are strong enough to keep the market rising,” said Peter Andersen, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co, who said he was “fairly optimistic” about U.S. stocks. Read: Stock-market bulls wary of new-year hangover In addition to Trump’s policies, investors will be monitoring the president-elect’s Twitter feed, which he has used to take shots at specific companies. On Tuesday, he criticized General Motors Co. GM, -0.45% in a tweet, writing that the company “is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers tax-free across border. Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!” While the stock fell in premarket trading, it subsequently turned higher, rising 0.9%. The tweet followed similar statements against Boeing Co. BA, +0.34%  and Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, +0.76%   “Trump is making it both easy and difficult for stock pickers,” said Andersen. “We’re getting surgical precision when it comes to commentary on specific companies, but we’re still getting our sea legs with how to interpret this data. It could be more symbolic than concrete in its meaning, but we don’t know. We’re in a steep learning curve with him.” In other company news, Xerox Corp. XRX, +1.59%  jumped 20% after Credit Suisse upgraded the company to “outperform.” What Trump's North Korea tweets mean(1:36) U.S. President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter again to plant a foreign-policy flag—this time on North Korea. Other markets: Equities rose across the globe, with Asian markets higher after encouraging Chinese manufacturing data and European stocks building on their gains from Monday, when U.S. markets were closed for the New Year’s holiday. A key dollar index DXY, +0.06% traded 1% higher while gold futures GCG7, +0.39%  settled up 0.9%. Economic news: In the latest economic data, the Institute for Supply Management said its manufacturing index climbed to 54.7% in December from 53.2%. The reading was higher than expected, and the highest level in two years.

Morgan Chase & Co. "There will be more concerns about the yuan," said Andrew Sullivan, managing director of sales trading at Haitong International Securities. China set the yuan USDCNY, -0.0986%  0.2% weaker against the U.S. dollar Tuesday amid broad global gains for the greenback. Tuesday's yuan fixing was the first to incorporate an expanded foreign-currencies basket, which now includes the Korean won and Saudi riyal. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 XJO, +0.43%  closed up 1.2%, Korea's Kospi SEU, -0.37%  edged up 0.9% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index HSI, -0.83%  closed up 0.7%. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average NIK, -0.66%  was closed for holiday. Chinese stocks jumped during trading Tuesday, buoyed by signs of economic recovery, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, -0.99%  finishing up 1%. China's December Caixin manufacturing PMI came in at 51.9. This was up from 50.9 a month ago, and the strongest level since early 2013. However, the Chinese market is dogged by persistent concerns of capital flight — concerns that are evident in rounds of regulatory tweaking. The People's Bank of China recently tightened its supervision of money transfers by individuals in China as part of its anti-money-laundering efforts. The central bank also lowered the threshold on the size of transactions that banks need to disclose to the PBOC — a move that analysts said should help reduce outflows. Speculation was also percolating over the weekend that Beijing would sharply limit Chinese citizens' ability to use their US$50,000 annual quota to convert yuan into foreign currencies, if they intended to use the money to invest offshore or buy overseas property. China's foreign-currency regulator clarified that this was always the case, but that it would pay more attention to enforcement of the rule. The rules do not stop investing by Chinese in Hong Kong stocks through the Connect scheme. The Shanghai Stock Exchange on Tuesday halted trading of China's 50-year government bonds due to "abnormal fluctuations," shortly after its price tumbled more than 10%. The bond's price tumble was unusual but analysts refrained in reading too much into it, as the ultralong bond is illiquid. The last time this bond traded was in mid-December, according to Pin Ru Tan, director of Asia-Pacific rates strategy at HSBC in Singapore. "Is the news surprising? Yes, to a certain extent. But it's consistent with what we've seen with the selloff in the interbank market," said Ms. Tan, adding that there was "nothing particularly alarming" about this latest development. Indonesia's government on Tuesday cut its business partnerships with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.53%  , pointing to a recent country downgrade by the U.S. bank. Indonesia's Finance Ministry said in a letter that, effective Jan. 1, it was ending all partnerships with J.P. Morgan due to research that could "potentially create disturbances in national financial system stability." Indonesia's stock market dropped 0.4%. Macau casino shares saw selling Tuesday. Sands China 1928, +0.00%  was down 0.3% and Galaxy Entertainment 0027, +0.00%  was off 1.3%. Fresh data showed gambling revenue in the enclave fell 3.3% to 223.2 billion patacas ($27.9 billion) last year, though revenues rose about 8% year-on-year in December.

You may be surprised to learn how many Bank of America customers prefer smartphones over bank branches. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jan 3, 2017 at 12:42PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. One of the things Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) points out whenever it gets the opportunity to do so is that a growing share of its customers are using its mobile banking app to do things they once did at one of its branches. According to Bank of America's latest data, it has 34 million active digital accounts -- online plus mobile -- with more than 21 million of those being active mobile users. Given that the North Carolina-based bank serves approximately 47 million consumer and small business customers, this means that 45% of them actively use its mobile app. This is a big deal because it's significantly cheaper for a bank to service customers by way of a mobile app than it is to service them in a branch or even through an ATM. Bank of America estimates that an automated deposit costs 90% less than an assisted deposit. Figures from JPMorgan Chase back this up. The nation's biggest bank by assets says it costs $0.65 to handle a deposit transaction in a branch, $0.08 per transaction conducted on an ATM, and just $0.03 per mobile deposit. The fact that Bank of America's customers are so readily adopting its mobile banking app has thus allowed the bank to meaningfully cut its expense base. The average cost per $100 in deposits has dropped by 34% since 2010, the bank noted earlier this year, going from $2.61 to $1.71 as of the first quarter of 2016. The main way this helps Bank of America is by allowing it to close branches. Over the past seven years, since CEO Brian Moynihan took the reins, Bank of America's branch count as declined by 20%, going from just under 6,000 branches at the beginning of 2010 down to approximately 4,600 today. Data source: Bank of America. Chart by author. Not coincidentally, this has also enabled Bank of America to reduce the number of people it employs. At the beginning of 2011, it employed the equivalent at 288,000 people. Today, that's down to only 209,000. And both of these trends should continue, leading to further cost savings at Bank of America. In the third quarter of this year, active users of its mobile app grew by 15.8%. That's less than the nearly 20% growth rates from a few years ago, but it's still impressive given that nearly half of its customers already use the app. With all of this in mind, and given the fact that 68% of deposit transactions at Bank of America are now done either on a mobile app or ATM, it makes sense why the bank's executives are so confident that they can continue cutting expenses.

Investors should purchase JPMorgan Chase shares because its financial results will top expectations in 2017 due to a better business environment and Donald Trump's agenda, according to Barclays, which reiterated its overweight rating on the bank. "We are attracted to JPM's competitive positioning and believe it has addressed a great deal of its litigation concerns. We see the greatest sources of potential upside being driven by higher loan growth and capital markets," analyst Jason Goldberg wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. "JPM is our new top pick."

(Photo: American Club) The American P&I Club was founded in New York nearly a century ago. To celebrate its first 100 years, a book entitled The American Club: A Centennial History has just been published.   The book tells the story of the Club across ten decades of maritime and marine insurance history both within the United States and across the world. Its author is Richard Blodgett, a former Wall Street Journal reporter whose previous credits include histories of the New York Stock Exchange, Kohler and Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.   The American Club was founded in February, 1917. War was raging in Europe when the Club began. At that time, P&I insurance was available primarily from clubs in the United Kingdom and Scandinavia. In consequence of UK government trade-related sanctions which had been imposed on certain US shipowners in 1916, the American Club was established to provide a reliable source of coverage in the United States.   The Club was the brainchild of W. H. LaBoyteaux, President of Johnson & Higgins, the leading US marine insurance broker in the United States at that time. The Club was an immediate success, enjoying the support of many of the foremost US steamship companies.   The size of the American merchant marine fluctuated in the 1920s and 1930s. It grew during World War II, but entered a prolonged period of decline thereafter. In the decades from 1950 onward, the worldwide merchant fleet grew steadily. But nearly all that growth was taking place outside the United States.   Although the Club only admitted its first foreign-flagged member in 1980, it had ambitions of further international growth over the years which followed. These ambitions gained momentum in 1995 when the Club implemented a major strategy for growth and diversification.   Entitled Vision 2000, it called for new leadership, the expansion of the Club’s membership internationally, the establishment of overseas offices, the development of new insurance lines and many other initiatives designed to place the Club at the forefront of its industry peers.   In 1998 the American Club became a full member of the International Group of P&I Clubs. This alliance of leading insurers provides outstanding security and technical resources to the maritime community. It also supports the industry's broader interests as one of shipping's most influential voices.   Today, the American Club is thoroughly international in scope, offers the broadest range of marine insurance products and is larger and more successful than ever. On the threshold of its centennial year, Members domiciled outside North America account for about 85% of the Club’s insured tonnage.   Joe Hughes, Chairman and CEO of the American Club’s managers, Shipowners Claims Bureau, Inc., also commented: “Today the American Club is thoroughly international in scope, offers a broad range of marine insurance products and is larger and more successful than ever. At present, members domiciled outside North America account for some 85 percent of the Club’s insured tonnage. What was founded in 1917 as an American Club serving the American steamship industry has successfully recast itself as an American Club serving the global maritime community, building on the enduring values of its long traditions.” Email Related News Two saved from Sinking Boat off Coast of Maine The Coast Guard rescued two people off their sinking vessel Friday, about 17 miles off shore from York, Maine.

News Trump Has Private-Jet Makers Feeling Optimistic About Market Private jet makers are optimistic that business will take off under President-elect Trump. (©Maksym Dragunov - Fotolia/stock.adobe.com) BLOOMBERG NEWS 1/03/2017 Reprints Ever since the U.S. presidential election, Ed Dahlberg has pretty much had a smile on his face. Dahlberg brokers the sale of private jets, and already he's seeing interest pick up and used-aircraft prices starting to firm up. The sale of a single-engine turboprop aircraft that he recently handled went for about 5% more than anticipated. "My phone is ringing off the hook" from people interested in buying used jets, said Dahlberg, president of Emerald Aviation Inc. in Manassas, Va. "Just the business climate feels like it's getting better." The era of Donald Trump, a man long associated with conspicuous consumption, figures to be good to a whole range of luxury-goods industries. But perhaps nowhere is that excitement greater than in the private-aircraft business. Not only is Trump, whose personal Boeing 757 became an iconic campaign image, seen as someone who'll be an advocate for the industry but he replaces a president who so often criticized private-air travel that he turned it into a taboo symbol of inequality and helped prolong a sales slump of almost a decade. "You'll see more people not being gun shy or embarrassed or apologetic for operating a corporate jet," said Steve Varsano, founder of broker The Jet Business. Bigger Sales In 2008 Demand for private jets is far from the heady days of more than 1,000 deliveries in 2007 and 2008, before the recession hit. In 2016, manufacturers were set to ship 655 jets, according to a JPMorgan Chase estimate, lower than 689 in both 2014 and 2015 after an oil boom that had boosted sales among drillers went bust. Used jet prices have tumbled 12% since November 2015, the bank said. It's far too early to see any sales pickup, of course, and the industry buzz of a comeback is just that at the moment. But investors are encouraged. Shares of private jet manufacturers have soared on Trump's victory. Since Nov. 9, Textron (TXT) gained 19%, General Dynamics (GD) rose 12% and Bombardier Inc. jumped 22%. Aircraft sales amount to about 30% of their revenue. "The Trump win looks positive for (business) jet demand given the postelection stock surge, economic stimulus from an expected lower tax rate and less regulation, and shift away from Obama's anti-(business) jet rhetoric," Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., wrote in a report earlier this month. Alain Bellemare, chief executive officer of Canadian plane maker Bombardier, said in an interview that in Trump he sees "somebody understanding the value of business aircraft and what it creates." "Anybody who is pro-business, pro-growth, who will foster investment in infrastructure — it's all good for our business," he said. "So I hear the tone now and I'm optimistic." North America Jobs Most of the manufacturing jobs to produce corporate jets are in North America, Bellemare said. That fits in with Trump's theme of keeping factory workers in the U.S. Both Bombardier and Textron's Cessna unit make aircraft in Wichita, Kan. Gulfstream, the corporate jet unit of General Dynamics, has its factories in Savannah, Ga. Even Brazilian jet producer Embraer (ERJ) manufactures planes in Melbourne, Fla. Trade groups have long argued that private aircraft are business tools that help executives save time and make multicity visits they otherwise couldn't with commercial flights. For security, some companies mandate their top officers fly on the corporate plane. That message was lost when auto executives flew to Washington in their private planes to request bailout money in November 2008, sparking a backlash as the economy careened into recession. A call from a Treasury Department official in 2009 persuaded Citigroup (C), which was getting U.S. government rescue funds, to drop plans to take delivery of a $50 million Falcon 7X aircraft manufactured by Dassault Aviation (DASTY). In a 2011 press conference, Obama called out private jet owners six times to bash a tax break that allows corporate planes to be depreciated over five years instead of seven years for commercial airliners. The National Business Aviation Association sent the president a letter expressing "disappointment with the way you mischaracterized and disparaged business aviation." But that was then, as broker Dahlberg sees it. "I've noticed that while there's still a huge amount of inventory, people just don't keep dropping the price every week," he said. "You can really feel the floor in the market right now."

After coming within a hair’s breadth of the milestone in December as part of a post-election rally, the Dow was trading just 0.46 percent shy of the psychological milestone. The Dow rose 13.4 percent in 2016 – its best performance in three years – registering strong gains in the past two months as investors bet that Presidential-elect Donald Trump would introduce market friendly policies such as tax cuts and simpler regulation. Banks were the main drivers of the gains on Wall Street on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 financial sector rising 1.33 percent. Barclays raised price targets on several Wall Street banks including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan. Goldman Sachs rose 1.5 percent to $243.50 and was the top stock on the Dow. Feeding Wall Street’s gains were oil prices, which hit an 18-month high as a deal to cut output took effect on Sunday, and upbeat China factory data. The dollar index was on a tear, notching its best day in nearly three weeks at 103.37, while higher inflation data sent European stocks to a one-year high.

No pricing details were given in the filing, but the offering is valued up to $150 million. The company intends to list its shares on the Nasdaq under the symbol BBRX. The underwriters for the offering are JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank. This year has been dismal for IPOs, but prospects could pick up next year. With 2017 just around the corner and markets reaching new highs, it looks like even more IPOs are coming. This is a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel long-acting medications for serious disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). Braeburn’s proprietary implantable and injectable delivery mechanisms provide differentiated solutions for chronic diseases with high unmet medical needs. The company’s specialty CNS focus is on fast-growing therapeutic areas recognized as serious public health crises, where long-acting technologies offer important benefits such as increased medication compliance, improved patient convenience, reduced risk of abuse and relapse and reduced public health and societal costs. Braeburn’s lead therapeutic area is opioid addiction, which affects 2.6 million people in the United States across all socioeconomic groups. A 2016 survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation indicates that nearly half of all Americans know someone who suffers from opioid addiction. The company has one approved product, Probuphine, a six-month buprenorphine implant for the maintenance treatment of opioid addiction, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2016. In November 2016, the company reported positive top-line results from a Phase 3 trial of weekly and monthly CAM2038, an injectable formulation of buprenorphine, for opioid addiction. CAM2038 achieved non-inferiority compared to oral daily buprenorphine based on the primary endpoint and superiority to oral daily buprenorphine based on a secondary endpoint. Other therapeutic areas of focus are pain, schizophrenia and spasticity, which refers to feelings of stiffness and a wide range of involuntary muscle spasms. The company has four additional late-stage product candidates in its pipeline across different therapeutic areas, as well as two earlier-stage product candidates. The company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for the commercialization of Probuphine, and the advancement of product candidates in clinical development. The remainder will fund ongoing research and development activities, working capital and other general corporate purposes.

After coming within a hair’s breadth of the milestone in December as part of a post-election rally, the Dow was trading just 0.46 percent shy of the psychological milestone. The Dow rose 13.4 percent in 2016 — its best performance in three years — registering strong gains in the past two months as investors bet that Presidential-elect Donald Trump would introduce market-friendly policies such as tax cuts and simpler regulation. Banks were the main drivers of the gains on Wall Street on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 financial sector .SPSY rising 1.33 percent. Barclays raised price targets on several Wall Street banks including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan. Goldman Sachs rose 1.5 percent to $243.50 and was the top stock on the Dow. Feeding Wall Street’s gains were oil prices, which hit an 18-month high as a deal to cut output took effect on Sunday, and upbeat China factory data. The dollar index .DXY was on a tear, notching its best day in nearly three weeks at 103.37, while higher inflation data sent European stocks to a one-year high. At 9:40 a.m. ET, the Dow .DJI was up 143.1 points, or 0.72 percent, at 19,905.7, the S&P 500 .SPX was up 16.11 points, or 0.72 percent, at 2,254.94 and the Nasdaq Composite index .IXIC was up 38.05 points, or 0.71 percent, at 5,421.16. Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 indexes were higher, with the defensive real estate .SPLRCR and consumer staples .SPLRCS sectors bringing up the rear. Utilities .SPLRCU, another defensive sector, was the only one in the red. Marathon Petroleum rose 6.8 percent to $53.74 after the company said it would explore a spinoff of its retail business, caving to pressure from activist investor Elliott Management. Xerox was the biggest percentage gainer on the S&P, rising nearly 16 percent, after the company said it completed the separation of its BPO unit Conduent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,121 to 597. On the Nasdaq, 1,900 issues rose and 545 fell.

Morgan Chase & Co. “There will be more concerns about the yuan,” said Andrew Sullivan, managing director of sales trading at Haitong International Securities. China set the yuan USDCNY, +0.2232% 0.2% weaker against the U.S. dollar Tuesday amid broad global gains for the greenback. –– ADVERTISEMENT –– Tuesday’s yuan fixing was the first to incorporate an expanded foreign-currencies basket, which now includes the Korean won and Saudi riyal. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 XJO, +1.19% closed up 1.2%, Korea’s Kospi SEU, +0.88% edged up 0.9% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index HSI, +0.68% closed up 0.7%. Japan’s Nikkei Stock Average NIK, -0.16% was closed for holiday. Chinese stocks jumped during trading Tuesday, buoyed by signs of economic recovery, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +1.04% finishing up 1%. China’s December Caixin manufacturing PMI came in at 51.9. This was up from 50.9 a month ago, and the strongest level since early 2013. However, the Chinese market is dogged by persistent concerns of capital flight — concerns that are evident in rounds of regulatory tweaking. The People’s Bank of China recently tightened its supervision of money transfers by individuals in China as part of its anti-money-laundering efforts. The central bank also lowered the threshold on the size of transactions that banks need to disclose to the PBOC — a move that analysts said should help reduce outflows. Speculation was also percolating over the weekend that Beijing would sharply limit Chinese citizens’ ability to use their US$50,000 annual quota to convert yuan into foreign currencies, if they intended to use the money to invest offshore or buy overseas property. China’s foreign-currency regulator clarified that this was always the case, but that it would pay more attention to enforcement of the rule. The rules do not stop investing by Chinese in Hong Kong stocks through the Connect scheme. The Shanghai Stock Exchange on Tuesday halted trading of China’s 50-year government bonds due to “abnormal fluctuations,” shortly after its price tumbled more than 10%. The bond’s price tumble was unusual but analysts refrained in reading too much into it, as the ultralong bond is illiquid. The last time this bond traded was in mid-December, according to Pin Ru Tan, director of Asia-Pacific rates strategy at HSBC in Singapore. “Is the news surprising? Yes, to a certain extent. But it’s consistent with what we’ve seen with the selloff in the interbank market,” said Ms. Tan, adding that there was “nothing particularly alarming” about this latest development. Indonesia’s government on Tuesday cut its business partnerships with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +0.47% , pointing to a recent country downgrade by the U.S. bank. Indonesia’s Finance Ministry said in a letter that, effective Jan. 1, it was ending all partnerships with J.P. Morgan due to research that could “potentially create disturbances in national financial system stability.” Indonesia’s stock market dropped 0.4%. Macau casino shares saw selling Tuesday. Sands China 1928, -0.30% was down 0.3% and Galaxy Entertainment 0027, -1.33% was off 1.3%. Fresh data showed gambling revenue in the enclave fell 3.3% to 223.2 billion patacas ($27.9 billion) last year, though revenues rose about 8% year-on-year in December.

COURTESY BLOOMBERG Print Email Comment Tweet Posted: Tuesday, January 3, 2017 9:10 am By Thomas Black and Frederic Tomesco Bloomberg News technology Analyst raises price target on Textron (Dec. 28, 2016) workforce Textron undergoing restructuring, no changes planned for Prov. (Aug. 31, 2016) media Forbes: F.M. Global, Textron make America’s best employers list (April 4, 2016) DALLAS - Ever since the U.S. presidential election, Ed Dahlberg has pretty much had a smile on his face. He brokers the sale of private jets, and already he’s seeing interest pick up and used-aircraft prices starting to firm up. The sale of a single-engine turboprop aircraft that he recently handled went for about 5 percent more than anticipated. “My phone is ringing off the hook” from people interested in buying used jets, said Dahlberg, president of Emerald Aviation Inc. in Manassas, Va. “Just the business climate feels like it’s getting better.” The era of Donald Trump, a man long associated with conspicuous consumption, figures to be good to a whole range of luxury-goods industries. But perhaps nowhere is that excitement greater than in the private-aircraft business. Not only is Trump, whose personal Boeing 757 became an iconic campaign image, seen as someone who’ll be an advocate for the industry but he replaces a president who so often criticized private-air travel that he turned it into a taboo symbol of inequality and helped prolong an almost-decade-long sales slump. “You’ll see more people not being gun shy or embarrassed or apologetic for operating a corporate jet,” said Steve Varsano, founder of broker The Jet Business. <a href="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/click/zone?zid=1&pid=0&lookup=true&position=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> <img src="http://adserver.pbn.com/servlet/view/banner/image/zone?zid=1&pid=0&position=1" height="60" width="468" hspace="0" vspace="0" border="0" alt="Click Here!"> </a> Demand for private jets is far from the heady days of more than 1,000 deliveries in 2007 and 2008, before the recession hit. In 2016, manufacturers were set to ship 655 jets, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimate, lower than 689 in both 2014 and 2015 after an oil boom that had boosted sales among drillers went bust. Used jet prices have tumbled 12 percent since November 2015, the bank said. Shares up It’s far too early to see any sales pickup, of course, and the industry buzz of a comeback is just that at the moment. But investors are encouraged. Shares of private jet manufacturers have soared on Trump’s victory. Since Nov. 9, Textron Inc. gained 19 percent, General Dynamics Corp. rose 12 percent and Bombardier Inc. jumped 22 percent. Aircraft sales amount to about 30 percent of their revenue. “The Trump win looks positive for bizjet demand given the post-election stock surge, economic stimulus from an expected lower tax rate and less regulation, and shift away from Obama’s anti-bizjet rhetoric,” Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., wrote in a report earlier this month. Alain Bellemare, CEO of Canadian planemaker Bombardier, said in an interview that in Trump he sees “somebody understanding the value of business aircraft and what it creates.” “Anybody who is pro-business, pro-growth, who will foster investment in infrastructure -- it’s all good for our business,” he said. “So I hear the tone now and I’m optimistic.” Most of the manufacturing jobs to produce corporate jets are in North America, Bellemare said. That fits in with Trump’s theme of keeping factory workers in the U.S. Both Bombardier and Textron’s Cessna unit make aircraft in Wichita, Kan. Gulfstream, the corporate jet unit of General Dynamics, has its factories in Savannah, Ga. Even Brazilian jet producer Embraer SA manufactures planes in Melbourne, Fla. Trade groups have long argued that private aircraft are business tools that help executives save time and make multi-city visits they otherwise couldn’t with commercial flights. For security, some companies mandate their top officers fly on the corporate plane. That message was lost when auto executives flew to Washington in their private planes to request bailout money in November 2008, sparking a backlash as the economy careened into recession. A call from a Treasury Department official in 2009 persuaded Citigroup Inc., which was getting U.S. government rescue funds, to drop plans to take delivery of a $50 million Falcon 7X aircraft manufactured by Dassault Aviation SA. In a 2011 press conference, Obama called out private jet owners six times to bash a tax break that allows corporate planes to be depreciated over five years instead of seven years for commercial airliners. The National Business Aviation Association sent the president a letter expressing “disappointment with the way you mischaracterized and disparaged business aviation.” But that was then, as broker Dahlberg sees it. “I’ve noticed that while there’s still a huge amount of inventory, people just don’t keep dropping the price every week,” he said. “You can really feel the floor in the market right now.” Keywords private jet sales, Textron, Rhode Island, Providence, Cessna Print Email Comment Tweet Comments No comments on this story | Please log in to comment by clicking here Please log in or register to add your comment Related Stories technology Analyst raises price target on Textron (Dec. 28, 2016) workforce Textron undergoing restructuring, no changes planned for Prov.

He brokers the sale of private jets, and already he’s seeing interest pick up and used-aircraft prices starting to firm up. The sale of a single-engine turboprop aircraft that he recently handled went for about 5 percent more than anticipated. “My phone is ringing off the hook” from people interested in buying used jets, said Dahlberg, president of Emerald Aviation Inc. in Manassas, Virginia. “Just the business climate feels like it’s getting better.” The era of Donald Trump, a man long associated with conspicuous consumption, figures to be good to a whole range of luxury-goods industries. But perhaps nowhere is that excitement greater than in the private-aircraft business. Not only is Trump, whose personal Boeing 757 became an iconic campaign image, seen as someone who’ll be an advocate for the industry but he replaces a president who so often criticized private-air travel that he turned it into a taboo symbol of inequality and helped prolong an almost-decade-long sales slump. “You’ll see more people not being gun shy or embarrassed or apologetic for operating a corporate jet,” said Steve Varsano, founder of broker The Jet Business. Demand for private jets is far from the heady days of more than 1,000 deliveries in 2007 and 2008, before the recession hit. In 2016, manufacturers were set to ship 655 jets, according to a JPMorgan Chase & Co. estimate, lower than 689 in both 2014 and 2015 after an oil boom that had boosted sales among drillers went bust. Used jet prices have tumbled 12 percent since November 2015, the bank said. Shares Up It’s far too early to see any sales pickup, of course, and the industry buzz of a comeback is just that at the moment. But investors are encouraged. Shares of private jet manufacturers have soared on Trump’s victory. Since Nov. 9, Textron Inc. gained 19 percent, General Dynamics Corp. rose 12 percent and Bombardier Inc. jumped 22 percent. Aircraft sales amount to about 30 percent of their revenue. “The Trump win looks positive for bizjet demand given the post-election stock surge, economic stimulus from an expected lower tax rate and less regulation, and shift away from Obama’s anti-bizjet rhetoric,” Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., wrote in a report earlier this month. Alain Bellemare, chief executive officer of Canadian planemaker Bombardier, said in an interview that in Trump he sees “somebody understanding the value of business aircraft and what it creates.” “Anybody who is pro-business, pro-growth, who will foster investment in infrastructure -- it’s all good for our business,” he said. “So I hear the tone now and I’m optimistic.” Read more: A QuickTake on the Sharing Economy Travel with us, drive with us, eat with us.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Most of the manufacturing jobs to produce corporate jets are in North America, Bellemare said. That fits in with Trump’s theme of keeping factory workers in the U.S. Both Bombardier and Textron’s Cessna unit make aircraft in Wichita, Kansas. Gulfstream, the corporate jet unit of General Dynamics, has its factories in Savannah, Georgia. Even Brazilian jet producer Embraer SA manufactures planes in Melbourne, Florida. Gulfstream G450 business jet Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg Trade groups have long argued that private aircraft are business tools that help executives save time and make multi-city visits they otherwise couldn’t with commercial flights. For security, some companies mandate their top officers fly on the corporate plane. That message was lost when auto executives flew to Washington in their private planes to request bailout money in November 2008, sparking a backlash as the economy careened into recession. A call from a Treasury Department official in 2009 persuaded Citigroup Inc., which was getting U.S. government rescue funds, to drop plans to take delivery of a $50 million Falcon 7X aircraft manufactured by Dassault Aviation SA. In a 2011 press conference, Obama called out private jet owners six times to bash a tax break that allows corporate planes to be depreciated over five years instead of seven years for commercial airliners. The National Business Aviation Association sent the president a letter expressing “disappointment with the way you mischaracterized and disparaged business aviation.” But that was then, as broker Dahlberg sees it. “I’ve noticed that while there’s still a huge amount of inventory, people just don’t keep dropping the price every week,” he said. “You can really feel the floor in the market right now.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Subscribe today! By Tim Feran The Columbus Dispatch  •  Tuesday January 3, 2017 12:57 PM It’s a common complaint: Tech jobs go begging because there aren’t enough qualified people to fill them. One answer to that concern, Columbus computer-coding boot camp Tech Elevator, sent its first 12 graduates off to new careers this fall and is preparing to expand its class size to 14 this year. Originally launched in 2015 in Cleveland to provide tech talent in that city, Tech Elevator opened offices in Columbus tech incubator Rev1 Ventures early in 2016 after realizing that many of its students were traveling to Cleveland to attend the intensive 14-week program. Although the supply-demand imbalance in tech workers is bad in Cleveland, it’s even worse in Columbus. In 2015, more than 13,000 software-related jobs were advertised in Franklin County, but Ohio State University conferred just 220 computer-science degrees, according to job-market analytics firm Burning Glass Technologies. “When you think about it, you’ve got Progressive up in Cleveland” seeking programmers, said Anthony Hughes, CEO of Tech Elevator, “but you’ve got major, major consumers of tech talent down here, like Nationwide, JPMorgan Chase, L Brands, Huntington, Cardinal Health and so many others." Almost all of Tech Elevator’s target students are older than typical college age and have been in the work force for years. “But they all have a level of maturity, something employers really like,” Hughes said. Columbus-based health-care technology company CoverMyMeds, for example, is among the companies that hired from Tech Elevator. “We were happy to bring one of their graduates onboard,” said Kelly Nestor, a technical recruiter at CoverMyMeds. “We need to hire the best and brightest in the tech space, (and) the Tech Elevator program helps develop skill sets we’re looking for.” The first class, for example, included: • Gabriel Sheeley, 34, who had been a carpenter for almost a decade when he read about the need for more software developers. But the path to obtaining the skills needed would have taken six years of night classes, Sheeley said. • Keith Williams, 32, who had been working at Ohio Means Jobs and helped one person land a tech job with a salary and career possibilities that far outstripped his own. “I had thought about going back to school,” Williams said, “but with five kids — including 18-month-old twins — I needed something quick.” • Hilary Stork, 36, who had been a math teacher for nine years in the Delaware city district and “loved teaching, but more and more was being piled on me, something that’s happening not just in Delaware but all over Ohio.” She had intended to enroll at Ohio State, “but it was going to drag on for years. I was not enthusiastic about doing that.” The three went through Tech Elevator’s rigorous interview process and then jumped into the even more rigorous course of study. “We call it a ‘drinking from a firehose’ experience,” Hughes said, chuckling. “You have to have pretty good cognitive horsepower to absorb the material.” The program comes at a cost. At $12,000, tuition “is not couch change,” Hughes said. “But we recognize that, and we have organizations willing to lend money, up to $16,000, to cover students’ living expenses while they’re taking the course.” In addition to teaching the students about coding, Tech Elevator has a “soft skills” curriculum that helps students write resumes and hone interview skills. The students put those skills to the test during a “speed dating” event with potential employers. The comprehensiveness of the entire experience means that the students have been not only well-trained but also well-vetted by the time they meet a potential employer. The result: 85 percent of job offers come within two weeks of graduation. Or, as was the case in the first Columbus class, before graduation. Stork, for example, had a job offer from JPMorgan Chase, Sheeley had been hired by Pillar Technologies, and at the time he was interviewed, Williams was weighing two offers. “We told them, don’t pick just a salary,” Hughes said. “Pick a boss, pick an opportunity. Your career is so dependent on the people above you, the people who will mentor you.” “They’re in a position now where they’re in control of their careers in a way that a lot of people aren’t.” tferan@dispatch.com @timferan Favorite Print Story Advertisement • Place an ad News Video More Videos Advertisement • Place an ad Explore Columbus Search Businesses Featured Businesses Loading...

Meet China's own Donald Trump By Bloomberg | Updated: Jan 03, 2017, 01.58 PM IST Post a Comment READ MORE ON » JPMorgan Chase & Co | Hong Kong | Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao Football Club | Evergrande | Donald Trump | china evergrande group Hui is said to have justified many acquisitions by saying they provide tangible cash flows. In aggregate, however, they've lost money. Image: Evergrande website By Christopher Langner Hui Ka Yan may not realise it, but he has a lot in common with Donald Trump. Like the president-elect, the founder and chairman of China Evergrande Group, the country's largest developer by assets, traces his fortune to property and built it on a mountain of debt. Hui also has a penchant for grandeur and excess. JPMorgan Chase & Co slammed his purchase of a Hong Kong office tower as "another example of immature capital management," while Jackson Martinez, the Colombian striker for his Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao Football Club, is one of soccer's top earners. Hui also had to liquidate his five-bedroom mansion complete with infinity pool overlooking Sydney Harbor because the purchase violated foreign investment rules. The parallels don't stop there, considering many investors in the Chinese company's real-estate bonds are wondering just how sound Hui is financially. Evergrande has not only spent billions buying land, but also a lot of other things, from a mineral-water outfit to an insurance firm and soccer team. Evergrande outstanding bonds - $12.5 billion Hui is said to have justified many acquisitions by saying they provide tangible cash flows. In aggregate, however, they've lost money. Hui, whose net worth is about $7.4 billion, has started disposing of some, listing Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao Football Club and selling the beverages and foods business. He has made some decent returns. According to Evergrande's 2013 annual report, the spring-water company was acquired for 109 million yuan ($15.7 million), and a later filing shows it was sold for 1.8 billion yuan. Including losses incurred during the period takes some of the sheen off, however. Could it be that the 58-year-old developer is starting to feel the weight of debt he's accumulated? Not only is Evergrande's leverage through the roof, it's also not helping returns anymore. One positive resulting from the divestments is that Evergrande is beginning to refocus on its core business of property development. But there's still the propensity for grandstanding. Evergrande has spent the past few months building a 14 percent stake in China Vanke Co., which was the nation's largest real-estate company until Evergrande overtook it. It's unclear what Hui plans to do with that interest. If he pushes for a merger, some of Evergrande's debt woes may be resolved, considering Vanke has managed to build a powerhouse on a relatively conservative balance sheet. Hui's ultimate aim may be something else entirely, and it is true that some of his most expensive investments in the past have turned out well. He's certainly a man who has strong connections with other property magnates, and is loyal to them. Much of the $1.6 billion he paid for Hong Kong's Mass Mutual Tower in November 2015, for example, went to Joseph Lau, through Lau's controlling stake in the building's previous owner, Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd. In 2010, Lau helped out Hui, buying $600 million of senior Evergrande bonds. Similarly, in December 2015, Evergrande purchased some resort projects for 13.5 billion yuan from New World Development Co, which booked a 5.4 billion yuan one-time profit on the transaction. Several weeks later, New World bought $900 million of perpetual notes from Evergrande. Evergrande continues to find sources of funding, even when its debt levels have garnered a CCC rating on some of its securities, a score associated with imminent default. Bondholders should hope that against the backdrop of softening property prices in Asia's largest economy, Hui has their back, too.

Darmin said on Tuesday that the research institution, a subsidiary of the United States-based investment bank JP Morgan Chase, had conducted analysis, the results of which outline the conditions of the Indonesian economy. “I have not read [the JP Morgan report]. But the fact that the Finance Minister has made a decision is good,” said Darmin in Jakarta, adding that the results of the research were not credible as reported by tribunnews.com. Sri Mulyani terminated a partnership with JPMargan Chase Bank after the firm came up with a report that created negative sentiment toward Indonesia. The Finance Ministry’s decision is stated in a letter to the company on Dec. 9. The letter said the termination of the cooperation would be effective starting Jan. 1. Darmin said he did not know the standard used by the company in analyzing the Indonesian economy. “I do not know, but so far, our condition is good based on the assessment of analysts,” he added. In its report, JP Morgan’s emerging market equity strategist downgraded Indonesia – by two notches – from overweight to underweight, while downgrading Turkey from Neutral to Underweight and Brazil from overweight to neutral.

The finance ministry will stop using JPMorgan as a primary dealer and as an underwriter of its sovereign bonds, Robert Pakpahan, the ministry’s director-general for budget financing and risk management told reporters in Jakarta on Tuesday. He said a November research report issued by the bank was not "accurate or credible." JPMorgan downgraded Indonesia’s equity market by two notches to underweight from overweight in a Nov. 13 report as a “tactical response” to the Trump election win. The bank also downgraded Brazil, while noting that both countries may provide a "better buying opportunity” later. JPMorgan’s business in Indonesia continues to operate as normal, the bank said in an e-mailed statement on Tuesday. “The impact on our clients is minimal and we continue to work with the Ministry of Finance to resolve the matter,” it said. The biggest U.S. bank was part of a underwriting syndicate when Indonesia sold 3 billion euros ($3.1 billion) of bonds in June. The lender wasn’t listed as a member of syndicates for two more recent offerings denominated in yen and U.S. dollars, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.   Tax Payments Any tax payments by Indonesian companies which were previously routed through JPMorgan will now be passed to the government via other banks, according to Bank Indonesia Governor Agus Martowardojo.

"I don’t think it will affect investor interest in Indonesia but it does reflect the difficulty of sell-side analysts to provide independent and objective opinions to their clients without upsetting the government officials and regulators," Richardson said. Foreign investors sold a net $2.8 billion of Indonesian stocks and bonds last quarter as investors dumped emerging-market assets following Trump’s victory. That drove the rupiah lower, forcing policy makers to intervene to stabilize the currency. Banks should take responsibility for economic reports that "could influence fundamentals and psychology," Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said Tuesday, when asked to comment on the termination of the JPMorgan relationship. JPMorgan provides investment and commercial banking services to the public and private sectors in Indonesia, according to the bank’s website. It obtained an Indonesian banking license in 1968 in the name of Chase Manhattan, and opened a branch in Jakarta, followed by a representative office in 1978.

The stakes couldn’t be higher for the proposal to rezone the iconic but declining Grand Central-area office district, which is expected to begin the city’s formal land-use review process on Tuesday after years of false starts. Rezoning to allow large, modern new buildings to rise is critical to saving the 73-block district from galloping obsolescence. Existing buildings, hobbled by ancient infrastructure unsuited to today’s digitally attuned companies, are an average 70 years old, mainly because 1961 zoning rules made replacing them near-impossible. Freeing the area from the straitjacket could restore its allure to companies needing 21st-century bells and whistles. “It’s critical for East Midtown’s viability,” said law firm Fried, Frank’s real estate chairman, Jonathan Mechanic. “It will no longer deteriorate, but will again become the central business district that New York City needs.” If the Department of City Planning measure survives the seven-month Uniform Land Use Review Procedure, which requires approval by the City Council and the mayor, it will bring a net increase over 20 years of more than 6 million square feet of office space to the district’s current 90 million square feet, the DCP projects. But the area will gain more than 15 million square feet of modern, state-of-the-art space because some old buildings will be torn down for new ones. Rezoning’s fate is being closely followed by landlords who want the option to redevelop older properties — among them, publicly traded SL Green, Vornado and Brookfield; privately held Rudin Management and the Durst Organization; and companies that own their office towers such as JPMorgan Chase and Pfizer. City planners say rezoning will add nearly $800 million of upgrades to subway stations and above-ground streetscapes without costing taxpayers a dime. That’s because, in order to put up larger new buildings, developers in designated “transit zones” must pay for and build the subway improvements at six Midtown stations. Plus, sellers of air rights must donate a portion of sale values to a “public realm” fund that will pay for sidewalk-level upgrades. The old zoning is so restrictive that East Midtown buildings that were constructed before 1961 can’t legally be replaced by new buildings even of the same size. An overdue but unpopular attempt to rezone the area under former Mayor Michael Bloomberg was yanked in 2013. It failed to spell out what transit upgrades developers would have to deliver. Owners of landmarks such as Grand Central Terminal and houses of worship couldn’t sell air rights except to next-door sites that weren’t suitable for development. The new plan gets rid of those weaknesses. City Planning Commissioner Carl Weisbrod led the team effort, but a source noted, “It couldn’t have happened without enthusiastic participation by [Manhattan Borough President] Gale Brewer and [Council member] Dan Garodnick” — both of whom opposed the earlier proposal, but recognized the need for change. The city rezoned one important but small slice of the area in 2014 — Vanderbilt Avenue, where SL Green’s One Vanderbilt is rising next to Grand Central Terminal. But the new, much more ambitious proposal covers roughly from East 39th to East 57th streets, and from Third to Fifth avenues. A draft environmental impact statement posted online over the weekend spells out its key provisions. It would increase permissible new building size from today’s mostly 12 to 15 “floor-to-area ratio” (FAR) — the measure of how much floor space can be built on a lot of a particular size — to as much as 18 FAR in some parts of the district and up to 27 FAR in others. However, the current “base” FAR limits won’t change. To add to them, developers in the “transit zones” can only gain additional FAR by paying for, and constructing, new facilities specified by the MTA at six subway stations. At the Fifth Avenue/53d Street E and M stop, for example, they include a new Madison Avenue street entrance and a new mezzanine. In other parts of East Midtown, developers could raise FAR only by buying unused air rights from owners of landmarks throughout the district, not only from those next door. Sellers would donate 20 percent of the sale price to a “public-realm fund” for sidewalk-level improvements, to be run by a panel of mayoral appointees and community stakeholders. The city must receive a minimum $78 per square foot on each transaction — a figure that values the average prospective air-rights sale at nearly $400 per square foot. The public-realm fund would also collect a fee from owners of older buildings wishing to replace them with new ones of the same size, but larger than 1961 rules allowed. Change can’t come too soon. “Important companies have been relocating to areas that are able to have modern, 21st Century buildings — especially to Hudson Yards and the World Trade Center,” warned CBRE tristate CEO Mary Ann Tighe. BlackRock, Wells Fargo, Point72 and several major law firms have already moved out or plan to. Rudin Management Company co-vice chairman and CEO William Rudin told The Post, “The prospect of passage of rezoning in 2017 is critically important to maintaining New York as a global capital and will send a message to the world regarding the development potential for Midtown.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Filed under grand central station ,  Real Estate ,  realty check ,  rezoning ,  subways Share this article: Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Copy Read Next What America's brightest designers want to do in 2017 Read Next What America's brightest designers want to do in 2017 Most Popular This Week 1 Hell gets ready to welcome Charles Manson 2 Buzzfeed's Trump report takes 'fake news' to a new level 3 Giants blamed for trashing airplane after playoff blowout 4 Obese woman is now a stunning model thanks to 'teaspoon diet' 5 It's 'digital heroin': How screens turn kids into psychotic junkies 6 12-year-old girl live streams her suicide in front yard Share Selection Trending Now on NYPost.com 41,765 It's time to face facts: Obama's presidency was a failure 23,630 Bob Woodward calls Trump dossier 'garbage' 22,421 Jimmy 'Superfly' Snuka dead at 73 19,108 Like clockwork, Trump rips 'Saturday Night Live' on Twitter Real Estate News Chef Michael Symon Wants to Cook Up a Sale for His NYC Townhouse Grammy-Winning Rocker Gary Clark Jr. Purchases Huge Texas Ranch Buy It Now: Amazon’s Jeff Bezos Bought the Biggest House in DC Chicago Bears Guard Kyle Long Snags Lake Forest Mansion for a Discount It’s Not in Bel Air, but Tatyana Ali’s Studio City Retreat Is Up for Rent More from Realtor.com Now On More women rip Michael Che’s dating app etiquette Katie Couric’s ready for her TV comeback Eric Schneiderman and Preet Bharara power lunch SEE ALL More Stories pagesix Photo of Justin Trudeau's mom commando at Studio 54 up for auction Now On Decider Top 10 Sexiest, Dirtiest & Steamiest Movies On Netflix Right Now nypost It's time to face facts: Obama's presidency was a failure New York Post Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Email Newsletters Mobile Apps Contact Us Tips Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Email Sections & Features News Real Estate Page Six Tech Sports Media Metro Photos Entertainment Video Business Alexa Opinion Covers Fashion Horoscopes Living Classifieds Newsletters & Feeds Email Newsletters RSS Feeds NYPost Store Home Delivery Subscribe Manage Subscription Preferences Help/Support Customer Service App FAQ & Help Contact Us Tips Newsroom Letters to the Editor Reprints Careers Apps iPhone App iPad App Android Phone Android Tablet Advertise Media Kit Contact Post Digital Network © 2017 NYP Holdings, Inc.

In the third quarter, PayPal's mobile person-to-person payments app processed $4.9 billion in transactions, up 131% from a year earlier. The app is used for splitting bills — checks, rent, grocery bills, travel expenses — and allows for sending messages with the payments. In perhaps the ultimate sign of its staying power, Venmo, like Google, has become a verb. On college campuses, the phrase "Venmo me" is synonymous with "send me cash." Should banks bother trying to catch up? Should they even want to? And if so, can they? The answer to the first two questions is yes, and look for a major effort on that front in the coming year. Big banks aren't newcomers to the mobile P-to-P space. JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America each processed about $21 billion of P-to-P payments in 2015 through their own mobile apps, according to estimates from S&P Global Market Intelligence. But the P-to-P functionality in the apps can be cumbersome for users. And the apps don't always play nice with other banks. In contrast, Venmo makes paying acquaintances easy: Simply enter the recipient's phone number or email address. Or, if you prefer, allow Venmo to pull in your phone and Facebook contacts and just search by name. Millennials also appreciate the social component: Optional feeds make it easy for users to tell friends who also use Venmo, or even the entire Venmo universe, about who's spending on what, and with whom. Money moves instantaneously between PayPal accounts, but takes several days to make it to linked bank accounts. The big banks, which have been working on their answer to Venmo through their clearXchange joint venture since 2011, get criticized for moving too slowly while a deluge of other fintech and social-media competitors piled in with offerings of their own. In 2016, the banks merged clearXchange with the bank-owned Early Warning Services and then rebranded it as Zelle, short for gazelle. The Zelle app goes live in 2017, with 19 mostly large banks signed on. It will be available to many others through their vendors, as the industry's unified P-to-P play. "We've made far more progress than we're given credit for," said Gareth Gaston, executive vice president for omnichannel at U.S. Bancorp, one of Zelle's owners. "The goal is to make this a ubiquitous product in the industry." Mobile P-to-P payments might generate more expense than revenue for banks. PayPal has struggled to make money off Venmo despite its growth. While some have tried, no one has found a palatable way to charge for the service. Those who control the space could eventually win other e-commerce and other payments business, but that remains a work in progress. Even so, as keepers of the accounts, banks have some inherent advantages when it comes to payments — and some clear reasons for wanting to control that business. "As a bank, you don't want to give your customers a reason to go somewhere else," said Zil Bareisis, a senior analyst with Celent. As the moniker suggests, speed is Zelle's biggest selling point. With Early Warning, banks' fraud- and risk-management effort, playing the role of traffic cop, the app can create the appearance that payments are being processed in real-time (even though they're actually run on banks' Automated Clearing House system). "If you have two banks with a relationship as part of Zelle, an account can be credited immediately," even if it takes a day to officially clear, Bareisis said. Bank-grade security and reliability are other potential pluses. Banks are viewed as more trustworthy than tech companies, and some social media-based P-to-P apps, such as one offered by Snapchat, have been prone to slowdowns and delays. PayPal has responded to Zelle's arrival by strengthening its ties with Visa, which also has designs on expanding into mobile payments and the network to pull it off, but Gaston said the business is ultimately banks' to lose. "The incumbent competitors are a little bit of a sideshow," he said. "We can provide customers with something nobody else can — a very integrated experience with a genuine real-time transaction." It will be difficult for Zelle to overcome Venmo's head start among millennials, Bareisis said, but there's room for more than one winner in P-to-P. Javelin Strategy & Research predicts that 126 million Americans will use mobile P-to-P payment apps by 2020, up 50% from today. "Zelle won't kill off Venmo, but there will be customer segments that appreciate Zelle's affiliation with banks," Bareisis said. "The market is big enough that they can coexist."

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A      Almost everybody loves Russia and wants to get as far away as possible from Turkey. That just about sums up investor sentiment toward the developing economies of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Money managers’ top calls for next year are centered on markets where the political climate is improving and assets are less vulnerable to external shocks arising from higher U.S. borrowing costs and President-elect Donald Trump’s policy announcements. Within politically stable markets, investors are looking for cheaper valuations and an ability to pace a rally in commodity prices. Currencies UBS Group AG says Russia’s ruble will offer the best-carry trade opportunity in EMEA over the next 12 months, with a potential return of 26 percent. Relatively high interest rates and recovering oil prices will drive the currency’s appreciation, the Zurich-based investment bank says. JPMorgan Chase & Co. expects the Czech koruna to be resilient to global risk and outperform its peers due to support from a strong balance of payments. Morgan Stanley bets on a rebound in eastern European currencies, especially Poland’s zloty, if political risks in Europe don’t deepen. Most people warned against buying Turkish assets. James Lord, a market strategist at Morgan Stanley, is sticking to his bearish view of the lira, even though it appears to be cheap. He says the lack of focus on productivity growth as wages rise will continue to undermine the currency’s competitiveness. Stocks NN Investment Partners sees the Russian equity market as an “obvious candidate.” Higher oil prices, a stronger ruble and easing inflation should encourage the country’s central bank to loosen monetary policy, said Nathan Griffiths, who helps manage about $750 million. Griffiths also expects the FTSE/JSE All Share Index in Johannesburg to rally, benefiting from curbs on President Jacob Zuma’s power. Aviva Investors considers small-cap companies in developing markets attractive, especially in retail, health and industrials. Ian Pizer, the London-based head of investment strategy and co-fund manager at Aviva, says heavy domestic ownership gives those companies a buffer. Capital Economics Ltd. says banks in central and eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa are improving their financial ratios, though lenders in Russia and Turkey are still in the doldrums. Bonds Deutsche Bank AG expects growing stability in domestic politics to benefit Russian and South African bonds. Russia should gain from an improving relationship with the U.S., while South Africa will probably avoid a debt downgrade, the German lender says. Denmark-based Global Evolution Fonds A/S favors Egypt’s local bonds, after yields rose to almost 20 percent and the currency’s value halved following its free float. Global Evolution recommends Nigeria to investors who can make a “leap of faith” as he expects political stability to improve next year and the government to make a second attempt to float its currency. Ghana’s peaceful transfer of power after its 2016 presidential election, and increased oil production make its local-currency notes and Eurobonds attractive, says Stephen Bailey-Smith, who helps manage $4.2 billion at Global Evolution. Neuberger Berman Europe Ltd. says Turkey’s foreign-currency bonds are cheap as it deems domestic risks to be fully priced in. © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

Photo Credit: Dan Dalton/Getty Images The best cash back credit cards offer generous rewards and sign-up bonuses. But the card that's best for you depends on your spending habits and financial situation. Choosing the right card can mean hundreds or thousands of dollars back on your purchases annually. Some cash back cards offer a flat-rate percentage on purchases, while other cards come with bonuses on specific categories and a flat-rate percentage on general purchases. CreditCards.com recently rounded up the best cash back credit cards for its 2016 cash back card competition, which were then rated by a panel of judges to narrow down the top 3. CARD SEARCH: Compare cash back credit cards. Notably, the judges declared a tie for the 2nd place card in this category. <!-- iframe --> Here are the 3 best cash back credit cards, according to CreditCards.com: 1. Citi® Double Cash Credit Card The Citi® Double Cash Credit Card earns 1st place in the competition for its generous 1% cash-back on everyday purchases and 1% when you pay your credit card bill on time. It has a simple rewards structure with no categories to track, no cap on cash back and no annual fee. Highlights: The Citi® Double Cash credit card offers a chance to earn cash back twice: 1% cash back on general purchases and an additional 1% when you pay your bill on time. With that 1% plus 1% cash-back structure, this is an industry-leading card for cash back on general purchases. There's no annual fee on the Citi® Double Cash card, making it cheaper than competing cards, such as the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express. In addition to generous cash back, the Citi® Double Cash credit card has perks including purchase protection, and trip cancellation and interruption protection. This card comes with a 0% APR on balance transfers for 18 months. That makes it a good option for those interested in consolidating and paying down debt. Citi® Double Cash cardholders may also benefit from the Citi Price Rewind program. If you register your purchases online, the company will search for lower prices on those items and refund you the difference on better deals. Fees and APR: There's no annual fee with the Citi® Double Cash credit card. This card comes with a variable APR between 13.24% and 23.24%. Notes: The Citi® Double Cash credit card is best for those who would like an affordable everyday cash back card with generous rewards on all purchases and an easy-to-use rewards structure. Perhaps the best feature of the Citi® Double Cash card, aside from the chance to earn cash back twice, is its simplicity. There's no chasing bonus categories, no rotating categories and no annual fee. Disadvantages: Carrying a balance can eat up rewards with the Citi® Double Cash card. And this card requires you to pay on time monthly in order to earn an additional 1% cash back. If you typically carry a balance, or often fail to pay on time, this may not be the card for you. There's also no sign-up bonus, something you'll find on other competing cards. 2. Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express The Blue Cash Preferred® card tied for 2nd place with the Chase Freedom Unlimited card. Very generous rewards – 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets and 3% cash back on gas stations and select department stores – make the Blue Cash Preferred® a top competitor in the cash back category. Highlights: The Blue Cash Preferred® offers 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets up to $6,000 per year. It also comes with 3% cash back at U.S. gas stations and select department stores. On general purchase, this card pays 1%, filling in gaps between its bonus categories. For the 1st 6 months, the Blue Cash Preferred® card pays 5% cash-back on eligible travel purchases up to $200. This card offers a $150 statement credit after spending $1,000 on the card within the 1st 3 months of opening an account. Other perks with the Blue Cash Preferred® include a cash back tracker, purchase protection, return protection and roadside assistance. Fees: The Blue Cash Preferred® credit card has an APR between 13.24% and 23.24%, comparable to the other 2 cards on this list. This card has a $95 annual fee, which is on the high side. But the generous rewards program, when used properly, can offset that fee. Notes: The Blue Cash Preferred® credit card is best for those who spend big on groceries, gas and department stores. If you're looking for a card that rewards for more general spending habits, another cash back card may be more beneficial. In addition to its sign-up bonus and rewards, this card offers 0% APR on purchases and balance transfers for 12 months. That makes it a good option for anyone interested in financing a big purchase or consolidating and paying down debt. Disadvantages: The $6,000 annual spending cap on groceries means the most you could earn is $360 at 6% before the relatively low 1% rate kicks in. In addition, American Express isn't as widely used as Visa, MasterCard and Discover. That might make it necessary to keep a backup card or to use this card strategically with others. 3. Chase Freedom Unlimited Card The Chase Freedom Unlimited card tied for 2nd place with the Blue Cash Preferred® credit card for its low-maintenance rewards and 1.5% cash back on every purchase. It's ideal for the busy cardholder who doesn't have time to worry about spending on bonus categories. Highlights: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card pays 1.5% cash back on all purchases. While that isn't as generous as competing cards, its simplicity and reliable rewards system makes up for the lower rate. This card offers a $150 statement credit for spending $500 within the 1st 3 months of opening an account. The Chase Freedom Unlimited card allows you to redeem for cash anytime at any amount. Cash back rewards don’t expire as long as the card stays open. This card offers a 15-month 0% APR period on purchases and balance transfers, making it a good card for those looking to finance a large purchase or pay off debt. Car rental insurance, roadside assistance, price protection and extended warranties are included with this card. Fees: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card comes with a variable APR between 14.24% and 23.24%, on par with competing cards. There's no annual fee with this card, making it a more affordable option than the Blue Cash Preferred® credit card from American Express, but on the same fee level as the Citi® Double Cash credit card. Notes: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card is best for those who want an easy-to-use everyday cash back card with rewards for all purchases. Those who sign up for the Chase Freedom Unlimited will enjoy its flat 1.5% cash back on all purchases, easy redemption, large sign-up bonus and 15-month 0% APR period. Disadvantages: While this card can boost your rewards across the board, it isn't ideal if you do a lot of spending in one particular area. For example, if you spend a lot on groceries, the Blue Cash Preferred® card might be a better option. This card also comes with a lower flat rate (1.5%) than other cards in its class. The Citi® Double Cash card offers a higher 1% cash-back on all purchases and an additional 1% cash-back for paying your bill on time. Compare Cash Back Cards The bottom line The best cash back credit cards offer generous rewards and easy redemption options, but the card that's ideal for you depends on your spending habits. If you're looking to maximize your rewards across the board, a flat-rate cash back card is your best bet. Likewise, if you spend a lot in certain areas, look for a card with a high cash back rate on particular bonus categories. The Best Cash Back Credit Cards Cash back credit card Rate Cash back reward Citi® Double Cash card 13.24% to 23.24% variable Up to 2% cash back on all purchases Blue Cash Preferred® card 13.24% to 23.24% 6% cash back on groceries, 3% on gas and select department stores Chase Freedom Unlimited 14.24% to 23.24% 1.5% cash back on all purchases Related posts: Best rewards credit cards – Top Picks for 2016 Best Chase credit cards: Top picks for 2016 Best business credit cards: Top 3 picks for 2016 The best balance transfer credit cards Best Visa credit card: Top picks for 2016 « Credit card rates for Thursday, September 29 Best credit card rates for Tuesday, October 4 » Bankrate wants to hear from you and encourages comments.

But like many foreign investors, he’s banking on an economic turnaround in 2017. Russian car sales, once growing around 50 per cent a year, dropped off a cliff in 2015 after the rouble’s 2014 collapse and fell a further 10 per cent in 2016. Miroshnikov remains cautious, saying the next few months will be tough and seeing the possibility of “a recovery only in the second half of 2017”. However, he told Reuters he expects sales will at least stop falling over the year as a whole. Foreign investors are more enthusiastic in hoping for a revival in economic growth and consumer demand after two years of recession. Even after roughly 50 per cent gains on Russian stocks and rouble bonds in 2016, analysts and fund managers interviewed for this article remain almost unanimously bullish on the country. Russia figures among the top 2017 trades for Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, UBS, JPMorgan, Rabobank and Bank of America Merrill Lynch among others, with Goldman predicting it “to move from a recovery to a growth phase”. On the face of it, the stars do seem aligned for Russia. Data showed manufacturing expanding in December at its fastest pace since March 2011, a signal that the economy is starting to grow again. Prices for oil, its lifeblood, will average $57 (Dh209) a barrel, according to analysts’ forecasts in Reuters polls, $10 higher than in 2016. And if the central bank brings inflation down to its 4 per cent target, ordinary Russians should have more money to spend. Two other factors have added impetus to the trade. First, Republican Donald Trump won US elections on November 8 with a promise to improve ties with Russia, holding out the possibility of easing sanctions imposed after Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. And on December 7, Glencore and Qatar teamed up to pay $11 billion for a stake in state oil firm Rosneft, confirming Russia’s allure for international investors. Some are confident that the sanctions, tightened over Russia’s role in a separatist rebellion in eastern Ukraine, will go after the new US administration takes over. “I like Russia for some very simple reasons: The most obvious reason is Trump, because sanctions will be lifted,” Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management, said. “But it is a little more complicated than that. It is one of the few emerging markets where we feel it is cyclical...where we think there is some decent potential in almost every scenario.” Hopes related to sanctions got a setback this week as Washington imposed fresh curbs on Russian intelligence agencies over the hacking of political groups during the US election campaign. But many reckon Trump will roll back the measures once he takes office in January. President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Moscow would not expel anyone in retaliation, adding that he would wait for the actions of Trump before deciding on any further steps in relations with the United States. Take the politics out, and Russia looks attractive relative to many big emerging market (EM) economies. Unlike countries such as Mexico or Turkey, it has a balance of payments surplus, making it less vulnerable to the rise in global borrowing costs. Russia is favoured by bond investors too because falling inflation may bring 150-200 basis points in official interest rate cuts next year. That will keep inflation-adjusted bond yields at among the highest in the world. “There is a lot more acceptance now that Russia is in a good place,” said Yerlan Syzdykov, head of emerging debt at Pioneer Investments. Syzdykov holds more Russian bonds than their weight in emerging market indexes, but Pioneer is also bullish on Moscow-listed stocks, he said, adding that the fund was looking to “put more money into cyclical recovery stories”. Corporate results have been encouraging. Earnings-per-share, a key profitability indicator, recently surpassed their 10-year average for the first time since 2012. http://bit.ly/2h1r1zG In recent months analysts have revised up their estimates of Russian companies’ earnings at a faster pace than the rise in oil prices, Thomson Reuters Datastream shows. http://bit.ly/2hTe3pw COSTS But some are sceptical. VTB Capital analyst Maria Kolbina, for instance, says Russians’ real incomes will need to grow by 5-7 per cent annually for a couple of years for consumer demand to recover significantly. Russia also scores poorly on all measures of corruption and transparency; its fortunes remain tied to oil exports and a recent report by the anti-monopoly service found state ownership of the economy had doubled since 2005 to 70 per cent. But Pictet’s Paolini says asset prices reflect these concerns. Russia has historically traded at a discount to other emerging markets and even after the 2016 gains, shares’ ratio to forward earnings is half the emerging markets average. “Russia’s PE is still very low, I would be worried if you had a strong performance and very expensive valuations. But that is not the case, Russia’s PE is 6, Brazil is 14,” Paolini said. Many also see positive structural changes afoot. “When people say nothing is changing, they think of corruption and, true, there doesn’t seem to be much change on that front. But the move to inflation targeting and a floating currency is a huge structural change,” said David Hauner, head of EEMEA cross-asset strategy and economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML). Hauner advised clients last year to load up on rouble bonds, a bet which paid off handsomely. He predicts at least 10 per cent returns next year, against zero from emerging debt overall. BAML is also overweight Russian equities and Hauner said hefty dividend payouts and falling inflation were not yet reflected in share prices. “The PE gap relative to EM has not improved at all, even though Russia has fundamentally improved,” he said. “The only negative thing to say about Russia is that everyone likes it, so if something goes wrong it could be quite painful.” More from Markets WFES: Clean energy model to be showcased Assurance on oil to keep prices supported Nogaholding approaches banks for debut bond Marginal fall in Dubai index BlackRock sees record flows into low-cost ETFs India reduces brokers’ fee by 25 per cent Minimum investment requirement is $30,000 Egypt targets $2-2.5b Eurobond issue filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsMarkets FOLLOW US Stock Look Up Search Latest share prices Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01WFES: Clean energy model to be showcased 02Goldman Sachs forecasts 13% rally in Mexico Peso 03Marginal fall in Dubai index Play How to protect your device from hackers May 26, 2016 Play Rides, thrills and treats at Global Village Feb 10, 2011 Play Dubai Shopping Festival 2011 opens Jan 21, 2011 Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 9Images In pictures: World Economic Forum 2010 Jan 28, 2010 8Images World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi Jan 18, 2010 7Images Keeping Burj Khalifa sparkling Dec 29, 2009 1Image Preparations underway for WEF in Davos Jan 22, 2013 Markets International Commodity Prices Error - No Data As on 2017-01-16 04:50:14 Most Popular on Gulf News 9 ways your own home could kill you Manholes being used as warehouses found Sharjah opens new Dh400 million jail Businessman donates Dh370m to charity How to rent a car by the minute in Dubai ‘Diplomat’ denies kidnap, Dh2m theft Revealed: World's most powerful passports Bahrain executes 3 for killing police officers Palestinian state only solution: Paris meeting Close Recommended For You 9 ways your own home could kill youPUBLISHED ON Jan 11, 2017 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

But like many foreign investors, he's banking on an economic turnaround in 2017. Russian car sales, once growing around 50 percent a year, dropped off a cliff in 2015 after the rouble's 2014 collapse and fell a further 10 percent in 2016. Miroshnikov remains cautious, saying the next few months will be tough and seeing the possibility of "a recovery only in the second half of 2017". However, he told Reuters he expects sales will at least stop falling over the year as a whole. Foreign investors are more enthusiastic in hoping for a revival in economic growth and consumer demand after two years of recession. Even after roughly 50 percent gains on Russian stocks and rouble bonds in 2016, analysts and fund managers interviewed for this article remain almost unanimously bullish on the country. Russia figures among the top 2017 trades for Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, UBS, JPMorgan, Rabobank and Bank of America Merrill Lynch among others, with Goldman predicting it "to move from a recovery to a growth phase". On the face of it, the stars do seem aligned for Russia. Data showed manufacturing expanding in December at its fastest pace since March 2011, a signal that the economy is starting to grow again. Prices for oil, its lifeblood, will average $57 a barrel, according to analysts' forecasts in Reuters polls, $10 higher than in 2016. And if the central bank brings inflation down to its 4 percent target, ordinary Russians should have more money to spend. Two other factors have added impetus to the trade. First, Republican Donald Trump won U.S. elections on Nov. 8 with a promise to improve ties with Russia, holding out the possibility of easing sanctions imposed after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. And on Dec. 7, Glencore and Qatar teamed up to pay $11 billion for a stake in state oil firm Rosneft, confirming Russia's allure for international investors. Some are confident that the sanctions, tightened over Russia's role in a separatist rebellion in eastern Ukraine, will go after the new U.S. administration takes over. "I like Russia for some very simple reasons: The most obvious reason is Trump, because sanctions will be lifted," Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management, said. "But it is a little more complicated than that. It is one of the few emerging markets where we feel it is cyclical...where we think there is some decent potential in almost every scenario." Hopes related to sanctions got a setback this week as Washington imposed fresh curbs on Russian intelligence agencies over the hacking of political groups during the U.S. election campaign. But many reckon Trump will roll back the measures once he takes office in January. President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Moscow would not expel anyone in retaliation, adding that he would wait for the actions of Trump before deciding on any further steps in relations with the United States. Take the politics out, and Russia looks attractive relative to many big emerging market (EM) economies. Unlike countries such as Mexico or Turkey, it has a balance of payments surplus, making it less vulnerable to the rise in global borrowing costs. Russia is favoured by bond investors too because falling inflation may bring 150-200 basis points in official interest rate cuts next year. That will keep inflation-adjusted bond yields at among the highest in the world. "There is a lot more acceptance now that Russia is in a good place," said Yerlan Syzdykov, head of emerging debt at Pioneer Investments. Syzdykov holds more Russian bonds than their weight in emerging market indexes, but Pioneer is also bullish on Moscow-listed stocks, he said, adding that the fund was looking to "put more money into cyclical recovery stories". Corporate results have been encouraging. Earnings-per-share, a key profitability indicator, recently surpassed their 10-year average for the first time since 2012. bit.ly/2h1r1zG In recent months analysts have revised up their estimates of Russian companies' earnings at a faster pace than the rise in oil prices, Thomson Reuters Datastream shows. bit.ly/2hTe3pw COSTS But some are sceptical. VTB Capital analyst Maria Kolbina, for instance, says Russians' real incomes will need to grow by 5-7 percent annually for a couple of years for consumer demand to recover significantly. Russia also scores poorly on all measures of corruption and transparency; its fortunes remain tied to oil exports and a recent report by the anti-monopoly service found state ownership of the economy had doubled since 2005 to 70 percent. But Pictet's Paolini says asset prices reflect these concerns. Russia has historically traded at a discount to other emerging markets and even after the 2016 gains, shares' ratio to forward earnings is half the emerging markets average. "Russia's PE is still very low, I would be worried if you had a strong performance and very expensive valuations. But that is not the case, Russia's PE is 6, Brazil is 14," Paolini said. Many also see positive structural changes afoot. "When people say nothing is changing, they think of corruption and, true, there doesn't seem to be much change on that front. But the move to inflation targeting and a floating currency is a huge structural change," said David Hauner, head of EEMEA cross-asset strategy and economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML). Hauner advised clients last year to load up on rouble bonds, a bet which paid off handsomely. He predicts at least 10 percent returns next year, against zero from emerging debt overall. BAML is also overweight Russian equities and Hauner said hefty dividend payouts and falling inflation were not yet reflected in share prices. "The PE gap relative to EM has not improved at all, even though Russia has fundamentally improved," he said. "The only negative thing to say about Russia is that everyone likes it, so if something goes wrong it could be quite painful."

But like many foreign investors, he's banking on an economic turnaround in 2017. Russian car sales, once growing around 50 percent a year, dropped off a cliff in 2015 after the rouble's 2014 collapse and fell a further 10 percent in 2016. Miroshnikov remains cautious, saying the next few months will be tough and seeing the possibility of "a recovery only in the second half of 2017". However, he told Reuters he expects sales will at least stop falling over the year as a whole. Foreign investors are more enthusiastic in hoping for a revival in economic growth and consumer demand after two years of recession. Even after roughly 50 percent gains on Russian stocks and rouble bonds in 2016, analysts and fund managers interviewed for this article remain almost unanimously bullish on the country. Russia figures among the top 2017 trades for Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, UBS, JPMorgan, Rabobank and Bank of America Merrill Lynch among others, with Goldman predicting it "to move from a recovery to a growth phase". On the face of it, the stars do seem aligned for Russia. Data showed manufacturing expanding in December at its fastest pace since March 2011, a signal that the economy is starting to grow again. Prices for oil, its lifeblood, will average $57 a barrel, according to analysts' forecasts in Reuters polls, $10 higher than in 2016. And if the central bank brings inflation down to its 4 percent target, ordinary Russians should have more money to spend. Two other factors have added impetus to the trade. First, Republican Donald Trump won U.S. elections on Nov. 8 with a promise to improve ties with Russia, holding out the possibility of easing sanctions imposed after Moscow's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. And on Dec. 7, Glencore and Qatar teamed up to pay $11 billion for a stake in state oil firm Rosneft, confirming Russia's allure for international investors. Some are confident that the sanctions, tightened over Russia's role in a separatist rebellion in eastern Ukraine, will go after the new U.S. administration takes over. "I like Russia for some very simple reasons: The most obvious reason is Trump, because sanctions will be lifted," Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management, said. "But it is a little more complicated than that. It is one of the few emerging markets where we feel it is cyclical...where we think there is some decent potential in almost every scenario." Hopes related to sanctions got a setback this week as Washington imposed fresh curbs on Russian intelligence agencies over the hacking of political groups during the U.S. election campaign. But many reckon Trump will roll back the measures once he takes office in January. President Vladimir Putin said on Friday that Moscow would not expel anyone in retaliation, adding that he would wait for the actions of Trump before deciding on any further steps in relations with the United States. Take the politics out, and Russia looks attractive relative to many big emerging market (EM) economies. Unlike countries such as Mexico or Turkey, it has a balance of payments surplus, making it less vulnerable to the rise in global borrowing costs. Russia is favoured by bond investors too because falling inflation may bring 150-200 basis points in official interest rate cuts next year. That will keep inflation-adjusted bond yields at among the highest in the world. "There is a lot more acceptance now that Russia is in a good place," said Yerlan Syzdykov, head of emerging debt at Pioneer Investments. Syzdykov holds more Russian bonds than their weight in emerging market indexes, but Pioneer is also bullish on Moscow-listed stocks, he said, adding that the fund was looking to "put more money into cyclical recovery stories". Corporate results have been encouraging. Earnings-per-share, a key profitability indicator, recently surpassed their 10-year average for the first time since 2012. bit.ly/2h1r1zG In recent months analysts have revised up their estimates of Russian companies' earnings at a faster pace than the rise in oil prices, Thomson Reuters Datastream shows. bit.ly/2hTe3pw COSTS But some are sceptical. VTB Capital analyst Maria Kolbina, for instance, says Russians' real incomes will need to grow by 5-7 percent annually for a couple of years for consumer demand to recover significantly. Russia also scores poorly on all measures of corruption and transparency; its fortunes remain tied to oil exports and a recent report by the anti-monopoly service found state ownership of the economy had doubled since 2005 to 70 percent. But Pictet's Paolini says asset prices reflect these concerns. Russia has historically traded at a discount to other emerging markets and even after the 2016 gains, shares' ratio to forward earnings is half the emerging markets average. "Russia's PE is still very low, I would be worried if you had a strong performance and very expensive valuations. But that is not the case, Russia's PE is 6, Brazil is 14," Paolini said. Many also see positive structural changes afoot. "When people say nothing is changing, they think of corruption and, true, there doesn't seem to be much change on that front. But the move to inflation targeting and a floating currency is a huge structural change," said David Hauner, head of EEMEA cross-asset strategy and economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML). Hauner advised clients last year to load up on rouble bonds, a bet which paid off handsomely. He predicts at least 10 percent returns next year, against zero from emerging debt overall. BAML is also overweight Russian equities and Hauner said hefty dividend payouts and falling inflation were not yet reflected in share prices. "The PE gap relative to EM has not improved at all, even though Russia has fundamentally improved," he said. "The only negative thing to say about Russia is that everyone likes it, so if something goes wrong it could be quite painful."

Join FitC and make 600 friends Jan 13 Inflation means higher wages and prices, lower stock and bond returns Jan 13 Philadelphia Magazine announces layoffs, shuts down popular Eagles section of website Jan 12 More from Erin Arvedlund Arrow icon Our tax rates may change significantly in the next year or two, given the Republican sweep of the presidency and both houses of Congress. President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans agree they want lower rates and a broader taxable-income base. But they disagree on finer points, and have yet to flesh out important details. The minority Democrats in the House and Senate may be able to stall and even undo tax legislation. Republicans may end up compromising or passing tax reform via the reconciliation process. So let's examine some of Trump's proposed tax cuts and Congress's proposed alternatives, with the help of J.P. Morgan's Advice Lab and J.P. Morgan Private Bank in Philadelphia. Ordinary income. Trump's campaign plan calls for reducing the number of tax brackets to three, from seven. The maximum tax rate would be 33 percent for single filers earning more than $112,500 and married couples filing jointly earning more than $225,000. The House Republican leadership plan? Same maximum rate of 33 percent but at higher incomes (over $190,150 for single filers, over $231,450 for married couples filing jointly). Long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income. Currently, the maximum rate for both is 20 percent. Trump's plan calls for the maximum long-term capital-gains rate to remain at 20 percent, applicable to single filers earning more than $112,500 and married couples filing jointly earning more than $225,000.  Qualified dividend-income rates are expected to remain the same as long-term capital-gains rates. The House Republican leadership wants 50 percent of capital gains, interest income, and dividends. The Republican plan makes no distinction between qualified or ordinary, and the other 50 percent would be taxed at the three proposed ordinary income-rate brackets. Both Trump's and Congress' proposed maximum effective rate for long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income would be 16.5 percent. Medicare surtax and AMT. Trump and House Republicans want to eliminate the Medicare surtax of 3.8 percent and the Alternative Minimum Tax. Carried interest would be taxed as ordinary income. Deductions for itemized expenses. Here's where it gets interesting, says Julia Fisher, wealth adviser for J.P. Morgan in Center City. Currently, Americans can take hefty tax deductions to reduce income using a panoply of expenses, including charitable gifts, state and local income and property taxes, and mortgage interest. Trump's plan is controversial, capping deductibility of all itemized expenses at $100,000 for single filers and $200,000 for married couples filing jointly -- even gifts to charity. The House GOP plan would eliminate deductibility for all itemized expenses with two exceptions, charitable gifts and mortgage interest paid. "Today, you can give to charity and the charity keeps 100 cents of every dollar. Trump's plan would deduct 20 percent of whatever amount the charity gets. It's a real departure." Applied literally to, for example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, "it would have a huge negative impact on their foundation and even someone's smaller foundation." Added Fisher: "The proposed restriction on gifts to private charities at death could conceivably have a further tax impact." Both Trump's and Congress' proposals are silent on donor-advised funds, which rankles Eileen Heisman, president and CEO of the National Philanthropic Trust. Jenkintown-based NPT helps clients set up and distribute money from donor-advised funds. Trump's campaign plan also would eliminate the estate tax, to be replaced by realized capital gains in excess of $10 million, the step-up in basis for large estates and deductions for transfers to “private charity” at death.  The Trump campaign plan mentions “private charity,” but the term is undefined. Presumably, it would include private foundations, but it is not clear whether it also would include donor-advised funds. "Donor-advised funds are public, not private," Heisman said. She's upset about the cap on charitable deductions. "We as a nation are a country of givers, and 90 percent of people who make $1 million or more are active in charitable giving. We're a country of giving money to charity, and that builds community. It doesn't make any sense," she said. Investment implications. Tracy Maeter, global investment specialist for J.P. Morgan Private Bank, said clients are waiting until 2017 to realize their capital market gains, "when tax rates may be lower, and also because the market is so-well supported." As for chatter that Wall Street may take profits into the inauguration? "You will have some selling pressure in the new year 2017. That might be an opportunity to start averaging into" equities, she said. Valuations on U.S. stocks "are not cheap, but at the same time we're seeing global growth heading into 3 percent levels, and that can drive earnings growth of around 10 percent." It wouldn't be a surprise to see "mid-single digit or even high single-digit returns in the U.S. stock market -- and that doesn't require everything to happen, such as tax reform and infrastructure spending," under the new administration. The Treasury market, on the other hand, is repricing.  And for inflation hedges, Maeter said, "at this point the best inflation protection is in equities. We also like floating-rate exposure, such as floating-rate notes and bank loans. We've had one move from the [Federal Reserve], and we see two more in 2017 of 0.25 percent each."

(NYSE:CHT) from a sell rating to a hold rating in a research note published on Tuesday morning. According to Zacks, “Chunghwa seems to dominate the Taiwanese telecom market with its presence in 80% of the broadband market and 35% of the wireless market. The company aims to raise its presence in the 4G market in Taiwan to 40% in 2016. Chunghwa is expanding its fiber-based high-speed next-generation FTTx (fiber to the home/building) offerings. The company is building fiber-to-the-home and fiber-to-the-building access infrastructure. We beleive these efforts have helped the company outshine the Zacks classified Diversified Comm Services industry on a year-to-date basis. However, Chunghwa unveiled a disappointing guidance for certain important metrics for full-year 2016. Moreover, stringent pricing pressure along with an oversaturated and competitive telecom market and telecom regulatory changes are the near-term risks for Chunghwa.” Separately, Citigroup Inc. downgraded Chunghwa Telecom Co. from a neutral rating to a sell rating in a research note on Thursday, December 8th. Chunghwa Telecom Co. (NYSE:CHT) opened at 31.55 on Tuesday. The company’s 50-day moving average price is $32.65 and its 200-day moving average price is $34.99. The firm has a market cap of $24.47 billion, a price-to-earnings ratio of 19.36 and a beta of 0.29. Chunghwa Telecom Co. has a 52-week low of $29.31 and a 52-week high of $38.47.

You can get our headlines via email as well, or follow us on Twitter. Although home prices have been rising steadily over the past year, house flipping is still extremely popular among investors. And it’s the banks that are being credited with helping investors jump back into the flipping game. Numerous banks are providing investors with flexible financing vehicles for flipping properties, the Wall Street Journal reports. Larger banks like Wells Fargo & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., for example, have begun extending credit lines to firms that specialize in lending to home flippers. J.P. Morgan reportedly is lending an estimated $60 million to 5 Arch Funding, a company that offers financing to home flippers in Irvine, Calif. “The floodgates have opened,” said Eduardo Axtle of Oakland, Calif., an investor who has taken out around 50 home loans over the past five years. In the first nine months of 2016, the number of investors who flipped a house reached the highest level since 2007. Further, about a third of the deals in the third quarter were financed. Private lenders reportedly are even, in some cases, offering debt in excess of the value of the home (also known as a high loan-to-value ratio). Lenders reportedly also are loosening up their documentation rules. They may still require bank statements to get a loan but not a W-2 tax earnings statement. What’s more, home flippers are finding greater financing opportunities through online lenders, such as LendingHome Corp. and Asset Avenue Inc., or crowdfunding websites, such as Groundfloor Finance Inc.

Skip to content Military Technologies pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 2 January 20172 January 2017 by Military News Pure Multi-Family REIT LP (PMULF: OTCQX International) | Pure Multi-Family REIT LP Announces US$40 Million Property Acquisition in Dallas, Texas VANCOUVER, BC–(Marketwired – December 28, 2016) – Pure Multi-Family REIT LP („Pure Multi-Family”) (TSX VENTURE: RUF.U) (TSX VENTURE: RUF.UN) (TSX VENTURE: RUF.DB.U) (OTCQX: PMULF) announced today that it has entered into an agreement to acquire (the „Acquisition”) a multi-family apartment community (the „Property”), located in the Allen sub-market of Dallas, Texas, for a purchase price of US$40,000,000. The Property was constructed in 2002 and consists of 288 residential units averaging 961 square feet. Pure Multi-Family intends to fund the Acquisition with proceeds from the previously announced profitable sale of Fairways at Prestonwood (a 1991 built asset that sold on November 17, 2016) and new first mortgage financing in the amount of approximately US$16,500,000. The first mortgage financing is expected to bear a fixed interest rate of 3.27% per annum for a term of 5 years. The purchase price for this fully stabilized asset represents a going-in capitalization rate of 5.3%. Steve Evans, Pure Multi-Family’s CEO, stated, „The Property is located in the highly desirable residential area of Allen, Texas, which is in close proximity for two high-profile master-planned employment hubs in Northern Dallas: Legacy West and CityLine. Legacy West is located ten miles west of the property and will be home to Toyota, JPMorgan Chase, Liberty Mutual and FedEx, while CityLine is home to State Farm and Raytheon and is less than eight miles south of the property. Further, the property improves our average portfolio age and provides solid in-place cash flow with potential to execute our asset improvement strategy to increase unitholder value.” The Acquisition is expected to close in late January, 2017. Upon the completion of this acquisition and the previously announced acquisition of the Lenox Creekside, Pure Multi-Family’s portfolio will consist of 17 multi-family properties comprising an aggregate of 5,793 residential units, situated on 310 acres of land. About Pure Multi-Family REIT LP Pure Multi-Family is a Canadian based, publically traded vehicle which offers investors exclusive exposure to attractive, institutional quality U.S. multi-family real estate assets.

Clayton is a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell who specializes in public and private mergers and offerings, an area that requires expertise on complex securities regulations and corporate governance. Clayton was not available to comment. He met with President-elect Donald Trump on Dec. 22 and appears to have overtaken a former U.S. Attorney, Debra Wong Yang, whose name had been floated as a top candidate in early December. Yang declined to comment. Clayton's name surfaced relatively recently and he is one of a handful of other top contenders. Besides Yang, other names mentioned include former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins, lawyer Ralph Ferrara, and at least one candidate who used to work at a prominent Wall Street hedge fund, but whose name could not be learned. Activist investor Carl Icahn, who has been tapped by Republican Trump to play a bigger role in his administration, has been interviewing many of the of the potential SEC candidates. During the height of the 2008 financial crisis, Clayton worked on major deals involving big banks, including Barclays Capital's acquisition of Lehman Brothers' assets, the sale of Bear Stearns to JP Morgan Chase, and the U.S. Treasury Department's capital investment in Goldman Sachs , according to his law firm's web site. The position of SEC chair will be very important to Wall Street investors and executives at Fortune 500 companies at a time when Trump has promised to roll back regulation in a variety of areas. Current SEC Chair Mary Jo White is slated to depart at the end of the Obama administration. Trump is to be sworn in as president on Jan. 20. Under White, a former federal prosecutor, the SEC's focus on enforcement increased. While some of the cases have involved big firms, the SEC has also sought to crack down on relatively minor violations, in the hopes it will deter bigger problems down the road. Some investors have said they would like to see the chair be an expert not only in enforcement matters, but have a greater understanding of markets and trading issues as U.S. firms face greater competition for global capital.

Think again, a recent investigation by U.S. financial media company Bloomberg L.P. has found. While Verizon could use the breach – the largest in recorded history, one that broke Yahoo’s personal record of 500 million account leaks, which the company set in September – to reduce Yahoo’s purchase price by up to 10 per cent, investors and the public have become too inured to the constant drumbeat of cyberattacks for the breaches to permanently destroy Yahoo’s brand, according to the Dec. 27 article. “I tend to not feel like these hacks are that big of a deal in the broader scheme of things,” Michael Mahoney, senior managing director at investment firm Falcon Point Capital, told Bloomberg. “Obviously they can be damaging, but it doesn’t take too long before people forget about it.” According to the San Diego, Calif.-based Identity Theft Resource Center, nearly 1,000 data breaches, including Yahoo’s, occurred in the U.S. in 2016, exposing more than 35 million personal records, including social security and passport numbers, and medical and banking data. And as Bloomberg reporter Olga Kharif notes, Yahoo itself is only the latest in a long line of high-profile victims, which in recent years have included Sony Corp., Target Corp., Home Depot Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., EBay Inc., and Toronto-based dating website Ashley Madison. Since Target was attacked in 2013, affecting up to 70 million customers, public opinion of data breaches has shifted, Identity Theft Resource Center CEO Eva Casey Velasquez told Bloomberg. “People know what a data breach is,” she said. “But because it did become so ubiquitous in our conversation, there’s a little bit of apathy.” Nor do stolen names and account information have the impact you might think, Bloomberg’s Kharif wrote, noting that Target and Home Depot lost around $200 million each once insurance was taken into account – a paltry amount for companies of their size. Falcon Point Capital’s Mahoney told Bloomberg that while Verizon is likely to use the breaches to reduce Yahoo’s purchase price by up to 10 percent, the company’s brand remains a powerful one, and neither breach affects the key reason Verizon wanted to buy Yahoo in the first place: its digital media assets such as Yahoo Finance, which collectively draw some 43 million daily readers, making it the world’s sixth most-popular online property, according to Alexa Internet. While Yahoo’s shares have gone down by 5.5 per cent since mid-December, when the company announced its second breach, those assets – and their accompanying traffic – remain a valuable asset for Verizon. Yahoo representatives told Bloomberg they remain confident in the company’s value and have continued to pursue integration with Verizon, while a Verizon spokesperson said the company will continue to evaluate the situation before making any final decisions.

All rights reserved Terms of use Privacy Sitemap The Intercept_ Unofficial _Sources f t ✉ ⎕ 93 Photo: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images Treasury Nominee Steve Mnuchin’s Bank Accused of “Widespread Misconduct” in Leaked Memo David Dayen David Dayen 2017-01-03T20:22:56+00:00 Photo: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images OneWest Bank, which Donald Trump’s nominee for treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, ran from 2009 to 2015, repeatedly broke California’s foreclosure laws during that period, according to a previously undisclosed 2013 memo from top prosecutors in the state attorney general’s office. The memo obtained by The Intercept alleges that OneWest rushed delinquent homeowners out of their homes by violating notice and waiting period statutes, illegally backdated key documents, and effectively gamed foreclosure auctions. In the memo, the leaders of the state attorney general’s Consumer Law Section said they had “uncovered evidence suggestive of widespread misconduct” in a yearlong investigation. In a detailed 22-page request, they identified over a thousand legal violations in the small subsection of OneWest loans they were able to examine, and they recommended that Attorney General Kamala Harris file a civil enforcement action against the Pasadena-based bank. They even wrote up a sample legal complaint, seeking injunctive relief and millions of dollars in penalties. But Harris’s office, without any explanation, declined to prosecute the case. Mnuchin, the former CEO of OneWest, was already facing challenges in his upcoming Senate confirmation hearings on account of his bank’s ruthless foreclosure practices, ranging from locking out one homeowner during a Minneapolis blizzard to foreclosing on another over a 27-cent payment shortfall. “After years peddling the kind of dangerous mortgage-backed securities that eventually blew up the economy, Mnuchin swooped in after the crash to take a second bite out of families by aggressively — and sometimes illegally — foreclosing on their homes,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren said in a statement last month. Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, warned: “Given Mr. Mnuchin’s history of profiting off the victims of predatory lending, I look forward to asking him how his Treasury Department would work for Americans who are still waiting for the economic recovery to show up in their communities.” The consistent violations of California foreclosure processes outlined in the memo would indicate that Mnuchin’s bank didn’t merely act callously, but did so with blatant disregard for the law. According to the memo, OneWest also obstructed the investigation by ordering third parties to refuse to comply with state subpoenas. Whether Mnuchin directed efforts to prevent scrutiny of his bank’s practices could be a focus of the confirmation hearings. The memo also raises questions about then-California Attorney General Kamala Harris, who was sworn in as a U.S. senator on Tuesday, and who will soon have to vote on Mnuchin’s appointment. Why did her office close the case, deciding not to “conduct a full investigation of a national bank’s misconduct and provide a public accounting of what happened,” as her own investigators had urged? State and federal law enforcement have been severely criticized for failing to hold accountable those responsible for the financial crisis and its aftermath. The OneWest case provides another example, and this time, the failure to prosecute could help the nation’s next treasury secretary get confirmed. To understand the importance of these revelations, one needs to know a bit about California’s nonjudicial foreclosure process. If a homeowner misses mortgage payments and no resolution can be worked out, the lender files a notice of default, starting a 90-day clock where the homeowner can either repay the debt or face a sale of their property. In the original deed of trust that establishes the mortgage, the lender designates a third-party trustee to handle the sale process in case of foreclosure. Lenders can change trustees at any time, memorializing this with a “substitution of trustee” document (SOT). After the 90 days expire, if the homeowner is still in default, the trustee can record a notice of sale, setting a date for the auction at least 21 days thereafter. The winner of the auction gets the home, and can proceed to evict the homeowner. Because no judge oversees this process, adherence to the rules is paramount. “Compliance with the law gives us confidence in the outcome,” said Katherine Porter, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, and an expert on foreclosures. “The whole scheme is a gift from the legislature to the mortgage industry. If the state is giving the industry benefits to take shortcuts, it’s reasonable to expect the industry to comply strictly with that process.” And according to the state investigation, OneWest wasn’t following the rules. OneWest already had a history of using false documents in foreclosures. A July 2009 deposition of Vice President Erica Johnson-Seck revealed that she “robo-signed” 6,000 foreclosure-related papers per week, spending just 30 seconds on each sworn affidavit that attested to the veracity of all relevant information in the case. Johnson-Seck even admitted to not reading the documents before signing them. OneWest entered into a consent order in April 2011 with the now-defunct federal Office of Thrift Supervision over related failures in the foreclosure process. Knowing that OneWest foreclosed on thousands of California homeowners, the Consumer Law Section decided to investigate in 2012. Because of federal pre-emption rules, state prosecutors cannot subpoena national banks for information about their core functions prior to filing a lawsuit. But the California attorney general’s office was nevertheless able to review over 204,000 publicly available foreclosure documents filed with county recording offices throughout the state, along with other documents purchased from a website called ForeclosureRadar (now called PropertyRadar) that tracks foreclosure activity. Working through the county records, the attorneys immediately uncovered a startling finding: 86 OneWest documents changing the designation of third-party trustees (SOTs) bore a date prior to March 19, 2009, the date OneWest opened for business. Some dated back to 2008. “Because it would have been impossible for OneWest to sign the instruments before it became an operational bank,” four deputy attorneys general from the Consumer Law Section wrote in the memo, “we deduced that the instruments were backdated.” Prosecutors also issued subpoenas to third parties with access to OneWest documents. According to their memo, one subpoena went to Lender Processing Services, a company that assisted with foreclosure operations. LPS produced a random sample of 300 OneWest loan files and agreed to send more, but on February 13, 2012, Jennifer Gray, OneWest’s head of litigation, told the attorney general’s office that “the loan files belonged to OneWest and that LPS could not produce them.” The Consumer Law Section feared OneWest would sue them to stop the investigation, as they did in January 2010, when a lawsuit shut down an inquiry into OneWest’s reverse mortgage subsidiary Financial Freedom. So prosecutors only got the 300 LPS files. Mnuchin spokesperson Tara Bradshaw said that “state attorneys general have no jurisdiction to investigate federally chartered banks like OneWest. When OneWest pointed that out to the California attorney general’s office, they withdrew their subpoena.” (Brian Brooks, the lead lawyer on that 2010 OneWest lawsuit, eventually became OneWest’s Vice Chairman.) The relatively few additional files prosecutors were able to obtain revealed more evidence of backdating. The Consumer Law Section reviewed 913 documents from Quality Loan Service Corp., a trustee that worked with OneWest; 909 of them were backdated. The LPS files included backdated documents as well. Investigators determined this because the document metadata showing the dates of execution showed later dates than the ones stamped on the documents themselves. Investigators surmised that OneWest listed trustees on notices of default before formally executing the SOTs, then backdated the SOTs to make it look like those trustees were already in place at the time the notice of default was issued. Had OneWest put the correct date on the SOTs, they would have had to file new notices of default, restarting the 90-day clock and delaying the foreclosure. “That’s consistent with a pattern of creating whatever documents that appear necessary at the time that they’re created to grease the wheels of the foreclosure machine,” said Mark Zanides, a former federal prosecutor who has represented homeowners in California. The memo also alleges that OneWest occasionally acted as the loan owner on these SOTs when it was merely the servicer — and therefore did not have the authority to execute the documents. Other SOTs were recorded in county offices without being signed or without being dated. Trustees acting on OneWest’s behalf also did not honor the 90-day waiting period in dozens of instances, issuing the notice of sale prior to the deadline. In other cases, SOTs were never mailed to homeowners notifying them of the identity of the new trustees with the power to sell their homes. Finally, investigators found irregularities with foreclosure sales. At auction, bidders must typically pay the full amount by cash or cashier’s check. But the “present beneficiary” — the current owner of the mortgage — can make a “credit bid” at the beginning of the auction if they want to keep the property themselves. These credit bids, usually for the amount due on the loan, typically stop other bidders, who would never be able to profit from a re-sale if they paid full price for a foreclosed home. “Credit bids generally have the effect of deterring or entirely chilling a competitive bidding process,” said Katherine Porter. The Consumer Law Section found that, as with the SOTs, the key documents assigning beneficial interest in the loan sometimes were created after the auctions. In other words, OneWest made or directed others to make credit bids despite not being the present beneficiary. Not only did this mean the winner of the auction may have made an unlawful bid, but credit bidders were exempt from significant documentary transfer taxes imposed by cities and counties. Those taxes range from $1.10 to $16.10 for every $1,000 of purchase price. Submitting credit bids saved OneWest and its partners from paying the taxes. In 2015, CIT Bank bought OneWest. In a statement, CIT spokesperson Matthew Klein said that “CIT complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including California’s foreclosure process and all applicable servicing guidelines, and has implemented enhancements that strengthen the overall operations and controls at OneWest Bank.” The January 18, 2013, document obtained by The Intercept, known as a “package memo,” was a pitch from the deputy attorneys general in the Consumer Law Section to their superiors. It laid out the evidence obtained, ran through the resources required for the case and the likelihood of success, and gave pros and cons for filing. In conjunction with the package memo, investigators directly made their case to supervisors and members of Attorney General Harris’s executive committee. Though the state investigators could not subpoena OneWest and were obstructed from obtaining more documents, they extrapolated that a full and unencumbered inquiry would yield at least 5,600 violations of foreclosure sale auctions, and turn up instances of backdating in nearly all of the 35,000 foreclosures OneWest had completed in California from 2009 to 2012. They wrote that there would be “substantial public justice value” in such an investigation, which could only proceed through the discovery process of a civil lawsuit. That discovery could have turned up other examples of noncompliance which may have been even more harmful to homeowners. The attorneys wrote that scrutinizing the scope of OneWest’s misconduct would provide public accountability, and enhance the deterrent to violating state foreclosure laws. They hoped to get injunctive relief, forcing OneWest to verify the accuracy of every foreclosure document they issued. That’s on top of civil penalties, which could be up to $2,500 for each violation, and double for “protected classes” like senior citizens or the disabled. Additional restitution could proceed from any premature foreclosures executed as a result of the misconduct. The case did not contemplate criminal indictments, even though many of the violations described were felonies; Consumer Law is a civil enforcement section. The prosecutors made clear to their superiors that the case would be a tough one, with no guarantee of success. They said they expected litigation to chew up substantial resources and last three to five years (which would have been about now). “We face a higher than average risk that the court may choose to award minimal amounts of restitution and/or penalties,” they wrote, explaining that they expected OneWest to argue that homeowners defaulted on their mortgages and were therefore not harmed by process violations. Indeed, California courts have been known to accept such arguments. In a recent case against OneWest, a trial court agreed that a homeowner alleging improper documents in his mortgage case “never claimed he was not in default or that the ‘true lender’ would have refrained from foreclosing under the circumstances.” Similarly, in a 2015 case against OneWest for failing to execute an SOT before issuing the notice of default — precisely the violation at issue in the Consumer Law Section investigation — the First District Court of Appeal allowed the foreclosure to go forward. But those were cases brought by individual homeowners, rather than by a state law enforcement apparatus charged with policing noncompliance with statutory laws. Consumer Law planned to argue that “while it may be true that the homeowners were delinquent on their mortgage obligations, that did not change the fact that they were denied the procedural protections required by law.” Legal experts agree that ignoring clear violations would make a joke of California’s foreclosure law. “The foreclosure statutes establish a proper way to do things that will ensure that all parties are treated fairly,” said former federal prosecutor Mark Zanides. “If you ignore that, you’ve reduced yourself to a banana republic, where courts sworn to uphold the law are precluded from doing so by being given documents that are false.” Mnuchin spokesperson Tara Bradshaw, without commenting on the violations themselves, would only say by way of justification, “the attorney general’s office made no finding of any violation and took no action against OneWest.” Consumer Law Section attorneys recommended “that the attorney general authorize us to file a civil enforcement action against OneWest.” Two months later, they were told that the office would not move forward with the complaint. OneWest representatives were not even brought in for a meeting to discuss the matter. So why didn’t Kamala Harris leap at the chance to take on a bank that her staff said was illegally rushing Californians out of their homes? Why did she reject a case that her office had already spent significant resources on during a year of line-level investigation? Kristin Ford, communications director at the attorney general’s office, did not respond to a detailed request for comment. Without an official explanation, we can only speculate why Harris passed up the opportunity. Perhaps she judged the case too difficult, or not a high enough priority, or not having enough of a human interest. Or maybe it was something else. Harris has been criticized for a lack of vigor in prosecuting foreclosure fraud before. She set up a Mortgage Fraud Strike Force in 2011, dedicated to “protect innocent homeowners and bring justice to those who defraud them.” But despite hundreds of complaints of loan modification fraud — a primary target identified by the office — it only prosecuted 10 cases in the first three years. County district attorneys and even attorneys general in other states filed many more California-based cases, despite more limited resources. And some of the cases Harris did file began under her predecessor Jerry Brown or were organized by other local and federal law enforcement teams; Harris just gave her strike-force credit for them. In fact, many of the cases Harris’s office is known for were part of multistate or prior investigations. The 2012 $25 billion National Mortgage Settlement with five large mortgage servicers (Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Ally Bank) over allegations of illegal foreclosure practices, which Harris touted in campaign ads, was a 49-state and federal matter, where she was not deeply involved with negotiations and was criticized as a grandstander. The Intercept asked Harris’s office for a breakdown of cases initiated and prosecuted by the Consumer Law Section during her tenure. They have not yet provided them. Rigid hierarchies within Harris’s office were known to have made it difficult to get cases moving. Sign-offs to open investigations, issue subpoenas, and proceed with enforcement all traveled through a chain of command from senior assistant attorneys general running the various divisions, to a small inner circle of special assistants known as the executive committee, to Harris. And this created a bottleneck, especially if Harris was tending to other matters. She has been criticized for luxury travel spending and a relentless nationwide campaign schedule throughout her attorney general tenure. Many special assistants came from Harris’s district attorney staff in San Francisco, and several are joining her in Washington as she enters the U.S. Senate. The investigators who actually did the ground work in the OneWest case were not present for executive committee decision-making. One of the supervisors involved in the OneWest case, Supervising Deputy Attorney General Benjamin Diehl, left the office in November 2013 to join Stroock Stroock & Lavan, a corporate law firm that represents Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup in cases against consumers, regulatory agencies and state attorneys general. Emails indicate that Diehl arranged private meetings with Stroock partners six months before his hiring, while he still worked for the attorney general. Stroock would not make Diehl available for comment. Harris’s prodigious fundraising also raises questions about how attentive she is to the needs of campaign contributors. Prior to signing on with Trump, Mnuchin donated to members of both parties. He gave $2,000 to Harris’ Senate campaign in February 2016. Among the investors in OneWest Bank was major Democratic donor George Soros, who maxed out to Harris’ campaign in 2015. “I don’t know why they didn’t move forward,” said Paulina Gonzalez of the California Reinvestment Coalition, a state housing advocacy group. “There’s some really concerning information in this document that would say to us there needs to be further investigation. … This is damning evidence of clear violations.” Gonzalez, whose organization has been tracking OneWest for several years, also received a copy of the package memo and sample complaint in the mail. Her copy came “with Wonder Woman stamps and the return address of Planned Parenthood,” Gonzalez said. The copy sent to us had no return address. With Mnuchin set to take over the Treasury Department, Gonzalez said the memo raises “real concerns about his ethics and potential for illegal behavior.” She said her organization would take up the matter with OneWest’s federal regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), along with Harris’ replacement as California attorney general, Xavier Becerra. Bradshaw, the Mnuchin spokesperson, provided a report from the OCC showing relatively fewer error rates in OneWest foreclosures than other national banks. But those were reviewed under the context of harm to borrowers, not statutory noncompliance. OneWest may also have violated a loss share agreement signed with the FDIC upon purchasing assets from the failed lender IndyMac. That agreement, which backstopped OneWest losses on foreclosures, committed OneWest to make good faith options to try to avoid them. Violations that sped up foreclosures could indicate that the bank didn’t make such an effort. Senate Democrats have already attacked Mnuchin over OneWest’s foreclosure practices, even setting up a website inviting foreclosure victims to tell their stories. One of those victims, Teena Colebrook, voted for Donald Trump but lost her faith in that decision after the Mnuchin pick. In an interview, Colebrook alleged discrepancies on her substitution of trustee, similar to what was described in the package memo. “It has to get out why this man should not be put in charge of Treasury,” said Colebrook. “Nobody minds a billionaire, but not one feeding off people’s misery.” Colebrook says she sent materials to Kamala Harris years earlier, asking her to help her save her home. Harris’s response? “She said ‘We can’t get involved in an individual case.’” Top photo: Steven Mnuchin at Trump Tower in November.

X What is this? Sponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen Canadians living in Alberta and Ontario saw gas prices spike in the New Year due to carbon pricing. But don’t expect the price hikes to stop there. Story continues below “I think 2017 is probably going to be more expensive than the past two to three years, and not just for gasoline but also for diesel,” gasoline analyst Dan McTeague told Global News Tuesday. The carbon taxes are intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and slow climate change. Along with the carbon pricing, an OPEC agreement to cut global production of oil will also put pressure on prices at the pump. READ MORE: Oil prices hit 18-month high as OPEC output deal kicks in “This is likely to send oil and gasoline prices that much higher,” said McTeague. An increase in fuel costs will also take a bite out of the budgets of non-drivers. Here’s a look at the various ways higher fuel prices will impact Canadians. How much rising fuel will cost drivers There are a range of vehicles on the road, from ultra-fuel efficient to gas guzzlers. Some hybrid vehicles will consume in the neighbourhood of 5 litres per 100 kilometres. At $1 per litre, annual fuel costs sit around $1,000 if someone drives approximately 20,000 kilometres. A bump of 10 cents per litre pushes annual costs to $1,100, an annual increase of $100. WATCH: What will Alberta’s carbon tax cost you? Some trucks and large SUVs consume roughly 15 litres per 100 kilometres of driving. At $1 per litre, annual fuel costs sit around $3,000 for the same 20,000 kilometres. A bump of 10 cents per litre pushes annual costs to $3,300, an annual increase of $300. If gas prices rise by 20 cents, expect that cost to double to $200 annually for fuel efficient vehicles, and budget an additional $600 for heavy duty trucks. Of course, many vehicles will fall in between or outside this range. Online tools can help you calculate how much fuel hikes will cost you in the long-term. As costs rise, consumer spending likely to shrink The costs of goods and services are also expected to rise due to an increase in the cost of doing business. “When diesel goes up, so does the cost of goods and services,” said McTeague. “One would have to look at the inflationary impact this is going to have — things like groceries, things like transportation, public and personal, will be going up. READ MORE: Cap and trade to cost Ontario residents, businesses $8B in first years: report “It’s going to be a very costly year.” This puts a further pinch on overall budgets, which can put a freeze on consumer spending. WATCH : New Year marks the beginning of Alberta’s carbon levy When gas prices are low, people tend to put most of the money saved on fuel (80 per cent) back into the economy — things like eating out, groceries and other goods, according to data from JPMorgan Chase and Co. “A substantial increase in gas prices might proportionately dampen consumer spend,” the report states. McTeague suggests the average Ontario family budget will take a $350 hit this year due to the changes. Rural disadvantage A rise in gas prices can prompt some people to instead use public transit, but that often isn’t an option for rural residents who rely on personal vehicles. Ontario MPP Steve Clark, representing Leeds-Grenville and deputy leader of the Ontario PC party, said his office has already received dozens of calls and emails since provincial cap-and-trade was introduced on Jan. 1. READ MORE: How much do you spend on tax at the pump? His constituency is largely rural, with limited, if any public transit. “Having a vehicle for family use is a necessity, it’s not a luxury, they need it. And this is going to put them under real strain.” He said this is another slap in the face for rural families already paying some of the highest hydro prices in the country. WATCH: Sticker shock jolts Ontario drivers at the gas pumps “Rural residents, with policies like this, are put under increased strain compared to urban residents,” said Clark. And while public transit isn’t an option for many rural residents, neither is driving a compact, fuel-efficient vehicle.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Wall Street rose sharply on Tuesday as a post-election rally extended into the new year, helped by gains in Verizon Communications and technology companies Alphabet and Facebook. U.S. stocks have surged over the past two months on expectations that President-elect Donald Trump will stimulate the economy with tax cuts and infrastructure spending and slash regulations in the financial industry. "The market is picking up where it left off since the Trump presidency," said Thomas Wilson, senior investment manager at Brinker Capital. "What you are seeing is the market moving up in anticipation of fiscal expansion." However, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading near the never-before-reached 20,000 mark, some investors warned that additional strong gains would be unlikely in the short term. They want to see evidence that Trump's campaign-trail promises will be approved by Republican lawmakers concerned about widening the federal budget deficit. "The president-elect can't just wave a magic wand," said Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia. "He has to deal with Congress, and Congress hasn't proved to be able to agree with itself." The Dow came within a hair's breadth of the historic 20,000 milestone in December but it has since fallen back. The average rose to as much as 19,938.53 earlier in the session on Tuesday, helped by Walt Disney . Ford Motor jumped 3.79 percent. The carmaker said it would cancel a planned US$1.6-billion factory in Mexico and invest US$700 million at a Michigan factory, after Trump had harshly criticized the Mexico investment plan. Oil prices hit an 18-month high before turning negative and falling more than 2 percent. The S&P energy index rose 1.15 percent, with Exxon Mobil up 0.70 percent. The U.S. dollar touched a 14-year high after data showed U.S. factory activity accelerated to a two-year high in December. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 119.16 points, or 0.6 percent, to end at 19,881.76 points and the S&P 500 gained 0.85 percent to 2,257.83. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.85 percent to 5,429.08. Verizon gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500, rising 2.25 percent after Citigroup upgraded the stock to "buy." Also boosting the S&P 500, Google parent-company Alphabet rose 1.96 percent and Facebook added 1.57 percent. The S&P health index rose 1.40 percent, with Merck & Co up 2.17 percent and Gilead Sciences rising 3.56 percent. The S&P utilities index dipped 0.30 percent, the only index down among 11 S&P sectors. Marathon Petroleum rose 5.12 percent after the company said it would explore a spinoff of its retail business, caving to pressure from activist investor Elliott Management. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.24-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.79-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 121 new highs and 26 new lows.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Wall Or No Wall, Mexico’s Economy Faces Many Headwinds This Year January 3, 2017 10:34am NYSE:EWW ShareTweet While many market pundits have focused on the prospect of a massive wall built between the U.S. and Mexico as the largest risk facing the country’s economy, Mexico has even larger issues to deal with. The Trump administration’s treatment of the country will certainly impact things, but other problems like weak GDP growth, central banking questions, and how to manage its currency will take center stage. Central bankers in our neighbors to the south may even need to cut interest rates. From Bloomberg: Perhaps the last thing a country with anemic growth needs is higher interest rates, but the central bank may not be able to avoid tightening. Inflation is expected to run well above the 4 percent top end of the institution’s target throughout 2017, according to forecasts from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB and JPMorgan Chase & Co., as the government moves ahead with plans to raise the price of gasoline by as much as 20 percent in January. Mexican stocks have been weak as of late. The EWW, the largest ETF focused on Mexican equities, is down nearly 17% over the past five years. That anemic performance comes despite big gains in the U.S., Europe, and some areas of Emerging Markets in that same time frame. To turn things around this year, Mexican regulators will have to tread very carefully. The iShares MSCI Mexico Capped ETF (NYSE:EWW) was trading at $44.62 per share on Tuesday morning, up $0.65 (+1.48%). Over the past year, EWW has declined -9.40%, versus an +11.56% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. EWW currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of C (Neutral), and is ranked #11 of 20 ETFs in the Latin America ETFs category.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Silver-To-S&P 500 Ratio Suggests Big Upside Ahead For Silver January 3, 2017 11:23am NYSE:SLV ShareTweet From Gary Christenson: Silver prices nearly reached $50.00 in April of 2011. They crashed to a low under $14 in December of 2015 and currently (January 2017) sit at about $16. Silver prices, in our increasingly unreal debt based fiat currency world, streak higher and subsequently crash to unbelievable lows. Option One: Silver prices are near the end of their correction and will rally substantially higher. Why? Exponential increases in debt and total currency in circulation lift the prices for nearly everything, including college tuition, cigarettes, the S&P, housing, health care, silver and gold. We have heard this before and we see the consequences of using our “fake money” every day. Option Two: Silver prices reached a generational high in 2011 and will collapse even further in coming years. Why? Supposedly the crushing deflation will rule the world for several years and prices for stocks, bonds, real estate, gold and silver will crash to unbelievable lows. We have heard this before. Some prices will probably crash, but silver and gold should rise because they are real money and independent of(surging) counter-party risk. The Silver to S&P 500 Ratio: This ratio shows the relative valuation of silver compared to stocks in the U.S. See the chart below for the ratio since 1990. Silver is currently too low compared to the S&P 500 Index. We live in an exponential world – exponentially increasing debt, banker profits, silver prices, monetary nonsense and more. Examine the increase in U.S. national debt and the – more or less – parallel increase in silver prices – both on log scales. Silver prices increase exponentially along with debt, currency in circulation, and consumer prices. However, if the world had cast aside economic delusions and returned to a world without central banks, fiat money, fractional reserve lending, unpayable debts … but I digress. Assume that debt will continue to increase (it will as long as politicians and the Fed are “on the job”) and that the last 17 years of silver prices tell the story… This chart uses a log scale and shows exponentially increasing prices. A green line connects highs since 2001 and another green line connects lows since 2001. The purple line is the geometric mean between the high and low boundary lines. Prices are propelled higher above the purple line and then crash lower. Assume the purple line is an equilibrium line which suggests we will see the next multi-year move surge above the purple line. Examine the deviation of the monthly price of silver as a percentage above or below the purple equilibrium line. Silver prices oscillate around the equilibrium line of zero on the following chart. Silver is far below the equilibrium line and too low compared to its own exponential price history as well as compared to the S&P. The next major move should be UP! WHY? Ted Butler: (Subscription service and here.) “The big theme, as I see it, is JPMorgan becoming more aggressive in acquiring physical silver and gold while at the same time reducing its COMEX short position in each almost as aggressively. It’s hard to imagine a more bullish backdrop for futures prices.” Bill Holter: (Subscription service) “I believe deflation will destroy financial assets and not stop until fiat currencies (including and specifically the dollar) themselves are destroyed. The coming credit event will wipe out currencies … and what is the result of grossly lower or worthless currencies? Hyperinflation.” Currencies are created by increasing debt and are backed by nothing but hope, faith and confidence. Exponentially increasing debt is not sustainable. How long before the dollar, pound, yen and euro begin to resemble the Venezuelan and Argentinian currencies? It is more sensible to own physical silver, knowing it is grossly undervalued compared to the S&P, national debt, total sovereign debt, and more. THE RUSSIAN CONNECTION: In accordance with the current blame-game promoted by the “fake news” diversions: We can blame Russia for HRC losing the election, releasing scandalous emails that the Democratic National Committee desperately wishes had remained private, the election of Trump, NSA spying on everyone, global terrorism, excess debt in the western world, the failure of hope and change, Federal Reserve monetary policy, unemployment, weak silver prices, strong stock markets, global bond market correction, the coming recession, derivatives disasters, slowing retail sales, Italian banking, cold weather, one brutally assassinated reindeer no longer able to pull Santa’s sleigh and a tardy delivery of goodies from the Easter Bunny next year… Well … maybe Russia should not be blamed for all the above. The iShares Silver Trust ETF (NYSE:SLV) was trading at $15.52 per share on Tuesday morning, up $0.41 (+2.71%). Over the past year, the largest ETF tied to silver prices has gained 17.66%, versus a 11.24% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. SLV currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of C (Neutral), and is ranked #4 of 29 ETFs in the Precious Metals ETFs category. This article is brought to you courtesy of Sprott Money.

It's back to school for financial markets. Bonds are out, stocks are in. Inflation in the developed world is on the prowl. Optimism for U.S. growth and corporate profits is sky-high. And President-elect Donald Trump casts a dark shadow over the outlook for global trade.  In short, from inflation to manufacturing to bond yields to global trade, 2017 may herald a number of sea-changes for financial markets. Here are eight charts that paint the market landscape ahead. Inflation breakout One of the biggest themes for 2017 — the rising outlook for inflation — was underscored on Tuesday after German consumer prices staged a sharp 1.7 percent rise from a year ago, beating expectations of a 1.3 percent advance. Though underlying price pressures remain weak, the data may embolden European Central Bank hawks who argue the euro-area economy is on a firmer footing, justifying a shift away from loose monetary policies. Analysts at Societe Generale SA reckon ECB tapering fears are likely to haunt markets once more in the second half of the year.  Commodity reflation Headline inflation data in the euro-area and the U.S. in the coming months may be fueled by a pick-up in energy prices. West Texas Intermediate crude rose to $55 a barrel for the first time since July 2015, amid output cuts in Kuwait and Oman that suggest OPEC and its partners are going to deliver on an agreement forged last year to scale back production.  Dollar devotion Markets are also grappling with the prospects for the greenback after its Trump-fueled climb. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the currency against 10 of its peers, has notched a 6.5 percent gain since the Nov. 8 election, as expectations of looser regulations, higher government spending, and lower taxes bolster the outlook for U.S. growth and inflation. The dollar rally raises a slew of questions for investors: Will the strength of the greenback pose a headwind for U.S. output in the second half of the year? Will it vex the Federal Reserve's monetary-tightening path? Given the dollar's role as the principal global funding currency, will its spirited strength crimp emerging market liquidity and growth? Elephant in the room China is one emerging market country that is reeling from the effects of a stronger dollar, which is serving to fuel capital outflows and tighten onshore domestic liquidity. To this end, China dropped a year-end surprise on sleepy currency markets, when it downgraded the relative importance of the dollar in its trade-weighted foreign-exchange basket, in an effort to better reflect the yuan's valuation against its trading partners. Though the move may have eased the risk of a one-off devaluation, yuan-depreciation expectations have surged year-on-year.  All eyes are on China's foreign-exchange holding data, which will update with last month's figures on Jan. 7. If they drop below the psychologically-significant $3 trillion threshold, the currency would come under further pressure, complicating Beijing's bid to incent private investment and rein in credit growth. Manufacturing cycle An uptick in the global industrial production cycle may give Chinese policy makers some breathing space. On Tuesday, we learned U.K. manufacturing data for December advanced at its fastest pace in 30 months, helped by resilient demand and a weaker pound. In addition, Institute for Supply Management data showed that last month American manufacturing grew at its fastest pace in two years, underscoring soaring business confidence. Euro-area manufacturing also grew in December, at its fastest pace since April 2011, feeding the market narrative that inflationary pressures are building up in the developed world, and that Corporate Europe is on a stronger footing.  Analysts at JPMorgan Chase Bank say a pickup in business spending and goods price inflation will fuel an uptick in global manufacturing in 2017, with strong export data in Asia in November and December highlighting the growth in final-goods demand.  Shifting yield curves Another major theme this year is the outlook for term premiums — the extra compensation investors demand to hold longer-dated government bonds relative to shorter-dated obligations. In the U.S., U.K., and euro-area, they fell sharply in the middle of last year as markets bet that central banks would keep monetary policies loose. According to analysts at Societe Generale SA, rising U.S. Treasury issuance and price pressures could fuel a notable rise in the term premium this year, as yield curves in the developed world remain flat relative to low absolute yields on short-dated obligations. Societe Generale SA The shape of the Treasury curve will heavily influence the capital-flow cycle in emerging markets this year, as much as the pace of Fed monetary tightening itself, if history is any guide. Capex hopes There is also a risk that markets have priced in too much good news too soon, if corporate earnings, other economic data, or fiscal policies disappoint expectations in the coming months.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter One reason why analysts are bullish about U.S. output and stocks this year, despite the aforementioned headwinds, is the capital expenditure cycle. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. say the great stagnation in inflation-adjusted U.S. business investment is set to draw to a close this year, thanks to the prospect that higher energy prices lift corporate profits and, therefore, lift capital spending. Goldman Sachs Group Inc According to AllianceBernstein Holding LP, a reduction in global capex last year crimped world GDP by one percentage point. The asset management firm says that pent-up capital spending may be ready to "break out" this year as corporate earnings improve, a boon for cyclical industries and infrastructure firms. Political trumps Financial markets threw caution to the wind last month, pricing in buoyant growth even as the specter of global trade wars looms large. Just two-and-a-half weeks before his inauguration, Trump tweeted another protectionist sideswipe at Beijing.  China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017 Here's the projected impact on China's exports and GDP under different U.S. tariff levels, according to Daiwa Capital Markets.  Daiwa Capital Markets   Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Banks to reveal post-Brexit plans Published time: 3 Jan, 2017 17:09Edited time: 6 Jan, 2017 09:54 Get short URL Canary Wharf and the city are seen at sunset in London. © Eddie Keogh / Reuters Banks in the City of London will tell investors as early as next month whether they plan to move their operations out of post-Brexit Britain, it has emerged. UK-based lenders are finalizing Brexit contingency plans to decide how much of their business they need to shift overseas to maintain relationships with the remaining 27 EU member states, according to the Guardian. Read more Mass exodus of London bankers could come early 2017, financial institutions warn Prime Minister Theresa May intends to trigger Article 50 – the formal process for exiting the EU – in March. The local authority for the City of London Corporation has urged May to make transition arrangements “as soon as possible” to allay the concerns of businesses, which have been delaying investment decisions. At present, it appears that Brexit negotiations will prioritize control over immigration above retaining unfettered access to the single market, meaning that London-based banks could be left without “passporting rights,” which allow them to work across the bloc and give them tariff-free access to the single market. Andrew Gray, head of Brexit at the consultancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), which is advising several financial services institutions, said announcements could begin coming out in February, when banks publish their preliminary results. In the run-up to the June 23 referendum, banks warned about the possible consequences of a decision to leave the EU. Read more London’s 328-year-old Lloyd’s insurance market plans EU move in the coming year US bank JPMorgan said it could move 4,000 employees from its 19,000-strong UK workforce, according to the Guardian. Britain’s biggest bank, HSBC, said it may need to shift about 1,000 UK staff members to its existing operations in Paris. According to the Financial Times, Lloyds Banking Group is planning to open a subsidiary in mainland Europe to maintain access to the European Union’s single market after Britain leaves the EU. The lender is looking at placing the unit in either Germany or the Netherlands, where it already has branches. A report that PwC compiled for the lobby group CityUK estimates that there could be 100,000 fewer banking jobs in the UK by 2020. The director of policy and strategy at CityUK, Gary Campkin, said that businesses do not want to move out of Britain. “People are here for a reason. It’s a good place to do business. “The important thing is to make sure we focus on ensuring decisions aren’t made too early or too quickly and that’s why stability is crucial,” he said.

Oil prices were up 0.24 percent at $57.06 after touching a high of $58.37 as investors keep a close watch on whether major producers keep their promise of limiting output. The retreat in stocks meant the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped away from 20,000 - a mark it has never hit before. The Dow came within a hair's breadth of the milestone in December as investors bet that President-elect Donald Trump would introduce market friendly policies such as tax cuts and simpler regulation. The average rose to as much as 19,938.53 earlier in the session on Tuesday, supported by gains in Goldman Sachs and Walt Disney. "The market is picking up where it left off since the Trump presidency," said Thomas Wilson, senior investment manager at Brinker Capital. "What you are seeing is the market moving up in anticipation of fiscal expansion and a potential reflation trade that will replace what has been a monetary policy-driven market for the last several years." Technology stocks were the main drivers of the gains on Wall Street on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 technology sector rising 0.9 percent and giving the broader index its biggest boost. Financials were up 0.9 percent after Barclays raised price targets on several Wall Street banks including Bank of America, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan. Also feeding Wall Street's gains was data that showed U.S. factory activity expanded to a two-year high in December. The dollar index rose to a 14-year high. At 10:59 a.m. EDT the Dow Jones industrial average was up 74.48 points, or 0.38 percent, at 19,837.08, the S&P 500 was up 13.72 points, or 0.61 percent, at 2,252.55 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 32.14 points, or 0.6 percent, at 5,415.25. Ten of the 11 major S&P 500 indexes were higher, with the defensive real estate and consumer staples sectors bringing up the rear. Utilities, another defensive sector, was the only one in the red. Marathon Petroleum rose 6.9 percent to $53.7 after the company said it would explore a spinoff of its retail business, caving to pressure from activist investor Elliott Management. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,005 to 870. On the Nasdaq, 1,689 issues rose and 1,032 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 17 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 97 new highs and 14 new lows.

Paris will make its case to London-based executives in meetings as it competes for talent with rival cities such as Frankfurt.  (Francois Mori / The Associated Press)   By Gavin Finch John DetrixheBloomberg Tues., Jan. 3, 2017 Paris could lure as many as 20,000 workers from Britain’s finance industry with the exodus potentially starting within weeks as the U.K. begins its withdrawal from the European Union, according to Europlace, the French capital’s lobby group. Paris will make its case to London-based executives in a series of February meetings as it competes for talent with rival cities such as Frankfurt. Europlace’s marketing materials show it will extol how Paris already employs more than 180,000 financiers, is home to the region’s biggest bond market and boasts the second-largest pool of asset managers. The continental race to take advantage of Brexit is heating up as British Prime Minister Theresa May plans to trigger the start of negotiations by the end of March. Global bank chiefs have warned May that they will soon start shifting operations and jobs from the U.K. to elsewhere in the EU unless she can protect their easy access to its market. “We feel decisions will be taken in the first semester of the new year,” Arnaud de Bresson, Europlace’s managing director, said in an interview in London. “We see institutions are accelerating their process of thinking.” With time at a premium, bankers say they want to establish new or expanded offices in the EU before the U.K. leaves, which is currently set for sometime in 2019. May says she wants to strike the best possible deal for banks, yet hasn’t detailed what she will seek and has also declined to fully endorse the transitional phase the industry wants to smooth the departure. Article Continued Below In the run-up to the June referendum, HSBC Holdings Plc said that it planned to move as many as 1,000 employees to Paris from London if voters backed Brexit, while Citigroup Inc. is now considering relocating some of its London-based equity and interest-rate derivatives traders to Frankfurt. TheCityUK lobby group warns that almost 70,000 jobs are up for grabs. JPMorgan Chase & Co. could, in “some scenarios,” move 4,000 jobs away from the U.K. because of Brexit, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in an interview with Financial News published Tuesday, reiterating a figure he laid out before the vote. Dimon said the shift would take place over several years and could be accelerated if an interim agreement on banking services isn’t reached. The state agency for winning investment in Ireland said Tuesday the country is among a small number of European locations being studied by businesses to mitigate risks from Brexit. IDA Ireland says it has received a “significant volume” of queries from firms in the U.K., U.S. and Asia since the referendum vote. Europlace will argue Paris is better placed than other aspirants for London’s crown. It touts the city as the top hub in continental Europe for interest-rate swaps trading with some $141 billion of the derivatives changing hands in France every day. That compares with $1.18 trillion in the U.K. It will also promote itself as a city of requisite skills, contrasted with Frankfurt employing fewer than 100,000 people in finance and Dublin just 30,000. Another asset in its eyes is that French corporations are typically based in Paris, whereas German ones are located in different areas in the country. Although it hosts some of Europe’s biggest banks, including Societe Generale SA and BNP Paribas SA, France has nevertheless long lagged behind the U.K. and Germany as an international hub for banking. The country is perceived as hostile to financial companies and ranks 29th in the Global Financial Centres Index, only one spot above Casablanca. Even its stock exchange, Euronext NV is threatened by Deutsche Boerse AG’s planned takeover of London Stock Exchange Group Plc, which would create Europe’s dominant market operator. France’s tight labour laws have also put off banks that value longer work weeks and an employment regime that allows easy hiring and firing. De Bresson said Europlace is pushing lawmakers to relax such curbs. Read more about: France The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Continue Reading Below U.S. stocks have surged over the past two months on expectations that Trump will stimulate the economy with tax cuts and infrastructure spending and slash regulations in the financial industry. Now with the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading near the never-before-reached 20,000 mark, some investors say additional strong gains are unlikely in the short term. They want to see evidence that Trump's campaign-trail promises will be approved by Republican lawmakers concerned about widening the federal budget deficit. The S&P 500 rose by over 1 percent on Tuesday before giving up most of those gains, suggesting the rally is losing steam, said Warren West, principal at Greentree Brokerage Services in Philadelphia. "The president-elect can't just wave a magic wand. He has to deal with Congress, and Congress hasn't proved to be able to agree with itself," West said. The Dow came within a hair's breadth of the historic 20,000 milestone in December but it has since fallen back. The average rose to as much as 19,938.53 earlier in the session on Tuesday, helped by Walt Disney <DIS.N>. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Ford Motor <F.N> rose 3.80 percent. The carmaker said it would cancel a planned $1.6 billion factory in Mexico and invest $700 million at a Michigan factory, after Trump had harshly criticized the Mexico investment plan. Oil prices hit 18-month high before turning negative. The S&P energy index <.SPNY> rose 0.53 percent, with Kinder Morgan <KMI.N> up 3.6 percent. The U.S. dollar touched a 14-year high after data showed U.S. factory activity accelerated to a two-year high in December. At 2:42 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average <.DJI> was up 0.17 percent to 19,795.71 points and the S&P 500 <.SPX> had gained 0.38 percent to 2,247.41. The Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> added 0.32 percent to 5,400.56. The S&P health index <.SPXHC> rose 1.06 percent, with Merck & Co <MRK.N> up 2.16 percent and Gilead Sciences <GILD.O> rising 3.39 percent. The S&P utilities index <.SPLRCU> dipped 0.39 percent. Verizon <VZ.N> gave the biggest boost to the S&P 500, rising 1.95 percent after Citigroup upgraded the stock to "buy." Marathon Petroleum <MPC.N> rose 5.2 percent after the company said it would explore a spinoff of its retail business, caving to pressure from activist investor Elliott Management. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.99-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.17-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 112 new highs and 21 new lows.   (Additional reporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Nick Zieminski) What do you think?

After coming within a hair's breadth of the milestone in December as part of a post-election rally, the Dow will make a fresh attempt at breaching the mark. The Dow rose 13.4 percent in 2016 - its best performance in three years - registering strong gains in the past two months as investors bet that Presidential-elect Donald Trump would introduce market friendly policies such as tax cuts and simpler regulation. Dow futures advanced by triple-digit points on Tuesday, helped by a jump in oil prices and upbeat economic data from China. Brent crude hit an 18-month high of $58.06 after a deal to limit oversupply came into effect on Sunday. China's factory activity picked up more than expected in December giving the manufacturing sector a solid boost heading into 2017, according to a private business survey. "We expect a strong start to the day's trading session, as oil prices and the macro news set the stage for the direction of the equities markets this year," Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial, wrote in a client note. The dollar index was on a tear, notching its best day in nearly three weeks at 103.44, while higher inflation data sent European stocks to a one-year high. Dow e-minis were up 133 points, or 0.67 percent at 8:26 a.m. ET (1326 GMT), with 28,004 contracts changing hands. S&P 500 e-minis were up 15.25 points, or 0.68 percent, with 153,651 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 37.25 points, or 0.77 percent, on volume of 23,297 contracts. Data on tap includes the ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Manufacturer's index (PMI), which is expected to have edged up to 53.6 in December from 53.2 in the previous month. The report is due at 10:00 a.m. ET (1700 GMT). Technology stocks including Ebay, Micron Tech , Amazon.com and Facebook were primed for gains Bank of America, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo were up between 0.9 percent and 2 percent after Barclays raised its price targets on the stocks. General Motors slipped by half a percent to $34.65 after Trump slammed the carmaker in a tweet for sending Mexican-made models of its Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers without paying border taxes. Marathon Petroleum rose 3.8 percent to $52.25 after the company said it would explore a spinoff of its retail business, caving to pressure from activist investor Elliott Management.

Walt Disney — Analysts at Evercore ISI upgraded the entertainment giant's stock to "buy" from hold, and raised its price target on the stock to $120 from $103. Evercore cited an improving economic backdrop "and a possible, retroactive [Donald Trump/Paul Ryan] tax reform-adjusted EPS." Evercore said the upgrade is "largely a macro call" as Disney has a business model that benefits from higher inflation and is a largely domestic firm. Verizon — Citi upgraded Verizon shares to "buy" from "neutral," and hiked its price target to $60 from $55. Citi cited an opportunity for multiple expansion "given the prospects to improve free cash flow from a combination of expanding its addressable market for revenue, benefiting from potential tax reform, and improving its strategic position through M&A." Abercrombie & Fitch — The firm's stock was downgraded to "hold" from "buy," noting its turnaround efforts are "progressing at a slower pace than we initially expected." Abercrombie's stock plummeted 55.56 percent in 2016. Xerox — The printer and copier maker's stock spiked more than 10 percent in the premarket after JPMorgan upgraded its stock to "overweight" from "neutral," citing the spinoff of its Conduent business, "which marks the start of a long turnaround process." Xerox shares fell 17.87 percent last year. Intel — The chipmaker is seeking approval to buy a stake in HERE, a digital mapping firm controlled by Daimler, BMW, and Volkswagen, according to the German cartel office. Canadian Solar — The company completed the sale of two solar power plants to Shenzhen Energy for $32.2 million, a transaction that was disclosed December 30. Arch Capital Group — Arch Capital completed the acquisition of United Guaranty, an American International Group subsidiary, for an undisclosed amount. Alamo Group — The company increased its quarterly dividend to 10 cents per share from 9 cents per share.
