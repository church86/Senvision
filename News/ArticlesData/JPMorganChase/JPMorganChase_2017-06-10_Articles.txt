"Our colleague, Matt Zames, Chief Operating Officer, recently informed me of his decision to leave our firm following 13 years of outstanding service," Dimon said in the memo. Zames was considered by many to be a potential successor to Jamie Dimon when the CEO and Chairman eventually decided to step down. The Wall Street Journal in 2014 called him a "potential favorite" for the position because his work in helping Dimon navigate the financial crisis. Dimon said in the memo Zames "was an integral part of the team that helped manage the firm successfully through the financial crisis." "It's very difficult for JPMorgan to hold onto anyone because Jamie Dimon has no intention of leaving," said Dick Bove of Rafferty Capital Markets, noting he didn't think Zames' departure indicated problems within the Wall Street giant. "It is not that unusual for this to happen at JPMorgan," he said. The bank "has become the incubator for presidents and CEOs of other financial companies. That makes it seem very likely that Matt Zames will show up as the CEO of some other company really soon." Sources familiar with the situation told CNBC that Zames wants to run his own company but is unlikely to end up at a rival firm. Zames has many offers but hasn't chosen a new firm yet, the sources said. Tweet The memo did not make it immediately clear that there would be a replacement for Zames, instead laying out a new organizational structure dividing up the COO's roles. JPMorgan did not immediately return a CNBC call for comment. "There's a need on the part of the company to move its executives around in order to give them new challenges," Bove said. The long-time bank analyst said Wednesday it's time to break up the large Wall Street institutions in order for their stocks to do well. The memo said Zames "will be here over the coming weeks to help ensure a smooth transition of his responsibilities." It does not mention any plans beyond that for Zames. — CNBC's Wilfred Frost and John Melloy contributed to this report.

Leasing activity in May was down 21 percent year-over-year at 2.3 million square feet, according to Colliers International. This, despite the fact that Manhattan’s largest new lease of 2017 – BlackRock’s 847,000-square-foot deal at 50 Hudson Yards – closed during the month. Other big deals in May include the city’s Human Resources Administration taking 200,000 square feet at 375 Pearl Street  and Business Insider signing for 88,000 square feet at 1 Liberty Plaza, both in Lower Manhattan. But velocity so far this year has been strong, thanks to big deals earlier on like 21st Century Fox and NewsCorp.’s 1.2 million-square-foot renewal and expansion in Midtown in January and the Royal Bank of Canada’s 402,000-square-foot renewal Downtown in February. In the year’s first five months, total leasing activity stood at 14.6 million square feet, just a little over 5 percent shy of where it was last year, Colliers’ data show. “Year-over-year, the market has been relatively stable, although demand has weakened a bit,” said Colliers’ Craig Caggiano, who pointed out that June is already off to a strong start with JPMorgan finalizing a 305,000-square-foot lease at Brookfield Property Partners’ 5 Manhattan West. “Keep in mind, in just the first full week of June, already there has been at least one significant deal,” he said. “Of course, we’ll see what happens in the next three weeks of the month.” By the midway point of last year, leasing activity stood at 17.8 million square feet, putting 2017 activity 3.2 million square feet shy of that mark at the start of June. So far this year, Manhattan’s been averaging about 3 million square feet of deals a month, and is on track to beat the market’s 10-year average. “Adding in the reported 305,000 square foot lease at 5 Manhattan West by JPMorgan Chase, we can expect total leasing volume during the first half of 2017 to surpass the historical average,” Colliers’ Frank Wallach said. All in all, deal volume in the office leasing market is holding steady, a telling sign as segments such as the investment sales, hotel and retail markets show significant signs of adversity. Another figure that should, at least for the time being, give the market a relative boost of confidence: Net absorption through the first five months of 2017 stood at 1.02 million square feet, a third of what it was the same time last year. In the near term, however, the Manhattan market will still see a significant amount of new supply come online, and by the end of June, the market could record its first span of four-straight quarters of negative absorption since 2008 and 2009.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 ETFs to Keep You Invested After Retirement It's time to make way for these three great ETFs in your retirement portfolio. Neha Chamaria, Steve Symington, and Jordan Wathen (Nehams) Jun 10, 2017 at 1:04PM Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are among the best ways to invest in stocks, especially for those who don't have time to research and monitor stocks and are generally risk-averse -- like retirees. In your golden years, you might also prefer investment tools that can supplement your retirement income without requiring you to put in extra effort. ETFs are a perfect fit, as they offer a passive way to own a basket of diversified stocks, and can be easily traded on stock exchanges. Depending on your risk/reward profiles and investing preferences, you can choose from a wide range of ETFs. For retired investors, our contributors believe that three top ETFs to go for are iShares Core Total USD Bond Market ETF (NYSEMKT:IUSB), Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEMKT:VYM), and Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT:VOO). Here's why. Boost your income with this high-yield dividend ETF Neha Chamaria (Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF): Dividend stocks are a great way to supplement retirement income, which is why my ETF pick for retirees also revolves around dividends. Among the several dividend ETFs, I believe Vanguard High Yield ETF, which comprises more than 400 high-yield dividend stocks and tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, deserves attention. Retirees can supplement their income with ETFs. Image source: Getty Images. There are several reasons why I believe this ETF is particularly well suited for retirees. For starters, more than 80% of its portfolio comprises large-cap stocks, eliminating much of the volatility and risk associated with small- or mid-cap stocks. Second, the ETF has near-equal weightage -- roughly 13% to 15% each -- in several key industries including consumer goods, technology, financials, healthcare, and industrials, which means it offers investors well-balanced exposure. Third, no single stock has more than mid-single-digit weightage -- Microsoft, currently the ETF's largest holding, comprises only about 5.5% of its total funds. Stocks like ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, and JPMorgan Chase make up between 3% and 4% each. Fourth, and most importantly, the ETF has a minuscule expense ratio of 0.08%, which means you're hardly paying anything extra to own the ETF. For retirees, every dollar saved counts. Given its focus on large-cap high yields, low cost, and strong historical performance -- the ETF has generated 96% in total returns over the past five decades -- I believe the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF is an excellent choice for retirees. Get more yield from a low-cost fund Jordan Wathen (iShares Core Total USD Bond Market): When you're drawing money from your retirement accounts, it becomes increasingly important to have fixed-income investments that produce more yield with less downside risk than stocks. The iShares Core Total USD Bond Market ETF is one of my favorite total bond-market funds because it is primarily invested in safe, AAA-rated securities (about 60% of the portfolio), with some yield enhancement from the roughly 9% of its portfolio held in bonds rated below investment grade. With an expense ratio of just 0.08% per year, it is less expensive to hold than a similar fixed-income position made up of a blend of an investment-grade ETF and a junk-bond ETF. With an average effective duration of 5.6 years, the ETF won't expose its investors to particularly large losses if rates continue to increase. The duration tells us that a 1-percentage-point move in rates would lead to a 5.6% increase or decrease in the value of the ETF. With a reasonable expense ratio and current yield of 2.5% per year, this ETF could be used for the entirety of a portfolio's bond exposure. A low-cost, easy-to-understand ETF Steve Symington (Vanguard S&P 500 ETF): As arguably the world's most widely followed stock-market index, the S&P 500 is hard to beat, with historical annual returns of roughly 10%. In fact, the overwhelming majority of actively managed equity funds and ETFs regularly underperform the popular benchmark. So if you'd rather not dedicate the time required for picking individual stocks during your retirement, but you still want to benefit from the wealth-generating machine that is our stock market, I think you should consider buying shares of the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF. Just like it sounds, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is designed to closely track the S&P 500's return. Because that means it's effectively comprised of 500 of the largest companies in the United States, you also shouldn't experience the same level of volatility as you might otherwise in picking a limited basket of stocks or a more specialized ETF. In addition -- and in keeping with Vanguard's propensity for offering products with ultra-low fees -- the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF boasts an expense ratio of just 0.04%, a small fraction of the already low industry-average ETF expense ratio of 0.28%. If you're investing a reasonably large sum of money early in your retirement, those fees (or lack thereof) can make an enormous difference in how much remains in your own pockets.

According to a research report published today, Blacks and Latinos are “severely underrepresented” among borrowers who obtained a loan from a major bank to purchase a home in the city of Oakland. The report, by the Greenlining Institute and Urban Strategies Council, also found that banks issued a much smaller total number of home mortgage loans in Oakland compared to Fresno and Long Beach, two other cities analyzed in the study. And Black and Latino borrowers in Oakland applied for home loans at very low rates, and were approved at lower rates than whites. This dearth in mortgage lending by major banks in Oakland, compounded by low numbers of mortgage loan applications from Black and Latino customers, and lower loan approval rates, is perpetuating and exacerbating wealth disparities, the authors of the study concluded. See also: JP Morgan Chase's Home Loans in Oakland Mostly Went to White and Wealthy Residents The study analyzed bank lending data for the year 2013 that was obtained from the federal government. The twelve largest banks, measured by the total dollar amount of loans originated in California, were included in the study. The authors compared Oakland, Fresno, and Long Beach because these cities are of similar size and have racially diverse populations, and they represent different geographic areas of the state with different economies. The data analyzed by the Greenlining Institute and Urban Strategies Council showed that major banks are making far fewer total mortgage loans in Oakland compared to Fresno and Long Beach. “Despite comparable populations, Oakland had less than one quarter as many loan applications and originations as Long Beach and Fresno,” the report states. It’s unclear why major banks are approving fewer home loans in Oakland, but it may be due to Oakland’s increasingly unaffordable prices, and the presence of cash investors who crowd out buyers who need bank loans to close a deal. Whatever the cause, this lower level of bank lending in Oakland is compounded by racial disparities. According to the report, Black and Latino residents make up 56 percent of Oakland’s total population, but they received just 10 percent of the total dollars lent by major banks for home purchases. “Across the board, what the report shows is that Black and Latino communities were way under-represented when it comes to obtaining mortgage loans,” said Zachary Murray of the Greenlining Institute, one of the authors of the report. Greenlining Institute and Urban Strategies Council found that in 2013 the top twelve banks only approved a total of four loans for Black borrowers to purchase homes in the city of Oakland. The other 44 home mortgage loans made to Black borrowers in Oakland were refinance loans. In the same year, Latinos only obtained sixty mortgage loans in Oakland, and just seven of these were to purchase a home. By contrast, white borrowers obtained 358 mortgage loans in 2013 and 40 of these were to purchase homes. Asians obtained 186 mortgage loans, and 37 of these were to buy a home. Particular banks exhibited wide racial disparities in their mortgage lending activities. According to the report, Wells Fargo Bank, US Bank, and CashCall all exhibited much lower loan origination rates for Blacks and Latinos than for Asians and whites. A loan origination rate measures what percent of applicants for a loan are approved and receive the loan. Some banks, including Chase and Bank of America did better, originating loans at almost equal rates for Black and Latino customers as they did for white and Asian customers. But for all of the twelve banks analyzed in the report, white and Asian customers were more likely to have their loans approved than Black and Latino customers. Sasha Werblin of Greenlining, one of the authors of the study, said that lower average household wealth and income could be one reason that Blacks and Latinos are less able to obtain home loans. The economic crisis and recession of 2007-2010, and the foreclosure crisis that peaked in 2011-2012 reduced the savings of many families, and had a disproportionately harmful impact on Black and Latino households in California. But Werblin said that it is also incumbent on banks to offer sustainable and quality financial products that help them build wealth and secure housing. “What are banks doing to market to these individuals? Do they have products that would fit the needs of these individuals?” said Weblin in a previous interview.

Keith Noreika, who represented lenders as a private lawyer, plans to recuse himself from matters related to JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc., firms the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulates.  Democratic lawmakers had already questioned whether Noreika’s close ties to the industry would prevent him from being an impartial watchdog. The ethics disclosure, released by the OCC Friday, lays out the scope of his potential conflicts for the first time.   “How can he possibly do his job when he can’t regulate these entities?” Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said in a Friday statement. “Not to mention the fact that he stands to profit from all of these relationships the moment he finishes his work at the OCC.” Trump Nominee Noreika became comptroller of the currency on a temporary basis last month, leaving his law practice to run the agency until a permanent leader is confirmed by the Senate. This week, President Donald Trump nominated Joseph Otting, a former lieutenant of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s at OneWest Bank, for the OCC post. Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up Noreika will follow all applicable federal ethics rules when he leaves government, said Bryan Hubbard, an OCC spokesman. That includes a permanent ban on representing banks before any agency if he dealt with an issue pertaining to the firm while at the OCC. Noreika will also be barred for two years from representing clients on matters that were “pending under his official responsibility during the last year of his federal service,” Hubbard said. In private practice, Noreika earned almost $3.3 million working at two law firms over the past 16 months or so, according to his financial disclosure form, which was also released Friday. His nearly 80 legal clients ranged from Wall Street banks to private equity firms to financial trade associations. The Trump administration’s decision to use an unusual personnel maneuver to name Noreika to the OCC post also has drawn scrutiny from Democrats, who are concerned that he isn’t following the same ethics rules as full-time officials. Noreika was appointed as a “special government employee,” a status meant for workers who are expected to serve for 130 days over the course of a year. Ethics Pledge Under the designation, which hasn’t traditionally been used to hire top regulators, Noreika doesn’t have to sign the ethics pledge that President Donald Trump requires of his appointees. The pledge includes a five-year lobbying ban for former officials. At the OCC, Noreika’s ethics agreement calls for him to stay away from specific matters, such as enforcement cases, and does not preclude him from participating in broader policy decisions that would impact his former clients. It requires Noreika to recuse himself for one year from the date he last worked for the client. That means some of his recusals have already ended. For example, Noreika was precluded from issues involving Wells Fargo & Co. until May 18. His restriction on Bank of America will end July 26, and Citigroup lapses on Sept. 30, according to the form. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. were more recent clients and Noreika will be recused from matters involving them until the next spring, if he is still at the agency.

Photo: Reuters/Jonathan Ernst United StatesBusinessOpinion Dear President Trump: Breaking up (banks) isn’t so hard to do In 66 years as law, the Glass-Steagall Act effectively prevented systemic banking and economic collapse and it's revival is well overdue By Nomi Prins June 10, 2017 8:53 AM (UTC+8) Share Tweet Linkedin Print Email Share 0 Comment 0 Donald, listen, whatever you’ve done so far, whatever you’ve messed up, there’s one thing you could do that would make up for a lot.  It would be huge!  Terrific!  It could change our world for the better in a big-league way!  It could save us all from economic disaster!  And it isn’t even hard to grasp or complicated to do.  It’s simple, in fact.  Reinstitute the Glass-Steagall Act. Let me explain. In the world of romance, if you break up with someone, it’s pretty simple (emotional complications aside).  You’re just not together anymore. In the world of financial regulation, it used to be as simple as that, too. It was like installing a traffic light at a dangerous intersection to avoid deaths. In 1933, when the Glass-Steagall Act was passed, it helped break up the biggest banks of the day and for good reason: they had had a major hand in triggering the most disastrous economic depression our country ever experienced. Certain divisions of those banks were no longer allowed to coexist with others. The law split the parts of banks that placed bets by creating and trading certain risky securities and those that took deposits and provided loans.  In other words, it ensured that the investment bank and the commercial bank would no longer cohabit. Put another way, it separated bankers with a heinous gambling habit from those who only wanted a secure nest egg. It was simplicity itself. Photo: Kurtis Garbutt via Flickr After 1933, the gamblers and savers went their separate ways, which proved a boon for the economy and the financial system for nearly seven decades. Then legislators, lobbyists, bankers, and regulators started to chisel away at the wall separating those two kinds of banks. By November 1999, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that repealed the Glass-Steagall Act totally. The abusive marriages of gamblers and savers could once again be consummated. And who doesn’t remember the result: the financial crisis of 2007-2008 that led to taxpayer-funded bailouts, subsidies, loans, and sweetheart fraud-settlement deals. Just as the Crash of 1929 had been catalyzed by the manufacturing of shady “trusts” stuffed with shady securities, this crisis was enabled by the big banks that engineered complex assets stuffed with subprime mortgages and other loans that were sold around the world.  Former US President Barack Obama delivers his keynote speech to the Montreal Chamber of Commerce at the Palais de Congres in Quebec. Photo: Reuters/Dario Ayala Under President Obama, the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. The Act sought to limit the ability of big banks to trade the riskiest types of securities. Through inclusion of something called the “Volcker Rule,” Dodd-Frank prohibited the trading of securities (even if with many loopholes). What it didn’t do was actually break up the big banks again.  That meant another 1933 still awaited its moment.  Then along came the bizarre 2016 presidential election campaign during which, strangely enough, Democrats and Republicans found one issue on which they had some common ground: the banking system.  Key figures in both parties agreed that it was time to stop the investment bank and the commercial bank from commingling. Bernie Sanders ran on a campaign to break up the banks – and so did Donald Trump. At at an October campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, Trump even stated, “It’s time for a twenty-first-century Glass-Steagall.” The Democratic National Committee platform offered a similar message. “Banks,” it said, “should not be able to gamble with taxpayers’ deposits or pose an undue risk to Main Street. Democrats support a variety of ways to stop this from happening, including an updated and modernized version of Glass-Steagall as well as breaking up too-big-to-fail financial institutions that pose a systemic risk to the stability of our economy.” The Republican National Committee wasted even fewer words making the point in their platform: “We support reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which prohibits commercial banks from engaging in high-risk investment.” And it didn’t even suggest that the act should be “modernized” or mention a “21st century” version that didn’t do what the 20th century one had done. For the first time since its repeal, in other words, a return to the Glass-Steagall Act had bipartisan support. It couldn’t have been simpler, right? Two parties, one idea: split banks into two pieces. But then, as if you hadn’t already guessed, it got complicated.   Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner, waivers on supporting the return of the Glass-Steagall Act. Photo: Reuters/Joshua Roberts Breaking up, Republican style In the new administration, two key figures are now offering quite different and conflicting views of what a resurrection of the Glass-Steagall Act might mean.  At his Senate confirmation hearings, Steven Mnuchin, former Goldman Sachs partner and Trump’s nominee to be secretary of the Treasury, faced Democrat Senator Maria Cantwell (Washington) as she bluntly asked “Do you support returning to Glass-Steagall?” He replied, “I don’t support going back to Glass-Steagall as is. What we’ve talked about with the president-elect is perhaps we need a 21st century Glass-Steagall. But, no, I don’t support… taking a very old law and say we should adhere to it as is.” Cantwell then pressed him further: “And so, is that the position of what the Republican platform was? Because I thought it was Glass-Steagall?” To this, Mnuchin responded, “Again, the Republican platform did pass at the convention Glass-Steagall and… [when] we talked about policy with the president-elect, our view is we need a 21st century Glass-Steagall.” The skepticism in the room was thick enough to cut with a knife. Here, after all, was a man who had made windfall profits on the fallout from the 2007-2008 “too big to fail” financial crisis by organizing a cadre of hedge-fund billionaires to buy the collapsed IndyMac Bank at a discount. He then proceeded to foreclose on some of its mortgages and resell it for a US$2.5 billion profit. Why should such a man want to restrict banking activity, Glass-Steagall-style, when his loan practices had allowed him to make a fortune off the taxpayer bailouts that were the result of not doing so? What would the point be when a crisis, as history had just shown, forced the federal government to subsidize risk and failure? The only problem he faced: the Republican platform said he should.   Last month, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee and under questioning from Senator Elizabeth Warren, he backtracked even further: “The president said we do support a ’21st-century Glass-Steagall,’ that means there are aspects of it that we think may make sense. But we never said before we support a full separation of banks and investment banking.” Warren responded incredulously, “Tell me what 21st-century Glass-Steagall means if it doesn’t mean breaking up those two parts. It’s an easy question.” Mnuchin replied, “It’s actually a complicated question… We never said we were in favor of Glass-Steagall. We said we were in favor of a 21st-century Glass-Steagall. It couldn’t be clearer.”  Which, of course, couldn’t have been murkier. Director of the White House National Economic Council Gary Cohn (left) generally favors a return to when banks were split between those which placed bets to those which took deposits. Photo: Reuters/Joshua Roberts And then there’s that other former Goldman Sachs man, Gary Cohn, Trump’s director of the National Economic Council.  He had quite a different Glass-Steagall tale to tell Senator Warren. According to Bloomberg News, he insisted that he “generally favors banking going back to how it was when firms like Goldman focused on trading and underwriting securities, and companies such as Citigroup primarily issued loans.” That sounds a lot like breaking up the banks. This division and the as-yet unresolved nature of the Trump administration response to the Glass-Steagall question could, in the face of another financial crisis, come back to haunt us all, if it translates into more bailouts and systemic failures. The Democrats’ Dilemma As with the proverbial difficulty of chewing gum and walking at the same time, certain Democrats seem to find the very idea of supporting both Dodd-Frank and a new Glass-Steagall Act perplexing. Many of them have promoted the idea that no big bank actually failed in the Great Recession moment (which was true only because those banks got huge infusions of federal aid to remain solvent).  As a result, they avoided all responsibility for the way the repeal of Glass-Steagall allowed too-big-to-fail banks to come into existence in the first place.  In the process, they also conveniently ignored the way the big banks lent money to, or funded, the investment banks that did fail like both of my former employers, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. Without those loans or that funding, those outfits couldn’t have purchased the overload of toxic assets that, in the end, imploded the whole system. President Obama summed up this position when he told Rolling Stone in 2012, “I’ve looked at some of Rolling Stone’s articles that say, ‘This didn’t go far enough, we didn’t institute Glass-Steagall’ and so forth, and I pushed my economic team very hard on some of those questions. “But there is not evidence that having Glass-Steagall in place would somehow change the dynamic. Lehman Brothers wasn’t a commercial bank; it was an investment bank. AIG wasn’t an FDIC-insured bank; it was an insurance institution. So the problem in today’s financial sector can’t be solved simply by re-imposing models that were created in the 1930s.”  He needed a more astute team. Hillary Clinton took a similar tack in her campaign and it may have contributed to her devastating election loss.  The continued promotion of such fallacies does not bode well for the future of the party if it continues to adopt that view. A return to a safer system on the other hand, would be more populist – and far more popular. Glass-Steagall’s bipartisan past Fortunately, current legislation is circulating in Congress that would promote the long-term stability of the financial system by restoring Glass-Steagall for real. H.R. 790 (“Return to the Prudent Banking Act of 2017”) is one of two reinstatement bills in the House of Representatives. It has 50 co-sponsors from both parties and its passage is being spearheaded by Democrat Marcy Kaptur (Ohio) and Republican Walter Jones (North Carolina).   The second bill, H.R. 2585, sponsored by Democrat Mike Capuano (Massachussetts), bears a close relationship to Senate bill S.881 (the “Twenty-First-Century Glass-Steagall Act of 2017”), sponsored by Democrat Elizabeth Warren (Massachussetts) and nine cosponsors including Republican John McCain (Arizona), and independents Maria Cantwell (Washington) and Angus King (Maine). Either of the bills, if enacted, would do the same thing: break up the banks. To understand just why passage is so crucial, a little history is in order.  Glass-Steagall, or the Banking Act of 1933, was signed into law by President Franklin D Roosevelt. It represented a bipartisan effort and was even – perhaps not surprisingly given the devastating nature of the collapse of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed – actively promoted by some of Wall Street’s most powerful bankers. In its 66 years as law, it effectively prevented systemic banking and economic collapse. Outgoing president Herbert Hoover (left) with Franklin D Roosevelt on his inauguration day in 1933. Photo: Wikimedia Commons Even before Roosevelt began his first term, congressional Republicans had initiated an investigation into bankers’ practices.  In early 1933, as Roosevelt was preparing to take office with an incoming Democratic Senate, outgoing Senate Banking and Currency Committee chairman Peter Norbeck, a Republican from South Dakota, hired former New York Deputy District Attorney Ferdinand Pecora to lead the Senate Banking Committee in a new investigation. Later known as the Pecora hearings, they would shed light on the kinds of financial manipulations by unscrupulous bankers that had led to the crash of 1929. They would also provide the new president with the necessary populist political capital to enact America’s most sweeping financial reforms. No less crucial was the way banking leaders aligned themselves with Roosevelt’s new program. Duty to country over balance sheets seemed then to be the order of the day, even on Wall Street.  (It’s not an attitude that lasted into the 21st century.) Two days after his inauguration, for instance, Roosevelt invited incoming National City Bank Chairman James Perkins to the White House for a secret meeting. The next day, under Perkins’ direction, his bank board passed a resolution splitting apart its trading and deposit-taking divisions. Chase National Bank chairman Winthrop Aldrich, a major financial power player, lent a hand as well. Both Perkins and Aldrich would back the new Glass-Steagall bill. (Lest you think that all was sweetness and light, they were also convinced that it would diminish the strength of their main competitor, the Morgan Bank.) Three days after Roosevelt called Perkins to the White House, Aldrich’s views on breaking up the banks hit the front page of the New York Times when he announced that Chase National Bank and Chase Securities Corporation would become separate entities, effectively enforcing the bill before it even became law. It wasn’t simple – the Chase Securities Corporation was the biggest of its kind in the world – but it happened. Aldrich then took part in a series of private meetings with the president at the White House about the pending legislation. Without the support of Aldrich and Perkins, it’s possible that the bill wouldn’t have passed. After all, a far weaker version proposed during the previous administration of Herbert Hoover hadn’t. The Glass-Steagall Act also created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to insure citizens’ bank deposits. This left commercial banks with a choice to make. If they took deposits and made loans, they could not speculate with depositors’ money. If they wanted to create and speculate, they were on their own. There’s much to be said for protecting hard-working Americans in this fashion. US President Ronald Reagan. Photo: Wikimedia Commons How the walls came tumbling down In the 1980s, the walls between investment and commercial banking first began to crumble.  The deregulation of the financial sector that followed would prove to be as bipartisan as the passage of Glass-Steagall had been.  In 1982, as the Republican presidency of Ronald Reagan began, Congress passed the Garn-St Germain Act, deregulating the kinds of investments that savings and loan banks could make to include riskier real estate loans. This had the effect of exacerbating the savings and loan debacle, which hit its pinnacle in the late 1980s. By 1989, more than 1,000 S&L banks in the US would crash and burn. In total, the crisis wound up costing about US$160 billion, US$132 billion of which was footed by taxpayers. And the suppliers of risky S&L securities tended to be the big banks. In 1987, still in the age of Reagan, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, a past board member of JPMorgan, said that non-bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies could sell or hold “bank ineligible securities” – that is, securities prohibited by Glass-Steagall, including mortgage securities, asset-backed securities, junk bonds, and other derivative products.   The move exacerbated the S&L crisis, but it also offered an avenue for commercial banks to stock up on some of the securities at the heart of that crisis. And so commercial banks began investing in hedge funds, whose very purpose in life is to gamble on securities, stocks, and commodities.  In 1998, in an early warning of what the future might hold, one of them, Long Term Capital Management, crashed and nearly brought down the whole financial system with it. Some 55 commercial banks had invested in it using depositors’ money to back their bets.  Only an emergency meeting of the presidents of the major banks at the Federal Reserve averted a larger economic meltdown, but because Glass-Steagall was still in place, they had to figure out how to save themselves.  No government bailouts were forthcoming. Wall Street plunged deeper into financial deregulation in 1999. Photo: iStock Having narrowly avoided disaster, Wall Street only plunged deeper into financial deregulation. In 1999, Glass-Steagall itself was repealed. On December 21, 2000, Congress passed the Commodity Futures Modernization Act deregulating derivatives trading.  The big commercial banks then merged with investment banks, insurance companies, and brokerage firms.  By 2007, the assets of those big banks had tripled. The four largest – Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo – by then controlled (and still control) more than half the assets of the banking system. In the autumn of 2007, that system finally started buckling because of the problems of Citigroup, not because of the investment banks, which would not have been covered by Glass-Steagall. The catastrophe that hit Citigroup makes it clear just how crucial the repeal of that act was to the financial meltdown to come. Citigroup would “require” a taxpayer-financed bailout of US$45 billion, US$340 billion in asset guarantees, and US$2 trillion in near-0% Federal Reserve loans between the autumn of 2007 and 2010. That in itself was staggering and Citigroup wasn’t alone. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke would later testify that, by 2008, 11 out of the 12 biggest commercial banks were “insolvent” and had to be bailed out.  The entire banking system was rotten to the core and the massive buildup of bad paper, high leverage, and speculative bets (derivatives) that made disaster inevitable can be traced directly back to the repeal of Glass-Steagall.  Today, a fresh bubble is inflating. This time, it’s not US subprime mortgages at the heart of a budding banking crisis, but US$51 trillion in corporate debt in the form of bonds, loans, and related derivatives. The credit ratings agency S&P Global Ratings has predicted that such debt could rise to US$75 trillion by 2020 and the defaults on it are starting to increase in pace. Banks have profited by the short-term creation and trading of this corporate debt, propagating even greater risk. Should that bubble burst, it could make the subprime mortgage bubble of 2007 look like a relatively small-scale event.   Source: Wikimedia Commons What Will the President Do? On the positive side, there’s a growing bipartisan alliance in Congress and outside it on restoring Glass-Steagall. This increasingly wide-ranging consensus reaches from the AFL-CIO to the libertarian Mises Institute, in the Senate from John McCain to Elizabeth Warren and Maria Cantwell, and in the House of Representatives from Republicans Walter Jones and Mike Coffman to Democrats Marcy Kaptur, Bernie Sanders, and Tulsi Gabbard.  In fact, just this week, Kaptur and Jones announced an amendment to the pending Financial Choice Act in the House of Representatives, that would represent the first genuine attempt to bring to a vote the possibility of resurrecting the Glass-Steagall Act since its repeal. So, Donald, here’s the question: Where do you – the man who, in the course of a few weeks, embraced Middle Eastern autocrats, turned relations with key Nato allies upside down, and to the astonishment of much of the world, withdrew the US from the Paris climate agreement – stand? In just a few months in office, you’ve turned the White House into an outpost for your family business, but when it comes to the financial well-being of the rest of us, what will you do? Will you, in fact, protect us from another future meltdown of the financial system? It wouldn’t be that hard and you were clear enough on this issue in your election campaign, but does that even matter to you today? I noticed that recently, in an Oval Office interview with Bloomberg News, when asked about breaking up the banks, you said, “I’m looking at that right now. There’s some people that want to go back to the old system, right? So we’re going to look at that.” Your party and your own appointees are split on the subject.  Where will you fall?  You could still commit yourself to securing the financial well-being of our nation for generations to come.  You could commit yourself to Glass-Steagall.  The question is: Will you?  Nomi Prins, a TomDispatch regular, is the author of six books.

Print this article This year’s exams took place on 3 June, and saw a nine per cent increase in registrations globally compared to June 2016. The growth in candidates shows a strong demand for investment education rooted in ethics and is a testament to the increasing focus on raising standards, improving professionalism and putting client interests first. The Middle East had a strong representation from investment professionals in the region choosing the CFA as the qualification of choice: a total of 4,451 investment professionals from 12 Middle East countries reaffirmed their commitment to the highest level of professionalism by enrolling for the CFA exams across Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Palestinian Territory, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. “The CFA charter is the most rigorous credential in the investment profession, and represents the technical skills, knowledge, and commitment to ethics that future professionals need to succeed. When investors place their trust in CFA charter holders, they can achieve peace of mind knowing that they are in the hands of professionals with the expertise and integrity to meet their investment goals and put their interests first,” said Paul Smith, CFA, president and CEO of CFA Institute. Regionally, the Asia Pacific region continues to be the largest source of candidates, with 90,290 registered for the June 2017 exam, accounting for 48 per cent of the total. The Americas region saw the registration of 58,549 candidates, 31 per cent of the total, and 40,076 candidates registered in Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), accounting for 21 per cent of the total. CFA Institute currently has more than 142,000 charterholders who work in some of the most prominent firms around the world, including BNY Mellon, JP Morgan Chase, PwC, HSBC, and State Street. Employers know that by hiring charterholders, teams are strengthened with professionals who have an in-depth understanding of client needs, and the capacity to tailor and implement specific solutions.   The CFA curriculum is grounded in the practice of the investment profession and is methodically updated with knowledge, skills, and competencies that are relevant to the profession. The three-level self-study programme covers topics including Ethical and Professional Standards, Quantitative Methods, Economics, Financial Reporting and Analysis, Corporate Finance, Investment Tools, Asset Classes, and Portfolio Management and Wealth Planning.   Each level of the CFA Programme imparts a particular skill set: Level I is focused on investment tools and the foundations of the business, giving candidates the necessary knowledge and comprehension; Level II is focused on asset classes including equity investments, fixed income, derivatives, and alternative investments, emphasising candidates’ ability in application and analysis; and Level III is focused on portfolio management and wealth planning, requiring candidates to be competent in synthesis and evaluation while making investment decisions.  The CFA exam comes on the heels of the organisation largest global gathering, the CFA Institute 70th Annual Conference, held on 21 to 24 May in Philadelphiaspan style="color: #0000ff; font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">. At the event, Smith invited an audience of more than 1,800 professionals from 70 countries to commit to higher standards and help make the system work for all investors. In a wide-ranging speech that addressed issues that Smith described as “existential”, he called on members of CFA Institute to take the lead in raising professionalism to a new level. “We all like to say we put our clients first, but it is not enough to proclaim a formal fiduciary commitment to them. We have to live up to that fiduciary standard every day and our clients and investors have to believe that we do,” Smith said. “I want us to stand even more vigorously and vocally for candour and transparency.”    In his address, Smith outlined four steps that investment management professionals must take to make the profession more trustworthy and reinforce its value. These are: revising business models, taking the lead in earning trust, recruiting the right kind of professionals, and adapting to new technology.   “The fundamental purpose of finance is to contribute to society through increases in societal wealth and well-being. We need more people in our professional ranks who have clear ethics and a sense of commitment, people who see this career as a way to do a lot of good,” Smith said. “We also need more diversity in our ranks. Not just gender, but other diversity dimensions such as ethnicity, culture and work style.”        Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

While some countries like Bolivia, Ecuador and Bangladesh have banned bitcoins, Australia and Japan are regulating it. Today, there are almost 750 cryptocurrencies with a capitalisation of more than $104 billion. And a small but determined number of startups in India are making early moves in a market that is yet to be recognised by the government. Sandeep Goenka had started two companies before he decided to set up Zebpay along with Saurabh Agrawal and Mahin Gupta. Drawn to bitcoins, they immersed themselves in research. In 2014, they attended a conference in the US which gave them insights into the future of bitcoins. “We started as a Bitcoin wallet and expected people’s interest to be low, but every time we set targets, we surpassed them,” said Goenka. When they met investors in 2015, there was apprehension but a year later, the founders raised close to $1 million in a Series A round led by equity investor Arjun Handa, CMD and VP of Claris Life Sciences and Amit Jindal, MD of Jindal Worldwide. Zebpay has 7 lakh users and is adding a lakh every month. The startup is now looking to expand to Southeast Asia. When Sathvik Vishwanath set up Unocoin along with Sunny Ray, Harish B V and Abhinand Kaseti, they believed in Bitcoin as the future of money despite the apprehensions surrounding cryptocurrencies in India. “Technology always precedes regulation. There were no cab-sharing guidelines before Uber. It is after the disruption and its impact on lives that the government has to look into the issues and decide if it needs regulation,” said Vishwanath. What could have led to the increasing acceptance of bitcoins is the surge in its value. From the beginning of 2017, bitcoins have touched an all-time high. In January, the currency crossed $1,000 for the first time in three years. Last month, it crossed $1500, becoming more valuable than gold, which has not touched $1500 in the last four years. Earlier this week, the combined market capitalisation of cryptocurrencies crossed $100 billion. Vishwanath says the surge in prices has helped garner users, adding that Unocoin has 2.7 lakh users. In August 2016, the startup raised funding of $1.5 million in a Pre Series-A round from multiple investors including Blume Ventures, Mumbai Angels and Ah! Ventures along with Digital Currency Group, Boost VC, Bank to the Future, Bitcoin Capital and FundersClub. For Blume Ventures, bitcoins presented a rare opportunity. “Bitcoin has the ability to transform the way we look at money. When we made the investment, we didn’t know that this sector would become so hot. India has a large unbanked population, and is on its way to becoming digitised. With the possibilities this technology brings in cross-border remittances, it seemed like a natural reason for us to invest in a company dealing with bitcoins,” said Arpit Agarwal, Blume Ventures. Hesham Rehman was a bitcoin trader for four years before he set up Bitxoxo with Mohammed Rizwan. It now has almost 10,000 users, and the founders are in talks with investors to expand their presence. An equity and commodities trader himself, Siva Kameshwara Rao was exposed to bitcoins when he was trading in forex markets. Rao set up BTCX in 2014 but has not limited himself to bitcoins. With ethexindia, Rao has introduced the next digital currency, Ether or Ethereum, to the Indian market. “We have niche users. While bitcoins account for over 40% of the cryptocurrency market, if the current trend continues, it will be Ethereum that will take the number 1 spot,” said Rao, who has seed investment from a Europe based investor. Rao’s focus on Ethereum is in line with the global backing that the currency is receiving. In February, global behemoths Microsoft, Accenture, Intel, JPMorgan and a dozen other banks and companies formed an alliance around the cryptocurrency. Just last month, Indian IT major Wipro joined the alliance. While cryptocurrencies have caught the attention of many in India, the lack of clarity in regulations has raised concerns. RBI has issued warnings on usage of bitcoins. In a bid to create a self-regulatory mechanism, Zebpay, Unocoin, Coinsecure and Searchtrade launched Digital Asset and Blockchain Foundation of India (DABFI) in February. “We are working on a draft set of regulations and it should be ready in a few months,” said Vishwanath of Unocoin. Experts in blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin, have their own reservations given the hacks it has been subjected to. In August 2010 hackers exploited a vulnerability and generated billions of bitcoins. Mt Gox and Bitomat, two of the largest bitcoin exchanges at the time, suffered massive security breaches in 2011. A couple of years later, Instawallet, a web-based wallet provider, shut down after it lost 35,000 bitcoins. “Many people believe that bitcoins are un-hackable. But that’s not true. Multi-million dollar hacks have targeted an Australian Bitcoin wallet provider (Inputs.io), a Chinese cryptocurrency exchange (Bter), a Slovenian exchange (Bitstamp), a Hong-Kong-based exchange (Bitfinex). Bitcoin has also seen its fair share of multi-million dollar frauds such as Global Bond Limited and Cryptsy,” said Rohas Nagpal, cofounder, Primechain Technologies. Nagpal believes bitcoins are just another way to gamble in the hope of making a lot of money in a short time with minimal effort. “The current bitcoin price rise is a massive pump-and-dump scheme which will see millions of people lose a lot of money while a few will rake in billions of dollars in profits,” he said.

Moody’s cut the nation’s foreign and local-currency ratings to Baa 3, and kept the outlook at negative, meaning the next move could be to speculative grade. The company cited weakening institutions, reduced growth prospects and the resultant risks to the country’s finances as reasons for the change in a statement on Friday. “The risks to growth and fiscal strength arising from the political outlook are tilted to the downside,” Moody’s said. “It is unlikely that a political consensus will emerge, which supports investment in the economy and reinvigorates the reform effort sufficiently quickly to reverse the expected negative impact on growth and on the government’s balance sheet.” S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings Ltd cut their foreign-currency assessments of South Africa to junk in April after President Jacob Zuma on changed his cabinet and fired Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan. The decision sent the rand and bonds plunging, and sparked street demonstrations pushing for Zuma’s ouster and opposition parties to call for a no-confidence vote in parliament. Several top leaders in the ruling African National Congress have said the party risks losing power in 2019 elections if he’s allowed to complete his second five-year term. It will hold a policy conference at the end of this month and will elect a new leader in December, when Zuma’s second five-term term as ANC president ends. “Moody’s views the underlying political dynamics which led to the March cabinet reshuffle as posing a threat to near- and medium-term real gross domestic product growth,” the company said. “The institutional framework has become less transparent, effective and predictable, and policymakers’ commitment to previously articulated reform objectives is less certain.” Junk Status South Africa’s economy unexpectedly fell into a recession for the first time since 2009 in the three month through March as all but two industries shrank, the statistics office said June 6. “The outcomes of the conferences of the ANC in June and December 2017 are not expected to translate to policy changes,” the National Treasury said in an emailed statement. Policy transparency and continuity are top priorities for the government and the ruling party, it said. Moody’s is the only major credit-rating company to assess both South Africa’s foreign-currency and rand-denominated debt at investment grade. S&P cut the nation’s foreign-currency debt to junk on April 3 and left the local rating one step above. Fitch reduced both assessments to junk four days later, triggering a sell-off by some investors tracking investment-grade debt indexes. JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in April it would remove the nation’s dollar-denominated debt from gauges tracked by $59 billion of funds. The bulk of investments in global index-tracking funds remains safe because about 90 per cent of the country’s debt portfolio is rand-denominated. S&P affirmed South Africa’s foreign-currency debt at the highest junk assessment, and rand-denominated bonds at the lowest investment grade on June 2. Fitch maintained both its ratings at the highest non-investment grade on June 1. Moody’s said it could cut the South Africa’s rating further if there are indications that the strength and independence of the country’s institutions have diminished more or if policy becomes more unpredictable. “Unless government is able to meaningfully encourage private-sector investment, which leads to higher economic growth and an improvement in government finances, Moody’s will be forced to downgrade South Africa to below investment grade,” Kevin Lings, the chief economist at Stanlib Asset Management Ltd in Johannesburg, said in an emailed note. “Such a move would have very significant implications for South Africa’s ability to attract sufficient foreign investment cost-effectively and on a sustained basis.” More from Economy Dubai business improves, but growth slows Puerto Rico may grab sales taxes at heart of row ‘WGES 2017’ to commence on October 24 Mnuchin plays nice with Canada South Africa escapes junk at Moody’s UK’s fragile coalition muddies economic outlook Ethiopia eyes role in DP World’s Somaliland port Blockade vexes Qatar’s World Cup projects tags from this storyJacob Zuma follow this tag on MGNSouth Africa follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessEconomy tagsJacob Zuma follow this tag on MGN+ MGNSouth Africa follow this tag on MGN+ MGNab de villiers Also In EconomyUAE ranked 12th for foreign investments Business Gallery China Beijing International High-tech Expo opens Pictures: Apple launches new gadgets and updates Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosGalleries 01Dubai business improves, but growth slows 02UAE salary guide 2015: Are you getting enough? 03Ethiopia eyes role in DP World’s Somaliland port Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Play Take an onboard tour of the QE2 in Dubai Jan 10, 2012 7Images China Beijing International High-tech Expo opens Jun 08, 2017 8Images Pictures: Apple Store in Abu Dhabi Oct 27, 2015 13Images Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project May 15, 2017 8Images Massive development at Abu Dhabi airport Mar 11, 2017 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News CCTV footage of Abu Dhabi killer released Emirati-Qatari families to get assistance Expats in this country will pay monthly tax Countries to prosecute Qatar for terror support UAE hopes Qatar finally seeing sense 3 Pakistani men and their 96 children UAE calls on Qatar to end support to terror UAE blacklist may hit liquidity of Qatari banks New parking rates upset Marina Square residents Close Recommended For You A pre-teen queen with ‘rain-making’ powersPUBLISHED ON Jun 11, 2017 South Africa appoints Mogajane as treasury DGPUBLISHED ON Jun 08, 2017 UAE hopes Qatar finally seeing sense PUBLISHED ON Jun 11, 2017 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

(Michael Brochstein/Sipa USA/TNS) Renae Merle, the Washington Post Jun 9, 2017 at 8:31 pm | Print View Goldman Sachs faced a looming deadline in July. Under new federal rules, the storied Wall Street bank was required to rid itself of about $6 billion in risky investments, such as stakes in hedge funds, that regulators fear could hamper it during an economic downturn. But by late last year, Goldman had yet to find a buyer and appealed to the Federal Reserve for a reprieve. The agency gave Goldman and several other banks five more years to comply with the rules put in place in response to the 2008 financial crisis. Now, it appears, Goldman may be able to keep those investments after all. Republican lawmakers passed legislation in the House this week that would do away with the requirement all together. It is part of a sweeping plan to ease banking industry rules they argue have been hampering the economy and made it more difficult to get a loan. The effort, backed by the Trump administration, aims to dismantle major portions of the Obama administration’s 2010 financial reform law, known as the Dodd Frank Act, landmark legislation that forced banks to maintain a larger financial cushion and take on less debt. “Congratulations to Jeb Hensarling & Republicans on successful House vote to repeal major parts of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law. GROWTH!,” President Donald Trump said in a tweet Friday morning. (Rep. Hensarling, a Republican from Texas, shepherded the legislation.) Supporters touted the rules as a chance to help community and regional banks, many of which struggle to comply with a regulatory regime aimed mostly at the biggest banks. But the big banks would also gain relief, and one of the key ways is the proposed elimination of a provision known as the “Volcker rule.” The rule, named after its chief champion, former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, has two prongs. The first limits banks’ ability to buy and sell exotic financial instruments, and the second limits the ability of banks to operate and invest in hedge funds and private-equity funds. Banks that make loans and collect consumer deposits, such as checking and savings accounts, shouldn’t be using that money to take on the same type of risks that hedge funds do, supporters of the rule say. But House Republicans argued that the Volcker has sapped liquidity from the markets - in other words, reduced the number of institutional buyers and sellers - and said in a summary of the legislation that repealing the rule would “promote more resilient capital markets and a more stable financial system.” To comply, big Wall Street banks have shut down their “proprietary trading” desks to eliminate speculative trades and began selling off their investments in hedge and private equity funds. The shift was particularly significant for Goldman, which once claimed that such proprietary trading accounted for 10 percent of its revenue. In an CNBC interview earlier this year, Goldman chief executive Lloyd Blankfein said restrictions on bank trading could prevent companies from being involved in the kinds of transactions that are “beneficial to the financial markets. There should be more flexibility.” Many in the industry complain that the regulations governing the Volcker rule are so complex it made it difficult to distinguish between the financial transactions a bank may do on its own behalf, purely for profit, or on behalf of a client. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, once warned that “for every trader, we are going to have to have a lawyer, compliance officer, doctor to see what their testosterone levels are, and a shrink - what is your intent?” Some regulators have acknowledged the complexity of the rules, though critics say banks are exaggerating. “Proprietary trading had banks with conflicts of interest against their customers,” Volcker said in an interview. “The idea that the restraint on proprietary trading is hurting customer service is baloney.” In the meantime, big banks have received two extensions to comply with aspects of the rule, the first in 2015. The latest covers “illiquid funds,” typically investments banks made in hedge and private funds that may now be difficult to sell. “I have doubts over the need for an extension. How much of it is just a hope that the rule would go away?,” Volcker said. The extension gave Goldman more time to rid itself of about $6 billion in investments. Morgan Stanley has applied for more time to deal with about $1.9 billion of such assets. Citigroup only has about $400 million left and has also been granted an extension. The bank’s chief executive, Michael Corbat, said at a banking conference earlier this month that it was time to make changes to Volcker. “We don’t want to be in the proprietary trading business. We don’t want to be using consumer deposits to speculate,” he said. But the law is too complex, Corbat said, noting that the rules had been written by five different agencies. Those agencies “have taken the same law, the same rule and applied it five different ways. And what we’ve said is we don’t care which one, just pick one of them. Pick one of them and enforce it that way, and we’d be great with that.” The House legislation that would repeal the rule all together is unlikely to pass the Senate intact and regulators, who already spent years wiring the rules, may shy away from making significant, time-consuming changes. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker who has been directed by Trump to make recommendations on improving the banking system, appears to be leaning toward a compromise. “I support the Volcker Rule, but there needs to be proper definition around the Volcker Rule so banks can understand what they can do and what they can’t do,” Mnuchin told the Senate Banking Committee in January. The effort to repeal or even weaken the rule has outraged some. “The Volcker firewall was among the most critical pieces of Wall Street reform,” said Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon), one of the original sponsors of the provision. “This casino allowed banks to make big bets with taxpayer-insured funds, destabilizing the financial system and the U.S. economy.” But a repeal of the rule could pay off for big banks. Wall Street banks stand to recoup about $2 billion in profits next year if the trading restrictions were lifted, according to research by Nomura, a global investment bank. That includes a boost of about $446 million for Goldman. Like what you're reading?

Continue Reading Below While some investors see bargains in lower valuations of regional banks' shares, few can point with any confidence to near-term catalysts for a turnaround in their fortunes. After outperforming larger banks in the wake of the Nov. 8 U.S. Presidential election, the S&P 600 index of small cap banks are down 8.1 percent so far this year, data through Thursday showed, while the S&P 500 index of the biggestU.S. banks is unchanged. The full S&P 500, meanwhile, is up 8.7 percent. Last year, investors bet heavily that smaller, entirely U.S.-focused banks would benefit most from Donald Trump's promises of tax cuts, deregulation and economic stimulus. But those hopes dwindled dramatically as it became clear that President Trump would have difficulty gaining enough support to deliver on any of his pro-growth proposals. "I would expect (smaller banks) to continue to underperform as long as we don't get some of these policy decisions to move through," said Stephen Scouten, banking analyst for Sandler O’Neill in Atlanta. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Fading hopes for an economic boost from Trump's agenda has compressed the gap between short- and long-term interest rates, putting pressure on bank loan profit margins. This is a bigger issue for regionals which have a greater dependence on lending for their profits than bigger, more diversified banks. Also, commercial and industrial loan growth has slowed this year after climbing steadily since late 2010. The Federal Reserve's latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, released May 8, showed domestic banks reporting weaker commercial and industrial loan demand from firms of all sizes in the firstquarter.   WAITING FOR CLARITY Part of the problem is that companies are waiting for clarity on economic growth prospects and tax rates before making borrowing decisions, according to investors and analysts. "Eventually, for the smaller banks to outperform, concerns about the overall economy need to dissipate. Better economic growth usually leads to better lending growth and in that environment the yield curve steepens as well," said Brian Kleinhanzl, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. Short selling has decreased in most regional and diversified banking sectors so far this year. But short interest in both the SPDR S&P Bank Exchange Traded Fund and SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF increased as short sellers may be replacing exposure to individual banks with short bets on the sector. Short interest in the S&P bank ETF is up 36 percent for the year while it is up 23 percent in the regional banking ETF. While tax cuts are viewed as one of the biggest boosts for regional banks of all Trump's policy proposals, investors are skeptical it will come any time soon. JPMorgan analysts on Thursday scaled back their forecast on the size of possible U.S. tax cuts and pushed out the timing to the second quarter of 2018 from the third quarter of 2017. White House economic adviser Gary Cohn has said he expects U.S. Congress to get tax reform done this year. But investors say 2018 would likely be the earliest this could happen. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected this month to unveil plans for regulating the U.S. banking sector including a relaxation of regulations for community banks, which havestruggled with rules imposed after the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis. While investors expect the administration to have trouble winning congressional support for legislative changes to regulations such as Dodd-Frank, some are hoping Trump will be able to appoint people to key regulatory positions. If Trump can replace the Federal Reserve's head of banking supervision, this might at least help slow the pace of regulation, said investment managers. Trump is expected to nominate Carnegie Mellon University professor Marvin Goodfriend and former Treasury Departmentstaffer Randal Quarles to fill two of three open seats at the Fed, according to a New York Times report. "If they do get traction and get some of these (policy changes) done, even if they're more watered-down versions of what they had proposed, that's probably very good for sentiment and good for the fundamentals," said Miles Lewis, portfolio manager for American Century Investments' Small Cap Value fund.

Noreika, who used to represent banks at two large law firms, will have to recuse himself form overseeing banks until as late as next May.

British Prime Minister Theresa May’s decision to hold a snap election backfired as the Conservative Party lost its majority in the U.K. parliament. While it remains the largest party, the Conservatives will now have to rely on other parties to pass motions through parliament. The British pound fell sharply with the news of the result, dropping 2 percent against the dollar on Friday morning and down 1.7 percent against the euro. London’s FTSE 100, however, opened with a 0.9 percent rise, the BBC reported. Subscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week Nigel Green, the chief executive of financial services firm deVere Group, said the election had put May’s job on the line and produced “yet another enormous storm cloud of uncertainty.” “We’re entering into a perfect storm of chaos and the uncertainty is set to unleash mayhem across global financial markets, at least in the short term, as they react to the growing question marks hanging over the British parliamentary landscape,” said Green in an emailed statement. Read more: Everything you need to know about the U.K.'s shock election result The result of the election —which May called in April with the goal of increasing her parliamentary majority—comes less than two weeks before Britain enters crucial talks with European Union leaders regarding the U.K.’s exit from the political and economic union. Protester wearing a Theresa May mask poses outside Downing Street after Britain's election in London, Britain on June 9. The election result could have wide-ranging ramifications on the U.K. leaving the EU. Neil Hall/Reuters Some business chiefs and investors are suggesting that the result could derail the negotiation process, while others predict that it will result in a softer Brexit, perhaps with the U.K. remaining in the customs union. The most obvious conclusion of the election is “the likelihood of the U.K. needing to request a delay in the Brexit process has risen substantially, given the chance that political developments in the U.K. disturb what is already a time-compressed process,” said Malcolm Barr, economist at JPMorgan, in a research note reported by Reuters. The British Prime Minister triggered Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union on March 29, starting a two-year process by the end of which the U.K. is supposed to have extricated itself from the EU. Liberal Democrat former business secretary Vince Cable, who was elected to his southwest London constituency of Twickenham, said young people “who felt cheated out of their future because of the Brexit vote” had made a point in the election. “This means we will have to look at this again as Brexit is approached and the extreme-UKIP type of Brexit this government has put on the cards,” said Cable. UKIP is a right-wing British party that campaigned to leave the EU. Adam Marshall, the director of the British Chambers of Commerce, said a functioning government must be the “immediate priority,” but suggested that Brexit talks would likely suffer a delay. “No business would walk into a negotiation without clear objectives, an agreed starting position, and a strong negotiating team. It is hard to see how Brexit negotiations could begin without answers on these important questions,” said Marshall.

David Santiago Miami Herald Business June 09, 2017 6:49 AM Pass the chili paste, try a schnitzel: Food startups serve new concepts at pitch event By Jennifer Lu jlu@miamiherald.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Argentinian-Israeli schnitzel and falafel, Korean rice bowls topped with beef in red chili paste, rotisserie chicken served in an Amsterdam ambiance, a black tea blend dubbed KickAssam — these are some of the flavors that four aspiring local food startups hope to bring to the Miami food scene. The entrepreneurs presented their business plans and brands to potential investors and business mentors in a “Shark Tank” setting on Wednesday evening at the Miami culinary incubator, The Wynwood Yard. The event was the brainchild of restauranteur and Wynwood Yard founder Della Heiman, who wanted to create networking opportunities in the culinary business world akin to those she saw in Miami’s booming tech sector. “Food and beverage startups don’t necessarily get a lot of love,” said Adrienne Etkin Nascimento, who pitched her company, Admari Tea, at the event. “The fact that Della has taken this initiative is brilliant.” “We wanted to promote hyper-local ventures that are based from our communities and reflect the fabric of our culture that is Miami today,” said Heiman, who opened her restaurant, della test kitchen, at the Yard in November 2015 and leases space in the lot to new local food trucks. Although no one was designated the winner, she said, “the magic happens as people start to connect and network.” Nascimento, who has 10 years of tea retail experience and mixes her own blends, said she was looking for mentoring and advice in addition to the financial backing to open a tea boutique and to produce her ready-to-drink line of “liquid meditation” in a bottle. [READ MORE: How millennial tastes shape a new generation of food startups] Entrepreneurship can be a lonely path, Nascimento said. “Sometimes, it’s hard to get your head out of your passion and into the business sense of things.” Miami is home to 560 new entrepreneurs for every 100,000 adults in any given month, according to the 2017 Kauffman Index of Startup Activity, beating out Austin, Los Angeles, San Diego and Las Vegas for the top position on the startup index. There were just shy of 40,000 restaurants in Florida in 2015, according to the National Restauraunt Association, providing over one million food service jobs in 2017. Food is one of the easiest ways for property developers to stimulate a sense of place and community, said Joe Furst of Goldman Properties, who provided feedback to entrepreneurs at the event. Furst was joined on the advisory panel by representatives from Terra Group, EDENS, The Comras Company and The Knight Foundation. Miami made and J.P. Morgan Chase sponsored the event. “When you put together a mix of creative food and beverage professionals,” Furst said, “you create exciting communities that people want to be a part of.” However, for aspiring food and beverage startups, access to initial capital and the right location can be huge obstacles to entering the restaurant business. Coco Coig pitched in search of a seventh investor to round out support for his startup, Le Chick Rotisserie. Five weeks from opening in the Wynwood area, Coig and his business partner have secured a landlord and permission to replicate the ambiance and menu he enjoyed at a popular Amsterdam bar and restaurant chain. Brothers Alan and Bernie Klinger came to promote Shnitz n’ Fritz. For the past six months, they have been selling Argentinian-Israeli style schnitzel, falafel and fries from a food truck at The Wynwood Yard. They want to expand to a brick and mortar store with more kitchen space so they can add healthier items to their menu, as well as display and sell their bottled sauces and spreads. “To do any hot food concept, the entry fee is high,” Alan Klinger said. “Maybe some of these property owners have restaurant ready spaces we could go into and make minor modifications.” Chain restaurants tend to get first dibs on the hottest properties because they have more access to funding, he said. As a result, “there’s a lot of local concepts here that remain untapped.” Jennifer Kaminski and Sarah Raw, of 2 Korean Girls, founded their company to fill a void in South Florida they have griped about and bonded over: the lack of satisfying local Korean food. Their business plan, which would take their concept to the trial-by-food-truck phase, sells bibimbap, a Korean meat and vegetable dish that literally means “mixed rice.” They emphasized two important aspects of their brand: health and authenticity. “Korean food was healthy before being healthy was cool,” Raw said. And they have Kaminski’s mother, Sunny, who owns a Korean restaurant in Indiana and has a line of sauces and mixes at Whole Foods, to ensure authenticity. Pitching their concept at the Yard was the first time they’d shared 2 Korean Girls with anyone outside of family and friends, Kaminski said. “Now it feel like it’s become more real.” A view of the bar at The Wynwood Yard on Wednesday, June 7, 2017 in Miami.

Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., May 22, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid 10 Jun 2017 08:30AM (Updated: 10 Jun 2017 12:55PM) Share this content Share on Facebook Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share via Whatsapp Share via Whatsapp Share via E-Mail Share via E-Mail NEW YORK: A rough few months for most U.S. bank stocks has been particularly unkind to regional banks, and that’s not likely to change soon as hopes dim for higher long-term interest rates and timely policy relief from Washington. While some investors see bargains in lower valuations of regional banks' shares, few can point with any confidence to near-term catalysts for a turnaround in their fortunes. After outperforming larger banks in the wake of the Nov. 8 U.S. Presidential election, the S&P 600 index of small cap banks are down 8.1 percent so far this year, data through Thursday showed, while the S&P 500 index of the biggest U.S. banks is unchanged. The full S&P 500 , meanwhile, is up 8.7 percent. Last year, investors bet heavily that smaller, entirely U.S.-focused banks would benefit most from Donald Trump's promises of tax cuts, deregulation and economic stimulus. But those hopes dwindled dramatically as it became clear that President Trump would have difficulty gaining enough support to deliver on any of his pro-growth proposals. Advertisement Advertisement "I  would expect (smaller banks) to continue to underperform as long as we don't get some of these policy decisions to move through," said Stephen Scouten, banking analyst for Sandler O’Neill in Atlanta. Fading hopes for an economic boost from Trump's agenda has compressed the gap between short- and long-term interest rates, putting pressure on bank loan profit margins. This is a bigger issue for regionals which have a greater dependence on lending for their profits than bigger, more diversified banks. Also, commercial and industrial loan growth has slowed this year after climbing steadily since late 2010. The Federal Reserve's latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, released May 8, showed domestic banks reporting weaker commercial and industrial loan demand from firms of all sizes in the first quarter. WAITING FOR CLARITY Part of the problem is that companies are waiting for clarity on economic growth prospects and tax rates before making borrowing decisions, according to investors and analysts. sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget "Eventually, for the smaller banks to outperform, concerns about the overall economy need to dissipate. Better economic growth usually leads to better lending growth and in that environment the yield curve steepens as well," said Brian Kleinhanzl, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. Short selling has decreased in most regional and diversified banking sectors so far this year. But short interest in both the SPDR S&P Bank Exchange Traded Fund and SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF increased as short sellers may be replacing exposure to individual banks with short bets on the sector. Short interest in the S&P bank ETF is up 36 percent for the year while it is up 23 percent in the regional banking ETF. While tax cuts are viewed as one of the biggest boosts for regional banks of all Trump's policy proposals, investors are skeptical it will come any time soon. JPMorgan analysts on Thursday scaled back their forecast on the size of possible U.S. tax cuts and pushed out the timing to the second quarter of 2018 from the third quarter of 2017. White House economic adviser Gary Cohn has said he expects U.S. Congress to get tax reform done this year. But investors say 2018 would likely be the earliest this could happen. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is expected this month to unveil plans for regulating the U.S. banking sector including a relaxation of regulations for community banks, which have struggled with rules imposed after the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis. While investors expect the administration to have trouble winning congressional support for legislative changes to regulations such as Dodd-Frank, some are hoping Trump will be able to appoint people to key regulatory positions. If Trump can replace the Federal Reserve's head of banking supervision, this might at least help slow the pace of regulation, said investment managers. Trump is expected to nominate Carnegie Mellon University professor Marvin Goodfriend and former Treasury Department staffer Randal Quarles to fill two of three open seats at the Fed, according to a New York Times report. "If they do get traction and get some of these (policy changes) done, even if they're more watered-down versions of what they had proposed, that's probably very good for sentiment and good for the fundamentals," said Miles Lewis, portfolio manager for American Century Investments' Small Cap Value fund.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Renae Merle By Renae Merle June 9 Follow @renaemerle Goldman Sachs faced a looming deadline in July. Under new federal rules, the storied Wall Street bank was required to rid itself of about $6 billion in risky investments, such as stakes in hedge funds, that regulators fear could hamper it during an economic downturn. But by late last year, Goldman had yet to find a buyer and appealed to the Federal Reserve for a reprieve. The agency gave Goldman and several other banks five more years to comply with the rules put in place in response to the 2008 financial crisis. Now, it appears, Goldman may be able to keep those investments after all. Republican lawmakers passed legislation in the House this week that would do away with the requirement all together. It is part of a sweeping plan to ease banking industry rules they argue have been hampering the economy and made it more difficult to get a loan. The effort, backed by the Trump administration, aims to dismantle major portions of the Obama administration’s 2010 financial reform law, known as the Dodd Frank Act, landmark legislation that forced banks to maintain a larger financial cushion and take on less debt. “Congratulations to Jeb Hensarling & Republicans on successful House vote to repeal major parts of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law. GROWTH!,” President Trump said in a tweet Friday morning. (Rep. Hensarling, a Republican from Texas, shepherded the legislation.) Supporters touted the rules as a chance to help community and regional banks, many of which struggle to comply with a regulatory regime aimed mostly at the biggest banks. But the big banks would also gain relief, and one of the key ways is the proposed elimination of a provision known as the “Volcker rule.” The rule, named after its chief champion, former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker, has two prongs. The first limits banks’ ability to buy and sell exotic financial instruments, and the second limits the ability of banks to operate and invest in hedge funds and private-equity funds. Banks that make loans and collect consumer deposits, such as checking and savings accounts, shouldn’t be using that money to take on the same type of risks that hedge funds do, supporters of the rule say. But House Republicans argued that the Volcker has sapped liquidity from the markets — in other words, reduced the number of institutional buyers and sellers — and said in a summary of the legislation that repealing the rule would “promote more resilient capital markets and a more stable financial system.” To comply, big Wall Street banks have shut down their “proprietary trading” desks to eliminate speculative trades and began selling off their investments in hedge and private equity funds. The shift was particularly significant for Goldman, which once claimed that such proprietary trading accounted for 10 percent of its revenue. In an CNBC interview earlier this year, Goldman chief executive Lloyd Blankfein said restrictions on bank trading could prevent companies from being involved in the kinds of transactions that are “beneficial to the financial markets. There should be more flexibility.” Many in the industry complain that the regulations governing the Volcker rule are so complex it made it difficult to distinguish between the financial transactions a bank may do on its own behalf, purely for profit, or on behalf of a client. Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, once warned that “for every trader, we are going to have to have a lawyer, compliance officer, doctor to see what their testosterone levels are, and a shrink — what is your intent?” Some regulators have acknowledged the complexity of the rules, though critics say banks are exaggerating. “Proprietary trading had banks with conflicts of interest against their customers,” Volcker said in an interview. “The idea that the restraint on proprietary trading is hurting customer service is baloney.” In the meantime, big banks have received two extensions to comply with aspects of the rule, the first in 2015. The latest covers “illiquid funds,” typically investments banks made in hedge and private funds that may now be difficult to sell. “I have doubts over the need for an extension. How much of it is just a hope that the rule would go away?,” Volcker said. The extension gave Goldman more time to rid itself of about $6 billion in investments. Morgan Stanley has applied for more time to deal with about $1.9 billion of such assets. Citigroup only has about $400 million left and has also been granted an extension. The bank’s chief executive, Michael Corbat, said at a banking conference earlier this month that it was time to make changes to Volcker. “We don’t want to be in the proprietary trading business. We don’t want to be using consumer deposits to speculate,” he said. But the law is too complex, Corbat said, noting that the rules had been written by five different agencies. Those agencies “have taken the same law, the same rule and applied it five different ways. And what we’ve said is we don’t care which one, just pick one of them. Pick one of them and enforce it that way, and we’d be great with that.” The House legislation that would repeal the rule all together is unlikely to pass the Senate intact and regulators, who already spent years wiring the rules, may shy away from making significant, time-consuming changes. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker who has been directed by Trump to make recommendations on improving the banking system, appears to be leaning toward a compromise. “I support the Volcker Rule, but there needs to be proper definition around the Volcker Rule so banks can understand what they can do and what they can’t do,” Mnuchin told the Senate Banking Committee in January. The effort to repeal or even weaken the rule has outraged some. “The Volcker firewall was among the most critical pieces of Wall Street reform,” said Jeff Merkley (D-Oregon), one of the original sponsors of the provision. “This casino allowed banks to make big bets with taxpayer-insured funds, destabilizing the financial system and the U.S. economy.” But a repeal of the rule could pay off for big banks. Wall Street banks stand to recoup about $2 billion in profits next year if the trading restrictions were lifted, according to research by Nomura, a global investment bank. That includes a boost of about $446 million for Goldman. business economy false after3th true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!
