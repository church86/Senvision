REUTERS/Joshua Lott/File Photo By Richa Naidu and Dan Freed Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported its first profit increase in three quarters on Monday, foiling expectations for another drop, as bond trading surged and expenses fell. Like rivals JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N), Bank of America enjoyed a boost from a resurgence in trading. That came as clients scrambled to reposition after Britain's surprise June vote to leave the European Union, and changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan's cost-cutting campaign also paid off as expenses fell in each of its four major business segments. On a pretax basis, quarterly profit was at its highest in a decade. Net income attributable to shareholders rose 6.6 percent to $4.45 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 41 cents, from 38 cents in the same period of 2015. Analysts, on average, had estimated a decline to 34 cents a share. Revenue grew 3 percent to $21.64 billion, beating the $20.97 billion expected by analysts. Net profit in Bank of America's trading-focused Global Markets arm jumped 34 percent from a year earlier as revenue from dealing fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities surged 39 percent. Equity trading revenue fell 17 percent. Last week, JPMorgan reported a 48 percent increase in bond trading and Citi posted a 35 percent gain. Trading in stocks rose 1 percent and fell 34 percent respectively at JPMorgan and Citi. Like Bank of America, JMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo beat third-quarter profit and revenue forecasts but their net earnings declined; JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) by 7.6 percent, Citigroup Inc's (C.N) by 10.5 percent and Wells Fargo & Co's (WFC.N) by 3.7 percent. Shares of Bank of America were little changed, up 0.15 percent in afternoon trading. Ahead of Monday, the stock had shed 4.9 percent since the start of the year, compared to a 2.5 percent decline in the KBW banking index .BKX. DUAL ROLES After scandal-ridden Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) separated its chief executive and chairman roles last week with the retirement of John Stumpf, Moynihan was asked during a conference call on Monday whether he expected renewed pressure to give up his dual role from regulators or shareholders. "Our lead independent director duty is as strong as anybody's in the industry," said Moynihan, who had faced down a shareholder vote last year over whether to split the roles. He added that he felt "comfortable" with the bank's current governance. Bank of America's large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities make it particularly dependent on a rise in interest rates to boost profits. To compensate for stubbornly low interest rates, Moynihan made trimming costs a top priority, saying in July he would cut annual expenses by another $5 billion by 2018, which would take the total to about $53 billion from about $58 billion in 2015. In the third quarter, non-interest expenses fell 3.3 percent to $13.48 billion as headcount fell by 3 percent. Like rivals, Bank of America got a boost from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more than $300 trillion worth of financial products worldwide. Libor moved to a seven-year high during the third quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings in short-term bank debt in advance of new regulations. Bank of America's net interest income rose 3 percent to $10.20 billion, the first increase in three quarters. Like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, BofA set aside more money to cover potential bad loans. The bank's provisions rose 5.5 percent to $850 million in the quarter. Income from investment banking rose 13.3 percent to $1.46 billion, driven by higher debt and equity issuance activity. Revenue for advising on deals tumbled 19 percent as companies held off making acquisitions amid political uncertainty in the United States and Brexit-related volatility in Britain. Adjusted revenue from Bank of America's wealth and investment management unit, which includes Merrill Lynch, fell 1.7 percent to $4.38 billion, but a 6 percent drop in non-interest expenses helped to boost net income by 10 percent. The wealth business, which has been a stable source of revenue growth when trading and investment banking revenues have fluctuated, is undergoing its own changes, with a new boss, longtime executive Andy Sieg, expected to take over in 2017 and amid a regulatory overhaul of financial advice in the United States.

After working off card balances he built up during college, Low started collecting new cards in May specifically to reap the increasingly lucrative travel awards banks are offering to encourage spending on their cards. In August, Low snagged a new Sapphire Reserve card, from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, which has become a magnet for millennials willing to pay the $450 annual fee for a sign-up bonus worth as much as $1,500 in travel, plus $300 in annual spending credits and more freebies. Low illustrates the problem. JPMorgan won't know if he will become a profitable customer for another year because the up-front rewards are so great. He may drop the Reserve card before the next annual fee. He has already acquired two more cards and now is spending on those to meet their requirements for more sign-up bonuses. And he doesn’t intend to borrow on his cards. That could be bad for JPMorgan because credit card companies historically have made about three-fourths of their revenue from interest. The rest has come from fees, which are being whittled away by the rising costs of the givebacks. Still, JPMorgan executives say they are thrilled that many more young people applied for the Reserve card than they ever expected. That's especially true with millennials - people who reached adulthood around 2000 - who are the next generation of depositors and borrowers. To make money from the card, JPMorgan has to have the right mix of customer spending, annual renewals and borrowing with repayments, said John Grund, a partner at card industry consulting firm First Annapolis. Marianne Lake, JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, declined to say how much card debt the bank needs customers to take on.

It’s finally paying off. Embed from Getty Images   Bloomberg News reports that Citigroup’s fixed-income revenue surged 35% to $3.47bn in the third quarter, and JPMorgan Chase posted $4.33bn from the business, $1bn more than analysts’ average estimates. Marianne Lake, JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, said Friday that the momentum continued into October. That would be a welcome change from the past seven years. Revenue from trading fixed-income products -- typically bonds, currencies and commodities -- tumbled to $70bn in 2015 at the world’s biggest investment banks, about half the 2009 level, according to data compiled by financial-research firm Coalition Ltd. U.S. banks have been counting on a rebound, as European rivals such as UBS retreated or cut deep to save money. Friday’s earnings reports may bode well for Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which report third-quarter results next week.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Matt Turner (mturner@businessinsider.com) Oct 17th 2016 11:11AM Banks are giving away credit cards at a rate. Bank of America Merrill Lynch just reported strong third-quarter earnings, and buried in the earnings release was this factoid: new US consumer credit card issuance hit the highest level since 2008. The bank issued 1.3 million credit cards during the three month period, with total credit card loans for the period averaging $88.2 billion in the US, with a further $9.7 billion outside the US. There was a similar story at Citigroup, where credit-card loans hit $147.8 billion, up 13% from a year ago. And at JPMorgan, there was a whopping 2.7 million new accounts opened during the third quarter, sending JPMorgan's credit card balance to $133.4 billion, up 5% from a year ago.

The boom in credit cards is something we've been tracking for a while at Business Insider. In August, the Liberty Street Economics blog at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published a study on recent developments in consumer credit card borrowing that highlighted booming new card issuance. The increase has been driven by those with lower credit scores, though these individuals were getting lower credit limits than in the past. "Although new cards are disproportionately issued to lower credit score borrowers, the overall extension of new credit, measured by increases in aggregate credit limits, continues to go overwhelmingly to those with credit scores above 720," the researchers wrote. The business case for growing credit card balances is clear. Bank of America said in its earnings release that the yield for US credit cards stood at 9.3% in the third quarter, making it a highly profitable business. Of course, you know, there's risks involved too.

REUTERS/Joshua Lott/File Photo By Richa Naidu and Dan Freed Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported its first profit increase in three quarters on Monday, foiling expectations for another drop, as bond trading surged and expenses fell. Like rivals JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N), Bank of America enjoyed a boost from a resurgence in trading. That came as clients scrambled to reposition after Britain's surprise June vote to leave the European Union, and changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan's cost-cutting campaign also paid off as expenses fell in each of its four major business segments. On a pretax basis, quarterly profit was at its highest in a decade. Net income attributable to shareholders rose 6.6 percent to $4.45 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 41 cents, from 38 cents in the same period of 2015. Analysts, on average, had estimated a decline to 34 cents a share. Revenue grew 3 percent to $21.64 billion, beating the $20.97 billion expected by analysts. Net profit in Bank of America's trading-focused Global Markets arm jumped 34 percent from a year earlier as revenue from dealing fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities surged 39 percent. Equity trading revenue fell 17 percent. Last week, JPMorgan reported a 48 percent increase in bond trading and Citi posted a 35 percent gain. Trading in stocks rose 1 percent and fell 34 percent respectively at JPMorgan and Citi. Like Bank of America, JMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo beat third-quarter profit and revenue forecasts but their net earnings declined; JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) by 7.6 percent, Citigroup Inc's (C.N) by 10.5 percent and Wells Fargo & Co's (WFC.N) by 3.7 percent. Shares of Bank of America were little changed, up 0.15 percent in afternoon trading. Ahead of Monday, the stock had shed 4.9 percent since the start of the year, compared to a 2.5 percent decline in the KBW banking index .BKX. DUAL ROLES After scandal-ridden Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) separated its chief executive and chairman roles last week with the retirement of John Stumpf, Moynihan was asked during a conference call on Monday whether he expected renewed pressure to give up his dual role from regulators or shareholders. "Our lead independent director duty is as strong as anybody's in the industry," said Moynihan, who had faced down a shareholder vote last year over whether to split the roles. He added that he felt "comfortable" with the bank's current governance. Bank of America's large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities make it particularly dependent on a rise in interest rates to boost profits. To compensate for stubbornly low interest rates, Moynihan made trimming costs a top priority, saying in July he would cut annual expenses by another $5 billion by 2018, which would take the total to about $53 billion from about $58 billion in 2015. In the third quarter, non-interest expenses fell 3.3 percent to $13.48 billion as headcount fell by 3 percent. Like rivals, Bank of America got a boost from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more than $300 trillion worth of financial products worldwide. Libor moved to a seven-year high during the third quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings in short-term bank debt in advance of new regulations. Bank of America's net interest income rose 3 percent to $10.20 billion, the first increase in three quarters. Like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, BofA set aside more money to cover potential bad loans. The bank's provisions rose 5.5 percent to $850 million in the quarter. Income from investment banking rose 13.3 percent to $1.46 billion, driven by higher debt and equity issuance activity. Revenue for advising on deals tumbled 19 percent as companies held off making acquisitions amid political uncertainty in the United States and Brexit-related volatility in Britain. Adjusted revenue from Bank of America's wealth and investment management unit, which includes Merrill Lynch, fell 1.7 percent to $4.38 billion, but a 6 percent drop in non-interest expenses helped to boost net income by 10 percent. The wealth business, which has been a stable source of revenue growth when trading and investment banking revenues have fluctuated, is undergoing its own changes, with a new boss, longtime executive Andy Sieg, expected to take over in 2017 and amid a regulatory overhaul of financial advice in the United States.

"Our lead independent director duty is as strong as anybody's in the industry," said Moynihan, who had faced down a shareholder vote last year over whether to split the roles. He added that he felt "comfortable" with the bank's current governance. Bank of America's large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities make it particularly dependent on a rise in interest rates to boost profits. To compensate for stubbornly low interest rates, Moynihan made trimming costs a top priority, saying in July he would cut annual expenses by another US$5 billion by 2018, which would take the total to about US$53 billion from about US$58 billion in 2015. In the third quarter, non-interest expenses fell 3.3 percent to US$13.48 billion as headcount fell by 3 percent. Like rivals, Bank of America got a boost from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more than US$300 trillion worth of financial products worldwide. Libor moved to a seven-year high during the third quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings in short-term bank debt in advance of new regulations. Bank of America's net interest income rose 3 percent to US$10.20 billion, the first increase in three quarters. Like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, BofA set aside more money to cover potential bad loans. The bank's provisions rose 5.5 percent to US$850 million in the quarter. Income from investment banking rose 13.3 percent to US$1.46 billion, driven by higher debt and equity issuance activity. Revenue for advising on deals tumbled 19 percent as companies held off making acquisitions amid political uncertainty in the United States and Brexit-related volatility in Britain. Adjusted revenue from Bank of America's wealth and investment management unit, which includes Merrill Lynch, fell 1.7 percent to US$4.38 billion, but a 6 percent drop in non-interest expenses helped to boost net income by 10 percent. The wealth business, which has been a stable source of revenue growth when trading and investment banking revenues have fluctuated, is undergoing its own changes, with a new boss, longtime executive Andy Sieg, expected to take over in 2017 and amid a regulatory overhaul of financial advice in the United States.

Photo Credit: John Cumming/Getty Images The best rewards credit cards boast attractive cash back percentages, travel rewards, appealing sign-up bonuses and simple redemption models. Rewards credit cards can be divided into 2 general categories: travel and cash back cards. Some rewards cards offer a combo of those and points instead of straight cash back. The card that's best for you depends on your lifestyle and personal financial goals. Travel rewards cards typically offer perks and bonuses for spending on items such as airline purchases, dining, restaurants and hotels. <!-- iframe --> Cash back cards generally offer a percentage back for daily spending, cash back on specific categories and bonus cash for spending a specific amount within a certain time frame. In October 2016, CreditCards.com rounded up some of the best credit cards from its partners, including the best rewards credit cards. Here are the some of the best rewards credit cards, according to the October 2016 roundup from CreditCards.com: The best rewards credit cards Credit Card Variable APR Category Chase Freedom Unlimited 14.24% to 23.24% Top all-around rewards card Citi® Double Cash Credit Card 13.24% and 23.24% Top no annual fee rewards card Blue Cash Preferred® Card 13.24% and 23.24% Top cash-back rewards card Chase Sapphire Reserve 16.24% and 23.24% Top travel and airline rewards card Chase Sapphire Preferred® 16.24% to 23.24% Top points rewards card 1. Top all-around rewards credit card: Chase Freedom Unlimited CreditCards.com rated the Chase Freedom Unlimited credit card as one of the best for all-around rewards. With multiple redemption options, it offers unlimited 1.5% cash back on every purchase made. This card also boasts a $150 statement credit after spending $500 within 3 months of opening the account. Highlights: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card pays 1.5% cash back on every purchase. Chase Freedom Unlimited cardholders earn a solid $150 bonus statement credit for spending $500 purchases within the first 3 months of opening an account. This card allows you to redeem rewards for cash in any amount at any time. Those cash back rewards don't expire as long as the account is open. Chase Ultimate Rewards® points, worth 1 cent, can be transferred to other Chase cards that earn Chase Ultimate Rewards® points. Points can be redeemed for gift cards and trips booked through Chase. Fees and APR: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card has no annual fee. This card offers a 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers. After the initial introductory period, the Chase Freedom Unlimited card offers a variable APR of 14.24% to 23.24%. There's a balance transfer fee of 5% of the amount transferred with a $5 minimum on the Chase Freedom Unlimited Card. Who should get this card: The Chase Freedom Unlimited is ideal for the consumer who wants a straightforward card for everyday purchases. Anyone looking for a wide range of redemption options will enjoy this card's versatility. The Chase Freedom Unlimited is especially useful for those who already hold other high-end Chase cards – like the Chase Sapphire Preferred or the Ink Plus Business Card -- since Chase Ultimate Rewards® can be transferred to other Chase cards. Disadvantages: While the Chase Freedom Unlimited has its perks – like unlimited rewards points – it has its limitations as well. Its cash-back rewards are middle of the road. The Chase Freedom Unlimited card's rate on cash back is good, but it's not the highest flat-rate available. The Citi® Double Dash Card offers 1% cash back on every dollar spent plus an additional 1% on every dollar that's paid off. There are no bonus categories. Perhaps the biggest downside to the Chase Freedom Unlimited is that it doesn't offer bonus categories. Those who spend frequently in one area may find that a card with bonus categories offers more value. Bottom line: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card is a solid all around choice as a flat-rate card for rewards on everyday spending. It might be best utilized alongside another Chase card or bonus category card that offers higher percentages on spending in specific categories. 2. Top no annual fee rewards card: Citi® Double Cash Credit Card The Citi® Double Cash Credit Card recently took 1st place in CreditCard.com's cash back credit card competition for its industry-leading cash back on everyday purchases. But it also made the site's October 2016 list as the top no annual fee credit card. It has a simple rewards structure with no categories to track, no caps on cash back and no annual fee. Highlights: The opportunity to earn generous rewards using the Citi® Double Cash credit card is what makes it stand out from the crowd. It offers 1% cash back on general purchases and an additional 1% when you pay your bill on time. There's no limit on what you can earn in cash back with this card. You can start redeeming for as little as $25. Redemption options include a statement credit, a gift card or a check. As a perk for some, the Citi® Double Cash credit card has no rotating categories requiring cardholders to remember to opt in and score rewards. The Citi® Double Cash card has no annual fee, making it cheaper than some competing cards, such as the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express. Not only does the Citi® Double Cash offer generous cash back rewards, it has perks including purchase protection and trip cancellation protection. Citi® Double Cash cardholders can benefit from the Citi Price Rewind program. The company will automatically search for lower prices on items registered online and refund the difference on better deals. Fees and APR: There's no annual fee with the Citi® Double Cash credit card. This card comes with a 0% APR on balance transfers for 18 months. That makes it a good option for those interested in consolidating and paying down debt. This card comes with a variable APR between 13.24% and 23.24%. Who should get this card: The Citi® Double Cash credit card is best for those who would like a flat-rate, everyday cash back card with no limits on rewards and an easy-to-use rewards structure. Those looking for simplicity in a card will also find this card ideal. There's no chasing bonus categories, no rotating categories and no annual fee. Disadvantages: The opportunity to earn cash back twice and the simplicity of this card make it a very attractive option, but there are some drawbacks. Carrying a balance can eat up rewards with this card. Interest charges can add up quick on this card's 13.24% to 23.24% variable APR. You have to pay on time. In order to earn cash back twice, the card requires you to pay your bill on time each month. If you typically carry a balance, or often fail to pay on time, this may not be the card for you. There's no sign-up bonus. Sign-up bonuses are something you'll find on many competing cards, but not on the Citi® Double Cash. There are no bonus categories. This card certainly has a high rewards rate, but there's no opportunity to earn more for spending in certain categories. If you frequently spend big on a particular category – like groceries – you may want to consider another card. Bottom line: The Citi® Double Cash credit card is a great option for straight cash back rewards. It doesn't offer bonus categories, but it’s a great go-to card for earning rewards on daily purchases. Consider using this card alongside another card that offers more for where you spend the most. Compare Rewards Credit Cards 3. Top cash back card: Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express The Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express tied for 2nd place with the Chase Freedom Unlimited card in CreditCard.com's recent cash back card competition. It earns big kudos for very generous rewards on categories – 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets and 3% cash back on gas stations and select department stores. Highlights: The Blue Cash Preferred® is a top-notch card for high rewards rates on categories. It offers 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets up to $6,000 per year. It also offers 3% cash back at U.S. gas stations and select department stores. On general purchases, this card pays 1%. For the 1st 6 months, the Blue Cash Preferred® card offers 5% cash back on eligible travel purchases up to $200. The Blue Cash Preferred® offers a $150 statement credit after spending $1,000 within the 1st 3 months of opening an account. Other perks with the Blue Cash Preferred® include a cash back tracker, purchase protection, return protection and roadside assistance. Fees: The Blue Cash Preferred® credit card has a variable APR between 13.24% and 23.24%, comparable to the other cards on this list. This card has a $95 annual fee, which is on the high side. But the generous rewards program, when used properly, can offset that fee. Who should get this card: The Blue Cash Preferred® credit card is best for those who spend big on groceries, gas and department stores. Those who already have a card for everyday spending might find this card as a nice supplement. Pair this card with an everyday flat-rate card to get more for your money where you spend the most. The 0% APR on purchases and balance transfers for 12 months make the Blue Cash Preferred® credit card a good option for anyone interested in financing a big purchase or consolidating and paying down debt. Disadvantages: The outstanding rewards on categories make the Blue Cash Preferred® credit card from American Express an attractive option, but it's not without its limitations. It has a spending cap. The $6,000 annual spending cap on groceries means the most you could earn is $360 at 6% before the relatively low 1% rate kicks in. It's not as widely accepted. American Express isn't as widely used as Visa, MasterCard and Discover. That might make it necessary to keep a backup card, or to use this card strategically with others. The $95 annual fee is higher than other cash-back cards. You'll need to make sure you spend often in this card's bonus categories to get the most value. Bottom line: The Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express can be used as an everyday card, but it really shines as a bonus category card. It might best be used alongside a card like the Citi® Double Cash or Chase Freedom Unlimited. CARD SEARCH: Compare the top rewards credit cards. 4. Top travel and airline credit card: Chase Sapphire Reserve The Chase Sapphire Reserve cards earns high ratings on CreditCards.com's best credit cards for October 2016 list for its travel and airline rewards. It offers generous bonus points, an annual $300 travel credit and a top-notch rewards system. Highlights: The Chase Sapphire Reserve offers 3 Chase Ultimate Rewards® points per dollar spent on travel and dining at restaurants worldwide. It offers 1 point per dollar spent on other purchases. Chase Sapphire Reserve cardholders receive up to $300 in statement credits annually as a reimbursement for travel purchases on things like airfare and hotels charged to the card. As one of its biggest perks, Chase Sapphire Reserve cardholders can earn 100,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months after opening the account. Overall, that's a $1,500 travel reward when redeemed through Chase Ultimate Rewards® program. Points can be redeemed for 1.5 cents per point through Chase Ultimate Rewards®. This card offers access to more than 900 airport lounges worldwide with complimentary Priority Pass Select membership. Cardholders can get up to a $100 application fee credit for Global Entry or TSA Pre√®. As another perk, there are no blackout dates or travel restrictions with this card. If there's a seat on the flight, it can be booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards. Cardholders can transfer points to one of Chase's partner airline or hotel loyalty programs at a 1:1 rate. Fees: The Chase Sapphire Reserve card has an annual fee of $450, similar to other cards in its class like the Citi Prestige® Card. But the sign-up bonus alone could pay for the first 3 years of the card, assuming you spend $4,000 within the first 3 months of opening the card to earn 100,000 bonus points. This card comes with a variable APR between 16.24% and 23.24%. Who should get this card: The Chase Sapphire Reserve card is best for the avid traveler who spends big on travel and dining and is fine with redeeming rewards through Chase Ultimate Rewards® program. Disadvantages: The Chase Sapphire Reserve offers big rewards to the frequent traveler, but it's not without its downsides. The card's hefty $450 annual fee can certainly eat into rewards if you're not spending heavily on travel and dining related expenses. You'll get the most benefit from this card by redeeming through the Chase Ultimate Rewards® program. If it's not a program you're fond of, it might be best to find another card. The bottom line Overall, the Chase Sapphire Reserve card is a solid choice for the frequent traveler. Its points program and bonus can more than make up for the somewhat hefty $450 annual fee. But you'll need to spend big in order to enjoy the benefits of this card. 5. Top points rewards credit card: Chase Sapphire Preferred® card Generous points, a stellar sign-up bonus and a low annual fee put the Chase Sapphire Preferred® card on the map as the best points rewards card. It made CreditCard.com's list of best credit cards for October 2016. While its points aren't as generous as the Chase Sapphire Reserve card, its annual fee is much lower. The Chase Sapphire Preferred® pays 2 points per dollar on travel and dining at restaurants worldwide. It pays 1 point per dollar on all other purchases. Highlights: The Chase Sapphire Preferred® offers cardholders 2 points per dollar on travel and restaurants worldwide. All other purchases on this card earn 1 point per dollar. Cardholders can earn 50,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 within the first 3 months of opening the account. Notably, that's $625 toward travel when redeemed through the Chase Ultimate Rewards® program. For adding an authorized user within the first 3 months of opening an account, this card offers $5,000 bonus points. Cardholders can transfer points to one of Chase's partner airline or hotel loyalty programs at a 1:1 rate. There are no blackout dates or travel restrictions with this card. If there's a seat on the flight, it can be booked through Chase Ultimate Rewards®. Fees: The Chase Sapphire Preferred® credit card has a $0 introductory fee for the first year. After that, the fee is $95 per year, or $355 less than the Chase Sapphire Reserve card. This card has a variable APR from 16.24% to 23.24%. There are no foreign transaction fees with this card. Who should get this card: The Chase Sapphire Preferred® card is ideal for someone interested in an everyday, low-fee travel card with an outstanding sign-up bonus. Frequent travelers who are comfortable using the Chase Unlimited Rewards will find this card even more useful. When redeemed through the program, points are worth 25% more. Disadvantages: The generous points and sign-up bonus make the Chase Sapphire Preferred® a go-to for the frequent traveler, but it has a few disadvantages. Those who don't spend enough to earn the sign-up bonus or pay for the annual fee won't benefit much from this card. Travel options are somewhat limited with this card. You'll need to fly on one of Chase's travel partners – like United, Virgin Atlantic or Southwest – to get the most out of it. The bottom line: The Chase Sapphire Preferred® credit card is a great choice if you spend big on travel and dining at restaurants. It's also a good option if you typically use Chase's travel partners. But if you're not a big spender and need more flexible traveling options, it's wise to choose a different card.

Business Home LBoard ‘We can’t stop Umno members, who belong to NGOs, taking part’ Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Bank of America profit rises on bond trading, cost cuts Reuters | October 17, 2016 Chief Executive Brian Moynihan's cost-cutting campaign also paid off as expenses fell in each of its four major business segments. NEW YORK: Bank of America Corp, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported its first profit increase in three quarters on Monday, foiling expectations for another drop, as bond trading surged and expenses fell. Like rivals JPMorgan and Citigroup Bank of America enjoyed a boost from a resurgence in trading. That came as clients scrambled to reposition after Britain’s surprise June vote to leave the European Union, and changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan’s cost-cutting campaign also paid off as expenses fell in each of its four major business segments. On a pretax basis, quarterly profit was at its highest in a decade. Net income attributable to shareholders rose 6.6 percent to $4.45 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 41 cents, from 38 cents in the same period of 2015. Analysts, on average, had estimated a decline to 34 cents a share. Revenue grew 3 percent to $21.64 billion, beating the $20.97 billion expected by analysts. Net profit in Bank of America’s trading-focused Global Markets arm jumped 34 percent from a year earlier as revenue from dealing fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities surged 39 percent. Equity trading revenue fell 17 percent. Last week, JPMorgan reported a 48 percent increase in bond trading and Citi posted a 35 percent gain. Like Bank of American, JMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo beat third-quarter profit and revenue forecasts but their net earnings declined; JPMorgan Chase & Co’s by 7.6 percent, Citigroup Inc’s by 10.5 percent and Wells Fargo & Co’s by 3.7 percent. Shares of Bank of America rose 1.07 percent in premarket trading. Its stock has fallen 4.9 percent since the start of the year, compared to a 2.5 percent decline in the KBW banking index .BKX. Costs Bank of America’s large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities makes it particularly dependent on a rise in interest rates to boost profits. To compensate for stubbornly low interest rates, Moynihan made trimming costs a top priority, saying in July he would cut annual expenses by another $5 billion by 2018, which would take the total to about $58 billion from about $53 billion in 2015. In the third quarter, non-interest expenses fell 3.3 percent to $13.48 billion. Like rivals, Bank of America got a boost from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more than $300 trillion worth of financial products worldwide. Libor moved to a seven-year high during the third quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings in short-term bank debt in advance of new regulations. Bank of America’s net interest income rose 3 percent to $10.20 billion, the first increase in three quarters. Like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, BofA set aside more money to cover potential bad loans. The bank’s provisions rose 5.5 percent to $850 million in the quarter. Income from investment banking rose 13.3 percent to $1.46 billion, driven by higher debt and equity issuance activity. Adjusted revenue from Bank of America’s wealth and investment management unit, which includes Merrill Lynch, fell 1.7 percent to $4.38 billion, but a 6 percent drop in non-interest expenses helped to boost net income by 10 percent. The wealth business has played a significant role in the bank’s strategy to grow revenue from more stable businesses that require relatively little capital.

Stocks slip as investors digest data, earnings; energy lags CNBC 10/17/2016 Fred Imbert © Provided by CNBC U.S. stocks traded slightly lower on Monday as investors digested a number of corporate results, key economic data while keeping an eye on the Federal Reserve. "I think the market needs to get assurance from Corporate America. They want to know that things are getting better," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "This is still a market that's trying to figure out whether it wants to break higher or lower." Quotes in the article International Business Machines Corp IBM ▼ 159.31 -0.49 -0.31% Hasbro Inc HAS ▼ 84.67 -1.28 -1.49% Netflix Inc NFLX ▼ 114.35 -0.68 -0.59% Charles Schwab Corp SCHW ▲ 37.60 +0.56 +1.52% The Dow Jones industrial average fell about 15 points, with McDonald's and Merck contributing the most losses. The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent, with energy leading decliners. U.S. crude fell more than 1 percent to $49.80 per barrel, weighed by a rising rig count in the United States. "A pullback unfolded last week, leading to a successful test of initial support near 2115 by the SPX. Short-term momentum has weakened, but oversold conditions are widespread enough to suggest that the pullback will mature this week," Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG, said in a Monday note. The Nasdaq fell 0.14 percent, as shares of Apple and the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) dropped 0.4 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively. At the open, the three major indexes hovered around the flatline. Banking giant Bank of America and toymaker Hasbro were among the firms reporting quarterly earnings before the bell. Both firms beat Wall Street estimates. IBM and Netflix are among the companies scheduled to release results after the close on Monday. Earnings season has gotten off to a good start. Of the 34 S&P 500 companies that had reported as of Friday morning, 79 percent had beaten Wall Street estimates for earnings per share, according to Nick Raich of The Earnings Scout. Last week, banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo all reported better-than-expected profits and sales. Investors also digested industrial production data, which showed a 0.1 percent increase in September, slightly below a consensus estimate of 0.2 percent. Meanwhile, the New York Fed's Empire State business conditions showed manufacturing in the state contracted for the third straight month. "Manufacturing production in the US has basically flat lined over the past two years and there are no signs that will change anytime soon to the upside," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. Investors have been heavily scrutinizing U.S. economic data, as well as remarks from key Fed officials, gauging the likelihood the central bank raises rates before year's end. Later on Monday, Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer is scheduled to speak at the Economic Club of New York. A slew of economic data is scheduled for release later this week, including CPI, housing starts and the Beige Book. "I think the most important report this week will be the CPI report. I think it will show inflation further rising here," said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. He added the report would carry added weight after Fed Chair Janet Yellen's speech on Friday. Yellen said it's useful to consider the benefits of a "high-pressure economy," adding the post-financial crisis period has pushed policymakers into reconsidering the dynamics of inflation. Overseas, Chinese GDP, retail sales and industrial profits are all scheduled for release on Wednesday. Last week, U.S. stocks were weighed down by a surprise fall in Chinese exports. "It's pretty clear that China is bumping along the bottom. When we'll see a turnaround, that's unknown," said Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors. But "when you talk to companies that have boots on the ground, ... I think that's gives better color on the data." Ogg pointed specifically to Caterpillar, which is scheduled to report quarterly results next week. Elsewhere, U.S. Treasury yields slipped but remained close to recent highs, with the two-year note yield around 0.82 percent and the 10-year yield near 1.77 percent. The U.S. dollar fell slightly against a basket of currencies, with the euro steady below $1.10 and the yen just below 104. —CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

These are the three best MLP ETFs designed to track portfolios assembled by top index providers Alerian and Cushing Asset Management. Jordan Wathen (TMFValueMagnet) Oct 16, 2016 at 8:04PM Image source: Getty Images. Master limited partnerships (MLPs) offer sky-high dividend yields earned primarily from the transportation of oil and gas. Although they're simple to buy individually, investing in a diversified portfolio of MLPs in index funds can be tricky, as obscure tax and fund laws require fund sponsors to jump through hoops to design workable sector funds. These three MLP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) simplify tax complications and carry low expense ratios, making them the best MLP ETFs on the market today. MLP ETF Expense Ratio  Yield Alerian MLP ETF (NYSEMKT:AMLP) 0.85% 7.6% JPMorgan Alerian MLP ETN (NYSEMKT:AMJ) 0.85% 6.9% Credit Suisse X-Links Cushing 30 MLP Infrastructure ETN (NYSEMKT:MLPN) 0.85% 6.5% Data source: ETF and ETN sponsors. Here's why these exchange-traded products earn a top spot in diversified MLP investments. A true MLP ETF -- sort of The largest ETF in its industry, the Alerian MLP ETF is designed to simplify the process of investing in MLPs. This fund seeks to track the Alerian MLP Infrastructure Index, which tracks a portfolio of 25 MLPs that generate the majority of their cash flow from midstream activities in energy.  The Alerian MLP ETF is market-cap-weighted, so the largest MLPs make up substantially more of its portfolio than smaller MLPs. As a result, the three largest holdings -- Magellan Midstream Partners, Enterprise Products Partners, and Energy Transfer Partners -- make up more than 30% of the portfolio on a combined basis. The Alerian MLP ETF operates as a corporation rather than a true fund, and thus it pays corporate taxes on the distributions received on its MLP investments. Distributions from the ETF to its shareholders are then taxed again as dividend income. The upside to its structure is that investors who own it receive a simple 1099 from the company at tax time, and do not have to file Schedule K-1 that can cause a headache for investors who are not familiar with the extra tax responsibilities that come with MLP investing. This fund's biggest advantage is also its biggest disadvantage. Because the fund pays corporate taxes on distributions, it has lagged the performance of its index considerably. Over the five-year period ended Dec. 31, 2015, admittedly a poor period for the MLP industry as a whole, the fund generated average annual returns of 0.64% versus 3.01% for the underlying index, due to corporate taxation on MLP distributions and, to a lesser extent, fees charged to the fund. So, while this is an excellent fund for tracking the changes in MLP share prices, taxation on the fat dividends paid by MLPs leads it to underperform its index over time. The next two funds may be better-suited for investors who are interested in long-term return potential.  This ETN tracks the MLP index  Though it isn't an ETF by definition, the JPMorgan Alerian ETN offers investors the ability to invest in a product that tracks the performance of the MLP industry. It tracks the Alerian MLP Index, which includes 44 companies and weights them by market capitalization, seeking to invest in companies that make up 85% of the industry's collective market value. Exchange-traded notes do not invest in stocks that make up the underlying index like ETFs do. They are simply notes issued by an issuing bank (JPMorgan Chase, in this case) that are designed to track the value of an index. In effect, an ETN is a debt security issued by a bank that trades on the stock market. Its structure as a note is important for several reasons. First, an exchange-traded note is only as good as the credit of the issuing bank, but JPMorgan's status as a "too big to fail" institution is comforting to many investors. Second, because it is an ETN, all of its distributions are taxed as ordinary income because the ETN is a debt security and thus its "dividends" are actually interest. Finally, because it is an ETN, you'll receive a simple 1099 form at tax time, rather than the Schedule K-1 you would receive from individual MLPs. Though the underlying index is a very popular index for MLPs, investors should note that the index is market-cap-weighted and float-adjusted, resulting in an index where a handful of MLPs drive the majority of its performance. Its top three holdings -- Enterprise Products Partners, Magellan Midstream Partners, and Energy Transfer Partners -- combined make up just over 39% of the index. An MLP ETN with higher return potential Credit Suisse's premier MLP product is also an ETN, and thus it has all of the same tax and risk factors as the JPMorgan product. The primary difference is that this ETN is issued by Credit Suisse and tracks the Cushing 30 MLP Index, an equal-weighted index of 30 midstream MLPs. Stocks are picked for the index by a proprietary formula that selects companies based on fundamental metrics like cash flow generation. The real difference maker is how the underlying index works. The index weights all 30 stocks equally, and as a result the portfolio has significantly more small-cap exposure than other MLP ETFs and ETNs, as the index does not give preference to companies with larger market capitalizations. This ETN is inherently more volatile than other sector ETFs and ETNs. The chart below shows its price performance in comparison with those of the Alerian MLP ETF and JPMorgan Alerian MLP ETN over a recent five-year period. AMLP, AMJ, and MPN price change. Data by YCharts. When MLPs were red hot in 2014, Credit Suisse's MLP ETN rose faster than large-cap-dominated ETFs and ETNs. When investors turned cold on MLPs and the energy sector as a whole in 2015, it declined faster and to a greater degree than other ETFs and ETNs. This is typical of any investment with more small-cap exposure.  A current annualized yield of about 6.5% makes this the lowest-yielding MLP ETF or ETN on the list, primarily due to its focus on smaller companies. It is thus a better holding for the investor who wants to own MLPs for capital appreciation resulting from fluctuations in energy prices, increased drilling activity, or the resulting increased demand for energy transportation. Before you buy an MLP ETF or ETN There are a few things you should know before diving headfirst into MLPs for their high dividend yields. First, although Kinder Morgan is largely viewed as the bellwether for the MLP industry, it changed its structure to a C corporation in 2015, and thus it isn't included in many MLP ETFs and ETNs. That might be fine if you're a purist about corporate structure, but while Kinder Morgan isn't structured as an MLP, its core business is very much MLP-like. Investors who want to own the whole industry might want to buy Kinder Morgan on the side. Second, the tax benefits that MLP investors enjoy from buying MLP shares individually do not translate into ETFs or ETNs. When you own an MLP share directly, a portion of your distribution can be a return of capital, which reduces your cost basis and results in the deferral of taxes until you sell your shares of the MLP. Distributions from the Alerian MLP ETF are treated as dividends after a layer of corporate taxes, while income earned from shares of JPMorgan Alerian MLP ETN and Credit Suisse X-Links Cushing 30 MLP Infrastructure ETN are treated as ordinary interest income.  Put simply, MLP ETFs and ETNs negate many of the reasons why investors want to own MLPs in the first place. Investors who intend to hold MLPs for a long time would likely be better off owning a diversified portfolio of individual MLPs in a taxable account rather than an MLP ETF or ETN in a taxable or tax-deferred account like a 401(k) or IRA. Ultimately, it comes down to how much you're willing to pay for convenience. ETFs and ETNs make investing in MLPs much easier than investing in individual MLPs at the expense of some lost tax advantages. Jordan Wathen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

"I hope the next president, she reaches across the aisle," Dimon, said at a conference sponsored, according to Bloomberg. Clinton's main presidential competitor is Republican nominee Donald Trump — so unless the banking executive is predicting a victory for Green Party nominee Jill Stein (who is averaging low single digits in polls), then his use of the feminine pronoun indicates he is expecting the former Secretary of State will win the White House. Dimon's comment was met with "loud applause," Bloomberg reported. Clinton is averaging a multi-point lead in national polls: 6.9 percentage points in a four-way race, and 6.4 points head-to-head against Trump, according to RealClearPolitics. In May, Dimon told CNBC that the presidential candidates should stop their "denigration" and "finger-pointing," and get down to the business of uniting the nation. "If the next president does the right things around immigration, corporate and individual tax reform, [and] infrastructure spending, America would be booming," Dimon said at the time. "That boom would help the people who need it the most, the people at the bottom of the ladder."

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Oct 17, 2016 at 9:37AM Image source: Getty Images.  Concerns about a recession have been rippling through the market since the beginning of the year when the stock market entered a correction and oil prices were at rock-bottom levels. JPMorgan Chase predicted that there was a 67% chance of the U.S. hitting a recession by the end of 2017,  while the big banks generally agreed that 20% of the country was entering a recession, defined as two straight quarters of negative growth, this year. That didn't happen. Oil prices have recovered somewhat, and the S&P 500 is back near record highs. Strong job growth has continued -- with the country near full employment and the unemployment rate at 5%. Still, after seven years of expansion, cyclical forces are likely to send the economy into a recession at some point in the next few years -- the longest economic expansion in the modern era was the decade-long tech-boom in the 1990s. For investors looking to protect themselves from a potential recession, here are four stocks to consider. 1. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) The social networking leader may seem like an odd choice for a recession, but the company has as bulletproof a business model as any other and the job loss and downtime that come during a recession is only likely to promote the use of a service many already view as an easy diversion or a time waster. Of course, monthly average users are nice but that alone won't drive Facebook's business. The company needs to bring in advertising dollars, and while some businesses cut ad budgets during an advertising downturn, there is significant evidence that doing so damages a brand long term. Just as Facebook has a unique opportunity to add new users during a recession, so brands have a chance to increase market share and customer loyalty by maintaining their marketing budgets, especially with an essential service. Rival Alphabet was able to maintain positive revenue and earnings growth during the last recession. 2. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) A high-priced growth stock like Netflix may be the opposite of what's generally considered a defensive recession-proof stock, but there are a number of reasons why the leading video streamer could thrive during a recession. Like Facebook, the company offers an easy escape for those who may be struggling in the job market or have additional free time. Notably, movie theaters were some of the few businesses that boomed during the Great Depression as Americans sought escapist entertainment. Netflix has the ability to offer a similar benefit during a downturn, and it has a strong value proposition at a price of just $10 per month, compared to cable packages that now cost on average more than $100 a month. If tough times hit, it's easy to see how millions of Americans may decide to cut the cord and get a Netflix subscription instead. Furthermore, Netflix could see benefits on the cost side of the equation as prices for content could easily come down as competition among peers decreases and producers become more eager to make deals and bring in the extra income that comes with a streaming contract. All in all, Netflix could emerge as a big winner during a recession. During the last recession, the company continued to grow revenue and earnings at a fast pace, and the stock barely flinched. 3. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Wal-Mart is well regarded by the market as a strong stock to own during the recession. The retail giant has staked its reputation on Everyday Low Prices and is well known among consumers for its price competitiveness. The company tends to cater to a low- and middle-income population, but during a recession, its potential shopper base can swell as customers who might ordinarily spend their money somewhere else flock to Wal-Mart to save. As a Dividend Aristocrat that has raised its quarterly payout every year for 41 consecutive years, the company has upheld its commitment to increase shareholder returns. It now offers a dividend yield of 3%, making it the typical defensive stock that investors turn to during a recession. The stock also has a beta of just 0.1, meaning there's little correlation between its performance and the broader market's. The stock has also done well during the market pullbacks in the past. During the correction early this year, Wal-Mart was actually one of the few stocks that continued to gain as investors assumed it was a good bet during a potential downturn. Similarly, the retail giant weathered the 2008-2009 recession much better than the broader market. 4. Portfolio Recovery Associates (NASDAQ:PRAA) Looking for a stock that actually directly benefits from tough times? Look no further than Portfolio Recovery Associates.  The company specializes in debt collection -- its business acquires, collects, and processes unpaid accounts receivables. A recession can create an opportunity for PRA as more accounts go unpaid. During the last recession, it was able to collect 13% more consumer debt by targeting banks and using more aggressive tactics.  It can take several years for the company to collect unpaid debts, meaning that a recession doesn't immediately provide a boon to its business, but as it creates more uncollected accounts, the company can take advantage by growing its portfolio, which can fuel its collections over the coming years.  A recession can also make debt cheaper, giving the company an additional advantage as debt prices were estimated to fall 40% during the last recession, and PRA stock also recovered quickly. Following the stock's recent drop, a recession could be just the thing to help PRA bounce back. The son of PRA Group's CEO is currently employed by The Motley Fool.

Value Traps - November Update And Watchlist (Seeking Alpha) Wunderlich’s Rommel Dionisio expects Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE: HOG) to report “relatively sluggish” retail sales trends when the company reports it Q3 results. Dionisio maintains a Hold rating on the company with a price target of $52. Encouraging Checks The analyst mentioned, however, that “with a broad slate of new product innovations unveiled to dealers recently, including the first major engine redesign in 18 years, recent dealer feedback we have received from our most recent channel checks have been encouraging.” Dionisio expects Harley Davidson’s U.S. momentum to potentially improve over the next several months against the backdrop of a moderating competitive promotional environment. Related Link: Jefferies Initiates Coverage On Harley-Davidson At Hold The analyst stated that he could get more bullish on the stock if the company sees a rebound in its market share, along with improved industry sell-through trends. Sluggish Q3 Trends “With Harley's new model year 2017 (MY17) vehicles not arriving in dealerships until late Sept., HOG saw relatively sluggish retail sell-through trends in U.S. dealerships for most of the quarter, according to feedback from our proprietary channel checks,” Dionisio cautioned. The analyst noted that the heavyweight motorcycle industry has been generally lackluster for most of 2016, although Harley Davidson’s market share had remained mostly stable, with the easing of competitive promotional pressures, as compared to a year ago. New Product Cycle “Harley completely overhauled its important Touring line for MY17 by introducing a complete redesign of its classic V-Twin engine, called the Milwaukee Eight,” according to the Wunderlich report. This introduction represents the eight time that Harley Davidson has redesigned its VTwin motor in its 113-year history, and Dionisio believes this could possibly be the most significant powerplant launch since 1998.

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Oct 17, 2016 at 9:37AM Image source: Getty Images.  Concerns about a recession have been rippling through the market since the beginning of the year when the stock market entered a correction and oil prices were at rock-bottom levels. JPMorgan Chase predicted that there was a 67% chance of the U.S. hitting a recession by the end of 2017,  while the big banks generally agreed that 20% of the country was entering a recession, defined as two straight quarters of negative growth, this year. That didn't happen. Oil prices have recovered somewhat, and the S&P 500 is back near record highs. Strong job growth has continued -- with the country near full employment and the unemployment rate at 5%. Still, after seven years of expansion, cyclical forces are likely to send the economy into a recession at some point in the next few years -- the longest economic expansion in the modern era was the decade-long tech-boom in the 1990s. For investors looking to protect themselves from a potential recession, here are four stocks to consider. 1. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) The social networking leader may seem like an odd choice for a recession, but the company has as bulletproof a business model as any other and the job loss and downtime that come during a recession is only likely to promote the use of a service many already view as an easy diversion or a time waster. Of course, monthly average users are nice but that alone won't drive Facebook's business. The company needs to bring in advertising dollars, and while some businesses cut ad budgets during an advertising downturn, there is significant evidence that doing so damages a brand long term. Just as Facebook has a unique opportunity to add new users during a recession, so brands have a chance to increase market share and customer loyalty by maintaining their marketing budgets, especially with an essential service. Rival Alphabet was able to maintain positive revenue and earnings growth during the last recession. 2. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) A high-priced growth stock like Netflix may be the opposite of what's generally considered a defensive recession-proof stock, but there are a number of reasons why the leading video streamer could thrive during a recession. Like Facebook, the company offers an easy escape for those who may be struggling in the job market or have additional free time. Notably, movie theaters were some of the few businesses that boomed during the Great Depression as Americans sought escapist entertainment. Netflix has the ability to offer a similar benefit during a downturn, and it has a strong value proposition at a price of just $10 per month, compared to cable packages that now cost on average more than $100 a month. If tough times hit, it's easy to see how millions of Americans may decide to cut the cord and get a Netflix subscription instead. Furthermore, Netflix could see benefits on the cost side of the equation as prices for content could easily come down as competition among peers decreases and producers become more eager to make deals and bring in the extra income that comes with a streaming contract. All in all, Netflix could emerge as a big winner during a recession. During the last recession, the company continued to grow revenue and earnings at a fast pace, and the stock barely flinched. 3. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Wal-Mart is well regarded by the market as a strong stock to own during the recession. The retail giant has staked its reputation on Everyday Low Prices and is well known among consumers for its price competitiveness. The company tends to cater to a low- and middle-income population, but during a recession, its potential shopper base can swell as customers who might ordinarily spend their money somewhere else flock to Wal-Mart to save. As a Dividend Aristocrat that has raised its quarterly payout every year for 41 consecutive years, the company has upheld its commitment to increase shareholder returns. It now offers a dividend yield of 3%, making it the typical defensive stock that investors turn to during a recession. The stock also has a beta of just 0.1, meaning there's little correlation between its performance and the broader market's. The stock has also done well during the market pullbacks in the past. During the correction early this year, Wal-Mart was actually one of the few stocks that continued to gain as investors assumed it was a good bet during a potential downturn. Similarly, the retail giant weathered the 2008-2009 recession much better than the broader market. 4. Portfolio Recovery Associates (NASDAQ:PRAA) Looking for a stock that actually directly benefits from tough times? Look no further than Portfolio Recovery Associates.  The company specializes in debt collection -- its business acquires, collects, and processes unpaid accounts receivables. A recession can create an opportunity for PRA as more accounts go unpaid. During the last recession, it was able to collect 13% more consumer debt by targeting banks and using more aggressive tactics.  It can take several years for the company to collect unpaid debts, meaning that a recession doesn't immediately provide a boon to its business, but as it creates more uncollected accounts, the company can take advantage by growing its portfolio, which can fuel its collections over the coming years.  A recession can also make debt cheaper, giving the company an additional advantage as debt prices were estimated to fall 40% during the last recession, and PRA stock also recovered quickly. Following the stock's recent drop, a recession could be just the thing to help PRA bounce back. The son of PRA Group's CEO is currently employed by The Motley Fool.

Consumer Confidential With David Lazarus BUSINESS Consumer Confidential Newsletter California Inc.: DMV running down rules for robot vehicles Optimus Prime DreamWorks Autonomous vehicles may not be as sophisticated as Transformers, but they're here and the DMV wants to make sure there are rules to the road. Autonomous vehicles may not be as sophisticated as Transformers, but they're here and the DMV wants to make sure there are rules to the road. (DreamWorks) David Lazarus Welcome to California Inc., the weekly newsletter of the L.A. Times Business Section. I'm Business columnist David Lazarus, and here's a rundown of upcoming stories this week and the highlights of last week. It’s earnings season, so all eyes are on corporate balance sheets. Last week, big banks reported solid numbers, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo each posting profit and sales numbers that exceeded analyst expectations. However, Wells said its third-quarter profit slipped 3% from a year earlier as the company tries to recover from that bogus-accounts scandal. LOOKING AHEAD Checking out China: Wang Jianlin, chairman of China’s Dalian Wanda Group, will speak Monday night at LACMA on “Navigating Business in China.” Wanda is based in Beijing and owns AMC Entertainment, Legendary Entertainment and is trying to buy Dick Clark Productions. Some lawmakers have raised concerns about Wanda’s investments in Hollywood. VW deal: The proposed $15-billion settlement of Volkwagen’s emissions-cheating scandal will go before U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer for final approval on Tuesday. The settlement calls for Volkswagen to spend up to $10 billion buying back or repairing about 475,000 vehicles that were rigged to cheat on air pollution tests, and paying their owners an additional $5,100 to $10,000. It also includes more than $2.5 billion for unspecified environmental mitigation and an additional $2 billion to promote zero-emissions vehicles. Breyer gave the deal preliminary OK in July. Robot cars: How will driverless vehicles be regulated in California? On Wednesday, the Department of Motor Vehicles is hosting a public workshop in Sacramento to discuss rules for autonomous vehicles. The DMV is reviewing federal guidelines on driverless cars that were released last month and is planning to release draft California regulations in the coming weeks. Currently 15 companies — including Google, Honda, Tesla and Nissan — hold permits to test driverless vehicles in California. Airport expansion: On Thursday, the city of Long Beach will hold a public hearing to discuss allowing international flights in and out of Long Beach Airport. The hearing will focus on a just-released study by Jacobs Engineering that concluded new international flights could replace existing domestic flights at Long Beach Airport without exceeding current noise limits. Some Long Beach residents have opposed the plan for fear of increased noise. The hearing begins at 6:30 p.m. at the Long Beach Gas & Oil Auditorium, 2400 E. Spring St. Jobs data: The California employment report for September will be released Friday by the state Employment Development Department. The closely followed economic indicator brought good news last month, showing that the state added a net 63,100 jobs in August and the unemployment rate held steady at 5.5%. Economists say California is nearing full employment, which is when nearly everyone who wants a job has one. That means there are fewer people in the state to recruit into the labor market. THE AGENDA Monday’s Business section looks at the cost of living. When it comes to inflation, the price might not always be right, and that has consequences for the pocketbooks of individual Americans and the nation’s economic health. But calculating the inflation rate is complicated and doesn’t always reflect what many Americans experience when they open their wallets to make a variety of everyday purchases. “It’s inherently an imprecise thing,” says Laurence Ball, an inflation expert and head of the economics department at Johns Hopkins University. “Different people consume different baskets of goods, so my personal inflation rate and your personal inflation rate could be different.” STORY LINES Here are some of the other stories that ran in the Times Business section in recent days that we’re continuing to follow: Bank CEO resigns: John Stumpf resigned as chairman and chief executive of Wells Fargo & Co., bowing to mounting criticism from lawmakers and others who said he should lose his job over revelations that bank employees created as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ authorization. Stumpf, 63, had been chief executive since 2007 and chairman of Wells Fargo’s board since 2010. Timothy J. Sloan, 56, a longtime Wells Fargo executive who was named president of the company last year, will replace Stumpf as chief executive. Affordable housing: The city of Los Angeles has won nearly $65 million in state funding to develop six affordable housing projects amid a homelessness crisis. The money allows for 553 below-market units to be built, the office of L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti announced. Nearly 350 of those residences are for formerly homeless individuals and planned for projects with supportive services. The remaining are for low-income households, who are increasingly struggling to afford a home in one of the nation’s most expensive cities. Yahoo sale: Verizon’s deal to buy Yahoo for $4.83 billion could be on shaky ground after the Internet company disclosed last month a 2014 data breach that affected at least 500 million Yahoo accounts. The breach — one of the largest in the history of cyberattacks — included user data such as email addresses, dates of birth, encrypted passwords and security answers. Yahoo said in September that it was not aware of the cyberattack when it signed the deal with Verizon in July of this year. Republic of Samsung: South Koreans sometimes call their country the Republic of Samsung, and they’re only half-joking. Samsung accounts for 20% of the country’s gross domestic product, and its footprint is everywhere. So it is with some jitters that people in Samsung’s home country have watched the crisis surrounding the company’s Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. Beastly decision: One of the nation’s most popular travel booking sites is taking a stand on animal welfare by halting the sale of tickets to attractions that let tourists ride or touch wild or endangered animals. TripAdvisor announced plans to adopt the changes by early 2017, partly in response to pressure from animal rights groups to stop selling tickets to attractions that they feel exploit animals without offering any educational value. WHAT WE’RE READING And some recent stories from other publications that caught our eye: Hard feelings: Bloomberg tells the tale of L.A. residents who traded their front lawns for gravel landscaping. A company called Turf Terminators that specialized in such transitions is accused by some of creating eyesores. “My yard just looks worse than ever,” one says. Chat bots: The New York Times explores so-called conversation computing (think Siri) and the challenge of finding just the right voice. “Choosing a voice has implications for design, branding or interacting with machines. A voice can change or harden how we see each other.” A fitter Twitter? NPR asks if Twitter, now reportedly up for sale, would do best as a nonprofit. “In the second quarter it lost more than $100 million — so perhaps it already is a nonprofit.” Not so sweet: In yet another illustration of the insane U.S. drug market, the Wall Street Journal observes that insulin prices are soaring, not just because manufacturers are boosting list prices, but also because industry middle men “demand higher rebates in exchange for including the drug on their preferred-drug lists.” Tough gig: The New Yorker profiles Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump’s campaign manager and spokeswoman. “Running Donald Trump’s campaign is like being the drummer in Spinal Tap: Those who take the position tend to disappear in mysterious circumstances.” SPARE CHANGE To what was the New Yorker referring with that Spinal Tap reference? Why, to this, of course. As the band’s David St. Hubbins points out: “Dozens of people spontaneously combust each year. It’s just not widely reported.” For the latest money news, go to www.latimes.com/business. Until next time, I'll see you in the Business section. David Lazarus' column runs Tuesdays and Fridays.

Equities in the Middle East declined the most in the world as companies from Emirates NBD PJSC to Alinma Bank reported earnings that missed analysts’ forecasts. Chinese shares denominated in US dollars dropped the most in nine months on concern the yuan will depreciate further. Turkish bond yields headed for an almost three-month high and the lira weakened the most in emerging markets on speculation a rate cut expected Thursday may be bigger than previously forecast. JPMorgan Chase & Company downgraded emerging-market stocks to neutral from overweight, citing “an opportunity to book in some profits.” Investors’ appetite for risk has diminished with the futures market indicating a two-thirds probability of a US interest-rate hike in December and Republican candidate Donald Trump pledging to renegotiate trade deals if he wins the November 8 presidential elections. China’s third-quarter gross domestic product data will be closely watched on Wednesday after exports fell in September. “There is a bit of caution ahead of the last US presidential debate and concerns about how much growth is slowing in China,” said Per Hammarlund, the chief emerging-market strategist at SEB in Stockholm, who favours ruble bonds and the Brazilian real. “Investors are waiting for a new catalyst to restart the rally, which has stalled.” Trump will face Democrat Hillary Clinton in the third and final presidential debate on Wednesday, as part of an acrimonious campaign that has made investors nervous over America’s future relationship with the world, including deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index slid 0.6 percent to 892.05 at 11:37 a.m. in London, paring its gains this year to 12 percent. The currencies gauge fell 0.4 percent, trimming its 2016 rally to 5.3 percent. Yet most investors including JPMorgan point to improving outlook for emerging markets in the medium term. US exchange-traded funds that invest in developing nations witnessed inflows for a 20th successive week, adding $23.5 billion cumulatively. -With assistance from Liau Y-Sing and Choong En Han.

Reuters has not verified the newspaper reports, and cannot vouch for their accuracy. New items are marked with (*). For a complete list of diary events in Italy please click on . POLITICS Florence, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi attends meeting on the Italian language. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced his 2017 budget plan on Saturday, hoping to persuade the European Commission to approve its minimal reduction in the budget deficit next year while avoiding unpopular belt-tightening. La Repubblica newspaper said on Sunday without naming sources that the Commission warned it would not approve the budget if Renzi does not lower the deficit target. The paper said the Commission could also revoke flexibility it had allowed Italy in 2015-16. Industry Minister Carlo Calenda told Corriere della Sera on Sunday that Italy would not "arm wrestle" with Brussels over the budget. "As ever, there will be discussions about single measures and tenths of percentage points, but in the end the budget will pass," Calenda said. ECONOMY ISTAT releases August foreign trade data (0800 GMT). DEBT Treasury starts offer of new October 2024 'BTP Italia' inflation-linked bond reserved to retail investors; ends on Oct. 19 barring early closure. A referendum vote Italy will hold on Dec. 4 on the government's constitutional reform could easily feed market volatility, the head of public debt Maria Cannata said on Friday. (*) Cannata said the Treasury expects gross debt issuance to total around 375 billion euros this year. COMPANIES MONTE DEI PASCHI DI SIENA, The Italian bank on Friday gave a clean bill of health to its newly appointed chief executive, Marco Morelli, saying he met good repute criteria for his position. MPS said on Saturday it had received a non-binding proposal on Oct. 13 from former Industry Minister Corrado Passera, presenting an alternative plan to boost the lender's capital, and had given its CEO a mandate to analyse it further. The bank's board may discuss the proposals at a meeting on Tuesday, a source told Reuters. MPS has given a mandate to Lazard to discuss Passera's plan with his advisers, Il Sole 24 Ore reported on Sunday. Passera's ideas could be merged with a turnaround project arranged by JPMorgan already underway at the troubled bank if Passera can bring in investors to inject capital, Il Sole said, adding that the former minister could be appointed chairman of the bank if the two plans are merged. Il Messaggero said on Saturday the bank is in talks with Arab sovereign funds including that of Qatar to find an "anchor investor" that can help attract more investors to follow. A source told Reuters earlier this month talks with a sovereign wealth fund had fallen through. Bank of Italy Director General Salvatore Rossi rejected a suggestion that JPMorgan had a monopoly in Italy, telling an interviewer on SkyTG24 on Sunday, "I don't think so at all", and adding JPMorgan was an adviser to MPS. BANCA POPOLARE DI MILANO, BANCO POPOLARE , UBI BANCA Shareholders in both banks approved their merger on Saturday, giving the final green light to the creation of Italy's third-largest bank by assets. A majority of 99.5 percent of Banco Popolare shareholders and 71.8 percent of BPM shareholders backed the deal. Shares in the two lenders had rallied on Friday as investors bet shareholders would approve the merger, which is set to be the first prompted by reforms the government introduced early last year to promote tie-ups and boost bank profitability. Banco Popolare is working on the sale of a 650 million euro bad loan portfolio which it expects to close by the end of the year, its CEO said on Saturday. Bank of Italy Director General Salvatore Rossi told SkyTG24 on Sunday that the merger was "obviously positive", although many had expected the new law to prompt more such deals. BPM, POSTE ITALIANE, ANIMA HOLDING BPM said on Friday Poste had decided not to renew a shareholder pact over asset manager Anima after it expires on April 17, 2016. A source close to the matter said the decision stemmed from Poste's desire to strengthen its role over Anima in relation to possible transactions both in the short- and long-term. A consortium comprising Poste, Anima and state lender CDP is in the running for UniCredit's asset manager Pioneer. UNICREDIT, PZU BANK PEKAO Italy's biggest bank said on Saturday it was in talks with Polish insurer WZU and development fund Polski Fundusz Rozwoju about selling its Bank Pekao unit, but there was no certainty these would lead to a deal. Separately, state-run PZU said it had started negotiations with the Italian bank over buying Bank Pekao. (*) FIAT CHRYSLER AUTOMOBILES Canadian manufacturing workers at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles voted on Sunday to approve a tentative labour agreement with the automaker, their union said, averting a strike and clearing the way for talks with Ford Motor. Tougher European car emissions tests being introduced in the wake of the Volkswagen scandal are about to bring surprising consequences: bigger engines.

(NYSE: JPM) reported third-quarter results last Friday, the bank’s chief financial officer said on the conference call that JPMorgan would “pull back” on auto loans with repayment periods of 84 months or more. The bank sees more risk from these very long-term auto loans, based on “where we are in the cycle.” The first-quarter average loan amount for a new car was $30,032, and the average term of a loan was 68 months. And the lower a buyer’s credit score, the longer the average loan term. Borrowers with higher credit scores take shorter term loans, while those with lower credit terms take longer term loans, according to a report from Experian published in August. The report also noted that the average loan rate on a $30,000 car loan in the first quarter was $4.79%. The advantage to the buyer of a longer term is a lower monthly payment. The disadvantage is that the borrower pays more in interest charges. Here’s a look at how much interest a car buyer pays on a $30,000 loan at 4.79% with the specified term: 36 months = $896/month for a total finance charge of $2,267 48 months = $688/month for a total finance charge of $3,025 60 months = $563/month for a total finance charge of $3,795 72 months = $480/month for a total finance charge of $4,577 84 months = $421/month for a total finance charge of $5,369 96 months = $377/month for a total finance charge of $6,173 As the borrower is paying off the loan, the value of the car depreciates. That means that it takes longer for the borrower to establish any equity in the vehicle. If the borrower defaults on a seven-year or eight-year loan, chances are higher that the car is worth less than the amount remaining to be repaid on the loan. Even JPMorgan can’t make money on a deal like that, and with record high new car buying, the number of used cars on the market is growing and lowering the value of used cars even more. It’s no wonder, then, that the bank wants out of the longest-term auto loan business, and it won’t be too surprising if other lenders follow suit. We looked earlier this year at whether a seven-year or eight-year loan was a reasonable option for a new car buyers and concluded that if the monthly payment on a five-year loan was a little too much for your budget, it might be wiser to look for a cheaper car than to take out a longer term loan. That still appears to be good advice.

Finance Search Sat, Nov 19, 2016, 4:23 AM AEDT - Australia Markets closed Global stocks stumble ahead of earnings, ECBBy John Biers | AFP – Mon, Oct 17, 2016 10:37 PM AEDT Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo The British pound's big jump weighed on London's benchmark FTSE 100 index Global stocks mostly retreated Monday as investors girded for a trove of earnings reports from US and European companies and a European Central Bank monetary policy meeting. Caution was the rule with bourses falling in New York, Europe and most of Asia. Besides uncertainty about earnings and the ECB, analysts pointed to the drag from lower oil prices and edginess ahead of the US presidential election. "The burden of proof lies with the bulls to demonstrate that the market can in fact move higher with all the various economic and political headwinds that we are currently facing," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities. ECB chief Mario Draghi will be under pressure this week to clarify the bank's stimulus plans after investors were spooked by talk of an end to its massive bond-buying program. Europe's main equities markets ended the day on the back foot, with Paris down 0.5 percent and Frankfurt 0.7 percent. London's FTSE 100 index fell 0.9 percent and the pound remained under pressure amid reports of divisions between British finance minister Philip Hammond and other cabinet members over how the country should proceed with its exit from the EU, with some suggesting he may resign. US stocks also pulled back, with the S&P 500 sliding 0.3 percent despite another better-than-expected earnings result from a big bank, in this case, Bank of America. Bank of America gained 0.3 percent after it reported that third-quarter net profit rose 6.6 percent to $4.5 billion, easily topping analyst expectations. Last week, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo all bested expectations. - Low expectations - Still, investor sentiment is skittish due to an "earnings recession" with the S&P 500 expected to notch its fifth straight quarter of declining operating profits, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S&P Global. Intel, McDonald's, General Electric and Microsoft will report later this week. The low expectations open the possibility for a positive surprise. Netflix fell 1.7 percent prior to its earnings release late Monday, but surged nearly 20 percent after-hours after the company reported strong subscriber growth. "We will certainly have a better gauge of market sentiment a few days from now than we do right now," said James. In Tokyo, the Nikkei climbed 0.3 percent, with major exporters were lifted by a rally in the dollar against the yen. However, the dollar pulled back later in the day against the yen and euro. Omer Esiner, analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, said foreign exchange traders viewed comments Friday from Fed Chair Janet Yellen highlighting the importance of running a "high-pressure economy" as suggesting interest rates in the US may "rise at a slower pace compared to previous Fed tightening cycles." - Key figures around 2100 GMT - New York - DOW: DOWN 0.3 percent at 18,086.40 (close) New York - S&P 500: DOWN 0.3 percent at 2,126.50 (close) New York - Nasdaq: DOWN 0.3 percent at 5,199.82 (close) London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.9 percent at 6,947.55 points (close) Frankfurt - DAX 30: DOWN 0.7 percent at 10,503.57 (close) Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 0.5 percent at 4,450.23 (close) EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 0.7 percent at 3,008.72 (close) Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.3 percent at 16,900.12 (close) Hong Kong - Hang Seng: DOWN 0.8 percent at 23,037.54 (close) Shanghai - Composite: DOWN 0.7 percent at 3,041.17 (close) Euro/dollar: UP at $1.1001 from $1.0974 Friday Dollar/yen: DOWN at 103.88 yen from 104.16 yen Pound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2182 from $1.2193 Euro/pound: UP at 90.31 pence from 90.01 pence Oil - West Texas Intermediate: DOWN 41 cents at $49.94 a barrel Oil - Brent North Sea: DOWN 43 cents at $51.52 a barrel @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Water fight could drench backpacker billAAP A stoush over water reform could sink the government's hopes of getting its backpacker tax through parliament. … VW to cut 30,000 jobs, 23,000 in GermanyAAP Kogan welcomes prospect of AmazonAAP Brazil judge to hear Samarco mine homicide casesAFP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7342 -0.0073 -0.99% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.5954 -0.0015 -0.25% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.6932 -0.0045 -0.64% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Golden pheasant Health insurance ISIS Melbourne Cheap international flights 457 visa program Mobile phone Leonard Cohen Adelaide Accommodation Brendan Dassey iPad Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Latino Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox Business Home Markets Politics Features Personal Finance Media & Advertising Business Leaders Technology FBN TV SHOWS ANCHORS & REPORTERS SCHEDULE VIDEO Search Visa CEO Charlie Scharf to resign ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More Visa CEO Charlie Scharf to resign Published October 17, 2016 Business Leaders Dow Jones Newswires Facebook Twitter Print Visa Inc. said Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf is resigning his post after advising the board that he can no longer spend enough time in San Francisco "to do the job effectively."  Continue Reading Below The San Francisco-based payments network said Mr. Scharf will be replaced by Alfred Kelly, 58, a member of Visa's board and a former president at American Express Co. In an interview, Mr. Scharf said his departure is connected to a need to be closer to his family in New York.  "I think to do this job properly you need to be committed to spending the appropriate amount of time in San Francisco. Given my personal situation, I don't feel that I can do that right now," he said.  In a memo to Visa employees Monday, Mr. Scharf noted that his daughters, parents and extended family are all on the East Coast. Before taking the Visa job, Mr. Scharf lived in New York.  "I love working and running this great global company and I am sad to have reached the conclusion that I should step down, but running a San Francisco based company just doesn't work for me personally right now and wouldn't be fair to Visa," Mr. Scharf said in a news release. Mr. Scharf also will step down from Visa's board of directors.  Mr. Scharf, 51 years old, took the helm of Visa in November 2012 after spending most of his career in the banking industry, including a seven-year stint running the enormous retail-banking division of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. During Mr. Scharf's tenure, Visa's stock generated a total return including dividends of 144% versus 64% for the S&P 500.  Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT The payments industry has expanded aggressively into digital channels during Mr. Scharf's time at Visa. He also has had to navigate an often-tense relationship with some of the nation's largest merchants, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc.  Last year, Visa bought its European counterpart Visa Europe for more than $20 billion in a long-awaited deal that brought the payment network's global operations under one roof.  In an interview, Mr. Kelly said he feels well-prepared to take on the Visa job even though he has technically been out of the industry for some time. Earlier this year, Mr. Kelly was named CEO of Intersection, a technology and media company behind an initiative to bring public Wi-Fi to New York City.  "My [Visa] board service has allowed me to stay enormously close to an industry that I stayed almost 2 1/2 decades in prior to this," Mr. Kelly said. Since leaving AmEx he also served as the CEO of the 2014 NY/NJ Super Bowl Host Committee and as chairman of the 2015 Papal visit to New York City.  Visa processes credit-card and debit-card payments on behalf of the nation's banks and merchants. It doesn't set interest rates or issue cards. The company has a market value of $190 billion, more than one-third larger than rival MasterCard Inc.  Robert W. Matschullat, Visa's independent chairman, described Mr. Scharf in a statement as a "visionary CEO, highly successful by any set of metrics."  Mr. Kelly will join the company on Oct. 31 as CEO-designate. Mr. Scharf will serve as an adviser to Mr. Kelly starting on Dec. 1 for several months.  "We are thrilled to have found someone with Al's expertise and knowledge to take Visa to even greater heights," Mr. Matschullat said in the statement.  Mr. Scharf said he approached the board in mid-September to advise them that he was considering stepping down, and then submitted his resignation on Monday morning.  Visa was scheduled to hold a conference call with Wall Street analysts and investors later on Monday. The company is slated to report quarterly earnings on Oct. 24.  Fox Business Markets Politics Features FBN TV About Fox Business Channel Finder Advertise With Us Jobs Internships New Terms of Use (What's new) New Privacy Policy FAQ Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Accessibility Statement Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

 6 memorable leadership lessons from the financial giant J.P. Morgan Áine Cain Oct. 17, 2016, 3:37 PM 11,056 facebook linkedin twitter email print J.P. Morgan hated to be photographed due to his rosacea. Wikimedia Today, John Pierpont Morgan is remembered as one of the greatest bankers in American history. In his time, he was called the "Jupiter of Wall Street." He was born into the Morgan banking dynasty in 1837. Throughout the Progressive Era, he dominated the corporate world. Morgan founded the banking institution J.P. Morgan & Co. in 1871, which was acquired by Chase Manhattan Bank to become JPMorgan Chase in 2000. Today, JP Morgan Chase is the largest bank in the US. Over the course of his career, Morgan helped form or support many companies that still exist today, including General Electric, the U.S. Steel, and AT&T. When he died in 1913 at the age of 75, it was revealed that he was worth around $80 million — according to legend, John D. Rockefeller remarked, "And to think he wasn't even a rich man!" upon reading the figure, according to Jean Strouse's article for the New York Times. He dominated the financial and industrial world through the 19th century. Morgan consolidated numerous companies and even regulated entire industries, like steel and railroads, as Morgen Witzel writes in "Fifty Key Figures in Management." A study of his life also reveals a number of interesting lessons to be learned from his example. Here are six lessons in leadership we can learn from J.P. Morgan: 1. Trust matters Morgan realized the value of an honest reputation. As Chris Farrell reported for Bloomberg, one of Morgan's most famous quotes came about toward the end of his life. He was testifying before a Congressional committee in 1912 when he was asked if commercial credit was based on money or property. "The first thing is character," he responded. "Before money or anything else. Money cannot buy it.… A man I do not trust could not get money from me on all the bonds in Christendom. I think that is the fundamental basis of business." 2. Setbacks happen J.P. Morgan and Company organized numerous different companies, from General Electric to the Erie Railroad. However, not all of his ventures worked out. In fact, Morgan was roundly defeated on certain occasions. One notable incident came about while the banker was trying to break into the London Underground market by Charles Tyson Yerkes, according to "Robber Baron" by John Franch. Yerkes apparently sabotaged Morgan's attempt to secure permission to build lines to compete with his own operation. 3. Things change — and that's not a bad thing In one famous incident, when asked by a passerby what the stock market was going to do next, Morgan responded simply: "It will fluctuate." Unfortunately, Morgan probably never quite said that — according to Barry Popik's research, the earliest appearance of the quote dates back to 1934, decades after the man's death. However, Morgan's ability to both adapt to and facilitate change was clear throughout his career. He was frequently able to seize failing entities and "Morganize" them, as Heather Timmons reported for Bloomberg: "He would take over problem companies, flush out incompetent managers, and appoint people he trusted. Over time, many of the companies would recover and become profitable, keeping capital flowing into other Morgan deals." 4. Having a side passion is a good idea Don't let anyone talk you out of majoring in a "useless" subject. J.P. Morgan himself studied the humanities, receiving a degree in art history from the University of Göttingen, according to "J.P. Morgan's Way" by the editors of New World City. Later on, he was a major player in the establishment of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. 5. Keep things in perspective Morgan dodged a potential deadly situation in 1912, when he canceled his reservation on the disastrous maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic at the very last second. According to the Smithsonian, in the wake of the tragedy, he told a reporter from the New York Times that, "Monetary losses amount to nothing in life. It is the loss of life that counts. It is that frightful death." 6. Develop strong connections within your industry Today, Morgan is remembered for bailing out the US government during the Panic of 1907. Failed speculation and the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake triggered a series of runs on banks across America. In an interview with UVA professor Robert F. Bruner for the Smithsonian, Abigail Tucker finds that Morgan soothed the panic by calling upon his "deep and extensive relations throughout the financial and business communities." He gathered top financiers in his home on 34th street, created working groups, and determined which institutions to save and which ones to allow to die off.

Cookbook question A few days ago, I had to chair a public meeting with about 50 people in the crowd. A big part of chairing that meeting was handling a discussion on a topic that upset a lot of people centering around the sale of a property. There were some people in the crowd that bitterly opposed it and others that were strongly in favor of it. Chairing that meeting did not seem appealing at all. There was the issue of standing up in front of a crowd. There was the issue of talking about a challenging problem. There was the issue of making sure that no one got too upset and that everyone had their voices heard. Rather than stressing out about it, I prepared for it. I talked to people with differing opinions on the issue. I asked all of them to tell me what points they most wanted to make sure were covered in the meeting. So, what I did right at the start is that I laid out that research. I talked openly about all of the concerns I had, from all sides, and basically laid out all of the main points at the start. I expressed the feelings of both sides as well, pointing out that some people have a historical and meaningful attachment to the property, while others do not. I let everyone who wanted to speak have their time on the floor, almost without limit. I stopped anyone who interrupted. The thing is, no one got upset. It didn’t turn ugly, which was something I was concerned about. The only time I sensed that it might turn ugly, I stopped it immediately and pointed out that just because different people care about things at different levels doesn’t mean that they don’t care and it doesn’t mean that they deserve to be attacked. The meeting went very well. I attribute it to one thing far above everything else: preparation. I learned about the sides that would be presented going in. I knew what made people emotionally invested in the issue on all sides and did my absolute best to understand those viewpoints. I nipped negative talk in the bud. I did a lot of those things because I visualized them happening in advance and also visualized how I would handle it. If you’re about to do something scary, prepare. Think about the outcomes that might happen and what you’ll do to handle them. Visualize them in your head as they might happen and visualize yourself handling them effectively. If you’re unsure how to handle things, talk to a mentor or to someone you trust. That’s the best you can do and, usually, that’s enough. Q1: Figuring out bills in collection Unexpected divorce. Bank accounts drained by ex. Medical billing in collections. Financially stable and wanting to get collections paid off. 1. How do I find out what is in collections? 2. How do I pay without getting ripped off? – Bradley The best way to find out what debts you have, how much you owe on them, and how late they are is to grab a copy of your credit report. The federal government gives you a free copy of your report each year; you can get it at AnnualCreditReport.com. When you get a copy of your report, it will list all of your currently owed debts along with their current balance. You can then use that as a checklist of sorts to get them all paid off. You can negotiate your debts, of course, particularly if the debt has already been sold to a debt collector. If that’s the case, they’ll often negotiate with you so that you can pay a lower amount. Carrie Smith wrote a very nice article for The Simple Dollar a while back about negotiating with collectors that will help you with this process. Q2: Finding a better budgeting system I will be graduating in May 2017 and already have a job lined up where I will be making far above the average salary (~90k). Thankfully my parents have been able to help me pay tuition, and lifeguarding/internships have payed for my living expenses while at school. So I have ZERO debt, which I know is a great starting place. However, as I move from LA to Seattle and start working I feel like I will have a harder time keeping my budget in check. Throughout college I have used a simple spreadsheet with various categories that I manually tally up each month. For the most part, it was simple to stay within my set boundaries because all of my friends spending habits were similarly cheap and I did not have many major reasons to purchase more than the basics. If I did go over a category in a month, I would just reduce my future spending(which did not always work perfectly). I know that after graduation I will likely have more expenses due to relocating, the new jobs needs, and switching stuff like insurance and phone bills from family plans to personal, which will make having a manual spreadsheet harder especially before I know the baseline of what I will be spending. Is there a product that you would recommend for budgeting that is easier than going over my statements at the end of the month and adding everything up? Something similar to the enveloping method, but with debit/credit cards, so that I have a better idea of my spending throughout the month? Also, how would you go about creating a budget for a new lifestyle? I do not plan to go crazy and increase my spending to match my income increase, but I definitely will change some aspects by a somewhat unknown amount and am unsure as to how to deal with that. – Bonnie My preferred budgeting program is You Need a Budget 4. This is the still-supported previous version. They have since moved on to a subscription version that I am not a big fan of, mostly due to the idea of subscription model software for personal budgeting. I have used YNAB 4 for years and it is hands-down my favorite personal budgeting program. It matches up really well with the features you’re looking for. I think the best way to build a budget after a major life change is to spend a few months just being a little careful with your spending and then looking at how much you’re actually spending. Spend like you’re going to spend going forward, but don’t just throw money around foolishly. Your actual spending patterns should be the guide for your budget, because the most effective thing a budget can do is keep continued lifestyle inflation in check. YNAB can really help with this process. It functions very nicely as an expense tracking program and you can then use all of that data to build a great budget. Bonnie has a second question. Q3: Finding a better credit card Another thing I would like your opinion on is the best rewards credit card to get. I have an account with Wells Fargo currently, that I have had since I was 16, but it has no cash back, points, or miles. I also think that getting another credit card will help me build credit (my FICO score is around 780 and says it is impacted due to lack of accounts and revolving balances). I think I want cash back, rather than points or miles because it seems more straightforward and less restrictions. I have seen the Simple Dollar promote Chase Sapphire and Freedom cards in the past, which seem like pretty good cards. But there are tons of options out there that all seem very similar and hard to compare. Does it really matter much which I choose once they have the same % cash back and no yearly fee? And having never actually applied for a card, how likely is it that I am accepted/rejected and would that factor into which one to try for? Obviously there are some that are more selective than others. Also, does the timing effect me much? Someone told me to get one a few months before I graduate so that when I have credit checks for a car loan or an apartment enough time has passed to benefit my credit. – Bonnie I think that Chase Sapphire and Chase Freedom are both great credit cards. I think they’re both perfectly fine for general use. Having said that, I think that if there’s a particular retailer that you use a lot, whether it’s a store like Target or a gas station like BP, your best choice is to get the Visa or MasterCard associated with that chain. Almost every time, the discounts associated with that card offer benefits related to that chain that are far better than a general use card; however, the benefits don’t really accrue at places besides that chain. I do recommend with the general idea of getting a credit card and using it responsibly to improve your credit. I think that the two recommended cards are great general use cards for most people. I also think that a retailer-specific Visa or MasterCard makes a great complement for use at your most-frequently-visited retailer, and might be the only card you need if most of your purchases are at that retailer. Bonnie has a third question. Q4: Car loan concerns Lastly, I do not currently have a car but will need one for my job. I will not have the cash upfront to buy one before I start working, but I think that with my future salary I could quickly pay off a car loan. I plan on getting a late-model used car as you and many other people have advised. Is it better to get the loan and throw all my excess money at it for a few months until it is payed off? Or is it beneficial to keep such a car loan and pay it off over its full (or near full) term with my excess money going towards other savings? I assume this also depends on the amount and interest of loan which I don’t know, so feel free to use average numbers. – Bonnie Unless the interest rate is extremely low – say, below 2% – you’re better off paying the debt down rapidly. There are a lot of different philosophies on paying down debt, but my belief is that unless the loan is almost interest free, you should be eliminating it quickly because of the personal freedom you get from having fewer bills each month. Having said that, as soon as you pay off that car, you should start making normal car payments to a savings account. Putting $200 a month aside when you’ve been throwing much more than that at a car payment each month won’t be a big deal. Why do this? After several years, you’ll have more than enough in that savings account to simply buy a very nice late model used car right out of pocket. $200 a month for eight years into a 1% interest savings account adds up to almost exactly $20,000 saved, which is going to be perfect for your next car. Q5: Roth IRAs and spouses Concerning Roths: If I have $6,000 each year to distribute between my and my wife’s Roth IRA’s, is there a most efficient way to do so? For example: Should I contribute the full $5500 to mine and then drop the remaining $500 in my wife’s, or is it beneficial numbers-wise to do an even $3,000-$3,000 split, or somewhere in between? I’m sure there’s a formula for this, but I’m not sure where to start. – Jerry My recommendation is to do it equally. Assuming that you’re married to each other for the rest of your lives, it really makes no difference how you split it up (assuming that the investment portfolio and management company are identical). In the event of a divorce, it’s split up according to the judge’s ruling. Since you can choose the investment house and the exact investment for each Roth IRA, there’s not going to be any difference between the investments in each account unless you choose to make them different. My suggestion is to simply mirror them – contribute the same amount to each in the same investments. There’s no real reason to do anything else. Q6: Starting an unusual side hustle Onto my question. I am considering turning my hobby of folding origami into a small side hustle with an Etsy store. This is something I think I’d genuinely enjoy doing. I figure if I can cover the cost of the supplies I’d buy for my hobby anyway (in the neighborhood of $200/year), it will be totally worth it, and anything I might earn beyond that would be a great bonus. So I’m talking a very modest scale here, but I’m still a little intimidated by the business side of things. I’m wondering what general advice you have for starting an online side hustle? And more specifically, what would you recommend in terms of a business plan, legal structure and taxation concerns for a very small business? I might well not make enough money to have any tax liability at all, but I definitely don’t want to be caught off-guard there. I’m also wondering how to decide on a business structure, if any, either to prepare up-front or as a possible later development if it grows. Sole proprietorship? LLC? I have fears of inadvertently committing copyright infringement or something and wonder what steps I should take to protect myself and my family if for some reason I get sued. I am a career counselor in my day job, so like many professionals I’m very aware of liability issues–but I can’t tell if I’m being smart or just being paranoid when it comes to my possible side hustle. What do I need to know before I make a move? – Kelly My recommendation is to test the waters with this endeavor by leaving it as a sole proprietorship for now. That basically means you just start selling on Etsy with your personal tax ID and treat all profit as normal income. As for your concern about stealing ideas, just make your best effort at due diligence along the way. Most patterns and recipes don’t restrict you from the thing you make from that pattern, they merely restrict you from selling the pattern itself. If the business grows, you can consider forming a business structure, but at the level you’re talking about, it’s probably not worth the effort. You’re not doing anything that any reasonable person would sue over or a judge would do anything about. Q7: Saving too much? I have one question for you. Am I putting too much away in my savings account? I have 35K in a savings account in the hope this will be used towards a down payment on a house sometime. Im a single 30yr old guy and dont need a lot of space so I don’t foresee myself buying anything too large or expensive. I’m pretty confident I have more than enough for 20% down on a modest house. Im still currently putting $500 a month away in my savings and only putting $575 a month away in my employer sponsored 401k. My question is should I put less in my savings and then increase my 401k contribution to max it out? – Axel Assuming you don’t have any other debts and you have at least 20% of the cost of any house you might buy already in savings, I would definitely reduce (or eliminate) your savings contributions and move all of that to your 401(k) contribution. Honestly, though, if you’re 30, have no debt, have $35,000 saved up for a house, and are already contributing $575 a month to your 401(k), you’re in good shape. If you bump that monthly contribution up to $1,000 a month, you’re going to be in really good shape going forward and probably trending toward an early retirement. In short, provided you don’t inflate your lifestyle, you’re looking quite good financially going forward, especially given your age. Q8: Will or trust? My husband and I just had a baby and we can’t figure out what’s better for our situation, a will or a trust. We aren’t rich, but we own our home and started a college find for him as soon as we decided to get pregnant. – Denise I tend to follow the advice from CNN Money regarding whether you need a trust or not: If you have a net worth of at least $100,000 and have a substantial amount of assets in real estate, or have very specific instructions on how and when you want your estate to be distributed among your heirs after you die, then a trust could be for you. If that describes your situation, then get a trust. If it doesn’t, then you’re fine with a will. Right now, our estate plan is to split things into four pieces, with three of the pieces going to our children and a fourth going to charity. It’s a very simple estate, really, so we currently just have a will. Q9: Close to retirement at work I’m 63 and I’m close to retirement. According to my math I am going to be fine when I retire, but I’m still worried about that ~5% chance that things go wrong so I keep working to reduce the possibility of a bad outcome. My boss is doing everything in the world to encourage me to reitre as it will save money when they replace me. He wants me to spend a lot of time doing documentation and such things so they can transition really fast whenever I go. I have this sinking feeling in the back of my head that they’re going to push me out the door before long. My retirement savings is mostly in a 401(k) with a little in a Roth IRA. I am single (my wife died almost fifteen years ago of natural causes). In retirement I am going to work for Habitat for Humanity across town from my kids and grandkids as both of my children live in the same suburban area about four hours from where I live right now. I also want to do some traveling with my sister who is also single with a spouse that died recently. I’m trying to figure out how hard I should “fight” retiring and I hope you have some words of wisdom for me. – Stanley If I were you, I would listen to your heart. I’d spend time at work quietly documenting the things you take care of, but I wouldn’t make a big deal out of it. Basically, if I were you, I wouldn’t write yourself out of a job, but I would do everything possible to set yourself up so you can leave easily on your own terms. I think that, very soon, you’re going to wake up and just know that it’s time to walk away from this and do other things with your life. That day hasn’t quite come yet, but I can almost feel it coming with every word you’ve written. So, what I would do right now if I were you is continue doing my work, but use your spare time to make your transition away from the job as easy as possible for you. Another thing to consider is that your employer might give you some sort of compensation for retiring immediately. You could quietly broach the topic with your boss. A small compensation package might be enough to help you transition to retirement right now. Q10: Nearby library and bus stop? How much of a premium would you put on an apartment within 0.1 miles of a library and a bus stop and within 0.25 miles of a grocery store? It would obviously save a lot of money but the apartments are a little pricy. – Anna I think it varies a lot from person to person. Assuming you’re a single person who enjoys reading and has a job on the bus route, I think that position would save you hundreds of dollars a month. I can tell you that, if I were single again, this would basically be my ideal situation. You need to really look at your own situation, though, and decide how much those things will really save you. Will you actually use the library more if it’s 500 to 1,000 feet from your apartment door compared to, say, a couple of miles away? I can’t assess that, but I can say that I probably would if I were in that situation. Will you cook at home more if there’s a grocery store 2,000 feet away? If the grocery store had good prices, I’m pretty sure I would, and that would save me a lot of cash on food, but you may not feel the same. I also don’t know the actual difference between apartment prices. If the difference is several hundred dollars a month, I might be hesitant to make that choice. If the difference is $50 or $100 a month, I’d go for the apartment with all of the nearby features. Q11: Cost of hosting family Thanksgiving In January my mother had a stroke and although she seems to be almost fully recovered mentally, she’s still struggling with motor skill recovery. My father asked me out of the blue over the weekend if my husband and I could host our family’s Thanksgiving dinner. I don’t mind the work, but I am worried about the expense of it. I’ve been doing some estimation and I think it is going to cost us about $200 to pull off the usual style of Thanksgiving dinner that my mother always put on. We can afford it, but just barely, and the truth is that it will probably cut into our family Christmas. Help? I don’t want to say “no” but I don’t see how we can pull it off especially if this expense becomes annual. – Nancy Go to your father and say that you’ll be happy to do all of the work for everything at their house provided that they buy the ingredients. Basically, you’ll just agree to replace your mother for labor. That way, you’re not suddenly burdened with the cost of the food, but you can step up and do the work that’s needed for your extended family to continue to bond. This might also help your mother to feel as involved as she can be with the preparations and be right there for advice along the way (because, trust me, pulling off a Thanksgiving dinner for the first time will require some advice). Q12: Cookbook question What value do you get from a cookbook that you don’t get from a blog or a recipe database? Why not just look at recipes on your phone when deciding what to make or when you’re cooking? I guess to me that cookbooks seem outdated and overpriced. – Chris There are several reasons. One, the recipes in most well-regarded cookbooks are very well vetted, which means that they’re good and they work. Recipes from a blog or from a recipe aggregation site do not have any such vetting. Two, they’re incredibly nice to flip through for inspiration and bookmark when you find something interesting, and the experience is different enough than web browsing that it seems to itch different parts of the brain. Three, the pages are usually larger and easier on the eyes than a phone or a tablet and the format is much more convenient than a laptop screen. Four, they’re usually very good at explaining technique, something you don’t find in random recipes. I certainly do use many online sources for recipes and food ideas, but cookbooks definitely have a big role in my food prep process. For me, it comes down to trust, inspiration, and convenience, things that a good cookbook can provide much better than online sources. There may come a time where electronic vetted recipe collections are delivered in a format that’s as readable and usable as a great printed cookbook, but we’re not there yet. Trust me, I’ve tried a lot of such options. The printed cookbook is still king. Got any questions? The best way to ask is to follow me on Facebook and ask questions directly there. I’ll attempt to answer them in a future mailbag (which, by way of full disclosure, may also get re-posted on other websites that pick up my blog). However, I do receive many, many questions per week, so I may not necessarily be able to answer yours.

The iShares US Broker-Dealers & Securities Exchanges ETF (NYSEArca: IAI) increased 9.5% over the past three months while the S&P 500 Financial Sector rose 2.0%. SEE MORE: Good News for This Wall Street ETF? The ongoing earnings season has revealed rising trading activity among big Wall Street banks, potentially signalling a end to a multi-year slump in fixed-income activity. Last week, Citigroup (NYSE: C) announced fixed-income revenue surged 35% to $3.47 billion in the third quarter and J.P. Morgan & Chase (NYSE: JPM) posted $4.33 billion from the business, Bloomberg reported. “It was a situation where we were firing on all cylinders,” Marianne Lake, JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, said. “There were a number of catalysts in the market, not just Brexit, but also central-bank actions, money-market reforms, and we had good conditions to monetize the flow and clients motivated to act.” SEE MORE: A Strong Start to Q3 Earnings Lifts Financial ETFs On Monday, Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) revealed its best third quarter for fixed-income trading in five years after a 39% jump in the business driven by rates trading and benefits from debt-underwriting, reports Laura J Keller for Bloomberg. “The revenue beat came mostly on the trading side, which was nearly $1 billion better than expected,” Chris Kotowski, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., said in a note. However, market observers warn that fixed-income trading activity could slow down during the final months of the year in line with normal seasonal trends. John Gerspach, Citigroup’s chief financial officer, said that the past two years have seen roughly 20% drops in markets revenue. “December usually is a pretty light month,” Gerspach said. “There’s certainly nothing to indicate right now that that’s going change.” IAI provides exposure to U.S. investment banks, discount brokerages and stock exchanges. Top holdings include Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), Charles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW), CME Grouop Inc Class A (NYSE: CME) and Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE: ICE). Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are slated to report third quarter earnings on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.

Its third quarter earnings per share (EPS) hit $0.41 on revenue of $20.96 billion, up from $0.38 for the same period last year and $0.36 the previous quarter, and above an expected $0.34. "Strong client activity and good expense discipline combined to drive positive operating leverage as we continue to optimize and strengthen our balance sheet," Chief Financial Officer Paul M. Donofrio said in the earnings release. "With near-record levels of capital and liquidity, as well as robust underwriting standards, Bank of America is stronger, safer and better prepared to deliver for customers and clients than probably at any time in our history." FindTheCompany | Graphiq The bank’s high performance signaled a mitigation of the uncertainty and volatility that hit global financial markets following the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union in June, when investors scrambled to reposition their government bond holdings. In the most recent quarter, Bank of America, like its competitors JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., benefitted from recent bond market strength. In its quarterly report, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank attributed much of its growth to “stronger performance globally across credit products, led by mortgages.” Its fixed income, currency and commodities trading increased 39 percent, while JPMorgan’s jumped 48 percent and Citi’s rose 35 percent. Stocks have continued to fluctuate in light of uncertainty surrounding the so-called “Brexit,” the U.S. presidential election and worries of a Deutsche Bank collapse, and Bank of America was not immune to the market’s instability. Its equity trading revenue fell 17 percent. The bank also reported its highest quarterly profits in ten years, at $4.45 billion, up from $4.42 billion for the quarter ending in June and $4.18 billion for the third quarter last year.

FindTheCompany | Graphiq The megabank’s revenue increased 3 percent, to $21.6 billion from $21 billion, according to a company press release. It held onto its title as the second largest bank in the U.S. by assets, with nearly $2.2 trillion total as of Sept. 30, second only to JPMorgan, with $2.4 trillion. Meanwhile, its expenses not related to interest payments fell 3 percent from the previous quarter, to $13.48 billion from $13.49 billion. Despite the positive report, however, Bank of America's stock dropped to $15.90 from $16.20 on Monday morning after rallying at the end of the previous week.  FindTheCompany | Graphiq     Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Latino Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox Business Home Markets Politics Features Personal Finance Media & Advertising Business Leaders Technology FBN TV SHOWS ANCHORS & REPORTERS SCHEDULE VIDEO Search Customers pile in, analysts fret as U.S. banks offer rich card awards ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More Customers pile in, analysts fret as U.S. banks offer rich card awards By By David Henry Published October 17, 2016 Markets Reuters Facebook Twitter Print NEW YORK –  Morrie Low, a 27-year-old Seattle cocktail server, has found an unlikely new source of pleasure: credit card companies. Continue Reading Below After working off card balances he built up during college, Low started collecting new cards in May specifically to reap the increasingly lucrative travel awards banks are offering to encourage spending on their cards. In August, Low snagged a new Sapphire Reserve card, from JPMorgan Chase & Co, which has become a magnet for millennials willing to pay the $450 annual fee for a sign-up bonus worth as much as $1,500 in travel, plus $300 in annual spending credits and more freebies. Now Low is planning a trip to Germany with his girlfriend on JPMorgan���s dime. "I have never been to Europe, so that is something pretty cool about this hobby," he said. The Reserve card opens up a new front in the war among banks to build up their lucrative credit card businesses. While it may be fun for customers, investors and analysts worry that battle will eat away the fat profit margins that made the sector so attractive to banks in the first place. "You have five or six big national players and they are going around killing one another," said Chris Kotowski, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT METAL CARDS RUN OUT Low illustrates the problem. JPMorgan won't know if he will become a profitable customer for another year because the up-front rewards are so great. He may drop the Reserve card before the next annual fee. He has already acquired two more cards and now is spending on those to meet their requirements for more sign-up bonuses. And he doesn���t intend to borrow on his cards. That could be bad for JPMorgan because credit card companies historically have made about three-fourths of their revenue from interest. The rest has come from fees, which are being whittled away by the rising costs of the givebacks. Still, JPMorgan executives say they are thrilled that many more young people applied for the Reserve card than they ever expected. That's especially true with millennials - people who reached adulthood around 2000 - who are the next generation of depositors and borrowers. "It has been a huge success," said Kevin Watters, the bank's chief executive for cards. The bank so underestimated the demand that it quickly ran out of its initial stock of metal cards and had to resort to plastic for a while. To make money from the card, JPMorgan has to have the right mix of customer spending, annual renewals and borrowing with repayments, said John Grund, a partner at card industry consulting firm First Annapolis. Marianne Lake, JPMorgan���s chief financial officer, declined to say how much card debt the bank needs customers to take on. ���I am not going to give you the details of our business case, but I will tell you that we obviously have a lot of experience in a number of different (card) products,��� Lake told reporters on Friday after the bank posted results. Historically, airline travel award cards have been successful, with about 50 percent of customers borrowing, said Grund. High-fee cards used by the wealthy have worked with less borrowing, but with less valuable incentives than the Reserve card. CARD WAR Like JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc also has been spending hundreds of millions of dollars to encourage additional spending and borrowing on its cards. The other two banks among the four biggest in the United States, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co, have also been looking for more card business, but less aggressively. Citigroup intensified the card war last year by giving retailer Costco Wholesale Corp such a sweet deal for running its Costco card that it took the business from American Express Co, which said the winning terms were uneconomical. Citigroup said on Friday that its Costco deal drove spending on its cards to $73 billion in the latest quarter, 57 percent higher than a year earlier. JPMorgan said spending on its cards rose 10 percent to $139 billion. On Monday, Bank of America said spending on its credit cards was up 8 percent, adjusted for some divestitures late last year. The bank's chief executive, Brian Moynihan, told analysts that "one of the great debates we have in the company" is over giving up too much, or too little, in incentives on cards. The banks do not report clear and mutually comparable figures for actual profits from cards. But executives say cards are among the most profitable of any business, with returns on equity of as much as 25 percent, about twice banks' recent overall return. Citigroup's Costco deal fueled a round of concessions by banks to renew contracts with other retailers, hotel and airline companies for co-branded cards. JPMorgan���s new deals with Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, online retailer Amazon.com and others, for example, will cut revenue by about $900 million annually, the bank said earlier this year. Now, with the Reserve card, JPMorgan has ���fundamentally changed the calculus for what makes a premium credit card,��� said Sean McQuay, who tracks card offers at online personal finance website NerdWallet.com. Citigroup, he said, needs to respond with more givebacks on its Prestige premium card. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach disagrees. The Prestige card is already a ���strong offering,��� he told reporters on Friday. JPMorgan, he said, has ���a very attractive offer on the table right now. We will see whether or not that is sustainable.��� Earlier this month, American Express increased rewards on its Platinum card, the traditional leader among high-fee cards. American Express spokeswoman Charlotte Fuller said the move was not a competitive response, but a coincidental improvement for customers. PERSONAL REDEMPTION The intense competition over card rewards has its roots in the financial crisis of 2008. Post-crisis reforms reduced the profitability of other businesses such as mortgages and capital markets trading, encouraging banks to turn to cards for profits. And, within that business, the reforms pushed banks from people with lower credit ratings toward creditworthy customers who respond to incentives. And lately, the banks have had the means to bid more for customers because loan losses have declined to record lows. At the same time, cardholders have become more savvy about working the incentives. Ivan Drucker, a New York City-based consultant to Apple computer users, recently used awards from a strategically managed mix of credit cards to travel in luxury to Finland. Drucker, 46, said he borrowed on cards at high rates in years past, but he's determined not to do it again. "For me, there's personal redemption in this," Drucker said. "They got the better of me. Now I hope to turn those tables."

After months of secret and meticulous planning, 13 employees in Wichita, Kansas, left on a Friday with phone numbers and e-mail addresses for 800 clients, and then spent a frantic weekend on the phone trying to get them to switch to their upstart. It all depended on a gift from Morgan Stanley: Years earlier, the bank had signed away its right to sue. The defectors who started the firm, 6 Meridian, were able to take clients with them thanks to an industry agreement called the Protocol for Broker Recruiting. The pact was devised in 2004 by three firms &mdash: Merrill Lynch & Co., Citigroup Inc. and UBS Group AG — in the name of reducing litigation and giving customers a choice when one big firm poached from another. Morgan Stanley, which declined to comment, joined the protocol two years later. But over the years, the protocol has had an unanticipated effect by offering a blueprint to brokers with an entrepreneurial bent: have someone set up a shell company, have the company sign the protocol, and then take over the company without fear of a lawsuit. Maneuvers like 6 Meridian's explain why the legal peace treaty now has almost 1,500 members, even though the industry has only a handful of big national players. They also help explain a curious trend. In the years since the protocol was born, the old-school “wire houses” that started the pact have lost market share as small upstarts have gained. Big defections have hit several large banks over the last two years, with Bank of America Corp. and Deutsche Bank AG each losing $3 billion teams to upstarts. Advisers are also being encouraged to leave banks by the expiration of multi-year employment contracts that many signed in the wake of the financial crisis, industry observers say. There are even websites that track the defections. The unintended consequences are straining the agreement, with some big firms like JPMorgan Chase & Co. reinterpreting it or even partly opting out. “Originally, the big boys formed the protocol and the smaller shops joined in,” said Jonathan Pollard, an employment attorney in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. “Now the ones pushing back are all big players.” Brian Hamburger, a lawyer in Englewood, New Jersey, who specializes in helping brokerage employees go independent, figures he's left his “fingerprints” on as many as one-third of protocol memberships, including 6 Meridian's. “We're working at varying stages with several multibillion-dollar teams. We expect more big deals this year,” Mr. Hamburger said. Mr. Hamburger is part of a cottage industry of business consultants, technology vendors and law firms that has cropped up to help advisers make the leap to independence. A critical part of their playbook is the tricky task of invoking the industry protocol, without running afoul of regulations or employment contracts. These advisers take advantage of language in the protocol that releases them from non-solicitation agreements and other restrictions that might otherwise land departing brokers in court. Under the protocol, advisers who move among member firms receive a waiver from employment restrictions, as long as they take with them only five key pieces of client data: names, addresses, phone numbers, e-mail addresses and account titles. The three-page agreement includes what amounts to a legal loophole, allowing new firms to join simply by submitting a one-page letter of intent. To invoke the protocol, departing advisers typically start planning months or years ahead. They hire an outside lawyer or consultant who sets up a shell company, sometimes in the name of a trusted proxy: “A college buddy or a crazy uncle,” Mr. Hamburger says. That company then joins the protocol. Soon after, typically on a Friday, the advisers resign, take ownership of the protocol firm and work through the weekend schmoozing their clients while their former colleagues do the same, like the dueling sports agents in the film “Jerry Maguire.” The Morgan Stanley advisers began talking seriously of breaking away two years ago and sped up preparations last fall as they zeroed in on software providers and office space, said 6 Meridian's chief executive officer, Margaret Dechant. Because brokerage employees aren't allowed to operate outside businesses without permission, the Wichita team turned to Hamburger to set up a company in advance and register it as a member of the protocol. Then on Friday, Sept. 9, the group resigned from Morgan Stanley and re-registered ownership of Hamburger's protocol-member company in their own names. Within a couple of hours, 6 Meridian was up and running, calls were going out to clients. “The protocol was very important” to establishing 6 Meridian, Ms. Dechant says. “We knew if we followed it to the letter, it allowed us to reach out to our clients once we left Morgan Stanley.” To avoid alerting their former employer, the group had insisted on strict secrecy throughout the breakaway process. “I got a tongue-lashing from my mother because she didn't know,” Ms. Dechant says. Even under the protocol, leaving a big brokerage with the intention to take along a large chunk of client assets is a bare-knuckled undertaking in which the slightest slip-up can spell disaster. Mr. Hamburger recalls a case in which a graphic designer posted online a mock-up of a business card for an adviser who was planning to go independent. The adviser was promptly called into a meeting with lawyers at his brokerage firm, where he immediately quit. Even afterward, he was dragged into a costly two-year regulatory dispute over whether he'd violated the prohibition against operating an undisclosed business before leaving his job. Regulators took no action against the adviser. Advisers have a strong financial incentive to leave big brokerages and go independent. Wirehouses pay advisers 40% of the fees and commissions they generate. Independents keep 100% of revenue, after covering their overhead. Wealth managers who leave traditional wire houses usually succeed in bringing well over 90% of client assets with them, says John Phoenix, who's worked on hundreds of breakaways at Envestnet, which provides services to independent wealth managers. “Advisers have seen colleagues with smaller books than them do this and have astounding success,” Mr. Hamburger said. “They think 'If this idiot can to it, I can too.' ” The defections have helped reshape the industry. So-called independent Registered Investment Advisers more than doubled their assets under management in the eight years through 2015, to $2.8 trillion, according to the consultancy Aite Group LLC. At the wire houses, by contrast, assets grew 12% during that time, to $6.4 trillion, as their market share fell steadily to one-third of the $19 trillion U.S. asset-management business. Internet brokerages have also contributed to the shift. Big firms often gripe at industry conferences about how breakaways are using the protocol, but it's unclear what, if anything, they can do about it. Even if they came up with an alternative, there is no governing body to appeal to. Besides, any renegotiation would pit them against hundreds of firms that have benefited from the rules as they are. 0 Comments What do you think?

Shares rose in premarket trade. The bank posted earnings of 41 cents a share on revenue of $21.64 billion. Profit of $4.45 billion represented a 6.6 percent gain from a year ago. Wall Street analysts had expected Bank of America to report earnings of 34 cents a share on revenue of $20.96 billion, according to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters. Bank of America reported a 14 percent rise in sales and trading revenue, helped by a 32 percent jump in fixed income trading revenue. Revenue from equities trading fell 17 percent. "I think this probably raises the bar a bit for sales and trading revenues going forward," Jeffery Harte, principal, Sandler O'Neill, said on CNBC's " Squawk Box ." But he wouldn't extrapolate such strong performance to future quarters. Stronger trading revenue helped JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup on Friday post better-than-expected earnings. Loan growth was also solid. However, Bank of America's return on average common equity was 7.3 percent, below the 10 percent general yardstick for cost of capital. "Strong client activity and good expense discipline combined to drive positive operating leverage as we continue to optimize and strengthen our balance sheet. With near-record levels of capital and liquidity, as well as robust underwriting standards, Bank of America is stronger, safer and better prepared to deliver for customers and clients than probably at any time in our history," Chief Financial Officer Paul M. Donofrio said in the earnings release. "We remain focused on delivering long-term value to shareholders," he said. "This quarter, we increased tangible book value per share by 11 percent while returning nearly $2.2 billion in capital to common shareholders." Shares of Bank of America were higher but volatile, rising more than 1.5 percent in premarket trade following the earnings release. Average total loans and leases rose 3 percent year-over-year, while average total deposits climbed 6 percent, the bank said in a presentation. Net interest income rose $0.3 billion from the third quarter last year to $10.2 billion, the bank said. The third quarter results are the first to reflect the bank's discontinued use of an accounting method known as FAS 91. The change was expected to reduce volatility in net interest income, the difference between income from interest on assets such as mortgages and the interest the bank pays on its liabilities such as customer savings accounts. Use of the method had resulted in a roughly $1 billion downward adjustment to Bank of America's income in the second quarter. The bank said in late September it was changing the accounting practice, effective in the third quarter of this year. In early October, the bank announced its head of global wealth and retirement solutions, Andy Sieg, will become head of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management at the end of the year when John Thiel steps down. Thiel will become vice chairman of global wealth and investment management beginning Jan. 1, 2017. Over the last three months, financials themselves are the second-best performers in the S&P 500. But the sector has struggled the whole year with moderate economic growth, lowered expectations for a U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike and one of the worst starts to a year for the U.S. stock market. —Reuters contributed to this report.

Business The rise of the webcam job interview: 'It honestly was pretty horrible' Robo-interview Ira Heuvelman-Dobrolyub / Getty Images The robo-interview is becoming increasingly popular for employers -- but an unavoidable hindrance for job seekers. The robo-interview is becoming increasingly popular for employers -- but an unavoidable hindrance for job seekers. (Ira Heuvelman-Dobrolyub / Getty Images) Rebecca GreenfieldBloomberg The future of job interviews might horrify you. It horrified Jake Rosen. A recent graduate of UCLA, Rosen was applying to be a page at NBC (yes, yes, just like Kenneth) when he learned he wouldn't be going to an office to talk to a human being about his skills. Instead, he interviewed by webcam, on a laptop. So Skype, right? Nope, nothing as personal as that. He recorded his answers and sent them back to a hiring manager at NBC for review at the company's convenience. It's the robo-interview, and it goes something like this. In the more humane experience, a hiring manager, who also isn't all that practiced in the art of digital video, delivers taped questions. Or, if it's truly Mr. Roboto, a question pops up on the screen. You have a limited amount of time to answer. You talk to your computer, record the responses, and send them back to the company. Sometimes there's a practice question to get prospective employees used to talking to a camera. Sometimes there isn't. Often, at the end, you have the chance to re-record your answers. For shy people, it may be a dream come true. No firm handshake needed, and sure, you smell fine. And wouldn't we all love the redo option after making up an answer and mumbling it, too? For everyone else, it's awkward at best. It's a pretty slick encounter, a little like FaceTime, except you're forced to stare at your big, nervous face as you wax on about why you want to work at the company. It feels more like performing for an invisible audience than having a conversation, because that's essentially what it is. Not used to being on camera, Rosen felt flustered from the first question, which colored the rest of his interview, he said. "I'm not a YouTube star, obviously," he said. "It's such a weird experience talking to a camera. It honestly was pretty horrible." Jamie Black, who suffered through the video interview experience for a job at a school, said it felt "more like a game show than an interview." For many of us, the experience will soon be unavoidable. The human-free video job interview is on the rise. HireVue, one of a handful of companies making video interview software, works with 600 large organizations, including Deloitte, JPMorgan Chase, Under Armour, and most of the major U.S. airlines. This year, the company will do 2.5 million interviews, up from 13,000 five years ago. Nearly 90 percent of those are "on demand" interviews, with nobody live at the other end. For a hiring manager, the draw of the video interview is mainly efficiency. "Companies want to get to know way more people," said Mark Newman, the founder of HireVue. A recruiter can only get through so many 30-minute conversations in a day. And that doesn't take into account time lost to scheduling or on bad candidates. With a video interview, human resources staff members only have to review the answers, and can do so on their own schedule, without having to travel for on-campus recruiting. Using HireVue, Hilton got its hiring cycle down to 4.5 days, almost 20 days shorter than the average interview process. All of this saves companies money. Cigna has cut travel expenses for recruiters from $1 million a year, in some cases, to under $100,000. For the job candidate, the benefit of robo-recruiting is convenience-and that's about it. Generally, a company will give an interviewee a day or two to complete the interview, which can happen anywhere. That might sound like another plus, but for Rosen it only added to his stress. "You start to think about things you wouldn't normally think about in interviews. I started thinking about my surroundings," Rosen said. "I had to find a blank wall to sit in front of. ... Should I put a bookshelf behind me? A plant?" Recruiters say they don't judge candidates on their performance, appearance, or locale. "Judging is an interesting word," said Heidi Soltis-Berner, the managing director for talent at Deloitte. "I would say the on-demand interview is truly for fact sharing." Other recruiters said they do evaluate people on their communication abilities and eye contact. Even if hiring managers are instructed not to make decisions on how well a potential new employee can perform in front of a camera (which is a bit hard to believe), the whole setup can be trying. "You just see yourself and a stopwatch ticking down," said Black, who said his answers often got cut off by the timer. If and when he has to do it again, Black said, he would practice in front of a mirror with a stopwatch before the interview. Rosen said it might help to have someone sit behind the computer, as the interview happens, so it's like talking to a person instead of a screen. Just look at the camera so your focus isn't off. The best advice might be to just relax. "It's OK to come across as uncomfortable in front of the camera, because everyone is," said Scott Mitchell, a recruiter for American Wedding Group, which uses video interviews to prescreen the 1,900 independent contractors it works with. "We all assume you're going to be uncomfortable. We're putting you in an uncomfortable position." The robo-interview hasn't replaced human interaction completely. Many companies use it as a replacement for first-round screening interviews, followed by more traditional one-on-ones. But for interviewees who would rather go back to the old way ... that's not happening. Organizations can look at more people, and a more diverse set of people, with the video interviews, and save money on top of that. "Candidates will generally say, 'I would have preferred an in-person interview to this,' but that's not the right comparison," HireVue's Newman said. "The alternative is no interview at all."

After working off card balances he built up during college, Low started collecting new cards in May specifically to reap the increasingly lucrative travel awards banks are offering to encourage spending on their cards. In August, Low snagged a new Sapphire Reserve card, from JPMorgan Chase & Co, which has become a magnet for millennials willing to pay the $450 annual fee for a sign-up bonus worth as much as $1,500 in travel, plus $300 in annual spending credits and more freebies. Now Low is planning a trip to Germany with his girlfriend on JPMorgan's dime. "I have never been to Europe, so that is something pretty cool about this hobby," he said. The Reserve card opens up a new front in the war among banks to build up their lucrative credit card businesses. While it may be fun for customers, investors and analysts worry that battle will eat away the fat profit margins that made the sector so attractive to banks in the first place. "You have five or six big national players and they are going around killing one another," said Chris Kotowski, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. METAL CARDS RUN OUT Low illustrates the problem. JPMorgan won't know if he will become a profitable customer for another year because the up-front rewards are so great. He may drop the Reserve card before the next annual fee. He has already acquired two more cards and now is spending on those to meet their requirements for more sign-up bonuses. And he doesn't intend to borrow on his cards. That could be bad for JPMorgan because credit card companies historically have made about three-fourths of their revenue from interest. The rest has come from fees, which are being whittled away by the rising costs of the givebacks. Still, JPMorgan executives say they are thrilled that many more young people applied for the Reserve card than they ever expected. That's especially true with millennials - people who reached adulthood around 2000 - who are the next generation of depositors and borrowers. "It has been a huge success," said Kevin Watters, the bank's chief executive for cards. The bank so underestimated the demand that it quickly ran out of its initial stock of metal cards and had to resort to plastic for a while. To make money from the card, JPMorgan has to have the right mix of customer spending, annual renewals and borrowing with repayments, said John Grund, a partner at card industry consulting firm First Annapolis. Marianne Lake, JPMorgan's chief financial officer, declined to say how much card debt the bank needs customers to take on. "I am not going to give you the details of our business case, but I will tell you that we obviously have a lot of experience in a number of different (card) products," Lake told reporters on Friday after the bank posted results. Historically, airline travel award cards have been successful, with about 50 percent of customers borrowing, said Grund. High-fee cards used by the wealthy have worked with less borrowing, but with less valuable incentives than the Reserve card. CARD WAR Like JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc also has been spending hundreds of millions of dollars to encourage additional spending and borrowing on its cards. The other two banks among the four biggest in the United States, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co , have also been looking for more card business, but less aggressively. Citigroup intensified the card war last year by giving retailer Costco Wholesale Corp such a sweet deal for running its Costco card that it took the business from American Express Co, which said the winning terms were uneconomical. Citigroup said on Friday that its Costco deal drove spending on its cards to $73 billion in the latest quarter, 57 percent higher than a year earlier. JPMorgan said spending on its cards rose 10 percent to $139 billion. On Monday, Bank of America said spending on its credit cards was up 8 percent, adjusted for some divestitures late last year. The bank's chief executive, Brian Moynihan, told analysts that "one of the great debates we have in the company" is over giving up too much, or too little, in incentives on cards. The banks do not report clear and mutually comparable figures for actual profits from cards. But executives say cards are among the most profitable of any business, with returns on equity of as much as 25 percent, about twice banks' recent overall return. Citigroup's Costco deal fueled a round of concessions by banks to renew contracts with other retailers, hotel and airline companies for co-branded cards. JPMorgan's new deals with Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, online retailer Amazon.com and others, for example, will cut revenue by about $900 million annually, the bank said earlier this year. Now, with the Reserve card, JPMorgan has "fundamentally changed the calculus for what makes a premium credit card," said Sean McQuay, who tracks card offers at online personal finance website NerdWallet.com. Citigroup, he said, needs to respond with more givebacks on its Prestige premium card. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach disagrees. The Prestige card is already a "strong offering," he told reporters on Friday. JPMorgan, he said, has "a very attractive offer on the table right now. We will see whether or not that is sustainable." Earlier this month, American Express increased rewards on its Platinum card, the traditional leader among high-fee cards. American Express spokeswoman Charlotte Fuller said the move was not a competitive response, but a coincidental improvement for customers. PERSONAL REDEMPTION The intense competition over card rewards has its roots in the financial crisis of 2008. Post-crisis reforms reduced the profitability of other businesses such as mortgages and capital markets trading, encouraging banks to turn to cards for profits. And, within that business, the reforms pushed banks from people with lower credit ratings toward creditworthy customers who respond to incentives. And lately, the banks have had the means to bid more for customers because loan losses have declined to record lows. At the same time, cardholders have become more savvy about working the incentives. Ivan Drucker, a New York City-based consultant to Apple computer users, recently used awards from a strategically managed mix of credit cards to travel in luxury to Finland. Drucker, 46, said he borrowed on cards at high rates in years past, but he's determined not to do it again. "For me, there's personal redemption in this," Drucker said. "They got the better of me. Now I hope to turn those tables."

 Chase's rivals could narrow the mobile banking gap BI Intelligence Oct. 17, 2016, 11:11 AM 1,254 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Alipay broke records during Singles' Day Chase has debuted a new card aimed at small businesses Samsung Rewards could spur Samsung Pay adoption This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, two of the largest US banks, said their active digital banking users continued to grow during Q3 2016 earnings calls held Friday. JPMorgan Chase now counts 26 million active mobile banking customers, the most of the major banks in the US. That’s up from 24.8 million users in the previous quarter, and marks 18% year-over-year (YoY) growth. Despite hiccups related to its fraudulent-accounts scandal, Wells Fargo counts 27.4 million overall active digital customers, 18.8 million of which are active on mobile. The firm added just under a million users to the 18 million it had in Q2 2016. The mobile banking playing field seems to be leveling out.    Banks are catching up to Chase. Chase still has significantly more mobile banking users than its competitors. But other banks are growing at a similar rate — Wells Fargo recorded 17.3% growth YoY in Q3 2016, which means that it could be outpaced moving forward. And growth from competitors could accelerate in light of a renewed focus on mobile banking. Chase has long focused on engaging digital and mobile consumers. That’s key, because these customers tend to have lower attrition rates and consume more banking products overall. But in a management reshuffle, Wells Fargo recently created a new digital payments division that will house mobile banking, among other services. That division could help the bank renew its focus on the needs of its digital-savvy customers and lead to the introduction of products and services that grow or further engage this base. Gaining in that space, or converting some of its online-only users to online and mobile, could help Wells Fargo become more of a leader in mobile banking.   Thanks to companies such as Chase, mobile payments are becoming more popular, but they still face some high barriers, such as consumers' continued loyalty to traditional payment methods and fragmented acceptance among merchants. But as loyalty programs are integrated and more consumers rely on their mobile wallets for other features like in-app payments, adoption and usage will surge over the next few years. Evan Bakker, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile payments that forecasts the growth of in-store mobile payments in the U.S., analyzes the performance of major mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay, and addresses the barriers holding mobile payments back as well as the benefits that will propel adoption. Here are some key takeaways from the report: In our latest US in-store mobile payments forecast, we find that volume will reach $75 billion this year. We expect volume to pick up significantly by 2020, reaching $503 billion. This reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 80% between 2015 and 2020. Consumer interest is the primary barrier to mobile payments adoption. Surveys indicate that the issue is less the mobile wallet itself and more that people remain loyal to traditional payment methods and show little enthusiasm for picking up new habits. Integrated loyalty programs and other add-on features will be key to mobile wallets taking off. Consumers are showing interest in wallets with integrated loyalty programs. Other potential add-ons, like in-app, in-browser, and P2P payments, will also start fueling adoption. This strategy has been proved successful in China with platforms like WeChat and Alipay. In full, the report: Forecasts the growth of US in-store mobile payments volume and users through 2020. Measures mobile wallet user engagement by forecasting mobile payments' share of their annual retail spending. Reviews the performance of major mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. Addresses the key barriers that are preventing mobile in-store payments from taking off. Identifies the growth drivers that will ultimately carve a path for mainstream adoption.

Morgan and Citi won’t get paid by Sarah Butcher 17 October 2016 It’s been an excellent third quarter for fixed income traders. Time to start managing pay expectations down then. http://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/262573/citis-equities-business-drops-by-a-third-in-3q/ The squeeze isn't over yet If you’re a fixed income trader and you’ve seen the third quarter results from J.P. Morgan, the third quarter results from Citi and the third quarter results from Bank of America, you will be asking one question: “Will I get paid?” With good reason. Fixed income traders haven’t just had a good third quarter. They’ve had a truly great third quarter. At J.P. Morgan, Q3 fixed income trading revenues were the best they’ve been since the first quarter of 2013. Moreover, the comeback was broad-based: KBW analysts point out that J.P. Morgan’s macro trading revenues (rates and FX) were up 30% year-on-year, while its spread products (credit and securitization) revenues were up 40%. Fixed income traders are hot all over. Again. It’s not just JPM. Bank of America today provided succour to everyone trying to believe in a long-awaited fixed income trading resurgence. During today’s analyst call, BofA CFO Paul Donofrio said the bank’s exemplary performance in fixed income was more than mere cyclical vapours. It was down to the hard work the bank put in four years ago, said Donofrio: costs at the bank were cut in 2010/2011 and BofA is now reaping the benefits of both the re-positioned business and its strength in primary debt origination. Unfortunately, this doesn’t mean traders at BofA will be paid up on last year. Nor are traders at J.P. Morgan and Citi likely to be rewarded handsomely for their efforts in the three months to September. The exemplary third quarter simply means that banks now have a hard job of managing traders’ pay expectations down between now and January 2017. This is why. 1. The third quarter was great. The first quarter was not Yes, banks had a great third quarter in fixed income trading, but if you cast your mind back to February 2016, you will recall that things weren’t nearly so pretty. The first quarter was dire. Year-to-date, things are therefore good but not gorgeous. 2. The comparables are terrible Yes, fixed income traders are having a pretty good 2016 compared to their 2015, but this is only because 2015 was a bad, bad year. As the chart below shows, all the American banks to report so far had a terrible 2015 in fixed income. Deutsche Bank’s Jim Reid points out that banks might be beating consensus in fixed income trading, but this is just because the consensus was that they would do terribly after a long period of poor performance. Of course they’re now recovering – just don’t expect to get paid because of it. 3. The cost squeeze continues Then there’s the fact that pretty much every bank is in the process of wringing as much as it possibly can out of costs, especially compensation. “Most expenses were lower year over year…this was led by lower personnel expense,” said Donofrio on today’s call, echoing pretty much every other CFO everywhere. Witness the chart below (Citi excepted). 4. If there’s any spare money, it won’t go on traders’ pay Lastly, there’s been no let-up in all the other things that consume banks’ spare cash. While FICC revenues have stood still since 2013, FICC infrastructure costs have increased. There are technology investments to be made (Bank of America today became the latest bank to proclaim itself “a technology company”). There are risk and compliance processes to be tightened. There are also gaps to be filled. During today’s call Donofrio declared that BofA’s fixed income trading business did well by virtue of the bank’s entire, global, cross-product trading platform (thereby implying that BofA falls firmly into McKinsey’s ‘global universal bank’ category). Clients use BofA because it offers everything, everywhere, suggested Donofrio, meaning a) that the efforts of individual traders aren’t necessarily that important, and b) that Bank of America’s fixed income traders can’t expect to be paid to the detriment of its equities traders, who’ve done rather less well (equities revenues at BofA are down 12% year-on-year). The good news is that because it needs to be all things to all clients, BofA has been hiring in rates as it strengthens its macro business. The bad news is that those new hires are likely to have detracted from the pool for paying its existing traders. Your expectations have been managed. Our pleasure.

(Investor's Business Daily) Anthem Inc’s (NYSE: ANTM) individual enrollment in the Health Insurance Exchange [HIX] is set to expand substantially, “even as the risk-pool is significantly disrupted by plan exits and as rate increases drive adverse selection,” JPMorgan’s Gary P Taylor said in a report. He downgraded the rating on the company from Overweight to Neutral, while reducing the price target from $154 to $132. While expressing concern over Anthem’s earnings in 2017, analyst Taylor mentioned that continued yty HIX deterioration in Q3 had resulted in “incremental near-term caution (materially higher uninsured admissions in August/September also raise intra-year attrition concerns).” Expanding HIX Footprint A review of Anthem’s HIX offerings in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Kentucky and Nevada, which are among the company’s largest states, revealed “no 2017 exits in any of the 1,458 combinations of rate areas and metal-levels,” Taylor stated. These five states represent more than 50 percent of Anthem’s individual enrollment. The company had 923k HIX members out of total individual enrollment of 1.7 million as of Q2 of 2016. Most of Anthem’s largest states are impacted by announced exits. The company’s projections imply a 10 percent margin contraction in 2016. “We believe that -10% margin will not improve despite rate increases in 2017 due to adverse selection; creating a plausible $1.00-1.50 yty EPS headwind,” the analyst wrote.

Economic headwinds could batter big banks, and in case you didn't know, Bank of America stock is a bet on big banks By Dana Blankenhorn, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Oct 7, 2016, 10:06 am EST     Popular Posts: Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is a Post-Election Casualty Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Has a New Path to Bigger Profits Buffett Bails on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) Stock. Should You? Recent Posts: Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Can Save Itself With This Move Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Looks Even Better With Urban Strategy Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) Stock Light on Revenue, But Can Explain View All Posts Shares in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) have been on a tear lately. Since hitting their low for the year of $11.11 in February, Bank of America stock is up by one-third. Investors got another chance to buy it at $12.18 in June, but since then, BAC has been on a steady rise, and opened for trading on Oct. 7 at over $16. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr Our Serge Berger likes what he sees, and now has BAC stock on his buying radar. But buying right this second could be a trap. The price-to-earnings multiple on the stock is up to 14, higher than peers like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) or Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC). BofA reports earnings in 10 days, and analysts are hoping for 35 cents p[er share, on revenue of $20.76 billion. That sounds good, but would fall short of last quarter’s 37 cents per share, or the 36 cents per share achieved in the same quarter a year ago — when BAC shares were lower than they are now. Though Bank of America stock’s valuation looks a little better this morning — but only because of a disappointing jobs report that put a damper on interest-rate hike hopes. There also is a global economic storm coming, a financial hurricane that will batter global business, and hurt the bank’s results. Who says so? Bank of America says so. Merrill Lynch’s Warning We are reaching “peak everything.” Those were the words of Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch, which Bank of America has owned now for nearly a decade. Bullish trends that have boosted globalization and liquidity look set to reverse, Hartnett’s team wrote yesterday. Politicians are increasingly anti-immigrant and anti-trade. There is a backlash against inequality. The global investment map is being withdrawn. Bonds are out, commodities and equities are back in. That means the value of assets banks like Bank of America hold on their books is due to fall. It means things like oil and gold are going to look like better investments. Market sectors that have underperformed in the past year are due to outperform. Does any of that sound good for Bank of America stock holders? A Political Call It should be emphasized, in a political year, that this is something of a political call, and one that is backward-looking. The Brexit vote, and that government’s decision to pursue an exit from the European Union regardless of the economic consequences, has unnerved markets. The rise of ultra-nationalists across Europe, Asia and the U.S. has bankers battening down the hatches like Floridians before Hurricane Matthew. Political trends can reverse, in response to economic action, but for now other analysts are heeding Bank of America’s warning and downgrading its stock. Vetr has downgraded BAC stock, and Zacks just says “sell.” I am personally more sanguine about the economic outlook than most, because I’m more hopeful about the political outlook. Trends may already be reversing, at least if 538.com is to be believed. That doesn’t mean I’m going to jump on BAC shares this morning. When investors or analysts panic, I like to wait it out before going for bargains. But the price-to-book of Bank of America stock remains 0.7 — dirt-cheap by historical standards, and rising interest rates (eventually) do mean money will get a price. In a few months, BofA might look very interesting. Dana Blankenhorn is a financial journalist who dabbles in fiction, his latest being The Reluctant Detective Travels in Time.

(WMT) Stock. Should You? Recent Posts: Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock Can Save Itself With This Move Target Corporation (TGT) Stock Looks Even Better With Urban Strategy Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) Stock Light on Revenue, But Can Explain View All Posts The bailouts of 2008 and 2009 may have saved the big banks and auto companies, but their stocks remain dirt to many investors, eight years on. The conventional wisdom of investing is that you buy what is out of favor, then hold until it becomes favored again. Thus it was fashionable in 2009 and 2010 to pound the table for companies like Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), American International Group Inc (NYSE:AIG) and General Motors Company (NYSE:GM). If you bought these stocks, however, your performance has lagged that of the market, and they remain bargains, even in late 2016. You may have enjoyed the dividends, but the capital gains have, by and large, eluded you. Fact is the bailouts were wildly unpopular with investors, no matter how necessary they may have been for the general economy. Investors are still not ready to make nice with the recipients. Big Banks Are Dirt Cheap The big banks that did dirty deeds and took the bailout money remain dirt cheap. Citigroup and Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) still trade well below their book values. JPM trades at a slight premium to book value, which is the cost of its assets minus their accumulated depreciation. For instance, if you sold off all of Citigroup’s assets, accounting for the depreciation on them, you’d have one-third more than its current market cap of $141 billion. Citigroup is, eight years after the bailout, worth more dead than alive. Seen on a price-to-earnings basis, all the big banks remain cheap as chips. Citigroup sells for 10.5 times earnings. JPMorgan Chase sells for 11.5 times earnings. Right now you can get dividends from JPM that yield 2.84%, better than a 30-year government bond, and you get to keep the stock. Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) was an exception to this rule, although its P/E even at its high last year was still under 14. But guess which bank turned out to be staffed by dishonest people? WFC is now down to a P/E of 11 and a yield of 3.4%, meaning it’s right back in the mud with its brethren. Perhaps the best example of this phenomenon — of huge institutions failing to perform as stocks while they recover financially — is AIG. AIG received the biggest bailout of them all, estimated in 2014 at $182 billion. That’s three times more than the insurance giant is worth today, after selling assets to get its books in order, and after initiating dividends in 2013 that started at 10 cents per share and have since tripled to 32 cents. General Motors Demoted to Corporal You can see the same phenomenon in the auto stocks. You can’t buy them for capital gains, even now. Take GM … please. The company got $49.5 billion in loans, for a 61% equity stake. After selling its assets in 2014, the government’s cost came to $11.2 billion.  Some said at the time the government got out early, selling its stake in December 2013. But it turns out Barack Obama pulled a Warren Buffett on that one. Since then the stock is down 20%, despite steady quarterly dividends that now come to 38 cents/share. You can get a 4.77% yield, out of dividends, just by buying GM right now. But the P/E is – and this is not a misprint – 4.08. That’s right, GM earned $9.687 billion, it’s on pace to do that again, but the market cap of the stock is just over $50 billion. It’s not just GM. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), which did not take the bailout, has a P/E of 5.3 and a yield of 5.04%. All the automakers remain out of favor. Toyota Motors Corp. (ADR) (NYSE:TM) currently sells for a P/E of 8. Bargains Mean Yield The bottom line is that the sectors subject to the bailout remain bargains, and are likely to remain bargains. For investors it means they’re yield stocks, more like cigarette companies such as Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), which yields 4.3% but is up 43% in value over the last five years. The difference is that cars and loans are not designed to kill you. Dana Blankenhorn is a financial journalist who dabbles in fiction, his latest being The Reluctant Detective Travels in Time.

X Bank of America profit rises on bond trading and cost cuts Second largest US bank by assets reports first profit increase in three quarters Mon, Oct 17, 2016, 15:27 Like rivals JPMorgan and Citigroup, Bank of America enjoyed a boost from a resurgence in trading         Bank of America, the second largest US bank by assets, reported its first profit increase in three quarters on Monday, foiling expectations for another drop as bond trading surged and expenses fell. Like rivals JPMorgan and Citigroup, Bank of America enjoyed a boost from a resurgence in trading. That came as clients scrambled to reposition after Britain’s surprise June vote to leave the EU and changing expectations for monetary policy in the US, Europe and Japan. KBC Ireland plans dividend to parent after €1.4bn bailout State’s AIB share sale moves closer with advisory move Taggart brothers liable for €4m guarantee to Ulster Bank Chief executive Brian Moynihan’s cost-cutting campaign also paid off as expenses fell in each of its four major business segments. On a pre-tax basis, quarterly profit was at its highest in a decade. Net income attributable to shareholders rose 6.6 per cent to $4.45 billion in the third quarter ended September 30th from a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 41 cent, from 38 cent in the same period of 2015. Analysts on average had estimated a decline to 34 cent a share. Revenue grew 3 per cent to $21.64 billion, beating the $20.97 billion expected by analysts. Global markets Net profit in Bank of America’s trading-focused global markets arm jumped 34 per cent from a year earlier as revenue from dealing fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities surged 39 per cent. Equity trading revenue fell 17 per cent. Last week, JPMorgan reported a 48 per cent increase in bond trading and Citi posted a 35 per cent gain. Like Bank of American, JMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo beat third-quarter profit and revenue forecasts but their net earnings declined; JPMorgan Chase’s by 7.6 per cent, Citigroup’s by 10.5 per cent and Wells Fargo’s by 3.7 per cent. Shares of Bank of America rose 1.07 per cent in premarket trading. Its stock has fallen 4.9 per cent since the start of the year, compared to a 2.5 per cent decline in the KBW banking index . – Reuters ADVERTISEMENT       Topics: Brian Moynihan Bank of America Jmorgan Read More JPMorgan to pay $200m fine for hiring Chinese ‘princelings’ Bank of Ireland ‘deliberately keeping variable rates high’ Car finance firm raises €25m for lending Sweden’s Central Bank weighs up introduction of digital currency Rising number of UK-based banks consider Frankfurt move Standard Chartered weighs private-equity investments Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Energy & Resources Draghi warns against allowing Central Bank to cap mortgage rates Economy John FitzGerald: Long way to go in fight against climate change Health Two die after operations by surgeon under investigation International Rory Best: We need our best performance ever Sponsored Designing the F-Pace: the story of Jaguar's best-seller HR managers need a simplified approach to pensions World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Airbnb takes on tourism industry with move into excursions 17:10 Three UK hit by data breach but no risk to Irish customers 16:28 Abercrombie & Fitch shares slide as sales miss estimates 15:52 Draghi warns against allowing Central Bank to cap mortgage rates 15:50 Germany says Commission has no right to decide on its fiscal space 15:39 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in Business 1 Ireland’s biggest landlord: ‘I feel bad for the Irish people’ 2 Public sector pay rises?

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 17, 2016 9:01am   Comments Share: A heaping plate of earnings is on the way this coming week, accompanied by Fed speeches and a smattering of data. Investors looking for news aren’t likely to go hungry, and may actually suffer indigestion from an information overload. It’s the heart of earnings season, and the coming week brings a full menu. Some of the key reports to watch include Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) before the open Monday; International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) after the close Monday; Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) after the close Monday; Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) before the open Tuesday, and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) before the open Tuesday. Mind you, all those reports come in the first two days of the week. There’s more after that, but to list them all here would take too long. Needless to say, investors might want to stay on their toes, especially anyone following the financial sector. Earnings on Friday from three of the big banking behemoths topped expectations, putting a charge into stocks, but whether the strength will last remains to be seen. One thing we have learned so far this earnings season, though we’re still near the start, is that revenue is king. For instance, shares of JP Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) were rewarded for beating analysts’ expectations on revenue Friday even though the company’s profit slid compared to last year. So keep watching revenue numbers across sectors and get familiar with Wall Street’s consensus estimates. Two other takeaways from Friday’s bank earnings: Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC) is in a battle to restore its reputation, but it did beat analyst expectations on revenue. Does that mean all is forgiven? Well, the bank is by no means out of the woods, as profit slipped in Q3, and WFC executives dealt with numerous questions from analysts on its conference call Friday about the recent fictitious accounts scandal. The other takeaway is some fundamental strength from JPM and Citibank Inc (NYSE: C), with fixed-income trading improving at JPM and trading revenue surpassing expectations at C. Getting away from banks and earnings, there’s plenty of other stuff on investors’ plates next week, including a speech by Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer on Monday afternoon, two speeches by New York Fed President William Dudley on Tuesday, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Tuesday morning, and leading economic indicators Thursday morning. It’s going to take lots of concentration and focus for investors to digest all this news as the week goes by. As the Fed speakers opine, investors need to watch Fed funds futures at the CME Group to see what the market forecasts as far as possible rate increases. Late last week, chances of a December rate hike rose above 65%, but chances for a November hike were below 10%, as that meeting occurs right before the U.S. election. With chances for a rate hike at higher levels, bond yields have had a healthy rise lately. As of midday Friday, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields were at 1.76%. That may not seem high by historic standards, but it’s well above the levels we saw below 1.5% earlier this year. A technical resistance level in the 10-year yield is at about 1.903%. Speaking of the election, volatility can often spike in these last few weeks heading up to voting day, so that’s another thing to watch. As of Friday, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was at just over 16, well above recent lows near 12. One other thing investors might monitor is the oil market, which reached one-year highs last week even though U.S. crude inventories rose for the first time in six weeks. OPEC’s plans to cut supplies have boosted crude futures by about 25% from summer lows, and the question is whether futures can get a foothold above $50 a barrel. That level has been a technical barrier in the past. The stock market has typically responded positively to stronger oil prices over the last few months, so let’s see if that trend continues. Banks in Spotlight, But This Sector Won’t Fly Below Radar: Though bank earnings take center stage Monday with BAC, the airline sector also is in the middle of its key stretch of earnings reports, which took to the air late last week when Delta Air Lines, Inc. (NYSE: DAL) reported, and goes into full throttle this coming week with United Continental Holdings Inc (NYSE: UAL) on Monday after the close and American Airlines Group Inc (NASDAQ: AAL) before Thursday’s open. Airlines have benefited from strong tailwinds over the past several years, with low oil prices, growing global demand, and industry consolidation helping some of the big carriers achieve record profits over the past year. But revenues have been declining at several of the major carriers in the first half of 2016, and the sector has slightly underperformed the broader market. Also, according to Federal Reserve CPI data, airline fares are at their lowest point since 2010. Delta’s Q3 earnings didn’t show any sign of a turn-around, with revenue slipping 5.6% year over year and a 6.8% decline in passenger revenue per available seat mile, an important fundamental indicator when looking at airline results. Both United Continental and American reported falling revenue in Q2. Can they recover from their stalls in Q3? Keep your seatbelt fastened. Bundle Up; It’s Cold Out There! The U.S. might be headed for a cold winter, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said last week, and that, along with higher energy prices, could make it more expensive to heat homes. Does this have a stock market implication? First, the EIA’s predictions: The EIA said it expects this coming winter to be about 13% colder than last, which was rather warm, but about 3% warmer than the 10-year average. At the same time, the price of nonelectric fuels like natural gas and fuel oil could be slightly higher than last year, and more along the lines of prices between 2010 and 2014, which amounts to about $635 for the average home using natural gas, about 22% higher than last winter. Can chilly investors find a way to profit from this icy scenario? The first thing that comes to mind is the energy sector, which is already up more than 15% year to date, making it by far the best-performing sector of 2016. Keep in mind, though, that energy has been a laggard compared to the broader market over the last decade, through periods of both high and low fuel prices. A bet on energy sector gains in cold weather isn’t always necessarily a slam dunk. Presidential Election Hurting Confidence? The University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment took a dive, falling to 87.9 in early October from 91.2 in September, and its chief economist cited the coming U.S. election as a factor. Expectations had been for a slight rise. The early October loss was concentrated among households with incomes below $75,000, whose confidence fell to its lowest level since August 2014. Middle and upper income confidence was nearly unchanged. “It is likely that the uncertainty surrounding the presidential election had a negative impact, especially among lower income consumers, and without that added uncertainty, the confidence measures may not have weakened,” said Richard Curtin, chief economist at the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers, in a press release.   TD Ameritrade and all third parties mentioned are separate and unaffiliated companies, and are not responsible for each other’s policies or services.

Continue Reading Below Net income attributable to shareholders rose 6.6 percent to $4.45 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $4.18 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to 41 cents from 38 cents in the same period of 2015. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 34 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, although it was not immediately clear if the figures were directly comparable. Revenue from trading fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities jumped 32 percent from a year earlier, boosted by Brexit-inspired volatility and changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan. Non-interest expenses fell 3.3 percent to $13.48 billion. BofA, like its peers, has been slashing costs to help make up for weak income from lending after years of low interest rates. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said in July the bank would cut annual costs by another $5 billion by 2018, which would take the total to about $53 billion from about $58 billion in 2015. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT The Federal Reserve, which last raised interest rates by 0.25 percentage points in December, has kept rates unchanged since then but has indicated a possible hike in December. The three other big U.S. banks that have reported third-quarter results all beat profit and revenue forecasts. However, their net earnings declined - JPMorgan Chase's by 7.6 percent, Citigroup's by 10.5 percent and Wells Fargo's by 3.7 percent. BofA, whose shares were up 1.6 percent at $16.25 in premarket trading, said total revenue net of interest expenses rose 3 percent to $21.64 billion. Net interest income rose 3 percent to $10.20 billion, the first increase in three quarters. BofA said last month it would alter the way it accounts for changes in long-term interest rates from the third quarter as a way to reduce volatility in reported net interest income. Like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, BofA set aside more money to cover potential bad loans. The bank's provisions rose 5.5 percent $850 million in the quarter. Income from investment banking rose 13.3 percent to $1.46 billion, driven by higher debt and equity issuance activity. JPMorgan and Citigroup also benefited from a pickup in investment banking activity after a slow first-half of the year. Adjusted revenue from Bank of America's wealth and investment management unit, which includes Merrill Lynch, fell 1.7 percent to $4.38 billion. The wealth business has played a significant role in the bank's strategy to grow revenue from more stable businesses that require relatively little capital. Up to Friday's close, BofA's shares had fallen 4.9 percent this year, compared with a 2.5 percent decline in the KBW banking index.   (Reporting by Richa Naidu in Bengaluru; Editing by Ted Kerr) Fox Business Markets Politics Features FBN TV About Fox Business Channel Finder Advertise With Us Jobs Internships New Terms of Use (What's new) New Privacy Policy FAQ Media Relations Closed Captioning Policy Accessibility Statement Quotes delayed at least 15 minutes.

Photo: Bloomberg Singapore: Bill Winters just got a lucky break. No, the Standard Chartered CEO hasn’t found a magic wand to make regulators overlook the bank’s past misconduct. Nor has he discovered potions to ward off Brexit risks or boost returns in a low-rate environment. But it looks as if his sticky loans in India are finally starting to move again. As much as $5 billion of the $13 billion that the billionaire Ruia brothers are getting by selling Essar Oil, which controls India’s second-largest refinery, will go toward repaying lenders in the holding company Essar Global, director Prashant Ruia told Bloomberg News. Assuming StanChart’s share of that kitty at $2.5 billion, that’s half of Winters’s $5 billion India problem solved. This is easily one of the best things to have happened to the former JPMorgan banker in the two years he’s spent trying to fix the British lender, and the bank’s Indian depository receipts rose more than 6% in intraday trading, while shares of ICICI Bank gained as much as 7.5%. StanChart’s $1.3 billion provision on its Indian loans led to a loss for 2015, its first in 26 years. The all-cash deal with Rosneft and a consortium of Trafigura and United Capital Partners would also give the Ruias spare cash to invest in Essar Steel, which may help that company restructure its debt load. That would be an unexpected boon for Indian banks, hit by soured advances to the struggling steel industry. After several years of denial and delays, Indian tycoons are finally dealing decisively with debt. The announcement of the Ruia brothers’ deal, which the group is billing as “the largest deleveraging ever in India,” came soon after billionaire Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communications agreed to sell its mobile-phone tower unit to Brookfield Infrastructure Group for an upfront payment of $1.65 billion. Tycoons shedding assets is good news for StanChart, whose India franchise had come to depend too much on lumpy loans to holding companies backed by shares in operating businesses. Zarin Daruwala, whom Winters hired from rival ICICI Bank a little less than a year ago to repair the India business, will have a major win to her name once the Ruia check is in the bank.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 6:50 PM, October 17, 2016 Updated: 12:40 AM, October 18, 2016 NEW YORK - Morrie Low, a 27-year-old Seattle cocktail server, has found an unlikely new source of pleasure: credit card companies. After working off card balances he built up during college, Low started collecting new cards in May specifically to reap the increasingly lucrative travel awards banks are offering to encourage spending on their cards. In August, Low snagged a new Sapphire Reserve card, from JPMorgan Chase & Co, which has become a magnet for millennials willing to pay the $450 annual fee for a sign-up bonus worth as much as $1,500 in travel, plus $300 in annual spending credits and more freebies. Now Low is planning a trip to Germany with his girlfriend on JPMorgan’s dime. "I have never been to Europe, so that is something pretty cool about this hobby," he said. The Reserve card opens up a new front in the war among banks to build up their lucrative credit card businesses. While it may be fun for customers, investors and analysts worry that battle will eat away the fat profit margins that made the sector so attractive to banks in the first place. "You have five or six big national players and they are going around killing one another," said Chris Kotowski, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. METAL CARDS RUN OUT Low illustrates the problem. JPMorgan won't know if he will become a profitable customer for another year because the up-front rewards are so great. He may drop the Reserve card before the next annual fee. He has already acquired two more cards and now is spending on those to meet their requirements for more sign-up bonuses. And he doesn’t intend to borrow on his cards. That could be bad for JPMorgan because credit card companies historically have made about three-fourths of their revenue from interest. The rest has come from fees, which are being whittled away by the rising costs of the givebacks. Still, JPMorgan executives say they are thrilled that many more young people applied for the Reserve card than they ever expected. That's especially true with millennials - people who reached adulthood around 2000 - who are the next generation of depositors and borrowers. "It has been a huge success," said Kevin Watters, the bank's chief executive for cards. The bank so underestimated the demand that it quickly ran out of its initial stock of metal cards and had to resort to plastic for a while. To make money from the card, JPMorgan has to have the right mix of customer spending, annual renewals and borrowing with repayments, said John Grund, a partner at card industry consulting firm First Annapolis. Marianne Lake, JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, declined to say how much card debt the bank needs customers to take on. “I am not going to give you the details of our business case, but I will tell you that we obviously have a lot of experience in a number of different (card) products,” Lake told reporters on Friday after the bank posted results. Historically, airline travel award cards have been successful, with about 50 percent of customers borrowing, said Grund. High-fee cards used by the wealthy have worked with less borrowing, but with less valuable incentives than the Reserve card. CARD WAR Like JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc also has been spending hundreds of millions of dollars to encourage additional spending and borrowing on its cards. The other two banks among the four biggest in the United States, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co, have also been looking for more card business, but less aggressively. Citigroup intensified the card war last year by giving retailer Costco Wholesale Corp such a sweet deal for running its Costco card that it took the business from American Express Co, which said the winning terms were uneconomical. Citigroup said on Friday that its Costco deal drove spending on its cards to $73 billion in the latest quarter, 57 percent higher than a year earlier. JPMorgan said spending on its cards rose 10 percent to $139 billion. On Monday, Bank of America said spending on its credit cards was up 8 percent, adjusted for some divestitures late last year. The bank's chief executive, Brian Moynihan, told analysts that "one of the great debates we have in the company" is over giving up too much, or too little, in incentives on cards. The banks do not report clear and mutually comparable figures for actual profits from cards. But executives say cards are among the most profitable of any business, with returns on equity of as much as 25 percent, about twice banks' recent overall return. Citigroup's Costco deal fueled a round of concessions by banks to renew contracts with other retailers, hotel and airline companies for co-branded cards. JPMorgan’s new deals with Southwest Airlines, United Airlines, online retailer Amazon.com and others, for example, will cut revenue by about $900 million annually, the bank said earlier this year. Now, with the Reserve card, JPMorgan has “fundamentally changed the calculus for what makes a premium credit card,” said Sean McQuay, who tracks card offers at online personal finance website NerdWallet.com. Citigroup, he said, needs to respond with more givebacks on its Prestige premium card. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach disagrees. The Prestige card is already a “strong offering,” he told reporters on Friday. JPMorgan, he said, has “a very attractive offer on the table right now. We will see whether or not that is sustainable.” Earlier this month, American Express increased rewards on its Platinum card, the traditional leader among high-fee cards. American Express spokeswoman Charlotte Fuller said the move was not a competitive response, but a coincidental improvement for customers. PERSONAL REDEMPTION The intense competition over card rewards has its roots in the financial crisis of 2008. Post-crisis reforms reduced the profitability of other businesses such as mortgages and capital markets trading, encouraging banks to turn to cards for profits. And, within that business, the reforms pushed banks from people with lower credit ratings toward creditworthy customers who respond to incentives. And lately, the banks have had the means to bid more for customers because loan losses have declined to record lows. At the same time, cardholders have become more savvy about working the incentives. Ivan Drucker, a New York City-based consultant to Apple computer users, recently used awards from a strategically managed mix of credit cards to travel in luxury to Finland. Drucker, 46, said he borrowed on cards at high rates in years past, but he's determined not to do it again. "For me, there's personal redemption in this," Drucker said. "They got the better of me. Now I hope to turn those tables."
