By Ben Walsh , Alexander C. Kaufman , Daniel Marans Kevin Lamarque / Reuters 590 As soon as President Donald Trump announced last week that he would pull the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, a flurry of top executives issued statements criticizing the decision as bad for the planet, business and America’s international standing. But many of those same CEOs have supported ― through either corporate or personal giving ― Republican candidates who espouse climate-change denial. HuffPost asked 15 high-profile executives who publicly denounced the president’s decision if they would stop funding such Republicans deniers. All 15 either declined to commit, or did not respond to the question. HuffPost asked Tim Cook of Apple, Bob Iger of Disney, Darren Woods of Exxon Mobil, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Art Peck of Gap, Jeff Immelt of GE, Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, Meg Whitman of Hewlett Packard, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Sundar Pichai of Google, Mark Parker of Nike, Brad Smith of Microsoft, Indra Nooyi of Pepsi, Marc Benioff of Salesforce and Elon Musk of Tesla about the fundamental conflict between their statements and political giving. These executives and their companies have collectively given millions of dollars to support members of the only major political party in world that makes denying the scientific consensus on manmade global warming a platform issue. For some of the companies, the disparity between public stances on climate and political donations is particularly glaring. In March, Exxon Mobil urged the White House to stay in the Paris Agreement, two months after adding a climate scientist to its board of directors. But the oil giant for years has been the fourth-biggest corporate donor to Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), who so vehemently rejects the science behind global warming that he once brought a snowball to the Senate floor to prove a point. The firm ― which for decades funded a Big Tobacco-style disinformation campaign to undermine evidence that burning fossil fuels caused climate change ― continued to pay millions to groups that deny global warming as recently as last year.   Facebook’s political giving tells a different story than its founder and CEO’s denunciation of Trump’s decision. In the 2016 election cycle, Facebook’s political action committee contributed $146,500 to Republican U.S. House members, compared with $139,500 to Democratic members. In the Senate, where Democrats had a credible shot at retaking the chamber, the PAC gave $140,500 to Republican senators, compared with $90,500 for Democrats. A spokesman for Facebook referred HuffPost to a section of the company’s code of conduct stating that “Facebook PAC considers whether an individual candidate’s policy stances are consistent with Facebook’s public policy agenda and business interests, particularly the individual’s commitment to fostering innovation and an open Internet,” as well as the politician’s rank in his or her party or committee. Facebook gave to 37 Republican senators. Regardless of the views of these individual senators, Republican control of the Senate enables Trump to confirm climate change-skeptical appointees to key cabinet positions and block any major climate change policy action. Of JPMorgan Chase’s $1,337,951 in campaign contributions last year, $441,333 went to Republican candidates ― but the bank channeled over 67 percent of its donations to political action committees to right-leaning groups. The company cut off direct financing to new coal mines last year, but so far has not adopted new rules to curtail funding to coal-fired power plants and existing mines.  PepsiCo has been inching away from climate science deniers since 2012, when the food and beverage behemoth cut off funding to groups such as the American Legislative Exchange Council and the right-wing Heartland Institute. Yet nearly half of Pepsi’s political giving from its corporate PAC in 2016 went to foes of former President Barack Obama’s climate agenda, a Reuters analysis found last September. In some cases, the companies that have donated heavily to Democrats have gone out of their way to signal from the top that they support Republicans. For example, Apple employees donated just $181,369 of their total $1,265,383 in campaign contributions last year to Republicans, according to public data collated by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Apple’s CEO Tim Cook, meanwhile, personally hosted a fundraiser for Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. Disney CEO Bog Iger and Tesla CEO Elon Musk both withdrew from Trump’s business advisory council over their disagreement with the president’s decision on the Paris Agreement. JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon took a different tack and said he would continue to serve on the president’s advisory group. “I absolutely disagree with the Administration on this issue,” Dimon told CNBC last week. “But we have a responsibility to engage our elected officials to work constructively and advocate for policies that improve people’s lives and protect our environment.” Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost?

President Donald Trump wants to slash taxes, particularly the U.S. corporate levy that is the highest in the world. Jeff Cox | @JeffCoxCNBCcom Tuesday, 6 Jun 2017 | 2:04 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters CEO confidence flattens    Tuesday, 6 Jun 2017 | 10:20 AM ET | 01:25 JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon wants Congress to enact tax reform, and it sounds like he's not as patient about it as some of his fellow business leaders. The head of the nation's No. 1 bank by assets and chair of the Business Roundtable implored Washington lawmakers Tuesday to get to work on easing the nation's tax burden. "We have to do this," Dimon said during a teleconference with reporters. "It's been hurting our country for a long time. It's time to fix it."' President Donald Trump wants to slash taxes, particularly the U.S. corporate levy that is the highest in the world. However, his pro-growth proposals have gotten little traction from a Congress busy trying to enact a new national health-care plan and probing scandals inside the White House. Dimon spoke as the Roundtable released a survey showing that CEO confidence is at its highest level in three years. Much of that optimism, though, is predicated on getting an agenda through Congress that also includes lowered regulatory barriers and more spending on the nation's ailing infrastructure. Should signs arise that the economic plans, and particularly tax reform, aren't likely to be addressed soon, that could tamp down sentiment in a hurry. show chapters JPM's Dimon on regulation    Tuesday, 4 Apr 2017 | 3:03 PM ET | 02:39 "There is demand in the economy justifying investment. We're seeing it across a lot of industrial sectors," said Joshua Bolten, president and CEO of Business Roundtable. "What tax reform would do is ... substantially increase the possibility and probability for greater investment." Trump's critics believe the aggressive programs might add to a national debt that is approaching $20 trillion and a budget deficit projected to be $534 billion this fiscal year. "We'd like to see it be fiscally responsible. That doesn't necessarily mean complete budget neutrality, but it does mean substantially lower corporate tax rates and, importantly, a shift to a territorial system of taxation," Bolten said. "I think those two changes alone, even if done completely revenue neutral, would be a big boost to our CEOs' ability to invest and hire." Dimon said companies investing in countries with lower tax rates than the U.S. can and will reap the savings until the domestic tax situation is resolved. "Business decisions are made at the margin," he said. "At the margin we've been driving capital overseas."

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Stocks That Could Be Life-Changers Both financially and in a greater sense. Timothy Green, Keith Speights, and Jordan Wathen (TMFBargainBin) Jun 6, 2017 at 12:28PM A stock that provides a market-beating return over the long run can be financially life-changing. NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) all have that potential. NVIDIA and Biogen could also be life-changing in other ways, with new technologies and life-saving drugs. Here's what three of our Foolish contributors think about these stocks. A growth opportunity for the ages Tim Green (NVIDIA): NVIDIA is best known for its graphics cards, allowing PC gamers to enjoy incredible visual effects. But the company has long been aiming to use its GPUs in other applications. One area of focus is the automotive industry. NVIDIA's Drive PX platform, essentially a supercomputer for the car, uses machine learning to enable advanced driver assistance features and autonomous driving. Tesla Motors now includes NVIDIA's Drive PX platform in all of its vehicles, and NVIDIA has partnerships with other automakers and Tier 1 suppliers. Image source: NVIDIA. Autonomous driving will be a life-saving technology. Around 40,000 people were killed in motor vehicle accidents in the U.S. last year. Globally, roughly 1.25 million people are killed in motor vehicle accidents each year, with between 20 million and 50 million injuries. The human cost of motor vehicle accidents, not to mention the economic cost, is staggering. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to bring these numbers close to zero. For NVIDIA shareholders, the automotive business represents one of NVIDIA's great growth opportunities going forward. The business is booming, generating more than $500 million of revenue over the past year and growing at a 24% year-over-year rate during the first quarter. Automotive still represents a small portion of NVIDIA's total revenue, but it has the potential to grow much larger in the coming years. Changing millions of lives Keith Speights (Biogen): There's no doubt that Biogen has changed the lives of investors who bought a lot of the stock when it first went public and held on. The biotech's share price has soared over 13,680% since then. However, Biogen has changed and likely will change many more lives -- and not just financially. Many people across the world who have multiple sclerosis (MS) have had their lives changed by Biogen's drugs. Patients with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are just now beginning to experience the effects of Spinraza, a new product marketed by Biogen and originally developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals . It's the first drug ever approved in the U.S. to treat SMA, a genetic disease that results in progressive, debilitating muscle weakness. But perhaps the most significant impact Biogen could make is in one of the most tragic diseases of all: Alzheimer's disease. It's the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S. More than 5 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's disease. That figure could grow to 16 million by 2050. Biogen's aducanumab is one of the most promising experimental Alzheimer's treatments to emerge. The company reported very encouraging results last year from an early stage clinical study of the drug, with some evidence that aducanumab could improve cognition in patients with Alzheimer's disease by targeting amyloid plaques in the brain.  This early stage study provides hope that Biogen's late-stage study of aducanumab could be successful. If so, the world could actually have an effective Alzheimer's disease treatment by 2020. There have other experimental Alzheimer's drugs, though, for which people had high hopes only to see those hopes dashed. If Biogen succeeds, it will certainly benefit investors, but, more importantly, change the lives of millions of patients.  The big bank to buy and hold Jordan Wathen (JPMorgan): Shares of this bank should be locked away and held for the long haul. Of the largest banks in the United States, I hold JPMorgan in the highest regard as a risk manager and competitor. The bank is making inroads with consumer and corporate accounts alike. More than 60 million U.S. households have a relationship with JPMorgan in one way or another, from its highly rated credit cards to checking and savings accounts. Its credit card business has grown like a weed, attracting 10.4 million accounts in 2016, a 20% increase from the prior year. JPMorgan benefits twice on many credit card swipes, as it is as much of a card issuer as it is a payments network (the company licenses Visa's rails to process about $1 trillion of annual payments volume). Its commercial banking unit is finding similar success in attracting valuable small business clientele. The company had 2,220 middle market clients at the end of 2016, nearly three times as many as it had in 2010. The corporate and investment banking unit has a leading position, grabbing the No. 1 or No. 2 spots by revenue in mergers and acquisitions, equity, and debt capital markets. Few banks are investing as heavily as JP Morgan for the future. With $1 billion of spending in the last two years to open new branches, improve its digital offerings, and to build out its Chase Pay merchant processing business, JP Morgan is plenty happy to forgo profits today for larger profits tomorrow.  It isn't the kind of stock that will double overnight, but JP Morgan is one of the few banks that I believe has a better-than-average opportunity to compound its investors' wealth at a rate that exceeds the market average for a very long time to come. Jordan Wathen has no position in any stocks mentioned. Keith Speights owns shares of JPMorgan Chase. Timothy Green has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Biogen, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Nvidia, Tesla, and Visa. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Facebook Twitter Google + Email Print Here comes the Hensarling backlash By Ben White and Aubree Eliza Weaver 06/06/2017 08:00 AM EDT HERE COMES THE HENSARLING BACKLASH — Progressive groups are getting ready for a furious response to expected House passage on Thursday of House Financial Services Committee Chair Jeb Hensarling’s CHOICE Act. The Dodd-Frank rollback measure has little chance of passing the Senate in its current form but that’s not stopping financial reformers from taking aim at the measure. Allied Progress on Tuesday is launching a “hyper-targeted digital ad campaign encouraging federal employees from Trump administration departments and agencies to come forward and share any information they may have relating to documents and/or correspondence from Hensarling and the … House Financial Services Committee” Story Continued Below And Americans for Financial Reform this morning is posting a new blog item highlighting efforts to make the Dodd-Frank rollback bill an issue in the midterm elections: “In Kentucky, Indivisible Bluegrass, one of the many chapters of this new national network of progressive activists, is turning the CHOICE Act into a major talking point against Rep. Andy Barr.” Read more. And the National Council of La Raza this morning is releasing a poll they say shows that “80 percent of Latino voters believe that financial companies would be more likely to take advantage of consumers if there are fewer rules on banks, credit cards, payday loans and mortgage companies. That includes Latino Republicans, 73 percent of whom believe that fewer rules are bad news for consumers” MM SIDEBAR — This is just a little taste of what Democrats and financial reform groups have in store this week as the House votes on Hensarling’s bill. But with the CHOICE Act likely to stall in the Senate, the critical action will mostly take place at regulatory agencies, especially the Fed. This makes Treasury’s release of recommendations for easing regulations easily as important as the House vote. And it makes even more puzzling that Trump has yet to send up Randy Quarles as the nominee for Fed Vice Chair for Supervision, arguably the most important financial regulatory post he will ever fill. SPEAKING OF CRITICAL NOMINEES — Trump pulled the trigger on Tuesday on Joseph Notting’s nomination to be comptroller of the currency, per Victoria Guida: “Trump said today he will nominate … Otting, who once ran a bank founded by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, as comptroller of the currency, a key bank regulator. “The announcement marks the first move by the president to formally fill an important position at a U.S. bank regulatory agency, a big step in fulfilling his pledge to roll back parts of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act enacted after the financial crisis … Otting served as CEO of Mnuchin's former bank, OneWest, from 2010 to 2015. He was terminated after the firm was sold to CIT Group. “His nomination is likely to unleash a new round of protests from Senate Democrats, who fiercely opposed Mnuchin's nomination as Treasury secretary because of OneWest's foreclosure practices, most of which occurred under Otting's watch.” Read more. GROWTH VS REVENUE NEUTRALITY — From a briefing last night by Marc Short, Trump’s director of legislative affairs: “We believe the elimination of some deductions, the broadening of the tax base, the growth that will be spurred by the tax cuts, we want to make it revenue neutral. I think our greater priority is to provide growth … “I think that we want it to be revenue neutral. We believe that the economy needs to get spurred quickly. We want to make sure that there are sufficient tax cuts. … I think that that’s a conversation that I know that our partners in the House and Senate will want to be a part of.” M.M. TRANSLATION — White House officials are not super committed to revenue neutrality. They just want tax cuts and they want them soon. But they know House Speaker Paul Ryan is committed to neutrality and they don’t want to throw him under the bus at this point with negotiations toward a unified GOP approach still far from complete. THROW INFRASTRUCTURE ON THE PILE — POLITICO’s Andrew Restuccia and Lauren Gardner on the very murky path ahead for Trump’s infrastructure plans: “Health care and tax reform legislation are on ice, Congress faces a time crunch to prepare a budget and avoid a debt crisis this summer, and the White House is under pressure from the Russia investigations. “But … Trump is trying to turn D.C.’s focus this week to two other mammoth pitches — privatizing air traffic control and promoting his $1 trillion infrastructure plan. The problems: Capitol Hill aides say a broad infrastructure bill isn’t going anywhere any time soon either. And the proposed air-safety overhaul failed to even make it to the House floor when GOP lawmakers proposed it a year ago” Read more. WHITE HOUSE ADMITS: RUSSIA SLOWING US DOWN — POLITICO’s Matthew Nussbaum and John Bresnahan: “Top aides to … Trump are acknowledging that the ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election are overwhelming his legislative agenda as former FBI Director James Comey is set to appear at blockbuster Senate hearing later this week. “More than four months into Trump’s presidency — and despite total GOP control of Washington — Trump has achieved very little on Capitol Hill, in part because the Russia scandal leaves little room for anything else. Republicans now face the real prospect of going into the 2018 midterms with little to show voters, despite huge promises by Trump” Read more.

DIMON ON STICKING WITH TRUMP — Here’s JPM’s Dimon on Bloomberg TV on not quitting Trump’s CEO council after the Paris decision: “I am an American patriot and I want to help the President of the United States. When someone is piloting the airplane, you want to root for the pilot so I want to help him as best I can. “It is very hard if you say I'm going to go off of an advisory group or not do A,B,C because of one issue. Honestly, no one is going to agree with any president or prime minister everywhere on every issue. So I don't want to overreact to it.” SUMMERS NOT BUYING IT — Larry Summers, also on Bloomberg: “Where does this principle stop? Jamie says it's one issue. What would cause him to back off? Now look, our president is very different and I think the rhetoric on the left that compares him to leaders in Europe in the 1930s is frankly overdone. “That said, at what point as a patriot is your allegiance to your country, rather than to your president? I've always thought as my allegiance as a patriot as being to my country. That's why if I had been asked to support the kind of policies that are being advocated by this administration while in government, I surely would have resigned.” More here.

For example, if it had already been in effect, the CFPB would have been powerless to do anything about the millions of fraudulent accounts Wells Fargo opened.

A decade ago, the Blackstone co-founder, chairman, and chief executive officer was astride Wall Street as the private equity poster boy, armed with record-setting deals, a momentarily blockbuster initial public offering, and a birthday party that people are still talking about. The intervening 10 years brought turbulence to the financial industry, yet the associated regulatory and market reaction ultimately buoyed Blackstone’s, and Schwarzman’s, bottom line. Nonetheless, the company’s stock price has languished—a sore point for Schwarzman, even as Blackstone has outpaced all its competitors to become the unrivaled leader in alternative assets, the class of investments that includes private equity, hedge funds, credit, and real estate. Schwarzman himself has widened his focus to encompass large-scale philanthropy, and he counsels heads of state, most notably President Trump. Alongside the president in Saudi Arabia, Schwarzman—who chairs Trump’s Strategic and Policy Forum—announced a $100 billion infrastructure effort, with $20 billion of equity coming from the Saudis. During two wide-ranging conversations in his Park Avenue office in Manhattan, Schwarzman ruminated on presidential politics, Chinese dealmaking, that stubborn share price, and relaxing to Law & Order after working “two and a half full-time jobs.” JASON KELLY You’ve counseled the last three presidents. What have you taken away from that experience? STEVE SCHWARZMAN Well, it gives you new respect for how complex it is being president of the United States. It’s a really tough job: the differences in the political parties, the difficulties of passing legislation. And then there’s the variety of the job itself—from dealing with highly complex things to doing public events without much substance. And then there’s the fact that the world never stops, and we’re just in one time zone. Washington, D.C., puts enormous burdens on people who, at the end of the day, are just humans. They come with a title, with expectations, but they’re people—and it’s really hard, in a complex, international, instant-communication world that we live in now, to be the person at the center of the vortex. This interview appears in the June / July 2017 issue of Bloomberg Markets. Subscribe now. Photographer: Dylan Coulter for Bloomberg Markets JK How have your interactions with this president been different from those in the past? SS I think that the current president is quite practical in terms of being willing to change his positions and is quite practical in terms of what’s effective, what can work. He’s very driven on execution and has some very strong ideas on regulatory reforms and changes in tax. I would say he’s extremely pro-growth, which gets described as pro-business, but it’s really pro-growth, pro-job creation. Every president has some type of ideology, and the current president is basically a capitalist who believes in efficiency. I think that’s what his ideology is. So whenever he sees something that is inconsistent with efficiency, he’ll abandon what he said before in order to get to execution. The previous government was different. They had a very strong ideology, which wasn’t necessarily as simple as capitalism. What I’ve found in being around political people is they’re willing to negotiate their ideology somewhere around 5 percent. They believe that’s really stepping out. And it’s really hard to do business when you only move 5 percent from your ideology. So you have to take each of these people as who they are and work with them. JK Blackstone went public almost exactly 10 years ago. As you think back to 2007, is this where you expected to be personally and at Blackstone? [Peter Grauer, chairman of Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, is a nonexecutive director at Blackstone.] SS There are a lot of things that happened in 10 years. I didn’t think, 10 years after we went public, that the stock would be the same price. That’s without dividends; the dividend is around 6 percent a year. So in that sense, it’s a 6 percent appreciation. I thought it would be a good deal higher. On the other hand, I didn’t think the company would be as large and as profitable as it is now. In 2014, Blackstone was the most profitable money manager in the world. I did not anticipate that. We’re a specialty money manager. The idea that we’d be 4 times bigger, when almost everyone else is smaller as a result of the financial crisis, was a sign of enormous strength and execution, and it speaks to the power of alternatives as a concept. Overall, I’d give us quite a good grade. The only unhappy element of that would be our stock price. JK And why hasn’t the share price budged? SS That is a really interesting question. If I truly understood that, I’d fix it. But there’s a complete dichotomy between the people who give us $367 billion [Blackstone’s total assets under management], who are quite confident of what those results will be, and the public investors, who represent probably $17 billion, roughly half our market cap. So why would that $17 billion take a position completely different than the $367 billion? Which is like, if I have my math right in my head, 20 times bigger. How do you come to the right answer? “You had to be in the continual invention business to do well. I just took it for granted that we had to keep inventing new things all the time” JK How have you managed to diverge from your competitors so much over the last 10 years? SS We’ve had a different strategy all along. One part was to be in the advisory business; it required no capital and generated cash, which we could use to hire more people without diluting. Second, to get into the private equity business; it was a great business and still is. And the third was to find other fantastic investment opportunities from a risk-reward perspective. So that was our strategy from Day One. I was sort of in the last generation of people in finance who did everything. It was before specialization. If you were in corporate finance at that time, like I was, you were doing mergers, IPOs, debt deals, debt for equity swaps, restructuring—anything that needed to be done you did. And because you were seeing the entire field in play, you realized that nothing lasted forever. There are no patents in finance. Everything has a decay curve, in terms of its margins. You had to be in the continual invention business to do well. I just took it for granted that we had to keep inventing new things all the time. JK Why did that make Blackstone so resilient after the financial crisis? SS When we went into the crisis, we already had the platforms. As the opportunities presented themselves, all of our businesses were in great shape. We didn’t have to deal with the world of problems. We were good underwriters, and the opportunities were profound—they were almost everywhere. And so that enabled us to enter those different business lines further. We basically raised very, very large-scale capital from everyone we could. The more successful the outcome, the more they wanted to give us. And it became a virtuous circle of doing well for them, looking for new opportunities whenever we could, and them giving us very large amounts of capital. Our timing was right for all of these different opportunities. The system we designed, of being able to see across asset classes and controlling risk, informed us where we should be and not be, which enabled us to grow very large-scale businesses with a small number of people. I think for people who weren’t set up like that, it was much more difficult. Photographer: Dylan Coulter for Bloomberg Markets JK You’ve leaned much harder into real estate than anyone else. SS We jammed down the accelerator everywhere we could. The difference is that we were in real estate since the collapse in 1992; that’s when we entered the business. We’ve been very large purchasers since way back then. We were already doing the largest deals in the world in 2007. The deal for EOP [Equity Office Properties Trust], announced that February, was a $40 billion purchase. We sold $30 billion of the $40 billion within five weeks. So that’s $70 billion of real estate coming in and out of Blackstone. Before EOP, nobody in the real estate business had bought and sold more than $10 billion in a year. That one transaction was seven times what anyone had done. JK When I think about the private equity industry, it was started—if I may be so bold—by a group of swashbucklers: you, David Bonderman, Henry Kravis, David Rubenstein. How does this industry retain that swashbuckling nature? SS Well, reluctantly, we all grow up. And I don’t know about swashbuckling. I can only speak for our organization and not for others. I’m 70 and in great health with enormous enthusiasm. I love what I’m doing. But in 1987, when we closed our first fund, I was absolutely essential, because there was hardly anybody else here. At this point in my career, I’m not essential. We have enormous capability with the people here running each of our businesses, from a managerial sense. These are remarkably talented people, each of them running businesses worth somewhere around $100 billion. In fact, each of our businesses is the same size as the other firms—and growing quite rapidly with world-scale standards for results. JK One of the people you didn’t have to grow was Tony James, whom you brought in as president in 2002. That’s a noteworthy moment in Blackstone’s history, in part because we don’t see people come in at that senior of a level very often in the alternatives space. What led you to make that decision? SS That was a really easy decision. I was working 18-hour days, the business kept growing very rapidly, and the demands on me were astonishing. Beside the fact of living a life of perpetual overstimulation as we were growing, I could see that I couldn’t get to everything. The firm was too dependent on me as a choke point because I was very focused on controlling risk. When you lose control of risk at a financial institution, you do a variety of unfortunate credit extensions or purchases—and all of a sudden you’ve blown up your business. I was committed that that wouldn’t happen. JK Was that a lesson from your days at Lehman Brothers? SS It’s a lesson from Lehman. And also, when I started in finance, I asked someone, “Why do A-rated financial institutions trade at big premiums, in terms of their debt interest rates, compared to a similarly rated industrial company?” He said to me, “Steve, financial institutions go broke in a day. It takes years for an industrial company to lose its market position and finally give up the ghost.” So it became clear to me that doing mergers and private equity deals was unsustainable if I was going to grow the firm. So I decided we needed somebody else to help at a similar level. I was very close to bringing Jimmy Lee in from JPMorgan. They had worked with us a lot, and I really liked Jimmy. In fact, we had completed the contract and the press release, and he called me the day of the announcement to say he was just too loyal and couldn’t leave. JK He kept that contract in his desk drawer for years afterward. [Lee died in 2015.] SS Well, I knew all the people at JPMorgan, so I knew why he felt that way. When we’d first started discussing things, I’d told him, “Jimmy, you’re not going to be able to leave.” He said, “No, no! I want to try something new. You and I get along great.” I was on the veranda at a Ritz-Carlton in Florida when he called my cell phone. I couldn’t believe it. JK So then you realized you needed to do a search? SS Which we did—and I didn’t like anybody as a complete package. Rather than go forward with anybody who wasn’t perfect, we canceled the search. I doubled down and said, “No solution right now. I just need to keep doing things myself.” I did that for another year or two, but it just felt increasingly hopeless. So I did another search. A lot of the same names were on there; I figured they hadn’t changed. Of the new options, one was this guy named Tony James, who’d made his name at DLJ before they sold themselves to Credit Suisse. I called three people who’d known me from my few months at DLJ and had also worked with Tony, and it turned out he’d done similar things to what I had done. He’d started their private equity business, oversaw their M&A activity, ran their investment banking, and was the head credit extender. He was the person who pushed the button: “We’ll buy this at this price.” I started out doing that here. These were all things we had in common, so when I started interviewing Tony, it was like interviewing myself­—except that we have a different personality type, and he’s somebody who was smarter than I was, which I sort of liked. JK How difficult was it to persuade him? SS He really hated where he was. He’d loved DLJ; it had a wonderful spirit, kind and thoughtful management, great interpersonal chemistry. I liked it when I was there, even for what was, like, seven or eight months. It had a special feeling. Other people were trying to recruit him at that time—he wanted out from Credit Suisse—so that was probably the single best decision I’ve made. JK Has there been anything he persuaded you to do that you weren’t immediately in favor of? According to lore, he brought you the idea of acquiring GSO Capital Partners, which formed the cornerstone of your credit business. SS For sure. I didn’t even know GSO—because why would you? It was a little business with $5 or $6 billion in it. We tried to buy them several times, and each time they had something more wonderful. We had three shots on goal with nothing. They said, “We’re, like, really happy. Go away.” We sort of gave up, and what happened was, after we went public, our IPO was the second biggest in the world for that decade. This is a pretty noteworthy moment. And they called afterwards and asked, “Would you buy us?” I actually couldn’t believe it. JK What did you do? SS Bennett [Goodman, the CEO] came in, and I said, “Why do you want us to buy you? You’re like a pretty girl we’ve been asking out all these years. What’s happened to you?” And he said, “We’ve read your prospectus, and what you all have done is so impressive that if we can combine with you, our ability to grow will be accelerated so much just by virtue of all the relationships you’ve cultivated around the world and how you handle your business. We would rather be with you than on our own, and we’d love to be acquired.” Who knew? “I don’t get emotional about business decisions” JK One of the things that the growth of real estate—and other businesses you developed like GSO—gave you was a deep bench. SS It was beyond a bench. At that point, we had four ­platforms—private equity, real estate, credit, and hedge fund, with great people—that were among the largest in the world in the alternatives space. So we were talent-long and were perfectly positioned. And we didn’t get into trouble, which is very important in finance. Because if you get in trouble in finance, you have only so many people working at your firm. If they’re all working on messes, they can’t be doing investments; there isn’t enough bandwidth. So part of what benefited us was that we’re risk-averse. I have a saying: There are no brave old people in finance. Because if you’re brave, you mostly get destroyed in your 30s and 40s. If you make it to your 50s and 60s and you’re still prospering, you have a very good sense of how to avoid problems and when to be conservative or aggressive with your investments. JK One thing you voluntarily shifted out of in 2015 was the advisory business, which, as you mentioned earlier, was a foundational element of Blackstone. How difficult was that decision? SS I don’t get emotional about business decisions, but I was emotional about that. It’s where we started the firm. I always enjoyed the business because I viewed it not just as a profit center but as a flag carrier for the firm—and, in effect, free advertising. JK It’s also where you started your career as an M&A banker, right? SS It’s where I came from, yes, and we were planting the flag all over the world for the firm, in addition to our investing businesses. I was personally the last person to agree that spinoff was the right thing to do. It was very painful for me and carried a real sense of loss, but even I realized that the people in our advisory businesses would do better being separate. It was the right thing for them. And I just looked at the stock the other day. When we spun out our advisory businesses and it combined with Paul Taubman, who now runs the business, to become PJT Partners, the stock went as low as $20. Now it’s almost twice that, which was the same value we thought it should be back when we did the spinoff. Cover artwork: Zachary Walsh JK Speaking of IPOs, let’s revisit yours for a moment. One of the most notable aspects—then as well as now—was the sale to the Chinese. And that has tied the firm, and tied you personally, to China in a very meaningful way. How did that come about? SS Credit to China, not to us. In the spring of 2007, I got a call from Antony Leung. I was at home watching Law & Order and doing some office work. Antony was very well-known in China, having helped them restructure their banking system when it got into trouble. He’d been the head of Greater China for Citibank and JPMorgan and then financial secretary of Hong Kong before we hired him to be our chairman in Greater China. So the phone rang, and Antony said, “Steve, I was in Beijing for a meeting with ICBC”—which is China’s biggest bank—“and the chairman said there were two Chinese people who wanted to see me. So I saw them, and they offered to invest $3 billion in our $4 billion IPO.” At this point I asked, “What did you say?” and turned down the volume on Law & Order. “Who are these people, and where do they work?” He said, “Well, they don’t have jobs.” I said, “That’s interesting. I assume they’re very rich if they can write a check this big.” He said, “No, they’re not rich at all.” “So,” I said, “they’re unemployed nonrich people who want to give us $3 billion?” He said, “Yes, that’s right.” I asked, “Is there some reason you called me with this?” And he said, “Because they want to invest $3 billion.” I said, “Not to be forward, but where are they going to get $3 billion, and what did these people used to do?” “One of them,” he said, “was the deputy finance minister of China, and the other was the deputy head of the Central Bank.” “Aha,” I said. “So where are they getting the money?” “It’s coming from China,” he said. “Where in China?” I asked. “China,” he said. “The government of China wants to buy $3 billion of our IPO.” “No reason to go public if they want $3 billion out of $4 billion,” I told him. “Let me think about this overnight, and I’ll call you back.” I came into work, and I said, “Tony, I had the craziest phone call last night from Antony. He’s got $3 billion from two unemployed guys who he says are the government of China. What do you want to do?” And Tony said, “Why don’t we take the money and make the IPO $7 billion? We can put another billion in the company, and we can give another billion to our retiring partner, and we can take a billion dollars and let the partners themselves have it as a secondary offer.” So I said, “We don’t even know who these people are. We need to have them vote with us because I don’t want to have the appearance that we have a large shareholder.” And, “I don’t think we should have anyone on our board of directors from a foreign government. We have to know who we’re dealing with.” Tony said, “OK, that sounds good.” So I called Antony back, and the way things work is it’s 12 hours ahead there, so I’m at home watching Law & Order reruns again. Antony was ready to talk, because he’d done his stuff in China. So he called me that night and said, “I’ve talked to the Chinese, and they don’t want to vote with us on issues. They said it’s too cumbersome. Why don’t they not vote at all and take nonvoting stock? Not being on the board of directors is fine with them.” That sounds pretty good, I figured. So I said, “One other thing: I’d like them not to sell it for five years, then they can sell it at one-third, one-third, one-third.” Antony said, “I think that’s a bad idea.” “Why?” I asked. “I think that’s an awfully long time in China,” he said. “Go ahead and do it,” I said. So he called me the next night and said, “They’re willing to do three years, selling one-third, one-third, one-third.” So I said, “Sounds like they really want to do this deal. Just go back at five years.” And he said, “That’s unwise.” “Why is it unwise?” I asked. He said, “Well, if they do it, they won’t like you because you’ve taken away their face. The right answer is four years—in the middle—and then do one-third, one-third, one-third.” And I said, “But I know I can get five.” And he said, “Yes, but that’s not the point. The point is to have a long-term relationship with people who have mutual respect. So you should do four.” I said, “OK, I’ll do four.” The next evening he called and said, “Fine. Done.” JK So this is all over a very short period of time? SS Yes, a few days. I asked, “Well, what’s next?” He said, “There has to be a vote of the State Council.” As the “informed” China expert I asked, “What’s the State Council? Is it like our cabinet? If so, it never meets and does nothing, and we’ve got an IPO to do in another month.” He said, “No, the State Council meets every week. We can get a decision pretty quickly.” So I said, “How do you know that?” And he said, “One of the two people who approached me is spending spare time as the secretary of the State Council.” So three days later he called and said, “State Council approved.” “Are we done?” I asked. He said, “No, not done.” I said, “How can we not be done?” He said, “We’re not done, because there’s no provision to take $3 billion from the Chinese treasury. China has never made a stock investment in a foreign company since World War II, so there’s no law that allows the money to be taken.” I asked, “How does that get solved?” He said, “The premier himself must approve to take the money.” I said, “How long does that take?” He said, “One or two days.” I asked, “How is that?” He said, “The temporary secretary for the premier will put it at the top of the pile.” A day later, the thing’s approved. I think it took a total of eight days, including weekends. JK And, obviously, China has become even more important since, not just to Blackstone but also to you personally. And you’ve become something of, maybe not an expert, but certainly someone who is now more “informed” than then. What’s the most important thing you’ve taken from that? SS Well, as a result of that investment, they’ve included me on the board of Tsinghua University’s school of economics and businesses, which was started as a feeder into the senior levels of the Chinese government. That extends from President Xi, to the previous president of China, President Hu, to the head of the central bank, the person who used to be finance minister. It’s very much like Harvard in the 1960s with [President] Kennedy. And so I got to meet all these people at board meetings and so forth. It was a very easy introduction to China, and Chinese institutions have given us a lot of money to invest in private equity and alternative products. And I personally know a lot about China now, because I’ve had the exposure, and I have exposure in the States at a pretty high level. I see the common elements of things; I can see the strains. I find that Chinese are really easy to deal with. They’re pretty straightforward with me. I enjoy it. They have a great sense of humor, which is unexpected but fun. They’re also the second-biggest economy in the world and are growing at three times the rate of the United States. Their culture is ancient—5,700 years old—and they’re clever, inventive, hard-driving. They want to win. Sure, they’ve got a complicated bureaucracy, but I find China endlessly fascinating. It’s sort of like a year in China is like a dog year. JK How much do you worry about the world as it stands now, especially as we seem to be veering toward greater protectionism? SS There’s going to have to be some changes to the relationship between China and the United States. That’s something President Trump’s been quite vocal about. And I think the Chinese understand that there’s going to be some adjustments. That will all happen in due course. It will be either easy to accomplish or very hard. Nobody knows. JK Do you feel as if that’s one of the key roles you can play in this administration? SS Both countries are very central to each other. So if I can play a productive role and President Xi asked me to help—it’s not like I have nothing else to do—but if it’s important to the two countries, I can help. If nobody needs me, that’s fine, too. We’ll see what happens. JK It does seem as if we’re kind of at an inflection point for the alternative asset business. What are the most important regulatory issues for you as you think about the next year or two or five years? SS As you look at the things that can be modified, really it’s low-hanging fruit everywhere. I’m quite optimistic that well-­intentioned people who want their company to grow faster, to provide more jobs for regular Americans, can do that. I believe this is totally achievable. Because I’m studying this stuff as part of the President’s Forum. I’m just impressed. It’s, like, every place. We can do that without endangering things that need to be protected. “We were rejected 16 times out of 17. People were looking at me, saying, ‘You are really a loser’” JK You seem to be a pretty busy person. Presumably you’ve got to be able to chill at some point? SS It’s hard to relax when you have iPads and iPhones and you’re involved in a global enterprise where there’s something happening every hour of every day. I have a lot of involvement with the Schwarzman Scholars; Yale University, my alma mater; the New York Public Library; and all kinds of other things that I touch. And now I have this political dimension to my life, so that’s somewhere around two and a half full-time jobs. I do like to stop. JK I can’t help but ask: You mentioned watching Law & Order earlier. Do you still watch the show? SS Still do. JK Is that your go-to on television? SS It appears to be in syndication on almost every channel continuously, but leaving that aside, I, like all of us, have some things that occupy me in a different way. I like being in warm weather. I find that relaxes me. I like being near water. I like sitting on a beach and sort of hearing the water, watching waves break, looking at the shimmering. I find that really relaxing. I’ll do office work in that kind of setting, or I’ll read a book or a news­paper or talk on the phone to someone. I really like that. In business school, you have to figure out how to function in a world where you can’t even read all of this stuff, let alone make judgments. So that’s sort of continued. Now it’s—because of the magnitude of some of this stuff I’m involved in—if I don’t do a good job, or a responsible job, or understand something in a nuanced way, it’s a very bad place to be. JK Doesn’t that weigh on you? SS Not at all. I look at everything sort of like it’s an endless series of fascinating short stories, and I love each one of those short stories. They’re all fascinating, otherwise I wouldn’t spend my time with them. It’s endlessly engaging and entertaining and fascinating, and I love my life. I don’t find any of this a burden, because if it were, I wouldn’t do it. Every once in a while, I get something that isn’t so much fun, but it has to be dealt with. I definitely don’t feel any of this as a burden. The Passive War BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street control more than 80 percent of the ETF landscape. For the other players, the fight for survival is about to get more aggressive JK We’ve talked a lot about these past 10 years. I would submit that, if you think back to where we were in 2007, you’ve changed. You seem maybe a little more … mellow? SS I’m certainly less anxious. And I’m less anxious because we have marvelous people at the firm. Our businesses are doing well. I don’t have to worry now about some of the things that I used to worry about: Is every number, every assessment of a deal right? Are we hiring quality people? Are we training them appropriately? We now have A to A-plus players in every position. If you weren’t a little more mellow as a result of having all of these remarkable people and great processes at a global brand where people really want to do business with us—I mean, when we started, we were rejected 16 times out of 17. People were looking at me, saying, “You are really a loser.” Maybe I’m more mellow, but there are times—and people around here can attest to it—when I am decidedly unmellow. But I think what you’re sensing is that I’m happier. I look around at where we are as a business, and who I get to work with, and what I get to do, and I am extremely fortunate. And I’m having a lot of fun. And if I wasn’t, why would I be doing all this? Kelly is the New York bureau chief and executive editor of Bloomberg TV and the author of The New Tycoons.

Thanks to our robust business model, our dedicated and experienced teams and our global footprint, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver profitable growth in line with the Group’s vision: to be at the forefront of change in the mobility sector.” STRUCTURE OF THE GLOBAL OFFERING The Offered Shares are being offered as part of the Global Offering consisting of: an international offering (the „International Offering”) primarily to institutional investors, which will be composed of: a private placement in France; and an international private placement in certain other countries, including in the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A („Rule 144A”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the „Securities Act”), and outside of the United States in reliance on Regulation S („Regulation S”) under the Securities Act; and a public offering in France, by way of an open price offer (offre à prix ouvert) (the „French Public Offering”). At least 10% of the total number of shares offered in the Global Offering, prior exercise of the over-allotment option (the „Over-Allotment Option”), will be allocated to the French Public Offering provided there is sufficient demand. If demand in the French Public Offering is less than 10% of the Offered Shares in the Global Offering (excluding the exercise of the Over-Allotment Option), the remaining Firm Shares not allocated to the French Public Offering will be allocated under the International Offering. Purchase orders will be categorized by the number of shares requested:    • A1 orders: between 10 and 200 shares (included);    • A2 orders: more than 200 shares. The A1 orders will benefit from preferential treatment as compared to the A2 orders in the event that all A orders cannot be satisfied in their entirety. It is further specified that each order should be placed for a minimum number of 10 shares. SIZE OF THE GLOBAL OFFERING The Global Offering consists of 80,820,728 existing shares sold by the Selling Shareholder, which number may be increased to a maximum of 92,943,837 shares sold by Selling Shareholder in the event of the exercise in full of the Over-Allotment Option. The stabilizing manager, on behalf of the underwriters, has been granted an option to purchase additional existing shares sold by the Selling Shareholder that represent up to 15% of the Firm Shares, ie a maximum of 12,123,109 Offered Shares. Including overallotment option, the total size of the Global Offering is between approximately €1,320 million and €1,617 million. STABILIZATION J.P. Morgan Securities PLC (or any entity acting on its behalf), acting as stabilizing manager on behalf of the underwriters, may (but is under no obligation to) carry any and all stabilization operations deemed useful aiming to support ALD’s share price in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, in particular the provisions of EU Parliament and Council Regulation 596/2014 of 16 April 2014 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 of 8 March 2016. There is, however, no obligation for the stabilizing manager to undertake such transactions and such transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time and without warning. Stabilization transactions are intended to support the market price of the shares and may support a price higher than that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. In the event that the stabilizing manager undertakes stabilization transactions, such transactions may take place at any time during 30 calendar days following the determination of the Offering Price, or any time between 15 June 2017 and 14 July 2017, according to the indicative timetable. The stabilizing manager will ensure that the public and the competent market regulators are informed in accordance with Article 5.5 of the Regulation and Article 6 of the Delegated Regulation. Therefore, during the stabilization period, the persons designated as responsible ensure adequate public disclosure of the details of all stabilization transactions no later than the end of the seventh daily market session following the date of such transactions. The Joint Global Coordinators, Joint Lead Managers and Joint Bookrunners, on behalf of the underwriters, may decide to over-allot up to the number of shares covered by the Over-Allotment Option increased, as the case may be, by a number of shares representing 5% of the aggregate amount of the Offering, in accordance with Article 8 (b) of the Delegated Regulation. In compliance with Article 7.1 of the Delegated Regulation, stabilization transactions may not be effected at a price greater than the Offering Price. THE INDICATIVE OFFERING PRICE RANGE For information purposes, the indicative Offering Price range is set between €14.20 and €17.40 per share. This price range for the Offering is indicative only and the Offering Price may be set outside of this range. The indicative Offering Price range may be modified at any time up to and including the date of the determination of the Offering Price. In the event that the high end of the indicative Offering Price range is increased, or in the event that the Offering Price is set above the high end of the indicative Offering Price range, the closing date of the French Public Offering will be deferred or a new offering period will be opened, as applicable, so that there are at least two market days between the press release announcing such change and the revised closing date of the French Public Offering. Purchase orders placed in connection with the French Public Offering prior to the date of such press release will be maintained unless they are expressly revoked prior to or on the revised closing date of the French Public Offering. The Offering Price may be fixed below the indicative Offering Price range without restriction or the low end of the indicative Offering Price range may be lowered without restriction, provided that there is no material impact on the other terms and conditions of the Offering. INDICATIVE TIMETABLE FOR THE GLOBAL OFFERING The offering period for the French Public Offering will open on 5 June 2017 and is expected to close on 14 June 2017 at 5:00 PM (Paris time) for orders made at the branches of financial institutions and 8:00 PM (Paris time) for orders placed online. The offering period for the International Offering will open on 5 June 2017 and is expected to close on 15 June 2017 at 1:00 PM (Paris time), subject to early closing or extension. Orders made by retail investors via the Internet in the French Public Offering will be revocable, via the Internet, until the closing of the French Public Offering (on 14 June 2017 at 8:00 PM, Paris time). Individuals are responsible for liaising with their respective financial intermediaries in order to confirm whether the orders submitted by other means are revocable and if so under what conditions (including whether orders submitted via the Internet can be revoked by means other than via the Internet). Any order issued in the context of the International Offering can be revoked through the Joint Global Coordinators, and Joint Bookrunners listed below having received the relevant order until until 15 June 2017 at 1:00 PM (Paris time), unless the offering period is closed early or postponed. The Offering Price is expected to be determined on 15 June 2017. Trading of the shares is expected to start on 16 June 2017, on the regulated market of Euronext Paris under the ticker symbol „ALD AIW (as-if-and-when-delivered”) until the settlement date. The date of the settlement and delivery of the Offering is expected to occur on 19 June 2017, provided that the Offering Price is determined on 15 June 2017. Trading of the shares is expected to start on 20 June 2017 on the regulated market of Euronext Paris on a listing line called „ALD”. REASONS FOR THE OFFERING The listing of the shares on Euronext Paris is intended to enable ALD to gain visibility and reputation in the mobility ecosystem as well as to access to new means of financing and to increase its capacity to accelerate its development and to seize new growth opportunities in both the corporate and B2C markets. The Selling Shareholder will receive the net proceeds from the sale of the Firm Shares and, if the Over-Allotment Option is exercised, from the sale of the Offered Shares.

And even as polls have tightened in the week ahead of Thursday’s vote, a Labour majority would still stun financial markets. While Prime Minister Theresa May is leading a campaign that’s less business-friendly than past Tory candidates’, Jeremy Corbyn has pulled his party leftward, with promises to nationalize railways and raise wages and taxes. At the same time, unlike the Tories, Labour has vowed to retain the benefits of the EU single market -- a desire shared by most companies and investors. In the final days before the election, May and Corbyn have traded blows over each other’s records on countering terrorism, as recent attacks in London and Manchester turned the focus from Brexit to security. Polls have called for increasingly narrow margins for the Tories amid a series of political missteps by May, with the latest  one by Survation/GMB ended Saturday showing just a one-percentage point lead. Equity markets have a lot on the line: The FTSE 100 rallied to an intraday record high last week as perceived certainty over the vote’s outcome helped shift the focus to Europe’s economic recovery and solid earnings. “More dramatic swings might be expected in the event of an unlikely Labour victory, but Brexit would continue to cast a pall,” Alastair Gunn and Rhys Petheram, fund managers at Jupiter Asset Management, wrote in a note. Here are the sectors and stocks to look out for in case of a Labour upset: LOSERS  Domestic Companies In addition to higher political uncertainty, a Labour comeback is expected to push down sterling, making imports more expensive for domestic producers and squeezing consumption -- which is why U.K. mid-caps tend to underperform when the pound is weak. With Labour proposing to raise the minimum wage and strengthen workers’ bargaining power, companies with a large local staff -- transport players such as IAG SA , EasyJet Plc and Interserve Plc, as well as retailers such as Next Plc and J Sainsbury Plc -- will take a hit, JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by Mislav Matejka wrote in a note.  Nationalization Targets: Royal Mail, Railways  Corbyn has pledged to re-nationalize Royal Mail Plc, as well as rail companies when the franchises expire. This could spell trouble for FirstGroup Plc and National Express Group Plc, which offer transit services, according to JPMorgan. Financial Industry, Especially RBS  Unsurprisingly, the populist Corbyn is no fan of big banks. He’s vowed to separate investment and retail banking and extend the Stamp Duty Reserve Tax to a wider range of assets. One particular stock to watch is Royal Bank of Scotland Plc: the Labour Party said it will launch a consultation on breaking up the lender to create new local public banks. Defense  When asked about his position on Trident, Britain’s nuclear weapon system, Corbyn has equivocated -- though his party’s manifesto endorses renewal after his opposition was overruled in a party vote. Not renewing the system could potentially remove a large stream of business for BAE Systems Plc, said Sandy Morris, an analyst at Jefferies LLC. M&A  Both major parties are calling for greater scrutiny of takeovers, with Labour vowing to make sure critical companies have a clear plan to protect workers and pensioners in case of a merger. Thomas Seidl, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, warned it would be negative for U.K. equities, and would “strip out any remaining M&A premium on the stocks.”  Utilities Higher power bills are another target that have united May and Corbyn, but according to Citigroup Inc., the latter’s plan is even harsher for utilities. The Labour Party has proposed an immediate 1,000-pound ($1,293) cap on average household energy bills annually before transitioning to a fairer system, as well as creating public energy and water companies and regaining control of energy supply networks.  Pennon Group Plc, Severn Trent Plc, SSE Plc and Centrica Plc are among companies that may be hurt, JPMorgan said. U.K.-focused utilities have already slid after the Tories also pledged to cap energy costs, before recovering amid a lack of clarity. Companies including Centrica, SSE and National Grid will plunge at least 10 percent in the case of a Labour-led government, Deutsche Bank AG said in a Tuesday report. WINNERS  Exporters and Global Corporations While the stock market may take a hit amid the initial shock, the FTSE 100’s resilience after Brexit shows there’s a silver lining in currency weakness. A drop in sterling makes exports more competitive and boosts overseas earnings in pound terms. Click here for a guide to understanding U.K. election polls. Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day. Get our newsletter daily. Sign Up Of course, Brexit is still the dominant issue for the campaign -- and for most U.K. companies. With the Tories outright backing an exit from the single market in their manifesto, some analysts say a weakening of the party may help pave the way for a better deal with the EU. A smaller Tory majority or even a Labour-led government may actually be better for risk assets in the medium term, according to Morgan Stanley. “Better checks and balances against a hard Brexit could be possible” in case of a hung parliament, Ken Odeluga, a market analyst at brokerage City Index wrote in a note. “If Labour wins, a softer Brexit would still be likelier, and the market has made plain that it prefers soft to hard.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The troubled lender has been exploring ways to bolster its cash and short-term funds and held discussions about its options with the European Central Bank in recent days, according to a person familiar with the situation. A meeting in Frankfurt with the ECB planned for Tuesday was canceled after the talks, the person said. It’s not clear if additional liquidity was granted. The ECB is “perfectly informed” of the bank’s situation, a spokesman for Popular said by phone Tuesday, declining to comment on the specific discussions. Spanish newspaper Expansion earlier reported the meeting was canceled. Popular’s shares have plunged to the lowest in almost three decades and its bonds have tumbled, increasing pressure on Chairman Saracho to shore up the balance sheet, burdened by more than $40 billion of soured property loans. So far, Saracho has failed to find a buyer for the ailing firm. “Events are coming to a head at Popular,” said Roger Francis, an analyst at Mizuho International Plc in London. “There’s still a chance that the bank gets enough time to sell more assets or attracts a bid from another bank, but fear of the downside is escalating and a critical moment seems to be approaching.” In a sign of growing concern, the cost of insuring Banco Popular’s senior bonds against losses for three months jumped to 720 basis points on Monday, according to data from CMA. The contracts, which were quoted for the first time last week, were at 646 basis points on Tuesday. Short-dated swaps still cost more than longer-term contracts, another sign of stress. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. The shares dropped as much as 11 percent on Tuesday and closed 6.2 percent lower at 31.7 euro cents in Madrid, valuing the bank at 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion). What’s Next for Troubled Spanish Lender Popular: QuickTake Q&A Popular had considered seeking oversight from central bank officials to guide the board’s decisions should it fail to obtain the extra funds, the person familiar said earlier. Commercial banks can obtain loans from the ECB by pledging collateral such as their own debt, or other assets, like pools of mortgages. In exceptional situations, national central banks in the euro area can provide credit to solvent but cash-strapped financial institutions through what’s called emergency liquidity assistance. Popular set aside 5.7 billion euros last year to cover losses for items including loans, real estate and excess interest charged to mortgage clients. Its losses left the company with one of the lowest common equity tier 1 ratios among European banks, at 8.17 percent. That measure of financial strength slumped to 7.33 percent in the first quarter. Chairman Ousted The losses prompted the bank to oust Chairman Angel Ron -- who had led the company for more than a decade -- and turn to Saracho, who previously headed JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Europe, Middle East and Africa business. His mandate was to stabilize the lender and put an end to the losses. Under Ron, Popular declined to take state aid five years ago when a stress test uncovered a capital shortfall. Instead, it wound up tapping investors for funds three times, raising a total of 5.5 billion euros. The lender may need a further 3 billion euros to 4 billion euros to offset possible losses, Algebris Investments CEO Davide Serra said Monday. Spain turned to the European Union in 2012 for 41 billion euros to rescue its weakest lenders. At the time, banks’ mounting real-estate losses were undermining confidence in the country’s government bonds, aggravating the region’s sovereign-debt crisis. This time, the troubles are so far limited to Popular. Read more: Spain’s Zombie Bank Lurches Toward Uncertain Fate After Loss The most important market news of the day. Get our markets daily newsletter. Sign Up Popular has been offloading assets to bolster its financial position, raising at least 209 million euros in recent weeks by selling a remaining stake in Targobank -- a joint venture with France’s Credit Mutuel -- as well as a minority holding in real estate company Merlin Properties Socimi SA. The lender is also in talks to sell its U.S. unit TotalBank to Chile’s Banco de Credito e Inversiones, people with knowledge of the matter said in April. The unit could be valued at about $500 million, they said. In a letter to staff on Friday afternoon, Saracho said the bank has a number of alternatives, while telling Popular directors that it’s important to remain calm.

The economy grew a paltry 0.3% in the Q1, but that was more than many were fearing Wesfarmers shares plunge nearly 3% after it warns on falling margins at Coles Vocus shares shoot higher on hopes of bidding war after KKR lodges offer The Aussie dollar hits a one-month high on RBA confidence and weak greenback Sort posts by Newest Oldest 4:46pm on 7 Jun 2017 That's it for Markets Live for today. Thanks for reading and for your comments. See you all again tomorrow morning from 9. 4:40pm on 7 Jun 2017 Shares were buoyed by slightly better-than-expected economic growth numbers, but a slide in Wesfarmers kept the market slightly in the red, as sentiment remained fragile ahead of a number of global risk events this week. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index slipped by the slimmest of margin, 0.005 per cent, to 5667.2, its third close in the red this week.  Gross domestic product growth came in at a paltry 0.3 per cent in the first quarter and 1.7 per cent over the year. But that was still higher than many in the market were fearing following disappointing GDP components in the lead-up to the release, sparking some rises in both shares and the Australian dollar. Overall the data were nothing to crow about, with many economists concerned about sluggish consumption. "The first-quarter national accounts add to the string of data on the activity side showing that the economy is below trend and will not be reducing excess capacity soon," said JPMorgan economist Ben Jarman. "With the household sector subject to further headwinds from rising interest servicing costs, the pressure on the RBA's 3 per cent and above GDP forecast continues to mount." Globally, worries about the outcome of the UK elections, a potentially dovish stance by the European Central Bank at its policy meeting and former FBI director James Comey's Senate testimony kept investors on their toes. "Comey's testimony is likely to be the highlight," said AMP Capital Investors head of dynamic markets Nader Naeimi. "Looking at the market positioning, investors have turned too pessimistic on growth, so the Fed and ECB can lead to large bond-market volatility." Profiting from the caution were both bonds and gold, while the US dollar was sold off. Gold miners were among the day's winners on the local market, with Regis Resources rising 3.8 per cent and Newcrest Mining up 0.7 per cent. The big banks were slightly higher, taking a break from several days of selling, as were the big miners following some gains in commodity prices. The biggest drag on the benchmark index was Wesfarmers, which tumbled 2.9 per cent after the group at its strategy day flagged falling margins at Coles due to rising investments as well as losses at its UK hardware business. Vocus Group soared 21.7 per cent after a $2.2 billion offer by private equity group KKR sparked hopes of a bidding war for the underperforming telco. 4:17pm on 7 Jun 2017 Photo-sharing application company Pinterest has raised $US150 million ($200 million) from existing investors in its latest round of funding, which values the company at $US12.3 billion ($16.3 billion), a company spokeswoman said overnight. The latest funding round has slightly increased the company's valuation from $US11 billion when Pinterest raised $US367 million in March 2015. The additional capital will be used for further investments in visual technology and global expansion, the spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters. By raising money, Pinterest is choosing to delay a potential initial public offering as its business model matures. The company generates revenue by selling ads that look like posts on its site. Each month, 175 million people use Pinterest to collect and post images related to fashion, travel, cooking and other interests. The San Francisco-based company is targeting revenue of more than $US500 million this year, people familiar with the matter have said. Pinterest, once one of Silicon Valley's hottest start-ups, has been overshadowed by its faster-growing competitors. In the time since its last fundraising, Snap went public, Facebook-owned Instagram reached 700 million users, and Google built competitive image-based shopping technology. Pinterest has said its growth potential depends on improving its product to match people with images that reflect their interests and inspire them. The company said it will use the funds to improve its computer vision and visual search technologies like its Lens camera search, which lets users take pictures on their phone and search for similar items or images on Pinterest. The company will also use the new capital to improve its offering for international users. Shoe rack storage ideas: the kind of thing you might search for on Pinterest, a $16b company. Photo: Supplied 3:49pm on 7 Jun 2017 Shares in Murray Goulburn's MG Unit Trust have plunged to a record low today, following a downgrade by Bell Potter and amid worries over the outcome of a review of the company's capital structure. MG Unit Trust shares have dropped as much as 15.7 per cent to 62 cents to hit all-time low, and are currently down 9.5 per cent to 66.5 cents. That comes following a 14.5 per cent slide on Tuesday. Bell Potter downgraded the stock to 'hold' today with a price target of 73 cents. Weighing on the shares is news from earlier this week of a strategic review of the co-operative's capital structure, which many fear could favour farmers over shareholders of the unit trust. It is now clear in hindsight that the decision by the Murray Goulburn Co-operative to introduce a new capital structure and raise $500 million in 2015 was a mistake, the AFR's Tony Boyd wrote yesterday.  The reason given for the change from a pure not-for-profit  organisation to one that shared its profits with public investors in the MG Unit Trust was to provide a strong balance sheet, the funds to pursue growth and higher farmgate returns. But since the listing in 2015, shares in the MG Unit Trust  have fallen from $1 to a record low. The company has had to prop up its dairy farmer suppliers through a debt forgiveness package. 3:38pm on 7 Jun 2017 Go long the euro. Short the pound. Sell Brazil's real, the Mexican peso and South Africa's rand. Buy gold. These are some of the strategies managers are adopting as they brace for Thursday's trifecta of disruptions. AMP Capital Investors' Nader Naeimi sees former FBI director James Comey's testimony as the biggest wildcard. But he also thinks US bond yields are close to their bottom and the US dollar will gain versus emerging-market currencies. Comey's appearance before a Congressional panel about his investigation into Donald Trump campaign's ties to Russia will come just hours after the European Central Bank's meeting in the Estonian capital, Tallinn. Euro bulls are eager for clues on whether policy makers will consider unwinding bond purchases. The pound faces its latest Brexit moment on the same day, as the UK holds a general election. "The pound seems set for volatile trade as the results come in early Friday morning (Australian time)," said Westpac's Sean Callow who sees GBP/USD potentially anywhere from sub-1.20 to 1.35 in the most extreme scenarios. "Price action has made clear that the pound's strength – at least short term - is positively correlated with the outlook for the current Conservative government." There's more uncertainty brewing next week. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates June 14 and may offer guidance on both further increases and its thinking on when to start trimming its $US4.5 trillion balance sheet. "Comey's testimony is likely to be the highlight," said Naeimi. "Looking at the market positioning, investors have turned too pessimistic on growth, so the Fed and ECB can lead to large bond-market volatility." The pund is set for some volatility come Friday morning. Photo: AP Back to top 3:07pm on 7 Jun 2017 Gold is holding close to seven-month highs, but has shied away from the $US1300-level, for now. The precious metal is being supported by a weaker US dollar ahead of key political and economic events that are expected to stoke bullion's safe-haven appeal. A national election in the UK, a European Central Bank policy meeting and former FBI director James Comey's Senate testimony are all occurring on 'Super Thursday'. The events have the potential to boost the appeal of bullion, which is often used as an investment option during times of political and financial uncertainty.   combination of geopolitical concerns, including the UK elections and a wilting US dollar as Wall Street loses faith on US. President Donald Trump delivering on his campaign promises, have kept gold's bullish streak going, said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at OANDA. "With the degree of uncertainty around as we head into the latter half of the week, there would appear to be no reason for gold's march higher to peter out," Halley said. Spot gold is down 0.1 per cent at $US1291 per ounce, after rising as high as $US1295.97 overnight. "At $US1290, gold prices look too rich for our comfort. It has been rallying simply because of safe-haven demand," OCBC analyst Barnabas Gan said. "Once this driver that underpins the strong gold price disappears, beyond Thursday and till the end of June, expect gold to lose its lustre," he said. All eyes will be on former FBI director James Comey's testimony tomorrow in Washington. Photo: Bloomberg 2:46pm on 7 Jun 2017 Shares in blockchain software company DigitalX have soared 65 per cent, after it revealed that Melbourne-based Blockchain Global Limited - a Bitcoin mining, software and consultancy company - intends to take a 40 per cent stake in the company, subject to due diligence and shareholder approval. The $4.35 million investment has been partly made through Bitcoin - a world first, the company believes - with the first stage of funding being a $300,000 convertible Bitcoin loan. "The investor had a significant holding in digital currency, and could send the funds to us within 10 minutes," DigitalX CEO Leigh Travers told Fairfax Media. "It was just a faster way of sending through payment." The $4.35 million being offered for 40 per cent of the company is a 28.5 per cent premium to DigitalX's shares prior to the announcement, leading Travers to believe it will be approved by his shareholders.  The deal was partly concocted in New York, at a global Bitcoin conference last month. The conference included a commemorative dinner for Bitcoin Pizza day, which commemorates the purchase of two large pizzas using Bitcoins in 2010. The volatile cryptocurrency, a single unit of which currently buys $3798.48, has come a long way since then.  Investors recently celebrated 'Bitcoin Pizza Day'. It's not clear what the favoured type of pizza was. Photo: Supplied 2:36pm on 7 Jun 2017 Chinese steel futures have edged up after a nine-day fall, although the outlook for demand in the world's top consumer remained weak. The price recovery, which follows an 11 per cent decline since May 22, may be technical in nature, said Richard Lu, analyst at CRU consultancy. "We think the current market remains very, very slow. The recent price slump should make buyers hesitant to buy because the price can go down again so they just want to slow down purchases," he said. The most-active rebar on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was up 0.6 per cent at 2959 yuan ($US436) a tonne.  Construction activity usually eases in China during summer, curbing steel consumption. On the Dalian Commodity Exchange, the most-traded iron ore contract is up 0.1 per cent at 432.5 yuan. Supply of the steelmaking raw material remains high in China. Imported iron ore at the country's ports reached 136.55 million tonnes as of June 2, only down slightly from the previous week's 136.6 million tonnes which was the most for the stockpiles since 2004. Spot iron ore prices regained some lost ground overnight, rising 0.2 pre cent to $US56.03, after falling to near eight-month lows in the previous day. Some minor relief for iron ore prices. Photo: Vincent Mundy 2:17pm on 7 Jun 2017 There's been a lot of talk about Australia's record-breaking spell of economic growth without a recession. At last count it's now been 103 quarters since the 1991 recession (the one "we had to have"); that's close to 26 years without two consecutive quarters of shrinking economic output. While there's some nit-picking around the international comparisons (apparently Japan's post-WW2 growth period was longer, and the Dutch miracle ended either much earlier or a bit later), it's clearly a remarkable run. However, it should be mentioned that one factor contributing to our long stretch without a recession is Australia's relatively strong population growth of around 1.4 per cent a year. BetaShares chief economist David Bassanese notes that on a GDP-per capita basis, the economy has in fact experienced two technical recessions since the early 1990s – one in 2000 and again in 2006 (see chart). 2:04pm on 7 Jun 2017 Here's what economists are saying about today's first-quarter GDP numbers, which came in as weak as predicted: Felicity Emmett, ANZ: Some of the weakness in Q1 is likely to prove temporary, although a bounce in Q2 looks unlikely at this stage. More broadly, there looks to have been a sustained step-down in the pace of consumer spending growth as households adjust to the new world order of very low wage growth. On that front, wages growth actually picked up in the quarter, but growth in unit labour costs remains negligible, which suggests that inflation is likely to stay low. On this whole, this confirms our view that the RBA is on hold for some time. Paul Dales, Capital Economics: The small 0.3% q/q rise in GDP in the first quarter won't worry the RBA too much as some of it was due to the temporary influence of the severe weather. Nonetheless, we believe that GDP growth will be weaker than the RBA expects both this year and next, although that probably still won't prompt it to cut interest rates further. More generally, the 4.3% q/q rise in mining investment was the first since 2013 and is an encouraging sign that we are getting close to the end of the mining bust. Paul Bloxham, HSBC: The key challenge remains that, although corporate profits and nominal GDP have picked up, largely driven by the rise in commodity prices, this has yet to show up in wages growth. Compensation of employees rose in Q1, following a fall in Q4 2016, but is still running at a weak 1.5% y-o-y. At this stage there is little evidence of the boost to national incomes is flowing through to households. However, history suggests that it will. Yesterday's decision to lift the minimum wage by more than in previous rounds may very well be the first sign of this starting to happen. Rahul Bajoria, Barclays: Despite the slowdown in growth, there are a few positive takeaways for policymakers in today's GDP print. First, growth in household income, which has been a key focus, rebounded in Q1, despite a decline in hours worked and anemic wage growth. Second, private non-mining business investment expanded for the first time in more than 11 quarters, supporting the RBA's view that the mining-related adjustment in capex is coming close to an end. Finally, the strong revival of nominal GDP growth is a positive for national income and should have positive spillovers for both the public sector and, eventually, households.  Su-Lin Ong, RBC Capital Markets: Digging through the accounts, we would make a few observations. Firstly, the weaker real vs. stronger nominal/income story largely reflects upside surprises to commodity prices for much of the period since mid 2016 and is unlikely to continue. Secondly, the gain in national income remains very much skewed toward corporates. Thirdly, the composition of domestic demand in Q1 hints at a profile further into 2017 and more so in 2018, which likely shifts away from residential construction, which has been a key contributor to both growth and employment. Fourth, the wage, consumption, and household savings dynamics remain worrying. And finally, the persistently weak trend in unit labour costs, which are the key driver of non-tradable inflation and feed into the inflation outlook over the next 4-6 quarters, suggests that the risk lies in core inflation staying below the floor of the RBA's 2-3% target range for longer.  Craig James, CommSec: The Australian economy has had to contend with a lot of factors in the past year – geopolitics, weather events, the on-going unwinding of the mining construction boom and variable housing markets. So economic growth has trekked a zig-zag path. But importantly the record expansion remains on track. Especially positive is the health of the business sector with business conditions the best in nine years. The hope is that employment and investment will continue to lift, maintaining economic momentum. Ben Jarman, JPMorgan: The 1Q national accounts add to the string of data on the activity side showing that the economy is below trend and will not be reducing excess capacity soon. With the household sector subject to further headwinds from rising interest servicing costs, the pressure on the RBA's 3% and above GDP forecast continues to mount. Riki Polygenis, NAB: Today's data are consistent with monetary policy remaining on hold. The RBA will look through the volatility in GDP, however mixed labour market outcomes and weak wages and inflation data will prevent any hike. Meanwhile, there is tentative evidence that macroprudential and policy changes are leading to a softening in dwelling price growth, which will help to mitigate economic risks associated with rising household debt levels should it continue. Back to top 1:36pm on 7 Jun 2017 The tide has well and truly turned on Blackmores, the vitamins group, with its shares sliding today to $90, a level not seen since August 2015. Just in case you've forgotten, the shares hit a peak of $220.90 at the start of 2016, as optimism over Chinese demand for its products was at its highs. Since then, the shares have suffered a severe reality check although earlier in the week Morningstar reminded clients the slide in the share price to below $101 put them firmly within its 'accumulate' zone. It remains keen on Blackmore's leverage to Asian demand. Shares are down about 3 per cent at $89.64, after earlier dropping to $88.18. 1:35pm on 7 Jun 2017 And here is a round-up of the day's action so far on the ASX:   1:20pm on 7 Jun 2017 Citi analysts have branded the private equity offer for Vocus at $3.50 a share "an opportunistic offer based on depressed earnings". They estimate the KKR bid values the telco on an enterprise-value-to-EBITDA ratio of 8, and a P/E of 13.3. "However, we do not believe that our FY18 estimate is reflective of a normalised performance of the business," they write. "In our view, it will take more than 12 months to get Vocus back on track, and if Vocus had been able to maintain the sales of the pre-merger businesses, and extract just half of the synergies management had expected, earnings would be closer to $435m (our FY19 estimate)." On those, more "normal" earnings estimates, the KKR bid values the company at an EV/EBITDA of 7.4. Still, the offer is above Citi's current valuation of $3.40 per share. And the market had pushed the share price 20 per cent higher today to $3.41. The Citi analysts conclude: Given the highly conditional nature of the preliminary offer, we think this is unlikely to be sufficient for VOC to grant due diligence. With the current share price depressed due to recent earnings downgrades and capex commitments bringing debt covenants into play, in our view the key motivation is the opportunity to buy underperforming assets at an attractive price. Geoff Horth, CEO of Vocus. Photo: NIC_WALKER 1:06pm on 7 Jun 2017 Illustration: Matt Golding.  Deepening concerns that public investors in Murray Goulburn will bear the brunt of the costs of the planned restructure of the milk processor saw units in the co-operative pushed to new lows. In late morning trading, units in Murray Goulburn were down 15 per cent at 62c, a new all-time low. That followed a 12 per cent dive on Tuesday, when the company signalled a deeper than expected restructuring. The stock is now trading well below its 2015 float price of $2.10. The latest restructuring may see the company's profit sharing mechanism and the payout ratio altered, which will see much of the milk processors' woes borne by investors, analysts warned.  Bell Potter warned clients the foreshadowed comprehensive strategic review "is extremely ambiguous and could mean anything from collapsing the existing corporate structure to announcing a shift in the profit sharing mechanism and payout ratio (to retain capital)". "In our view the strategic review possess a material risk to the current earnings model, creating material uncertainty around any earnings and dividend forecasts in FY18-19." Even though the turn in the dairy cycle should favour investing in Murray Goulburn's units, there is "limited visibility on the possible effect the strategic review", the analyst warned. "We are therefore cautious [Murray Goulburn] will not provide investors with the same operating leverage to a rising [milk price] that it currently does under the profit sharing mechanism and reflect this risk in both our target price and rating," the analyst said as he cut to 'hold' from 'buy' his rating for the shares, while slashing to 73c from $1.11 the price target. 12:41pm on 7 Jun 2017 It's getting to that time of year when fast money fund managers and trading desks go looking for reporting season surprises.  Macquarie analysts weighed into the debate this morning, running the numbers on the last reported franking credit balances of Australian stocks.  Perennial table-toppers BHP and Rio Tinto were carrying the most franking credits as at their most recent financial year end on an absolute basis. Macquarie noted that both companies make most of their earnings in Australia, however their dual-listings meant only a partial payout of franking credits. In terms of surprises, Macquarie analysts said Westpac had grown its franking balance strongly, while Newcrest Mining's had been in retreat since 2013.  The analysts said Salmat had the highest franking balance as a proportion of its market capitalisation.  Franking credits, which are created when company's pay tax in Australia and can pass that benefit on to Australian shareholders, are one factor that can spur a company to pursue capital management and return those credits to shareholders in the form of off-market buybacks or special dividends.  Franking credits of Austraian listed companies as a percentage of market capitalisation, according to Macquarie analysts.   Back to top 12:23pm on 7 Jun 2017 Qantas's share price, which has risen meteorically this year, will continue to "look after itself" as long as the airline sticks to its cost-cutting targets and delivers consistent earnings, chief executive Alan Joyce says. Mr Joyce said constant reinvention was needed to remain competitive and profitable in the tight-margin industry, even as Qantas finishes a three-year cost-cutting drive to save $2 billion and grows more popular with investors. The airline is now trying to save $400 million a year in further cost cutting.  "Three years ago we said we would deliver on $2 billion in transformation, and we've now given ourselves our targets for the next three years and  management's focused on delivering on that," Mr Joyce said from the sidelines of the International Air Transportation Association's annual general meeting in Cancun, Mexico. "When we deliver on that, the share price will certainly look after itself." Qantas' share price has risen almost 60 per cent in the past six months, from $3.34 on January 1 to $5.09 on Wednesday.  A bullish forecast at an investor day in May further encouraged the market and saw Moody's up its credit rating. Major savings will come from the first of its Boeing 787-9s, which are more fuel efficient and have lower operating costs than the 747s they will replace, Mr Joyce said.  The first Qantas 787 will start flying Melbourne to LA in December, with the second to pick up the new non-stop service between London and Perth from March. That new Kangaroo Route will start in Melbourne and replace Qantas' existing Melbourne to London service, which operates on A380s and stops in Dubai. Read more.

Not sure what the RBA are seeing. Rose tints!— MM (@macromusing) June 7, 2017 11:32am on 7 Jun 2017 GDP numbers have come in pretty much as predicted, but there's not denying the economy slowed sharply in the first quarter, as consumers cut spending and resources export volumes were hit by bad weather. Gross domestic product rose just 0.3 per cent in the March quarter from the previous three months, when it climbed by 1.1 per cent. Year-on-year growth slowed to 1.7 per cent, from 2.4 per cent. Economists had forecast growth of 0.3 per cent and 1.6 per cent respectively. The Aussie bounced about a third of a cent to a fresh one-month high of US75.29¢, as traders had been bracing for a disappointment. 11:22am on 7 Jun 2017 Ignore the fanfare, the Adani coal mine is no closer to lift-off, writes BusinessDay columnist Elizabeth Knight: In the real world of finance, listed companies must adhere to strict rules on disclosure. Indian conglomerate Adani isn't covered by these rules but, if it were, Tuesday's media release headline – Adani Project gets green light – would be misleading to say the least. It seems the $16 billion, highly controversial Carmichael coal mine is no closer to lift-off than it was last month, or last year, and, it can be argued, it has not progressed that far beyond where it was even five years ago. It was merely an announcement that Adani wanted the project to go ahead. But, realistically, that is only one hurdle this project faces. Finding the finance for it is a bigger issue and one that cannot be addressed with a media release. Yes, there was a media conference in northern Queensland and, yes, federal and state politicians turned up for the photo opportunity as a show of support for a new mine and rail line that would create jobs. But not even a sod of earth was turned. Meanwhile, a far more reliable indication of whether Tuesday's announcement should be taken seriously can be found in the response to Downer EDI's share price. This is the company Adani said on Tuesday had been given the very large and valuable contract to build the mine. The share price didn't move. Indeed, Downer, which is subject to ASX disclosure laws, released a far more circumspect statement in which it said the "letter of award [of the Adani contract] continues to be subject to the parties executing a binding mining services contract". In other words, the contracts with Downer and others Adani had earmarked as being parties to this giant project were all hostage to the project actually going ahead. And that requires financing, which Adani still does not have. And the fact that Adani wants to source steel from the bankrupt Whyalla Arrium steelworks means little if its Carmichael mine cannot get finance. Read more here. Gautam Adani and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.   11:13am on 7 Jun 2017 Heads up: we get first-quarter GDP numbers in about 20 minutes. Economists have been busily revising their forecasts down, with consensus at 0.3 per cent quarterly growth and 1.6 per cent annual growth, according to the latest Bloomberg survey. But after yesterday's disappointing GDP partials government spending and net exports, which will both weigh on the final number, it's quite possible that the 'whisper numbers' doing the rounds among traders are actually lower than the consensus estimate.  Many economists resist revising their forecasts too many times and quite possibly held off from a final downgrade yesterday following the partials. Plus, after the RBA yesterday downplayed the likely softness for Q1, any reaction in the Australian dollar will likely be muted.  Still, a negative reading is unlikely to resound well with traders, and could well pull the Aussie back below US75¢. One thing to look out for is annual change in unit labour costs, which is likely to remain in negative territory. "This ongoing weakness in unit labour costs will continue to feed through to lower inflation and puts a question mark over the RBA's view that inflation is likely to accelerate back into the 2–3% target band over the next couple of years," says ANZ's Daniel Been.  NAB is on the bearish side of forecasts, predicting quarterly GDP slipped 0.1 per cent.  Back to top Search pagination Current page Live Article Posts1 Next Live Article Posts2 Share via Email Post on facebook wall Share on Google Plus Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit 1 new post(s) available.

So reports The Wall Street Journal. Merrill said it recently recruited five brokers from UBS who oversaw $4.3 billion for clients, and two others who managed more than $1.1 billion from J.P.

The hires came just before Merrill instituted a moratorium on broker recruiting on June 1. Merrill told broker managers last month that it would develop a new incentive package to court the industry’s biggest brokers and test a pilot program focused on hiring brokers with three to five years of experience. Brokers already in talks to join Merrill weren’t affected by the decision. A Merrill spokeswoman declined to say how many brokers were hired altogether before the pause. Merrill, UBS and Morgan Stanley have all pledged to step back from aggressively recruiting brokers. Executives had called the practice costly because of the hefty checks—sometimes reaching more than three times the fees and commissions a broker generates—brokers commanded for moving their practices.

(Dean Rutz/Seattle Times/TNS)   By Josh Boak The Associated Press June 7, 2017   Today’s Business stories BMW enters car-sharing niche 5 big tech stocks build market euphoria, and jitters Oregon onion industry faces challenging times Lowe’s to lay off about 125 workers, move jobs to India Ford increasing summer production of SUVs More Business »   WASHINGTON — Leading U.S. CEOs remain supportive of some of President Trump’s policy initiatives despite his still-hazy plan for cutting taxes and recent actions by Trump that have intensified attention on federal investigations of his campaign. The Business Roundtable, a trade association for CEOs, said Tuesday that the executives’ economic outlook has reached its highest level in three years — a reading of 93.9, which suggests continued economic growth. The association found in its survey of CEOs that plans for capital investment rose 4.6 percentage points since the first quarter, while sales expectations increased 0.5 percentage point. Still, the executives’ hiring plans for the next six months suggested a potential slowdown. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase and chairman of the roundtable, suggested that the results reflect confidence in the prospect for overhauling taxes and in the administration’s “commitment to creating a more favorable regulatory environment.” Dimon, speaking on a conference call with reporters, said “the urgency for tax reform couldn’t be overstated.” The roundtable has been advocating lower corporate tax rates and a shift toward a territorial tax system, whereby companies would pay only on the income earned in each country. A majority of the organization’s members have said they would delay hiring and investment plans if the tax overhaul pledged by Trump and congressional Republicans became stalled. The Trump administration has released only a one-page outline of general principles on taxes, which stress lower rates for business and personal income. But its outline was so vague on key details as to raise doubts about the viability of rewriting the tax code this year while also passing a budget, raising the federal debt limit and overturning the federal health care law.

(Photo: Richard Drew / AP) 9 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Washington — Leading U.S. CEOs remain supportive of some of President Donald Trump’s policy initiatives despite his still-hazy plan for cutting taxes and recent actions by Trump that have intensified attention on federal investigations of his campaign. The Business Roundtable, a trade association for CEOs, said Tuesday that the executives’ economic outlook has reached its highest level in three years — a reading of 93.9, which suggests continued economic growth. The association found in its survey of CEOs that plans for capital investment rose 4.6 percentage points since the first quarter, while sales expectations increased 0.5 percentage point. Still, the executives’ hiring plans for the next six months suggested a potential slowdown. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase and chairman of the roundtable, suggested that the results reflect confidence in the prospect for overhauling taxes and in the administration’s “commitment to creating a more favorable regulatory environment.” Dimon, speaking on a conference call with reporters, said “the urgency for tax reform couldn’t be overstated.” The roundtable has been advocating lower corporate tax rates and a shift toward a territorial tax system, whereby companies would pay only on the income earned in each country. A majority of the organization’s members have said they would delay hiring and investment plans if the tax overhaul pledged by Trump and congressional Republicans became stalled. The Trump administration has released only a one-page outline of general principles on taxes, which stress lower rates for business and personal income. But its outline was so vague on key details as to raise doubts about the viability of rewriting the tax code this year while also passing a budget, raising the federal debt limit and overturning the federal health care law. Much of Trump’s attention in recent weeks has been focused on the investigations being conducted of his presidential campaign, including by Robert Mueller, a special counsel. Mueller was appointed after Trump fired the FBI director, James Comey, who was looking into ties between Russia and Trump’s campaign. Comey is to testify Thursday on Capitol Hill. Josh Bolten, a former White House chief of staff who is president and CEO of the roundtable, said the organization’s survey results are a sign of “ongoing optimism for tax and regulatory changes.” 9 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: This Is Bad News for Bank Stocks Long-term interest rates are coming down, which could weigh on big bank stocks. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Jun 6, 2017 at 7:40PM When Donald Trump won the presidential election in November, the unexpected outcome reverberated through the markets. Equities climbed, bonds fell, and the so-called fear index, the VIX, began its descent to today's eerily low level. Few sectors in the stock market benefited from these trends as much as banks did, and the big banks in particular, including JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C). All of these stocks have handily outperformed the broader market since the beginning of November: BAC data by YCharts. The rationale for this performance has been threefold. First, Trump vowed on the campaign trail to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed in 2010 to combat the abuses that fueled the financial crisis. This would lower compliance costs at banks, and none more so than the too big to fail lenders like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup, all of which face heightened regulatory scrutiny under Dodd-Frank given their status as global systemically important banks, or G-SIBs. Second, Trump also promised to lower the corporate tax rate, from 35% down to 15%. There are short-term downsides to lower taxes from the perspective of Bank of America and Citigroup in particular, as a result of deferred tax assets (click on the link to learn more), but over the long run a 15% corporate income tax rate would allow banks like these to retain or distribute billions more in profits every year as opposed to giving that money to the government. Bank of America would emerge with somewhere around $3.5 billion in added net income, holding all else equal. JPMorgan Chase would save roughly $4.3 billion. Citigroup's benefit would come in at approximately $3.2 billion. Finally, Trump's promise to pour money into infrastructure projects, combined with other initiatives, could spur inflation, which would presumably prod the Federal Reserve into raising interest rates. In the immediate wake of the election, in fact, that's exactly what happened, with the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds gaining nearly 100 basis points, or 1 full percentage point. That's a huge move given the size of the market for 10-year Treasuries. 10 Year Treasury Rate data by YCharts. The Fed followed this up in December and March by increasing the Fed funds rate, which is the key short-term interest rate benchmark in the United States, by a combined 50 basis points. These moves have already translated into substantially more profit at JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and virtually every other bank in country. The 25-basis-point boost in December alone increased Bank of America's net interest income by just under $600 million a quarter. The further increase in March of this year should add another $150 million a quarter in net interest income. The bad news for banks now, however, is that interest rates are heading in the opposite direction. The yield on 10-year Treasuries is currently at its lowest point of the year, as investors flood into what many perceive to be the world's safest asset. And assuming that things continue to heat up in Washington, D.C., which seems like a safe assumption, this could get even worse. The net result is that banks' previous forecasts for higher revenue from net interest income may need to be tempered. And if that does turn out to be the case, then investors shouldn't be surprised to see the news weigh on big bank stocks. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America.

Idaho Business Health Marijuana Nation World Photos Business Trump picks former CEO of OneWest Bank for key financial regulatory post UPDATED: Tue., June 6, 2017, 4:55 p.m. By Jim Puzzanghera and James Rufus Koren Los Angeles Times Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump intends to nominate Joseph Otting, the former chief executive of OneWest Bank and an ally of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, to a key financial regulatory position. The move drew fire from consumer advocates and a key Senate Democrat, who pointed out that Otting would be in a position of overseeing banks even though one he ran was scolded by regulators for its conduct during the financial crisis. Otting is being tapped to be the comptroller of the currency, a powerful regulator who oversees federally chartered banks, the White House announced Monday. Those include the banking arms of some of the larger financial institutions in the country, including JP Morgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. His role with Pasadena, Calif.-based OneWest, which has been criticized for its foreclosure practices, made Otting’s nomination concerning, said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. “If Mr. Otting didn’t deal fairly with the customers at his own bank, it’s difficult to see why he’s the best choice to look out for the interests of customers at more than 1,400 banks and thrifts across the country,” he said. Brown is the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, which must confirm the nomination. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is an independent bureau of the Treasury Department, was a pivotal player in the $185 million settlement last year with Wells Fargo involving its creation of unauthorized accounts. Otting would replace Keith Noreika, a banking industry lawyer whom Trump appointed last month as acting comptroller of the currency to replace Thomas Curry after his five-year term expired. Otting’s nomination is likely to revive Democratic criticisms of Mnuchin regarding the practices of OneWest Bank. They were a key factor in Mnuchin’s narrow 53-47 confirmation in February, the slimmest margin ever for a Treasury secretary. In 2009, Mnuchin led a group of investors who put up about $1.6 billion to buy the failed IndyMac bank, a leading subprime mortgage lender, and renamed it OneWest. Otting was hired as OneWest’s chief executive the following year. Mnuchin served as the bank’s chairman from 2009-15. Democrats accused the bank of being “a foreclosure machine” that helped Mnuchin profit from the 2008 financial crisis, which left many homeowners unable to make their mortgage payments. The bank was sold to CIT Group in 2015 for $3.4 billion. Mnuchin denied the allegations, saying the bank was trying to deal with IndyMac’s poor mortgage portfolio. Nevertheless, the Office of Thrift Supervision, a savings-and-loan regulator that merged into the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, chided the bank for its practices during Mnuchin’s ownership and Otting’s leadership. In 2011, the agency said in a regulatory order that OneWest had engaged in robo-signing – the practice of having workers sign mortgage- and foreclosure-related documents without reviewing them or verifying they were accurate. “The president’s choice for watchdog of America’s largest banks is someone who signed a consent order – over shady foreclosure practices – with the very agency he’s been selected to run,” Brown noted. Like acting Comptroller Noreika, the previous five comptrollers have all been lawyers, and most have a record of public service. Curry, whom Noreika replaced, was a state bank overseer in Massachusetts and a director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. before being appointed as comptroller in 2011. Curry’s predecessors, John Dugan and John Hawke Jr., were both attorneys who had worked in private practice as well as for the Treasury Department and for congressional committees, according to the OCC, which maintains a list of all former comptrollers. Otting, by contrast, has no record of government service and has spent his career in commercial banking. If approved, he would be the first former top bank executive to lead the bank regulatory agency in nearly a century. That troubles some critics, who say putting Otting atop the regulatory agency would amount to allowing banks to regulate themselves. “Are bank regulators there to work for the banks, or are they there to ensure banks are safe and sound and not risking the economy?” said Paulina Gonzalez, executive director of the California Reinvestment Coalition and a vocal critic of OneWest. “Putting Joseph Otting in this position is risking the livelihood of everyday Americans.” Bartlett Naylor, financial policy advocate at Public Citizen, a public interest group, said Trump showed he doesn’t care about victims of the financial crisis. And Naylor said Otting’s relationship with Mnuchin raised ethical questions. “Will Otting be independent of political interests from the president’s Treasury secretary? Or will he reprise his role as Mnuchin’s employee?” Naylor said. Otting would fit in with the Trump administration’s preference for appointees that come from the business world rather than from Washington. Mnuchin, too, lacks the inside-the-Beltway experience shared by most of his predecessors. Treasury secretaries appointed by Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush all worked for the federal government at some point in their careers. But while Mnuchin is a creature of Wall Street – he is the son of a former Goldman Sachs partner and spent 17 years at that firm – Otting is a classic main-street banker. He spent the bulk of his career in the business lending divisions of Union Bank and US Bancorp. Lloyd Greif, a longtime L.A. investment banker, said he’s known Otting since his days at Union Bank and that Otting’s experience makes him a shoo-in for comptroller. “He’s been at community banks, he’s been at money center banks – he has the experience that really spans the gamut,” Greif said. “Steve (Mnuchin) is a Wall Streeter, but Joseph is a dyed-in-the-wool commercial banker.” ( Updated: June 6, 2017, 4:55 p.m.  Tags: Donald Trump, Joseph Otting, OneWest Bank Click here to comment on this story » Most read stories Argonne Road now open after crash near Stoneman Road … Park Board to vote Thursday on removing pledge to re-cover Riverfront Park Pavilion … Spokane County’s insurer offers $2.25 million settlement to three men wrongfully convicted of robber … Spokane city prosecutor running for municipal court judge seat arrested Sunday after allegedly drivi … Spokane Police investigate Homeland Security contractor for alleged rape and burglary … ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

The CEOs remain hopeful about a sweeping overhaul of the tax code, including a steep cut in the corporate rate, despite limited details so far from the White House and the lack of formal legislation in Congress. Those developments have led the Trump administration to back off its expectation to get tax reform enacted by August. But hopes remain high that major tax changes are coming soon, according to the 148 chief executives surveyed this month by the Business Roundtable trade group. “The survey results reflect confidence from America’s leading employers in the prospects for tax reform as well as the tangible economic benefits that tax reform will produce,” said Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan Chase & Co., and chairman of the group, which is composed of the heads of about 200 of the largest U.S companies. Its CEO Economic Outlook Index increased to 93.9 in the second quarter, up slightly from the first quarter, boosted by stronger expectations for capital spending. The index is based on projections for sales, capital spending and hiring over the next six months, and ranges from minus-50 to 150, with a reading above 50 indicating that the economy is expanding. Since the survey began in 2002, the average has been 80. In the first quarter, the index jumped by its most in seven years as Mr. Trump took office with promises to slash taxes and regulations. But Trump’s agenda has been slowed as the White House deals with controversies, such as investigations into possible collusion by campaign officials with Russia during the 2016 election. “Of course, whenever there are distractions from the agenda that we want to see accomplished in Washington, everybody’s concerned,” said Business Roundtable President Joshua Bolten, who served as White House chief of staff during the George W. Bush administration. “But I’d be careful not to overstate that concern,” he said. “What the survey reflects is ongoing optimism about the prospect for ongoing regulatory reform … and the prospect for tax reform.” Trump wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent, which is the highest among developed economies. He also wants to eliminate U.S. taxes on foreign earnings. “The urgency of tax reform cannot be overstated,” Dimon said. A separate Business Roundtable survey last month showed that tax reform would boost corporate spending and hiring, while a delay would cause CEOs to hold off on those moves. In the latest survey, CEOs scaled down their projection for economic growth this year to 2 percent from a 2.2 percent estimate in the first quarter. The index for capital spending plans increased while expectations for sales remained essentially flat. Plans to expand payrolls decreased somewhat, although Bolten noted that came after a big jump in hiring expectations in the first quarter.

Bankruptcy court may be the wrong place for banks to meet their maker, the former Federal Reserve chairman said on Tuesday at the Brookings Institution in Washington. A chaotic failure on Wall Street would be just too damaging and so regulators should have another option ready. "Under circumstances like we had in 2008 I really don't see (bankruptcy) as being realistic," Bernanke said. Bernanke ran the central bank during the 2008 meltdown and constructed emergency rescue plans for the financial system alongside Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and then-New York Fed President Timothy Geithner. Financial reforms put in place since then have granted regulators so-called "Orderly Liquidation Authority" allowing them to seize a teetering bank and execute a living will put together by the bank. Big banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc have been submitting resolution plans for approval and incorporating feedback from regulators for years. However, a new reform plan backed by Republican lawmakers would erase some of those provisions. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, who is leading the effort, has said bankruptcy court is a better option because it eliminates the risk that taxpayers would have to bail out a failing institution. During the 2008 crisis, the federal government injected hundreds of billions of dollars into big banks, insurer American International Group Inc, mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and automakers, whose financing arms were in trouble. The Fed also invented multitrillion-dollar liquidity programs and set interest rates to zero to stabilize financial markets. Much of the mayhem erupted after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008. Stock markets swung dramatically in the following weeks as investors worried regulators would not be able to save the system from collapse. Lehman’s bankruptcy has been playing out in court for years. Given that experience, Bernanke said his successors will need "weekend-type speed." "The bankruptcy system," he said, "has no need for speed."

The Sell-Side Weighs In Wayne Duggan , Benzinga Staff Writer     {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} June 06, 2017 3:42pm   Comments Share: Related AAPL Netflix Vs. Amazon Prime: The Battle For Apple TV Screen Time AMD's Ryzen Chips Facing Some Problems How Apple Anti-Cookie Tools Could Impact Facebook, Amazon, Snap (Investor's Business Daily) Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) investors and enthusiasts are excited about the new products and development tools Apple unveiled at its World Wide Developer Conference on Monday. Apple unveiled new augmented reality development toolkit ARKit, Siri speaker device HomePod, peer-to-peer payment platform Pay Cash, watchOS 4, a 10.5-inch iPad, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) integration with Apple TV and other new technology at this week’s event. What does Wall Street think of this year’s WWDC? Here’s what several major firms have to say about Apple and WWDC. See Also: Everything You Need To Know From Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference 2017 Keynote Address Wall Street's Reaction Nomura says news from the conference “illustrates why Apple’s customer satisfaction is at 96%, which is a key part of the bullish thesis around the iPhone 8 launch in September.” UBS analyst Steven Milunovich says most of the technology improvements were “incremental” but added “there were some important new offerings, led by HomePod, a ‘breakthrough wireless speaker’ that also answers queries as do Alexa and Google Home.” JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall says the “large multitasking enhancements to the iPad were potentially the most financially impactful part of the keynote as they move the iPad a little closer to a full laptop replacement option – particularly with the new 10.5’ screen size also announced at the event.” Baird analyst William Power says, “Longer term, ARKit and the new peer-to-peer payment platform via iMessage open significant opportunities.” Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner says the HomePod device and the peer-to-peer payment products are “interesting additions to the Apple ecosystem” but that they are “not substantially different from existing offerings from other companies in these categories in our view.” Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi says, “Yesterday’s announcements reaffirm the likelihood of 3D Sensing technology in the iPhone 8.” Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster says, “ARKIT is the single most important announcement from today’s keynote, enhancing iOS 11 devices for augmented reality.” Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha says, “Across the portfolio we begin to see the payoffs of the company's multi-year investments in Machine Learnings and Augmented Reality as well as improvements to the iPad line-up, Apple Pay and Siri, in addition to a new intelligent home speaker – HomePod.” Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan says, “A noticeable feature in many of the products discussed today was the inclusion of machine learning, Augmented (AR) & Virtual Reality (VR) applications, which strengthens the case for Apple to release its own AR/VR hardware at a later date.” See Also: Even If Apple's New Products Are 'Stupid,' Cramer Says People Will Still Buy Them Where is Apple Stock Headed? Overall Wall Street remains extremely bullish on Apple, with a handful of exceptions. Here’s a breakdown of the ratings and price targets of the firms mentioned above: Nomura has a Buy rating and $165 price target. UBS has a Buy rating and $170 price target.

The quirky case arose after lawyers accidentally terminated a senior loan by filing the wrong form in 2008, jeopardizing the rights of about 500 secured creditors. JPMorgan Chase & Co., an agent on the loan, is arguing that the mistake shouldn’t wipe out all their rights; some collateral wasn’t affected because additional filings under the Uniform Commercial Code, or UCC, protected its right to fixtures at some GM plants. General Motors’ current operations have no part in the suit. High Stakes The case could topple a pillar of secured finance -- a part of the UCC states that lenders are protected against unauthorized termination of asset-based loans, the Commercial Finance Association said in a 2013 court filing. An adverse finding may “dramatically increase the risk to lenders who underwrite asset-based loans” and drive up borrowing costs, it said. The agency stands by that today, spokeswoman Michele Ocejo said, adding that “clear wording” in the UCC supports its position. If the judge rules against JPMorgan, unsecured creditors including the U.S. Treasury and Export Development Canada stand to benefit. “It could be a big mess and we could be asked to play a role in how it gets resolved,” said Elliot Ganz, general counsel for the Loan Syndications and Trading Association. JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony declined to comment. The ruling also threatens the long-standing relationship between JPMorgan and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, which signed off on the erroneous loan termination. Simpson Thacher spokesman Tom Orewyler and a lawyer for JPMorgan declined to comment on whether JPMorgan would turn on Simpson Thacher if it loses, and whether malpractice insurance would cover the verdict. So how did one lawyer’s mistake turn into a legal battle over the semantics of “fixture” that threatens a white-shoe law firm, the lending market, and more than 500 lenders to old GM?  ‘Nice Job’ It started in 2006, when General Motors took out a $1.5 billion term loan. The loan was secured by a first-priority interest in equipment, fixtures, documents, books and records, and proceeds at 42 GM facilities across the U.S. Following the usual protocol, JPMorgan filed a UCC statement about those fixtures. It went on to file additional UCC statements covering a subset of its plants, according to court records. Then, on Oct. 20, 2008, a paralegal and an associate with Mayer Brown LLP -- counsel responsible for a different GM loan -- went to terminate that debt, but mistakenly filed forms for the $1.5 billion term loan instead, according to court papers. When Simpson Thacher, which JPMorgan looked to for legal counsel on the loan, reviewed the filings, it found no error, a judge said in a 2013 opinion. “Nice job on the documents,” a Simpson Thacher lawyer said, according to the ruling. Then GM went bankrupt. Shortly after, the company repaid the $1.5 billion loan using some of its $33 billion in government bailout funds. When unsecured creditors later discovered the mistaken filing, they argued it made JPMorgan an unsecured creditor, just like them -- and entitled to mere cents on the dollar. Settlement Talks Some of the term-loan lenders, such as Ares Management LP, Eaton Vance Corp. and Fidelity Investments, have grouped together to file their own pleadings, saying they have hundreds of millions at stake. There are also disputes about when different lenders were officially notified, an imbroglio one lawyer referred to in court papers as “50 shades of notice.” Several judgments have already been made: A bankruptcy court first ruled that the mistaken filing didn’t terminate the liens because it had been submitted in error, making JPMorgan the victor. An appeal to the second circuit reversed that decision in 2013, and sent the case back to the bankruptcy court to enter summary judgment on behalf of unsecured creditors.

Sign Up After the appeal verdict, Wachtell Lipton Rosen & Katz took up JPMorgan’s battle, arguing that secondary UCC filings protected JPMorgan’s liens on many assets that are fixtures, or physically attached to property. The debate has focused on 40 assets that are seen as representative of about 170,000 assets. Valuation method has also been at issue, with JPMorgan saying that the collateral is worth more than the loan, entitling it to keep all the $1.5 billion repaid after the bankruptcy. Settlement talks are expected to follow a ruling. “Removing a stamping press is difficult, dangerous and expensive,” lawyers for JPMorgan argued in a 500-page recap of the trial that described how the metal-shaping tool should be considered a fixture because, if removed, it would leave a 20-foot deep hole.

It may get tougher Trump plan to overhaul labor watchdogs faces opposition © Provided by USA Today JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Top CEOs are largely maintaining their investment and hiring plans amid continued confidence in President Trump’s tax and regulatory reform agenda despite the probe into his ties with Russia and snags in Congress. Quotes in the article JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▲ 85.11 +1.23 +1.46% AdChoices But a derailment of the president’s proposals would douse their optimism and curtail their hiring and investment blueprint, according to the Business Roundtable’s second-quarter survey. CEOs of the nation’s largest companies modestly stepped up their capital spending plans while reining in their hiring intentions a bit, but an overall index of their outlook for sales, investment and employment rose marginally to the highest level in three years. “We remain confident that Congress and the Administration will coalesce around a plan for meaningful tax reform,” JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who is chairman of the Roundtable, said in a conference call with reporters. The top executives also “remain very positive about the direction of the economy,” said Joshua Bolten, CEO of the Roundtable. Forty-three percent of those surveyed plan to increase capital spending over the next six months, down from 46% in the first quarter. But just 6% plan to reduce investment, down from 13%, pushing up the capital spending index modestly. Meanwhile, 36% say they’ll increase in employment, down from 41%. Just 16% plan to cut staffing, down from 18% early in the year. The employment index fell slightly. And 77% of the CEOs expect sales to rise the next six months while just 3% expect a decrease. Early in the year, 78% anticipated an sales  increase and 4% projected a drop. Overall, the business Roundtable’s index edged up to 93.9 in the second quarter from 93.3 the first three months of the year. The indexes long-term average is 80. The CEOs’ confidence soared early in the year as Trump took office but his plan for corporate and individual tax cuts has been called into question amid deepening controversy about his ties to Russia’s interference in the U.S. presidential campaign. At the same time, Trump’s proposed tax cuts have been threatened by political opposition to plans to offset the reductions through a border adjustment tax or  a health care reform bill. Trump has proposed slashing the corporate tax rate to 15% from 35%.  “When there are distractions from the agenda, everybody’s concerned,” Bolten says. But, “talking to CEOs, I know the vast majority of them believe tax reform is not only possible but likely over the next year and they’re making their plans based on that.” Yet he added they would sharply scale back those plans  if the tax cut plan falteres. “There is also a potential downside of failure and that should add to the urgency…of pursuing reform.” Noting that large U.S. corporations earn returns that are 60% higher overseas because of lower taxes there, Dimon said, “We have to do this for the good of our country.”  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

The brokerage currently has a $270.00 price target on the medical device company’s stock. Zacks Investment Research‘s target price would suggest a potential upside of 12.08% from the stock’s previous close. According to Zacks, “The Cooper Companies generates a significant part of its revenues in foreign currencies. Thus, the ongoing unfavorable currency translation is expected to negatively impact the company’s top-line growth in 2017. Furthermore, intensifying competition will continue to increase pricing pressure for the company. In this regard we note that, the company ended first-quarter fiscal 2017 with revenues missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. On a positive note, the company outperformed the broader industry in terms of price performance over the past six months. The Cooper Companies have always had an impressive show from its CooperSurgical business segment. The CooperVision segment also delivered strong sales in the last quarter, buoyed by robust performance by Toric. The company is expected to maintain a leading position in the markets of speciality lenses with highly exclusive products like Bioinfinity, Clarity and silicone hydrogel lenses.” COO has been the subject of a number of other research reports. Jefferies Group LLC raised their target price on shares of Cooper Companies from $210.00 to $220.00 and gave the company a “buy” rating in a research note on Friday, March 3rd. BMO Capital Markets reaffirmed a “buy” rating on shares of Cooper Companies in a research note on Friday, March 3rd.

Stifel Nicolaus raised their target price on shares of Cooper Companies from $220.00 to $231.00 and gave the company a “buy” rating in a research note on Friday.

Updated: June 7, 2017 @ 11:53 am Full Forecast News Sports Obituaries Opinion Buy & Sell Breaking New Trump FBI pick represented Christie in Bridgegate case AP Survey: Top CEOs still back some of Trump policy priorities By JOSH BOAK AP Economics Writer Jun 6, 2017 Updated 23 hrs ago 0 WASHINGTON (AP) — Leading U.S. CEOs remain supportive of some of President Donald Trump's policy initiatives despite his still-hazy plan for cutting taxes and recent actions by Trump that have intensified attention on federal investigations of his campaign. The Business Roundtable, a trade association for CEOs, said Tuesday that the executives' economic outlook has reached its highest level in three years — a reading of 93.9, which suggests continued economic growth. The association found in its survey of CEOs that plans for capital investment rose 4.6 percentage points since the first quarter, while sales expectations increased 0.5 percentage point. Still, the executives' hiring plans for the next six months suggested a potential slowdown. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase and chairman of the roundtable, suggested that the results reflect confidence in the prospect for overhauling taxes and in the administration's "commitment to creating a more favorable regulatory environment." Dimon, speaking on a conference call with reporters, said "the urgency for tax reform couldn't be overstated." The roundtable has been advocating lower corporate tax rates and a shift toward a territorial tax system, whereby companies would pay only on the income earned in each country. A majority of the organization's members have said they would delay hiring and investment plans if the tax overhaul pledged by Trump and congressional Republicans became stalled. The Trump administration has released only a one-page outline of general principles on taxes, which stress lower rates for business and personal income. But its outline was so vague on key details as to raise doubts about the viability of rewriting the tax code this year while also passing a budget, raising the federal debt limit and overturning the federal health care law. Much of Trump's attention in recent weeks has been focused on the investigations being conducted of his presidential campaign, including by Robert Mueller, a special counsel. Mueller was appointed after Trump fired the FBI director, James Comey, who was looking into ties between Russia and Trump's campaign. Comey is to testify Thursday on Capitol Hill. Josh Bolten, a former White House chief of staff who is president and CEO of the roundtable, acknowledged that issues that distract from the Trump administration's policy agenda remain a concern but that the organization's survey results are a sign of "ongoing optimism for tax and regulatory changes."

CEO Jamie Dimon.   “Arrived in China, as always impressed by condition of airport, roads, cell service, etc.,” Blankfein said in a tweet June 5. “U.S. needs to invest in infrastructure to keep up!” Arrived in China, as always impressed by condition of airport, roads, cell service, etc. US needs to invest in infrastructure to keep up! — Lloyd Blankfein (@lloydblankfein) June 6, 2017 Blankfein’s message — his third-ever tweet — echoed remarks from Dimon, who said the neglect damages economic growth. “I just came from Hong Kong — I mean, it’s embarrassing,” Dimon said in a Bloomberg Television interview June 5 in Beijing. “America, the can-do nation, should get back to building and constructing.” President Donald Trump has proposed leveraging $200 billion to generate a total of about $1 trillion from states, cities and private investors to rebuild America’s roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure. Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive who now leads Trump’s National Economic Council, has said the strategy can deliver substantial gains without new taxes. The American Society of Civil Engineers has estimated about $2 trillion in new funds are needed to do the job properly. Congressional Democrats have said they won’t support any plan that relies on tax breaks for wealthy investors, arguing that much more direct spending by Washington is needed.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    The Federal Reserve is getting ready to "normalize" the size of its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. A lot is at stake. Simply maintaining that over-sized stack of bonds makes the Fed a big player in the markets for Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. Investors and traders are anxious for information about how the central bank intends to pull back. "There are so many different parameters by which they could set this process," said Tom Simons, a senior economist at Jefferies LLC in New York. "There's a wide range of market implications as a result for what the public supply of Treasuries is going to be and how liquid the MBS market is going to be." What we know so far At the moment, when a bond in that portfolio matures or gets paid back early, the Fed reinvests the returned principal. To shrink the balance sheet, all the Fed has to do is stop reinvesting. But the idea of halting that process all at once makes the Fed nervous about possibly disrupting markets. Stopping now would shrink the portfolio by about $280 billion over the last seven months of 2017, and by about $650 billion in 2018, according to Walter Schmidt, the Chicago-based senior vice president at FTN Financial, and data from The Yield Book. At their May meeting, policy makers backed a plan to reduce each month's reinvestments by a set, and as-yet undecided, dollar amount. That sum will roll off the balance sheet and any maturities above the cap will be plowed back into the market. As long as that goes smoothly, the cap would then rise every three months until it reached a ceiling, or steady state, of monthly run-offs. That still leaves a number of crucial unanswered questions. Question 1: When will the draw-down start? Fed officials have said they favor getting started in the second half of this year, but they probably won't want the first move to coincide with an interest-rate hike. And they're on course to lift rates two more times this year. In the New York Fed's latest survey of primary dealers, respondents thought the Fed would most likely move forward with rate increases in June and September before beginning to trim the balance sheet in the fourth quarter. If the start time for the run-off moves up to September or before, expect the second of those rate hikes to be delayed. Question 2: Where will the Fed set the caps for monthly run-offs? A few weeks ago, many economists were predicting the Fed would kick off the process by shedding about $20 billion a month. Those estimates have been dropping, especially since the Fed revealed that it favored phasing in the roll-offs. Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist and partner at Cornerstone MacroLLC in Washington, expects the first cap to land at $10 billion, rising by $10 billion every three months before settling after 15 months at a steady state of $60 billion. Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., thinks they'll start at a combined $12 billion and add $12 billion each quarter. Question 3: How long will all this take? The precise answer here lies in the answers to the questions on the caps (see Question 2), which will determine the pace of runoffs, and on the preferred long-term size of the balance sheet, which depends on how officials want to manage short-term borrowing rates (see Question 5). Lacking those answers, it's safe only to say the whole process will take 5 to 10 years, assuming a recession doesn't come along and force the Fed to resume reinvestments, or even to buy whole new piles of bonds. Question 4: What will the mix be in the run-down between Treasuries and MBS? Of the $650 billion that could roll off the balance sheet in 2018 assuming no reinvestments, about $224 billion of that is in MBS, according to FTN's Schmidt. While officials haven't announced details about how they will handle the different sides of the portfolio, they have said they will look to tailor the plan to accommodate differences in the two markets. "I would be inclined to follow a similar approach in managing the reduction of the holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), calibrated according to their particular characteristics," Fed Governor Lael Brainard said May 30.  Some analysts expect the Fed to split the caps evenly between Treasuries and MBS. Others, including Shehriyar Antia, a former policy advisor in the markets group at the New York Fed who is now chief market strategist at Macro Insight Group, think they'll go slower with MBS, a smaller market of which the Fed owns a bigger portion. His guess is that the initial cap for MBS will fall anywhere from $2 billion to $6 billion, while the Treasuries cap might be from $4 billion to $10 billion. Question 5: How big will the balance sheet be when they're done? Policy makers have continually stressed that, ultimately, the balance sheet may remain quite large compared to the size that prevailed before the financial crisis. One reason is that the economy has grown since then. Another is that the Fed has changed its operating framework for controlling short-term interest rates out of necessity. Whereas the old framework hinged on keeping central bank reserve balances held by banks scarce in order to control rates, the new system allows them to set rates even as the Fed's bond purchases have bloated reserves in the banking system. Choosing between the two systems could be the difference between shrinking the balance sheet by $1 trillion and $2 trillion, according to JPMorgan's Feroli. So far, almost all signals from the Fed are that they like the post-crisis system. "With almost a year and a half of experience with a federal funds target above the zero lower bound, our current approach has so far proved to be both effective and resilient to structural changes in the market," New York Fed Senior Vice President Lorie Logan, the number-two officer in the reserve bank's markets group, said during a May 18 speech. "The new framework is also quite simple and efficient from an operational perspective." Wall Street dealer banks that trade with Logan's team seem to think that is the way things are headed. In a New York Fed survey conducted in late April, the median respondent of the 23 dealers expected the balance sheet to be $3.1 trillion in size in 2025, with 22 percent of that—or $688 billion—backed by excess reserves.

By JeffReeves Columnist In 2017, many money managers have chased outperformance by overreliance on high-flying tech names. “Hedge funds have 25% net exposure to Tech while large-cap core and growth mutual funds have 22% and 37% allocations, respectively,” noted Goldman Sachs in a note to clients. And no wonder, with picks like Apple AAPL, -0.09%   and Facebook FB, +0.44%   both up over 30% this year through Tuesday morning, while the broader S&P 500, which has a 23.2% weighting in tech, is up a far more modest 8.7%. But will that trend continue over the coming months, particularly after an ominous downgrade to Apple stock this week? And for those of us who aren’t active traders and looking for long-term returns with a diversified portfolio, what the heck is going on in the other 10 market sectors? Here’s a big-picture look at what’s driving the market outside the hot tech stocks: Health care: Up 13% YTD Health-care stocks are the second-biggest share of the S&P 500, making up 13.9% of the index. And while the tech sector’s surge gets the most attention, investors shouldn’t overlook this sector’s outperformance in 2017; the Vanguard Health Care ETF VHT, +0.12% is up 13% year-to-date. While there is still uncertainty about the prospect of health-care reforms in Washington, earnings growth in biotech stocks and the combination of stability and income in the megacaps has kept this sector in favor. Largest components: •Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.10% with $350 billion market capitalization, up 13.7% year to date •Pfizer PFE, +0.14% $190 billion market cap, down 0.7% •Merck & Co. MRK, -0.28% $180 billion market cap, up 10.3% •UnitedHealth Group UNH, -0.01% $170 billion market cap, up 12.4% •Amgen AMGN, +0.25% $120 billion market cap, up 9.9% Financials: Up 0.1% YTD Financials are closely behind health care with a 13.7% weighting in the S&P, but the sector hasn’t delivered consistent returns. After a big run-up after Election Day on the hopes of less regulatory red tape, stumbles with the Republican agenda in Washington have resulted in a 7.2% decline in the Vanguard Financials ETF VFH, +0.40%  since March 1. The sector has now given up almost all of the gains made earlier in the year. Largest components: •Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, +0.00% BRK.B, +0.00% $410 billion market cap, up 2% •J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +0.80% $290 billion market cap, down 4.1% •Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +0.35% $260 billion market cap, down 6.2% •Bank of America BAC, +0.88% $220 billion market cap, up 0.6% •Citigroup C, +0.61% $170 billion market cap, up 2.6% Consumer discretionary: Up 12.1% YTD Another big driver of the market is the consumer discretionary sector, which accounts for 12.5% of the S&P 500. Thanks to hopes of economic growth and tax cuts out of Washington, the sector has notched 12.1% gains in 2017 as measured by the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF VCR, -0.28% While consumer confidence has been softer in recent weeks, it did notch a 16-year high in March to show that spending is very strong in 2017. Largest components: •Amazon.com AMZN, -0.04% $490 billion market cap, up 35.4% •Comcast CMCSA, -0.58% $200 billion market cap, up 21.0% •Home Depot HD, -0.30% $190 billion market cap, up 15.1% •Walt Disney DIS, -0.76% $170 billion market cap, up 1.6% •McDonald’s MCD, +0.02% $130 billion market cap, up 25.1% Industrials: Up 7.0% YTD Making up about 10.2% of the S&P, industrials are a modest driver of market performance. As a group they are hard to pin down given the variety of companies in this sector. General hopes of a recovery have boosted subgroups such as home builders, while aerospace names have benefitted from talks of a bigger Defense Department budget. The net result is a 7.0% gain this year as measured by the Vanguard Industrials ETF VIS, +0.00% Largest components: •General Electric GE, +0.23% $240 billion market cap, down 11.5% •3M MMM, -0.14% $120 billion market cap, up 15.3% •Boeing BA, +0.07% $120 billion market cap, up 21% •Honeywell International HON, -0.02% $100 billion market cap, up 15.0% •United Technologies UTX, -0.21% $100 billion market cap, up 9.6% Consumer staples: Up 9.7% YTD Making up 9.4% of the S&P pie and often seen as sleepy defensive plays, staples don’t get much press in a “risk on” environment. But the sector is up 9.7% year-to-date as measured by the Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF VDC, +0.00% That’s partially because of some hard-fought growth for select names, but also because these stocks remain a haven for investors looking for less risk and bigger yields than they’ll find in the bond market. Top components: •Wal-Mart Stores WMT, +0.71% $240 billion market cap, +14.6% •Procter & Gamble PG, -0.14% $230 billion market cap, up 5.6% •Coca-Cola KO, -0.22% $200 billion market cap, up 10.9% •Philip Morris International PM, -0.77% $190 billion market cap, up 33.3% •PepsiCo PEP, -0.39% $170 billion market cap, up 12.6% Energy: Down 15% YTD One way active managers have tapped into outperformance is by biasing toward the clear gains in tech. Another path is to move away from the clear pain in energy amid weak crude-oil prices CLN7, -0.70%  and flat global demand. The sector doesn’t have the heft of other sectors — it’s just 6.0% of the S&P 500 and has only three components with stock-market capitalizations over $60 billion. But the 15% decline this year, as measured by the Vanguard Energy ETF VDE, +0.23% has depressed the S&P’s overall gain. Largest components: •Exxon Mobil XOM, +0.06% $330 billion market cap, down 10.7% •Chevron CVX, +0.14% $190 billion market cap, down 12.1% •Schlumberger SLB, +0.52% $90 billion market cap, down 17.8% •ConocoPhillips COP, +0.15% $50 billion market cap, down 12.3% •EOG Resources EOG, +0.43% $50 billion market cap, down 11.9% Read: What if Trump kills car-emissions standards after the Paris climate decision? Utilities: Up 10.7% YTD Much like staples, utilities don’t get a lot of love in a bull market but remain highly sought after by investors looking for stable sources of dividends. As a result, the sector is up 10.7% year-to-date as measured by the Vanguard Utilities ETF VPU, -0.45% Bears continue to fret about stretched valuations and the risk of rising interest rates driving money away from utilities and into traditional fixed-income assets, but that clearly hasn’t happened yet this year. Tthe sector is a mere 3.3% of the broader S&P 500 and has no stock over $70 billion in market capitalization. Largest components: •NextEra Energy NEE, -0.51% $70 billion market cap, up 19.0% •Duke Energy DUK, -0.57% $60 billion market cap, up 10.5% •Dominion Energy D, -0.70% $50 billion market cap, up 5.2% •Southern Co. SO, -0.51% $50 billion market cap, up 3.2% •American Electric Power AEP, -0.54% $40 billion market cap, up 15.0% Real estate: Up 0.1% YTD Added as its own sector in 2016, real estate and REITs remain a pretty small sliver of the broader stock market; with only one stock valued at more than $35 billion, real estate makes up just 2.9% of the S&P. Of course, it’s hard to get bigger when interest-rate sensitive REITs are under pressure as the Federal Reserve continues to move toward tighter monetary policy. As rates rise, increasing the cost of borrowing for this capital-intensive sector, investors continue to tread lightly, as seen by the performance of the Vanguard REIT Index Fund VNQ, -0.40% While there are a few winners this year, the sector as a whole remains under pressure. Largest components: •Simon Property Group SPG, -0.41% $50 billion market cap, down 14.4% •Equinix EQIX, -0.33% $30 billion market cap, up 24.9% •Public Storage PSA, -0.32% $40 billion market cap, down 6% •Prologis PLD, -0.62% $30 billion market cap, up 7.1% •AvalonBay Communities AVB, -0.24% $40 billion market cap, up 11.4% Materials: Up 7.3% Given weaker global demand for materials and a strong U.S. dollar holding back commodity prices, materials stocks have been chronic underperformers for the past few years. However, the sector stabilized after Election Day on the hopes of stronger economy that would boost demand for chemicals, base metals and other materials. As a result, the Vanguard Materials ETF VAW, -0.21% is up 7.3% so far this year. The sector is the second-smallest slice of the S&P at a weighting of just 2.8%. Largest components: •Dow Chemical DOW, -0.07% $80 billion market cap, up 10.7% •E.l. DuPont de Nemours DD, +0.00% $70 billion market cap, up 10.1% •Monsanto MON, +0.05% $50 billion market cap, up 11.6% •Praxair PX, -0.59% $40 billion market cap, up 13.9% •Ecolab ECL, -0.30%  , $40 billion market cap, up 13.6% Telecom: Down 4.4% YTD This is the smallest segment of the S&P 500, accounting for just 2.2% of the total and with only about two dozen members. Investors who dig in to the sector will find some struggling behemoths who are watching the old world disrupted by newer (and often lower-margin) communication alternatives. The smaller players have seen a lift in 2017 on hopes of a buyout, but pain at the two top dogs that command over $400 billion in collective stock-market value makes any modest gains by smaller-tier stocks little more than a rounding error in the performance of the broader market. The Vanguard Telecommunication Services ETF VOX, +0.01%  has fallen 4.4% so far this year. Largest components: •AT&T T, -0.03% $240 billion market cap, down 8.9% •Verizon Communications VZ, -0.04% $190 billion market cap, down 12.9% •T-Mobile US TMUS, -0.21% $60 billion market cap, up 17% •Level 3 Communications LVLT, +0.03% $20 billion market cap, up 9.7% •CenturyLink CTL, +0.08% $15 billion market cap, up 8.4% More from MarketWatch AMD’s stock extends surge, fueled by ‘tremendous’ graphics cards demand This is how many drinks a week is bad for your brain U.K. election: The worst, best and most likely scenarios for stocks worldwide Quote References AAPL -0.14 -0.09% FB +0.67 +0.44% VHT +0.17 +0.12% JNJ +0.14 +0.10% PFE +0.05 +0.14% MRK -0.18 -0.28% UNH -0.02 -0.01% AMGN +0.40 +0.25% VFH +0.24 +0.40% BRK.A +0.00 +0.00% BRK.B +0.00 +0.00% JPM +0.68 +0.80% WFC +0.18 +0.35% BAC +0.20 +0.88% C +0.38 +0.61% VCR -0.40 -0.28% AMZN -0.42 -0.04% CMCSA -0.24 -0.58% HD -0.47 -0.30% DIS -0.81 -0.76% MCD +0.03 +0.02% VIS +0.00 +0.00% GE +0.06 +0.23% MMM -0.28 -0.14% BA +0.13 +0.07% HON -0.03 -0.02% UTX -0.25 -0.21% VDC +0.00 +0.00% WMT +0.56 +0.71% PG -0.12 -0.14% KO -0.10 -0.22% PM -0.94 -0.77% PEP -0.46 -0.39% CLN7 -0.32 -0.70% VDE +0.20 +0.23% XOM +0.05 +0.06% CVX +0.15 +0.14% SLB +0.36 +0.52% COP +0.07 +0.15% EOG +0.38 +0.43% VPU -0.53 -0.45% NEE -0.73 -0.51% DUK -0.49 -0.57% D -0.56 -0.70% SO -0.26 -0.51% AEP -0.39 -0.54% VNQ -0.33 -0.40% SPG -0.63 -0.41% EQIX -1.47 -0.33% PSA -0.67 -0.32% PLD -0.35 -0.62% AVB -0.46 -0.24% VAW -0.25 -0.21% DOW -0.04 -0.07% DD +0.00 +0.00% MON +0.06 +0.05% PX -0.78 -0.59% ECL -0.40 -0.30% VOX +0.01 +0.01% T -0.01 -0.03% VZ -0.02 -0.04% TMUS -0.14 -0.21% LVLT +0.02 +0.03% CTL +0.02 +0.08% Show all references Most Popular Why house prices in gay neighborhoods are soaring Stock market set to open slightly higher as ‘Super Thursday’ gets under way Bill Gross warns U.S. market risk is at highest since 2008 crisis Four big events that are prompting investors to sell stocks and buy bonds and gold Women and Alcohol: One Glass a Day Linked to Cancer Data Provided By Today's Interest Rates Mortgage Equity Savings Auto Credit Cards 30 yr fixed Jumbo 4.18% 30 yr fixed 3.75% 15 yr fixed 3.01% 10 yr fixed 2.88% 30 yr fixed refi 3.73% 15 yr fixed refi 3.01% 5/1 ARM 3.14% 5/1 ARM refi 3.24% National averages from Bankrate.com $30K HELOC 4.89% $50K HELOC 4.76% $75K HELOC 4.75% $100K HELOC 4.54% $30K Home Equity Loan 5.23% $50K Home Equity Loan 4.68% $75K Home Equity Loan 4.66% $100K Home Equity Loan 4.89% National averages from Bankrate.com 5 yr CD 1.33% 2 yr CD 0.81% 1 yr CD 0.66% MMA $10K+ 0.3% MMA $50K+ 0.41% MMA Savings 0.34% MMA Savings Jumbo 0.44% National averages from Bankrate.com 60 Mo Used Car 3.57% 48 Mo Used Car 3.5% 36 Mo Used Car 3.61% 72 Mo New Car 3.04% 60 Mo New Car 3.22% 48 Mo New Car 3.07% 60 Mo Auto Refi 2.97% 36 Mo Auto Refi 2.65% National averages from Bankrate.com Avg.

FBI Director James Comey testifies on Trump, Russia talks More | Dismiss America’s CEOs more confident with bets on Trump’s tax reform ADVERTISEMENT On Our Radar Refresh Close On Our Radar Load More America’s CEOs more confident with bets on Trump’s tax reform By Suzanne O'Halloran Published June 06, 2017 Business Leaders FOXBusiness Facebook Twitter Print (Copyright: AP) Days after President Trump took a beating from business leaders over the decision to exit the Paris climate accord, some of those same CEOs are optimistic the president's pro-growth policies on cutting taxes and layers of regulation will pay off for the U.S. economy.  Continue Reading Below CEO confidence is the best it’s been in three-years, as tracked by the Business Roundtable CEO Economic Outlook Index for the 2Q, which compiles projections over the next six months. The index rose to 93.9 up from 93.3 in the first quarter. Executives plan to boost capital spending, and expect sales to rise. While plans to hire saw a slight pullback from the 1Q, the group described the dip as “modest”. This is the second survey since President Trump took office. “We remain optimistic that tax reform is achievable” said JPMorgan Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon (JPM) and Chairman of the Business Roundtable in discussing the survey. Delaying tax reform, he warned, will likely mean CEOs will pull back on capital spending, which drives hiring. More From FOXBusiness.com... U.S. small businesses to lobby Congress to oppose border tax Sen. Ted Cruz: Trump's air traffic control plan is a 'win-win' for Democrats and Republicans Last week, Dimon joined other roundtable members General Electric CEO Jeff Immelt (GE), and Walmart CEO Doug McMillon (WMT), in publically expressing disappointment over the Paris climate decision. Disney CEO Bob Iger (DIS) and Tesla CEO Elon Musk (TSLA), non-members, announced they would defect from the President’s advisory councils after the decision.  Even though Trump’s plans to cut taxes and regulatory red tape by watering down bills including Dodd-Frank remain fluid, the administration is staying on message.     “We’re focused on economic growth, this is about creating jobs, this is about creating economic growth, we’re focused on a middle income tax cut, we’re focused on simplifying taxes and we’re focused on making sure that business taxes are competitive again” said U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin during an interview with FOX Business’ Lou Dobbs last Friday.   Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT CEOs want a “substantially lower corporate tax rate and importantly a shift to a territorial system of taxation,” said Joshua Bolten, Business Roundtable President and CEO, which he said would drive hiring.  Despite ongoing optimism from his cabinet members, CEOs see the economy growing just 2% this year, according to the survey. The latest snapshot of how CEOs feel comes as President Trump kicked-off "infrastructure week," in which he is spreading his message to improve the nation’s airports, roads and bridges. Monday he pledged to overhaul air traffic control with a plan to privatize the system. "The previous administration spent over $7 billion trying to upgrade the system and totally failed.  Honestly, they didn't know what the hell they were doing, a total waste of money, $7 billion plus. It’s time to join the future,” he said during a speech at the White House. Wednesday he is expected to speak along the Ohio River in a push to improve the nation’s inland waterways and dams.

By JeffReeves Columnist In 2017, many money managers have chased outperformance by overreliance on high-flying tech names. “Hedge funds have 25% net exposure to Tech while large-cap core and growth mutual funds have 22% and 37% allocations, respectively,” noted Goldman Sachs in a note to clients. And no wonder, with picks like Apple AAPL, -0.35%   and Facebook FB, +0.28%   both up over 30% this year through Tuesday morning, while the broader S&P 500, which has a 23.2% weighting in tech, is up a far more modest 8.7%. But will that trend continue over the coming months, particularly after an ominous downgrade to Apple stock this week? And for those of us who aren’t active traders and looking for long-term returns with a diversified portfolio, what the heck is going on in the other 10 market sectors? Here’s a big-picture look at what’s driving the market outside the hot tech stocks: Health care: Up 13% YTD Health-care stocks are the second-biggest share of the S&P 500, making up 13.9% of the index. And while the tech sector’s surge gets the most attention, investors shouldn’t overlook this sector’s outperformance in 2017; the Vanguard Health Care ETF VHT, -0.14% is up 13% year-to-date. While there is still uncertainty about the prospect of health-care reforms in Washington, earnings growth in biotech stocks and the combination of stability and income in the megacaps has kept this sector in favor. Largest components: •Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -0.12% with $350 billion market capitalization, up 13.7% year to date •Pfizer PFE, -0.22% $190 billion market cap, down 0.7% •Merck & Co. MRK, -1.31% $180 billion market cap, up 10.3% •UnitedHealth Group UNH, -0.38% $170 billion market cap, up 12.4% •Amgen AMGN, +0.16% $120 billion market cap, up 9.9% Financials: Up 0.1% YTD Financials are closely behind health care with a 13.7% weighting in the S&P, but the sector hasn’t delivered consistent returns. After a big run-up after Election Day on the hopes of less regulatory red tape, stumbles with the Republican agenda in Washington have resulted in a 7.2% decline in the Vanguard Financials ETF VFH, +1.05%  since March 1. The sector has now given up almost all of the gains made earlier in the year. Largest components: •Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, +0.32% BRK.B, +0.36% $410 billion market cap, up 2% •J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +1.69% $290 billion market cap, down 4.1% •Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +0.94% $260 billion market cap, down 6.2% •Bank of America BAC, +2.04% $220 billion market cap, up 0.6% •Citigroup C, +1.85% $170 billion market cap, up 2.6% Consumer discretionary: Up 12.1% YTD Another big driver of the market is the consumer discretionary sector, which accounts for 12.5% of the S&P 500. Thanks to hopes of economic growth and tax cuts out of Washington, the sector has notched 12.1% gains in 2017 as measured by the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF VCR, -0.25% While consumer confidence has been softer in recent weeks, it did notch a 16-year high in March to show that spending is very strong in 2017. Largest components: •Amazon.com AMZN, -0.16% $490 billion market cap, up 35.4% •Comcast CMCSA, -1.43% $200 billion market cap, up 21.0% •Home Depot HD, -0.37% $190 billion market cap, up 15.1% •Walt Disney DIS, -0.88% $170 billion market cap, up 1.6% •McDonald’s MCD, -0.20% $130 billion market cap, up 25.1% Industrials: Up 7.0% YTD Making up about 10.2% of the S&P, industrials are a modest driver of market performance. As a group they are hard to pin down given the variety of companies in this sector. General hopes of a recovery have boosted subgroups such as home builders, while aerospace names have benefitted from talks of a bigger Defense Department budget. The net result is a 7.0% gain this year as measured by the Vanguard Industrials ETF VIS, -0.03% Largest components: •General Electric GE, +0.14% $240 billion market cap, down 11.5% •3M MMM, -0.26% $120 billion market cap, up 15.3% •Boeing BA, +0.45% $120 billion market cap, up 21% •Honeywell International HON, -0.20% $100 billion market cap, up 15.0% •United Technologies UTX, -0.46% $100 billion market cap, up 9.6% Consumer staples: Up 9.7% YTD Making up 9.4% of the S&P pie and often seen as sleepy defensive plays, staples don’t get much press in a “risk on” environment. But the sector is up 9.7% year-to-date as measured by the Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF VDC, -0.54% That’s partially because of some hard-fought growth for select names, but also because these stocks remain a haven for investors looking for less risk and bigger yields than they’ll find in the bond market. Top components: •Wal-Mart Stores WMT, +0.33% $240 billion market cap, +14.6% •Procter & Gamble PG, -0.54% $230 billion market cap, up 5.6% •Coca-Cola KO, -0.54% $200 billion market cap, up 10.9% •Philip Morris International PM, -1.02% $190 billion market cap, up 33.3% •PepsiCo PEP, -0.72% $170 billion market cap, up 12.6% Energy: Down 15% YTD One way active managers have tapped into outperformance is by biasing toward the clear gains in tech. Another path is to move away from the clear pain in energy amid weak crude-oil prices CLN7, +0.04%  and flat global demand. The sector doesn’t have the heft of other sectors — it’s just 6.0% of the S&P 500 and has only three components with stock-market capitalizations over $60 billion. But the 15% decline this year, as measured by the Vanguard Energy ETF VDE, +0.10% has depressed the S&P’s overall gain. Largest components: •Exxon Mobil XOM, -0.06% $330 billion market cap, down 10.7% •Chevron CVX, +0.29% $190 billion market cap, down 12.1% •Schlumberger SLB, +0.44% $90 billion market cap, down 17.8% •ConocoPhillips COP, +0.07% $50 billion market cap, down 12.3% •EOG Resources EOG, +0.14% $50 billion market cap, down 11.9% Read: What if Trump kills car-emissions standards after the Paris climate decision? Utilities: Up 10.7% YTD Much like staples, utilities don’t get a lot of love in a bull market but remain highly sought after by investors looking for stable sources of dividends. As a result, the sector is up 10.7% year-to-date as measured by the Vanguard Utilities ETF VPU, -0.78% Bears continue to fret about stretched valuations and the risk of rising interest rates driving money away from utilities and into traditional fixed-income assets, but that clearly hasn’t happened yet this year. Tthe sector is a mere 3.3% of the broader S&P 500 and has no stock over $70 billion in market capitalization. Largest components: •NextEra Energy NEE, -0.92% $70 billion market cap, up 19.0% •Duke Energy DUK, -0.82% $60 billion market cap, up 10.5% •Dominion Energy D, -1.06% $50 billion market cap, up 5.2% •Southern Co. SO, -0.74% $50 billion market cap, up 3.2% •American Electric Power AEP, -0.67% $40 billion market cap, up 15.0% Real estate: Up 0.1% YTD Added as its own sector in 2016, real estate and REITs remain a pretty small sliver of the broader stock market; with only one stock valued at more than $35 billion, real estate makes up just 2.9% of the S&P. Of course, it’s hard to get bigger when interest-rate sensitive REITs are under pressure as the Federal Reserve continues to move toward tighter monetary policy. As rates rise, increasing the cost of borrowing for this capital-intensive sector, investors continue to tread lightly, as seen by the performance of the Vanguard REIT Index Fund VNQ, -0.80% While there are a few winners this year, the sector as a whole remains under pressure. Largest components: •Simon Property Group SPG, -0.29% $50 billion market cap, down 14.4% •Equinix EQIX, -0.83% $30 billion market cap, up 24.9% •Public Storage PSA, -0.39% $40 billion market cap, down 6% •Prologis PLD, -1.44% $30 billion market cap, up 7.1% •AvalonBay Communities AVB, -0.93% $40 billion market cap, up 11.4% Materials: Up 7.3% Given weaker global demand for materials and a strong U.S. dollar holding back commodity prices, materials stocks have been chronic underperformers for the past few years. However, the sector stabilized after Election Day on the hopes of stronger economy that would boost demand for chemicals, base metals and other materials. As a result, the Vanguard Materials ETF VAW, -0.16% is up 7.3% so far this year. The sector is the second-smallest slice of the S&P at a weighting of just 2.8%. Largest components: •Dow Chemical DOW, -0.11% $80 billion market cap, up 10.7% •E.l. DuPont de Nemours DD, -0.04% $70 billion market cap, up 10.1% •Monsanto MON, -0.04% $50 billion market cap, up 11.6% •Praxair PX, -0.89% $40 billion market cap, up 13.9% •Ecolab ECL, -0.59%  , $40 billion market cap, up 13.6% Telecom: Down 4.4% YTD This is the smallest segment of the S&P 500, accounting for just 2.2% of the total and with only about two dozen members. Investors who dig in to the sector will find some struggling behemoths who are watching the old world disrupted by newer (and often lower-margin) communication alternatives. The smaller players have seen a lift in 2017 on hopes of a buyout, but pain at the two top dogs that command over $400 billion in collective stock-market value makes any modest gains by smaller-tier stocks little more than a rounding error in the performance of the broader market. The Vanguard Telecommunication Services ETF VOX, +0.12%  has fallen 4.4% so far this year. Largest components: •AT&T T, -0.22% $240 billion market cap, down 8.9% •Verizon Communications VZ, -0.23% $190 billion market cap, down 12.9% •T-Mobile US TMUS, -0.44% $60 billion market cap, up 17% •Level 3 Communications LVLT, +0.39% $20 billion market cap, up 9.7% •CenturyLink CTL, +0.54% $15 billion market cap, up 8.4% More from MarketWatch U.S. oil data shocks the market in more ways than one 3 reasons why this couple is ignoring their 401(k) accounts in early retirement Four big events that are prompting investors to sell stocks and buy bonds and gold Quote References AAPL -0.55 -0.35% FB +0.43 +0.28% VHT -0.20 -0.14% JNJ -0.16 -0.12% PFE -0.07 -0.22% MRK -0.84 -1.31% UNH -0.69 -0.38% AMGN +0.26 +0.16% VFH +0.63 +1.05% BRK.A +808.00 +0.32% BRK.B +0.61 +0.36% JPM +1.42 +1.69% WFC +0.49 +0.94% BAC +0.46 +2.04% C +1.15 +1.85% VCR -0.36 -0.25% AMZN -1.58 -0.16% CMCSA -0.60 -1.43% HD -0.58 -0.37% DIS -0.93 -0.88% MCD -0.31 -0.20% VIS -0.04 -0.03% GE +0.04 +0.14% MMM -0.54 -0.26% BA +0.84 +0.45% HON -0.27 -0.20% UTX -0.55 -0.46% VDC -0.79 -0.54% WMT +0.27 +0.33% PG -0.48 -0.54% KO -0.24 -0.54% PM -1.25 -1.02% PEP -0.84 -0.72% CLN7 +0.02 +0.04% VDE +0.09 +0.10% XOM -0.05 -0.06% CVX +0.30 +0.29% SLB +0.30 +0.44% COP +0.03 +0.07% EOG +0.12 +0.14% VPU -0.92 -0.78% NEE -1.31 -0.92% DUK -0.71 -0.82% D -0.85 -1.06% SO -0.38 -0.74% AEP -0.49 -0.67% VNQ -0.67 -0.80% SPG -0.45 -0.29% EQIX -3.66 -0.83% PSA -0.81 -0.39% PLD -0.82 -1.44% AVB -1.81 -0.93% VAW -0.20 -0.16% DOW -0.07 -0.11% DD -0.03 -0.04% MON -0.05 -0.04% PX -1.19 -0.89% ECL -0.79 -0.59% VOX +0.12 +0.12% T -0.08 -0.22% VZ -0.10 -0.23% TMUS -0.29 -0.44% LVLT +0.24 +0.39% CTL +0.14 +0.54% Show all references Most Popular Why house prices in gay neighborhoods are soaring Stock market set to open slightly higher as ‘Super Thursday’ gets under way Bill Gross warns U.S. market risk is at highest since 2008 crisis Four big events that are prompting investors to sell stocks and buy bonds and gold Women and Alcohol: One Glass a Day Linked to Cancer Data Provided By Today's Interest Rates Mortgage Equity Savings Auto Credit Cards 30 yr fixed Jumbo 4.18% 30 yr fixed 3.75% 15 yr fixed 3.01% 10 yr fixed 2.88% 30 yr fixed refi 3.73% 15 yr fixed refi 3.01% 5/1 ARM 3.14% 5/1 ARM refi 3.24% National averages from Bankrate.com $30K HELOC 4.89% $50K HELOC 4.76% $75K HELOC 4.75% $100K HELOC 4.54% $30K Home Equity Loan 5.23% $50K Home Equity Loan 4.68% $75K Home Equity Loan 4.66% $100K Home Equity Loan 4.89% National averages from Bankrate.com 5 yr CD 1.33% 2 yr CD 0.81% 1 yr CD 0.66% MMA $10K+ 0.3% MMA $50K+ 0.41% MMA Savings 0.34% MMA Savings Jumbo 0.44% National averages from Bankrate.com 60 Mo Used Car 3.57% 48 Mo Used Car 3.5% 36 Mo Used Car 3.61% 72 Mo New Car 3.04% 60 Mo New Car 3.22% 48 Mo New Car 3.07% 60 Mo Auto Refi 2.97% 36 Mo Auto Refi 2.65% National averages from Bankrate.com Avg.

By JeffReeves Columnist In 2017, many money managers have chased outperformance by overreliance on high-flying tech names. “Hedge funds have 25% net exposure to Tech while large-cap core and growth mutual funds have 22% and 37% allocations, respectively,” noted Goldman Sachs in a note to clients. And no wonder, with picks like Apple AAPL, -0.34%   and Facebook FB, +0.29%   both up over 30% this year through Tuesday morning, while the broader S&P 500, which has a 23.2% weighting in tech, is up a far more modest 8.7%. But will that trend continue over the coming months, particularly after an ominous downgrade to Apple stock this week? And for those of us who aren’t active traders and looking for long-term returns with a diversified portfolio, what the heck is going on in the other 10 market sectors? Here’s a big-picture look at what’s driving the market outside the hot tech stocks: Health care: Up 13% YTD Health-care stocks are the second-biggest share of the S&P 500, making up 13.9% of the index. And while the tech sector’s surge gets the most attention, investors shouldn’t overlook this sector’s outperformance in 2017; the Vanguard Health Care ETF VHT, -0.14% is up 13% year-to-date. While there is still uncertainty about the prospect of health-care reforms in Washington, earnings growth in biotech stocks and the combination of stability and income in the megacaps has kept this sector in favor. Largest components: •Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -0.11% with $350 billion market capitalization, up 13.7% year to date •Pfizer PFE, -0.23% $190 billion market cap, down 0.7% •Merck & Co. MRK, -1.26% $180 billion market cap, up 10.3% •UnitedHealth Group UNH, -0.37% $170 billion market cap, up 12.4% •Amgen AMGN, +0.16% $120 billion market cap, up 9.9% Financials: Up 0.1% YTD Financials are closely behind health care with a 13.7% weighting in the S&P, but the sector hasn’t delivered consistent returns. After a big run-up after Election Day on the hopes of less regulatory red tape, stumbles with the Republican agenda in Washington have resulted in a 7.2% decline in the Vanguard Financials ETF VFH, +1.05%  since March 1. The sector has now given up almost all of the gains made earlier in the year. Largest components: •Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, +0.54% BRK.B, +0.42% $410 billion market cap, up 2% •J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +1.64% $290 billion market cap, down 4.1% •Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +0.94% $260 billion market cap, down 6.2% •Bank of America BAC, +2.01% $220 billion market cap, up 0.6% •Citigroup C, +1.86% $170 billion market cap, up 2.6% Consumer discretionary: Up 12.1% YTD Another big driver of the market is the consumer discretionary sector, which accounts for 12.5% of the S&P 500. Thanks to hopes of economic growth and tax cuts out of Washington, the sector has notched 12.1% gains in 2017 as measured by the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF VCR, -0.25% While consumer confidence has been softer in recent weeks, it did notch a 16-year high in March to show that spending is very strong in 2017. Largest components: •Amazon.com AMZN, -0.17% $490 billion market cap, up 35.4% •Comcast CMCSA, -1.42% $200 billion market cap, up 21.0% •Home Depot HD, -0.38% $190 billion market cap, up 15.1% •Walt Disney DIS, -0.82% $170 billion market cap, up 1.6% •McDonald’s MCD, -0.21% $130 billion market cap, up 25.1% Industrials: Up 7.0% YTD Making up about 10.2% of the S&P, industrials are a modest driver of market performance. As a group they are hard to pin down given the variety of companies in this sector. General hopes of a recovery have boosted subgroups such as home builders, while aerospace names have benefitted from talks of a bigger Defense Department budget. The net result is a 7.0% gain this year as measured by the Vanguard Industrials ETF VIS, -0.03% Largest components: •General Electric GE, +0.14% $240 billion market cap, down 11.5% •3M MMM, -0.29% $120 billion market cap, up 15.3% •Boeing BA, +0.43% $120 billion market cap, up 21% •Honeywell International HON, -0.20% $100 billion market cap, up 15.0% •United Technologies UTX, -0.46% $100 billion market cap, up 9.6% Consumer staples: Up 9.7% YTD Making up 9.4% of the S&P pie and often seen as sleepy defensive plays, staples don’t get much press in a “risk on” environment. But the sector is up 9.7% year-to-date as measured by the Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF VDC, -0.48% That’s partially because of some hard-fought growth for select names, but also because these stocks remain a haven for investors looking for less risk and bigger yields than they’ll find in the bond market. Top components: •Wal-Mart Stores WMT, +0.32% $240 billion market cap, +14.6% •Procter & Gamble PG, -0.55% $230 billion market cap, up 5.6% •Coca-Cola KO, -0.54% $200 billion market cap, up 10.9% •Philip Morris International PM, -1.03% $190 billion market cap, up 33.3% •PepsiCo PEP, -0.76% $170 billion market cap, up 12.6% Energy: Down 15% YTD One way active managers have tapped into outperformance is by biasing toward the clear gains in tech. Another path is to move away from the clear pain in energy amid weak crude-oil prices CLN7, +0.00%  and flat global demand. The sector doesn’t have the heft of other sectors — it’s just 6.0% of the S&P 500 and has only three components with stock-market capitalizations over $60 billion. But the 15% decline this year, as measured by the Vanguard Energy ETF VDE, +0.10% has depressed the S&P’s overall gain. Largest components: •Exxon Mobil XOM, -0.09% $330 billion market cap, down 10.7% •Chevron CVX, +0.25% $190 billion market cap, down 12.1% •Schlumberger SLB, +0.42% $90 billion market cap, down 17.8% •ConocoPhillips COP, -0.02% $50 billion market cap, down 12.3% •EOG Resources EOG, +0.15% $50 billion market cap, down 11.9% Read: What if Trump kills car-emissions standards after the Paris climate decision? Utilities: Up 10.7% YTD Much like staples, utilities don’t get a lot of love in a bull market but remain highly sought after by investors looking for stable sources of dividends. As a result, the sector is up 10.7% year-to-date as measured by the Vanguard Utilities ETF VPU, -0.78% Bears continue to fret about stretched valuations and the risk of rising interest rates driving money away from utilities and into traditional fixed-income assets, but that clearly hasn’t happened yet this year. Tthe sector is a mere 3.3% of the broader S&P 500 and has no stock over $70 billion in market capitalization. Largest components: •NextEra Energy NEE, -0.93% $70 billion market cap, up 19.0% •Duke Energy DUK, -0.82% $60 billion market cap, up 10.5% •Dominion Energy D, -1.07% $50 billion market cap, up 5.2% •Southern Co. SO, -0.78% $50 billion market cap, up 3.2% •American Electric Power AEP, -0.67% $40 billion market cap, up 15.0% Real estate: Up 0.1% YTD Added as its own sector in 2016, real estate and REITs remain a pretty small sliver of the broader stock market; with only one stock valued at more than $35 billion, real estate makes up just 2.9% of the S&P. Of course, it’s hard to get bigger when interest-rate sensitive REITs are under pressure as the Federal Reserve continues to move toward tighter monetary policy. As rates rise, increasing the cost of borrowing for this capital-intensive sector, investors continue to tread lightly, as seen by the performance of the Vanguard REIT Index Fund VNQ, -0.84% While there are a few winners this year, the sector as a whole remains under pressure. Largest components: •Simon Property Group SPG, -0.28% $50 billion market cap, down 14.4% •Equinix EQIX, -0.83% $30 billion market cap, up 24.9% •Public Storage PSA, -0.39% $40 billion market cap, down 6% •Prologis PLD, -1.51% $30 billion market cap, up 7.1% •AvalonBay Communities AVB, -0.93% $40 billion market cap, up 11.4% Materials: Up 7.3% Given weaker global demand for materials and a strong U.S. dollar holding back commodity prices, materials stocks have been chronic underperformers for the past few years. However, the sector stabilized after Election Day on the hopes of stronger economy that would boost demand for chemicals, base metals and other materials. As a result, the Vanguard Materials ETF VAW, -0.16% is up 7.3% so far this year. The sector is the second-smallest slice of the S&P at a weighting of just 2.8%. Largest components: •Dow Chemical DOW, -0.11% $80 billion market cap, up 10.7% •E.l. DuPont de Nemours DD, +0.01% $70 billion market cap, up 10.1% •Monsanto MON, -0.04% $50 billion market cap, up 11.6% •Praxair PX, -0.98% $40 billion market cap, up 13.9% •Ecolab ECL, -0.59%  , $40 billion market cap, up 13.6% Telecom: Down 4.4% YTD This is the smallest segment of the S&P 500, accounting for just 2.2% of the total and with only about two dozen members. Investors who dig in to the sector will find some struggling behemoths who are watching the old world disrupted by newer (and often lower-margin) communication alternatives. The smaller players have seen a lift in 2017 on hopes of a buyout, but pain at the two top dogs that command over $400 billion in collective stock-market value makes any modest gains by smaller-tier stocks little more than a rounding error in the performance of the broader market. The Vanguard Telecommunication Services ETF VOX, +0.12%  has fallen 4.4% so far this year. Largest components: •AT&T T, -0.22% $240 billion market cap, down 8.9% •Verizon Communications VZ, -0.24% $190 billion market cap, down 12.9% •T-Mobile US TMUS, -0.44% $60 billion market cap, up 17% •Level 3 Communications LVLT, +0.26% $20 billion market cap, up 9.7% •CenturyLink CTL, +0.43% $15 billion market cap, up 8.4% More from MarketWatch Nasdaq sets intraday record, but stocks cough up early rise ahead of Comey testimony Why house prices in gay neighborhoods are soaring U.S. oil data shocks the market in more ways than one Quote References AAPL -0.53 -0.34% FB +0.44 +0.29% VHT -0.20 -0.14% JNJ -0.14 -0.11% PFE -0.07 -0.23% MRK -0.80 -1.26% UNH -0.67 -0.37% AMGN +0.26 +0.16% VFH +0.63 +1.05% BRK.A +1,359.00 +0.54% BRK.B +0.70 +0.42% JPM +1.38 +1.64% WFC +0.49 +0.94% BAC +0.46 +2.01% C +1.15 +1.86% VCR -0.36 -0.25% AMZN -1.68 -0.17% CMCSA -0.59 -1.42% HD -0.59 -0.38% DIS -0.87 -0.82% MCD -0.31 -0.21% VIS -0.04 -0.03% GE +0.04 +0.14% MMM -0.59 -0.29% BA +0.80 +0.43% HON -0.27 -0.20% UTX -0.56 -0.46% VDC -0.70 -0.48% WMT +0.25 +0.32% PG -0.49 -0.55% KO -0.24 -0.54% PM -1.26 -1.03% PEP -0.89 -0.76% CLN7 +0.00 +0.00% VDE +0.09 +0.10% XOM -0.07 -0.09% CVX +0.26 +0.25% SLB +0.29 +0.42% COP -0.01 -0.02% EOG +0.13 +0.15% VPU -0.92 -0.78% NEE -1.33 -0.93% DUK -0.71 -0.82% D -0.86 -1.07% SO -0.40 -0.78% AEP -0.49 -0.67% VNQ -0.70 -0.84% SPG -0.44 -0.28% EQIX -3.66 -0.83% PSA -0.82 -0.39% PLD -0.85 -1.51% AVB -1.81 -0.93% VAW -0.20 -0.16% DOW -0.07 -0.11% DD +0.01 +0.01% MON -0.05 -0.04% PX -1.30 -0.98% ECL -0.79 -0.59% VOX +0.12 +0.12% T -0.08 -0.22% VZ -0.11 -0.24% TMUS -0.29 -0.44% LVLT +0.16 +0.26% CTL +0.11 +0.43% Show all references Most Popular Why house prices in gay neighborhoods are soaring Stock market set to open slightly higher as ‘Super Thursday’ gets under way Bill Gross warns U.S. market risk is at highest since 2008 crisis Four big events that are prompting investors to sell stocks and buy bonds and gold Women and Alcohol: One Glass a Day Linked to Cancer Data Provided By Today's Interest Rates Mortgage Equity Savings Auto Credit Cards 30 yr fixed Jumbo 4.18% 30 yr fixed 3.75% 15 yr fixed 3.01% 10 yr fixed 2.88% 30 yr fixed refi 3.73% 15 yr fixed refi 3.01% 5/1 ARM 3.14% 5/1 ARM refi 3.24% National averages from Bankrate.com $30K HELOC 4.89% $50K HELOC 4.76% $75K HELOC 4.75% $100K HELOC 4.54% $30K Home Equity Loan 5.23% $50K Home Equity Loan 4.68% $75K Home Equity Loan 4.66% $100K Home Equity Loan 4.89% National averages from Bankrate.com 5 yr CD 1.33% 2 yr CD 0.81% 1 yr CD 0.66% MMA $10K+ 0.3% MMA $50K+ 0.41% MMA Savings 0.34% MMA Savings Jumbo 0.44% National averages from Bankrate.com 60 Mo Used Car 3.57% 48 Mo Used Car 3.5% 36 Mo Used Car 3.61% 72 Mo New Car 3.04% 60 Mo New Car 3.22% 48 Mo New Car 3.07% 60 Mo Auto Refi 2.97% 36 Mo Auto Refi 2.65% National averages from Bankrate.com Avg.

Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon says business leaders are optimistic that tax reform will help improve the U.S. economy. The CEOs of America’s largest companies are the most optimistic about the U.S. economy in three years. But if tax reform fails to pass in Congress, all bets are off. Business Roundtable The Business Roundtable said an index that measures the confidence of the nation’s top executives rose in the second quarter to the highest level since 2014. The CEO economic outlook index increased to 93.9 from 93.3. Chief executives are especially hopeful the Trump White House will reform an outdated corporate tax code that they say hinders business and encourages them to shift operations outside the U.S. “The urgency for tax reform cannot be overstated,” said Jamie Dimon, the head of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +1.68%   and current chairman of the roundtable. He said half or more of the group’s member said they would scale back investment and hiring unless tax reform takes place. The increase in CEO optimism, however, might not translate into much faster investment and hiring in the rest of the year. Also read: U.S. job openings hit record high even as hiring slips Some 36% of the CEOs surveyed, for example, said they plan to hire in the next six months, down from 41% in the prior quarter. Still, more companies say they are willing to hire — or at least don’t plan to cut workers — since Donald Trump got elected. Meanwhile, 43% said they plan to increase investment, a touch lower than the 46% who said so in the first quarter. That’s still sharply higher vs one year ago, however. The cautious optimism of CEOs is reflected in their more pessimistic new forecast for the U.S. economy. The roundtable now estimates gross domestic product will grow 2% in 2017 vs the prior 2.2% target. In 2016, the U.S. expanded at a 1.6% pace. Even if tax reform passes, economists say the biggest benefits are unlikely to be felt until 2018 at the earliest. Nearly 150 CEOs took part in the survey. Collectively they employ around 15 million people.

Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. “Arrived in China, as always impressed by condition of airport, roads, cell service, etc.,” the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO said in a tweet Tuesday. “U.S. needs to invest in infrastructure to keep up!” Blankfein’s message -- his third-ever tweet -- echoed remarks from Dimon, who said the neglect damages economic growth. “I just came from Hong Kong -- I mean, it’s embarrassing,” Dimon said in a Bloomberg Television interview Monday in Beijing. “America, the can-do nation, should get back to building and constructing.” President Donald Trump has proposed leveraging $200 billion to generate a total of about $1 trillion from states, cities and private investors to rebuild America’s roads, bridges, airports and other infrastructure. Gary Cohn, the former Goldman Sachs executive who now leads Trump’s National Economic Council, has said the strategy can deliver substantial gains without new taxes. The American Society of Civil Engineers has estimated about $2 trillion in new funds is needed to do the job properly. Congressional Democrats have said they won’t support any plan that relies on tax breaks for wealthy investors, arguing that much more direct spending by Washington is needed.

CEOs remain in the belief that the changes eventually will take hold. Indexes for investment and sales both rose, though hiring dipped. Jeff Cox | @JeffCoxCNBCcom Tuesday, 6 Jun 2017 | 10:30 AM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Fragile recovery for global economy ahead: World Bank    Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 11:45 PM ET | 01:27 Corporate executives' confidence has hit a three-year high even as their hopes for economic growth and job creation have dimmed, according to a survey released Tuesday. The latest Business Roundtable CEO Economic Outlook Index hit its highest level since the second quarter of 2014 as belief grew that pro-growth policies out of the Trump administration would yield long-term benefits. That came even though the executives see GDP growth of just 2 percent in 2017, down from 2.2 percent in March. "The survey results reflect confidence from America's leading employers in the prospects for tax reform, as well as the tangible economic benefits that tax reform will produce," said Business Roundtable Chairman Jamie Dimon said in a statement. "CEOs are also responding to the administration's commitment to creating a more favorable regulatory environment, protecting the safety and health of our citizens while also protecting jobs," added Dimon, who is CEO of JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank by assets in the U.S. The rising confidence comes amid a volatile backdrop. President Donald Trump's plans to cut taxes, lower regulatory barriers and increase infrastructure spending have been slow to launch since he took office in January. While the administration has been caught up in a thus-far unsuccessful fight to replace Obamacare, the broader economy has struggled. GDP rose just 1.2 percent in the first quarter and the past three months have seen lackluster employment gains. However, CEOs remain of the belief that the changes eventually will take hold. Indexes for investment and sales both rose, though hiring dipped. "Business leaders remain confident that Congress and the administration will enact tax reform because the cost of inaction for America's businesses and workers is too great," Joshua Bolten, Business Roundtable president and CEO, added in a statement. The roundtable's index for sales rose modestly, from 123.8 in the first quarter to 124.3. Capital spending gained from 82.6 to 87.2, while employment edged lower from 73.6 to 70.3. The survey has been taken since the fourth quarter of 2002 and is designed to reflect sentiment from corporate leaders regarding general confidence and specifically confidence in investment, employment gains and sales. Economic numbers lately have been mixed. Friday's nonfarm payrolls report showed job creation dipped to 138,000 in May, well below consensus expectations. On Monday, the closely watched ISM nonmanufacturing index registered a 56.9 reading, which represented growth but came in below market expectations. Broadly speaking, economic data have been missing estimates by a fairly wide margin. The Citi Economic Surprise Index, which measures numbers against expectations, is around its lowest level since February 2016.

Discover What the World Thinks of U.S. Home Our Team Volunteers Wanted Foreign News Sources Archives About About Us In the Media Donate Elon Musk (Also) Abandons Trump Donald Trump Elon Musk Italy Paris Climate Agreement Strategic and Policy Forum Published in Il Giornale (Italy) on 3 June 2017 by Guido Dell'Omo [link to original] Translated from Italian by Marie Winnick. Edited by Pam Willey. Posted on June 6, 2017. This Wednesday, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, Elon Musk, published a series of tweets. In these, he abandoned his role as an adviser to the group formed by Trump, which has the aim of assisting him with economic strategy dossiers and which also includes CEOs of companies such as JPMorgan Chase & Company, The Walt Disney Company and IBM. The world-famous entrepreneur’s tweets are a clear attempt to dissuade the American president from continuing with the policy pursued so far against climate change. Donald Trump recently said on several occasions that he is not going to comply with the Paris Climate Agreement, intended to try to control environmental damage by setting a ceiling on emissions produced by each country. For a man like Musk, who built his fortune on electric cars, it would have been impossible to stay silent on a relevant issue such as that posed by the dangers of climate change. Musk is one of the 18 businessmen called by the president at the beginning of his term to be part of the new administration’s business council, called the Strategic and Policy Forum. But the founding father of the masterpiece that is SpaceX, having just finished a $1.6 billion contract with NASA to send supplies to the International Space Station, is also one of Trump’s key men for his project on work-related reform in America, one of the most important issues for "The Donald" since the election campaign. Musk was already on a collision course with Trump when the president set up the much-discussed “travel ban” that prohibited entry into the United States for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries that Trump considered to be sources of danger. This time, however, Musk has no intention of accepting the U.S. president’s decision. And despite being expressed through tweets, the message sent to the U.S. president should not be underestimated. Namely, “If you decide to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, I will leave my advisory role.” The U.S.-naturalized South African businessman is not a man of politics, and facts usually follow his words; in protest, he has already missed the last two meetings of the strategic council that he belongs to. Musk has been heavily criticized by the media for agreeing to join Trump's team, but this never worried him, because he was aware of how much his contribution could have meant for the good of the community – not just in America but globally. He said it himself. His threat should therefore not be seen as a personal attack on Trump, but rather as an attempt to bring the president back to the straight and narrow on a subject of such importance as that of climate change, which is inexorably changing life on our planet. Musk is not only one of the world's most famous business people, but is also one of the few who enjoys respect from citizens, not only in the United States but also in Europe. If he were to abandon Trump’s advisory council, it would be a hard blow to the image of the White House resident, which has already been put to the test. It wouldn’t be just a blow to him as a president, but also as a credible businessman. *Editor’s note: This Twitter quote, accurately translated, could not be verified. Instead the following tweet from Elon Musk was found in multiple sources, “Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case,” responding to the question “What will you do if he decides to leave?” referring to Trump leaving the Paris Agreement.

The information you need to start your day, including top headlines from PaymentsSource and around the Web: Location, Location, Location: Snapchat has sometimes dabbled in payments and commerce, such as building its SnapCash P-to-P system on top of Square's technology back in 2014, and it is reportedly taking a deeper dive by acquiring a location analytics platform. SnapChat has spent more than $200 million to buy Placed, a Seattle-based startup with more than 100 employees, according to GeekWire. Placed tracks consumer behavior to determine how advertising spend translates to in-store sales and how Amazon "showrooming" affects brick-and-mortar shopping; by joining SnapChat, Placed's location technology can enhance the new Snap to Store tool, which serves a similar purpose of tracking ad campaign effectiveness at physical retail stores, the article states. Snapchat's ghost logos Bloomberg News Apple's buried news: Apple drew a lot of attention at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference by announcing P-to-P payments and other upgrades, but a few upgrades didn't make it into the company's hours-long presentation. For example, Apple is finally adding support for QR codes on iOS devices, according to The Verge, which suspects QR code reading will be built into the default iOS camera app. QR codes are used by many mobile wallet apps (but not Apple Pay); though considered an older technology, QR is used prominently in several recently developed mobile payment and loyalty efforts from JPMorgan Chase, Alipay and Facebook. Amazon's big push on the small screen: Amazon has already embedded its payments technology into everything from video-enhanced versions of its Echo speakers to major appliances, and yet there still seems to be more turf for it to take over. The e-commerce giant's latest move takes it to more TV screens, with an Amazon Fire TV app that lets viewers browse items from Amazon's website, TechCrunch reports. Oddly, the Fire TV app isn't as feature-rich as the Apple TV version that Amazon published in December, the article notes; voice search on the Fire TV version is limited to digital content, whereas the Apple TV version allows full search via Siri. Metadata matters: Encryption is vital to protecting sensitive personal and corporate data, however it can also present an obstacle to law enforcement investigations. But encryption isn't everything, according to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Encryption "doesn’t mean no information. Metadata exists and that’s very important for building a profile," Cook told Bloomberg News, explaining how Apple was able to aid U.K. law enforcement agencies without compromising Apple's own security standards following the recent string of terror attacks. Apple has previously pushed back against law enforcement requests to weaken or bypass its encryption, and this new development doesn't indicate a change in policy, Cook added. "In cases when we have information and they have gone through the lawful process we don’t just give it but we do it very promptly," Cook told Bloomberg News. Apple's security came under its harshest scrutiny back in 2014, just ahead of the launch of Apple Pay, when its iCloud service was implicated in a massive leak of intimate photos of Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton and other celebrities. From the Web Alibaba’s Fight for Data The Wall Street Journal | Mon Jun 5, 2017 - The e-commerce giant’s recent flap with a big delivery company points to its insatiable need for customer information. Why our credit cards keep getting hacked USA Today | Mon Jun 5, 2017 - Time and money, say experts. It takes time for companies to rebuild point of sale systems more securely and shift from magnetic stripe credit and debit cards to more secure chip cards. They need money to hire tech staff to secure those networks, money to buy software to do the securing and money to buy new, encrypted point-of-sale machines. The Durbin amendment: The ultimate double whammy The Hill | Mon Jun 5, 2017 - The Financial CHOICE Act, which begins to untangle the web of harmful rules that Dodd Frank put in place, is likely to pass the House this week. That’s very good news for community banks and credit unions, but it doesn’t mean Congress’s work on financial reform is done. More from PaymentsSource Two providers craft a single API for cross-border payments Amidst all of the complexities that e-commerce businesses have in completing or accepting cross-border payments, PayU says the application programming interface (API) can make the biggest difference.

Audits and advanced regulatory technology can help companies keep up, writes Performline CEO Alex Baydin. Apple makes iMessage the heart of its P-to-P strategy Apple formally announced the debut of its rumored Venmo-like P-to-P service, and as with anything Apple-related, it's deeply embedded into the overall Apple ecosystem. Walmart’s Seinfeld-esque scheme to battle Amazon Walmart is piloting a delivery program that leverages its store staff as delivery drivers in a decidedly manual response to the digital threat of Amazon.com. And it just might work.

Photographer: Todd Heisler/The New York Times The Federal Reserve is getting ready to "normalize" the size of its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. A lot is at stake. Simply maintaining that over-sized stack of bonds makes the Fed a big player in the markets for Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. Investors and traders are anxious for information about how the central bank intends to pull back. "There are so many different parameters by which they could set this process," said Tom Simons, a senior economist at Jefferies in New York. "There's a wide range of market implications as a result for what the public supply of Treasuries is going to be and how liquid the MBS market is going to be." At the moment, when a bond in that portfolio matures or gets paid back early, the Fed reinvests the returned principal. To shrink the balance sheet, all the Fed has to do is stop reinvesting. But the idea of halting that process all at once makes the Fed nervous about possibly disrupting markets. Stopping now would shrink the portfolio by about $280 billion over the last seven months of 2017, and by about $650 billion in 2018, according to Walter Schmidt, the Chicago-based senior vice president at FTN Financial, and data from The Yield Book. At their May meeting, policymakers backed a plan to reduce each month's reinvestments by a set, and as-yet undecided, dollar amount. That sum will roll off the balance sheet and any maturities above the cap will be plowed back into the market. As long as that goes smoothly, the cap would then rise every three months until it reached a ceiling, or steady state, of monthly run-offs. That still leaves a number of crucial unanswered questions. 1: When will the draw-down start? Fed officials have said they favor getting started in the second half of this year, but they probably won't want the first move to coincide with an interest-rate hike. And they're on course to lift rates two more times this year. In the New York Fed's latest survey of primary dealers, respondents thought the Fed would most likely move forward with rate increases in June and September before beginning to trim the balance sheet in the fourth quarter. If the start time for the run-off moves up to September or before, expect the second of those rate hikes to be delayed. 2: Where will the Fed set the caps for monthly run-offs? A few weeks ago, many economists were predicting the Fed would kick off the process by shedding about $20 billion a month. Those estimates have been dropping, especially since the Fed revealed that it favored phasing in the roll-offs. Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist and partner at Cornerstone MacroLLC in Washington, expects the first cap to land at $10 billion, rising by $10 billion every three months before settling after 15 months at a steady state of $60 billion. Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase, thinks they'll start at a combined $12 billion and add $12 billion each quarter. 3: How long will all this take? The precise answer here lies in the answers to the questions on the caps (see Question 2), which will determine the pace of runoffs, and on the preferred long-term size of the balance sheet, which depends on how officials want to manage short-term borrowing rates (see Question 5). Lacking those answers, it's safe only to say the whole process will take 5 to 10 years, assuming a recession doesn't come along and force the Fed to resume reinvestments, or even to buy whole new piles of bonds. 4: What will the mix be in the run-down between Treasuries and MBS? Of the $650 billion that could roll off the balance sheet in 2018 assuming no reinvestments, about $224 billion of that is in MBS, according to FTN's Schmidt. While officials haven't announced details about how they will handle the different sides of the portfolio, they have said they will look to tailor the plan to accommodate differences in the two markets. "I would be inclined to follow a similar approach in managing the reduction of the holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), calibrated according to their particular characteristics," Fed Governor Lael Brainard said May 30. Some analysts expect the Fed to split the caps evenly between Treasuries and MBS. Others, including Shehriyar Antia, a former policy advisor in the markets group at the New York Fed who is now chief market strategist at Macro Insight Group, think they'll go slower with MBS, a smaller market of which the Fed owns a bigger portion. His guess is that the initial cap for MBS will fall anywhere from $2 billion to $6 billion, while the Treasuries cap might be from $4 billion to $10 billion. 5: How big will the balance sheet be when they're done? Policymakers have continually stressed that, ultimately, the balance sheet may remain quite large compared to the size that prevailed before the financial crisis. One reason is that the economy has grown since then. Another is that the Fed has changed its operating framework for controlling short-term interest rates out of necessity. Whereas the old framework hinged on keeping central bank reserve balances held by banks scarce in order to control rates, the new system allows them to set rates even as the Fed's bond purchases have bloated reserves in the banking system. Choosing between the two systems could be the difference between shrinking the balance sheet by $1 trillion and $2 trillion, according to JPMorgan's Feroli. So far, almost all signals from the Fed are that they like the post-crisis system. "With almost a year and a half of experience with a federal funds target above the zero lower bound, our current approach has so far proved to be both effective and resilient to structural changes in the market," New York Fed Senior Vice President Lorie Logan, the number-two officer in the reserve bank's markets group, said during a May 18 speech. "The new framework is also quite simple and efficient from an operational perspective." Wall Street dealer banks that trade with Logan's team seem to think that is the way things are headed. In a New York Fed survey conducted in late April, the median respondent of the 23 dealers expected the balance sheet to be $3.1 trillion in size in 2025, with 22 percent of that-or $688 billion-backed by excess reserves. Fed Governor Jerome Powell may have revealed where Fed policy makers are aiming when he said June 1 that it's "hard to see" the balance sheet shrinking to below $2.5 trillion.

"Following" : "Follow"}} June 06, 2017 8:26am   Comments Share: Fast forward 20 years, how many of the world's 3,000 biggest companies in the world will be located in China? Ten percent seems like a reasonable to some, perhaps as much as 20 percent. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM)'s CEO Jamie Dimon thinks the number will be as high as 35 percent, or around 1,050 companies. Speaking to Bloomberg during the sidelines of the JPMorgan Global China Summit in Beijing, Dimon said that it is much easier to forecast China's 20-year outlook today. This is due to the fact that the government introduced much needed financial and market reforms. Granted, there will be periods of tough times in the near term, but this holds true for every single country, Dimon added. JPMorgan's Future In China If Dimon is uber-bullish on China's outlook, what exactly will the bank's role be over the next 20 years. JPMorgan already provides a lot of services to Chinese companies outside of the country, such as in Hong Kong. The bank did hold a joint venture in China which it exited in late 2016 but Dimon's long-term goal is to have its own 100 percent backed entity in Shanghai and Beijing. The only problem is Chinese law does not permit a foreign entity to operate in the country unless it is part of a joint venture. "We want [more] reform but we know they [the Chinese government] have to go at their own measured pace," Dimon answered. "It is complicated so we respect that and tell them what we would like and hopefully it will happen."

Subject to the conditions described in the Original Statement, the Company intends to provide full and unconditional guarantees of the CCR notes. The Total Consideration (as defined in the Original Statement) for each $1,000 principal amount of CCR notes tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the tender offer will be determined in the manner described in the Original Statement by reference to the bid-side yield to maturity of the applicable U.S. Treasury Security specified on the cover page of the Original Statement as measured by the dealer managers at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on June 6, 2017 plus the applicable fixed spread specified on the cover page of the Original Statement.

(Photo: AFP/Getty.) (Photo: PETER PARKS, AFP/Getty Images) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE Early July will mark the 100th month of the stock market's bullish expansion, and with that milestone will come the inevitable question: How much more time does the old guy have left? Nobody knows the answer, but here are some observations that could help put things into perspective: How does the current bull market compare historically? The current bullish phase is up there in age, though there's no specific expiration date when it comes to rising stock markets. The current span of roughly 99 mostly upward months since the cyclical low on March 9, 2009, is not unprecedented. The longest bull market of the past 90 or so years reached 115 months, spanning most of the 1990s, according to JP Morgan Asset Management. Still, the current expansion, the second-longest ever, has endured well beyond the average 55-month tenure for all bull markets.  It’s also the second largest advance, with a gain around 250 percent. It's also fair to say that current stock valuations aren't cheap, which can be a sign of trouble ahead. However, rising corporate profits lower valuations, and profits jumped 13% in the first quarter of 2017 — the best pace in more than five years, reported Zacks Investment Research. A sustained profit resurgence would give the market fresh legs. What typically ends bull markets? All sorts of catalysts could rattle investors — wars, political turmoil, interest-rate hikes and global trade tensions, among them. But the main factors that tend to trip up markets are recessions or elevated recession fears. When the economy rolls over, all sorts of bad stuff happens. Businesses fail, unemployment rises, profits evaporate and consumers grow fearful. The good news is that recessions typically are short-lived, lasting just 15 months on average against 47 months for the typical expansion phase, reports JP Morgan.

So based solely on the calendar, it's getting up there, too. But the strength of the expansion has been subdued, meaning the time element might not mean much. "It may be a blessing in disguise that the economic recovery over the past eight years has been one of the weakest in history," said Jeremy Kisner of Surevest Wealth Management in Phoenix, in a recent commentary. At any rate, a recession doesn't appear to be on the horizon, not with job growth continuing, profits rising and the Index of Leading Economic Indicators flashing a green light, to cite a few key signals. What impact would the next stock slump have on my investment portfolio? It depends on how sharp the downturn is and what your portfolio looks like. The last bear market was a whopper, with stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 index tumbling more than 55%. But few people hold all their assets in stocks. In fact, investors for the past several years have pulled more money from stock mutual funds than they have added, reports the Investment Company Institute. Most of the proceeds have gone into bond funds. So to the extend that you hold some cash and bond assets to complement your equity holdings, your downside would be muted. Some people might even welcome a stock bear market or correction. "Many people have been sitting on the sidelines waiting for a crash for several years while the market has continued to defy them," said Kisner. With so much cash on the sidelines earning such low yields, these investors would have incentive to put it into play the next time bargain hunting comes into vogue. That would help limit the fallout from a general market downdraft. Do demographic shifts signal long-term selling pressure on stock prices? There's been talk in recent years that the retiring Baby Boomer generation would start cashing in its collective stock holdings, forcing down prices. One oft-cited catalyst were required minimal distributions on Individual Retirement Accounts. In general, people must start withdrawing from these accounts after turning 70-1/2. But investors older than 70-1/2, assuming they hold stocks at all, can take their withdrawals gradually, and they can reinvest the proceeds back into the stock market, in unsheltered accounts. So while the RMD rules do force investors to liquidate their retirement accounts, they don't mandate that the money come out of the stock market, especially all at once. At any rate, the oldest Boomers are now in their 70s and their withdrawals haven't triggered a market decline so far. Should the bull market continue to push higher later this year, then the whispers about an aging bull market will become louder, and more investors will search for signs of cracks in the foundation. Eventually, the bullish phase will end, and the cycle will begin anew. "We will all miss it until the next one begins, likely just a year or two later," Kisner said.

A lot is at stake. Simply maintaining that over-sized stack of bonds makes the Fed a big player in the markets for Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. Investors and traders are anxious for information about how the central bank intends to pull back. "There are so many different parameters by which they could set this process," said Tom Simons, a senior economist at Jefferies LLC in New York. "There's a wide range of market implications as a result for what the public supply of Treasuries is going to be and how liquid the MBS market is going to be." What we know so far At the moment, when a bond in that portfolio matures or gets paid back early, the Fed reinvests the returned principal. To shrink the balance sheet, all the Fed has to do is stop reinvesting. But the idea of halting that process all at once makes the Fed nervous about possibly disrupting markets. Stopping now would shrink the portfolio by about $280 billion over the last seven months of 2017, and by about $650 billion in 2018, according to Walter Schmidt, the Chicago-based senior vice president at FTN Financial, and data from The Yield Book. At their May meeting, policy makers backed a plan to reduce each month's reinvestments by a set, and as-yet undecided, dollar amount. That sum will roll off the balance sheet and any maturities above the cap will be plowed back into the market. As long as that goes smoothly, the cap would then rise every three months until it reached a ceiling, or steady state, of monthly run-offs. That still leaves a number of crucial unanswered questions.   Question 1: When will the draw-down start? Fed officials have said they favor getting started in the second half of this year, but they probably won't want the first move to coincide with an interest-rate hike. And they're on course to lift rates two more times this year. In the New York Fed's latest survey of primary dealers, respondents thought the Fed would most likely move forward with rate increases in June and September before beginning to trim the balance sheet in the fourth quarter. If the start time for the run-off moves up to September or before, expect the second of those rate hikes to be delayed. Question 2: Where will the Fed set the caps for monthly run-offs? A few weeks ago, many economists were predicting the Fed would kick off the process by shedding about $20 billion a month. Those estimates have been dropping, especially since the Fed revealed that it favored phasing in the roll-offs. Roberto Perli, a former Fed economist and partner at Cornerstone MacroLLC in Washington, expects the first cap to land at $10 billion, rising by $10 billion every three months before settling after 15 months at a steady state of $60 billion. Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., thinks they'll start at a combined $12 billion and add $12 billion each quarter. Question 3: How long will all this take? The precise answer here lies in the answers to the questions on the caps (see Question 2), which will determine the pace of runoffs, and on the preferred long-term size of the balance sheet, which depends on how officials want to manage short-term borrowing rates (see Question 5). Lacking those answers, it's safe only to say the whole process will take 5 to 10 years, assuming a recession doesn't come along and force the Fed to resume reinvestments, or even to buy whole new piles of bonds. Question 4: What will the mix be in the run-down between Treasuries and MBS? Of the $650 billion that could roll off the balance sheet in 2018 assuming no reinvestments, about $224 billion of that is in MBS, according to FTN's Schmidt. While officials haven't announced details about how they will handle the different sides of the portfolio, they have said they will look to tailor the plan to accommodate differences in the two markets. "I would be inclined to follow a similar approach in managing the reduction of the holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities (MBS), calibrated according to their particular characteristics," Fed Governor Lael Brainard said May 30.  Some analysts expect the Fed to split the caps evenly between Treasuries and MBS. Others, including Shehriyar Antia, a former policy advisor in the markets group at the New York Fed who is now chief market strategist at Macro Insight Group, think they'll go slower with MBS, a smaller market of which the Fed owns a bigger portion. His guess is that the initial cap for MBS will fall anywhere from $2 billion to $6 billion, while the Treasuries cap might be from $4 billion to $10 billion.   Question 5: How big will the balance sheet be when they're done? Policy makers have continually stressed that, ultimately, the balance sheet may remain quite large compared to the size that prevailed before the financial crisis. One reason is that the economy has grown since then. Another is that the Fed has changed its operating framework for controlling short-term interest rates out of necessity. Whereas the old framework hinged on keeping central bank reserve balances held by banks scarce in order to control rates, the new system allows them to set rates even as the Fed's bond purchases have bloated reserves in the banking system.

Jones in photo from her LinkedIn page. BY LINCOLN ANDERSON | The 60-year-old woman fatally struck by a private garbage truck on Tues., May 16, at Eighth St. and Sixth Ave., was an Ivy League-educated financial adviser and broker and a founding member of the W. Eighth St. Block Association. As of last week’s Villager deadline, police had not yet released the victim’s name pending family notification. Fern B. Jones lived at Nine W. Eighth St., near Fifth Ave. — a little less than a block away from where she was horrifically crushed by the carting truck. Jones is listed as having financial businesses registered at Apartment No. 2 at Nine W. Eighth St. Her LinkedIn page lists her as having been president since 2005 of FJ Co, a company that “enhances portfolios.” Her jobs before that included director of portfolio management at MetLife, senior investment analyst for global fixed income for General Motors Asset Management, and mortgage analyst and a trader/risk manager at JPMorgan Chase. Jones received a bachelor of arts from Yale in 1981 and a master’s degree in management and finance from M.I.T. in 1998. Members were informed of Jones’s death in a message on Mon., May 22, from Laurie Moody, secretary of the W. Eighth St. Block Association, on behalf of its co-chairpersons, Cormac Flynn and Carol Wilson. “We remember Fern as a good friend and valued community member, who worked hard to improve the quality of life on our block,” the e-mail said, in part. “She will be greatly missed here.” Sharon Woolums recalled Jones as “a very sweet, intelligent member of the block association. I saw Fern recently and am shocked by the news,” she said. The private carting-company truck that fatally struck longtime W. Eighth St. resident Fern B. Jones on Sixth Ave. Tuesday evening. Photo by C4P Jones’s sister Ruth told the block association that Fern will be buried in Virginia on Memorial Day weekend and that the family is planning a memorial in New York this summer. Following the publication of a brief article about Jones’s death in last week’s Villager, a spokesperson for M&M Sanitation Corp. reached out to say the truck was going just 4 miles per hour when it hit Jones. A Police Department spokesperson said she could not definitively answer how fast the truck was going at the time of the incident, and that the department’s Collision Investigation Squad was still investigating. The New York Post reported Jones was crossing Sixth Ave. at W. Eighth St. when, according to witnesses, she was struck, then dragged and crushed under the tires of the mammoth garbage rig. Police said she had been trying to cross from the north side of W. Eighth St. to the south side.

Thanks to our robust business model, our dedicated and experienced teams and our global footprint, we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver profitable growth in line with the Group's vision: to be at the forefront of change in the mobility sector." STRUCTURE OF THE GLOBAL OFFERING The Offered Shares are being offered as part of the Global Offering consisting of: an international offering (the "International Offering") primarily to institutional investors, which will be composed of: a private placement in France; and an international private placement in certain other countries, including in the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A ("Rule 144A") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and outside of the United States in reliance on Regulation S ("Regulation S") under the Securities Act; and a public offering in France, by way of an open price offer (offre à prix ouvert) (the "French Public Offering"). At least 10% of the total number of shares offered in the Global Offering, prior exercise of the over-allotment option (the "Over-Allotment Option"), will be allocated to the French Public Offering provided there is sufficient demand. If demand in the French Public Offering is less than 10% of the Offered Shares in the Global Offering (excluding the exercise of the Over-Allotment Option), the remaining Firm Shares not allocated to the French Public Offering will be allocated under the International Offering. Purchase orders will be categorized by the number of shares requested:    • A1 orders: between 10 and 200 shares (included);    • A2 orders: more than 200 shares. The A1 orders will benefit from preferential treatment as compared to the A2 orders in the event that all A orders cannot be satisfied in their entirety. It is further specified that each order should be placed for a minimum number of 10 shares. SIZE OF THE GLOBAL OFFERING The Global Offering consists of 80,820,728 existing shares sold by the Selling Shareholder, which number may be increased to a maximum of 92,943,837 shares sold by Selling Shareholder in the event of the exercise in full of the Over-Allotment Option. The stabilizing manager, on behalf of the underwriters, has been granted an option to purchase additional existing shares sold by the Selling Shareholder that represent up to 15% of the Firm Shares, ie a maximum of 12,123,109 Offered Shares. Including overallotment option, the total size of the Global Offering is between approximately €1,320 million and €1,617 million. STABILIZATION J.P. Morgan Securities PLC (or any entity acting on its behalf), acting as stabilizing manager on behalf of the underwriters, may (but is under no obligation to) carry any and all stabilization operations deemed useful aiming to support ALD's share price in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, in particular the provisions of EU Parliament and Council Regulation 596/2014 of 16 April 2014 and Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 of 8 March 2016. There is, however, no obligation for the stabilizing manager to undertake such transactions and such transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time and without warning. Stabilization transactions are intended to support the market price of the shares and may support a price higher than that which might otherwise prevail in the open market. In the event that the stabilizing manager undertakes stabilization transactions, such transactions may take place at any time during 30 calendar days following the determination of the Offering Price, or any time between 15 June 2017 and 14 July 2017, according to the indicative timetable. The stabilizing manager will ensure that the public and the competent market regulators are informed in accordance with Article 5.5 of the Regulation and Article 6 of the Delegated Regulation. Therefore, during the stabilization period, the persons designated as responsible ensure adequate public disclosure of the details of all stabilization transactions no later than the end of the seventh daily market session following the date of such transactions. The Joint Global Coordinators, Joint Lead Managers and Joint Bookrunners, on behalf of the underwriters, may decide to over-allot up to the number of shares covered by the Over-Allotment Option increased, as the case may be, by a number of shares representing 5% of the aggregate amount of the Offering, in accordance with Article 8 (b) of the Delegated Regulation. In compliance with Article 7.1 of the Delegated Regulation, stabilization transactions may not be effected at a price greater than the Offering Price. THE INDICATIVE OFFERING PRICE RANGE For information purposes, the indicative Offering Price range is set between €14.20 and €17.40 per share. This price range for the Offering is indicative only and the Offering Price may be set outside of this range. The indicative Offering Price range may be modified at any time up to and including the date of the determination of the Offering Price. In the event that the high end of the indicative Offering Price range is increased, or in the event that the Offering Price is set above the high end of the indicative Offering Price range, the closing date of the French Public Offering will be deferred or a new offering period will be opened, as applicable, so that there are at least two market days between the press release announcing such change and the revised closing date of the French Public Offering. Purchase orders placed in connection with the French Public Offering prior to the date of such press release will be maintained unless they are expressly revoked prior to or on the revised closing date of the French Public Offering. The Offering Price may be fixed below the indicative Offering Price range without restriction or the low end of the indicative Offering Price range may be lowered without restriction, provided that there is no material impact on the other terms and conditions of the Offering. INDICATIVE TIMETABLE FOR THE GLOBAL OFFERING The offering period for the French Public Offering will open on 5 June 2017 and is expected to close on 14 June 2017 at 5:00 PM (Paris time) for orders made at the branches of financial institutions and 8:00 PM (Paris time) for orders placed online. The offering period for the International Offering will open on 5 June 2017 and is expected to close on 15 June 2017 at 1:00 PM (Paris time), subject to early closing or extension. Orders made by retail investors via the Internet in the French Public Offering will be revocable, via the Internet, until the closing of the French Public Offering (on 14 June 2017 at 8:00 PM, Paris time). Individuals are responsible for liaising with their respective financial intermediaries in order to confirm whether the orders submitted by other means are revocable and if so under what conditions (including whether orders submitted via the Internet can be revoked by means other than via the Internet). Any order issued in the context of the International Offering can be revoked through the Joint Global Coordinators, and Joint Bookrunners listed below having received the relevant order until until 15 June 2017 at 1:00 PM (Paris time), unless the offering period is closed early or postponed. The Offering Price is expected to be determined on 15 June 2017. Trading of the shares is expected to start on 16 June 2017, on the regulated market of Euronext Paris under the ticker symbol "ALD AIW (as-if-and-when-delivered") until the settlement date. The date of the settlement and delivery of the Offering is expected to occur on 19 June 2017, provided that the Offering Price is determined on 15 June 2017. Trading of the shares is expected to start on 20 June 2017 on the regulated market of Euronext Paris on a listing line called "ALD". REASONS FOR THE OFFERING The listing of the shares on Euronext Paris is intended to enable ALD to gain visibility and reputation in the mobility ecosystem as well as to access to new means of financing and to increase its capacity to accelerate its development and to seize new growth opportunities in both the corporate and B2C markets. The Selling Shareholder will receive the net proceeds from the sale of the Firm Shares and, if the Over-Allotment Option is exercised, from the sale of the Offered Shares.

The comptroller of the currency will play a key role in Trump's plan to roll back Dodd-Frank regulations. The nomination followed a Trump tweet blaming Democrats for a slow rate of nominees' approvals, despite Republicans controlling the Senate and few named nominations. Leslie Shaffer | @LeslieShaffer1 Monday, 5 Jun 2017 | 9:38 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES Patrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images Joseph Otting, then-CEO of OneWest Bank, smiles during a public meeting held by the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in Los Angeles, California, U.S., on Thursday, Feb. 26, 2015. White House plans nominations to key posts, including comptroller of the currency The Trump administration announced plans for long-delayed nominations to key posts, including tapping former One West CEO Joseph Otting for comptroller of the currency. Otting, whose name first began being floated for the role back in March, worked closely with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at One West, which Mnuchin purchased in 2009. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is an independent agency within the Treasury and is responsible for overseeing the nation's biggest banks, including Bank of America, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. The position is expected to play a significant role in carrying out U.S. President Donald Trump's promise to roll back regulations — including doing a "number" on the sweeping law known as Dodd-Frank that was implemented following the 2008 financial crisis. Senate confirmation is required for the role. Trump has received criticism for moving slowly on a series of senior political appointments, a delay he used a tweet on Monday to blame on Democrats in Congress, despite Republicans controlling both the House and Senate. Donald J. Trump‏: .@foxandfriends Dems are taking forever to approve my people, including Ambassadors. They are nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS! Want approvals. Trump has formally nominated 63 of the 559 positions which require Senate confirmation, with 39 confirmed, 16 awaiting nominations and 441 lacking any nominee, according to the Partnership for Public Service. Those totals didn't appear to include the nine planned nominations announced late Monday. Other planned nominations announced on Tuesday included Owen West, a former marine and a Goldman Sachs alum, to be the assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low intensity conflict. David Pekoske, a former vice commandant with the U.S. Coast Guard, was tapped to be the assistant secretary of homeland security, with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Brian Allen Benczkowski, a partner at the Washington, DC office of law firm Kirkland & Ellis, was tapped for the role of assistant attorney general for the criminal division at the Department of Justice, the press release said. Steven Bradbury, a litigation partner at Dechert LLP in Washington, DC, was tapped for the role of general counsel of transportation. —Ylan Mui contributed to this article.

Although the market poked its head into positive territory a couple of times on Monday, by the time the closing bell rang, the S&P 500 was at 2,436.10, down 0.12%. That kind of setback would have been plenty palatable relative to the losses Herbalife Ltd. (NYSE:HLF), Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ:INCY) and Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) dished out today, however. Here’s a look at what upended each name. Snap Inc (SNAP) Not that analyst doubts about the future of Snapchat parent Snap are anything new, but there is something about seeing them in print that can spook investors. JPMorgan did the deed today, lowering its price target on SNAP from $20 to $18, and simultaneously establishing a neutral rating on the stock. Analyst Doug Anmuth is concerned that the company could struggle to monetize its user base, and may not be able to turn any sort of a profit until 2020. Anmuth thinks the year-over-year comparisons for the upcoming quarterly report will roll in 20% weaker as the Olympics and a heated race for President kept users glued to the platform in mid-2016. Snap stock was only down 4.2% following the release of the pessimistic opinion. But, with today’s setback, SNAP shares are also down 30% from March’s post-IPO peak, and still fighting what appears to be a losing battle. Incyte Corporation (INCY) On the surface, the data Incyte presented this weekend at the annual ASCO conference is compelling. The combination of its enzyme inhibitor epacadostat and Keytruda, from Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), had an overall response rate of 35%. That’s statistically significant enough to get the Food and Drug Administration’s nod of approval. A closer look at the data, however, isn’t quite as encouraging to INCY shareholders. For whatever reasons, Incyte excluded the trial data for three patients in the study, and the study is already suspiciously small at only 43 patients. The information for those other three individuals existed. Incyte just chose not to incorporate it into its presentation. 10 Stocks to Buy Before They Go and Finally Join the Rally INCY shareholders understandably interpreted it as a red flag, sending the stock to a loss of 5.7% for Monday’s session. Herbalife Ltd. (HLF) Finally, vitamin and supplement outfit Herbalife saw its stock dip 6.6% after the company culled its revenue outlook for the quarter currently underway. For its second fiscal quarter ending this month, Herbalife now expects to report growth of between only 2% and 6%. Though the company also upped its Q2 profit forecast from a range of 88 cents to $1.08 per share to a range of between 95 cents and $1.15 per share of HLF, activist investor and Herbalife bear Bill Ackman was quick to chime in, pointing out the fact that the lowered guidance comes after raised guidance from May 4, and after a handful of insiders sold their sizable stakes. He’s not making an accusation, but it certainly doesn’t look good. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Photo by Doug Strickland /Times Free Press. Skuid relocates to Liberty Tower Skuid Inc., creators of the leading cloud user experience (UX) design platform, relocated Tuesday to Liberty Tower on Chestnut Street in downtown Chattanooga. The company will initially occupy the sixth, seventh and eighth floors of the LEED Gold Certified building. Since founding the company in 2013, Skuid has lived in four different locations: the Plow Building, the Southern Saddlery Building, the Republic Plaza, and now the Liberty Tower. The moves give testament to Skuid's rapid growth since it launched with five people. When the company moved into its current space in the Republic Plaza in April of 2016, its team had grown to 55 members. Today, the Skuid "skuad" has mushroomed to more than 160 employees at its headquarters in Chattanooga and offices in the Bay Area, London, and Zurich. "We're staying in Chattanooga for a combination of compelling reasons. Chattanooga has the Gig, a reasonable cost of living and a much better qualify of life for our people," says Ken McElrath, Skuid founder and CEO. At 36,921 square feet, the new Skuid offices will provide enough room for the company's near-term growth, McElrath said.   Kentucky distributor recalls ground beef The U.S. Department of Agriculture says a Kentucky-based food distributor has issued a recall on more than 22,000 pounds of ground beef and other beef products due to possible E. coli bacteria contamination. USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service says the Creation Gardens Inc. products subject to the recall were shipped to food service locations in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee. The department says the problem was discovered Monday when plant management at the Louisville-based company notified Food Safety and Inspection Service officials of positive test results for E.coli. Officials say the raw ground beef and beef primal cut products affected by the recall were produced from May 31 to June 2. The products subject to recall bear establishment number "EST. 7914" inside the USDA mark of inspection.   Uber dismisses 20 following law firm probe SAN FRANCUSCO — Uber has fired more than 20 employees after a law firm investigated complaints of sexual harassment, bullying, discrimination and other violations of company policies. A Uber spokeswoman says the firm Perkins Coie was hired after former engineer Susan Fowler posted a blog in February about sex harassment at the ride-hailing company. Fowler wrote that on her first day at work her boss propositioned her in a series of messages. The Perkins Coie probe is separate from one being done by former Attorney General Eric Holder. He is likely to make broader recommendations on how to change Uber's culture when his report is released publicly next week.   CEO optimism rises to highest in 3 years Despite some stumbles by President Donald Trump, chief executives of America's largest companies are more optimistic about the economy than they have been in three years, according to survey results released Tuesday. The CEOs remain hopeful about a sweeping overhaul of the tax code, including a steep cut in the corporate rate, despite limited details so far from the White House and the lack of formal legislation in Congress. Those developments have led the Trump administration to back off its expectation to get tax reform enacted by August. But hopes remain high that major tax changes are coming soon, according to the 148 chief executives surveyed this month by the Business Roundtable trade group. "The survey results reflect confidence from America's leading employers in the prospects for tax reform as well as the tangible economic benefits that tax reform will produce," said Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan Chase & Co., and chairman of the group, which is composed of the heads of about 200 of the largest U.S companies.   Satellite-TV's Dish fined in robocall suit An Illinois judge has ordered satellite-TV company Dish to pay $280 million for calling people who said they didn't want to be bothered by telemarketers. The court found that Dish "caused millions and millions of violations of the Do Not Call Laws." Telemarketers are barred from calling people who have joined federal or state do-not-call registries or who've asked companies to leave them alone. The Justice Department said the $280 million penalty was the biggest ever penalty for telemarketing violations. Dish Network Corp. says it will appeal the ruling. It says the penalties are unfairly large and it's being held responsible for telemarketing done by contractors, who in some cases hid what they were doing from Dish.

More videos Interest rates steady for now The Reserve Bank leaves the cash rate at 1.5 per cent. Eryk Bagshaw explains the decision. But several banks have revised down their forecasts ahead of the release of the national accounts, with the Commonwealth Bank predicting growth of just 0.1 per cent. The National Australia Bank has forecast a negative result of -0.1 per cent. Figures released on Tuesday showed Australia's current account [the difference between all imports and exports] recorded the smallest deficit in 15 years, but it may not be enough to stave off only the fourth quarter of negative growth since the recession of the early 1990s. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Treasurer Scott Morrison Photo: Alex Ellinghausen "The release of the data on exports and government investment in the first quarter has led us to revise down our forecast for gross domestic product growth in the first quarter from 0.3 per cent to -0.5 per cent," said Capital Economics Chief Australia & New Zealand Economist Paul Dales. Mr Dales said "things would get very tricky" for the Reserve Bank if GDP fell in the first three months of this year and then again in the next quarter. Advertisement "Even if the Reserve Bank still doesn't want to cut interest rates below 1.5 per cent for fear of stoking the housing market and even if it thinks any such recession is due to temporary factors, it would be very brave for it to sit on its hands when the papers are shouting about the first recession in 26 years," he said. In leaving interest rates on hold at record lows for the 10th consecutive month on Tuesday, the Reserve Bank was more optimistic. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link RBA governor Philip Lowe. Photo: Bloomberg "Looking forward, economic growth is still expected to increase gradually over the next couple of years to a little above 3 per cent," Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe said. The board left monetary policy unchanged due to the "slow growth in real wages," mixed housing market outcomes, and the decline in the price of iron ore and coal, while inflation moved back towards the the bank's target of between 2-3 per cent. Analysts said the economic results for the first three months of this year came in "weaker than expected" taking particular aim at the Turnbull government's "disappointing spending," despite the Coalition's investment and infrastructure rhetoric. "Of most significance to our GDP forecasts, government spending numbers released today disappointed badly," said JP Morgan's Tom Kennedy. "Government consumption rose just 1 per cent quarter on quarter, and more significantly, public capital expenditure posted a large decline of 2.7 per cent." Mr Morrison said the government had invested $75 billion in infrastructure and foreshadowed weaker GDP outcomes in May's budget. "This more conservative forecast is broadly consistent with the Reserve Bank, international organisations and private sector economists," he said. "These are all reasons to be more optimistic about the days ahead, but such days must be secured." Commsec economist Craig James said the "world's longest economic expansion was still intact." To keep the economy ticking along, five of 23 forecasters surveyed by Bloomberg are now beginning to predict a cut within the next year, as house prices begin to cool in the overheated eastern housing markets. Dwelling prices fell by 1.7 per cent in Melbourne and 1.3 per cent in Sydney, during the seasonally weak month of May according to property monitor Core Logic. The more house prices calm down, the more room the Reserve Bank has to cut rates by minimising the risk of stoking the market. "If this recent slowing develops into a more sustained trend, the Bank may be able to consider alternative scenarios to a steady cash rate," said CoreLogic's head of research, Tim Lawless. The market is now pricing in a 21 per cent chance of rate cut within the next year. 12 comments Comment are now closed Sort comments by Oldest Newest Advertisement HuffPost Australia Bill Gates May Soon Lose His Spot As ...

Telecom industry is at its weakest, govt will have to step in Business Standard Adani giving itself the green light does not change the economics of coal Coal mining is not economically viable within the constraints of a global carbon budget Samantha Hepburn | The Conversation  June 7, 2017 Last Updated at 10:03 IST email this article Message: Recipients' Email: Type address separated by commas Your Email: Enter the characters shown in the image. Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2UWRf9l Mining. Photo: Reuters ALSO READ Queensland Premier reaffirms commitment to Adani's coal mine project Adani to finalise Australia's Carmichael coal investment plan by June Australian delegation asks Adani to drop mine project Adani's Carmichael coal mine seals royalty pact with Queensland govt Adani Enterprises defers investment decision on Australian coal project Indian mining firm Adani announced on Tuesday that its board had approved plans to proceed with the controversial Carmichael coal mine in Queensland’s Galilee Basin. But it is still far from clear whether Adani has actually obtained the finance to proceed with the A$16.5 billion project, or whether it has secured the necessary A$1.1 billion loan from the government’s Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility needed for the mine’s railway. That hasn’t stopped the state government hailing the announcement as an economic win for Queensland, on the basis of job creation and for the signals it provides to potential investors in the region. But this amounts to little more than short-sighted politics. The government appears to be steadfastly ignoring the realities of the current energy landscape. Let’s recap: coal mining is not economically viable within the constraints of a global carbon budget, while renewable energy production is rapidly expanding as the world moves to more sustainable investments. The result is that coal projects could become stranded assets, with price tags that may already exceed what would have been the costs of a timely implementation of climate action. Investors and lending institutions are shifting to sustainable projects that limit the risk of catastrophic environmental damage. The people own the coal The state government owns the coal resource, but it is a special type of ownership. This is “public resource” ownership, meaning that all decisions made by the state government to exploit it must be in the interest of the public as a whole. Issuing resource titles that allow Adani to proceed with a vast coal mine – in defiance of the social, economic and environmental impacts of such a project within a carbon-constrained economy – arguably represents a dereliction of the state’s duty to act in the public interest. It also ignores the fact that in order to have just a 50% chance of keeping global warming within 2 degrees Celsius, a key aim of the Paris climate agreement, 90 per cent of Australia’s current coal reserves must stay in the ground. If the mine proceeds, it will contribute substantially to global warming and accelerate the destruction of one of the world’s greatest natural assets, the Great Barrier Reef. This could have huge knock-on effects for future tourism in the area, which generates A$6 billion a year. The economics of the Adani coal mine simply do not make sense. While there may be limited short-term employment opportunities and royalty gains for the state should the project actually get financed, the longer-term projections are dire. The thermal coal market is in decline. What’s more, the Carmichael mine will produce low-ranking thermal coal with a high ash content, making it carbon-intensive even by coal’s standards, and bringing with it considerable health risks. With this in mind, it seems short-sighted to subsidise an anticipated production of between 25 million and 60 million tonnes of coal a year. Put simply, coal is not a sustainable resource for energy production. This climate perspective informs the market. India, for example, cannot be relied upon as a guaranteed market for this low-quality coal. This is particularly evident in the recent unveiling of India’s new power plan, which calls for a dramatic increase in renewable energy production. This will have a deleterious impact on all Australian coal markets, and makes the decision to pursue low-quality coal reserves all the more untenable. The banks know this. Westpac, ANZ, NAB, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citi, BNP Paribas, Société Générale and Crédit Agricole are among the domestic and international banks that have declined to fund the project, while the Commonwealth Bank has quit as the project’s financial adviser. This is why the question of financing is so fraught. The major banks understand the fact that longer term, the Adani coal mine has no future. They are also concerned about the financial impact of stranded assets. Westpac, for example, made it very clear earlier this year that it aims to shift lending to sustainable economic models, and would increase lending to this sector to A$25 billion by 2030. It also made it clear that any funding for coal projects would henceforth be limited to existing coal projects with high-quality coal. Other major banks have adopted similar stances. Where next? So what happens now? The government may decide to fund Adani’s railway, but that does not necessarily mean the mine itself will ever actually move forward. If and when Adani’s project does fall over, consideration should be given to whether the government should be held accountable for breaching public interest responsibilities in issuing the resource titles in the first place. Of course, this necessarily presumes the financing for the Adani mine will actually proceed. To reiterate, there is no evidence that this has actually occurred. Getting government approval, and a green light from one’s own board, does not mean that Adani actually has the funding required to go ahead and dig the coal. In the end, the real question is whether any lending institution will seriously take a risk on this vast and irresponsible project, which ignores both the safety of the Great Barrier Reef and the fundamentals of carbon-constrained economics.

Buy Home Insurance Cover from Earthquake & Floods. Buy Home Insurance Adani giving itself the green light does not change the economics of coal Coal mining is not economically viable within the constraints of a global carbon budget Coal mining is not economically viable within the constraints of a global carbon budget Indian mining firm Adani announced on Tuesday that its board had approved plans to proceed with the controversial Carmichael coal mine in Queensland’s Galilee Basin. But it is still far from clear whether Adani has actually obtained the finance to proceed with the A$16.5 billion project, or whether it has secured the necessary A$1.1 billion loan from the government’s Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility needed for the mine’s railway. That hasn’t stopped the state government hailing the announcement as an economic win for Queensland, on the basis of job creation and for the signals it provides to potential investors in the region. But this amounts to little more than short-sighted politics. The government appears to be steadfastly ignoring the realities of the current energy landscape. Let’s recap: coal mining is not economically viable within the constraints of a global carbon budget, while renewable energy production is rapidly expanding as the world moves to more sustainable investments. The result is that coal projects could become stranded assets, with price tags that may already exceed what would have been the costs of a timely implementation of climate action. Investors and lending institutions are shifting to sustainable projects that limit the risk of catastrophic environmental damage. The people own the coal The state government owns the coal resource, but it is a special type of ownership. This is “public resource” ownership, meaning that all decisions made by the state government to exploit it must be in the interest of the public as a whole. Issuing resource titles that allow Adani to proceed with a vast coal mine – in defiance of the social, economic and environmental impacts of such a project within a carbon-constrained economy – arguably represents a dereliction of the state’s duty to act in the public interest. It also ignores the fact that in order to have just a 50% chance of keeping global warming within 2 degrees Celsius, a key aim of the Paris climate agreement, 90 per cent of Australia’s current coal reserves must stay in the ground. If the mine proceeds, it will contribute substantially to global warming and accelerate the destruction of one of the world’s greatest natural assets, the Great Barrier Reef. This could have huge knock-on effects for future tourism in the area, which generates A$6 billion a year. The economics of the Adani coal mine simply do not make sense. While there may be limited short-term employment opportunities and royalty gains for the state should the project actually get financed, the longer-term projections are dire. The thermal coal market is in decline. What’s more, the Carmichael mine will produce low-ranking thermal coal with a high ash content, making it carbon-intensive even by coal’s standards, and bringing with it considerable health risks. With this in mind, it seems short-sighted to subsidise an anticipated production of between 25 million and 60 million tonnes of coal a year.

Bloomberg News Jun 7, 2017 at 8:29 am | Print View Joseph Otting, a University of Northern Iowa graduate who grew up in Maquoketa and was a former lieutenant of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin’s at OneWest Bank, has been tapped to lead a U.S. regulator that oversees more than 1,000 lenders — including Wall Street giants. President Donald Trump plans to nominate Otting to run the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the White House said in a statement Monday evening. If confirmed by the Senate, he will play a central role in trying to ease financial rules that the administration blames for stunting economic growth. The appointment would mark a reversal in roles for Otting, as the OCC regulated OneWest when he was the bank’s CEO. The selection continues Trump’s predilection for filling government jobs with former finance executives, even though he routinely criticized the industry on the campaign trail. Otting’s confirmation would give Mnuchin a key ally in changing the regulatory tone in Washington, D.C., by dialing back aggressive scrutiny of banks. The agency is being run by former bank lawyer Keith Noreika. OneWest named Otting CEO in October 2010, with then-chairman Mnuchin praising his knowledge of the southern California market. After CIT Group Inc. acquired OneWest in 2014, Otting was co-president for a few months before being replaced. Otting, who now lives in Nevada, probably will face the same kind of hammering from Senate Banking Committee Democrats over OneWest’s business practices that Mnuchin endured during his conformation process. The bank, created after IndyMac’s collapse during the 2008 financial crisis, seized properties from tens of thousands of homeowners, foreclosures that some Democrats have called unfair and improper. As CEO, Otting arguably had more involvement in the company’s day-to-day operations than Mnuchin did as chairman. In 2011, OneWest was involved in an enforcement action in which the government ordered mortgage servicers to review whether their foreclosure practices were appropriate. It took four years — most of Otting’s tenure — for the company to satisfy the concerns of the OCC and other banking regulators. The White House described Otting as having “a long career in financial services working for a number of highly regarded regional banks.” If he takes over the OCC, Otting will run an independent agency within the Treasury Department that supervises the banking units of major financial institutions including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America. He also would become a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.’s board and the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Otting, who holds a bachelor’s degree from the UNI, would be the first comptroller in decades without an advanced degree, as the agency’s most recent heads have all held law degrees. His biographical information from the White House lists him as a graduate of the “School of Credit and Financial Management at Dartmouth College,” which is a continuing-education program for financial executives that operated on the campus of the Ivy League institution, but isn’t actually affiliated with it.

Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2UWRDSh ALSO READ With H-1B visas under Trump cloud, TCS to step up local hiring in the US India's pain and gain from Donald Trump's curb on H-1B visas US intensifies H-1B visas scrutiny, heat on freshers TCS, Infosys accounted for only 8.8% of total H-1B visas: Nasscom Top seven India-based IT companies in the US collectively experienced a whopping 37 per cent drop in approved H-1B visa petitions in 2016 as compared to the previous year, according to a new report that comes amid the Trump administration's crackdown on the "visa abuse". The companies experienced a drop of 5,436 approved petitions (37 per cent) in 2016 as compared to the previous year, said a report by the National Foundation for American Policy — a Washington-based non-profit think-tank. It said that the 9,356 new H-1B petitions for the top seven India-based companies approved in fiscal 2016 represent only 0.006 per cent of the US labour force. "While the threat of job loss has long been exaggerated by critics, it reaches illogical proportions when discussing fewer than 10,000 workers in an economy that employs 160 million workers nationwide," the National Foundation for American Policy said in a statement after releasing the report. The report comes after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order in April for tightening the rules of the H-1B visa programme to stop "visa abuses". Trump said his administration is going to enforce 'Hire American' rules that are designed to protect jobs and wages of workers in the US. The executive order also called upon the Departments of Labour, Justice, Homeland Security, and the state to take action against fraud and abuse of the US' visa programmes. According to the report, the number of approved new H-1B petitions for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) declined by 56 per cent from FY 2015 to FY 2016, from 4,674 to 2,040, a drop of 2,634. For Wipro, the petitions declined by 52 per cent between FY 2015 and FY 2016, a drop of 1,605, going from 3,079 to 1,474 approved petitions for initial employment during those years. For Infosys, it declined by 16 per cent (or 454 petitions), with 2,376 approved H-1B petitions for initial employment in FY 2016, compared to 2,830 in FY 2015, said the report, which based its research on government data. "The drop in new H-1B visas for India-based companies, which is expected to continue when data are released on cases filed in April 2017 for FY 2018 start dates, is due to industry trends toward digital services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, which require fewer workers, and a choice by companies to rely less on visas and to build up their domestic workforces in the US," the report said. "H-1B petitions approved for initial employment in FY 2016 were filed by employers in April 2016, which means the drop in H-B visa use by these companies is not due to Donald Trump's election. "In the past, US policymakers have used the number of visas going to India-based companies as a political or policy reason to propose new immigration restrictions and to not raise the low annual supply of H-1B visas, which has been exhausted every year for the past 15 fiscal years," said NFAP executive director Stuart Anderson, former head of policy at the Immigration and Naturalisation Service under President George W Bush. Among the top companies with new H-1B petitions approved in 2016 were Cognizant (3,949), Infosys (2,376), TCS (2,040), Accenture (1,889), IBM (1,608), Wipro (1,474), Amazon (1,416), Tech Mahindra (1,228), CapGemini (1,164), Microsoft (1,145), HCL America (1,041), Intel (1,030), Deloitte (985), Google (924), Larsen &Toubro (870), PricewaterhouseCoopers (713), Ernst & Young (649), Apple (631), Syntel (583), Facebook (472), Oracle (427), Cisco (380), Mindtree (327), Goldman Sachs (287), UST Global (283), JPMorganChase (271), IGATE (255), Stanford (221), Yahoo!

An analysis of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) data on FY 2016 H-1B petitions shows, similar to FY 2015, approximately 25,000 different US employers hired at least one high-skilled foreign national on a new H-1B petition in 2016. Employers in manufacturing include Tesla Motors with 108 approved new H-1B petitions and Cummins with 197. Uber had 121 approved H-1B petitions in FY 2016, eBay 115, and the Mayo Clinic 111. National Foundation for American Policy said the April 2017 unemployment rate in the US for "computer and mathematical science" occupations was 2.5 per cent - a very low rate, even lower than the 4.4 per cent for "all occupations," according to the Bureau of Labour Statistics data. The unemployment rate for "architecture and engineering" occupations is even lower at 2.1 per cent, it said, adding this illustrates a disconnect between reality and claims that high-skilled foreign nationals are preventing US workers from pursuing careers in tech fields. According to Code.Org, Bureau of Labour Statistics data indicate there will be "1.4 million more software development jobs than applicants who can fill them by 2020...And there are more than 500,000 open computing jobs nationwide." An analysis by Glassdoor shows 9 of the 10 highest paying majors for US students 5 years out of college are in STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields, the report said. The report disputed the figures of the Trump administration that about 80 per cent of the H-1B workers are paid less than the median wage in their fields. "This statistic is misleading as it relies on a Department of Labour database that includes multiple applications for the same individuals, since a new filing is generally required when H-1B professional moves to a new area," the report said. That means it "double or triple counts anyone who works in more than one geographic location (primarily younger workers sent to multiple offices)." Moreover, it may not reflect what employers actually pay individual workers, only the minimum required to be listed for government filing purposes. The median salary in 2015 for H-1B computer-related recipients who have worked about three years (listed as "continuing employment" in DHS data) was about USD 7,000 higher than the median salary in the industry," the report said. The foundation argued that H-1B temporary visas are important as they are typically the only practical way a high-skilled foreign national working abroad or an international student educated in the United States can work longterm in America. At US universities, 77 per cent of the full-time graduate students in electrical engineering and 71 per cent in computer science are international students. Reforms to increase the labour mobility of H-1B visas, raise the employment-based green card quota and eliminate the per country limit would be welcome but are not currently on the agenda. New restrictions on high-skilled immigration are more likely, it said. "In today's global economy, companies and high-skilled professionals possess many options," said Anderson. "The United States should maintain an openness toward high-skilled immigration or those options likely will not be in America," he added.

Buy Home Insurance Indian IT woes: 37% drop in H-1B visas for top 7 firms in 2016, says report Companies experienced a drop of 5,436 approved petitions in 2016 as compared to previous year Companies experienced a drop of 5,436 approved petitions in 2016 as compared to previous year Top seven India-based IT companies in the US collectively experienced a whopping 37 per cent drop in approved H-1B visa petitions in 2016 as compared to the previous year, according to a new report that comes amid the Trump administration's crackdown on the "visa abuse". The companies experienced a drop of 5,436 approved petitions (37 per cent) in 2016 as compared to the previous year, said a report by the National Foundation for American Policy — a Washington-based non-profit think-tank. It said that the 9,356 new H-1B petitions for the top seven India-based companies approved in fiscal 2016 represent only 0.006 per cent of the US labour force. "While the threat of job loss has long been exaggerated by critics, it reaches illogical proportions when discussing fewer than 10,000 workers in an economy that employs 160 million workers nationwide," the National Foundation for American Policy said in a statement after releasing the report. The report comes after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order in April for tightening the rules of the H-1B visa programme to stop "visa abuses". Trump said his administration is going to enforce 'Hire American' rules that are designed to protect jobs and wages of workers in the US. The executive order also called upon the Departments of Labour, Justice, Homeland Security, and the state to take action against fraud and abuse of the US' visa programmes. According to the report, the number of approved new H-1B petitions for Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) declined by 56 per cent from FY 2015 to FY 2016, from 4,674 to 2,040, a drop of 2,634. For Wipro, the petitions declined by 52 per cent between FY 2015 and FY 2016, a drop of 1,605, going from 3,079 to 1,474 approved petitions for initial employment during those years. For Infosys, it declined by 16 per cent (or 454 petitions), with 2,376 approved H-1B petitions for initial employment in FY 2016, compared to 2,830 in FY 2015, said the report, which based its research on government data. "The drop in new H-1B visas for India-based companies, which is expected to continue when data are released on cases filed in April 2017 for FY 2018 start dates, is due to industry trends toward digital services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, which require fewer workers, and a choice by companies to rely less on visas and to build up their domestic workforces in the US," the report said. "H-1B petitions approved for initial employment in FY 2016 were filed by employers in April 2016, which means the drop in H-B visa use by these companies is not due to Donald Trump's election. "In the past, US policymakers have used the number of visas going to India-based companies as a political or policy reason to propose new immigration restrictions and to not raise the low annual supply of H-1B visas, which has been exhausted every year for the past 15 fiscal years," said NFAP executive director Stuart Anderson, former head of policy at the Immigration and Naturalisation Service under President George W Bush.

But has the Queensland government failed in its duty to be responsible with publicly owned resources such as coal? India's Adani looks to ship 40 million tonnes of coal a year in the mine's first phase from the Galilee Basin in Australia. Image: Shutterstock By Samantha Hepburn Wednesday 7 June 2017 Share this story Indian mining firm Adani yesterday announced that its board had approved plans to proceed with the controversial Carmichael coal mine in Queensland’s Galilee Basin. But it is still far from clear whether Adani has actually obtained the finance to proceed with the A$16.5 billion project, or whether it has secured the necessary A$1.1 billion loan from the government’s Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility needed for the mine’s railway. That hasn’t stopped the state government hailing the announcement as an economic win for Queensland, on the basis of job creation and for the signals it provides to potential investors in the region. But this amounts to little more than short-sighted politics. The government appears to be steadfastly ignoring the realities of the current energy landscape. Let’s recap: coal mining is not economically viable within the constraints of a global carbon budget, while renewable energy production is rapidly expanding as the world moves to more sustainable investments. The result is that coal projects could become stranded assets, with price tags that may already exceed what would have been the costs of a timely implementation of climate action. Investors and lending institutions are shifting to sustainable projects that limit the risk of catastrophic environmental damage. The people own the coal The state government owns the coal resource, but it is a special type of ownership. This is “public resource” ownership, meaning that all decisions made by the state government to exploit it must be in the interest of the public as a whole. Issuing resource titles that allow Adani to proceed with a vast coal mine – in defiance of the social, economic and environmental impacts of such a project within a carbon-constrained economy – arguably represents a dereliction of the state’s duty to act in the public interest. It also ignores the fact that in order to have just a 50 per cent chance of keeping global warming within 2℃, a key aim of the Paris climate agreement, 90 per cent of Australia’s current coal reserves must stay in the ground. If the mine proceeds, it will contribute substantially to global warming and accelerate the destruction of one of the world’s greatest natural assets, the Great Barrier Reef. This could have huge knock-on effects for future tourism in the area, which generates A$6 billion a year. The economics of the Adani coal mine simply do not make sense. While there may be limited short-term employment opportunities and royalty gains for the state should the project actually get financed, the longer-term projections are dire. The thermal coal market is in decline. What’s more, the Carmichael mine will produce low-ranking thermal coal with a high ash content, making it carbon-intensive even by coal’s standards, and bringing with it considerable health risks. With this in mind, it seems short-sighted to subsidise an anticipated production of between 25 million and 60 million tonnes of coal a year. Put simply, coal is not a sustainable resource for energy production. “ Let’s recap: coal mining is not economically viable within the constraints of a global carbon budget, while renewable energy production is rapidly expanding as the world moves to more sustainable investments.  This climate perspective informs the market. India, for example, cannot be relied upon as a guaranteed market for this low-quality coal. This is particularly evident in the recent unveiling of India’s new power plan, which calls for a dramatic increase in renewable energy production. This will have a deleterious impact on all Australian coal markets, and makes the decision to pursue low-quality coal reserves all the more untenable. The banks know this. Westpac, ANZ, NAB, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, Citi, BNP Paribas, Société Générale and Crédit Agricole are among the domestic and international banks that have declined to fund the project, while the Commonwealth Bank has quit as the project’s financial adviser. This is why the question of financing is so fraught. The major banks understand the fact that longer term, the Adani coal mine has no future. They are also concerned about the financial impact of stranded assets. Westpac, for example, made it very clear earlier this year that it aims to shift lending to sustainable economic models, and would increase lending to this sector to A$25 billion by 2030. It also made it clear that any funding for coal projects would henceforth be limited to existing coal projects with high-quality coal. Other major banks have adopted similar stances. Where next? So what happens now? The government may decide to fund Adani’s railway, but that does not necessarily mean the mine itself will ever actually move forward. If and when Adani’s project does fall over, consideration should be given to whether the government should be held accountable for breaching public interest responsibilities in issuing the resource titles in the first place. Of course, this necessarily presumes the financing for the Adani mine will actually proceed. To reiterate, there is no evidence that this has actually occurred. Getting government approval, and a green light from one’s own board, does not mean that Adani actually has the funding required to go ahead and dig the coal. In the end, the real question is whether any lending institution will seriously take a risk on this vast and irresponsible project, which ignores both the safety of the Great Barrier Reef and the fundamentals of carbon-constrained economics.

All bar two of the 50 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect the Reserve Bank of India to keep the repurchase rate at 6.25 percent on Wednesday. Two economists expect a cut in the repo as well as the reverse repo rate as inflationary pressures cool and growth drops to it slowest pace in two years. None expect any change in the cash reserve ratio. If Governor Urjit Patel cuts rates, he will take the repo rate to its lowest in over six years and will continue a string of surprises that he and the monetary policy committee have sprung on investors since taking over in September last year. In April, the monetary policy committee raised the reverse repo rate in a bid to tighten liquidity conditions after having shifted to a neutral stance in February, ending a two-year easing cycle. In December, when almost everyone was expecting the central bank to cut rates after an unprecedented cash ban hurt activity, Patel held rates. And in October, while chairing his first MPC meeting, Patel cut interest rates even though a majority were expecting him to stand pat. "Growth and investment need to improve -- these are indicators which are available," Arun Jaitley, finance minister, said in a statement to CNBC TV earlier this week. "Any finance minister under these circumstances would like a rate cut, the private sector would like a rate cut. But then when you entrusted it with the MPC, I would rather wait for their decision." The monetary authority will announce its decision at 2:30 p.m. in Mumbai followed by a press conference 15 minutes later. Slowing Inflation Patel had said in April that although headline inflation may come under target in the near term, the outlook for consumer prices called for " close vigilance". Other monetary policy members also remained concerned about inflation, minutes from the meeting showed in April. Over the medium term, the central bank aims to keep inflation around 4 percent and has said that core inflation -- which strips out volatile food and fuel costs -- has been sticky. According to economists at ICICI Bank, India’s largest private sector bank by assets, core CPI inflation rose 4.5 percent in April from a year earlier, which was slightly lower than the 4.8 percent rise seen in the year to March 2017. Headline retail prices have also slowed. Consumer prices rose 2.99 percent in April from a year earlier, down from 3.89 percent in March and below the 4.5 percent inflation rate the RBI forecast for April to September, dragged down by lower food prices. A 5.5 percent rise in the rupee this year is also driving down the cost of imports and keeping inflationary expectations anchored. All in all, inflation has consistently undershot RBI forecasts, leading to speculation that the central bank may lower rates in coming months if price pressures soften further. "With inflation expected to undershoot forecasts, we believe the space for modest easing is opening up later in the year," JP Morgan Chase &Co. economists Sajjid Chinoy and Toshi Jain wrote in a note. "We have penciled in a 25 bps cut later in the year, perhaps as early as the August review." Growth Pangs The drop in inflation comes at a time when growth is slowing as an unprecedented cash ban imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi bites. The latest data shows the economy has been slowing even before the note ban, bolstering a view that it might need a dose of monetary stimulus to help revive activity. Gross domestic product expanded by 6.1 percent in the January to March quarter, the slowest in two years and undershooting economists forecasts in a Bloomberg survey by a full percentage point. The economy grew 7.1 percent for the fiscal year ended in March, down from 8 percent in the previous year. A private sector survey released last week also showed the factory sector slowing in May from a month earlier. Looming over the economy is also the introduction of a national goods and services tax, scheduled for July 1, which could cause short-term disruption to activity. Standard Chartered Plc’s economists Anubhuti Sahay and Kanika Pasricha wrote in a note that they expect economic activity to be subdued and have pencilled only a marginal improvement in GDP growth to 7.3 percent in the financial year 2018 from 7.1 percent in the previous year. Nevertheless, the RBI is expected to sound optimistic and would expect growth to pick up in the rest of the year. A normal monsoon is poised to boost rural incomes while increased government spending, and higher allowances for workers in the public sector may bolster activity and consumption in the $2 trillion economy. Zombie Debt While India’s is still expected to remain one of the fastest growing major economies in the world, there is a significant risk it needs to overcome: a mountain of bad debt at the nation’s banks, especially in state-run banks. Soured loans have contributed to a $191 billion pile of zombie debt, or nearly 8 percent of GDP and cast the future of some lenders in doubt and curbed investment by businesses. The quantity of new loans that over-leveraged businesses are willing to take and that under-provisioned banks are willing to give, is slowing, dragging credit growth to its lowest in atleast 25 years. Investment by private companies actually started to shrink in the year through March and will, by the government’s estimate, contract by more than 7 percent this financial year. The tardy demand for credit along with a deluge in bank deposits after the cash ban has left the RBI grappling with excess funds. "In our view, this is an opportune time to keep the rate discussions on the sidelines and focus more on pressing issues such as non-performing loans resolution in public sector banks and the surplus liquidity in the banking system," said Kaushik Das, chief economist at Deutsche Bank.

Research shows that 60 percent of the CEOs don't have a single professional account or channel on any of six major social media platforms.(The Associated Press) By The Washington Post WASHINGTON -- The nation's chief executive may be irrepressible on Twitter, using it to declare the Russia investigation a "witch hunt," sound off about "fake news" or negative press "covfefe," and bash London's mayor for his response to the city's terror attack. But CEOs of most Fortune 500 companies are less enthused, with a recent report showing that use of social-media platforms by Fortune 500 CEOs flat-lined in 2016. Sixty percent of these CEOs of America's largest public companies don't have a single professional account or channel on any of six major social media platforms, the report finds, and just 36 of the Fortune 500 CEOs have Twitter accounts, down from 50 last year. Of those, only 25 are active. The report, done by business software company Domo and its site CEO.com, also reported smaller total numbers of Fortune 500 CEOs with a professional Facebook page in 2016, while the number of them on LinkedIn, where many are "influencers" who can post messages about their companies, ticked up. According to the report, 181 Fortune 500 CEOs were on LinkedIn last year, a safer "on-ramp" to social media for CEOs. The report identified the social profiles of every CEO on the Fortune 500 list across six major platforms (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, Instagram and YouTube) and scrubbed any accounts that weren't credible. Private personal accounts were not included, a Domo spokesperson said. Leslie Gaines-Ross, the chief reputation strategist for Weber Shandwick, which also issues a report on CEOs and their social media use, says LinkedIn is more popular among CEOs in part because commenters can't be anonymous. As a professional-oriented site, the commentary is also usually more tame. "It's a bit of a safer platform if you have a thin skin," she said. Facebook, meanwhile, can help humanize a CEO, and Twitter is particularly important for CEOs navigating bad news or a reputation issue, as well as to share views or statements they hope will go viral. "It seems to be the platform of choice when you're in a crisis," she says, with a message that "gets out quickly and immediately. It has its own advantages." The report also named the most followed CEOs in 2016 on certain platforms. At the time of its research at the end of last year, Apple's Tim Cook had the most Twitter followers, while Warren Buffett's nine tweets had been the most retweeted. BlackRock's Larry Fink and JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon had the most followers on their LinkedIn Influencer pages, the report said. Gaines-Ross said founders tend to be more active than CEOs-for-hire. But she would have thought more big-company CEOs would have their own professional social-media accounts, as it's become such a pervasive way for companies -- and the people who are their public face - to recruit people, interact with customers, tout company news and offer a view into what they do all day. "It's important for CEOs to have some participation in social media," she says. "That's where your customers are. That's where the talent is." Some CEOs, of course, are avid Twitter users, such as Salesforce's Marc Benioff, who tweets frequently about everything from company conferences to state-level "bathroom bill" legislation. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has been known to troll short sellers of his stock on Twitter, announce his departure from Trump's advisory council after the president's Paris accord exit, and even respond to a question about his underwear. "Wearing anything at all is just a conspiracy by the capitalist running dogs of Big Underwear" - Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 5, 2017. As for why more CEOs of big companies don't use social media, the report cited public mentions of CEOs saying they're too busy -- or they don't understand its return on investment -- as reasons they were staying off the platforms, rather than fears or concerns about making any big mistakes. "I think CEOs and their communications people have learned a lot of the lessons about what's safe and what's not safe," Gaines-Ross said. "We don't really see a lot of big gaffes out there by Fortune 500 CEOs on social media." To be sure, CEOs do tend to have teams of people who approve their tweets or social media messages, even if they are involved in the process, to help them avoid a late night mistake that gets them into trouble. "There's usually a team behind it," Gaines-Ross said, who may aid in crafting messages or can help "just to check the spelling -- at least." -- The Washington Post  View Comments About Us About OregonLive.com Our Journalists Contact the newsroom Join our team Frequently Asked Questions Subscriber Services Advertise with us Subscribe Today The Oregonian Email Newsletters Already a Subscriber Manage your Subscription Delivery Feedback Place a vacation hold Make a payment OregonLive.com Sections News Business Sports High School Sports Entertainment Opinion Legal Notices Obituaries Videos Weather Sitemap & search Your Regional News Pages Clackamas County Gresham Portland Washington County Mobile iPhone, Android apps | Tablet Apps More on OregonLive.com Classifieds Jobs Autos Rentals Real Estate Post a job Post a classified ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Sponsor Content Local Deals Follow Us Twitter | Facebook | Google+ | Pinterest | Instagram | Tumblr Registration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement and Privacy Policy © 2017 Oregon Live LLC.

All bar two of the 50 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect the Reserve Bank of India to keep the repurchase rate at 6.25 percent on Wednesday. Two economists expect a cut in the repo as well as the reverse repo rate as inflationary pressures cool and growth drops to it slowest pace in two years.

Investment by private companies actually started to shrink in the year through March and will, by the government’s estimate, contract by more than 7 percent this financial year. The tardy demand for credit along with a deluge in bank deposits after the cash ban has left the RBI grappling with excess funds. "In our view, this is an opportune time to keep the rate discussions on the sidelines and focus more on pressing issues such as non-performing loans resolution in public sector banks and the surplus liquidity in the banking system," said Kaushik Das, chief economist at Deutsche Bank.

BUSINESS Vodafone cracks down on Google and Facebook 7 Jun, 2017 11:44am 6 minutes to read × Vodafone will be cracking down on advertising with Facebook and Google. Photo / File Daily Telegraph UK Share via email Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Show more Bookmark this article Share on Facebook facebook Share on Twitter twitter Share via email email Share on LinkedIn linkedin Share on Google Plus google-plus Share on Whatsapp whatsapp Share on Pinterest pinterest Share on Reddit reddit × Vodafone, one of the world's biggest advertising spenders, will crack down on fake news and extremist material online, challenging Google and Facebook to cut off the flow of money to "abusive and damaging" outlets. The telecoms giant, which is understood to spend nearly £400 million ($719m) a year on digital advertising out of a total budget of £750m, unveiled new rules it said will protect its brand from appearing alongside material that is "fundamentally at odds" with its "values and beliefs as a company". To participate in Vodafone campaigns, online networks including Google and Facebook will have to place its advertising only on outlets that have been pre-approved as highly unlikely to be focused on fake news or hate speech. They "must take all measures necessary to ensure that Vodafone advertising does not appear within hate speech and fake news outlets", the company added. The new policy makes Vodafone, which spends its online advertising budget in the UK via the WPP agency MEC, the biggest name yet to move to a so-called whitelisting approach across the board. Previously rogue websites and channels on services such as YouTube were often blacklisted, but there has been mounting concern that fake news and extremist material have become too prevalent to monitor.

"As one of the largest brands in New Zealand and globally we know we must take a stand on issues that are important to our people; customers, staff and shareholders, and to society," said Vodafone New Zealand consumer director Matt Williams. "Fortunately the New Zealand media landscape has not seen the sorts of hate speech and fake news outlets that have become common in some of our other markets, so in New Zealand the whitelist is fairly comprehensive. However we have taken steps to ensure that digital networks which distribute our advertising to specific international outlets must declare all those websites for our review in order to be included on our whitelist," Williams said. Vodafone Group chief executive Vittorio Colao said: "Hate speech and fake news threaten to undermine the principles of respect and trust that bind communities together. Vodafone has a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion; we also greatly value the integrity of the democratic processes and institutions that are often the targets of purveyors of fake news. We will not tolerate our brand being associated with this kind of abusive and damaging content." The company said outlets will not be allowed on its whitelist if their main purpose is to disseminate material intended to degrade women or vulnerable minorities. Satire and opinion will be allowed, but fake news websites that deliberately intend to mislead readers will be excluded. Vodafone also highlighted that its policy specifically bars any attempt to threaten to withdraw advertising from outlets that criticise the company. It comes amid growing anger over the placement of major brand advertising alongside YouTube videos posted by Isis supporters and allegations that the video service is facilitating the funding of terrorism, as its contributors receive a share of revenues. Anti-semitic videos on YouTube, which is owned by Google, have run alongside advertising from Land Rover and the insurer Axa. In March the Government suspended advertising on YouTube after its campaigns were placed alongside extremist videos. Eric Schmidt, chairman of Google's parent company Alphabet, has admitted that its advertising algorithms and blacklists cannot completely protect brands from extremist material. Google "can't guarantee it but we can get pretty close", he said. Vodafone has been working on its stricter new approach to extremist material and fake news for eight months, since around the time of the US election. Debate over the impact of fake news on the unsuccessful Hillary Clinton campaign has raged. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg initially dismissed its influence, before introducing new reporting tools to discourage its spread on the social network. American brands including Kellogg's have blacklisted the controversial right-wing website Breitbart, which has links to the Trump administration and has been accused of championing discrimination and conspiracy theories. Breitbart rejects the allegations. Commercial concerns are also in play for advertisers seeking to increase the efficiency of their spending. Big brands have registered growing concern abut the effectiveness of online advertising networks, which can spread campaigns across tens of thousands of outlets. A study in by the US retail bank JP Morgan Chase slashed the number of websites its advertising appeared on from about 400,000 to a whitelist of only about 5000, with no apparent impact on custom. The ineffectiveness of advertising networks is also understood to have played a role in Vodafone's decision. The shift will be welcomed by major news publishers, who are likely to receive a boost in income as more brands adopt a whitelisting approach that will divide their budgets across fewer outlets. They will also hope it will mean news publishers get a greater share of online advertising growth. Google and Facebook's dominance has been increasing, threatening efforts to replace declining print revenues. It follows a potential boost for publishers in the Conservative manifesto, which pledged to ensure "there is a sustainable business model for high-quality media online, to create a level playing field for our media and creative industries". A Vodafone source said its new policy partly signalled "a return to the old days, where we know the publications that are going to be hosting our brand". Vodafone's decision was also welcomed in the television industry, which is also seeking to stem the flow of spending to digital players. Sky chief operating officer Andrew Griffith said: "This just reinforces the return to TV advertising with its enduring strength of being a highly regulated, transparent and brand-safe environment along with the additional benefit of supporting local jobs and paying substantial taxes." Lindsey Clay, chief executive of the television advertising lobby Thinkbox, added: "Most people don't want to hang out with racists, extremists or liars in the shady corners of dodgy parties. Brands are no different. "It is good news that brands are taking this issue so seriously and the media industry should welcome Vodafone's move."

They have been shunned by foreign exchange users following the convergence of naira/dollar rates at the parallel market  and BDCs for the first time in two years. The exchange rate at both parallel market and BDCs closed yesterday at N363/$1. The attractive rate at the parallel market immediately triggered a massive influx of demands from forex users running away from the mandatory regulatory documentations sought by BDCs. Aminu Gwadabe, president, Association of Bureaux De Change Operators of Nigeria (ABCON) who confirmed the rates, said BDCs were at a disadvantage, as forex users shunned them for the parallel market where they could buy without documentation. “Many forex users prefer to buy at the parallel market instead of BDCs because there are no longer rate gaps. They prefer the parallel market where there is no single documentation required. That is why we are calling on the CBN to review the rate band for BDCs,” he said. Gwadabe said the challenges faced by BDCs, if not checked,  would trigger a liquidity crisis that may derail the ongoing recovery of the naira against the dollar. “We want the CBN to review the BDC rate to ensure that currency speculators do not return to the market. Remember the BDCs buy dollar at N360/$1 from the CBN,” he said. Gwadabe said the BDCs helped the CBN to checkmate the activities of black market operators and should be supported to remain in business. The gap between official and black market rates started to shrink since February 20, when the CBN resumed dollar interventions in key segments of the economy. The feat was achieved after the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) pumped over $5 billion in the last four months into the interbank, BDCs, wholesale spot and forwards auction segments of the market. Analysts said the introduction of a new foreign exchange window for investors and exporters targeted at increasing forex supply in the market and allowing the timely settlement of transactions helped achieve the current exchange rate. “So far, approximately $1 billion has been traded at this window. The spread between the parallel and interbank markets narrowed to N76.15 (May 30th) compared to N83.65 as at April 28th,” Bismarck Rewane, an economist said in an emailed report. He said the naira at the parallel market appreciated by 2.63 per cent to close at N380/$ as at May 30th, compared to N390/$ in April. At the interbank market, the naira gained marginally by 0.16 per cent to close at N305.90/$ from N306.85/$ in April. This was mainly driven by the new forex policies and regular intervention in the market by the CBN. “We expect the naira to appreciate further in the coming month due to the CBN’s increased dollar sale to BDCs, the intervention for SMEs and favorable forex policy for investors, exporters and end-users. The threat to this is the uncertainty surrounding oil prices. Oil prices fell below $50pb in May before recovering to $52pb. Nonetheless, any further decline in oil prices could deplete the external reserves level, and hinder the CBN’s ability to intervene as frequently as possible,” he said. But JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Renaissance Capital have said the naira rally, sparked by increased sales of foreign-exchange forwards and looser capital controls, are contingent on the CBN continuing to sell down its foreign reserves. The Nigeria’s gross external reserves decreased by 1.19 per cent ($37 million) to $30.49 billion as at May 25th from $30.86 billion recorded at the end of April. The CBN on Monday injected $190 million into the inter-bank market. At the trading, the bank offered  $100 million as wholesale interventions and allocated  $50 million to the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) forex window. Customers requiring forex for Business/Personal Travel Allowances, tuition and medical fees, among others, got $40 million. CBN spokesman Isaac Okorafor, said the bank was pleased at the performance of the naira, which had made tremendous gain against the dollar in recent times. Okorafor observed that by ensuring transparency in the market as well as fairness to end-users, the CBN had further exposed speculators and checkmated them. He urged all dealers, particularly licensed BDCs, to continue to play by the rule, adding that the CBN would not hesitate to wield the big stick against any erring bank or dealer.

At least 7 percent of the company will be offered through a combination of new and existing shares owned by billionaire Suleiman Kerimov’s family, according to a statement on Monday. Some of the shares will be traded as global depository receipts on the London Stock Exchange, marking a return to the city for Polyus, which withdrew its listing two years ago. “Polyus really has top-quality assets, which is good for the deal,” George Buzhenitsa, analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, said by phone. “The only thing is that investors will remember the parent company’s past history of delisting.” The miner’s parent, Polyus Gold International Ltd., delisted from London in late 2015 after the Kerimov family, which controls the company, bought up shares as part of a plan to domicile in Russia. The company is now selling stock to meet Moscow Exchange requirements that it needs more freely traded shares to retain a primary listing. Currently, only about 7 percent of the shares are available on the Russian market. The price range is expected to be announced around June 16, and the deal may close at the end of the month, according to two people familiar with the company’s plans. The share sale may increase depending on demand and price, they said, asking not to be identified because the details aren’t public. The stake is worth about $700 million based on Friday’s closing price and Polyus expects to receive $400 million of proceeds. In April, people familiar with the matter said the company had planned to sell up to a 10 percent stake. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Sberbank PJSC, VTB Capital, BMO Capital Markets, Gazprombank PJSC and Morgan Stanley are organizing the deal. Many Russian firms have pulled out of international markets in recent years due to sanctions, low commodity prices and government backing to move listings to Moscow. Since the end of last year, share sales in both Moscow and London began to return as raw-material markets and Russia’s economy recovered. "We don’t see any real alternative for Russian players as a platform for additional listing despite the fact there are other potential exchanges like Toronto or Hong Kong," Pavel Grachev, CEO of Polyus, said in an interview in St. Petersburg on June 1. "London Stock Exchange will definitely remain the main platform after Moscow Exchange." Read more: Russian mining tycoons eye return to London market Separately on May 31, the Kerimov family agreed to sell a 10 percent stake in Polyus to a group led by China’s Fosun International Ltd. The deal valued Polyus at $9 billion and has an option that allows the stake to increase by 5 percent, which would put the worth at $10 billion. The Kremlin-backed Russian Direct Investment Fund also bought 0.3 percent of Polyus last week. The company has proved and probable gold reserves of 71 million ounces, according to a statement released today, making it the world’s second-biggest producer by attributable reserves after Barrick Gold Corp. Polyus estimated spending on its Sukhoi Log gold deposit as high as $2.5 billion through 2025, according to the prospectus for the share offering. The ore reserves at the deposit, which the company bought this year, have not yet been estimated. This year, capital expenditures for the whole group are seen at $781 million. The miner also declared a $354 million dividend on Monday.
