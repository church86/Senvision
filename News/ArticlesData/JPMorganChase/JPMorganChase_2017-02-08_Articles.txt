US households, on average, wait until they get an increase in income before paying for a major medical expense. Major medical expenses lead to long-term increases in credit-card debt and lower income and liquid assets. Out-of-pocket healthcare costs in the US are among the fastest-growing expenses for Americans, and they can be devastating. JPMorgan Chase looked at the data of 250,000 banking customers to study their financial habits, and found just how difficult paying for a large medical expense can be. According to the findings, families typically wait until they get a bump in income before they pay for a major medical expense. In the month before a major expense, incomes were 4% higher than average for households. Other discretionary expenses also increased the month before. "This might suggest that some families delayed health care expenses until they had extra income to spend, and when they did so, they also increased expenses in other categories," the report said. As we've reported previously, households have cited medical expenses as one of their most demanding financial burdens, and 12% of Americans deferred seeing a doctor because of the costs in the last year. Income and spending weren't the only things to increase around a large medical payment, according to JPMorgan Chase. Families also built up their borrowing around that time to finance the payments. "When a major medical payment occurred, in aggregate, families experienced changes in not just their income and expenses but also their liquid assets and borrowing," the report said. "This was often by necessity—the $163 increase in income (4 percent relative to baseline, in aggregate) would not have been sufficient to fully pay for a major medical payment that was at least $400 and $2,089 on average." health spending changes COTDMore (JP Morgan Chase Institute) The changes in preparation for a medical expense also differed by income level, according to the study: "Specifically, families in the lowest asset tercile increased their liquid assets by 14 percent ($1,102), compared to 8 percent ($869) among the middle tercile, and just 3 percent ($891) among the highest tercile prior to the major medical payment (Figure 20). This suggests that families with lower total assets were more likely to have been liquidity-constrained prior to the medical payment and were either paying off outstanding medical bills or had left a medical condition untreated until they were able to pay for the out-of-pocket expenses." One explanation for this is that the uninsured rate for low-income families is typically higher. So more of these costs are coming out of pocket, rather than through coverage, and require more planning. According to the "National Health Interview Survey," the government's premier survey on insurance statistics, 24.7% of "near poor" Americans go without insurance versus just 6.5% of "not poor" persons. Perhaps the most startling statistic from the JPMorgan Chase findings is the length of time it takes for families to recover from the large medical expense. "A year after a major medical payment families had not fully recovered financially relative to the baseline," the research found. "In aggregate, comparing 12 months after the medical payment to the baseline period, income was 3 percent ($112) lower, non-medical expenses were 1 percent ($56) lower, liquid assets were 2 percent lower ($410), and revolving balance was 9 percent ($217) higher." Of note, according to JPMorgan Chase, is that the decline in income and nonmedical expenses also indicates that the expenses show "major medical payments were associated with lasting changes in families’ financial well being."

Grant | @kelligrant Thursday, 9 Feb 2017 | 12:45 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Here’s the 411 on how to kick-start your emergency fund    Monday, 24 Oct 2016 | 8:30 AM ET | 01:28 Better start building that emergency fund. Earlier this year, a Bankrate.com report found that just 41 percent of Americans could draw from savings to cover a $500 emergency. The problem? That's a pretty minor bill as far as emergencies go. In a given year, 40 percent of families face an "extraordinary payment" of roughly $1,500 to cover an unexpected medical, auto repair or tax bill, according to a new analysis from JPMorgan Chase Institute. The bank assessed anonymized account data from 25,000 Chase checking account customers between January 2013 and December 2015. Tax time is the worst season for unexpected expenses — and not just for tax bills. JPMorgan Chase Institute data found that March and April are the most common months for extraordinary medical expenses. "Even with more money in their pocket from tax refunds, the strain of major and unexpected medical costs are hitting families hard and making it difficult for them to recover," Diana Farrell, president and chief executive officer of the JPMorgan Chase Institute, said in the press release. A year after an emergency medical payment, 48 percent of families still had depleted savings and 33 percent still had elevated credit card debt, the report found. Financial advisors typically recommend setting aside three to six months' worth of living expenses, although some families may benefit from having even more saved. That can be a daunting target, but even having a little bit set aside can mean you rely less on credit to cover an emergency, said Bruce McClary, a spokesman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. "One of the things that people need to consider in this situation is that you have to start somewhere," he said. Assess your budget and look for room to save even small amounts, McClary said. Set up recurring contributions from your paycheck into a savings account to help reinforce the habit. And if you do get a windfall, such as a bonus or a tax refund, save at least some of that money to help create a safety net. show chapters Beefing up your emergency fund    Friday, 3 Oct 2014 | 8:58 AM ET | 00:50 Kelli B.

Now, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is adding another unwelcome element: banking fees. In a handful of jurisdictions, the biggest U.S. bank by assets handles administration of the juror-compensation system, issuing debit cards instead of the age-old system of paper checks. In addition to the juror pay, the cards also come loaded with fees — for balance inquiries, for inactivity, for using non-Chase ATMs, for charges with insufficient funds and for cash or check issuance. The funds become impossible to withdraw from an ATM once the balance falls below $20, and in at least one jurisdiction — Washington, D.C. — there are no Chase branches or ATMs within 90 miles (145 kilometers), ensuring the funds will eventually be frittered away to the bank. IMAGE: Bloomberg News William Mark Scott, a lawyer who served on a jury in Washington last year, sued JPMorgan, accusing it of unjust enrichment and violation of the Consumer Protection Act. He’s seeking to represent all other jurors who were paid with JPMorgan debit cards. "Chase uses its monopolistic control over juror funds to steal captive jurors’ money by assessing unconscionable and deceptive fees," Scott claims. "By making it prohibitively expensive to receive an over-the-counter cash withdrawal from, or to receive a check drawn upon the debit card, Chase ensures a ‘rump’ balance will be left on each debit card -- and forfeited." Tasha Pelio, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to immediately comment on the lawsuit. It’s the second time in two years that Chase has been accused of taking advantage of captive customers. In 2015, thousands of ex-convicts said Chase charged predatory fees through debit cards issued to people leaving prison. The cards held prison pay and commissary balances. Chase took over distribution of prisoner pay under a contract with the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Chase paid almost $450,000 to settle the lawsuit. For local courts, having a big bank come in and take over the juror-pay system was welcome relief. The cost of overseeing the system and cutting checks is time-consuming and expensive. In some jurisdictions, budget liabilities swelled into the tens of thousands of dollars as some jurors didn’t bother to cash or deposit checks. The full scope of JPMorgan’s juror pay program is unclear. Washington, Livingston County, Michigan, and Gwinnett County, Georgia, have adopted it, according to a Google search. Fort Bend County, Texas, also considered it but it is unclear if it went into effect there. JPMorgan doesn’t appear to disclose any information about the program in its financial statements. The bank announced in 2014 that it would exit the pre-paid card business, but continues to administer the program in jurisdictions where it is still under contract. Scott said in his lawsuit that he served in July on a superior court jury in Washington D.C., which pays $30 a day and $4 daily for travel. He got a Chase debit card and was twice charged 25 cents for not having sufficient funds when making a purchase. He was also twice charged $1.50 for inactivity. With about $13 left on the card, he has few ways of using it and expects it to be eventually eaten by fees. "If there is, in fact, any way for jurors to use or withdraw their rump balances, Chase conceals this in order to milk more fees from them," he claimed in the lawsuit. "Indeed, Chase expects and relies on individuals forfeiting these funds to the bank." The case is Scott v JPMorgan Chase & Co., 17-cv-249, U.S. District Court for District of Columbia (Washington).

According to the research firm, 50 Kcal per Kg decline in Coal GCV (gross calorific value), if not passed on, may impact earnings by 6 percent and decline in interest rate may lead CERC (Central Electricity Regulatory Commission) to cut FY20-24 regulated return on equity (RoE). BoAML built 100 bps interest rate cut in regulated return on equity to 14.5 percent.

While retaining buy rating on the stock, with a target of Rs 1,200, CLSA says it sees a strong turnaround over next two years. Citi says Bharat Forge's Q3 revenue was 5 percent above estimates driven by domestic business.

Kotak expects standalone revenue to grow at 17 percent CAGR over FY17-19. It feels valuations are expensive; hence it retained sell rating on the stock, with increased target at Rs 900 (from Rs 810). Cipla With assigning neutral rating on Cipla, with a target price at Rs 575, JPMorgan says Q3 results were in-line and ramp-up in US was key for margin expansion. Cost control & lower R&D were key drivers of higher EBITDA and R&D execution was key for US ramp-up, it adds. CLSA feels pick-up in US sales looks critical for improved profitability in FY18. The brokerage house has retained outperform rating on the stock, with target price at Rs 645. Deutsche Bank feels it was a weak quarter and operating leverage is yet to play out. It retained hold rating on the stock, with target at Rs 550, while cutting FY17 EPS to factor in the Q3 miss. Nomura has downgraded Cipla to neutral, with increased target at Rs 665 (from Rs 605).

Indraprastha Gas ICICI Securities has downgraded IGL to hold from add but raised FY17 EPS by 8 percent & target price by 15 percent to Rs 1,015.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Feb 8, 2017 at 8:20PM The future of fintech is bright, almost blindingly so, but many of the entrepreneurs in the industry fail to grasp what will eventually lead to the downfall of countless fintech firms, particularly those that lend money. An unhealthy obsession with "yes" There's a belief among technology-based lenders that the goal should always be to say "yes." If someone needs money, it's less about whether that person or business is a good credit risk than it is about the customer experience and the length of time it will take the borrower to access their funds. The homepage of LendingClub (NYSE:LC) advertises personal loans of up to $40,000. You can "apply online in minutes" and "get funded in as little as a few days," the company says. Another prominent fintech lender Funding Circle claims that small businesses can get loans from between $25,000 and $500,000 in as little as 10 days. These are innovative services that seek to fill important niches in the credit markets. They enable people who have historically been shunned by banks to get loans in order to expand their businesses or to pay off credit card debt at less usurious rates. But even good ideas can be taken too far. It's on this note that fintech lenders can learn a lot from the history of banking. And the most important lesson of all revolves around the frequent need to say "no." Digging into the history of banking will one day prove invaluable to fintech investors. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Those who forget history... The credit cycle is the most powerful force in finance. Credit expands at a voracious rate when times are good. But it then contracts with such suddenness and viciousness that anyone who isn't prepared for the turn will be crucified on the cross of credit, similar to the 17,000 banks that have failed since the Civil War. Lenders get overconfident when the economy is ascending. They convince themselves and those around them that this time is different; that they've finally cracked the nut on protecting their institutions against widespread default. Warren Buffett refers to this as the institutional imperative, which he defines as "the tendency of executives to mindlessly imitate the behavior of their peers, no matter how foolish it may be to do so." Buffett wrote this in the early 1990s, just as the credit cycle came crashing down on an entire generation of lenders who had convinced themselves that credit risk was a thing of the past. "In their lending, many bankers played follow-the-leader with lemming-like zeal, now they are experiencing a lemming-like fate," Buffett continued. We've seen tendencies like these emerge time and again throughout history. In the 1980s, investment managers believed that so-called portfolio insurance had eradicated the risk of owning stocks -- a close cousin of bonds and thus merely an alternative type of credit. It only became clear how naive this was once people realized that portfolio insurance had actually accelerated the market crash on October 19, 1987 -- so-called Black Monday. The same was true in the lead-up to the financial crisis of 2008. Lenders had convinced themselves that mortgage-backed securities and credit default swaps offered ironclad protection against a downturn in the housing market. This liberated them to lend money to all comers irrespective of income, assets, and credit history. We all know how that story ended. This is why the best bankers, those like JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) Jamie Dimon, are obsessed with risk and humble in the face of the credit cycle. "No one has the right to not assume that the business cycle will turn," implored Dimon on the eve of the last crisis. "Every five years or so, you have got to assume that something bad will happen." This is also why investors and entrepreneurs should recoil whenever they hear leaders of fintech companies insinuate that they've neutralized credit risk once and for all. Take this claim from ZestFinance, an online lender that applies "Google-like math" to make credit decisions: This new technology is able to consume vast amounts of data to more accurately identify good borrowers -- enabling higher repayment rates for lenders and lower-cost credit for consumers. At ZestFinance, there is no human interaction of any kind involved in underwriting. Instead, we rely on several mathematical models running in parallel to make underwriting decisions. While many creditors take hours, or even days, to make credit decisions, we make them -- accurately -- in less than 10 seconds. This lack of humility is a mistake. While there's always the possibility that ZestFinance has truly tamed credit risk for the first time in thousands of years of lending, there are entire graveyards filled with companies that have said the same thing throughout history. Tempering dogma with reality The idea that credit should flow swiftly and freely is laudable, but it must be tempered with reality. Banks are retail operations that sell money, a commodity that anyone would want at the right time and at the right price. When it comes to credit, in turn, it's often more noble and responsible to say "no" than it is to say "yes." "It's a well-known maxim that one of the hardest things about running a business is to maintain the ability to say no and thereby save limited resources for the best opportunities," writes Duff McDonald in his biography of JPMorgan Chase's Dimon. "Over time, most companies simply lose their discipline." The same point was made by Fred Schwed, Jr. in his classic satire of Wall Street Where Are the Customers' Yachts?: The conservative banker is an impressive specimen, diffusing the healthy glow which comes of moderation in eating, living, and thinking. He sits in state and spends his days saying, with varying inflections and varying contexts, 'no.' ... He says 'yes' only a few times a year. His rule is that he reserves his yesses for organizations so wealthy that if he said 'no,' some other banker would quickly say 'yes.' His business might be defined as the lending of money exclusively to people who have no pressing need of it. This seems insensitive and exclusionary, but there's more than a grain of truth to it. Just ask the hundreds of banks that failed in the wake of the financial crisis after convincing themselves that credit risk had been eradicated from the face of the earth. Embracing strategic inefficiency The key to avoiding this fate is to embrace inefficiency, albeit to a careful and conscious extent. It's on this score that claims from fintech companies (such as LendingClub, ZestFinance, and to a lesser extent Lending Tree (NASDAQ:TREE)) about rapidly approving loans to people that they've never met in person is so concerning to anyone with any knowledge of the ceaselessly undulating waves of the credit cycle. More than a century ago, one of the two namesakes of JPMorgan Chase, John Pierpont Morgan, was asked during a Congressional hearing if commercial credit was based on money or property. "No sir. The first thing is character," Morgan responded. The inquisitor persisted: "Before money or property?" To which Morgan responded: "Before money or property or anything else. Money cannot buy it ... because a man I do not trust could not get money from me on all the bonds in Christendom." It's tempting for fintech entrepreneurs to reject this as outdated advice. After all, we no longer lumber around in horses and buggies like Morgan did. The Pony Express has since been replaced by the telegraph, which was later replaced by the telephone. Penicillin wasn't discovered until 15 years after Morgan uttered these words. And, of course, we now have the internet and big data. "Since the modern credit system was created in the 1950's, the world has changed," claims ZestFinance. "Technology has changed. So should credit." But the truth is that credit hasn't changed, or at least not as much as statements like these might otherwise lead one to believe. Technology can assist in the underwriting process, but it isn't a panacea that renders credit risk obsolete. More specifically, technology shouldn't be viewed as a substitute for assessing character, which is admittedly an inefficient process, though one that must be embraced by fintech lenders with an interest in surviving the unforgiving vicissitudes of the credit cycle. Defeating naivety I'm picking on ZestFinance only because it's the most open with its belief that the power to assess creditworthiness has been fundamentally transformed by technology. Indeed, based on conversations I've had with fintech entrepreneurs in the past, this opinion is common among fintech entrepreneurs who are well meaning and have years of experience writing code, but little knowledge of the undomesticated nature of credit. One explanation for this naivety is that many fintech entrepreneurs don't appreciate how common financial crises are. In the nearly 215 years since the turn of the eighteenth century, as I've noted previously, the United States has experienced 14 major bank panics. That equates to one every decade and a half. Another explanation is that fintech entrepreneurs involved in lending have the luxury of being dogmatic, as their personal capital tends to be insulated from their firms' credit decisions. Just like the fat cat bankers of yore, marketplace lenders such as LendingClub and Lending Tree traffic in other peoples' money, merely matching creditors with debtors. The inherent fragility of this model has proven itself repeatedly in the past. It was a loan broker that caused the nation's first "too big to fail" bank, Continental Illinois, to go under in 1984. And it was mortgage brokers like Countrywide Financial that led to so much destruction in the crisis eight years ago, which explains why JPMorgan Chase has forevermore sworn them off. Nassim Taleb makes this point especially elegantly in his book Antifragile. "For the Romans, engineers needed to spend some time under the bridge they built -- something that should be required of financial engineers today," he writes. "The English went further and had the families of the engineers spend time with them under the bridge after it was built." In short, while it's tempting to dismiss the hundreds of years' worth of experience reflected in the history of banking as outdated, fintech lenders do so at their peril. This won't be obvious until the credit cycle takes a turn for the worse, which could be many years from now, but when it happens it's those companies that embrace the lessons of the past that will not only survive the chaos and disorder, but emerge from it in a stronger competitive position.

Now, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is adding another unwelcome element: banking fees. In a handful of jurisdictions, the biggest U.S. bank by assets handles administration of the juror-compensation system, issuing debit cards instead of the age-old system of paper checks. In addition to the juror pay, the cards also come loaded with fees -- for balance inquiries, for inactivity, for using non-Chase ATMs, for charges with insufficient funds and for cash or check issuance. The funds become impossible to withdraw from an ATM once the balance falls below $20, and in at least one jurisdiction -- Washington, D.C. -- there are no Chase branches or ATMs within 90 miles (145 kilometers), ensuring the funds will eventually be frittered away to the bank. William Mark Scott, a lawyer who served on a jury in Washington last year, sued JPMorgan, accusing it of unjust enrichment and violation of the Consumer Protection Act. He’s seeking to represent all other jurors who were paid with JPMorgan debit cards. "Chase uses its monopolistic control over juror funds to steal captive jurors’ money by assessing unconscionable and deceptive fees," Scott claims. "By making it prohibitively expensive to receive an over-the-counter cash withdrawal from, or to receive a check drawn upon the debit card, Chase ensures a ‘rump’ balance will be left on each debit card -- and forfeited." For more see: JPMorgan Pays Inmates for Fees on Get-Out-of-Jail Debit Card Tasha Pelio, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to immediately comment on the lawsuit. It’s the second time in two years that Chase has been accused of taking advantage of captive customers. In 2015, thousands of ex-convicts said Chase charged predatory fees through debit cards issued to people leaving prison. The cards held prison pay and commissary balances. Chase took over distribution of prisoner pay under a contract with the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Chase paid almost $450,000 to settle the lawsuit. For local courts, having a big bank come in and take over the juror-pay system was welcome relief. The cost of overseeing the system and cutting checks is time-consuming and expensive. In some jurisdictions, budget liabilities swelled into the tens of thousands of dollars as some jurors didn’t bother to cash or deposit checks. The full scope of JPMorgan’s juror pay program is unclear. Washington, Livingston County, Michigan, and Gwinnett County, Georgia, have adopted it, according to a Google search. Fort Bend County, Texas, also considered it but it is unclear if it went into effect there. JPMorgan doesn’t appear to disclose any information about the program in its financial statements. The bank announced in 2014 that it would exit the pre-paid card business, but continues to administer the program in jurisdictions where it is still under contract.

Sign Up Scott said in his lawsuit that he served in July on a superior court jury in Washington D.C., which pays $30 a day and $4 daily for travel. He got a Chase debit card and was twice charged 25 cents for not having sufficient funds when making a purchase. He was also twice charged $1.50 for inactivity. With about $13 left on the card, he has few ways of using it and expects it to be eventually eaten by fees. "If there is, in fact, any way for jurors to use or withdraw their rump balances, Chase conceals this in order to milk more fees from them," he claimed in the lawsuit. "Indeed, Chase expects and relies on individuals forfeiting these funds to the bank." The case is Scott v JPMorgan Chase & Co., 17-cv-249, U.S. District Court for District of Columbia (Washington).

Sid Verma Bloomberg News Published Wednesday, Feb. 08, 2017 10:38AM EST Last updated Wednesday, Feb. 08, 2017 10:38AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Rising political risks. A fading era of central-bank stimulus. The potential end of a multi-decade bull run in U.S. government debt. Markets have so far this year shrugged off a laundry list of looming headwinds, with U.S. equities scaling new heights and sales of corporate bonds reaching record levels. What gives? While major economies have shown signs of improvement in recent months, helping to rekindle investors’ animal spirits, a key and typically over-looked technical indicator has helped juice the global rally in financial assets: supply. Net supply of global equities, for example, may flatline this year after falling into negative territory in 2016 for the first time on record, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Meanwhile, bond investors in Europe, the U.S., and emerging markets are poised to become cash-rich in the coming months thanks to an avalanche of maturing debt -- a dynamic which should help them soak up fresh sales. In both the equity and bond markets, the implications are the same. A benign supply outlook is a positive market technical for corporate financing conditions around the world that may lend support to asset valuations and provide a cushion against the slew of event risks looming this year, including elections in Europe and U.S.-fue;led trade wars. A First for Equities Analysts at JPMorgan paint a stark illustration of this positive picture for market technicals. They calculate that global equity supply fell into negative territory last year for the first time ever, as share buybacks, mergers and leveraged buyouts offset public offerings and other corporate activities that tend to increase the amount of shares outstanding, such as rights issues and employee stock programs. “The decline in equity supply last year created a support for equity markets, largely offsetting the decline in demand by retail investors,” Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, who leads the U.S. bank’s flow-and liquidity team, wrote in a report published last week. Even if retail investors continue to demonstrate limited appetite for stocks relative to bonds, a benign supply story may continue to lift equity markets this year, the strategists concluded. “Into 2017, we expect global equity supply to remain close to zero. A projected increase in equity offerings is likely to be offset by stronger equity withdrawal as repatriation bolsters U.S. share buybacks,” they said. Buoyant Bonds The market for new corporate bonds denominated in euros and dollars has been on fire this year -- sales of U.S. investment-grade debt set an all-time monthly record in January after reaching $185 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence -- as companies seek to fund themselves ahead of expected U.S. interest rate hikes. But the glut is less fierce when taking into account ample investor firepower this year, a positive technical that may help to keep credit spreads in check. Net supply of new U.S. investment-grade debt could decline by as much as 31 per cent to $511-billion in 2017 thanks to a wave of maturing bonds and coupon payments, Bank of America Corp. analysts calculated in November. That would signal a sharp reduction in the supply of debt issued by companies with stronger balance sheets compared with the roughly $200-billion in new annual funding needs notched in the previous four years. What’s more, corporate bond issuance in euros has been decidedly modest in recent months in both investment-grade and high-yield markets after taking into account a rise in maturing debt. Net supply of euro-denominated bonds issued by riskier firms has been flat over the past three months, according to Citigroup Inc., helping to drive yields to record lows. Who Needs the ECB? Meanwhile, the outstanding stock of euro-denominated investment-grade debt shrunk by 28 billion euros ($30-billion) between December and January -- all before the European Central Bank purchased a single bond -- thanks to a wave of redemptions, according to Citi. It’s a similar story for bonds sold by companies in developing countries. Emerging market corporate bond redemptions in euros and dollars will increase to $165-billion from $97-billion in 2016, Barclays Plc analysts calculated in November. That suggests primary markets should be able to digest any year-on-year increase in gross corporate debt supply. And then there’s the demand picture. Resilient interest from buyers continues to buoy global debt markets, as the so-called great rotation -- a projected flood of capital migrating out of bond markets and into stocks -- has yet to materialize. The four-week moving average of fund flows into U.S. equity funds has fallen to zero, while capital flowing into U.S. bond funds has surged to a six-month high, according to a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. report this week, citing EPFR Global data. In short, a world with excess savings is still struggling to sate its appetite for investable assets in public markets, amid a net shortage of new stocks and corporate bonds.

Some of the best Visa credit cards offer outstanding rewards and perks. But there are a lot of options available, and it can be difficult to narrow them down. <!-- iframe --> Forutunately, CreditCards.com recently compiled the best credit cards from its partners. Here are the nine best Visa credit cards from that list: 1. Top Visa rewards card: Chase Freedom Unlimited Generous cash rewards and an attractive introductory statement credit make the Chase Freedom Unlimited credit card a standout choice among Visa cards. Highlights:  The Chase Freedom Unlimited card pays 1.5 percent cash back on every purchase. You can earn a $150 bonus statement credit for spending $500 purchases within the first three months of opening an account. Rewards can be redeemed for cash in any amount at any time. Cash rewards don't expire as long as the account is open. Who should get this card:  The Chase Freedom Unlimited card is ideal for the individual who wants a simple rewards card for daily purchases with no annual fee. It has a wide range of redemption options. And Chase Ultimate Rewards® can be transferred to other Chase cards. Since it offers a zero percent 15-month intro APR on purchases and balance transfers, this card can also be a good option for those who would like to make a big purchase and slowly pay it off. After the initial intro period, the card has a variable APR of 15.49 percent to 24.24 percent. But while this card's cash-back rate is good, it isn't the highest flat-rate available — the Citi® Double Cash Card offers one 1 percent cash back on every dollar spent plus an additional 1 percent on every dollar that's paid off. You also won't find bonus categories with this card, a downside if you spend frequently in one area where you want to maximize rewards. RATE SEARCH: Compare the best rewards credit cards. 2. Top Visa balance transfer card: The Chase Slate® The Chase Slate® ranks high in the balance transfer card category for its long introductory period and lenient stance on late payments. Highlights: The Chase Slate® has a 15-month no-interest intro period on balance transfers. There's no balance transfer fee for balances transferred within the first 60 days of account opening. After that, the fee for balance transfers is 5 percent of the amount transferred with a minimum of $5. Who should get this card If you want a basic balance transfer card with a moderate 0 percent APR introductory period, no fee for balance transfers and flexibility on late payments, the Chase Slate® is a good option. This card has no annual fee and no penalty APR for late payments. After the 15-month intro period, the rate for purchases and balance transfers on the Chase Slate® is a variable 15.49 percent to 24.24 percent. The Chase Slate® doesn't have the longest intro period available. At 21 months, the Citi Simplicity® Card has the longest zero percent intro period currently on the market. And with the Chase Slate®, your balance transfer can't exceed $15,000 or your credit limit , whichever is lower. RATE SEARCH: Compare the best balance transfer cards today. 3. Top Visa travel and airline card: Chase Sapphire Reserve The rewards program alone is enough to put the Chase Sapphire Reserve on CreditCards.com's list, but it also has substantial bonus point opportunities and an annual travel credit. Highlights: The Chase Sapphire Reserve offers three Chase Ultimate Rewards® points per dollar spent on travel and dining at restaurants worldwide. It offers one point per dollar spent on other purchases. You can receive up to $300 in statement credits annually as a reimbursement for travel purchases. Who should get this card: The Chase Sapphire Reserve can be a good option if you spend big on travel and dining. But it's a significantly good choice if you enjoy redemption options through the Chase Ultimate Rewards® program. That's because points can be redeemed for 1.5 cents per point through Chase Ultimate Rewards®. As a cardholder, you'll also get access to more than 900 airport lounges worldwide with complimentary Priority Pass Select membership. The downside is that this card's hefty $450 annual fee can easily eat into rewards if you're not spending heavily on travel and dining related expenses. And it comes with a variable APR between 16.49 percent and 23.49 percent — not ideal if you typically carry a balance. RATE SEARCH: Compare the best airline and travel credit cards. 4. Top Visa points rewards card: Chase Sapphire Preferred® card Outstanding points rewards, a significant sign-up bonus and a low annual fee make the Chase Sapphire Preferred® a solid choice among Visa points rewards cards. Highlights: With this card, you can earn two points per dollar on travel and restaurants worldwide. It offers one point per dollar on all other purchases. Cardholders can earn 50,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 within the first three months of opening the account. When redeemed through the Chase Ultimate Rewards® program, that's $625 toward travel. This card offers $5,000 bonus points for adding an authorized user within the first three months of opening an account. Who should get this card: If you want a low-fee points rewards card with great perks, the Chase Sapphire Preferred® card is a solid pick. When points are redeemed through the Chase Ultimate Rewards® program, they are worth 25 percent more. This card has no introductory fee for the first year. After that, the fee is $95 per year. It has a variable APR from 16.49 percent to 23.49 percent. 5. Top Visa no annual fee card: Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa® Outstanding cash rewards, bonus opportunities and nice perks — all without an annual fee — put the Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa® card on the list as the top no annual fee card. Highlights: The Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa® offers 1.5 percent cash rewards on every purchase made with the card. For purchases made with Android Pay™ or Apple Pay™ during the first 12 months of account opening, this card offers 1.8 percent cash rewards. Cardholders can earn a $150 cash rewards bonus after spending $1,000 in net purchases during the first three months after account opening. Who should get this card: If you're in the market for a straightforward card with solid cash rewards and no annual fee, the Wells Fargo Cash Wise Visa® is a good choice. The cash rewards don't expire as long as you keep your account open, there are no category restrictions and no quarterly sign ups. It's an especially good option if you're already a Wells Fargo customer, since you can manage all of your accounts from one place. But while the simplicity and cash-back rate of this card is attractive, it doesn't offer the highest flat-rate cash-back rewards around. The Citi® Double Cash Card offers 1 percent back on every purchase and an additional 1 percent when you pay your balance. It comes with a zero percent introductory APR on balance transfers and purchases for the first 12 months. And it's regular APR is a variable 13.49 percent to 25.49 percent. 6. Top Visa no foreign transaction fee card: BankAmericard Travel Rewards® The BankAmericard Travel Rewards® credit card's generous points rewards, easy redemption options and online bonus opportunity put it in the top of its class among Visa cards. Highlights: Cardholders earn unlimited 1.5 points per $1 spent on all purchases This card offers the opportunity to earn 20,000 online bonus points for making at least $1,000 in purchases during the first 90 days of account opening. Points can be redeemed to pay for flights, hotels, rental cars, vacation packages and other travel-related purchases. You're not limited to specific websites or blackout dates. Who should get this card: The BankAmericard Travel Rewards® credit card is a standout option for those who want an easy-to-use, well-balanced travel card, particularly for overseas use. This card will be particularly appealing to existing Bank of America® customers with a checking or savings account, who can earn an extra 10 percent bonus. Those who qualify for the Preferred Rewards program can increase their bonus to 25 percent to 75 percent. In addition to the rewards perks, cardholders who carry a balance, or who have a large purchase to make, will enjoy the zero percent introductory APR on purchases for 12 billing cycles. Its regular APR is a variable 15.49 percent to 23.49 percent on purchases and balance transfers. There's no annual fee. RATE SEARCH: Compare the best travel credit cards now. 7. Top Visa gas card: BankAmericard Cash Rewards® Generous cash back on gas purchases put this card on CreditCards.com's radar. But it's also a great all-around card for cash back. Highlights: The BankAmericard Cash Rewards® card offers 3 percent cash back on gas purchases, 2 percent on grocery stores and wholesale clubs and 1 percent on all other purchases up to $2,500 in combined grocery store, wholesale club and gas purchases each quarter. Cardholders have the chance to earn a $100 online cash rewards bonus after spending at least $500 within the first 90 days of account opening. Who should get this card: If you spend big on gas, groceries and wholesale clubs, this card might be a good fit for you. Plus, every time you redeem your cash back into a Bank of America® checking or savings account, you can get a 10 percent customer bonus. That bonus increases 25 percent to 75 percent if you're a Preferred Rewards client. While this serves as a great gas card, there are cash back cards available that pay a higher rate. The Blue Cash Preferred® card from American Express offers 6 percent cash back at U.S. supermarkets, 3 percent at gas stations and 1 percent on all other purchases. The BankAmericard Cash Rewards® card has a 0 percent intro APR period for 12 billing cycles on purchases. It offers the same for balance transfers made within the first 60 days. There's no annual fee. The APR is 13.49 percent to 23.49 percent. 8. Top Visa business card: Chase Ink Business Preferred Credit Card The Chase Ink Business Preferred credit card earns high marks for its standout bonus opportunities and points on business-related spending. Highlights: The Chase Ink Preferred card offers three points per $1 on the first $150,000 spent on select categories each account anniversary year. You can earn one point per $1 spent on all other purchases with no limit. You can earn 80,000 bonus points after spending $5,000 on purchases within the first three months of opening an account. Points are worth 25 percent more when redeemed through the Chase Ultimate Rewards® program. Who should get this card:   If you spend heavily on business-related expenses, the Chase Ink Preferred credit card is a solid option. It's particularly attractive if you plan on spending at least $5,000 within the first three months to earn the bonus, which is equal to a $1,000 toward travel when redeemed through the Chase Ultimate Rewards® program. Keep in mind that this card comes with an annual fee of $95. You'll need to make sure you spend enough to cancel out the fee. The APR is 13.49 percent to 23.49 percent. RATE SEARCH: Compare the best business credit cards. 9. Top Visa unsecured credit card: Credit One Bank® Unsecured Platinum Visa® The Credit One Bank® Unsecured Platinum Visa® card's cash back rewards and flexible payment policy make it an attractive option among unsecured credit cards. Highlights: When using this card, regular reports are sent to the three major credit bureaus, helping to build your credit responsibly. The Credit One Bank® Unsecured Visa® Credit Card provides free online access to your credit score and credit report summary, which can help you track your progress as you work to improve your overall credit. Cardholders earn 1 percent cash back for gas or groceries purchases. Who should get this card: If you're looking to build credit while earning cash-back rewards for gas and grocery purchases, the Credit One Bank® Unsecured Visa® is a good choice. But keep in mind that it's best used when you don't often miss payments or carry a balance. The high fees on this card could quickly cancel out any rewards earned. Its annual fee ranges between $0 and $75 for the first year and between $0 and $99 for each following year. It has a variable APR that ranges from 15.65 percent to 24.15 percent.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Rising political risks. A fading era of central-bank stimulus. The potential end of a multi-decade bull run in U.S. government debt. Markets have so far this year shrugged off a laundry list of looming headwinds, with U.S. equities scaling new heights and sales of corporate bonds reaching record levels. What gives? While major economies have shown signs of improvement in recent months, helping to rekindle investors’ animal spirits, a key and typically over-looked technical indicator has helped juice the global rally in financial assets: supply. Net supply of global equities, for example, may flatline this year after falling into negative territory in 2016 for the first time on record, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Meanwhile, bond investors in Europe, the U.S., and emerging markets are poised to become cash-rich in the coming months thanks to an avalanche of maturing debt -- a dynamic which should help them soak up fresh sales. In both the equity and bond markets, the implications are the same. A benign supply outlook is a positive market technical for corporate financing conditions around the world that may lend support to asset valuations and provide a cushion against the slew of event risks looming this year, including elections in Europe and U.S.-fueled trade wars. A First for Equities Analysts at JPMorgan paint a stark illustration of this positive picture for market technicals. They calculate that global equity supply fell into negative territory last year for the first time ever, as share buybacks, mergers and leveraged buyouts offset public offerings and other corporate activities that tend to increase the amount of shares outstanding, such as rights issues and employee stock programs. “The decline in equity supply last year created a support for equity markets, largely offsetting the decline in demand by retail investors,” Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, who leads the U.S. bank’s flow-and liquidity team, wrote in a report published last week. Even if retail investors continue to demonstrate limited appetite for stocks relative to bonds, a benign supply story may continue to lift equity markets this year, the strategists concluded. “Into 2017, we expect global equity supply to remain close to zero. A projected increase in equity offerings is likely to be offset by stronger equity withdrawal as repatriation bolsters U.S. share buybacks,” they said. Buoyant Bonds The market for new corporate bonds denominated in euros and dollars has been on fire this year -- sales of U.S. investment-grade debt set an all-time monthly record in January after reaching $185 billion, according to Bloomberg Intelligence -- as companies seek to fund themselves ahead of expected U.S. interest rate hikes. But the glut is less fierce when taking into account ample investor firepower this year, a positive technical that may help to keep credit spreads in check. Net supply of new U.S. investment-grade debt could decline by as much as 31 percent to $511 billion in 2017 thanks to a wave of maturing bonds and coupon payments, Bank of America Corp. analysts calculated in November. That would signal a sharp reduction in the supply of debt issued by companies with stronger balance sheets compared with the roughly $200 billion in new annual funding needs notched in the previous four years. What’s more, corporate bond issuance in euros has been decidedly modest in recent months in both investment-grade and high-yield markets after taking into account a rise in maturing debt. Net supply of euro-denominated bonds issued by riskier firms has been flat over the past three months, according to Citigroup Inc., helping to drive yields to record lows. Who Needs the ECB? Meanwhile, the outstanding stock of euro-denominated investment-grade debt shrunk by 28 billion euros ($30 billion) between December and January -- all before the European Central Bank purchased a single bond -- thanks to a wave of redemptions, according to Citi. It’s a similar story for bonds sold by companies in developing countries. Emerging market corporate bond redemptions in euros and dollars will increase to $165 billion from $97 billion in 2016, Barclays Plc analysts calculated in November. That suggests primary markets should be able to digest any year-on-year increase in gross corporate debt supply. And then there’s the demand picture. Resilient interest from buyers continues to buoy global debt markets, as the so-called great rotation -- a projected flood of capital migrating out of bond markets and into stocks -- has yet to materialize. The four-week moving average of fund flows into U.S. equity funds has fallen to zero, while capital flowing into U.S. bond funds has surged to a six-month high, according to a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. report this week, citing EPFR Global data. In short, a world with excess savings is still struggling to sate its appetite for investable assets in public markets, amid a net shortage of new stocks and corporate bonds. © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

Don’t dismiss anomalous numbers just because they don’t support your preferred theory. by Peter Coy @petercoy More stories by Peter Coy February 9, 2017, 2:15 PM EST From Subscribe Reprints Photographer: Spencer Platt/Getty Images Wall Street economists insisted for months that the labor market couldn’t possibly get tighter without triggering wage inflation. “We are at full employment,” Deutsche Bank Securities headlined a note to clients in October. “Leading indicators of inflation flashing red,” it wrote days later. “On the cusp of full recovery,” Goldman Sachs wrote in December. “Wage inflation continues to gain traction,” JPMorgan Chase economists said in January. Then came February, and Wall Street’s much-anticipated wage pressure was nowhere to be seen. Even though employers added a more-than-expected 227,000 workers in January, average hourly earnings rose just 0.1 percent. Forecasters struggled to make sense of why Americans’ pay had barely risen at all. “What happened with wages?” asked economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The pay-growth puzzle bears on the vitality of the U.S. and this presidency It’s hard to blame the economists for overestimating wage growth; they’re applying the time-honored law of supply and demand. It stands to reason that when workers are in greater demand, they’ll be able to hold out for better pay. The mystery is why that hasn’t been happening in the U.S., at least not as much as most experts expected. The pay-growth puzzle bears on the vitality of the U.S. economy in coming years, to say nothing of the vitality of the Donald Trump presidency. If wage inflation really does threaten to overheat, the Federal Reserve under Chair Janet Yellen will feel obliged to raise interest rates to slow down the economy. That will prevent Trump from making good on his campaign promises to raise the growth rate to 3.5 percent, 4 percent, 5 percent, or more. If there’s no wage inflation brewing, on the other hand, the Fed can afford to hold back, economic growth can accelerate, and the Republicans should do well in the 2018 midterm elections and beyond. No matter what you think of Trump, you should be hoping that the U.S. economy isn’t, in fact, already bumping up against its speed limit. Because if it is, it means that speed limit is distressingly low—and American living standards can improve only at a snail’s pace. Output dropped sharply during the last recession. Instead of springing back like a yo-yo, it’s drifted upward at a meager 2 percent a year. If the economy had grown since the end of 2007 at the average pace it did from 1947 to 2007, it would be 22 percent bigger than it is today. That’s a difference in annual gross domestic product of more than $4 trillion. The minuscule 0.1 percent increase in hourly earnings in January is, in this context, a strange mixture of good news and bad news. It’s bad news because it means long-suffering workers still aren’t getting the substantial raises they need to pay their bills. Labor has been getting a smaller share of the national income, while the share going to capital owners (business owners and shareholders) has been rising. And consumers can’t buy more stuff if they aren’t being paid more. The good news is that the small increase shows the economy can easily employ more people, and generate more goods and services, without overheating. It’s possible, of course, that the earnings growth number was a fluke. Economists found numerous reasons to play it down after its release by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Feb. 3. For one thing, a lot of the January employment growth was in lower-paying jobs such as retail, leisure, and hospitality, which put a drag on average hourly earnings. For another, wages in the high-paying financial sector fell 1 percent—a rare and unexplained drop that might well be reversed in February. Those who believe wage inflation is threatening point out that the labor market has indeed tightened over the past year by many measures. Earnings are up 2.5 percent over the past 12 months, and surveys of companies and consumers show the highest expectations for wage gains since the last recession. About half of small businesses report there are few or no qualified applicants for job openings, up from a quarter that said so in 2009. And people are voluntarily quitting jobs at a prerecession pace—something that could force employers to jack up pay to hang on to valued workers. “There are no good reasons why wage inflation should slow down now, because the economy is at full employment,” wrote Torsten Slok, Deutsche Bank Securities’ chief international economist, in an e-mail. It’s dangerous, though, to dismiss anomalous numbers just because they don’t appear to fit with economic theory. It might be that the tiny earnings gain in January wasn’t a fluke after all, but rather an indicator that workers still lack bargaining power. David Weil, a Boston University Questrom School of Business economist who worked in the U.S. Labor Department under President Obama, says wages are suppressed because corporations have “fissured”—shunted their low-wage employees to outsourcers who pay them even less. One sign of slack is that companies haven’t been adding overtime hours, which they tend to do when they can’t hire as many workers as they need. Another strong indication of slack is that the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.8 percent in January, from 4.7 percent in December, as people flooded into the labor market searching for work. The rate of participation in the labor force, which fell sharply from 2008 through 2013, has stopped falling despite the retirement of many baby boomers. “It’s far from obvious to me that we’re on the cusp of an imminent breakout of wage growth,” says Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist for Deutsche Bank Securities, parting from his colleague Slok. In other words, Trump may be onto something in averring that the economy still has room for growth. He’s not one to comb through the BLS website to deepen his understanding of the economy. During the campaign he called the official unemployment rate that the BLS publishes “one of the biggest hoaxes in American modern politics.” That said, the president is “absolutely right in saying that the labor market has much more slack in it than the Fed and other commentators are thinking about,” said David Blanchflower, a Dartmouth economics professor and former Bank of England policymaker, on Bloomberg TV before the latest unemployment report. Yellen could yet prove to be one of Trump’s most important allies in the fight for growth—even though he alleged during the campaign that the Fed was more political than Hillary Clinton. Blanchflower’s comment about “the Fed and other commentators” isn’t fair to Yellen, who’s pushed back against economists who warn that the central bank will invite inflation if it doesn’t aggressively raise interest rates to slow growth. “A natural question is whether monetary policy has fallen behind the curve,” she said in a speech at Stanford in January. “The short answer, I believe, is no.” The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Economics makes strange bedfellows. Liberals who backed Obama’s demands for fiscal stimulus are now worrying that Trump will somehow engineer a growth spurt that will carry Republicans past Democrats in the next one or two election cycles. “Nobody I know in Congress doesn’t want job creation, but who gets the credit? That’s hard on them,” says Leo Hindery, a Democrat who’s managing partner of private equity firm InterMedia Partners in New York. Democrats are left warning that stimulus, especially if it’s in the form of tax cuts for the rich, will be a “sugar rush” that will leave ordinary Americans worse off. When it comes to economic data, it can be difficult to separate what people believe to be true from what they want to be true. “People need to be a little more scientific and a little less political in the nature of their interpretation,” says Robert Johnson, president of the left-leaning Institute for New Economic Thinking. “It’s times like this when people are least scientific.”   —With Patricia Laya Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Wall Street strategists and company analysts have already been hard at work giving clients ways to play this big moment for the markets. Just a few weeks ago Goldman Sachs strategist David Kostin shared a basket of stocks with the highest effective tax rates that he believes will benefit the most from the lowering of the corporate tax rate. Here are seven stocks the firm recommended in its "high tax rate" basket. In similar fashion, JPMorgan agreed with the same thesis of buying companies with high tax rates. "Companies with high effective tax rates and high domestic revenue exposure will disproportionately benefit from a reduction in tax rates," U.S. equity strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote in a note to clients. Here are 10 names the JPMorgan strategist highlighted with the highest tax rates. Strategas Research Partners focused on a different area of tax policy. The firm told clients to buy stocks that will benefit from his likely plan to allow multinationals to bring foreign profits back into the country at a reduced tax rate. "We have been surprised that our repatriation basket has not outperformed post-election since this tax change has the highest probability of being enacted," Dan Clifton wrote. For investors who want to trade the repatriation tax holiday being implemented, here are five companies in the firm's repatriation basket. In regards to company-specific ideas, Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Jayant is bullish on Disney shares due to tax reform. "Disney has a pro-inflation business model (advertising, theme park & resort pricing), is largely domestic, is a full taxpayer, has low leverage, and has relatively high capital expenditure levels," Jayant wrote in a note to clients. "Broadly speaking, in considering the primary insinuations put forth by Congressman Ryan's tax reform blueprint ... Disney stands to be a significant beneficiary." And Citi Research's Michael Rollins upgraded Verizon due to Trump's agenda earlier this year. "Since the election, we have become more optimistic on the prospects for tax reform and have been able to better understand the potential benefits for Verizon. We also believe Verizon is likely to see a lighter touch from regulation," analyst Rollins wrote. Finally, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods told investors to buy American Express as tax cuts will lead to more credit card spending. "Our analysis shows that historical changes in tax rates (both personal and corporate) have been catalysts for billed business growth (and GDP growth)," analyst Sanjay Sakhrani wrote. show chapters Trump: Will make tax announcement in a few weeks    Thursday, 9 Feb 2017 | 2:02 PM ET | 01:41 Tae KimInvesting Journalist Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change DIS --- To view this site, you need to have JavaScript enabled in your browser, and either the Flash Plugin or an HTML5-Video enabled browser.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 February 2017 by Military News Nearly Forty Percent of Families Face an Extraordinary Medical, Auto or Tax Payment Annually, New JPMorgan Chase Institute Data Show WASHINGTON–(BUSINESS WIRE)–New JPMorgan Chase Institute data on the financial health of U.S. households show that in any given year almost four in ten families make an extraordinary payment related to medical services, auto repair, or taxes of roughly $1,500, and it’s taking them over a year to recover from major medical expenses. Middle-income households also experienced a nearly $1,300 swing in monthly expenses, which is the equivalent of one month’s rent or mortgage payment. Coping with Costs: Big Data on Expense Volatility and Medical Payments builds on anonymized account data of roughly 250,000 core Chase checking account customers from January 2013 to December 2015. It is the third in a series of Institute reports evaluating household finances, including its inaugural report, Weathering Volatility: Big Data on the Financial Ups and Downs of US Individuals and its report on income volatility, Paychecks, Paydays and the Online Platform Economy: Big Data on Income Volatility. This new report found that extraordinary medical payments were most common during tax season and coincided with a 4 percent increase in total income. Families acquired over $900 more in liquid assets before making a major medical payment, yet many families did not recover financially within a year after making a major medical payment. Twelve months after the payment, savings remained depleted for almost half of families (48%) and credit card debt remained elevated for almost a third of families (33%). “This could be the most granular look at families’ financial volatility we have ever seen,” said Diana Farrell, President and CEO, JPMorgan Chase Institute. “Even with more money in their pocket from tax refunds, the strain of major and unexpected medical costs are hitting families hard and making it difficult for them to recover.” Following are the key findings for this most recent look at the state of expense volatility for US households. Key Findings: Coping with Costs: Big Data on Expense Volatility and Medical Payments Finding One: Expenses fluctuate by nearly $1,300 or 29% on a month-to-month basis for median-income households, or $7,391 year-to-year. Discretionary expenses are more volatile than non-discretionary expenses in percentage terms. Month-to-month discretionary expenses fluctuate by 56 percent or $514 while non-discretionary expenses fluctuate by 28 percent or $735. Finding Two: Expense volatility was high across the income and age spectrum. While older families typically had less volatile incomes, they exhibited a larger range of income and expense volatility. Older families maintain similar, if not higher, levels of expense volatility even after significant decreases in income volatility after age 60. Finding Three: Almost four in ten families per year—particularly middle-income and older families—made an extraordinary payment over $1,500 related to medical services, auto repair, or taxes. One in ten families made more than one extraordinary payment in a given year. One in six families (16%) made at least one major medical payment in a given year, including 3% who made two or more. Older Americans had the highest incidence of extraordinary payments across all three types. Forty-four percent of families 65 and older made at least one extraordinary payment compared to that of 22 percent of adults under 25. Finding Four: Extraordinary medical payments were more likely to occur in months with higher income and specifically during tax season. Extraordinary medical payments were most common in March and April and coincided with a 4 percent increase in total income increases. The income increase stemmed mostly from tax refunds and not labor income. Finding Five: Prior to a major medical payment, families garnered significant liquid assets but did not recover financially within 12 months after the payment. Families acquired over $900 more in liquid assets before a major medical payment; this represented a 5 percent increase. The increase in liquid assets is more pronounced for families in the bottom percentile of liquid assets indicating they face a stronger liquidity constraint. Fifty-three percent of families increased their liquid assets one month prior to the medical payment, many of whom immediately spent them down in the month with a medical payment. Many families did not recover financially within a year after a major medical payment. In aggregate, comparing 12 months after the medical payment to the baseline period, income was 3 percent lower, non-medical expenses was 1 percent lower, liquid assets were 2 percent lower, and revolving balance was 9 percent higher. “Our integrated, high-frequency data on income, expenses, assets, and liabilities shed new light on the connection between physical health and financial health and the reality that families are not fully insured against the economic consequences of major health events,” added Farrell. “This indicates a need for better products and solutions to help families manage expense volatility and become more financially resilient.” View the full report Coping with Costs: Big Data on Expense Volatility and Medical Payments.

These three stocks may soon oblige. (Photo: Getty Images) 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Dividend stocks can be the foundation of a great retirement portfolio. Not only do the payments put money in your pocket, which can help hedge against any dips in the stock market, but they're usually a sign of a financially sound company. Dividends also give investors a painless opportunity to reinvest in a stock, thus compounding gains over time. However, not all income stocks live up to their full potential. Using the payout ratio -- i.e., the percentage of profits a company returns to its shareholders as dividends -- we can get a good read on whether or not a company has room to increase its dividend. Payout ratios between 50% and 75% are ideal. Here are three income stocks with payout ratios currently below 50% that could potentially double their dividend payments. Gilead Sciences We'll begin the week by taking a closer look at a biotech behemoth that's potentially guilty of being too good: Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD). Gilead Sciences' claim to fame is its hepatitis C product portfolio (Harvoni, Sovaldi, and Epclusa). Gilead was the first company to bring an effective once-daily cure to pharmacy shelves, and it's not really relinquished its market share since. Its issues of late stem from its need to provide larger gross-to-net discounts to insurers for Harvoni, the HCV drug designed to treat the most common type of hepatitis C, genotype 1, and its having already nabbed the low-hanging fruit in the HCV market within the U.S. However, don't think for a moment that declining EPS and revenue estimates are a reason to avoid Gilead. For starters, Gilead's HCV products still have a massive market opportunity to hit. Even with the low-hanging fruit in the U.S. out of the way, Gilead has ample opportunity to treat the estimated 180 million people worldwide infected with hepatitis C. Even though some of these people aren't in countries where Gilead would receive the best margins, it nonetheless represents a long runway of opportunity. Not to mention the fact that none of Gilead's peers have even come close to improving the treatment timeframe and supplanting Gilead's therapies. Gilead Sciences is also a mammoth in the HIV treatment space. The company has around a half-dozen oral HIV innovations under its belt, with Stribild and Genvoya being among the most impressive and fastest growing treatments. Combined, Gilead's HCV and HIV franchises, along with its smaller approved therapies, should allow it to generate $15 billion or more in annual free cash flow through the end of the decade. This gives Gilead more than enough capital to seek out acquisitions and boost its shareholder yield. Remember, the last time Gilead made a big acquisition it acquired Pharmasset's leading asset, which spawned its HCV line of drugs. Currently paying out $1.88 annually (a 2.6% dividend yield), but slated to earn in excess of $10.50 per share each year through 2019, Gilead is a strong candidate to double its payout to shareholders. Union Pacific Another attractive rebound candidate is railroad giant Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP), which just finished up a challenging 2016. With commodity prices still challenged, Union Pacific found the sledding tough in most of its major freight categories. Coal freight revenue fell 6% in the fourth quarter, while chemicals were flat. The lone bright spot was agricultural products, where freight revenue rose 7%.  (Photo: Union Pacific) The good news is that a number of macroeconomic factors are looking up in 2017. For instance, consumer confidence is improving, which is great news for a cyclical logistics company like Union Pacific. Even more intriguing, energy prices are on the mend. Though higher energy prices boost its diesel fuel costs, they also have a positive impact on other commodity costs, as well as on Union Pacific's pricing power per carload. Despite its 2016 weakness, Union Pacific also managed to improve its operating ratio by 120 basis points to 62%. The key reason Union Pacific was able to improve its margin in the face of a weak commodity market was its stringent cost-cutting. As noted by my Foolish colleague Joe Tenebruso, Union Pacific reduced its locomotive count by 5%, while trimming its train, engine, and yard workforce by 7%. Having levers to pull is a nice thing for a cyclical logistics company when commodity prices can seemingly change at the flip of a switch. Considering that locomotives are a more fuel-efficient mode of transport than trucks as a function of total freight transported, it's unlikely that we're going to see freight transport by rail decline for any extended period of time. With Union Pacific currently paying out $2.42 annually (a 2.3% dividend yield), but on track for more than $8 in full-year EPS by 2020, a doubling of its dividend could be possible over the next five-to-10 years. JPMorgan Chase Sticking with the theme of gigantic companies, the last attractive income stock this week is money center bank JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM). JPMorgan Chase has been hindered by a confluence of factors in recent years. For example, dovish monetary policy from the Federal Reserve has constrained its net interest margins, all while tougher regulations imposed from the Fed increased its expenses and reduced existing paths to profitability. As icing on the cake, the banking sector has been a pin cushion for fines since the Great Recession, most of which stem from its mortgage practices.  (Photo: Getty Images) On the plus side, these issues appear to be in the rearview mirror now. Though the Fed has only raised its benchmark federal funds rate twice over the past decade, it's firmly switched from a dovish to hawkish monetary policy. This lends hope that interest rates are going to head higher in the months and years to come. Higher interest rates help boost the net interest income banks generate from their variable loans. According to JPMorgan Chase's latest analysis, a 100-basis-point increase in short- and long-term lending rates would add $2.8 billion in additional net interest income, while a 200-basis-point increase in both would lead to $4.5 billion in additional interest income. For what it's worth, 200 basis points would be very close to the Fed's targeted rate of 3%. Also, JPMorgan Chase stands to benefit from the possibility of relaxed regulations in the banking industry under the Trump administration. If Trump holds to his word and removes a number of banking regulations, it would become substantially easier for JPMorgan Chase and its peers to return money to shareholders. Currently, JPMorgan Chase is paying out $1.92 annually (a 2.3% dividend yield), but Wall Street is looking for $7.47 in full-year EPS by 2018. This would appear to be a recipe for a higher payout ratio and a bigger dividend in JPMorgan's future. Sean Williams has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now For some people, jury duty is a dreaded American civic obligation. Now, JPMorgan Chase is adding another unwelcome element: banking fees. In a handful of jurisdictions, the biggest U.S. bank by assets has taken over administration of the juror-compensation system, issuing debit cards instead of the age-old system of paper checks. In addition to the juror pay, the cards also come loaded with fees -- for balance inquiries, for inactivity, for using non-Chase ATMs, for charges with insufficient funds and for cash or check issuance. The funds become impossible to withdraw from an ATM once the balance falls below $20, and in at least one jurisdiction -- Washington, D.C. -- there are no Chase branches or ATMs within 90 miles (145 kilometers), ensuring the funds will eventually be frittered away to the bank. William Mark Scott, a lawyer who served on a jury in Washington last year, sued JPMorgan, accusing it of unjust enrichment and violation of the Consumer Protection Act. He's seeking to represent all other jurors who were paid with JPMorgan debit cards. "Chase uses its monopolistic control over juror funds to steal captive jurors' money by assessing unconscionable and deceptive fees," Scott claims. "By making it prohibitively expensive to receive an over-the-counter cash withdrawal from, or to receive a check drawn upon the debit card, Chase ensures a 'rump' balance will be left on each debit card -- and forfeited." Tasha Pelio, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to immediately comment on the lawsuit. It's the second time in two years that Chase has been accused of taking advantage of captive customers. In 2015, thousands of ex-convicts said Chase charged predatory fees through debit cards issued to people leaving prison. The cards held prison pay and commissary balances. Chase took over distribution of prisoner pay under a contract with the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Chase paid almost $450,000 to settle the lawsuit. For local courts, having a big bank come in and take over the juror-pay system was welcome relief. The cost of overseeing the system and cutting checks is time-consuming and expensive. In some jurisdictions, budget liabilities swelled into the tens of thousands of dollars as some jurors didn't bother to cash or deposit checks. The full scope of JPMorgan's juror pay program is unclear. Washington and Gwinnett County, Georgia, have both adopted it, according to a Google search. Fort Bend County, Texas, also considered it but it is unclear if it went into effect there. JPMorgan doesn't appear to disclose any information about the program in its financial statements. Scott said in his lawsuit that he served on a Washington D.C. superior court jury in July, and received $30 a day and $4 daily for travel. He got a Chase debit card and was twice charged 25 cents for not having sufficient funds when making a purchase. He was also twice charged $1.50 for inactivity. With about $13 left on the card, he has few ways of using it and expects it to be eventually eaten by fees. "If there is, in fact, any way for jurors to use or withdraw their rump balances, Chase conceals this in order to milk more fees from them," he claimed in the lawsuit. "Indeed, Chase expects and relies on individuals forfeiting these funds to the bank." -By Christian Berthelsen, Bloomberg View Comments Tags Banking Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Feb 8, 2017 at 8:48AM Image source: Getty Images (via iStock/Thinkstock). Despite the current presidential administration's promise to "dismantle" the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, it's become clear that it neither intends to do so nor does it think that it could. This is why Donald Trump's principal economic advisor, Gary Cohn, is focused on changing out the personnel atop the regulatory entities, as the new appointees could then work within the current regulatory structure to ease the burden on banks. But just because the Dodd-Frank Act will probably survive -- assuming the Republicans don't widen their majority in the Senate in the mid-term elections, that is -- doesn't mean Cohn's strategy won't have positive implications for investors in bank stocks. Far and away the biggest benefit is likely to be an increase in dividends and stock buybacks. $100 billion windfall Most companies are free to increase their dividends or buy back more stock at the discretion of their boards of directors. The same isn't true for banks, which are much more tightly constrained when it comes to allocating capital. As a part of the annual stress tests, the nation's largest banks, such as JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C) must request permission to return more capital to shareholders. This has tripped a number of these banks up in the past. A review of Bank of America's stress-test history shows that it was either denied the opportunity to increase its dividend or didn't seek approval to do so in four out of the past six years. Citigroup has run into similar issues as well. And while JPMorgan Chase has been allowed to boost its dividend every year since the crisis, it seems reasonable to conclude that the New York-based bank would return even more capital to shareholders if the decision was entirely up to it. All of the nation's biggest banks have thereby accumulated an enormous amount of capital on their balance sheets. They've collected so much, in fact, that a recent Wall Street Journal article concluded that the nation's six biggest banks could return an incredible "$100 billion in capital to investors over time through dividends and share buybacks if the Trump administration succeeds in a push to loosen bank regulation." The biggest beneficiaries The biggest beneficiaries are likely to be stockholders in Citigroup. According to veteran bank analyst Dick Bove, Citigroup has $30.3 billion worth of excess capital on its balance sheet above and beyond its regulatory minimum. JPMorgan Chase comes in second, with $26.6 billion, followed by Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America, respectively. Bank Excess Capital Citigroup $30.3 billion JPMorgan Chase $26.6 billion Wells Fargo $23.1 billion Goldman Sachs $22.8 billion Morgan Stanley $22.3 billion Bank of America $21.2 billion Data source: Dick Bove, Rafferty Capital Markets. Before getting too excited, however, there are a couple of things to note. The first is that it remains to be seen whether the Federal Reserve would relinquish its veto authority over bank capital plans even if the White House changes out its personnel. After all, regulators are like other humans in that they don't tend to give up power once it's acquired. The second thing to note is that the predicted windfall may not come at one time and is most likely to be channeled through stock buybacks as opposed to dramatically higher dividends. Bank of America and Citigroup may be exceptions, as they currently pay out the smallest share of their earnings to shareholders. But even these two banks are likely to focus more on stock buybacks, given that their shares trade for discounts to their respective book values. Either way, while investors in bank stocks have probably gotten overly optimistic about the extent of an impending regulatory overhaul, this is certainly one area were meaningful changes may be both possible and probable.

Al-Falih is chairman of Saudi Aramco: Ronald Zak/APMore So, little old Moelis, the boutique investment bank, has pipped Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan for the gig to advise on the biggest flotation ever — Saudi Aramco. What a kick in the teeth for Wall Street and City giants, right? Perhaps not. While it’s clearly a major coup for Ken Moelis, the dealmaker who started off at junk bonder Drexel Lambert back in the day, his victory is primarily over boutiques like Rothschild, Lazard and Evercore, not the Wall Street and City global banks. The megabanks will still be coining it from this $2 trillion share sale, distributing the stock to investors around the world. Moelis’s role will be as the Saudis’ trusted consiglieri. It’s been chosen precisely because it is not conflicted like the bulge bracket banks by having securities trading arms elsewhere. As such, you can bet Lazard and Rothschild will be smarting if they don’t end up getting any of the action. They have for centuries been the advisers of choice to governments and sovereigns. Ken Moelis, though, has crept into the Middle East in style. He and his London team have worked on restructuring some of Dubai’s biggest businesses since its financial crisis of 2009. They now sit at the very head of the top table in Saudi. And what a banquet western bankers and investors are set to enjoy there. Deputy crown prince Muhammad Bin Salman’s so-called Vision 2030 programme will see trillions of dollars spent on rebuilding the nation and its economy away from oil. That means multi-billion dollar contracts going up for grabs across the country. British firms are already waking up to the prospect of dollars from the desert; Saudi was our third fastest growing export market in 2011-2015, with top five sectors being nuclear energy, aircraft, weapons, industrial vehicles and luxury cars in that order. But there’s far more to shoot for beyond the obvious likes of Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems, JCB and Bentley. The country is still only our 14th biggest export market — below Hong Kong and even South Korea. Other big UK specialisms like fashion, food and pharmaceuticals still look under-represented, not to mention financial services. With Brexit forcing British firms to seek trade beyond Europe, it’s time for more chief executives to follow Moelis and hop on a plane to Saudi. Time for margin call? An alarming stat in Hargreaves Lansdown’s numbers today. Profit margins last year at the investment fund market jumped from 67% to 71%. Tesco, at its optimistic best, is hoping it will reach 4% by 2020. In any other industry but finance, Hargreaves’ figures might raise an eyebrow from a consumer-championing regulator.

Activists from grassroots anti-"swamp" movements Government Sachs and Resist Here railed against Goldman and JPMorgan Chase for their role in the White House's mission to loosen federal regulations on banks. Members of New York Communities for Change, the Working Families Party and the Hedge Clippers also protested. The demonstration was organized as a part of #ResistTrumpTuesdays, a weekly event organized by Resist Here that began in December. Among those protesting was 31-year-old Harry Waisbren, co-founder of online video network Act.TV and an Occupy Wall Street veteran. "Trump has just taken the [Goldman Sachs] executives, brought them into the White House, and it's absolutely disgusting, especially considering how he won the Republican primary as well as the general election chastising the other candidates for their fealty to Wall Street," Waisbren told CNBC. "The idea of Occupy Wall Street, that we need a government that works for all of us, not just the 1 percent, lives on. It was totally visible and strengthened throughout Bernie Sanders' candidacy," he added. Marchers condemned the banks' influence on the current administration after then-candidate Trump's calls on the campaign trail to "drain the swamp," or clean the federal government of corrupt influence. Trump used the phrase time and again to signal a change from business as usual in Washington. But protesters said that very "swamp" has taken over Trump's White House. Liz Gurdus | CNBC Protesters in New York City rally against President Donald Trump's ties to Wall Street and his potential rollback of banking regulations. #ResistTrumpTuesdays organizer Nelini Stamp, 29, said Trump targeted voters who were hit hardest in the financial crisis by saying he would end government corruption. "He said he was going to drain the swamp and all we see is that he's filling it more and more every week," Stamp, a member of the Working Families Party, told CNBC. "This was never about the American people. This was never about making America great again. It was about rolling back all of the things that Americans have fought for since the financial crisis and ... during the Obama administration," she said. Trump signed two executive orders on Friday to start the process of relaxing regulations on the financial industry. The first order began a review of federal financial regulations including the Dodd-Frank act, a set of banking industry reforms put in place after the 2008 financial crisis in a bid to prevent another financial meltdown. The Treasury Department was tasked with determining whether existing regulation conforms to what Trump called "core principles" of his administration. The second called for a Labor Department review of a rule requiring financial advisors to give their customers advice that is in the client's best interest. The rule is scheduled to start on April 10. Although the orders have not yet resulted in any concrete regulatory rollback, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., condemned Trump on Friday for issuing the orders, saying the moves were hypocritical after a populist campaign in which he vowed to "drain the swamp." She argued that the order targeting the fiduciary rule for financial advisors "will make it easier for investment advisors to cheat you out of your retirement savings." Warren said that those spearheading the Treasury Department review of financial regulations are themselves former Goldman executives: Trump Treasury nominee Steven Mnuchin and the president's top economic advisor, Gary Cohn. Before signing the orders on Friday, Trump met with some of the country's top CEOs, including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, to discuss tax reform, trade, immigration and regulation. Renata Pumarol, 32, a protest organizer with New York Communities for Change, decried Trump's Wall Street ties, telling CNBC that a regulation rollback could put the average citizen in harm's way. "Trump is making it easier for these bankers, for Goldman Sachs, for Chase, to keep robbing ... America," Pumarol said. "We think this is outrageous that he's ... giving (JPMorgan Chase CEO) Jamie Dimon the power to roll back Dodd-Frank, which was basically set in place to protect us." On Friday, Trump said "there's nobody better" than Dimon to consult about financial regulation. Ahead of the protest, Goldman Sachs said: "We respect every individual's rights to assembly and free speech in accordance with laws." In an interview with the New York Times in January, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein brushed off the idea that his firm has any unfair influence on proceedings in Washington. "It's an imprimatur on our firm that we have such good people that the administration wants to hire them," he said. "But the perception that they'll go to Washington and then favor us is false. The reverse is true. They'll bend over backwards to avoid that. They're not going to serve the interests of Goldman Sachs. They have their own careers and reputations to worry about." JPMorgan Chase did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.

By Nicole Rojas February 9, 2017 23:31 GMT US markets closed in the green following promising moves by President Trump regarding taxesReuters US stocks closed in the green on Thursday (9 February) after US President Donald Trump promised a "phenomenal" announcement regarding his tax plan in the next few weeks. The 45th president has vowed to cut taxes, which is expected to have a stimulative effect on asset values. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 118.06 points, or 0.6%, to close at a record 20,172.40. The blue chips gauge managed to hit an intraday all-time high of 20,206.36, according to MarketWatch. Gains were led by Nike Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc, with the help of of Goldman Sachs, which closed up 1.4%. The S&P 500 jumped 13.20 points, or 0.6%, to settle at 2,307.87 after reaching an all-time high of 2,311.08. The index traded within a 1% range for the 38th consecutive session, marking its longest streak on record. Financial sector saw big performers, according to MarketWatch. Morgan Stanley jumped 2.2% and Bank of America Corp saw an increase of 1.8%. Over on the Dow, JP Morgan Chase & Co also rose 1.6%. Energy stocks also saw gains, with a 1.3% rise in the price of crude oil to $53 (£42.40) a barrel. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite hit a closing record for a third straight session, ticking up 32.73 points, or 0.6%, to close at 5,715.18. According to MarketWatch, the last time the three major indexes all closed at records was 25 January. "I think it's a combination of investors feeling more confident that some tax package will get worked on. But I think that we also have lower interest rates recently and solid earnings," Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones, told CNBC. Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth, added: "Those comments about taxes, the markets have been looking forward to that for a while, and that helps. At least we're not talking about Ivanka [Trump]'s dress line over at Nordstrom's." In the latest economic reports, weekly jobless claims dropped by 12,000 to 234,000 and wholesale trade data for December revealed a 1% increase on inventories, CNBC reported. US Treasury yields fell, with the benchmark 10-year yield rising to 2.39% and the short-term two-year yield by 1.18%. Following a sale, the 30-year bonds yielded 3.016%. Gold prices dropped 0.2% to $1,236.80 (£989.44) an ounce. The US dollar surged against a basket of currencies, jumping more than 1% against the yen. By 6.15pm EST (11.15pm GMT), the USD was at £0.80.

'Success usually comes to those who are too busy to be looking for it.' - Henry David Thoreau Home Articles Authors Search About Us HOME / Articles / Captain Hook / Nothing to Lose - Mr. Trump Nothing to Lose - Mr. Trump By: Captain Hook | Thu, Feb 9, 2017 Share Print Email This is an open letter to President Trump, which I hope he both reads and understands. By way of introduction, and something you may or may not be ware of, I penned this piece entitled Braveheart back in November to celebrate your wonderful win, where you were elected the 'hero of the republic and common folk' - their savior from the evil doers. That said, and to set the tone for this open letter to you, please see recent comments from commentary published a few weeks back involving possible increasing vulnerabilities for America due the radical change you profess to be bringing to the table, as follows: "Wouldn't it be 'funny' if China unleashed increasing percentages of its still bountiful currency reserves on gold and silver bullion, with emphasis not on the former, but the latter considering its strategic importance to America's interconnected markets. As you would know from reading my reports on silver throughout the years, silver is not just important to the maintenance of the larger credit bubble - it's everything. The entire financial repression game, with interest rates at center, depend on keeping silver subdued, because of key inter-market relationships with gold (currencies), bonds, and equities, where radical change would unhinge the derivatives markets employed to manage the larger pricing nexus. So if China really wanted to hurt the US, all it has to do is set silver free from its COMEX shackles, the primary price-managing instrument used to keep general prices under control. And there's only one way to do that - buy it all (which they could do with trillions in foreign currency reserves) - or at least make global price differentials so substantial arbitrage becomes a 'no brainer' for the billionaires of the world. Then a 'buying panic' would ensure that would accomplish the same goal - it would clean them out - even JP Morgan's stash. It wouldn't take much if a true panic to accumulate physical silver ever takes hold, where momentum would eventually bring in all varieties of funds (sovereign, hedge, pension, etc.), not to mention the public. It wouldn't take much at all once it gets rolling - especially with Trump shaking things up." Fast foreword to today, Wednesday February 8th, while precious metals continue to understandably push higher given the 'true backdrop', I must point out silver's underperformance to gold again under the guise it's an 'industrial metal', so this is supposed to be understandable because stock market futures are down. Please realize however this is the BS story the bankers want you to believe, all the while selling unlimited amounts of COMEX silver contracts to control the price, as proved in last week's COT numbers. The banks sold silver down mercilessly last week with no fear of reparation, where its price would have performed much better otherwise. The question then arises, 'is this what we should continue to expect with Goldman Sachs in control of the Treasury again?' Where are the regulators Mr. Trump? Are you really 'in charge'? If you are truly concerned with making America great again, you will need to do something about this situation. America's got to take the hit before it's possible to be great again - you need honest markets Mr. Trump - you can take that to the bank. If you don't bring proper price discovery back to the markets, all your efforts will be for naught, because as you know, there's no free lunch. Be truly honest with the people Mr. Trump - we've already got a full quota of fakes. Your legacy will be failure in the end if you don't as you've been targeted as the 'fall guy' anyway. The falling money supply growth rates prove this assertion. Check it out. Your actions on Friday were not encouraging in this regard Mr. Trump. One could think you are attempting to deceive the American people like your predecessors. One could think you are playing 'the game', because you are not draining the swamp. You know - what you promised to do last year. Please tell us another collapse isn't being engineered (to be capitalized on by Wall Street), because it's hard to believe you could be that naïve? If the markets crash, which is inevitable at some point, the people will be looking for a scapegoat, and your many enemies will make sure that goat is you Mr. Trump. First they will run you through the ringer, and then they will attempt to impeach you. So you see, you really have nothing to lose by sticking to your promises - all of them - even the hard ones. Just be honest with the people - they're not stupid as you know (they elected you) - so don't think they won't understand 'truth' and that 'true pricing' needs to be brought back to the table. Because again, you have nothing to lose from such a move, as you are being made the 'designated goat' anyway - the outsider of the enemy within - never mind China. Bring back honest pricing to gold and silver because it's the right thing to do in the rebuilding of Americana - the America you love. The show you have put on so far, while impressive on the surface, lacks real punching power. If you want to fix that, back your blows with real weight, punches that truly hurt the opposition. Playing into their hands by making Middle America more indebted via an accommodative Fed is not the answer because larger bubbles will only burst bigger in the end. And the closer this is to election time the worse for you. Yes, it will take time this way too, and there are risks; but if you are serious about wanting to be in the White House for another four-years after 2020, you have no choice but to take such risks by neutralizing America's enemies now, both foreign and domestic. Otherwise you will just be enriching the oligarchs further - the Beltway and Wall Street parasites - you know - America's enemy from within you promised to neutralize. Bring honest pricing back to America's markets Mr. Trump; because again, as outlined above, for one reason or another, you have nothing to lose.

Also aligning with the markets as a whole, the IMX showed strong investor movement into the financial sector, particularly toward Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) and JPMorgan Chase & Co, (NYSE: JPM). The Fed's decision to raise interest rates late in 2016, the increased strength of the dollar, as well as the looming promise of financial deregulation from the new Trump administration may also have added to the appeal of big banks among investors. 2016's best performing stock continued to be popular among investors, as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) was a net buy from TD Ameritrade investors throughout January. Surprise Standouts The report also singled out Macy's Inc (NYSE: M) and Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE: CHK) as standouts in two sectors that saw a downturn at the start of the year. Both companies were net bought in January, despite reportedly poor retail sales during the holidays and declining price in most energy corporations as the price at the pump remained stable. Selling At The Top Among the securities that saw a selloff in January were Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) who both hit recent highs that month. Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) also saw a lot of sales following what many believe was a stellar year for the companies properties, with the 2016 release of another entry in the Star Wars franchise as well as several Marvel Comics' movies and television series.

This proposed indirect purchaser class action applies to people in numerous states, including Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, and North Carolina. The proposed indirect purchaser classes include individuals and entities in those states who, between 2007 and 2013: Exchanged U.S. dollars for foreign currency with a regional bank or credit union; Banked with a regional bank or credit union and used their debit card abroad or issued foreign wire transfers; Traded stocks on a foreign exchange; Maintained 30.7 accounts and traded foreign futures, options, or commodities; or Purchased other foreign currency-related investments from a party other than one of the Defendants The indirect purchaser plaintiffs allege that beginning as early as 2007 and continuing through at least 2013, some of the world’s largest banks conspired with each other to fix prices and manipulate benchmark exchange rates in the FX market. These benchmark FX rates are used industry-wide in many different financial instruments and FX exchange transactions. By fixing FX rates, these banks increased their profits and decreased the value of their customers’ FX transactions. The defendant banks include Bank of America, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, RBC, RBS, Societe Generale, Standard Chartered, and UBS. This class action seeks to recover damages against those Defendants for alleged violations of the antitrust and consumer protection laws of numerous states. These allegations have been the subject of investigations by multiple U.S., foreign, and international governmental authorities, and the Defendants have already been required to pay over $10 billion in fines to U.S. and European regulators. A related nationwide direct purchaser class action brought against the same Defendants is currently awaiting final approval of settlements totaling over $2 billion.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Feb 9, 2017 at 2:41PM Bank of America's consumer bank still pumps out profits despite the downward trend in its branch count. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. With the growth of digital banking, bank branches have gotten a bad name. This is one reason Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has slashed its branch count by more than 20% since CEO Brian Moynihan took over at the beginning of 2010. Interestingly, though, if you dig into Bank of America's business units, you'll find that its consumer banking segment is its most profitable. It earned $7.2 billion last year, up from $6.6 billion in 2015. That's not only the largest profit in absolute dollars among Bank of America's operating units, as its runner-up global banking segment earned $5.7 billion in net income last year, it's also the most on a relative basis. The consumer banking unit's return on average allocated capital last year was 21%, which is tied for first place with its global wealth and investment management segment. Data source: Bank of America. Chart by author. This doesn't necessarily mean branches are still in vogue. After all, the increased digitization of banking is reflected in the profit Bank of America earns from its consumer bank, the benefits of which are substantial. The North Carolina-based bank says an automated deposit costs 90% less than a deposit done at a branch, and figures from JPMorgan Chase back this up. According to JPMorgan, it costs $0.65 to handle a deposit transaction in a branch, $0.08 per transaction on an ATM, but just $0.03 per mobile deposit. This starts to add up when you consider that Bank of America has more than 21 million active users of its mobile banking app. A full 68% of the bank's deposits are now done without a teller's assistance, either by way of an ATM or remote deposit capture on a smartphone. The net result is that Bank of America has been able to meaningfully cut its expense base. Its average cost per $100 in deposits has dropped by 34% since 2010, the bank noted last year, going from $2.61 to $1.71 as of the first quarter of 2016. As these trends continue, not only should it make Bank of America more profitable, but it will further widen the profitability gulf between its consumer banking unit and the three other operating segments.

By WallaceWitkowski Reporter As U.S. stocks continue stubbornly to carve out records since Donald Trump’s November presidential election victory, financial and industrial stocks remain the clear winners while utilities and consumer staples lag behind. But, it appears the biggest beneficiaries since the election have been Russian stocks. As a benchmark, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.48% has advanced 9.8% since the Nov. 8 election, a span of 62 trading days, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.36%  has risen 7.7% and the Nasdaq COMP, +0.33%  has gained 10%. Since Trump’s Jan. . 20 inauguration (or 14 days of trading), the Dow has gained 1.6%, while the S&P 500 had advanced 1.4% and the Nasdaq has advanced 2.6%. Read: Stock market hits a trifecta of intraday records as energy, banks rally One benchmark however, has at least doubled that performance since the election, namely, the Moscow Exchange, or Micex, made up of Russia’s 50 largest companies. Since the election the Micex has jumped nearly 30% in U.S. dollar terms and nearly 20% using the Russian ruble, according to FactSet data. Since the inauguration, it has gained 5.9% in U.S. dollar terms and 4.9% in rubles. The biggest heavyweights on the Micex, the natural-gas giant Gazprom OGZD, +1.03% Lukoil LKOH, +5.19%  and Sberbank of Russia SBER, -1.07% have generally outperformed their American counterparts. Since Trump won the election, shares of Gazprom have risen 4.8% in local terms, while Lukoil shares have jumped 10% and Sberbank shares have leapt 19%. In comparison, shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +0.83%  have declined 4.7%, Chevron Corp. CVX, +0.70% shares have gained 4.4% over the same period. Shares of the largest U.S. bank by market cap, however, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.23%  have rallied 23%. See: The biggest ETF winners and losers of 2016 A rush into Russian assets is also evidenced by the VanEck Vectors Russia ETF RSX, +1.16% and the iShares MSCI Russia Capped ETF ERUS, +0.89% which have both gained about 17% since the election. While Russian stocks have gained a significant boost since the election, that hasn’t been the case for their Chinese counterparts. Since the election the Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, +0.42% has gained a paltry 1.1% based on the Chinese yuan, but has declined 0.4% in U.S. dollar terms, according to FactSet. Similarly, emerging markets ETFs have lagged behind with the Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF VWO, +0.91%  and the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF EEM, +0.92%  up 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively. Back in the U.S., small-cap stocks have benefited more than their larger counterparts since the election, but not so much since the inauguration. The Russell 2000 index RUT, +0.75%  has gained 14% since the election, but less than 1% since Trump was sworn into office. Since the inauguration, the clear winners have been technology stocks, which lead sectors on the S&P 500 with a 3.6% gain. In turn, tech shares have been paced by a more than 10% gain in Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.23%  shares. On the other hand, the worst performing sector since the election has been energy, which has fallen 3.5% since Trump took office. In subsectors, the worst performing stocks since the election and the inauguration have been textiles, apparel and luxury goods, with declines of 16% and 10% respectively. While the best performing subsector since the election has been trading companies and distributors with a 36% gain, a much more significant gain, in terms of market cap, has been seen in banks with an across the board 24% gain since the election Best performers on S&P 500 since election Company/ ticker % move since election % move since inauguration Nvidia Corp.

Counter-cyclical sectors were the day’s leading gainers while financial stocks took the brunt of the sell-off. WTI crude oil for March delivery settled at $52.34 a barrel, up about 0.3% on the day, even after a government report showed the addition of 13.8 million barrels to the nation’s commercial inventories. April gold added 0.3% on the day to settle at $1,239.50. Equities were headed for a mixed close close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded down 0.19% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up 0.09%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.19%. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage loss ahead of the close Wednesday was JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) which traded down 0.90% at $85.94. The stock’s 52-week range is $52.50 to $88.17. Volume was about 60% below the daily average of around 18.4 million shares. The big bank had no specific news. Exxon Mobil Corp.

And while the initial “Trump bump” for stocks in November and early December was significant, markets have since been mostly stuck: The S&P 500 is up a modest 2% since New Year’s Day, but we are in the longest stretch in market history without a 1% move or more for the benchmark index. It’s mostly because uncertainty is creeping in, and Republicans aren’t doing much to stop it, let alone deliver on campaign promises. But it’s also because of big uncertainty around what’s next for the U.S. dollar. In the words of investment bankers at J.P. Morgan Chase, “erratic policy emissions from the White House” have stoked uncertainty in the U.S. dollar. On one hand, President Donald Trump talks big about protectionist strategies and higher rates, but on the other, he has broken with decades of a strong dollar rhetoric by talking down the greenback. When taken in context of recent immigration policies and saber rattling over trade, it’s setting the stage for a potentially market-shaking move in currency markets over the next several months. So how do you hedge against big swings in currencies — or, if you’re an aggressive trader, how do you profit from the trend? Here are a few accessible ideas that don’t require actual forex trading experience: Currency ETFs provide alternative investments Trading currencies is a high-octane endeavor that is fraught with risk. Just one of the risks is that serious forex trading typically involves a lot of leverage, which sometimes can result in losses even bigger than your initial investment. For most investors, currency ETFs offer an accessible alternative to trading actual currencies. The Guggenheim CurrencyShares family of funds offer a way to play a host of major currencies via exchange-traded funds — and some have done quite nicely lately. For instance, the CurrencyShares Australian Dollar Trust FXA, +0.60%  is up 6% since Jan. 1, vs. 2% for the S&P 500 SPX, +0.36% and the CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust FXY, -0.07%  is up 5%. Both funds are designed to track the strength of their respective currencies vs. the U.S. dollar. Currency ETFs are not risk-free, of course. There’s a 24-hour marketplace that may demand constant attention, as well as the risk of your trade going south without warning simply because politicians have made an unexpected move affecting your currency of choice. How wearable technology can transform health care(1:46) Around 12-15 million people use wearable technology for health care - a market that includes Fitbit, Apple, Samsung and LG. MarketWatch spoke to Kate McCarthy, a health-care analyst that manages a rare disease using an Apple Watch and a service dog. Some investors aren’t looking at currencies as a way to make a fortune, but rather as a hedge in a volatile market with few good alternatives to stocks. In that case, a fund like the relatively stable Guggenheim CurrencyShares Swiss Franc Trust FXF, -0.22%  is worth a look — as is the increasingly popular PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund UUP, +0.12% which is tied to the strength of the U.S. dollar rather than the strength of U.S. stocks. Currency-hedged equity ETFs rise again Some investors have been frustrated in recent years by tactical investments in certain regions that didn’t play out as they expected thanks largely to forex pressures. Consider the run for Japan as “Abenomics” came to the fore. In calendar 2013, the Nikkei 225 index NIK, +2.49%  ran up an amazing 57%; however, the widely held iShares MSCI Japan ETF EWJ, +0.71%  gained only 22% or so. As a result, a host of currency-hedged ETFs have entered the market in the intervening years. One is the iShares Currency Hedged MSCI Japan ETF HEWJ, +0.82% which launched in 2014 and is designed to give exposure to Japanese equities “while mitigating exposure to fluctuations between the value of the Japanese yen and the U.S. dollar,” according to iShares. Such funds fell out of favor in 2015 and early 2016 as the U.S. dollar halted its relentless rise. However, they are rising again in 2017 as investors brace for nationalist policies around the globe, potential trade wars and the resulting big swings in currencies that will follow. According to Bloomberg and State Street data, currency-hedged ETFs saw over $500 million in net inflows in both January and December. This is amid a 12-month trend that shows a net outflow of over $20 billion from currency-hedged investments. That trend is noteworthy, and investors looking overseas should consider follow the pack to hedge against currency fluctuations in their portfolio. A new trade: Dollar-hedged gold Currency-hedged equity funds are making a comeback. But what if you’re looking for diversification into another asset class? State Street Global Advisors, the brand behind the popular SPDR family of ETFs including the bullion-backed SPDR Gold Trust GLD, +0.26% recently launched the first dollar-hedged gold fund listed in the U.S. This new ETF, the SPDR Long Dollar Gold Trust GLDW, +0.37%  , is meant to fight the impact of a strong dollar, which can hold back prices of commodities like gold. Richard Branson: 'Thousands' will go to space soon(2:28) Two years after a fatal accident, Virgin Galactic launched its first successful test flight in September. Richard Branson, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are racing to send tourists to space. Branson talks to MarketWatch about the future of space travel. Consider that while gold prices fell about 5% from the end of 2013 through the end of 2016, from roughly $1,200 to a little under $1,150, State Street claims that “when the effect of a strengthening USD is removed, gold priced in non-US currencies, such as the euro, increased from €873/oz to €1,096/oz, a 25% increase.” Admittedly, that’s this fund’s marketing department cherry-picking a period of tremendous gains for the U.S. dollar vs. a headline loss for gold. But it does illustrate the potential. To say there is market uncertainty in 2017 is a gross understatement. As a result, we’ve seen a pretty nice rally for gold in the last several weeks, with the precious metal up about 10% from its December lows. Untethering that gold trade from the impact of a strong dollar could be very profitable, then. The big question, however, is whether we will see follow-through on policies that will bolster the already impressive greenback even further. With the dollar near 14-year highs against the euro, how much stronger can it really get? Will any stimulus efforts by a Republican Congress offset any gains in the U.S. currency caused by Federal Reserve tightening? And will additional interest-rate increases happen at all? As I said, there’s a lot of uncertainty. But if you want to play a strong dollar and the resurgence of gold, the new GLDW fund provides an interesting tool for your investing toolbox.

After the lira's worst January in almost a quarter of a century, investors have cut exposure to local assets, fearing the central bank was incapable of tackling an inflation upsurge. But Cetinkaya, in a presentation at JPMorgan's London offices on Thursday, was able to point to the central bank's weighted average cost of funding as proof the bank is serious about inflation-targeting. The rate that the bank currently appears to use as the main gauge for borrowing costs in the economy is at 10.38 percent, up more than 200 basis points since the start of the year. People familiar with the matter told Reuters this week rates would stay at those levels until inflation peaked. In London, Cetinkaya confirmed that message, telling his audience of money managers he intended to keep rates around current levels as long as needed, to meet inflation targets and stabilise the lira. Fund managers who attended said they came away not entirely convinced. But they had some sympathy for Cetinkaya, who must balance controlling inflation - currently over 9 percent - with President Tayyip Erdogan's constant demands for lower interest rates. "They're trying to make everyone happy with this framework. That's the challenge," said Claudia Calich, head of emerging debt at M&G Investments, who attended the event. Like most investors, Calich has a lower exposure to Turkish debt than its weight in bond indexes, due to concerns over central bank independence, a fragile lira and a monetary policy clouded by a multitude of rates. At the central bank's last meeting it kept benchmark policy rates unchanged at 8 percent. But it tightened policy by raising overnight lending rates and upped rates on a liquidity window - a lira funding source for banks - to 11 percent. For the time being that may be enough. Societe Generale analysts, for instance, advised clients to buy lira, noting that the central bank's "explicit acknowledgment of accumulating inflationary pressures and expressed commitment to fighting inflation" had steadied the currency. The lira is some 7 percent off record lows, helped by the dollar's retreat in recent days. "(Cetinkaya) mentioned that additional tightening could be a possibility if need be. But would they do it pro-actively or would the currency need to go under pressure again?" Calich added. Appointed last April, Cetinkaya had been deputy governor since 2012 but Thursday's meeting was the first with him for many investors, who crowded into a standing room-only meeting. His lack of formal economics training had made many sceptical about whether he could stand up to Erdogan, whose priority is to accelerate economic growth. One bond fund manager said a gentle audience question about political pressure on the central bank had been deflected. "He was as hawkish as he could have credibly been given the constraint he is under," the fund manager said, requesting anonymity. "He sounded like he knew what the market needed and we knew what constraints the institution operates under," the manager added. "Nothing I heard today makes me more comfortable for the longer term." Little was apparently said about simplifying the policy rate framework, other than that being the bank's eventual aim. But some investors said they were concerned about Cetinkaya's references to a "dynamic monetary policy". "Turkey just needs to tighten monetary policy and hold it for a considerable period of time to ensure inflation begins to moderate. Use of terminology like dynamic implies the tight policy won't be long-lasting," said Tim Ash, senior sovereign strategist at BlueBay.

(Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images) In response to the president’s unprecedented attack on a company declining to do business with a family member, Nordstrom answered President Trump’s accusation that it was treating Ivanka Trump unfairly. “To reiterate what we’ve already shared when asked, we made this decision based on performance,” the company said in a statement. “Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn’t make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now.” In other words, customers are just not into Ivanka. National Retail Federation President and CEO Matthew Shay, in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, gave a measured response. “What we are all seeing is that we’re living in a world with a different kind of chief executive in the White House,” he said. “It’s someone who communicates directly and forcefully and has a strong opinion on issues. We are learning, all of us, I think, how to work in that environment.” That’s one way of putting it. Another is that the president and his aides are inviting corruption. Conway's comments come on the heels of Nordstrom announcing it was dropping Ivanka Trump's clothing line. The #GrabYourWallet campaign, a boycott against Trump's products, says it is a major victory. (Jhaan Elker,Daron Taylor/The Washington Post) Had any federal employee, including a Cabinet official, done what Trump did, he or she would have run afoul of federal ethics regulations, specifically, Title 5, Section 2635.702: An employee shall not use his public office for his own private gain, for the endorsement of any product, service or enterprise, or for the private gain of friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity, including nonprofit organizations of which the employee is an officer or member, and persons with whom the employee has or seeks employment or business relations. . . .  An employee shall not use or permit the use of his Government position or title or any authority associated with his public office in a manner that is intended to coerce or induce another person, including a subordinate, to provide any benefit, financial or otherwise, to himself or to friends, relatives, or persons with whom the employee is affiliated in a nongovernmental capacity. This is garden-variety corruption, of the type we deplore in kleptocratic regimes around the world. Likewise, if an American company consented to hire or do business with a foreign leader’s children in order to grease the skids for business dealings or avoid government retribution it would be a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. As the Financial Times reported recently: JPMorgan has agreed to pay $264m to settle a US probe into its practice of hiring well-connected Chinese “princelings” to win business.  . . . “JPMorgan engaged in a systematic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials and other favored referrals who were typically unqualified for the positions,” said Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC’s enforcement division. “JPMorgan employees knew the firm was potentially violating the FCPA yet persisted with the improper hiring program because the business rewards and new deals were deemed too lucrative.” The White House (falsely) keeps insisting the president cannot have conflicts of interest, neglecting the Constitutional prohibition on receipt of monies from foreign governments. Nevertheless, Congress can and should close the gap in ethics laws given that this president refuses to divest himself of businesses and insists on using the power of his office (during the transition and currently) to benefit his family finances. Perhaps we need a presidential anti-corruption act that would make Title 5, Section 2635.702 applicable to the president and vice president. In any event, both Spicer’s derogatory comments (an attempt to “coerce”) and Kellyanne Conway, who directly hawked Ivanka’s line (“I fully — I’m going to give a free commercial here. Go buy it today, everybody. You can find it online.”), seem to run afoul of existing ethics laws and should be held accountable. There may be other legal avenues as well. Ethics guru Norman Eisen of the Brookings Institution yesterday tweeted that there is a cause of action under California’s Unfair Competition law forbidding “any unfair business act.” Eisen told me this morning, “The law has long recognized that when someone makes untrue statements about a business, and those statements cause harm, a cause of action lies. As it happens, California, which has a lot of Nordstrom’s stores, has one of the most generous laws in the nation in allowing a business to respond when it is the victim of unfair treatment.” He adds, “Interestingly, that law also allows the California attorney general or other public officials to bring an action as well. Nordstrom’s says the president and Mr. Spicer’s  statements were not correct. . . . [T]his was a business decision that was made because Ivanka’s line was not selling, that there was nothing unfair or political about it.” Conveniently, former Democratic congressman Xavier Becerra is now California’s state attorney general.

At the same time, the Republican president, who made anti-Wall Street rhetoric a key part of his campaign message, began laying the groundwork to undo elements of the Dodd-Frank reform law. Don’t worry, though, because Trump has a perfectly clear rationale for his actions: “I have so many people, friends of mine, that have nice businesses and they can’t borrow money. They just can’t get any money because the banks just won’t let them borrow because of the rules and regulations in Dodd-Frank.” In other words, the president is targeting legal safeguards and layers of financial-industry accountability so that his friends can get more money. The comments were certainly candid. But they were also baffling. To the extent that reality matters, commercial lending is actually at record highs right now – even with Dodd-Frank safeguards in place – so it’s not altogether clear what the president is whining about. At the same White House event, Trump turned to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and said, “There’s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank than Jamie.” If you voted for Trump because you thought he’d stand up to Wall Street, I’m afraid you were suckered. But perhaps most alarming of all is the potential impact of this administration’s vision as it relates to the finance industry. Vox’s Matt Yglesias had a good piece on this yesterday, noting that Trump seems determined to encourage Wall Street to engage in more risky lending. Weaker regulation, in other words, will let US-based banks gain more global market share relative to European or Japanese competitors. That’s great if you happen to be a bank shareholder or a bank executive, or have a yearly bonus pegged to bank share prices. But it has nothing to do with creating job opportunities for the long-term unemployed or increasing middle-class wages. There’s no great mystery as to how regulatory policy shaped primarily by the business interests of major banks ends – big profits, big bonuses, and eventually a big crash and a big bailout. But the genius of bank regulation as a policy area is that no matter how badly you screw it up, the odds are that on any given day, there won’t be a financial crisis anyway. A poorly supervised financial system can pile on egregious hidden risks for fun and profit and suffer no obvious bad consequences for years. If it happens to blow up in an election year, of course, you’re screwed. But while dramatic moves on immigration, health care, and budget policy are sure to provoke immediate blowback, on bank regulation, it’s entirely plausible that Trump will sow the seeds of destruction and nobody will notice until reelection is in the rearview mirror. The irony is, financial regulatory reform – which is to say, the safeguards Trump is eager to undo – has been quite effective. The system is more stable; the layers of accountability are preventing unnecessary riskiness; the markets have grown steadily; etc. I’ve heard compelling arguments that policymakers could make existing rules far stronger, but there’s no reason to turn back the clock to a pre-crash framework. Unless, that is, you’re a Republican president worried about your “friends” not having enough money. As for the politics, I think much of the talk about Trump facing a backlash because of betrayals of his campaign principles is probably overstated – his loyalists generally seem unconcerned with the president’s inconsistencies – but I think this is one of the few areas in which Trump and his team really are playing with electoral fire. He swore up and down for months that it was Hillary Clinton who’d do Wall Street’s bidding, while Americans could expect his administration to stand up to the finance industry and its lobbyists. Millions of voters actually believed he’d be “tough” on Wall Street. And now Trump is doing the exact opposite, creating serious economic risks, and doing the exact opposite of what many of his ardent supporters hoped for. The potential for serious consequences – economic and electoral – are real. Explore: The MaddowBlog, Donald Trump, Economy and Wall Street How Senator Strange made it from Alabama...

Kupiec Published February 07 2017, 8:00am EST More in Regulatory relief Basel Jeb Hensarling Print Email Reprints Share Share on Industry critics have charged that House Financial Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling’s regulatory reform bill, known as the Financial Choice Act, is a big-bank giveaway. But if that were true, why do signs point to big banks turning down the gift? In reality, Hensarling’s legislation has appeal for both those who want to unwind the Dodd-Frank Act – including Trump administration officials – and regulatory hawks who want to keep banks in check while protecting taxpayers from bailouts. The bill should be at the center of White House efforts to make financial regulation more efficient. It gives banks a choice: either continue under Dodd-Frank regulations or, alternatively, choose to maintain higher minimum capital – by meeting a higher “leverage ratio” of 10% – in return for being exempt from many Dodd-Frank regulations that are seen as overly burdensome and micromanaging bank operations. The Financial Choice Act, authored by Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, lets banks opt for a tougher capital requirement in exchange for an exemption from Dodd-Frank Act regulations. The largest banks may decline that option. Bloomberg News But the hurdle for getting that regulatory relief is high, which explains why the largest banks are expected – should the bill be enacted – to choose the status quo of Dodd-Frank. A higher “leverage ratio” means banks cannot manipulate regulatory capital with complex risk weights. All instruments are viewed the same. Essentially, this means the largest banks would need to raise boatloads of new capital to meet the new test. The beauty of the Choice Act is it gives bankers the choice of which path to take; either way, the American taxpayers are protected. The core principle of bank regulation is to protect depositors and taxpayers from loss. Higher capital is a means toward this end. The more equity invested in a bank, the smaller the chance the bank will fail, and the less likely it could generate losses for depositors or taxpayers. Hensarling’s bill harnesses the idea that well-capitalized bankers shun imprudent risk-taking and should be allowed more latitude to manage themselves. A well-capitalized bank should be rewarded by removing the costs of complying with a host of unnecessary safety and soundness regulations. When a bank is required to maintain higher shareholder equity, the reduction in leverage changes its incentives. Bank managers naturally become focused on protecting their shareholders’ equity investment. A well-capitalized bank is likely to be a well-managed bank without micromanagement from bank regulators. Industry reactions suggest that the Choice Act would be popular among community banks, but is unlikely to appeal to all banks. Large banks have even expressed appreciation for Dodd-Frank. For example, a 2013 analyst report quoted JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon as saying some Dodd-Frank provisions expand the “moat” that gives banks like his an advantage. That sentiment was echoed more recently by Jeremy Newell, the head of regulatory affairs and general counsel for The Clearing House Association, a trade organization for the largest, most complex banks. In testimony on the Choice Act in July, Newell said that certain Dodd-Frank provisions had fixed regulatory problems identified in the recent financial crisis, and that he supported a “pause before considering additional changes.” The comprehensive leverage ratio is not a risk-weighted capital rule—it treats all risky assets equally. A bank mortgage loan generates the same percentage capital requirement as a startup small-business loan. Critics argue that when equal weights apply to all bank assets, banks are encouraged to load up on risk. Their preferred alternative—the Basel risk-weighted capital measure—assigns a higher risk weight to bank assets that regulators deem to be higher-risk. While that is appealing in theory, there is no evidence that the Basel risk-weight approach is superior in practice. The Basel approach has many well-known shortcomings and indeed many believe that inaccurate Basel risk weightings were a chief cause of the subprime debacle and financial crisis. The risk-weight critique ignores the extra capital required by the Choice Act—twice the minimum bank capital required by Dodd-Frank regulations. Moreover, without Basel’s complex regulatory risk weights, banks that opt for the higher capital test of the Choice Act cannot hide risky exposures using modeling tricks or financial engineering to make risky assets appear safer than they are. Indeed, the Choice Act’s primary appeal is that it allows banks to choose higher capital to eliminate the need to pay legions of financial “experts” and former bank regulators to “optimize” a bank’s regulatory capital models. Bankers will be free to manage their own banks as they see fit. They can focus on lending and customer service, instead of on compliance with unnecessary complex regulatory rules. That said Hensarling’s bill could be still improved. If the Choice Act is to be successful, it must also include comprehensive reform of the process used by bank regulators to respond to undercapitalized institutions – known as “prompt corrective action.” PCA requires regulators to intervene and even close institutions when banks are operating in an unsafe and unsound manner. The Choice Act requires the Government Accountability Office to study possible PCA reforms, but it should go further and impose a new PCA standard synchronized with Hensarling’s bill. When a Choice Act bank falls below the 10% minimum leverage requirement, the September version of the House bill would reinstate required compliance with all Dodd-Frank rules. But imposing costly Dodd-Frank regulations on a weakened bank that can’t raise capital is only going to make consultants wealthy. The bill should be amended to include a PCA requirement for a supervisory rehabilitation plan should the capital of a Choice Act fall below a threshold set in law by Congress. The bill must also strengthen PCA bank closure rules to protect the Deposit Insurance Fund and taxpayers against future losses. With a few minor but important adjustments, the Financial Choice Act is a regulatory solution that protects taxpayers but allows bankers to be bankers instead of compliance clerks. Paul H.

Minyanville SP 500 Valuation: Seems Reasonable Presently and Walking Up SP 500 Earnings Growth By Scutify Feb 09, 2017 8:42 am PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. Seth Klarman, a well-known value investor in a recent letter to clients, talked about "perilously high valuations". In addition, we recently heard from Goldman Sachs on the downside of the so-called "Trump rally". Here is an article from Forbes, detailing some of the latest "bearish calls" on the US stock market, from a number of different perspectives. The following is a spreadsheet kept here at Trinity using JP Morgan's "Guide to the Market" statistics: JPMGTTMSP500Valmeasures Frequently, using "averages" can get you into trouble, but looking at the markets on a number of different valuation metrics, there doesn't seem to anything too alarming about the valuation of the current stock market. No doubt we can find pockets of overvaluation - you can still make a good case for the FANG stocks being overvalued, but that has been the case for some time. Seeking Alpha's website is loaded with negative stories and comments on Amazon and Tesla - both seemingly wildly overvalued stocks based on traditional metrics - although both are "disruptors" for sure in their respective spaces, and both stocks have demonstrated consumer appeal and consistent demand. (Amazon without question, while, with Tesla, a few questions remain.(Long AMZN in many accounts, TSLA in fewer accounts.) Look at the Treasury market: relative to long-term "real" (i.e. inflation-adjusted) rates of return, Treasuries have looked wildly overvalued, maybe the last 8 years, and certainly the last few years. Bond fund inflows totaled $163 billion in 2016, versus negative outflows in stock funds ? Analysis / conclusion: As years have gone by, more and more I put a premium on investor sentiment and looking at the AAII data here. Currently just 33% of individual investors (polled weekly by AAII) are now "bullish". The distribution is evenly divided by 1/3rd's, bullish, bearish and neutral. The hallmark of this bull market off the '09 lows is that the Street and individual investors tend to turn bearish very quickly, the Street has tended to underestimate SP 500 earnings strength (something that has worked fortuitously for this blog), and investors have become complacent about the risks in the bond market. To be sure this isn't a criticism of Seth Klarman or any other investor making a market call. If Seth is a "deep value" investor, his valuation metrics might have called the SP 500 overvalued in June of 2009. Doug Kass, the noted short-seller that writes for Jim Cramer's "TheStreet" would be negative for years, and then very, very right. Doug called the overvaluation in Technology in the late 1990's, and then went long in early 2003, but again looked to flip negative again in June, 2003, roughly 4 years and a few months ahead of the October, 2007, peak. The point is to readers, is that there is a constant stream of opinions on the market and stocks and bonds, put forth everyday to feed the beast that is the mainstream and financial media. The biggest failure - in my opinion- on the part of the individual investor or those "lay people" on Boards of endowments or public pension funds, is that they seem to think there is one person, (Bill Miller, Bill Gross, Peter Lynch, etc), or one firm (i.e. Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, etc.) or one style (growth, versus GARP, versus value, etc.) or one methodology (or one anything, really) that can succeed and deliver out-performance in all markets, but to readers, I say, there is no such beast. Patience and discipline are probably your best investing tools, and play "the long game". My own opinion on "market valuation" using the above JP Morgan valuation spreadsheet is that the SP 500 is simply "walking up" SP 500 earnings growth. There hasn't been too much "P.E expansion" in the last 3 years on the US stock market. The other opinion discussed with client's is that this is a relatively "controlled" bull market, and it is highly likely to continue, and by controlled I mean the complete absence of any real bullish sentiment. This US stock market rally has been hated for years. To conclude, these are just personal opinions, and readers should do your own thinking. A correction could hit the SP 500 at any time from an exogenous shock (or for any other reason really) but long-term investors should use that opportunity to allocate capital to the market. How fiscal policy and tax reform unfolds this year will be critical for the SP 500 in my opinion. That could/should be the next major market catalyst. Thanks for reading.

But the home at 734 Longmeadow St.  overlooking the Longmeadow Green is not on the market, and the New York bank that owns it is mum on future plans. Monson contractor Gary J. Allard has a crew at the Brewer-Young mansion, Longmeadow Town Manager Stephen J. Crane said. He didn't know when work will be completed, and Allard didn't return a call asking for comment. Crane announced in April that the Brewer-Young Mansion would get about $90,000 worth of work to replace, not just shore up, the portico and the work would be paid for by the owner of the home, J.P. Morgan Chase Bank. The town had pushed hard to get the porch roof replaced instead of just made stable. The old roof had rotted away where it stood, giving the appearance of an ugly brown scar across the forehead of the home. This week, realtor Nick Gelfand of NRG Real Estate in Longmeadow said he could confirm that work is being done, but couldn't say much else. He said the house is not on the market. Elizabeth C. Seymour, a spokeswoman for Chase' mortgage banking division in New York, couldn't provide much new information either. "The only update I can offer at this point is that we're still in the process of completing repairs to this property, which should be complete in the near term," she wrote. "I don't have any additional information to share at this point." The mansion was once owned by Ida Young, widow of W.F. Young and the co-inventor with her husband of the Absorbine and Absorbine Jr. liniments. Chase foreclosed on former owner Shahkar M. Fatemni and the mansion in 2014, but the bank was unable to get Fatemni to leave without an eviction order from Western Housing Court in Springfield, which it obtained in October 2015. Built in 1885, the 10,907-square-foot colonial revival has 11 bedrooms and eight bathrooms. It sits on 1.8 acres of land, remnants of what was once extensive grounds, much of which was lost to the construction of Interstate 91. The nearby carriage house, once part of the estate, is no longer part of the property. The mansion boasts a living room-ballroom, marble floors in the front foyer, leather embossed wallpaper on the first floor and  Egyptian-themed murals. Its glassed-in conservatory was based on the Crystal Palace from the London Great Exhibition of 1851. The Rev. Samuel Wolcott, composer of more than  200 Christian hymns, was the first to live in the home. Edward Brewer bought it in 1901. Ida Young bought the home in 1921. She died in 1960 at the age of 95, but the home stayed in the family into the 1990s and changed hands again after that. Fatemni bought the mansion in 2000. The property is assessed by the town at $895,000.

Moody’s Investors Service upgraded its credit outlook on Indonesia sovereign debt to “positive” from “stable” late yesterday and reaffirmed its Baa3 ratings, the lowest notch for investment grade debt. The agency noted that Southeast Asia’s largest economy is now less vulnerable to external shocks and has a lengthening track record of economic stability and fiscal discipline. This followed a similar December move by Fitch, which has an equivalent BBB- rating, and comes as Indonesia’s policymakers seek to attract more foreign investment when emerging market assets globally are under stress. Late last year, the government sanctioned JP Morgan Chase & Co. for downgrading the country’s equity market. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said in January she was concerned the downgrade could fuel a stampede out of the country’s assets. Bank Indonesia Governor Agus Martowardojo said the Moody’s upgraded outlook showed international recognition of the country’s “success in maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability that create a conducive environment for sustainable growth”. Today, Indrawati said the government will continue to strengthen policies to “rationalise risk perception”. Officials have long been hoping for a ratings upgrade from Standard & Poor’s, which has kept Indonesian debts at junk status. Fitch Ratings gave Indonesia an investment grade ratings in 2011 and Moody’s in 2012. Minister’s views But Darmin Nasution, the chief economics minister, said investors should dismiss the fact S&P still has not given an investment grade rating. “We don’t know what (S&P’s) problem is. Its explanations change all the time... If it keeps changing its mind, don’t listen to it,” Nasution told reporters. S&P declined to comment on the difference between its assessment and that of its competitors. In a report in January, S&P said that although the US November election caused some initial weakness in the rupiah, investors have been buying Indonesian bonds. “We continue to see this confidence as contingent upon continued progress in reforms to foreign investment policy, fuel subsidies and ease of doing business,” S&P said. Jean-Charles Sambor, deputy head of emerging market fixed income at BNP Paribas Investment Partners in London, said “Among the three agencies, S&P has been more conservative in its assessment of Indonesia but we expect them to be the next one to upgrade.” Moody’s said key drivers of its change in outlook were smaller current account deficit and higher foreign exchange reserves. Indonesia’s current account deficit in 2016’s last quarter was its smallest in five years, while foreign exchange reserves at end-January were the highest since August 2011. Challenges in revenue collection were highlighted by Moody’s as a risk. The rating agency also warned it could lower the outlook if reform efforts unravel. Moody’s said it would upgrade Indonesia’s ratings if the government reduces reliance on external debt, while at the same time strengthening its financial institutions. Today, Indonesian bonds rallied across the board both in the local currency and dollar bond markets. The rally saw yields falling 6-7 basis points in the rupiah government bonds. The Indonesian sovereign sector has been the best performer in the JPMorgan Asia Credit Index in 2017 with a return of 4.01 per cent. ― Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Amazon warns that trade protectionism could hurt business China regulator still plans oil futures, weighs easing equity curbs Bursa Malaysia to trade higher next week Dollar rises on hopes for Trump tax reform Uber suffers for Trump ties that leave Tesla’s Musk unsullied (VIDEO) If Trump hits China, regional demand would ease blow in Asia Bursa Malaysia opens easier Sri Lanka eyes China free trade deal this year, PM to visit in May Another day, another mall: How KL Gateway Mall hopes to succeed in a crowded market Ringgit opens slightly lower against US dollar Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Indonesia posts US$4.5b surplus in 2016 balance of payments Indonesia’s economy grows less than forecast on spending cut Indonesia’s worried about market ‘psychology’ with JPMorgan report Indonesia considers slapping curbs on negative research by banks Indonesia penalises JPMorgan for rating its bonds ‘underweight’ Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

On Thursday, Indrawati said the government will continue to strengthen policies to "rationalize risk perception". Officials have long been hoping for a ratings upgrade from Standard & Poor's, which has kept Indonesian debts at junk status. Fitch Ratings gave Indonesia an investment grade ratings in 2011 and Moody's in 2012. MINISTER'S VIEWS But Darmin Nasution, the chief economics minister, said investors should dismiss the fact S&P still has not given an investment grade rating. "We don't know what (S&P's) problem is. Its explanations change all the time... If it keeps changing its mind, don't listen to it," Nasution told reporters. S&P declined to comment on the difference between its assessment and that of its competitors. In a report in January, S&P said that although the U.S. November election caused some initial weakness in the rupiah, investors have been buying Indonesian bonds. "We continue to see this confidence as contingent upon continued progress in reforms to foreign investment policy, fuel subsidies and ease of doing business," S&P said. Jean-Charles Sambor, deputy head of emerging market fixed income at BNP Paribas Investment Partners in London, said "Among the three agencies, S&P has been more conservative in its assessment of Indonesia but we expect them to be the next one to upgrade." Moody's said key drivers of its change in outlook were smaller current account deficit and higher foreign exchange reserves. Indonesia's current account deficit in 2016's last quarter was its smallest in five years, while foreign exchange reserves at end-January were the highest since August 2011. Challenges in revenue collection were highlighted by Moody's as a risk. The rating agency also warned it could lower the outlook if reform efforts unravel. Moody's said it would upgrade Indonesia's ratings if the government reduces reliance on external debt, while at the same time strengthening its financial institutions. On Thursday, Indonesian bonds rallied across the board both in the local currency and dollar bond markets. The rally saw yields falling 6-7 basis points in the rupiah government bonds. The Indonesian sovereign sector has been the best performer in the JPMorgan Asia Credit Index in 2017 with a return of 4.01 percent.

(Aramco) has chosen the New York-based boutique investment bank Moelis & Co to advise on its initial public offering, reports say. The sale of the world’s biggest oil company is the latest of several moves by the Saudi government to generate revenues in the face of a gaping budget deficit. Aramco had invited banks in January to pitch for an advisory position on what is expected to be the world's biggest initial public offering.   JPMorgan, which has been Aramco’s commercial banker for years, and Michael Klein, a former star Citigroup banker, had been advising Saudi authorities on the IPO. However, the kingdom’s decision to pick a small banker has surprised many observers. International business outlets such as Bloomberg and the Financial Times said the choice represents a coup for Moelis founded no sooner than 2007. The IPO, which is predicted to raise about $100 billion, is set to yield millions of dollars in fees and push Moelis up in global investment bank rankings. Last year, Moelis hired Shlomo Yanai, a retired Israeli military officer, to join the firm as a senior adviser. Yanai had earlier been offered the directorship of the Israeli spy agency Mossad by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but he turned it down.  The oil giant’s initial public offering, holding $2 trillion in assets, is expected to take place in 2018 with an initial sale of a five-percent share. According to Bloomberg, Aramco expects Moelis to help it select underwriters for the sale, make decisions on potential listing venues and ensure the IPO goes smoothly. Saudi Arabia is currently dealing with a budget deficit of nearly $100 billion caused by a sharp slump in oil prices as well as Riyadh’s rising military expenditure. The kingdom emerged as the world’s third largest military spender in 2015 when it began its military campaign against Yemen. The Saudis have also been forced to introduce a series of austerity measures that include canceling of some bonuses offered to state employees and increasing of entry visa fees for residents and foreigners. The ruling Saudi family will transfer the revenue from the sale of Aramco to the country’s public investment fund (PIF), which will then be tapped to purchase strategic financial and industrial assets abroad.     Join Albawaba Business Follow Albawaba Business Advertisement Copyright © 2016 Press TV.

Major investment banks like Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), HSBC Holdings plc (NYSE: HSBC), and Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C), among others, were also asked last month to make a pitch for the advisory role according to a report at Reuters. Nor is there any lack of banks wanting to get in on underwriting Saudi Aramco’s IPO. Which bank makes a lot of money from the Saudi Aramco IPO is interesting, but not nearly as interesting as the fact of the IPO itself and the amount of disclosure that the company will have to do in order to attract investors. Saudi Arabia currently controls the country’s crude oil reserves, officially listed at 261 billion barrels, and as of last June, the country’s oil minister said that the state would not relinquish control over either output targets or production capacity. That means that the publicly traded company could effectively be a contractor for the Saudi government, and likely be compensated in the same way as any other contractor. That’s just our guess, but until we hear differently, it’s not a bad one. Getting Saudi Aramco’s books in shape for an IPO is focussed on being able to report 2017 financial results in compliance with international standards. The company also plans to show potential investors accounts for 2015 and 2016 according to the same standard, most likely the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Just finding out if, in fact, Saudi Arabia still has 261 billion barrels of proved reserves is a big deal. The company has never held an outside audit of its reserves and there are plenty of people who wonder how the Saudis pump around 10 million barrels a day for decades and yet their proved reserves never change. Seems like a reasonable question to us. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Paul Ausick « Can Whole Foods Turn Itself Around With This Earnings Report?

IBT Media to host AI and Data Science in Capital Markets event The Reserve Bank of India kept its repo rate steady at 6.25% on Wednesday. While the move was unexpected, it is said to be awaiting more clarity on inflation trends and on how the country's economy has been impacted by the recent demonetisation. Economists at JPMorgan were cited by CNBC as saying: "The [RBI] is set to dramatically undershoot its immediate objective of 5% inflation this quarter, which had fuelled expectations for a rate cut today or else in April." Southern rail peace talks with RMT Union set for Valentine's Day Renewed confidence in China's economy also aided the sentiments. Analysts said they were now more optimistic of corporate earnings in the world's second largest economy amid the recent rally in commodity prices coupled with policy tightening measures undertaken by Beijing. "In China we have an overweight view on equities as we see improved corporate earnings outlook with the Chinese PPI (producer price index) turning around from deflation trend," Fan Cheuk Wan, head of investment strategy for Asia at HSBC Private Bank, was quoted as saying by Reuters.

REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci By Luc Cohen and Guillermo Parra-Bernal | BUENOS AIRES/SAO PAULO BUENOS AIRES/SAO PAULO When Argentina launched a tax amnesty program last year to bring billions of dollars back into the country, it found support from an unlikely corner: the banks whose clients had stashed money abroad. President Mauricio Macri had no shortage of motivation to initiate the amnesty plan. Some $400 billion in undeclared funds was being held outside Argentina, the economy was in recession and the government badly needed to boost revenues. He offered residents until the end of March to declare assets and pay a fine to avoid prosecution for tax evasion. But there was an added incentive - one that marked a break with the past and had nothing to do with how the policy was designed. This time wealthy Argentines with offshore accounts at two of the world's largest private wealth managers, JPMorgan Chase & Co and UBS AG, began receiving letters from the banks asking for proof they had declared their assets to tax authorities, three people with knowledge of the situation said. By year's end, Argentines had declared $97.8 billion, and are expected to declare much more by the March deadline. That surpassed initial analyst estimates of $60 billion and dwarfed the $2.6 billion declared in the 2013-2015 amnesty program. "You can only explain this with some help from banks," said Buenos Aires tax lawyer Eduardo Aguilera of RCTZZ Abogados. He said he had clients who received letters from JPMorgan and UBS as well as other clients who had been encouraged to participate through more informal conversations with bankers at Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co. The banks declined to comment. It is unclear how much of the tally can be attributed to the involvement of the banks. But more than a half dozen people involved in amnesty programs - including lawyers and accountants - said the banks were instrumental in the effort. They described similar actions by the banks in recent amnesty programs run by Brazil and Chile. Those efforts mark a turnaround from banks' more passive approaches toward earlier tax amnesty programs, and reflect a growing sensitivity to stricter regulations and perceptions they could be abetting tax evasion. "They have decided to stop helping clients to hide money," said Miami-based lawyer Martin Litwak, founder of Litwak & Partners, which has advised clients participating in tax amnesties across the region and had Argentine clients who received letters from JPMorgan and UBS. He said the letters from banks ask clients to confirm that their assets are declared, sometimes requiring certification from an accountant or lawyer, and for permission to exchange information regarding their account with authorities. "The banks play a fundamental role. If the banks are not involved, there's nothing the government can do or say to convince people to participate," Litwak said. FAMILY PANIC The shifting dynamics around amnesty programs can be attributed to two equally powerful forces: stricter rulemaking and public outrage. Across Latin America, many wealthy residents have long resented paying high taxes for what they considered to be substandard public hospitals and poor public education. Then there was the government corruption, the potential for hyperinflation and fears their savings could be confiscated. All that could be avoided by stashing money in offshore accounts, set up by banks and out of reach of their home country's tax collectors. Tax amnesty programs launched by cash-strapped governments to draw back the funds generated little enthusiasm. "We had other tax amnesties, but this time there's a much broader transparency framework in the world," said Humberto Bertazza, a partner at Buenos Aires accounting firm Bertazza Nicolini Corti & Asociados. Government crackdowns on tax evasion began in the aftermath of the 2008 U.S. financial crisis. The United States passed the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act in 2010, requiring foreign financial institutions to share information on U.S. citizens with overseas accounts with the U.S. government. Brazil, Chile and Colombia signed on in 2014, and have reciprocity agreements in which U.S. authorities send those governments information on their citizens' assets in the United States. Argentina has taken steps to follow. Latin American countries reached additional agreements to share information with one another - and with traditional tax havens like Switzerland, under the auspices of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Then came the Panama Papers, a massive leak of offshore financial data. The revelations in the documents, released last year, exacerbated public outrage over the extent to which the rich and powerful masked their wealth through hidden accounts. The previous year, Brazil had been rocked by revelations that 6,000 Brazilians held secret accounts at HSBC Holdings Plc's Swiss private banking unit. "I convinced several of my clients just by saying, 'They're going to like you more back where your bank is located when you send them proof that you got into the amnesty,'" Aguilera said. When Brazil launched its amnesty program last year, wealth management executives at UBS, Pictet Group AG and Credit Suisse Group were instructed to tell clients to declare their secret accounts and join the country's amnesty program, three people with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters. Some banks went further. Clients who wanted to remain outside the program in Brazil were told in some cases to move their money to another bank, one of the people familiar with the tax amnesty said. "Our lawyer and our family's banker basically told us to disclose every single offshore asset we have, and they said so in a way that panicked the entire family," said a Sao Paulo-based client of UBS Private Bank in Switzerland, who asked for anonymity to speak about the issue. "It cost us dearly but now we understand why the pressure was big on us to do this."

Europe’s largest bank aims to make three or four acquisitions globally this year, with a particular focus on China, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the strategy isn’t public. The targets would be portfolios of assets or platforms allowing the bank to offer a wider range of products, rather than sizeable asset-management companies, the people said. A bank spokesman declined to comment on HSBC’s strategy in the sector. International banks have been growing their wealth and asset management arms as balance-sheet lending and securities trading become less profitable under new capital rules. Led by Mary Callahan Erdoes, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s asset-management unit has grown to oversee about $1.7 trillion globally and set up a money manager in Shanghai last year. Swiss lenders UBS Group AG and Credit Suisse Group AG are pulling back from investment banking in Europe and shifting resources to the higher potential returns in Asian wealth management. Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up Chief Executive Officer Stuart Gulliver has been under pressure to streamline HSBC, the biggest provider of trade finance in the world, after profitability declined and the share price flagged. The lender is in the middle of a program started in June 2015 to redeploy as much as $150 billion of assets to Asia and hire 4,000 people in the Pearl River Delta region around Hong Kong, where Gulliver pledged to “capture growth opportunities” in asset management. Asia Growth Wealth products, including asset management, accounted for 10 percent of HSBC’s total revenue in the first nine months of 2016. Revenue from that business dropped 13 percent from a year earlier to $3.9 billion, including $718 million from asset management. The bank is set to report full-year results later this month. Growth in the business may be a boon to retail banking and wealth management chief John Flint, seen as a candidate to succeed to Gulliver, who may step down in the next few years. Flint told investors in a presentation in October that the asset management business would shift its focus to Asia and that the unit had the “potential for selective acquisitions to strengthen franchise.” The bank said it increased assets under management in Asia by 15 percent to $145 billion at the end of September, making up more than one-third of the $416 billion total the unit oversees. That put it on track to meet its goal of boosting Asian assets under management by 10 percent a year through 2017 as part of Gulliver’s broader plan for the bank.

The Nasdaq Composite Index eked out gains to finish at a record for a second day in a row Wednesday, but weak financial stocks dragged the Dow Jones Industrial Average lower in a session where the major indexes mostly hugged the flatline. The Nasdaq COMP, +0.33%  rose 8.24 points, or 0.2%, to close at 5,682.45, and the Dow DJIA, +0.48% fell 35.95 points, or 0.2%, to end at 20,054.34. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.23% Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +0.48%  and Visa Inc. V, +0.37%  were notable decliners. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.36% edged up 1.59 points to finish at 2,294.67. Utilities and real estate shares topped the gains while financials were big losers. Financial stocks were pressured by falling yields, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note’s yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% earlier touching a three-week low at about 2.33%. Low yields tend to hurt banks’ business models. “The market [is] trying to come to terms with whether the new administration and Congress will be able to work together effectively or not,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. “Most of the positive expectations were based on the assumption that we were at the end of the gridlock era, and that the Trump administration and Republican Congress would work together.” Events of the recent week have called that notion into question and the possible repeal of Dodd-Frank is looking less likely, he added. The financial sector had surged more than 16% in the wake of the U.S. presidential election on forecasts that interest rates will rise under President Donald Trump’s expansionary policies and expectations for deregulation in the industry.

Watch this chart “The market is on a pause, as some people are now doubting that Trump’s tax reforms will be go through this year,” said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist at Voya Financial. “However, the market is likely to continue to grind higher because the economic background is good and earnings are growing, regardless of whether we will get any fiscal stimulus or not,” Cavanaugh said.

LOUIS, Feb. 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Peabody Energy announced today that it has successfully priced a senior secured term loan and, in response to strong demand, has upsized the term loan to $950 million from $500 million. The term loan, together with $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2022 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2025, brings Peabody Energy's expected total long-term debt capitalization upon emergence from bankruptcy to $1.95 billion, consistent with the total debt structure contemplated by the company's plan of reorganization. The term loan facility will mature in 2022 and bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 4.50% per annum, with a 1.00% LIBOR floor. The facility is being arranged by Goldman Sachs Bank USA, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as joint lead arrangers, and Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. serving as a co-documentation agent, in connection with the restructuring of Peabody Energy as part of the Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri on Jan. 27, 2017. The obligations of Peabody Energy under the term loan facility will be jointly and severally, and fully and unconditionally, guaranteed on a senior secured basis by substantially all of Peabody Energy's current and future direct or indirect U.S. subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions).  The term loan will also be secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of Peabody Energy's tangible and intangible assets (subject to certain exceptions). The term loan is expected to close on April 3, 2017, concurrent with the anticipated effective date of Peabody Energy's plan of reorganization and subject to court approval. The proceeds from the term loan will be used to fund a portion of the distributions to creditors provided for under the plan of reorganization. Peabody Energy is the world's largest private-sector coal company and a Fortune 500 company.  The company serves metallurgical and thermal coal customers in 25 countries on six continents. Certain statements included in this release are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company uses words such as "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "may," "forecast," "project," "should," "estimate," "plan," "outlook," "target," "likely," "will," "to be" or other similar words to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date the release was filed and are based on numerous assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable, but these assumptions are open to a wide range of uncertainties and business risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These factors are difficult to accurately predict and may be beyond the Company's control. Factors that could affect the Company's results include, but are not limited to: the Company's ability to obtain bankruptcy court approval with respect to motions or other requests made to the bankruptcy court in connection with the Company's voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code (the Chapter 11 Cases), including maintaining strategic control as debtor-in-possession; the Company's ability to negotiate, develop, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization; the effects of the Chapter 11 Cases on the operations of the Company, including customer, supplier, banking, insurance and other relationships and agreements; bankruptcy court rulings in the Chapter 11 Cases as well as the outcome of all other pending litigation and the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases in general; the length of time that the Company will operate under Chapter 11 protection and the continued availability of operating capital during the pendency of the proceedings; risks associated with third-party motions in the Chapter 11 Cases, which may interfere with the Company's ability to confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization and restructuring generally; increased advisory costs to execute a plan of reorganization; the impact of the New York Stock Exchange's delisting of the Company's common stock on the liquidity and market price of the Company's common stock and on the Company's ability to access the public capital markets; the volatility of the trading price of the Company's common stock and the absence of correlation between any increases in the trading price and the Company's expectation that the common stock will be cancelled and extinguished upon confirmation of a proposed plan of reorganization with no payments made to the holders of the Company's common stock; the Company's ability to continue as a going concern including the Company's ability to confirm a plan of reorganization that restructures the Company's debt obligations to address liquidity issues and allow emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases; the risk that the plan of reorganization may not be accepted or confirmed, in which case there can be no assurance that the Chapter 11 cases will continue rather than be converted to Chapter 7 liquidation cases or that any alternative plan of reorganization would be on terms as favorable to holders of claims and interests as the terms of the plan of reorganization filed by the Company; the Company's ability to use cash collateral; the effect of the Chapter 11 Cases on the Company's relationships with third parties, regulatory authorities and employees; the potential adverse effects of the Chapter 11 Cases on the Company's liquidity, results of operations, or business prospects; the Company's ability to execute its business and restructuring plan; increased administrative and legal costs related to the Chapter 11 Cases and other litigation and the inherent risks involved in a bankruptcy process; the cost, availability and access to capital and financial markets, including the ability to secure new financing after emerging from the Chapter 11 Cases; the risk that the Chapter 11 Cases will disrupt or impede the Company's international operations, including the Company's business operations in Australia;

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 8 February 2017 by Military News Peabody Energy Announces Upsize And Pricing Of $950 Million Senior Secured Term Loan Facility ST. LOUIS, Feb. 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Peabody Energy announced today that it has successfully priced a senior secured term loan and, in response to strong demand, has upsized the term loan to $950 million from $500 million. The term loan, together with $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2022 and $500 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due 2025, brings Peabody Energy’s expected total long-term debt capitalization upon emergence from bankruptcy to $1.95 billion, consistent with the total debt structure contemplated by the company’s plan of reorganization. The term loan facility will mature in 2022 and bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 4.50% per annum, with a 1.00% LIBOR floor. The facility is being arranged by Goldman Sachs Bank USA, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as joint lead arrangers, and Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. serving as a co-documentation agent, in connection with the restructuring of Peabody Energy as part of the Second Amended Joint Plan of Reorganization filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Missouri on Jan. 27, 2017. The obligations of Peabody Energy under the term loan facility will be jointly and severally, and fully and unconditionally, guaranteed on a senior secured basis by substantially all of Peabody Energy’s current and future direct or indirect U.S. subsidiaries (subject to certain exceptions).  The term loan will also be secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of Peabody Energy’s tangible and intangible assets (subject to certain exceptions). The term loan is expected to close on April 3, 2017, concurrent with the anticipated effective date of Peabody Energy’s plan of reorganization and subject to court approval. The proceeds from the term loan will be used to fund a portion of the distributions to creditors provided for under the plan of reorganization. Peabody Energy is the world’s largest private-sector coal company and a Fortune 500 company.  The company serves metallurgical and thermal coal customers in 25 countries on six continents. Certain statements included in this release are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company uses words such as „anticipate,” „believe,” „expect,” „may,” „forecast,” „project,” „should,” „estimate,” „plan,” „outlook,” „target,” „likely,” „will,” „to be” or other similar words to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date the release was filed and are based on numerous assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable, but these assumptions are open to a wide range of uncertainties and business risks that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These factors are difficult to accurately predict and may be beyond the Company’s control. Factors that could affect the Company’s results include, but are not limited to: the Company’s ability to obtain bankruptcy court approval with respect to motions or other requests made to the bankruptcy court in connection with the Company’s voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the U.S. Code (the Chapter 11 Cases), including maintaining strategic control as debtor-in-possession; the Company’s ability to negotiate, develop, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization; the effects of the Chapter 11 Cases on the operations of the Company, including customer, supplier, banking, insurance and other relationships and agreements; bankruptcy court rulings in the Chapter 11 Cases as well as the outcome of all other pending litigation and the outcome of the Chapter 11 Cases in general; the length of time that the Company will operate under Chapter 11 protection and the continued availability of operating capital during the pendency of the proceedings; risks associated with third-party motions in the Chapter 11 Cases, which may interfere with the Company’s ability to confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization and restructuring generally; increased advisory costs to execute a plan of reorganization; the impact of the New York Stock Exchange’s delisting of the Company’s common stock on the liquidity and market price of the Company’s common stock and on the Company’s ability to access the public capital markets; the volatility of the trading price of the Company’s common stock and the absence of correlation between any increases in the trading price and the Company’s expectation that the common stock will be cancelled and extinguished upon confirmation of a proposed plan of reorganization with no payments made to the holders of the Company’s common stock; the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern including the Company’s ability to confirm a plan of reorganization that restructures the Company’s debt obligations to address liquidity issues and allow emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases; the risk that the plan of reorganization may not be accepted or confirmed, in which case there can be no assurance that the Chapter 11 cases will continue rather than be converted to Chapter 7 liquidation cases or that any alternative plan of reorganization would be on terms as favorable to holders of claims and interests as the terms of the plan of reorganization filed by the Company; the Company’s ability to use cash collateral; the effect of the Chapter 11 Cases on the Company’s relationships with third parties, regulatory authorities and employees; the potential adverse effects of the Chapter 11 Cases on the Company’s liquidity, results of operations, or business prospects; the Company’s ability to execute its business and restructuring plan; increased administrative and legal costs related to the Chapter 11 Cases and other litigation and the inherent risks involved in a bankruptcy process; the cost, availability and access to capital and financial markets, including the ability to secure new financing after emerging from the Chapter 11 Cases; the risk that the Chapter 11 Cases will disrupt or impede the Company’s international operations, including the Company’s business operations in Australia; competition in the coal industry and supply and demand for the Company’s coal products, including the impact of alternative energy sources, such as natural gas and renewables, global steel demand and the downstream impact on metallurgical coal prices, and lower demand for the Company’s products by electric power generators; the Company’s ability to successfully consummate planned divestitures, including the planned sale of the Metropolitan Mine; the Company’s ability to appropriately secure its obligations for reclamation, federal and state workers’ compensation, federal coal leases and other obligations related to the Company’s operations, including its ability to utilize self-bonding and/or successfully access the commercial surety bond market; customer procurement practices and contract duration; the impact of weather and natural disasters on demand, production and transportation; reductions and/or deferrals of purchases by major customers and the Company’s ability to renew sales contracts; credit and performance risks associated with customers, suppliers, contract miners, co-shippers, and trading, bank and other financial counterparties; geologic, equipment, permitting, site access, operational risks and new technologies related to mining; transportation availability, performance and costs; availability, timing of delivery and costs of key supplies, capital equipment or commodities such as diesel fuel, steel, explosives and tires; impact of take-or-pay arrangements for rail and port commitments for the delivery of coal; successful  implementation of business strategies, including, without limitation, the actions the Company is implementing to improve its organization and respond to current industry conditions;  negotiation of labor contracts, employee relations and workforce availability, including, without limitation, attracting and retaining key personnel; the Company’s ability to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants in various agreements; changes in postretirement benefit and pension obligations and their related funding requirements; replacement and development of coal reserves; effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates (primarily the Australian dollar); effects of acquisitions or divestitures; economic strength and political stability of countries in which the Company has operations or serves customers; legislation, regulations and court decisions or other government actions, including, but not limited to, new environmental and mine safety requirements, changes in income tax regulations, sales-related royalties, or other regulatory taxes and changes in derivative laws and regulations; the Company’s ability to obtain and renew permits necessary for the Company’s operations;  litigation or other dispute resolution, including, but not limited to, claims not yet asserted; terrorist attacks or security threats, including, but not limited to, cybersecurity threats; impacts of pandemic illnesses; and other risks detailed in the Company’s reports filed with the SEC. The Company does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements except as required by law.  As outlined in the plan of reorganization, our equity securities will be cancelled and extinguished upon confirmation of a plan of reorganization by the bankruptcy court, and holders thereof will not be entitled to receive, and will not receive or retain, any property or interest in property on account of such equity interests.

Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 8 February 2017 by Military News Channeling Wisdom: Danielle Holly, CEO of Common Impact SOURCE: Common Impact DESCRIPTION: Originally published by YNPN Boston About Danielle: Danielle Holly is dedicated to creating previously unseen pathways for individuals to meaningfully contribute to making their communities thrive. She envisions a world where every person is able to bring their values and personal mission to their day jobs, integrate healthy and sustainable personal lives and, as a result, have the drive and energy to make our communities more equitable and vibrant.  She is currently the CEO of Common Impact. Danielle has helped numerous corporations and nonprofits navigate the new era in skills-based volunteering, including global powerhouses JPMorgan Chase, Charles Schwab, Marriott International, and State Street.  Danielle also writes for Nonprofit Quarterly on strategic corporate engagement. She has served on the Board of Directors for the Young Nonprofit Professionals Network, the Young Nonprofit Professionals Network of Boston, and Net Impact NYC. Twitter: @dholly8 We asked Danielle to share the nonprofit leadership wisdom she has gained over her career.  What is your leadership style? My leadership style tends to be direct and transparent. In most situations, the more people that know about what’s happening, and the more active real-time feedback you provide, the closer you’ll get to solving a challenge in the right way. As I’ve risen to higher levels of leadership, I’ve needed to calibrate that a bit and figure out how and when to share new information with the team. Separately, I set high expectations for the team and even higher benchmarks for myself. I try to be as supportive as I can be to enable the team to meet those expectations, without lowering the bar for the communities we serve. Can you share an example of a time when you successfully led a team through a challenging time or scenario? When I took over as CEO of Common Impact, the organization was going through a period of great transition. The founder had recently left, the organization hadn’t received funding in about a year, and the team was nervous about the future of the organization. I had to quickly communicate confidence in the organization, set a path forward, and get folks reinvigorated to be a part of the team that would lead us through a challenging time. I still look back fondly on the team that rolled up their sleeves for the organization during that period – we wouldn’t be here without them!    How did your experience volunteering with YNPN Boston prepare you for your current leadership role? When I stepped into my role as Chair of YNPN Boston years ago, it was the first time I needed to look across a full organization, and quickly and deeply understand its strengths, its weaknesses, its people, and its services. It’s an experience I call on often when I’m approaching a new problem or consulting engagement. It also introduced me to the types of professionals I knew I wanted to surround myself with in my career – smart, humble, and driven.   What leadership resources have you found useful? Joining the boards of YNPN and Net Impact were great learning experiences for me. A few books that I’ve come across that have stuck with me are The Ariel Group’s Leadership Presence and Difficult Conversations by Douglas Stone.     How has the nonprofit landscape changed since you started working in it? What skills will emerging leaders need that weren’t in demand when you first started? The nonprofit sector has lost its monopoly on social impact work. When I first began my career, if you wanted to have “meaning” in your work, you looked to the nonprofit sector. If you wanted to make money, you went to work for a company. Those lines are much more blurred now, and it demands that the nonprofit sector, its staff. and supporters rise to meet the competition for the purpose driven workforce.   What advice do you have for nonprofit professionals trying to build their leadership? Aggressively pursue the area of leadership that most frightens you. Whether it’s the financial reporting, public speaking, or people management, be ferocious in seeking out opportunities to build those muscles. Whether or not you end up enjoying them or pursuing a career that incorporates those particular skills, it teaches you how to learn, how to be courageous, and ultimately how to manage the people on your team that are leading different areas of work.

Sentiment see-sawed during the session but eventually turned positive late in the afternoon, pushing the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index and the broader All Ordinaries Index each 0.2 per cent higher, to 5664.6 points and 5717.7 points respectively.  Earnings season continued to give investors company direction with the likes of AMP, AGL Energy and Suncorp reporting.  "One of the early themes from the reporting season seems to be that low expectations have been baked in to share prices, and when results are not as bad as anticipated, we are seeing buyers enter," said Romano Sala Tenna, portfolio manager at Katana Asset Management.  "Given the 'brutality' of the past quarter, many investors are not prepared to roll the dice ahead of a company reporting; preferring to wait for the results before buying or adding." Shares in AMP bumped up 3.9 per cent, despite the company announcing a bottom line loss for the year to December of $344 million, down from a profit of $972 million in 2015. But investors were heartened by a $500 million share buyback. AGL enjoyed a 4.4 per cent lift after it reported revenue rose 7.7 per cent and net profit after tax was $325 million, up from a $449 million loss in 2016.  And Suncorp reported a net profit after tax of $537 million for the six months ended December 31, up from $530 million a year earlier, after top-line growth of 4.3 per cent. Shares closed 0.9 per cent higher. Investors scooped up profits in the big resource giants, with BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto both sinking 1.2 per cent and 0.7 per cent respectively. Despite a slight pick up in the iron ore price, investors sold off Fortescue Metals, which closed down 3.6 per cent.  The big four banks were a mixed bag, with only National Australia Bank managing to eke out any gains.  In other equities news, Paragon Care shares plunged 11.7 per cent after it's first-half results disappointed, given the earnings-per-share declined around 4 per cent due to the large number of shares that were issued last year to fund acquisitions.  3:16pm on 9 Feb 2017 Uncertainty over US President Donald Trump's policies has driven up gold prices, but the effect may be limited to the short-term only, the head of Australia's biggest gold miner Newcrest Mining says. Gold prices have risen to three-month highs above $US1240 an ounce amid worries over the impact of Trump's protectionist policies and political risks in Europe ahead of a string of elections. "What I think he's done, at least for the moment, is introduce a level of uncertainty that wasn't necessarily there before he took over," Newcrest chief executive Sandeep Biswas told reporters after speaking at the Melbourne Mining Club. Investors, unsure of what may happen under Trump, were maintaining positions in gold as a traditional store of value rather than due to any structural shift, he said. "I don't think there's any policies that we've seen at this stage that would lead me to believe that it's good or bad in the medium or long term for gold," said Biswas, who started following Trump on social media last week to "keep up with what he's up to." Newcrest, whose shares have jumped 52 per cent over the past year, is due to report half-year results on February 13. What's he up to? Newcrest CEO Sandeep Biswas has started following Donald Trump on Twitter. Photo: Jesse Marlow 3:04pm on 9 Feb 2017 Looks like some short sellers in Mayne Pharma are getting burnt.  The stock is up another 4.1 per cent at $1.39, taking the two-day gains close to 10 per cent. Mayne shares have been heavily shorted, with nearly 10 per cent of the outstanding stock held by short sellers, ever since the generic drug maker late last year first was investigated by the US Department of Justice over the marketing and sales of its products and then became the target of a US price fixing lawsuit. Mayne Pharma argued the legal proceedings would not have a material impact on future earnings, but the shorters obviously disagree.   2:36pm on 9 Feb 2017 A look next door: Moody's has upgraded its credit outlook on Indonesia to "positive" from "stable", praising its progress on reforms and its efforts to keep finances under control despite falling prices for its main commodity exports. Moody's upgrade follows a similar move by Fitch in December, and comes at a welcome time for Indonesia's policymakers as they seek to attract and retain more foreign investment as emerging market assets globally come under stress. Indonesia's rupiah currency and its main stock index edged up in early trade. Outlook upgrades typically mean a country is closer to a ratings upgrade, which would allow it to sell government bonds at lower rates and attract more foreign investors. ANZ head of Asian research Khoon Goh said he wasn't surprised by the decision. "Indonesia's greatly improved resilience was put to the test in Q4 2016 amid the global bond selloff and the Trump tantrum," Goh said. "Outflows from the Indonesian bond market was short-lived, and inflows resumed in December-January totalling USD2.2bn, even as other Asian markets continued to see outflows." Moody's reaffirmed its rating of Baa3 for Indonesia, its lowest notch for investment grade debt, while noting it is now less vulnerable to external shocks and has a lengthening track record of economic stability and fiscal discipline. 2:25pm on 9 Feb 2017 Donald Trump's honeymoon with investors may come to a premature end, as his frequent Twitter outbursts help kill off the initial burst of euphoria, according to Herald Van Der Linde, HSBC's head of equity strategy for the Asia-Pacific region. While leaders such as Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and India's Narendra Modi enjoyed comparatively lengthy periods of market strength after taking office, the US optimism that welcomed Trump's surprise victory in November shows signs of fizzling less than a month into his four-year term. "The expectations of the markets seem to be higher than what, very often, politicians can promise," Van Der Linde told Bloomberg. With regard to Trump, "the reality check might come sooner," he said. That's "maybe because we see part of the internal workings of what happens in the White House on Twitter - so we see some of the struggles that go on coming on the Twitter feed." With Trump, the "reality check might come sooner as some of the policies - the travel ban etc - is more difficult to implement than the markets anticipated, or the Trump administration anticipated." The S&P 500 Index has edged up 1 per cent since Trump's January 20 inauguration, paling in comparison with the 4.6 per cent surge it experienced from the November 8 election through to the end of the year. The index's advance has slowed as Trump stumbled out of the gate with a flurry of executive orders including a travel ban on immigrants from seven countries that has been suspended by a Seattle judge. The local ASX200 is flat since the inauguration and down 0.3 per cent in 2017, but has still gained more than 7 per cent since the US election. Reality check for markets. Photo: AP Back to top 2:18pm on 9 Feb 2017 Iron ore futures in China are trading higher again, rising for six out of eight sessions, with values underpinned by a weaker US dollar and signs of strong demand in world's top steel consumer China. Resumption of construction activity after the Lunar New Year break is boosting demand for steel and other raw materials, analysts said. "On Tuesday and Wednesday we saw iron ore transactions in the spot market as buyers are restocking after the holidays," said Wang Di, an analyst at CRU consultancy in Beijing. "Another reason could be weakness in the US dollar." Investors in the iron ore market expect economic data in the coming weeks to show the world's second-largest economy got off to a good start in 2017. Steady growth is giving the central bank room to slowly tighten monetary policy and contain the risks from high levels of debt. The market will seek further direction from trade data due on Friday. Iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange is up 1.7 per cent at 646.5 yuan ($US94.12), while the most-active rebar contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was up 1.1 per cent at 3234 yuan. The spot price for iron ore gained 0.3 per cent to $US83.53 on Wednesday night. China's foreign exchange regulator said on Wednesday that risks from cross-border capital flows will be generally under control in 2017, a day after the country reported that its forex reserves had fallen to near six-year lows. Chinese authorities have taken a raft of steps in recent months to curb capital flight from the country to support its weakening yuan currency, while trying to bring in more foreign investment. 1:45pm on 9 Feb 2017 Households, particularly those in Queensland and Western Australia, will see some benefits from the lift in commodity prices, HSBC says. A marked and largely unexpected lift in commodity prices, particularly of iron ore and coal, has lifted Australia's export revenues, pushing the trade surplus to its most positive position on record.  But some economists have argued the impact on households is likely to be subdued, given continuing weaknesses in the consumer economy.  Any lift to households would be "less potent than we've seen in recent cycles," HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham said. "But we still think there will be some effect." Households will gain some benefit from the rising fortunes of mining companies through two mechanisms, Bloxham said. State governments, particularly in the mining-rich states of Western Australian and Queensland, will see a lift in state royalties, which will, in part, flow through to government spending and public sector wages. And the higher profits of mining companies themselves will provide a private-sector boost, flowing through to wages and spending. "The key point here is we've had this long period where the resources sector has been a headwind to growth," Bloxham said. "That's been most vivid in WA and Queensland." "That headwind has turned into a tailwind. It should start to support conditions in those two states that have been under a fair bit of pressure recently."   1:23pm on 9 Feb 2017 Australian apartment developers are ramping up vendor financing for foreign buyers, in an effort to fill the funding gap left by major Australian banks.  Melbourne developer Beulah International, Sydney's Eklipse Capital, and Brisbane's Golden State Property Developments are the latest developers to offer financing to foreign buyers, particularly Chinese buyers when they acquire their apartments.   Foreign buyers have been still struggling to get funding since the major banks stopped foreign loans last year, resulting in the number of buyers falling up to 50 per cent in the past 12 months, real estate agents said.  More vendor financing will also be welcome relief for many would-be investors in the apartment market after CBA, the nation's biggest property lender,  announced it will indefinitely suspend new finance applications for some investment home loans on Wednesday.  Melbourne's Beulah is offering a facility, through the use of licensed brokers, to provide long term loans to foreign buyers. The loans will be sourced from the developer's balance sheet and other private high net worth backers including those from overseas.  While the developer was still finalising details of its loans, it said it would charge interest rates of around 6 per cent to 7 per cent.  Here's more at the AFR Melbourne developer Beulah International is offering vendor financing for projects such Garden Hill in Doncaster.  1:10pm on 9 Feb 2017 Gold was the biggest income driver for Australia in 2016, surpassing even iron ore, CommSec notes. Gold exports rose by 30 per cent in 2016, adding $4.4 billion to export receipts, while iron ore exports rose by 8.4 per cent over the year, adding $4.1 billion to Australia's foreign revenue, chief economist Craig James said. "Australian gold exporters remain amongst the most efficient in the world and the challenge remains to keep production costs down to support margins and profitability," he said. The All Ordinaries gold index has risen more than 40 per cent from recent lows in mid-December. Spot gold is hovering just below three-month highs of $US1244 an ounce the precious metal hit overnight. Political uncertainty around the French elections and Greek debt crisis, as well as controversy over US President Donald Trump's temporary travel ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries have recently boosted gold as a safe-haven asset. "Perhaps the most important factor however, is the complete lack of any coherent economic policy from the new US administration," says OANDA managing director Illka Gobius. "This has taken the wind out of the post-election Trump-flationista's." 12:49pm on 9 Feb 2017 Casino giant Crown will expand its Southbank site to eight hectares after it won approval from the Andrews government to build a $1.75 billion 90-storey tower. Once completed it will be Melbourne's tallest building, at 322 metres, exceeding Eureka Tower by 25 metres. The 1 Queensbridge Street site will be home to a 6-star hotel with 388 rooms and 708 apartments. Premier Daniel Andrews said the project was of "state significance" because it would create 4000 jobs; 3000 during construction and another 1000 once up and running. "It's not just about height though, the quality of this design outcome, particularly the public realm benefits that will be accessible for all Victorians, really mark this out as a very, very special project," Mr Andrews said. Planning Minister Richard Wynne gave approval to the project – which is claimed to represent $2.1 billion in economic benefit - after 12 months of talks with the developer and Melbourne City Council. "This process has been careful, it has been considered," Mr Andrews said.  As part of the deal Crown and developer Schiavello group will pay $100 million towards a community package that will see a $25 million upgrade of Queensbridge square, and $15 million towards Sandridge rail bridge. The Premier said the old rail bridge could be re-imagined to be similar to the famous High Line in New York City. Construction on the 5060 square metre site is hoped to begin as soon as 2018 and will take up to six years to complete. There will be no gaming at the new site, which will be connected to the casino complex by a footbridge over Queensbridge Street. Crown shares are up a touch at $11.23. Read more. Photo: Fairfax Media Back to top 12:16pm on 9 Feb 2017 The sharemarket has just been jolted out of its midday slumber, possibly due to a de-escalatory move by US President Donald Trump. The ASX jumped 20 points and US futures trimmed losses within minutes of wires reporting that Trump sent a letter to China's President Xi Jinping saying he looked forward to working with him "to develop a constructive relationship" that benefits both countries, the White House said in a statement. The letter also thanked Xi for his congratulatory letter on Trump's inauguration and wished the Chinese people a prosperous Year of the Rooster, the statement said. The letter is the first direct communication from Trump to Xi since he moved into the White House on January 20. Trump still hasn't set up a call with Xi since then despite speaking on the phone with more than a dozen world leaders. Trump is under pressure to take some sort of action against China after criticising the nation repeatedly over trade on the campaign trail. In tweets since his election win, Trump has questioned the One-China policy and criticised China's leaders for failing to do more against North Korea. Just last week, he again accused China of manipulating its currency. 12:01pm on 9 Feb 2017 China is likely to feel less pain than other major economies if US President Donald Trump achieves his goal of pushing the US dollar lower, while Europe, Japan and the emerging markets will pay a far higher price, according to top Goldman Sachs economists. Andrew Tilton, Goldman Sachs' chief Asia-Pacific economist said it was difficult to know whether the Trump administration would be persistent in pushing for a weaker US dollar, particularly since some of its policies - including fiscal stimulus and possible tariffs - were likely to result in the currency strengthening. But, he said in an interview with the AFR, a weaker US dollar would likely prove "very difficult for Japan". "It's very hard to see how the Bank of Japan could hope to get inflation back to the 2 per cent level with a stronger currency, particularly since Japan is struggling with this prolonged low inflation - and, for many years, deflation - and it has already done a very large amount of monetary easing and pushed the yield curve down to essentially zero." In contrast, he said there was some alignment between the Trump administration and Beijing because "China would also like a weak dollar." According to Tilton, "at the moment, growth in China is pretty good and inflation pressure looks like it is shifting a bit to the upside. "So in the very short term, having a slightly stronger currency might not be something the Chinese authorities would mind because it might reduce inflationary pressure at the margin, and also discourage capital outflow, which has been a persistent concern." But, he noted, "having said that, given falling potential growth in China and the likelihood of ongoing growth challenges over the next few years, I don't think China wants to see a sustained appreciation in its currency." Tilton said that one reason Beijing is battling large capital outflows is that Chinese businesses and consumers expect that the Chinese currency will depreciate further, particularly versus the US dollar. "Onshore Chinese residents are used to thinking about their currency in comparison with the US dollar. Here's more at the AFR China wouldn't mind a stronger yuan, Goldman says. Photo: Bloomberg 11:41am on 9 Feb 2017 A Canadian investment and insurance company has agreed to buy New Zealand insurer Tower for $NZ197 million ($186.8 million) in cash. Fairfax Financial Holdings [Eds: No relation to the esteemed publisher of this blog] has offered NZ$1.17 a share for Tower, 48 per cent more than Tower's closing price on Wednesday, the companies said in a statement to the New Zealand stock exchange Thursday. Tower's ASX- and NZ-listed stocks have surged by more than 40 per cent to $1.07 and $NZ1.12, respectively. Tower's board has unanimously approved the offer, and two of the company's major shareholders, who hold 18 per cent of the shares, have agreed to vote in favour of the deal The Canadian firm run by Prem Watsa is known for making acquisitions. It agreed in October to buy commercial and consumer units from AIG in nations including Argentina and Turkey. In December, Watsa struck one of his biggest deals ever,the $US4.9 billion buyout of Allied World Assurance Co. Like value investor Warren Buffett, Watsa uses insurance premiums to invest in other industries. Fairfax controls one ofthe biggest stakes in BlackBerry and profited in the US financial crisis by using derivatives to bet against the creditworthiness of US banks and insurers. Tower has fielded an accepted a takeover offer from a Canadian company. Photo: Supplied 11:10am on 9 Feb 2017 Gold is hanging onto most of its strong overnight gains, but interestingly gold stocks are floundering today The yellow metal's spot price is down 0.2 per cent at around $US1240 an ounce, just below a three-month high of $US1244 it hit overnight, while the All Ords gold index has slipped 0.2 per cent, on track for a second day in the red. It might just be that investors are taking a breather from a rally that has seen gold stocks soar more than 40 per cent since mid-December. Investors say the gold price will remain supported by lingering political uncertainty around the Trump administration as well as looming European elections. "There's underlying demand for gold as a hedge against political uncertainties on both sides of the Atlantic," said Ole Hanson, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. "Retracements have been quite shallow the past couple of weeks, especially the signal that gold wasn't going down when the dollar started going up," he added. 10:46am on 9 Feb 2017 Rio Tinto's surprise move to start a share buyback and reward investors with a bigger-than-expected dividend of $US3.1 billion has laid down a marker to mining rivals benefiting from higher commodity prices. BHP Billiton, Anglo American and Glencore will publish results later this month. Like Rio, which late yesterday reported its first profit increase since 2013, they're expected to see a rise in profits thanks to higher iron ore, coal, zinc and nickel prices. "All three are likely to follow Rio's steps of increasing returns to shareholders in some fashion," said Jeremy Sussman, an analyst at Clarksons Platou Securities. "Once one of the majors starts on this path, we typically see others follow. Glencore actually began this trend in the fourth quarter by reinstating its dividend, though Rio took it to another level today." But if investors liked Rio's cash splash, they're not showing it in today's trade, with the stock down 0.7 per cent at $65.25. The stock initially rallied as much as 3.5 per cent in London overnight, but closed 1.7 per cent lower as traders digested the results. The top producers are emerging from a crippling downturn that forced them to cut costs, sell shares and under-performing assets and in some cases scrap dividends to repair debt-laden balance sheets. The speed of the industry's turnaround that enabled Rio to return surplus cash to investors has surprised market analysts and mining executives alike. Rio's cash splash ups the pressure on other mining giants to follow suit. Photo: Rob Homer Back to top 10:16am on 9 Feb 2017 Sales of new homes in edged higher in December, a solid result given it built upon a sharp rebound the month before. The Housing Industry Association said its survey of large-volume builders showed new home sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent in December from November, when they jumped 6.1 per cent. Sales of houses dipped 1.6 per cent, while apartment sales climbed 6.4 per cent. New home sales hit a two year low in October last year, but recovered well in November and December, the HIA said, adding the late 2016 results were strong for the sales of 'multi-units', while detached house sales remained in "reasonable shape". "The strong finish to 2016 for new home sales admittedly follows a very weak month in October," said HIA chief economist Harley Dale. "Obviously it is better that new home sales bounced back rather than kept falling. "The overall profile for both HIA new home sales and ABS building approvals is consistent with the first stage of the down cycle in new home commencements being a mild one. We expect this down cycle to begin in 2017." 9:44am on 9 Feb 2017 In the next case of twitchy tweet fingers, President Donald Trump blasted department store chain Nordstrom for dropping his daughter Ivanka's clothing line, prompting critics to accuse him of misusing public office to benefit his family's sprawling business empire. After Trump's highly unusual move to use a White House platform to intervene in a commercial matter involving his daughter, Nordstrom reiterated that its action last week was based on declining sales of the Ivanka Trump products. But White House spokesman Sean Spicer characterised the move as a "direct attack" on the president's policies. My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017 Somewhat surprisingly, on a day when the S&P 500 Index was flat, Nordstrom shares enjoyed a fantastic rally, closing 4 per cent higher after initially dipping on the President's tweet. TJX, whose T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains removed Ivanka displays, also posted strong gains. It seems, investors have taken the view that a chiding from Trump will turn shopping into an act of profitable protest. Thank you #TJMax and #Nordstrom for taking a stand and standing with the majority of your shoppers! My 2 new favorite places to shop :)— Cailin O'Connor (@CailinEOC) February 8, 2017 "This is misuse of public office for private gains," said Richard Painter, who served as Republican president George W. Bush's chief ethics lawyer. "And it is abuse of power because the official message is clear - Nordstrom is persona non grata with the administration." The wealthy New York real estate developer who became president on January 20 has declined to sell off his businesses despite demands from critics that he do so to avoid thorny conflicts of interest. Trump on January 11 said he would maintain ownership of his global business empire but hand off control to his two oldest sons during his presidency. Trump's web of international companies remains a bit opaque since he has refused to release his tax returns, which experts have said would provide a clearer view of his business interests. Ethics experts have said Trump's arrangement does little to address potential conflicts because he would still know what assets he owned, such as Trump-branded golf courses and hotels, and his family would continue to profit from them. Nordstrom said it informed Ivanka Trump about its decision in early January. "Over the past year, and particularly in the last half of 2016, sales of the brand have steadily declined to the point where it didn't make good business sense for us to continue with the line for now," the retailer said. Some retailers continue to carry Ivanka Trump products but others have backed away. The move by the retailers comes amid an ongoing campaign called #GrabYourWallet, which encourages shoppers to boycott products with ties to President Trump, his family and his donors. Usage of the hashtag on Twitter rose dramatically on Wednesday. Since winning the presidential election on November 8, Trump has castigated specific companies on Twitter but this was his first tweet involving a business tied to his family since the victory. Donald Trump has blasted Nordstrom for dumping his daughter's products - due to declining sales, the department store chain says.  9:31am on 9 Feb 2017 Shares have shaken off another downbeat overseas lead, helped along by well received trading updates from AMP and AGL. The ASX 200 is 13 points or 0.2 per cent higher at 5665, with gains in the big banks providing the backbone for the morning's rise. NAB is the best of the Big Four, up 0.9 per cent, while Westpac is up 0.6 per cent, ANZ 0.2 per cent and CBA a modest 0.1 per cent. Suncorp is up 1.1 per cent following its profits report, while AMP is up 3.2 per cent and AGL 2.1 per cent after providing their own updates to the market - both of which involved bigger shareholder returns. Miners are dragging on a broadly higher market. Rio is down 0.7 per cent despite what looked like a pretty decent report, and BHP is off 1.3 per cent and South32 1.5 per cent. The exception once again are gold producers, that continue to enjoy the renewed investor appetite for the precious metal. Winners and losers in the ASX 200 this morning. Photo: Bloomberg 9:10am on 9 Feb 2017 SPONSORED POST Markets are poised and ready to jump - but which way? asks IG analyst Gary Burton: Our [Aussie equity] benchmark has traded in a 3.6 per cent range for the past 40 days. These types of consolidations usually end badly for one side of the market, the short sellers forced to close positions if the market breaks higher and the long positions forced out if the market moves lower. Rio reported in London earnings per share of $5.38, with 320 million tonnes of iron ore shipped and 580,000 tonnes of copper produced, which China soaked up into the expanding infrastructure programs. It is interesting to note that Rio has worked to offload the coal assets but retained the iron ore as the keeper, and are willing to expend this area of the business. A share buyback and dividend increase failed to impress the market. Read more. 8:59am on 9 Feb 2017 Analysts believe Rio Tinto is entering a phase of strong returns to shareholders, in a turnaround from the dividend cuts announced across the big end of the mining sector just a year ago. Rio easily beat expectations for its full-year dividend to be about $US1.33 yesterday after the market closed, when it announced a $US1.70 fully franked dividend and a $US500 million share buyback. The strong payout was enabled by a sharp reduction in the miner's debt levels, and when asked whether he believed Rio was entering an era of strong returns, Clive Burstow from Barings Asset Management's London-based Global Resources Fund said; "Yes, I do actually." "They obviously have confidence in the business over the next three years, the CEO said on the call we have confidence over our growth expenditure, I would expect therefore there to be a good period of returns to shareholders on the back of that," he said.  "Obviously the unknown in all of that is what commodity prices will do, but if you accept that commodity prices are in a reasonably well supported phase fundamentally, then yes I think as a shareholder you can expect to see some reasonable returns to your account. Analysts are also fuelling expectations that Rio could pay out even higher dividends, with most saying there was still upside for next year despite more being spent on shareholder returns on Wednesday than had been expected. But not all Rio shareholders agree; Craig Evans from Tribeca Investment Partners's Sydney-based Global Natural Resources fund said he was more focused on growth rather than dividends, but there were upsides from the latter. "We don't necessarily need the dividend, we would love to see them investing in some growth, but we are very aware that a strong dividend adds value to the share price to keep the more yield-hungry investors happy," he said. Rio Tinto easily beat dividend expectations.  Back to top Search pagination Current page Live Article Posts1 Next Live Article Posts2 Share via Email Post on facebook wall Share on Google Plus Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit 1 new post(s) available.

The pullback in General Motors' stock this week following its earnings release may be "overdone," JPMorgan told clients on Wednesday, advising them to use the drop as a buying opportunity. "Essentially, the quarter was neither here nor there, in stark contrast to the share price reaction, and we believe GM remains well positioned to grow EPS in 2017, contrary to consensus; as such, we reiterate our overweight rating and recommend taking advantage of the pullback in GM shares by adding to positions," equity analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a research note. On Tuesday, GM reported earnings and revenue figures that exceeded analysts' expectations, but the stock fell nearly 5 percent on concern North American sales are near a top. "We believe GM EPS has not peaked and continue to forecast stronger results in 2017 vs. 2016," Brinkman said.

The Dow fell 35 points, with Goldman Sachs contributing the most losses. Apple, another Dow component, traded near its all-time high. The index had fallen about 75 points at session lows.

The Nasdaq gained 0.15 percent. Pressuring the financials sector were bank stocks, as the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) and the Regional Banking ETF (KRE) dropped around 1 percent, posting a three-day losing streak. Bank stocks have been some of the best performers since President Donald Trump's election, as market participants bet on corporate tax cuts, deregulation and government spending. "A deviation from that will be perceived as a negative," said Rob Bartenstein, CEO of Kestra Private Wealth Services. "My overarching belief here is that this policy grind — where we shift from expectation to implementation — will bring some volatility into the market." Recently, however, equities have mostly traded in a tight range, as market participants seek out more details regarding Trump's policies. "It's almost like we're caught in a swamp. The market just can't seem to move one way or the other," said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial. "Earnings and economic news have been pretty good, ... but, at the same time, the market is looking at Washington out the corner of its eye." He also noted the S&P was on track to post its 37th straight day without a 1 percent trading range. Investors also focused on oil prices, with crude futures for March delivery rising 0.33 percent to settle at $52.34 a barrel, with the Energy Information Administration reporting a 13.8 million barrels increase in oil inventories. The American Petroleum Institute said Tuesday that inventories rose by 14.2 million barrels the week of Feb. 3, sharply above the expected 2.5 million barrels increase. "The resurgence of U.S shale amid the rising oil could undermine the efforts of OPEC and Non-OPEC members in mitigating the global oversupply consequently leaving oil prices vulnerable," said Lukman Otunuga, research analyst at FXTM, in a note. "There is a threat of the OPEC production cut deal falling apart in the future if U.S shale continues to pump incessantly." WTI had traded about 1 percent lower shortly after the EIA's release before turning positive. "We've had pretty steady oil prices for a while, but we've gotten some volatility recently," said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "But in general, it doesn't become a drag or a benefit on the market as long as it stays in that $50-to-$55 range." The S&P energy sector led decliners Tuesday, capping gains in the overall stock market. The Dow and Nasdaq hit record highs Tuesday. "At the same time, you're seeing capital being allocated into other areas of the market, such as metals," said Adam Sarhan, CEO of 50 Park Investments. Metals futures were all up more than 1 percent for the week. Gold futures for April delivery gained $3.40 to settle at $1,239.50 per ounce. "I look at buying gold as buying stocks back in March of 2009," said Sarhan, noting valuations for the precious metal are stretched to the downside. There are no major economic data due Wednesday, but investors kept a close eye on earnings. Allergan, GlaxoSmithKline, Time Warner and Alaska Air are among the major companies that reported earnings before the bell. Whole Foods, CenturyLink, Fiserv and Prudential Financial are all due to report after the market close. Dow component Walt Disney posted mixed quarterly results Tuesday after the close, as earnings per share topped analyst expectations while sales fell short. As of Wednesday morning, 64 percent of S&P 500 companies had posted quarterly results, with 69 percent of those firms topping earnings estimates, while 52 percent have beaten sales expectations, according to data from The Earnings Scout. The U.S. dollar slipped against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.068 and the yen around 112.20. U.S. Treasurys held higher after a $23 billion auction of 10-year notes, which saw weak demand, with the benchmark 10-year note yield falling to 2.364 percent and the short-term two-year note holding near 1.161 percent. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 11.3.

Gold, another safe-haven investment, also gained. Wall Street fluctuated even as the latest round of corporate earnings has generally exceeded expectations. Both the Dow and the Nasdaq touched record highs the previous day. In 1.22pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 percent, while, in 1.06pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index inched 0.01 percent lower. The Nasdaq Composite Index eked out a 0.03 percent gain. It’s the first quarter in eight that S&P 500 Index profits will rise fast enough to pronounce an end to the earnings recession, according to Bloomberg. However, investors have been cautious. “Companies that have beaten expectations haven’t been rewarded as much as usual, at least so far this earnings season,” Dan Suzuki, senior equity strategist at Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch unit, told Bloomberg. In the Dow, declines in shares of JPMorgan Chase and those of Caterpillar, recently down 1.4 percent and 0.8 percent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Nike and those of Verizon, which recently traded 1.4 percent and 0.9 percent higher respectively. In the latest deal news, shares of Tesaro jumed, trading 13.4 percent higher as of 1.25pm in New York. The US biopharmaceutical company is discussing its options with investment banks after receiving acquisition interest from several drugmakers, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Tesaro is not actively exploring a sale, the people said this week, noting that there is a significant gap over the company's valuation between Tesaro and potential acquirers, according to Reuters. However, Tesaro is speaking to investment banks, including Citigroup about its strategy and how to best respond to such overtures, the people added. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.3 percent gain from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index edged 0.04 percent higher, while France’s CAC 40 Index added 0.3 percent. Germany’s DAX Index slipped 0.05 percent. Shares of Syngenta rose after the Swiss seeds and pesticide maker that is being bought by China National Chemical for US$43 billion said both companies are confident the deal will close. “ChemChina and Syngenta have made significant progress towards achieving the necessary regulatory approvals and closing the transaction,” Syngenta said in a statement discussing its latest earnings. Both companies “are confident of its closure,” Syngenta said, adding its expects it to close in the second quarter. Syngenta shares closed 1.1 percent higher in Zurich.

Photo / Bloomberg US Treasuries advanced, while Wall Street was mixed, as investors weighed the impact of political uncertainty on both sides of the Atlantic on corporate profits. Gold, another safe-haven investment, also gained. Wall Street fluctuated even as the latest round of corporate earnings has generally exceeded expectations. Both the Dow and the Nasdaq touched record highs the previous day. In 1.22pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 per cent, while, in 1.06pm trading, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index inched 0.01 per cent lower. The Nasdaq Composite Index eked out a 0.03 per cent gain. It's the first quarter in eight that S&P 500 Index profits will rise fast enough to pronounce an end to the earnings recession, according to Bloomberg. However, investors have been cautious. "Companies that have beaten expectations haven't been rewarded as much as usual, at least so far this earnings season," Dan Suzuki, senior equity strategist at Bank of America's Merrill Lynch unit, told Bloomberg. In the Dow, declines in shares of JPMorgan Chase and those of Caterpillar, recently down 1.4 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively, outweighed gains in shares of Nike and those of Verizon, which recently traded 1.4 per cent and 0.9 per cent higher respectively. In the latest deal news, shares of Tesaro jumed, trading 13.4 per cent higher as of 1.25pm in New York. The US biopharmaceutical company is discussing its options with investment banks after receiving acquisition interest from several drugmakers, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Tesaro is not actively exploring a sale, the people said this week, noting that there is a significant gap over the company's valuation between Tesaro and potential acquirers, according to Reuters. However, Tesaro is speaking to investment banks, including Citigroup about its strategy and how to best respond to such overtures, the people added. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.3 per cent gain from the previous close. The UK's FTSE 100 Index edged 0.04 per cent higher, while France's CAC 40 Index added 0.3 percent.

Both companies "are confident of its closure," Syngenta said, adding its expects it to close in the second quarter.

At the same time, a more serious threat has been gathering in intensity. Iran and the Trump administration are on a collision course over Iran’s testing of ballistic missiles, which Iran maintains are a valid part of its domestic defence planning. The US, via Trump’s national security adviser Michael Flynn, has put Iran “on notice” and imposed fresh sanctions. Undaunted, Iran has continued to test more missiles.

While you were sleeping: UPDATED Wall St mixed as caution follows records Margreet Dietz Thursday February 9, 2017 Share Play NBR radio on US Treasurys advanced, while Wall Street was mixed, as investors weighed the impact of political uncertainty on both sides of the Atlantic on corporate profits. Gold, another safe-haven investment, also gained with futures for April delivery closing up 0.3% at $US1239.50 an ounce. Gold is up nearly 8% since the start of the year.. Wall Street fluctuated even as the latest round of corporate earnings has generally exceeded expectations. Both the Dow and the Nasdaq touched record highs the previous day. At the close of trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 35.95 points, or 0.2%, at 20,054.34, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose 0.07% to 2294.67.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year US Treasury note fell to 2.349% from 2.389% on Tuesday.  In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with a 0.3% gain from the previous close.

The financial index dropped 1 percent and was on track to mark its biggest drop in three weeks due to declines in JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. Analysts say market is reducing expectations for the number of U.S. interest rate hikes this year as well as for fiscal stimulus policies and tax cuts from President Donald Trump's administration. Goldman Sachs fell 1.1 percent and was the biggest drag on the Dow. The dollar slipped 0.14 percent, while gold rose to a near three-month high amid political uncertainty in Europe ahead of elections. At 12:24 p.m. ET (1724 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 38.02 points, or 0.19 percent, at 20,052.27 and the S&P 500 was down 0.17 points, or flat, at 2,292.91. The Nasdaq Composite was up 1.07 points, or 0.02 percent, at 5,675.28. Six of the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by gains in technology and consumer discretionary stocks. Cognizant rose 4 percent to $55.93 after the IT services provider named three directors to its board and announced a $3.4 billion share buyback program, bowing to pressure from activist shareholder Elliott Management. Healthcare was off 0.29 percent, dragged down by Gilead. The drugmaker's stock, which also weighed on the S&P and the Nasdaq, slid 9.7 percent after the company projected disappointing sales for its hepatitis C drugs this year. U.S. carrier Alaska Air rose 2 percent to $96.06 after the company reported a 10.7 percent jump in quarterly revenue. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1,490 to 1,370. On the Nasdaq, 1,746 issues fell and 997 advanced. The S&P 500 index showed 16 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 67 new highs and 40 new lows.

Hit Back at DAPL Banks to Stand with Standing Rock DAPL Defunding Hits $57 Million from Individuals As Tribes Begin to Disinvest from DAPL Banks Mark Fogarty • February 8, 2017 People controlling more than 1,800 deposit accounts have reported removing more than $57 million from DAPL banks involved in the financing of the Dakota Access Pipeline. In addition, at least four tribes have been reported as disinvesting from the financial institutions involved in funding DAPL, though the amounts involved have not been divulged. Of the 1,806 accounts self-reported closed as of February 6, per a tally maintained by website defunddapl.org, nearly a third, 564, were with Wells Fargo Bank. JPMorgan Chase was second, at 431, followed by Bank of America, 372, and Citigroup, 132. Intergenerational Trauma: Understanding Natives’ Inherited Pain Download our free report, Intergenerational Trauma: Understanding Natives’ Inherited Pain, to understand this fascinating concept. Download Today! Smaller numbers were reported for TD Bank, ING Bank, HSBC, PNC, and US Bank. Amounts defunded include $30 million at Wells, $8 million at Bank of America, $6 million at Chase, $3.3 million at TD Bank, $2.8 million at US Bank, and $2.5 million at Citigroup. A person identifying himself only as Caleb said defunddapl.org was an effort by, “allies at Standing Rock [who want] to build widespread awareness in young people about the role banks play in financing the environmental and social degradation of our planet and that we all have the power to stop them. We are building coalitions in cities to work on civic level engagement and building grassroots campaigns to push big companies to like REI to defund banks which profit off DAPL and other extractive investments.” In addition to the website, information on the disinvestments can be found on a digital billboard in New York City’s Times Square. The billboard, said to be on display through the end of March, features the “Water Is Life” slogan as well as “We Are Water Protectors,” “Stand with Standing Rock,” and “Divest from the Dakota Pipeline.” Sponsors are said to include Sacred Stone Camp, Honor the Earth, Indigenous Environmental Network, and International Indigenous Youth Council. A video of the billboard can be found here. The tribes reported to be agreeing to disinvest from the DAPL banks involved in funding the pipeline include the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe of North/South Dakota, adjacent to the pipeline construction, the Nez Perce tribe of Idaho, the Mille Lacs Ojibwe of Minnesota, and the Muckleshoot Tribe of Washington state. In addition to being the brunt of the anger of the largest number of individual de-funders, Wells Fargo was in the crosshairs of an effort to get the city of Seattle to disinvest as much as $3 billion worth of business with the big bank. An 8-0 committee vote last week advanced a bill calling for the city to not renew its depository contract with Wells when it runs out at the end of 2018, and to not invest in any Wells securities. On Tuesday, February 7, the Seattle City Council completed the divestiture process. “Wells has not in any way matched the values of this city,” one committee member said. The full council meeting was scheduled for February 6 but had been postponed, apparently due to a snowstorm. Wells Fargo has released a statement saying it “understands the social and environmental concerns associated with projects such as the Dakota Access Pipeline” and that it is “one of 17 financial institutions involved in financing the DAPL. The loans we have provided represent less than 5 percent of the total.” The bank touted its record as a leader in the financing of renewable energy and clean technology. “We have supported the evolution of energy markets toward cleaner forms of generation by investing more than $52 billion in environmentally sustainable businesses since 2012. In 2015, projects owned in whole or in part by Wells Fargo produced 10 percent of all solar photovoltaic and wind energy generated in the U.S.” Intergenerational Trauma: Understanding Natives’ Inherited Pain Download our free report, Intergenerational Trauma: Understanding Natives’ Inherited Pain, to understand this fascinating concept.

It also lauded its role in providing financing to tribes and Native people, in all “more than 200 tribal and Native entities in 27 states, including tribal community development projects.” Home Mortgage Disclosure Act figures for 2015 from the ComplianceTech (McLean, Virginia) LendingPatterns database show that Wells was the second biggest mortgage lender to Natives in Seattle that year. Its volume was $2.1 million, through seven loans, about 11 percent of the total. (In all, 30 lenders loaned $18 million to American Indians in the city of Seattle.) It also was second in mortgage lending to Natives nationwide, at $415.3 million, or about seven percent of the total. Perhaps coincidentally, Wells Fargo has just announced a series of donations totaling $500,000 to nonprofit groups in the Seattle area. Its NeighborhoodLIFT program will give $100,000 apiece to Capitol Hill Housing, Downtown Emergency Service Center, El Centro de la Raza, Homestead Community Land Trust, and Mercy Housing Northwest. The money comes from a $5 million commitment by Wells Fargo to boost local homeownership and revitalize neighborhoods. “NeighborhoodLIFT will create hundreds of homeowners in Seattle-King County through homebuyer education plus matching down payment assistance grants up to $7,500. More than $3.3 million in down payment assistance grants are still available.” While the “17 lenders” number Wells quotes appears frequently in news accounts, a filing by pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners indicates the number of lenders is higher than that, or at least was as of 2015. A Securities and Exchange Commission filing by Energy Transfer Partners LP of Delaware in 2015 listed 26 DAPL banks that had committed a total of $3.75 billion towards a revolving credit facility for the DAPL project. Wells was one of the three DAPL banks with the biggest commitment of $185 million, or 4.93 percent. The others pledging that same amount were Bank of America and Royal Bank of Scotland. Nine other DAPL banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, pledged $175 million in financing. Wells Fargo was listed as the Administrative Agent on the Feb. 10, 2015 filing, which memorialized an increase of $1.25 billion from the original financing of $2.5 billion. (See related story for full list of lenders and amounts.) Eight new lenders joined the original consortium for the 2015 filing, including BNP Paribas Bank, which committed $159 million. News reports say DNB Bank of Norway is “reconsidering” its financing for the project.

Italian, French and Greek government bond yield spreads over the German bund have reached new highs amid market nervousness that Europe could be back in a state of crisis. "Somehow the market is there already," Beat Wittmann, partner at Porta Advisors told CNBC on Wednesday. "We will have elections in the Netherlands, in France, in Germany, in one, two, three, four months and that's an eternity in politics, as we have seen in the last 12 months. So yes, in Europe, things will get rougher and more nervous but a lot of that is in the market already," Wittman added. The political calendar is busy, with core member states electing new leaders, but it could become busier with the possibility of snap elections in Italy and Greece. Snap Italian elections The yield on the Italian 10-year government bond rose to 201.8 basis points over Germany on Wednesday morning, the highest since February 2014. According to Alex Dryden, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, this was due to political risks. He told CNBC over the phone that investors see the possibility of snap elections being called in the near future. "We do have some concerns if they call elections," Dryden added. Italy is under a caretaker government after former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi resigned late last year. However, President Sergio Mattarella has refused to call elections before political parties agreed on changes to the electoral law. A court ruling at the end of January upheld some changes to the constitution, supporting views that elections before the summer were possible. Investors are worried that that the Italian election would further destabilize the euro zone -- especially if the populist 5-star movement, which has promised a referendum on the country's membership of the euro, makes a strong showing in the polls. "The most immediate reason why Italian bonds fell this morning is their close connection to renewed tensions over the Greek bailout terms with new disagreements between the Eurogroup of sovereign creditors and the IMF," Jan Randolph, director of sovereign risk at IHS Markit told CNBC via email. show chapters Italy reform prospects are weaker with new govt: Eurasia    Wednesday, 25 Jan 2017 | 1:17 AM ET | 01:31 Greek drama "This "Italian connection" pattern was established in past bailout tensions amongst Greece's public-based creditors; and highly indebted euro zone governments like Italy are seem as vulnerable. If Italy were to ever to get into debt trouble again – like in the last few weeks of the Berlusconi government – then a bailout would be virtually impossible if the euro zone creditors and IMF cannot agree on debt sustainability issues. This scenario would be potentially explosive for the Eurozone," he added. Greece has also returned to the headlines this week as it is once again at odds with its creditors over the need to impose further austerity measures. If such impasse isn't overcome over the next few weeks, then Greece might be in trouble to repay creditors in the summer and become another headache for European leaders at a time when their main focus in on winning elections. French farce? show chapters Why this week is crucial for France’s right-wing politicians    Monday, 6 Feb 2017 | 1:31 AM ET | 03:53 This is the case in France, where the outcome of the presidential election gets more uncertain by the day. The 10-year government bond yields rose 78.8 points against the German bund on Wednesday morning, the highest since November 2012. "A Le Pen win in France with a clear program to put the EU, the euro, NATO, etc up for referendum of course is going to drive these spread yields as we get closer to the election," Wittman said. However, Dryden from JPMorgan belives that political risk is "overdone" in France, given that the election includes two rounds, which decreases the chances of a final win for the far-right of Le Pen. Nonetheless, as the political calendar advances and the European political landscape becomes clearer, there should be some buying opportunities around. "I am a firm believer that by the end of the year there's full integrity of the euro zone, I'd treat that as a buying opportunity (Italian bonds)," Wittman told CNBC.

Updated by Matthew Yglesias@mattyglesias Feb 8, 2017, 8:00am EST tweet share Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Donald Trump campaigned as a champion of the “forgotten man,” promising to make America great again with a focus on lunch-pail populism and steel mills. He accused both Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton of being “totally controlled” by Wall Street. And he cleverly leveraged Bernie Sanders’s primary campaign accusations that Clinton was too close to banks into weapons he himself could wield. On the campaign trail, Trump alleged that “Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of US sovereignty,” and that the United States has merely “an illusion of democracy” but is “in fact controlled by a small handful of special global interests rigging the system.” In his campaign’s closing ad on the subject, Trump drove the point home by juxtaposing Clinton with pictures of various prominent Jewish financiers. Then, having won the election, he set about installing an incredible array of financial industry insiders at high levels of policymaking. They’re setting a policy trajectory that’s a stunning reversal of both Trump’s campaign rhetoric and the broad track of American policymaking over the years. After the crash of 2008, there was broad consensus that something had to be changed. The Obama administration, joined by a handful of Republicans, put together the Dodd-Frank act to overhaul financial regulation in the United States. Many critics on the left (and a few on the right) argued that the law didn’t go far enough and should have implemented hard caps on the size of financial institutions. Most Republicans rejected the law but embraced alternative theories of how regulation ought to be changed — in terms of stricter limits on bank borrowing, an end of government involvement in mortgage securitization, or some kind of effort to guarantee that there would be no government bailouts in the future. They are all different theories aimed at a similar goal — to restrain banks from engaging in excessive risk-taking that endangered the economy. Trump is, however, simply throwing all of that out the window in favor of the idea that what America needs is more rules written with input of the banks themselves and aimed at the goal of encouraging a return of risky lending. That’s likely to be great for bankers, bank shareholders, and maybe the odd wealthy real estate developer while doing nothing for Middle America or the middle class. Trump’s Wall Street team Trump’s set of policy advisers so far is drawn overwhelmingly from Wall Street. Even without formal new acts of Congress, an administration team that wants to do Wall Street’s bidding can easily get its way by simply encouraging regulatory agencies to turn a blind eye to enforcement. Trump’s National Economic Council chief, Gary Cohn, comes to the White House directly from service as chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs. For leaving the investment bank to join the government, he received a massive $285 million bonus from Goldman. Trump’s Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, is a hedge fund manager who used to work at Goldman Sachs. The populist wing of Trump’s administration is represented by senior counselor Steve Bannon, who used to work at Goldman Sachs, and the moderate wing of his administration is represented by Trump’s daughter Ivanka, who tapped Goldman Sachs’s Dina Powell to serve as her policy adviser. Then, on Friday, outside of a meeting with a new council of CEOs that includes JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon, Trump proclaimed that “there’s nobody better to tell me about Dodd-Frank” — the big financial regulation overhaul passed in the wake of the crisis — “than Jamie.” He proceeded to issue a vaguely worded executive order instructing his Treasury secretary to conduct a 120-day review of Dodd-Frank’s provisions and come up with proposals for things to scrap. It adds up to an administration that’s overwhelmingly likely to do the complete opposite of draining the swamp. Barack Obama’s financial regulatory apparatus almost certainly won’t be entirely thrown out the window, and it’s unlikely to be replaced by a sweeping new ideological vision. Instead, it will simply be implemented and overseen by and for the interests of the kind of wealthy business executives whose opinions Trump personally values. As Trump himself explained while unveiling the order, “we expect to be cutting a lot out of Dodd-Frank.” To explain why, he referenced his rich friends. “I have so many people, friends of mine, with nice businesses, they can’t borrow money because the banks just won’t let them borrow, because of the rules and regulations and Dodd-Frank.” As Larry Summers, former Treasury secretary and National Economic Council chair, put it, this is more like grousing from “an East Hampton cocktail party than a serious policy discussion.” But of course, Trump has a lot more experience with society parties than with serious policy discussions. Bank deregulation without principles Throughout the Obama era, conservative opposition to the post-crisis regulatory landscape took two broad flavors. The basic premise of both the Federal Reserve and the White House was that, faced with financial crisis, the government had no choice but to intervene to rescue the system. Given that reality, a responsible government has an obligation to try to regulate the system in order to avoid the need for bailouts. One strand of opposition to Obama’s regulatory efforts, personified by House Financial Services Committee Chair Jeb Hensarling, basically rejects this premise. This strand’s view is that a drastically simplified regulatory framework — perhaps including a crude limit on bank borrowing and not much else — would be fine, and what the federal government really needs to do is tie itself more strongly to the mast of free markets and no bailouts. The other strand of opposition, reflected in industry, is simply that the industry would prefer not to be regulated. Bankers feel that if American banks weren’t regulated so much, they could do business more aggressively, which would be good. Trump’s choice of the COO of one giant bank as his top economic policy adviser and citation of the CEO of another giant bank as a leading authority on smart regulatory policy is a good sign of where he stands on this. His anecdote explaining that some of his rich friends are being told regulation is the reason they can’t get loans is, in its way, even more telling. Statistically speaking, there is more bank lending today than ever before. But it’s certainly true that if regulators allowed banks to engage in riskier behavior, some new risky bets could get made. The downside, of course, would be a much more fragile economy. Trump is laying the groundwork for the next financial crisis It’s noteworthy that Cohn, whom Trump is relying on for advice, was Goldman’s COO, a practical businessman whose job was to work to make the bank more profitable. Goldman Sachs also has a division dedicated to conducting big-picture analysis of the global economy. That research division is headed by Jan Hatzius, whose views of Trump’s economic policies are worth paying attention to. Goldman’s analysis of the Trump economy is a balance between the idea that Trump will deliver a short-term boost to growth thanks to fiscal stimulus and the concern that Trump will hurt the economy with chaos and trade wars. That Trump’s team of former Goldmanites will unleash prosperity by deregulating Goldman Sachs doesn’t strike Goldman’s economic analysts as plausible. In part, that’s simply because with the unemployment rate already low and the Federal Reserve already in the process of raising interest rates, there’s no room for this to work. Indeed, Cohn himself, speaking to the Wall Street Journal last week about his deregulatory agenda, said the United States has “the best, most highly capitalized banks in the world, and we should use that to our competitive advantage.” Weaker regulation, in other words, will let US-based banks gain more global market share relative to European or Japanese competitors. That’s great if you happen to be a bank shareholder or a bank executive, or have a yearly bonus pegged to bank share prices. But it has nothing to do with creating job opportunities for the long-term unemployed or increasing middle-class wages. There’s no great mystery as to how regulatory policy shaped primarily by the business interests of major banks ends — big profits, big bonuses, and eventually a big crash and a big bailout. But the genius of bank regulation as a policy area is that no matter how badly you screw it up, the odds are that on any given day, there won’t be a financial crisis anyway. A poorly supervised financial system can pile on egregious hidden risks for fun and profit and suffer no obvious bad consequences for years. If it happens to blow up in an election year, of course, you’re screwed. But while dramatic moves on immigration, health care, and budget policy are sure to provoke immediate blowback, on bank regulation, it’s entirely plausible that Trump will sow the seeds of destruction and nobody will notice until reelection is in the rearview mirror.

Banking sources told the Press Association that despite being invited, not a single JP Morgan representative attended the event, which was aimed at luring London-based financial firms to the French capital. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments An invitation to attend a separate meeting with a French delegation of business leaders and politicians on the sidelines of Monday's event was also rejected, with organisers being told that JP Morgan representatives were not in London that day. It meant the US banking giant was missing in action at Monday's summit, which saw more than 60 representatives from UK-based banks, fund managers and insurance firms descend on the London's Shard skyscraper to hear about the benefits of choosing Paris as their post-Brexit destination. News of JP Morgan's absence represents a setback to French hopes of grabbing a slice of Britain's financial services sector pie. The Wall Street lender did, however, send staff from its German office to an invite-only event held by state regulators in Frankfurt at the end of January. Germany's financial watchdog Bafin hosted around 50 representatives from more than 20 banks, including JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, for a workshop that set out guidelines for setting up shop in Frankfurt following Brexit. JP Morgan chie f executive Jamie Dimon has said around 4,000 of its 16,000 UK staff in London could be shifted out of Britain to protect its European business after Brexit, though a potential location has yet to be revealed. Mr Dimon was among a number of Wall Street bosses that met with Prime Minister Theresa May on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last month, shortly after the Government outlined plans to scrap access to the EU's single market. Experts have speculated that rival financial centres such as Dublin, Frankfurt and Paris could end up siphoning off some of the City's business as they court financial services firms ahead of Brexit. HSBC has already confirmed that it is on course to move 1,000 jobs from its London office to France, where it already has a full service universal bank after buying up Credit Commercial de France in 2002. A hard Brexit would effectively remove passporting rights that allow UK-based financial services to trade across the bloc without needing to apply for licenses in each member state. It has raised concerns among City firms who rely on EU business, including insurance market Lloyd's of London, which is searching for a European hub to host a portion of its business in light of Brexit. Sources close to Lloyd's told the Press Association that Luxembourg has emerged as the frontrunner on a short list of five sites - including Malta, Dublin, Frankfurt and Paris - for a potential EU subsidiary. JP Morgan declined to comment.

(Photo by Reuters) Saudi Arabian Oil Co. (Aramco) has chosen the New York-based boutique investment bank Moelis & Co to advise on its initial public offering, reports say. The sale of the world’s biggest oil company is the latest of several moves by the Saudi government to generate revenues in the face of a gaping budget deficit. Aramco had invited banks in January to pitch for an advisory position on what is expected to be the world's biggest initial public offering.   JPMorgan, which has been Aramco’s commercial banker for years, and Michael Klein, a former star Citigroup banker, had been advising Saudi authorities on the IPO. However, the kingdom’s decision to pick a small banker has surprised many observers. International business outlets such as Bloomberg and the Financial Times said the choice represents a coup for Moelis founded no sooner than 2007. The IPO, which is predicted to raise about $100 billion, is set to yield millions of dollars in fees and push Moelis up in global investment bank rankings. Last year, Moelis hired Shlomo Yanai, a retired Israeli military officer, to join the firm as a senior adviser. Yanai had earlier been offered the directorship of the Israeli spy agency Mossad by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but he turned it down.  (L to R) Late Israeli president Shimon Peres, Shlomo Yanai and former Teva CEO Eli Hurvitz tour a Teva Pharmaceutical distribution center on March 1, 2011 in Shoham, Israel. (Photo by Getty Images) The oil giant’s initial public offering, holding $2 trillion in assets, is expected to take place in 2018 with an initial sale of a five-percent share. According to Bloomberg, Aramco expects Moelis to help it select underwriters for the sale, make decisions on potential listing venues and ensure the IPO goes smoothly. Saudi Arabia is currently dealing with a budget deficit of nearly $100 billion caused by a sharp slump in oil prices as well as Riyadh’s rising military expenditure. The kingdom emerged as the world’s third largest military spender in 2015 when it began its military campaign against Yemen. Read more:  Saudi Arabia going broke under huge costs  The Saudis have also been forced to introduce a series of austerity measures that include canceling of some bonuses offered to state employees and increasing of entry visa fees for residents and foreigners. The ruling Saudi family will transfer the revenue from the sale of Aramco to the country’s public investment fund (PIF), which will then be tapped to purchase strategic financial and industrial assets abroad.

Central banks and watchdogs around the world have spent the past eight years drawing up regulation aimed at preventing a repeat of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, but there are fears that project could unravel after Trump said he wants the US to row back on capital rules. Trump’s order for a regulatory review to overcome what he sees as obstacles to lending came as banking watchdogs were trying to complete the final piece of global capital requirements, known as Basel III. Given that the United States wants to shrink the banking rulebook, there are doubts over whether the Basel rules can make it over the finishing line next month if they don’t have backing from the United States. Without support from the world’s biggest capital market, other countries would be less willing to commit too. The core aim of the outstanding part of Basel III that regulators are working on — dubbed Basel IV by critical banks who worry about more stringent capital requirements — is to impose more consistency into how banks calculate the amount of capital they hold against risky assets like loans. JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon said in the aftermath of the financial crisis that European rivals had been “a lot more aggressive” than American banks in calculating capital, meaning they were holding less. European policymakers have rejected that criticism, but their region’s banks have been lobbying against the remaining Basel rules, saying they would force them to increase significantly the amount of capital they need to hold. If the United States fails to approve the completion of Basel III, the perceived problem that European banks get away with holding less capital than US lenders may not be properly tackled, a source involved in the negotiations said. “It’s in the interests of American banks to get this done,” the source said. Others are less optimistic that a deal can now be done after Trump’s intervention. “It’s going to delay completing Basel III, and perhaps lead to it not being concluded,” an adviser to banks said on condition of anonymity. “I do fear that Basel IV is doomed,” a banking industry official added. There are headwinds from elsewhere, too. Patrick McHenry, Republican vice chairman of the House financial services committee, fired a warning shot at Federal Reserve Governor Janet Yellen about the Basel talks in a letter dated Jan. 31, ahead of Trump’s executive order. The Fed must “cease” all attempts to negotiate binding standards “burdening American business” until the Trump Administration has had the opportunity to nominate officials that prioritise “America’s best interests”, McHenry said. While lawmakers often call on regulators to ease pressure on firms, regulators said Trump’s intervention in banking rules gives more clout to McHenry’s warning. The Basel Committee declined to comment. Global cooperation Trump’s decision to review existing, post-crisis banking rules has rung alarm bells among regulators outside the country. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, which regulates the euro zone’s main lenders, said on Monday that easing banking rules could threaten financial stability. Draghi was chairman of the Group of 20 Economies’ (G20) regulatory task force, the Financial Stability Board, which during the financial crisis was instrumental in building up a global approach to reinforcing banking standards. A former regulator said the United States would be scoring an own goal by withdrawing from multilateral bodies like Basel as it would no longer be shaping rules that impinge on US banking competitiveness globally. “It’s early days, but what we have seen in language and rhetoric from Washington is worrying,” said David Wright, a former top EU official who was part of crisis-era efforts to create the global regulatory consensus. “If you break international consensus, you are effectively opening up a regulatory race and heaven knows where it will end,” said Wright, now at Flint Global, which advises companies on regulatory matters. Wright was referring to what was seen in the run-up to the financial crisis, when countries like Britain resorted to a “light touch” approach to banks to make London a more attractive financial centre. Valdis Dombrovskis, the EU’s financial services chief, said last week that international regulatory cooperation had been vital in tackling the financial crisis and must continue. Much will hinge on how much regulatory change Trump can actually push through. Former Democratic Congressman Barney Frank, who jointly sponsored the Dodd Frank Act that Trump wants to review, told the BBC last week he does not expect Congress to approve the wholesale rolling back of rules, but the Trump administration could pressure US regulators to ease up on applying existing requirements. Anil Kashyap, a Bank of England policymaker, said last month that Trump’s nomination for the powerful role of Fed Vice Chair in charge of banking supervision would shape the US approach to international rule-making. It will have a “huge impact”, a regulatory source added. The fear among global regulators is that multilateral bodies like the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board could be abandoned by the United States under Trump. Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri, chairman of Spain’s Bankia, told Spanish television on Tuesday he would be concerned if Trump was questioning the usefulness of international banking rules. “It would worry me very much because I think it’s very important, very relevant that there have been advances in the homogenisation of regulation amongst developed countries,” he said. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Amazon warns that trade protectionism could hurt business China regulator still plans oil futures, weighs easing equity curbs Bursa Malaysia to trade higher next week Dollar rises on hopes for Trump tax reform Uber suffers for Trump ties that leave Tesla’s Musk unsullied (VIDEO) If Trump hits China, regional demand would ease blow in Asia Bursa Malaysia opens easier Sri Lanka eyes China free trade deal this year, PM to visit in May Another day, another mall: How KL Gateway Mall hopes to succeed in a crowded market Ringgit opens slightly lower against US dollar Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Related Articles Uber suffers for Trump ties that leave Tesla’s Musk unsullied (VIDEO) Dollar rises on hopes for Trump tax reform China gets an early win off Trump, but many battles remain Hundreds of immigrants arrested in ‘routine’ US enforcement surge Amazon warns that trade protectionism could hurt business Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

 Brussels think tank: 'Hard Brexit' could kill 30,000 London jobs and £1.5 trillion of assets Oscar Williams-Grut Feb. 8, 2017, 3:29 AM 853 facebook linkedin twitter email print A view of HSBC and Barclays' headquarters in Canary Wharf, London. Oscar Williams-Grut/Business Insider LONDON — Britain's financial and professional services industries could lose up to 30,000 jobs and at least €8 billion (£6.8 billion) in revenue, according to a new report from a Brussels think tank. Bruegel, a European economic think tank, estimates in a research paper released on Wednesday that Britain's looming "hard Brexit" will cut London's share of European wholesale finance markets from 90% to 60%. This is a result of the likely loss of passporting rights, meaning banks and financial institutions will not be able to sell products and services in EU states from London. As a result of this change, Bruegel estimates that as many as 10,000 wholesale finance jobs could move from London to EU countries. Bruegel's report adds that this banking exodus could lead to a domino effect for other industries, saying: "We estimate that a further 18,000 to 20,000 positions related to professional services (eg consultancy, legal and accounting) might be on the move." JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and UBS have already publically said they will be forced to move jobs as a result of Brexit and Goldman Sachs is said to be considering moving as many as 3,000 jobs of its own out of the UK. Bruegel, which has close ties to the European Commission, predicts that Britain could lose €7.96 billion of annual revenue alone from the top 5 US banks relocating jobs out of London and says €1.8 trillion worth of assets could be moved to the continent, equivalent to 17% of all UK banking assets.Bruegel These estimates "are for the purposes of illustration and debate, and not intended as forecasts," Bruegel cautions. But they are also not pie in the sky numbers — they are derived from "discussions with market participants throughout Europe," the paper says. Bruegel's estimate of 30,000 job losses — 10,000 in wholesale banking and 20,000 in professional services — is in fact on the conservative end. Consultancy EY estimated last year that as many as 83,000 jobs could disappear as a result of Brexit. Simon Gleeson, a partner with Clifford Chance specialising in financial regulation, told the Financial Times on Wednesday: "In very broad terms, about 20% of the City of London’s volumes come from the EU. So in a hard Brexit scenario, the City loses 20% of its volumes overnight." €12 billion higher borrowing costs for the EU While the Bruegel report may appear grim reading for Brits with Brexit negotiations looming, there is some hope. The think tank says that "Brexit involves risks for market integrity and stability, because the EU including the UK has been crucially dependent on the Bank of England and the UK Financial Conduct Authority for oversight of its wholesale markets," and adds that "losing even partial access to the efficient London financial centre could entail a loss of efficiency for the EU27 economy." Bruegel estimates that a fragmenting of financial services across the EU27 post-Brexit could "amounts to an extra annual cost of €6 billion to €12 billion for households and corporates" when it comes to borrowing in the EU. This is because the efficiency of having settlement and clearing operations in one place would be lost. This estimate chimes with a leaked report last week from the EU that warned Europe could suffer unless it gets a "workable" deal with the City as part of Brexit negotiations. This theoretically strengthens Britain's negotiating position on Brexit and City Minister Simon Kirby told Business Insider last week: "I think we’re in a strong position and I’m confident that the future has many opportunities." However, Bruegel's policy paper says that Brexit is "an opportunity for the remaining EU27 to accelerate the development of its financial markets" and recommends that Europe harmonises its financial legislation and improves regulatory oversight in preparation for Brexit. If this happens, it could negate Britain's advantage in negotiations. NOW WATCH: PayPal's CEO reveals the 2 key trends that are driving the fintech revolution Loading video...

News Business Business News Rio Tinto announces $500m share buyback as profits hit $5.1bn Industry is rebounding from a downturn that forced some of the top producers to sell assets, cut costs and rein in spending Jesse Riseborough, Perry Williams Wednesday 8 February 2017 08:57 GMT Click to follow The Independent Online Higher iron ore prices boosted underlying profit 12 percent to $5.1 billion in 2016, London-based Rio said on Wednesday Reuters Rio Tinto Group will pay a much higher dividend than expected and buy back $500 million of shares after the world’s second-biggest mining company reported the first gain in annual profit since 2013. Higher iron ore prices boosted underlying profit 12 percent to $5.1 billion in 2016, London-based Rio said on Wednesday. That beat the $4.75 billion average estimate of analysts compiled by Bloomberg. The dividend fell 21 percent to 170 cents a share, reflecting a new policy aligning the payout to earnings. Still, that exceeded the average estimate of 136 cents in the Bloomberg survey and the company’s minimum payout of 110 cents. Rio will purchase U.K.-listed shares throughout this year. Read more Market Report: Rio Tinto's mining sector dominance derailed “What a difference a year makes,” Peter O’Connor, an analyst at Shaw & Partners Ltd. in Sydney, said in a note. “It’s been a long grind back from the global financial abyss that Rio slumped into. But it certainly looks and feels like the ’old school’ Rio swagger is back.” The global mining industry is rebounding from a downturn that forced some of the top producers to sell assets, cut costs and rein in spending after years of over-investment bloated balance sheets and left markets oversupplied. Iron ore, Rio’s main profit driver, surged 81 percent last year as Chinese stimulus supported local steel output, leading to better demand for overseas ore. “Rio is in good shape today,” Chief Executive Officer Jean Sebastien Jacques said on a call with reporters after the results. “We have kept our promises. We have delivered cost savings. We have strengthened the quality of our portfolio. We are investing for the long term and at the same time we have strengthened our balance sheet.” The company is in a “strong position to deliver superior shareholder returns,” he added. Shares Rebound Rio shares rebounded from a seven-year low to rally 60 percent in London in 2016. The stock is up 9 percent this year and reached an almost four-year high in late January. The Sydney-traded shares rose 0.8 percent to close at A$65.69 on Wednesday. Prices for iron ore delivered to China are near a two-year high. The main question for Rio and competitors including BHP Billiton Ltd. and Vale SA is whether the rally can be sustained. “The government has implemented stimulus packages for some time now and we believe they will continue, especially in the context of the leadership conference scheduled for the fourth quarter in Beijing,” Jacques told reporters. “The property and construction market is doing pretty well. As far as China is concerned, we do not have a big issue today.“ Banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. are seeking to gauge how easily new low-cost supply will be absorbed and if higher prices will prompt additional output. There are signs that Chinese customers are well stocked. Inventories at Chinese ports reached a record last week and shipments from Australia’s Port Hedland hit an all-time high for the month of January. Shortly before taking over the CEO role from Sam Walsh in July, Jacques outlined his vision to grow the company through investing in existing projects and expanding profitable operations, rather than focusing on deals.

Getty Images Jacques is leading the 144-year-old mining giant’s retreat from coal as part of a broader plan to slim Rio’s asset base that has resulted in $7.7 billion of disposals since 2013. Last month, he agreed to sell most of the company’s thermal coal assets to a firm controlled by China’s Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. for $2.45 billion. The sale, which would leave Rio with just two remaining coal mines once completed, had raised expectations of bigger returns to shareholders. Rio’s net debt fell 30 percent to $9.6 billion at the end of last year. The coal disposal could help reduce borrowings to $3.9 billion by the end of 2017, Deutsche Bank AG has said.

Hundreds of men and women convened on Liberty Street around 6 p.m., most with signs in hand and their voices raised together in a rally against Donald Trump and his potential plans to roll back financial regulations put in place after the 2008 recession during the Obama administration. They met on the steps of a banking skyscraper - home to JP Morgan Chase. "Tonight we want to get across that Trump is basically helping bankers rob America," one protester said. "Rob it from working families and cause another economic session." Although President Trump campaigned on a promise to "Drain the Swamp" or to rid Washington of insider politics, many told PIX11 the recent Cabinet appointments including former Goldman Sachs partner Steve Mnuchin as Secretary of Treasury leaves them concerned. "We now have basically Goldman Sachs on power and Jamie Diamond in power righting legislation to roll back Dodd Frank which was put in place to protect us the American consumer," a demonstrator said. Alex Green was among the crowd hoping that under the current administration the interests of everyday Americans will not come to second to the demands of big banks.

The timing of any potential move isn't clear. If the changes occur, they would mark the second major shake-up in the bank's most senior management ranks since John Cryan became chief executive in 2015. A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Urwin, a former J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. banker who joined Deutsche Bank in early 2015, was named to the management board later that year in an overhaul under Mr. Cryan. Mr. Urwin, 61 years old, has told colleagues he plans to retire, according to people familiar with the matter. He is British and has been overseeing the investment bank while based in New York. Mr. Urwin didn't respond to requests for comment. Mr. Schenck, 51 years old, joined Deutsche Bank in January 2015 from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he was a banker and partner. A German, he previously was chief financial officer of German utility E.ON SE. Mr. Schenck didn't respond to requests for comment. The discussions come at a time when the Frankfurt-based lender has been battling a costly series of legal matters and faced investor uncertainty over its strategy and capital position. A reshuffling of senior executives would follow moves that have already started to cut expenses and thousands of jobs and exit businesses. Mr. Cryan, who replaced Deutsche Bank co-CEO Anshu Jain in mid-2015, later that year split the investment bank in half, separating deal-advisory and securities underwriting from the trading unit. In that restructuring, Mr. Urwin was named to run the corporate and investment bank while Garth Ritchie, who had run equities trading, was named head of global markets. The move elevated both men to the management board. Mr. Urwin told colleagues and senior executives around that time that he was reluctant to take on the management-board role, which carries legal liabilities and other added duties shared by the top executives, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Urwin did take on the role. He since has been focused on helping rebuild Deutsche Bank's strained relationships with regulators and hiring for senior banker jobs, such as European investment-banking chief and global head of mergers and acquisitions. Seven months ago, Mr. Urwin took on expanded management-board duties, including oversight of U.S. operations at the corporate level. A Briton, Mr. Urwin has been overseeing the investment bank from New York. The expanded role involves managing sometimes-thorny relationships with U.S. regulators and operations of a newly organized holding company that includes the U.S. trading and banking businesses. The past year has been tumultuous for the German bank, which has struggled to stem billions of dollars in fines for past alleged misbehavior. Since December, it has agreed to pay roughly $8 billion to settle allegations tied to toxic mortgage securities and what regulators described as lax controls to prevent money laundering. Other potential legal settlements still loom. The legal fines, along with weak performances in key businesses and waning market share in trading, have cut into Deutsche Bank's capital cushion. This is what banks set aside to meet regulatory demands and protect against losses. Deutsche Bank dramatically cut employee bonuses this year, and management-board members aren't getting bonuses for the second year in a row. The austerity measures, along with job cuts and shrinking businesses, have hurt morale, bankers and other employees say. At the same time, the bank has had some wins. It nabbed a lead underwriting role in last month's public offering of Blackstone Group LP's Invitation Homes Inc. The offering raised $1.54 billion, making it the largest U.S.-listed IPO in more than a year. The corporate and investment bank, with more than 16,000 employees, had EUR7.5 billion ($8 billion) in revenue in 2016, a 7% decline from 2015, and 2016 income before taxes of EUR1.7 billion. The business's 2015 results were burdened by investment-bank write-downs and legal costs.
