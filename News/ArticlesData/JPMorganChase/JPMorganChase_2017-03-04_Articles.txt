 One of the most senior women on Wall Street just issued a rallying cry for stock pickers Matt Turner Feb. 28, 2017, 12:12 PM 3,566 facebook linkedin twitter email print Mary Erdoes, JPMorgan's CEO of asset and wealth management. Fortune Live Media via flickr Mary Erdoes, CEO of asset and wealth management at JPMorgan, just issued a rallying cry. Speaking to a room full of stock analysts at JPMorgan's investor day, she provided an impassioned defense of active management and Wall Street research. "The world is changing, and you cannot doubt the ability for human beings to pick good stocks over bad stocks," she said. "You, too, should not doubt yourself in the job you're in." 2016 was one of the most challenging years for professional stock-pickers. According to research from JPMorgan's US equity strategy, only 32% of active quant funds and active long-only funds outperformed their benchmarks in 2016. Investors pulled $200 billion from active US equity funds over 2016 — the single largest annual rotation out of active management. Referring to the challenges facing the industry — such as the flow of money from active management to passive management and the shift from human money managers to computer-driven investing — Erdoes highlighted a selection of stories from decades ago. "These are the same headlines year in, year out," she said. JPMorgan "We don't believe the debate is active versus passive," she said. "It is active and passive. We need those as building blocks for strong portfolios for the future." She made a similar argument about the computer-versus-human debate, saying that both are needed, rather than one or the other. "Human beings need human beings to explain the world to them, and that's our job," she said. "Siri is not going to hold your hand and help you get through these tough markets," she added. Of course, JPMorgan has an interest in defending active management. Asset and wealth management clients' assets hit $2.5 trillion in 2016, a record high. Erdoes shared a slide showing JPMorgan's fund performance. The chart shows the proportion of assets in mutual funds that are ranked above their respective peer category media over different time frames to the end of 2016. Erdoes said the one-year number would be even higher on a rolling 12-month basis, as it would strip the impact of January 2016 and include a strong performance in early 2017.

And Social Security Administration data will no longer be used to try to block individuals with disabling mental health issues from buying handguns, nor will hunters be banned from using lead-based bullets, which can accidentally poison wildlife, on 150 million acres of federal lands. These are just a few of the more than 90 regulations that federal agencies and the Republican-controlled Congress have delayed, suspended or reversed in the month and a half since President Trump took office, according to a tally by The New York Times. Sign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter The emerging effort — dozens of additional rules could be eliminated in the coming weeks — represents one of the most significant shifts in regulatory policy in recent decades. It is the leading edge of what Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, described late last month as “the deconstruction of the administrative state.” In many cases, records show that the changes came after appeals by corporate lobbyists and trade association executives, who see a potentially historic opportunity to lower compliance costs and drive up profits. Slashing regulations, they argue, will unleash economic growth. On a near daily basis, regulated industries are now sending in specific requests to the Trump administration for more rollbacks, including recent appeals from 17 automakers to rescind an agreement to increase mileage standards for their fleets, and another from pharmaceutical industry figures to reverse a new rule that tightens scrutiny over the marketing of prescription drugs for unapproved uses. As of late Friday, word had leaked that the automakers’ request for a rollback was about to be granted, too. “After a relentless, eight-year regulatory onslaught that loaded unprecedented burdens on businesses and the economy, relief is finally on the way,” Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a memo last week. But dozens of public interest groups — environmentalists, labor unions, consumer watchdogs — have sounded the alarm about the potential threat to Americans’ well-being. “Americans did not vote to be exposed to more health, safety, environmental and financial dangers,” said one letter, signed by leaders of 137 nonprofit groups, that was sent to the White House last week. In other cases, the Obama-era rules under attack have drawn objections even from some liberal groups that called them examples of overreach, like the American Civil Liberties Union’s protest of a system to block mentally ill people from buying guns. The regulatory retrenchment is unfolding on multiple fronts. Congress, with Mr. Trump’s approval, has erased three Obama-era rules in the last month, lifting regulations related to coal mining and oil and gas exploration, as well as the sale of guns to the mentally ill. More than 25 additional rules could also be erased in the coming weeks, with the House having already voted to eliminate nearly half of them. Mr. Trump has separately signed executive orders directing agencies to pursue the reversal of other rules, including a requirement that financial advisers act in the interest of their clients, and a rule aimed at protecting drinking water from pollution. New White House appointees at agencies including the Federal Communications Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency have also personally intervened in recent weeks to block, delay or start the process to nullify other rules, such as a requirement that corporations publish tallies comparing chief executive pay with average employee wages. The Trump administration has also imposed a broad regulatory freeze, instructing agencies to delay the adoption of any rules not already in effect, and to consider whether those rules should be targeted for elimination. And, through yet more executive orders, it has set up barriers to enact any new regulations — such as a requirement that for each new rule, at least two others must be identified for repeal — and ordered every federal agency to create a team of employees to look for more rules that can be eliminated. “By any empirical measure, it is a level of activity that has never been seen,” said Curtis W. Copeland, who spent decades studying federal regulatory policy on behalf of Congress while at the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office. “It is unprecedented.” Mr. Trump, in his address to Congress last week, called it “a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations,” a line that drew thunderous applause from Republicans. Presidents wield considerable influence over the rule-making process. They set the agenda and appoint the rule-makers, and, since the Reagan administration, a White House office has reviewed every major regulation to try to ensure that benefits to society exceeded compliance costs. It is not uncommon for new presidents to make quick changes in regulatory policy or try to reverse certain last-minute rules their predecessors enacted. Barack Obama, shortly after being elected president, pressed the E.P.A. to let the State of California set more stringent limits on auto emissions, a proposal that the Bush administration had rejected. But the courts have generally held that new administrations need to justify such reversals. The best-known case involved the Reagan administration, which tried to rescind a rule requiring airbags in passenger vehicles. The courts found the move unjustified. “It is not a relevant or adequate defense to say that the president told us to do it,” said Michael Eric Herz, a professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York. The Trump administration could face a host of similar challenges — the new requirement that agencies must find two regulations to eliminate before enacting any new rules is already being challenged in federal court by two liberal groups. In addition, Democratic attorneys general from New York, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Oregon and Vermont have threatened in recent days to sue the Trump administration to try to block some of the regulatory rollbacks. It is a radical role reversal for state attorneys general — their Republican colleagues spent the last eight years suing the federal government to block the enactment of many Obama-era rules. Now the Democrats are planning to try to prevent many of these same rules from being revoked. “Demolish the administrative state? I don’t even know what that means,” Attorney General Maura Healey of Massachusetts said during a visit to Washington last week, where she and other state attorneys general met with Mr. Trump at the White House. “But we need to wake up to what is actually going on.” But the pushback has hardly deterred industry executives. The Business Roundtable, which represents some of the nation’s largest corporations and is led by Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, went so far in mid-February as to give Mr. Trump a wish list of 16 rules it wants killed, including the mandatory disclosure of how much chief executives are paid compared with other employees, and a rule intended to curb the trade in minerals that might benefit militant groups in parts of Africa. Efforts to repeal at least 10 of the measures on this list are now underway. “The majority of these regulations directly and negatively impact economic growth,” the executives said in their letter, adding that they were convinced that rules could be repealed “without undermining critical protections for consumer health, safety and the environment.” The reversals by federal regulators are happening, at times, at an extraordinary speed. Lawyers representing the National Mining Association, the American Petroleum Institute and other fossil fuel trade groups and companies asked the Interior Department on Feb. 17 to suspend a new rule changing the way these companies pay royalties for oil, gas or coal extracted from federal lands. While the lawyers called the requirement “impractical and in some cases impossible,” environmentalists and even conservative nonprofit groups like Taxpayers for Common Sense praised the effort, saying that for decades energy companies had been underpaying the federal government. The new standard has been estimated to push up federal revenue by as much as $85 million annually. The Interior Department wrote the industry lawyers back five days later, telling them that the agency, after three years of backing the rule, would suspend enforcement of the new standards. “We agree you have raised serious questions,” the agency’s letter said. This shift in federal regulatory policy is already having implications for tens of thousands of citizens nationwide. Nearly two years ago, the Social Security Administration first moved to set up a new system that would automatically turn over to the Justice Department information it collects on Americans who are receiving federal benefits based on a disabling mental illness for inclusion in a database used for gun background checks. This would effectively prevent these individuals — an estimated 75,000 a year — from buying guns unless they sought a Justice Department waiver after being rejected, given the longstanding federal limitation on the sale of firearms to individuals with known mental illnesses. Groups like the National Rifle Association, the A.C.L.U. and the National Alliance on Mental Illness objected to the provision, which had been scheduled to go into effect in January. They argued that it unfairly presumed a tendency toward violence by a wide range of people with mental disabilities, including conditions like bulimia and obsessive compulsive disorder. Mr. Trump signed legislation on Tuesday revoking that rule under the Congressional Review Act, which gives Congress a limited window to overturn the decisions of regulatory agencies. A total of 46 such Congressional Review Act resolutions are now pending in Congress, on topics including air pollution, unemployment compensation, endangered species listings, debit card fees and oil and gas drilling on federal lands as well as the Arctic Outer Continental Shelf. The act, first adopted in 1996, had been used only once before to nullify a regulation, at the start of the Bush administration in 2001, when a Clinton-era rule was revoked. Rules not subject to congressional review may still be at risk. The most radical shift has perhaps come at the Federal Communications Commission, which voted on Wednesday to halt new government rules related to data security from taking effect this week, after objections were raised by companies including Comcast, Verizon and AT&T. Ajit Pai, a Republican whom Mr. Trump recently named as the F.C.C. chairman, has also made clear that he intends to push to roll back or abandon several other major rules, including the landmark net neutrality regulation intended to ensure equal access to content on the internet, as well as efforts to keep prison phone rates down and a proposal to break open the cable box market. The efforts have been praised by telecommunications giants, like Comcast, but condemned by consumer advocates. The administration started its campaign against regulation on the afternoon of Inauguration Day, with a memo from Reince Priebus, Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, instructing agencies to halt work on new regulations and to delay putting completed regulations into effect. So far, the effective dates of at least 75 rules have been delayed as a result of this order, based on an analysis of the Federal Register. That includes a measure intended to prevent potentially toxic formaldehyde exposure in homes caused by certain furniture products — an effort that has been underway since victims of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 were moved into contaminated government-issued trailers. Such delays are not uncommon with new presidents — both George W. Bush and Mr. Obama did the same, to differing degrees. And certain measures are still going into effect as the Trump administration gets underway, including one that prohibits smoking in public housing nationwide as of Feb. 3. Still, the general Trump administration freeze has drawn broad opposition, some of it surprising. The Department of Agriculture has delayed a rule that would make it easier for chicken farmers to sue chicken processors. Business groups, including the National Federation of Independent Business, want to kill the rule. But small-scale chicken farmers are fighting back. Mike Weaver, a West Virginia farmer who said he had voted for Mr. Trump and was pleased with most of what he had seen so far, said he wished Mr. Trump would meet with farmers. “I’d love to have a visit with the president about this, to tell him that these are federal regulations, yes, but these are good regulations,” said Mr. Weaver, the president of a small-farm group called the Organization for Competitive Markets. “These are regulations that we want implemented.” Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter.

 Here's what to expect from Wednesday's budget, Philip Hammond's first as Chancellor Oscar Williams-Grut Mar. 4, 2017, 4:30 AM 624 facebook linkedin twitter email print Chancellor Philip Hammond. Stefan Rousseau/PA Wire/PA Images The budget will be delivered on Wednesday, March 8 at 12.30 p.m. GMT. Analysts are expecting a "low-key affair." Growth forecasts are likely to be upgraded, borrowing forecasts likely to be cut. NHS funding and business rates reliefs are also likely. LONDON — Philip Hammond will deliver his first budget since becoming Chancellor on Wednesday, with analysts expecting a relatively modest affair. Hammond will step up to the dispatch box in Parliament at 12.30 p.m. GMT (7.20 a.m. ET) on Wednesday, March 8. It is his first budget since becoming Chancellor last July but his second major fiscal statement, following last November's Autumn Statement. The biggest headline from the Autumn Statement was a relaxing of fiscal targets, as Hammond ditched predecessor George Osborne's commitment to reach a budget surplus by 2020. This gives Hammond more financial wiggle room to deal with any Brexit-related economic headwinds. BI has combed through preview notes from UBS, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and Deutsche Bank to find out what the market is expecting from this year's budget. Here are the key takeaways: Growth up, borrowing down "The main focus at next week’s Budget is likely to be a large upgrade to the OBR’s 2017 growth forecast," says JPMorgan's Allan Monks. He is expecting the Office for Budget Responsibility to up its GDP growth forecast for this year from 1.4% to 1.9%. Other analysts are predicting a similar rise. It follows a string of better than expected economic numbers since last June's Brexit vote and momentum since last November's Autumn Statement. As a result of better-than-expected growth, most analysts are expecting a downgrade to borrowing forecasts and an improvement of public finances as the Treasury takes in more tax. This could free up between £10 billion and £15 billion a year for Hammond to play with, depending on which analyst you're reading. However, most are expecting Hammond to use the bulk of this cash to boost the government's £27 billion war chest, which the Chancellor has set aside to deal with any unexpected Brexit headwinds over the next few years. He warned ministers last month that there is "no pot of money under my desk," suggesting he is unwilling to spend much. Morgan Stanley's Jacob Neil, Melanie Baker, and team said: "Our judgment is that [Hammond] will seek to bank two-thirds of the improvement, reducing the deficit by about £10 billion per annum, to strengthen the capacity to respond to a possible Brexit slowdown – not least since growth so far has been resilient and he has another near-term opportunity to act in the autumn Budget, if required." 'Ease the squeeze' Chancellor Philip Hammond delivering his first Autumn Statement last November. PA/PA Wire/PA Images However, Morgan Stanley expects Hammond to spend the rest of his excess billions on "additional spending to 'ease the squeeze', softening the 2% per annum fall in real spending per capita embedded in current plans." Deutsche Bank thinks this will mean "more NHS spending, funds for social care and possibly also a relief for small businesses against the planned increase in business rates." Social care and NHS has become a huge issue over the last year, with both sectors facing crippling shortfalls in budgets. Some spending, even if tokenistic, on these issues would be well received. The press and businesses have also been vocal in attacking the new business rates regime. Morgan Stanley's Baker and Neil add: "We see scope for additional funding to implement the housing white paper vision of additional housebuilding." Cabinet member Sajid Javid delivered the white paper last month. Morgan Stanley expects these aggregate spending measures will amount to a maximum of £5 billion and will be fiscally neutral, i.e. totally funded by improved public finances rather than borrowing. Possible surprises: self-employed taxes, diesel Beyond headline-grabbing measures on the NHS and business rates, could the budget yield any surprises? Goldman Sachs writes: "On the tax side, there is a reasonable chance the Chancellor changes the tax treatment of self-employment which currently incurs a much lower rate of national insurance contributions than employees. We believe this anomaly will eventually be addressed by HM Treasury and that may begin in this Budget." The Institute for Fiscal Studies recently calculated that the self-employed enjoy a £1,240 tax advantage over employees, calling the current system "costly, inefficient, and unfair." The budget box. Hannah McKay/PA Wire/PA Images Goldman adds that "incentives to encourage the early trading-in of diesel-fuelled cars may also be on the cards," given that air pollution and smog have become big issues this year, with London already breaching its annual limit. However, analysts are less sure of what to expect than in past budgets. Morgan Stanley said: "The government has made less use of pre-Budget briefing than Osborne and the Cameron government, and there is a higher-than-usual level of uncertainty around the economic outlook, given Brexit. Both factors make forecasting government fiscal decisions more challenging." Despite Hammond's silence on possible giveaways, analysts are not expecting the kind of "rabbit out of the hat" surprises that typified George Osborne's budgets. Deutsche Bank says: "Hammond’s intention is for UK fiscal policy to become more "boring"," and JPMorgan say they expect a "low-key affair." Hammond signalled at the last Autumn Statement that he is scrapping the tradition of twice-a-year financial updates, instead moving the full budget to autumn and making it the only annual update. As a result, this spring budget is something of a stop gap. Goldman writes: "We do not expect the Budget to be a major macro or fiscal event... there may be more news from the Budget at a sector level in terms of both tax and public spending announcements, although here too our expectations are modest."

While Republicans in Congress work to turn this rhetoric into reality, and get bogged down in debating the comprehensive tax reform facets like the border adjustable tax, American small business job creators need and want tax relief now. Small businesses are unique because they do not have access to the tax lawyers, lobbyists, and fixers of their wealthier and better connected counterparts. That’s why tax reform must be broader than just focusing on the country’s anti-competitive corporate tax rate — it must focus on providing relief for America’s 28 million small businesses and the 85 million Americans who owe their livelihoods to them. ADVERTISEMENT These businesses have been struggling under the weight of a 40 percent marginal federal tax burden, which can reach 50 percent when state taxes are included, and 60 percent when payroll and other taxes are added in. That’s nearly the most onerous in the world, according to the Tax Foundation.   Is this any way to treat the job creation engine of the economy? Small businesses account for two-thirds of new jobs, half of existing jobs, and a significant portion of the new innovations that improve our quality of life. This heavy tax burden dramatically reduces their ability to expand, create jobs, and raise wages. Two out of three small business owners admitted as much in a recent nationwide poll conducted by the Job Creators Network. Economic indicators also suggest small businesses are struggling. A new JPMorgan Chase study shows that small business expansion is negligible. Meanwhile, the decades-long slowdown in new business creation continues. The share of businesses less than a year old has plummeted by one-third and their employment share by half since the 1980s. Yet small business optimism has surged since the election of Donald TrumpDonald TrumpDHS head: US may seek better vetting from 13 or 14 more nations Student objects to Trump University settlement: report Overnight Cybersecurity: Comey, Trump at odds on wiretapping | Obama advisers press Trump to act on cyber MORE. Owners are hopeful that the “you didn’t build that” mentality in Washington for the past eight years has come to an end. Tax relief would provide a greater incentive to start and grow businesses, which would employ some of the tens of millions of Americans who are part of the long-term unemployed, “prime-age” quitters of the labor force, and underemployed. Outside of Washington the business owners and workers laugh when they hear that unemployment rate is less than 5 percent. Correctly measured, one in 10 Americans is unemployed. What would such small business tax reform look like? House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin BradyKevin BradyOvernight Healthcare: GOP releases ObamaCare bills House GOP bill repeals ObamaCare taxes — with one exception GOP releases bills to repeal and replace ObamaCare MORE (R-Texas) has a good tax bill that would chop the tax rate to 25 percent. That's a start. Even better is a bill called the Bring Small Businesses Back Tax Reform Act, which will be introduced tomorrow by Reps. Rand Hultgren (R-Ill.) and Jason Smith (R-Mo.). This bill would lower the tax rate on the first $150,000 of small business income to only 12 percent, and to 25 percent for all income above that threshold. While some critics argue against lower taxes on small businesses for fear of “gaming the system” and “avoiding payroll taxes,” there is a solution: create a simple, straightforward rule with appropriate safeguards around reasonable compensation. This would end years of legal controversy and uneven IRS enforcement. Some business owners may not like such a rule, but this opposition cannot stand in the way of real tax relief for millions of others. Hultgren and Smith’s legislation would allow for immediate expensing of all equipment, meaning an end to the hassle of complicated depreciation schedules and reduced tax compliance costs. The third and final part would allow for cash accounting, allowing small businesses to defer income declaration until payment is actually received. Such small business tax relief is needed now. While comprehensive tax reform for individuals is a worthy effort, that may take time to work out. For now, congress should deliver pro-jobs business reform. It’s been 30 years since businesses have gotten a break from IRS tyranny and delivering relief this year will help employers and their workers alike. We even think a business tax reform bill for these 85 million Americans who depend on small businesses will get the backing of some Democrats. Who isn’t for small business and jobs?

Mikko Perez of Ayannah and Simon Bakker of Kennemer were handpicked as the 9th and 10th Philippine-based high-impact entrepreneurs at Endeavor’s 69th international selection panel held in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Growing up in the Philippines, Perez witnessed poverty firsthand. After graduating with honors from Ateneo de Manila, he left the city to become a community organizer and adult educator in the countryside. It was there that he realized how entrepreneurship could uplift poor families out of poverty. ADVERTISEMENT After graduating from Harvard Business School, he worked for JP Morgan’s technology investment banking group in San Francisco and Next Century Partners where he managed a private equity fund. During his stint in the US, Mikko started to view modern technology as a way to address infrastructure gaps in his home country. He co-founded Chikka, a mobile instant messaging service that was acquired by PLDT in 2009. Fueled by Chikka’s success, Mikko founded Ayannah, which seeks to address the Philippines’ $40-billion underserved domestic remittance and financial services industry. As urban-rural remittances continue to be predominantly cash-based, some taking place through pawnshops, he saw the existing process as costly and inefficient. Perez and his team of engineers built Sendah, an electronic platform that gives unbanked Filipinos easy access to a suite of financial products and services through a network of 7,000 agents that include pawnshops, convenience stores and other retail establishments as well as individuals. “The [Endeavor] ISP (international selection panel) was a unique opportunity to learn from amazing mentors and entrepreneurs from around the world. The feedback helped us refine our business plan and prepare to take our business to the next level to achieve market leadership in the Philippines and expand to other emerging markets,” Perez said. “The Endeavor network gives us access to a collaborative community working to build businesses that create value and social impact,” he said. Dutch entrepreneur Simon Bakker earned a Masters in Economics from the University of Amsterdam, afterwards serving as the managing director for Asia-Pacific at Fidelity National Information Services, a US banking and payments technology company. He arrived in the Philippines in 1994. His first venture was as co-founder of Enderun Colleges. As the company grew, the founders took in more partners that left Bakker thirsting to start his own company. Inspired by his homeland’s connection to the chocolate industry, Simon started a business that involved buying cacao beans from Filipino farmers in 2011. Soon after, he met with buying representatives and shared success stories of consolidated growership programs around the world. While most growership arrangements only offer support in one area— such as planting and using fertilizers—Simon believed a true end-to-end support organization could increase overall productivity, revenue, and social impact. Though the Philippines has farmed cacao for over 300 years, it has historically been a low-yield, backyard crop. Simon hired agronomists to develop cacao growing and post-harvest technology and worked with local banks to develop cacao loan programs to help farmers establish new farms. Today, Kennemer supplies best-in-industry knowledge, planting materials, fertilizers, and loan products, multiplying the productivity of Philippine smallholder farmers by four times on average to bring a 300-600 percent increase in their annual income. This not only supplies Kennemer with a steady source of high-quality fermented cocoa beans to export to global clients but also transforms the lives of millions of smallholder farmers. “The ISP was a rare experience. The Endeavor panelist provided me with valuable feedback on how to further scale up our cacao sourcing model. At the same time, the interaction with my fellow entrepreneurs from various regions in the world was truly inspiring,” Bakker said. play_circle_filled Duterte confirms existence of DDS during martial law March 07, 2017 play_circle_filled Duterte to CA: Allow Gina Lopez to present her mining stance March 07, 2017 play_circle_filled Nationwide smoking ban to include indoor cigarette use, says Palace March 07, 2017 play_circle_filled Palace: There was a 'certain attempt' to influence Duterte financially March 07, 2017 TAGS: Business, Cacao, Filipino financial technology (fintech) For feedback, complaints, or inquiries, contact us.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) Share story By SARAH SKIDMORE SELL The Associated Press Medical expenses are a burden whenever they hit, but a recent study found they’re most common around this time of year. The study found that one in six families makes a major medical payment in any given year, and they tended to occur in the first few months of the year. The study found the median payment was $1,143 and most households take more than a year to recover from the hit. Although the reason for the timing is unclear, researchers at economic think tank JP Morgan Chase Institute who conducted the study hypothesize that people are either putting off treatment or bill paying until tax refund time when they can afford it, or simply facing a fresh new set of deductibles and other out-of-pocket insurance expenses to meet for the year.

SAVE It’s much easier to bear big expenses when you have some emergency savings. If you don’t have much set aside, you aren’t alone. Two-thirds of Americans would have difficulty coming up with the money to cover a $1,000 emergency, according to a poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Start small, automate your savings and try to keep your hands off it unless you really need it.

The study found that one in six families makes a major medical payment in any given year, and they tended to occur in the first few months of the year. The study found the median payment was $1,143 and most households take more than a year to recover from the hit. Although the reason for the timing is unclear, researchers at economic think tank JP Morgan Chase Institute who conducted the study hypothesize that people are either putting off treatment or bill paying until tax refund time when they can afford it, or simply facing a fresh new set of deductibles and other out-of-pocket insurance expenses to meet for the year. We gathered a few expert tips for managing the pain of medical expenses: SAVE It's much easier to bear big expenses when you have some emergency savings. If you don't have much set aside, you aren't alone. Two-thirds of Americans would have difficulty coming up with the money to cover a $1,000 emergency, according to a poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

The study found that one in six families makes a major medical payment in any given year, and they tended to occur in the first few months of the year. The study found the median payment was $1,143 and most households take more than a year to recover from the hit. Although the reason for the timing is unclear, researchers at economic think tank JP Morgan Chase Institute who conducted the study hypothesize that people are either putting off treatment or bill paying until tax refund time when they can afford it, or simply facing a fresh new set of deductibles and other out-of-pocket insurance expenses to meet for the year. Federal employee bill tracker: How pending legislation could affect your bottom line We gathered a few expert tips for managing the pain of medical expenses: Advertisement SAVE It’s much easier to bear big expenses when you have some emergency savings. If you don’t have much set aside, you aren’t alone. Two-thirds of Americans would have difficulty coming up with the money to cover a $1,000 emergency, according to a poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Start small, automate your savings and try to keep your hands off it unless you really need it. Other preventative steps include staying within your health insurer’s network or bundling your care so you reach deductibles sooner. You may also want to get an estimate of costs ahead of time so you can better prepare. Some providers and insurers will help with this or you can use Amino, a free online service that estimates the costs of many common health care procedures. VERIFY Review all your bills carefully when they arrive. About half of medical bills contain errors, said Caitlin Donovan of the National Patient Advocate Foundation. Make sure you are being billed only for services and goods you received. If you feel like you are being billed for something that should be covered by insurance, reach out to your plan for an explanation. You can also appeal any decision by your insurer not to pay. There are companies that will audit bills for you to make sure they are correct. Some, like Remedy, will only take a percentage of what they save you as payment. You can also reach out to a patient advocate organization for assistance. SEEK AID If you cannot foot the bill at all, seek help as soon as possible. Hospitals are often willing to negotiate the amount you owe or set up a payment plan. Ask if they have a financial assistance plan or know of one that could help you. There are many nonprofit organizations set up specifically to help people manage their medical bills. Also consider seeking help from friends or family with a crowdfunding page, such as Gofundme.com.

But by September 2016, the share of loans by these three big banks dropped to 21 percent. (AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews, FILE)   Michele Lerner The Washington Post     Most borrowers, whether they are purchasing property or refinancing their home, focus on their mortgage rate and loan terms rather than the type of lender they choose. Yet the landscape of the lending market has shifted dramatically over the past few years from domination by big banks to a market where more loans are made by non-banks -- financial institutions that only make loans and do not offer deposit accounts such as a savings account or checking account. "For consumers, it doesn't really matter whether you get your loan through a bank or a non-bank, although in some ways non-banks are a little more nimble and can offer more loan products," said Paul Noring, a managing director of the financial-risk-management practice of Navigant Consulting in Washington, D.C. "The impact is bigger on the housing market overall, because without the non-banks we would be even further behind where we should be in terms of the number of transactions." In 2011, 50 percent of all new mortgage money was loaned by the three biggest banks in the United States: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. But by September 2016, the share of loans by these three big banks dropped to 21 percent. At the same time, six of the top 10 largest lenders by volume were non-banks, such as Quicken Loans, loanDepot and PHH Mortgage, compared with just two of the top 10 in 2011. --- Before the financial crisis, mortgages were the last thing a consumer would default on, Noring said. "That flipped in 2009, when people started defaulting on their mortgages first," he said. "That was a tsunami for everyone in the mortgage business, and we're still seeing the fallout. Lenders were not prepared to deal with it and didn't do a great job, plus new rules were coming out that they needed to follow." The withdrawal of banks from the mortgage business is the result of the fundamental shift in regulations that took place in response to the housing crisis, said Meg Burns, managing director of the Collingwood Group, an adviser for financial services companies in D.C. "The regulatory atmosphere changed from a risk-management regime to a zero-tolerance and 100-percent-compliance regime," Burns said. "Not only were new regulations implemented, but new regulators like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were created. At the same time, the CFPB and other agencies became more assertive in their enforcement practices." Burns said that stepped-up regulations from the CFPB include prescriptive rules that pinpoint exactly how lenders are to make loan decisions. "The intent should be to broadly make sure borrowers can repay their loans and sustain homeownership instead of this narrow approach," Burns said. "In the face of stiff penalties and aggressive scrutiny, banks were left with a tremendous uncertainty and risk that made it hard to keep lending." Jeffrey Taylor, managing partner of Digital Risk, a provider of mortgage-processing services and risk analytics in Maitland, Florida, said that while the post-crisis regulations were well-intentioned, the result was to make banks more cautious. "Now banks only approve 'perfect' loans, not 'good-enough' loans," Taylor said. "This created an opportunity for non-banks that focus entirely on mortgages and are less regulated than big banks." The cost of complying with new regulations and the risk of making mistakes drove many banks to reduce their mortgage business, said Rick Sharga, chief marketing officer of Ten-X, an online real estate marketplace in Irvine, California. "Headline risk is another element of this, because if the media perceives you're doing something incorrectly, it can really hurt your entire business," he said. In the initial aftermath of the housing crisis and the debacle of loan defaults, banks began to add their own overlays, which are loan-approval guidelines and fees that go beyond the requirements of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said Susan Wachter, a professor of real estate and finance at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Not only have banks reduced their mortgage loan volume, but the entire private market of investors in mortgages disappeared in 2007 and 2008 and, unlike other financial markets, has yet to come back, Wachter said. "The aftermath of the crisis was lots of litigation and a decline in trust across the board," Wachter said. Banks were forced to pay fines and to take back loans that were considered flawed. At the same time, they were required to meet stress tests and have more capital on their books in case they have to handle more defaults, Wachter said. "Non-banks don't have to have capital, which could mean that taxpayers are more exposed than in 2009 if numerous defaults take place among loans made by non-banks," Wachter said. Noring said that non-banks were more lightly regulated in the initial aftermath of the housing crisis, although in the past two years, regulators have stepped up their scrutiny of these lenders. Non-banks are regulated in every state where they are licensed to provide loans, said David Norris, chief revenue officer for loanDepot in Foothill Ranch, California. "Prior to the financial meltdown, loan-guarantee fees charged by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were substantially lower for banks compared to non-banks, but as part of the financial reform, those fees are now similar for all types of lenders," Norris said. "Now banks and non-banks are competing on a level playing field, which encouraged more non-banks to increase their business." Many large banks have reduced their FHA loan business. Burns said FHA loans were created to serve people with a riskier profile, but she said the recent zero-tolerance policy of the Justice Department has undermined this loan program. "Lenders were supposed to use good judgment on FHA loan approvals, such as looking at the continuity and stability of the borrower's income," Burns said. "The DOJ has used the False Claims Act to target banks in particular to fine them for defects in loan files. But a 'perfect' loan is pretty much impossible, particularly for borrowers applying for FHA loans." FHA loans appeal to first-time buyers and lower-income borrowers, who are perceived to be more likely to default on a loan, Norris said. He said non-banks are originating more FHA loans to make up for the lack of banks offering the loans. --- Many banks now limit their loans to conventional 30-year fixed-rate loans for borrowers who neatly fit into the approval box, said Sharga of Ten-X. "Banks are also approving jumbo loans for high-net-worth individuals that they keep as portfolio loans," Sharga said. "They are offering these loans so they can sell other banking services to those customers." During the last housing boom, many non-bank lenders targeted subprime borrowers, he said. "This time around, the non-bank lenders are not being reckless," Sharga said. "Some offer loans to borrowers with lower FICO scores, but they are still not making risky loans. Consumers are benefiting from non-banks because they offer more opportunities to borrowers who are not perfect." On the negative side, though, Sharga said that competition from non-banks has contributed to the closing of many community banks, which particularly hurts communities that are geographically underserved. The entire ecosystem of the mortgage markets is fragile, said Burns, which has a chilling effect on the economy. "The lack of access to credit not only hurts consumers, but it hurts builders and therefore contributes to the lack of affordable housing," Burns said. "That, in turn, has an impact on the broader economy, because housing construction impacts a lot of segments such as banking, construction workers, home-improvement businesses and more." The pullback in lending from banks contributes to the overall decline in homeownership, said Burns, because people with a slightly risky credit profile are underserved. "The expansion of non-banks in response is a good thing, but we're still missing a million or more homeowners, in part because many millennials are still not able to get credit through traditional means," Wachter said. "For good or bad, consumers with marginal credit scores and unverifiable income are out of the market now." --- Rather than decide on a bank or non-bank, many borrowers focus primarily on the price of their loan or opt for a lender that provides them with other financial services or one recommended by a real estate company or builder they are using for a purchase. According to the J.D. Power 2016 U.S. Primary Mortgage Origination Satisfaction Study, 27 percent of first-time buyers regret their choice of a lender and 21 percent of all borrowers regret their choice. The most common reasons for dissatisfaction include lack of communication, unmet promises or feeling pressured to choose a particular loan. But choosing one type of lender over another is no guarantee of satisfaction. The top 10 most highly rated mortgage providers in the survey are evenly split between banks and non-banks. Digital Risk's Taylor said banks and non-banks are aware that customers who don't feel as if they are well-served will find another provider, which is why so many financial institutions are investing heavily in technology. "It's a race to improve the customer experience," he said. "Borrowers realize that there's not a lot of difference between loan providers on pricing, so they focus on the ease of the loan process and the service they receive." Taylor said there are generational differences in the way consumers approach borrowing money. "Generation Xers and baby boomers have more loyalty to their financial institutions and tend to look first for a credit card, a car loan or a mortgage to their bank," he said. "Millennials don't feel the same way and prefer to start with an internet search for their best mortgage options." --- Rising interest rates and anticipated deregulation under the Trump administration could change the mortgage-lending business again and impact the volume of loans. "We're likely to see more banks come back into the mortgage market as interest rates rise, because there's more profit to be made," Wachter said. "But demand will be down because fewer people will refinance and because affordability issues will mean that first-time buyers are still missing from the market." Sharga said that rising rates increase profitability but also reduce refinancing, which forces lenders to compete harder for purchase-loan business, so even borrowers with a few minor issues with their loan application may qualify for a loan. "Higher interest rates will cause funding costs to rise for non-banks, since they have to borrow money from capital markets to make their loans," said Navigant Consulting's Noring. "That could mean a rebalancing among lenders because banks fund their loans with deposits." Burns, however, thinks addressing regulatory issues will have a bigger impact on the lending atmosphere than rising rates. "The mortgage industry is overregulated now, so the goal should be to align important safeguards and yet get more investors and lenders back into the market," Taylor said. "I expect we'll see some right-setting of regulations so that different products can come into the mortgage market." In particular, Taylor anticipates the use of different metrics to evaluate borrowers rather than focusing tightly on FICO scores as lenders do now. "There are already opportunities to make smart decisions based on other data, such as Fannie Mae's Day 1 Certainty program that uses independent tools to validate a borrower's income, assets and employment and make it simpler and faster for lenders to approve loans," Taylor said. "The ultimate winner will be customers, because the more clarity a lender has on what it takes to get a loan, the less risk the lender has to take." Both bank and non-bank lenders are impacted by regulations and guidelines from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. "If the Trump administration is successful in relaxing regulations, then the headwinds lenders face could be slowing down," Sharga said. "That would be good for consumers and for the housing market, as long as it doesn't lead to the laxity and craziness of the previous housing boom."

The firm is offering clients more platform customization — opening up APIs for tailored apps and offering tools to integrate analytics services. On price, Symphony’s monthly product fee of $15 per head is comparatively low. This puts it within budgetary reach of non-financial services firms. Symphony is also a cheaper alternative for the Wall Street trading crowd than Bloomberg’s chat tool, which comes on Bloomberg’s Terminal analytics platform with thousand dollar plus monthly fees. “We started in financial services, but there are other markets,” said Symphony CEO David Gurle. “Think about manufacturing, defense, insurance, energy, which are very [business-to-business] centric and the relative value of confidentiality, of data ownership, and security of information is extremely high.” Bloomberg Influence, Goldman Roots Symphony has been touted as a “Bloomberg killer”, launched by a cabal of Wall Street firms in 2014 after Bloomberg News journalists reportedly snooped on Bloomberg Terminal client messages. That’s not exactly the story. An independent review indicated Bloomberg reporters had viewed employee login frequency, rather than message content, of some Terminal clients. And the predecessor to Symphony―an internal Goldman chat platform called LiveCurrent — was already in use dating back to 2012, explained a Goldman Sachs spokesperson. Goldman developed LiveCurrent largely due to the upsurge of non-secure SMS and social media services for messaging and breaking news. Goldman had a limited number of Bloomberg’s $20K plus a head Terminal subscriptions and it was not feasible to expand those only for the secure chat function. “We needed a practical way for the firm’s 30,000 employees to share news and information real-time and  Bloomberg’s Terminal was just too expensive for that,” said the Goldman spokesperson. The firm recognized the value of its messaging app as an industry-wide platform. In 2014, Goldman connected LiveCurrent to a consortium of 14 financial firms (including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and BlackRock), acquired existing messaging startup Perzo for $66 million, and put it all together to launch Symphony. Capturing Seats David Gurle estimates the potential market for Symphony’s secure messaging product at 100 million individual seats, with 8-10 million of those in financial services and 20 million in insurance, education, government, and healthcare. The strategy for capturing those seats is twofold, according to Gurle. Within financial services firms, Symphony looks to leverage the product’s adaptability to “integrate with other systems” and “expand as a collaboration tool…to the rest of the organization.” Outside of finance, Gurle points to the product’s “value proposition to other organizations” and the planned “launch of a salesforce this year to go after them.” Of course, underpinning the success of Symphony and its competitors is the ability to ensure secure communications in a world that’s seen epic digital breaches over the last year. Any major failure carries a high level of reputational risk, according to Gartner Research Director Adam Preset. “Obviously, your business model is in danger if you don’t do the job,” he said. Symphony views both product privacy and usability as key. “We’ve had to develop a system that is both convenient, but with security measures that are unbeatable,” said Gurle, referencing the product’s end-to-end encryption and “two-factor authentication.”  Expanding Playing Field As it pursues a larger client base on Wall Street and beyond, Symphony finds itself in a competitive and expanding marketplace. In financial services, Bloomberg’s Terminal is still dominant. The product’s entry price is $24,000 annually and it has 325,000 users worldwide, according to a Bloomberg rep speaking on background. Bloomberg does not currently offer the option to separate its messaging service from the Terminal for a lower price. Thomson Reuters’ Eikon analytics product―a Bloomberg Terminal rival―offers its Eikon Messenger service on the overall platform or separately for free, according to a company spokesperson. Eikon Messenger users reached 300,000 at the end of 2016, surging after the discontinuation of Yahoo Messenger. Thomson Reuters would not verify how many use its chat service for free vs the paid Eikon platform. The company does not provide public pricing info, but a fully loaded Eikon setup is said to cost roughly $20K annually. Both Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters have taken steps over the last several years to open up APIs and allow greater customization of their analytics product platforms. In its bid to expand, Symphony faces competition from many secure comms providers. Gartner’s Preset highlights two categories. “There are services that do secure communications, instant messaging, email, and serve audit and compliance purposes, and integrate with third-party systems,” he said. “Then there are others that focus purely on just a secure mobile vending app.” Similar to Symphony and Bloomberg’s IP, Preset named Global Relay and Ice Chat as confidential comms services with more expansive B2B application and functionality. He highlighted Wickr and Signal as apps with more crossover to general institutional and personal use. “There are about 60 different vendors out there solving the problem of secure messaging across different verticals. It’s extremely competitive,” said Preset. In the financial services chat and analytics world — given the resources behind Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters products — Symphony is more likely to force greater adaptability and downward price pressure than to kill either of the leaders off. And in the broader secure comms market, time will tell if Symphony can tap the growing demand faster than a crowded list of competitors.

Advertisement More stories                Tools Increase Text Decrease Text Reset Text Print Article Walter T. Yurt, an American travel writer based in Kuala Lumpur. – Pictures by Choo Choy MayKUALA LUMPUR, March 5 — Walter T. Yurt is used to being stared at. A tall, bald American man, he is a formidable presence despite his gentle giant demeanour. Whether it’s visiting his friend’s family in rural Kedah or exploring the majestic Angkor Wat in Cambodia, he’s used to standing out and attracting curious attention from locals. Which is a fantastic thing when you’re travel writer collecting experiences and stories. The author of two books, Finding Myself: The Adventures of An American in Malaysia and its sequel Finding My World: The Further Adventures of an American in South-east Asia and Beyond, Yurt hails from Louisville, Kentucky. He recalls an idyllic childhood with his parents and younger sister, in “one of the coolest neighbourhoods in America, best known for housing hippies to hipsters throughout the decades. Our family home is about equidistant between the Kentucky Fried Chicken world headquarters and Colonel Sanders’ grave.” Growing up, Yurt went to Saint Xavier High School, where one of his fellow students was Tommy Mapother (perhaps better known to the world at large as Tom Cruise). He credits his parents for giving him the travel bug during these formative years: “I can still remember sitting in the family car at age 10 and seeing the skyline of New York City for the first time. The feeling that one day I wanted to live in a big city with big skyscrapers like NYC has; little did I know that that city, decades later, would end up being Kuala Lumpur.” After years of working for large corporations such as Ford Motor Company and JP Morgan Chase, Yurt found himself getting retrenched as the 2008 financial crisis lurked around the corner. He recalls, “I decided to expand my job search internationally. Within weeks I had been put in touch with a Malaysian woman who was running an English school in Kuala Lumpur. Two weeks after that I was offered, and accepted a teaching position here.” Throughout his life, Yurt had always been fascinated with Asian culture therefore his move to Malaysia, mere months after the 2008 Beijing Olympics, felt like perfect timing. Besides teaching students for the first time (teaching being a childhood dream), he also made full use of the opportunity to travel around Malaysia and South-east Asia. According to Yurt, his Malaysian friends would tease him about how he is more Malaysian than they are. He says, “They tell me I have been to more places in Malaysia than they have and participate in more cultural events here than they do. Malaysia fits me like a glove and I have fallen in love with Malaysian food (as my waistline will attest). I truly, truly love it here — Malaysia is home for me.” Yurt’s travel adventures became fodder for his books, which delve deep into experiences with the places he has been and the people he has encountered. He says, “When I write about an event like Thaipusam, where I get incredibly, emotionally moved by who and what I am surrounded by, I can’t help but try my best to give my readers a true sense of what I am feeling. The same goes for my experiences at Angkor Wat or the Killing Fields in Cambodia or spending a few incredible days in a 160-million-year-old rainforest that Taman Negara is!” Yurt’s two books, Finding Myself: The Adventures of An American in Malaysia and Finding My World: The Further Adventures of an American in South-east Asia and BeyondOutside of Kuala Lumpur, Yurt’s favourite city is Phnom Penh. He explains, “It’s compact and convenient, and there’s all that beautiful Khmer architecture. More importantly, it’s the Cambodian people and their history that I witnessed in my lifetime, growing up in the States. It really affected me. How these people are so friendly and open despite the horrors of war before.” Beyond sharing travel stories, Yurt hopes to let his “readers know they can take huge chances in their lives; great leaps of faith like I did when I left everyone and everything I had ever loved and moved to Malaysia. And that those great leaps of faith can not only work out, but can give them experiences that they have never even dreamt of!” Looking back at when he made the momentous decision to find a new life in Malaysia, Yurt remembers how family and friends thought he was crazy. “Still, no one stopped me and my parents were very supportive, as they’ve always been. “My advice to others in the same situation would be to ‘Just do it!’ Don’t keep thinking. The worst that could happen is you don’t like the place; you can always go home or move to another city. Find a place that fits your personality, rather than chase the money trail.” While Yurt has found a place where he truly belongs in Malaysia, he feels his Malaysian friends have the opposite problem — the nagging thought that they would be better off starting a new life elsewhere. He explains, “I always tell them, my very good and smart Malaysian friends, ‘Don’t leave. Malaysia needs you.’ The grass isn’t always greener on the other side.” Yurt’s passion may be in travelling and seeing more of the world but he is grateful for finding a real home away from home. He says, “Whether I’m in the States or in Malaysia, it’s great to be in two places where literally millions of people want to come to – to work, to live, to start new lives. I can’t say that about most countries I’ve visited but I can for my homeland and my adopted country. I just wish more Malaysians realised this.” Perhaps making a home for oneself allows one to keep exploring. From “The Little Gidding”, the last of T. S. Eliot’s Four Quartets: “We shall not cease from exploration / And the end of all our exploring / Will be to arrive where we started / And know the place for the first time.” For Yurt, arriving where he first started may not be returning to Kentucky but to his original desire to see more of the world. He has seen, and he will keep exploring, and he will always experience every place with fresh eyes, always for the first time. Yurt’s books are now available at MPH Bookstores.                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Fury over ‘degrading’ Saint Laurent ad campaign Slipping and sliding in 'awfully' tough wife-carrying event (VIDEO) After a partner dies, mourning the loss of sex Breaking the bank: Thai vets remove 915 coins from turtle Works inspired by the memory of Zaha Hadid on show at Design Shanghai Fury over ‘degrading’ Saint Laurent ad campaign Brazilian-Chinese model is Miss Universe Malaysia 2017 Salt x Paper: Bringing beautiful stationery to Sabah Kentucky to Kuala Lumpur: How an American ‘found himself’ in Malaysia Forced smiles mask pain of Hong Kong’s trafficked bar girls Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Reuters Video: ‘Babies’ on board for Beyonce and Jay Z Reuters Video: Obama, Richard Branson go kiteboarding Reuters Video: ‘The White Helmets’ filmmakers discuss ‘Muslim ban’ Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
Skip to content MilTech pr@satprnews.com Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 5 March 2017 by Military News Bank Stock Roundup: Fed Interest Hike Expectation Raise Optimism; JPMorgan, Citi in Focus Shutterstock photo Over the last five trading days, major banks’ rally continued with expectation of another interest rate hike this month. The rate hike will aid top-line expansion for banks, making way for improved results in the quarters ahead. An upsurge in interest income is anticipated for banks and margin pressure is likely to ease further. Further, domestic economic growth will support their financials. Mortgage rates, which were on an upswing, declined this week, hitting 4.10%. In spite of the plunge, investors are apprehensive about parking funds in the housing market, thanks to the volatility in the financial world. However, homeowners seeking lower rates for refinancing are definitely big-time gainers. Meanwhile, banks remained focused on strategies to enhance profitability through restructuring and acquisitions, in the last five trading days. (Read: Bank Stock Roundup for the week ending Feb 24, 2017 ) Important Developments of the Week 1. At the annual Investors Day conference, JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s JPM management discussed the current macroeconomic backdrop and the path the company is taking to enhance profitability over the medium term. In addition, the company provided first-quarter and full-year 2017 guidance. The first and foremost thing that comes to every investor’s mind is the improving rate scenario and how banks will capitalize on the same. JPMorgan is well positioned for raising rates, which will drive its net interest income. Further, JPMorgan intends to invest significantly in its credit card business and become more technologically focused to remain competitive amid growing customer needs. Notably, JPMorgan affirmed its long term-targets of cost-to-revenue ratio of 55% (despite continued investments in franchise), return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of nearly 15% and net payout ratio of 55-75% (read more: What Lies Ahead for JPMorgan Amid Improving Economy? ). 2. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured commercial banks and savings institutions reported fourth-quarter 2016 earnings of $43.7 billion, up 7.7% year over year. Notably, community banks, constituting 93% of all FDIC-insured institutions, reported net income of $5.3 billion, up 10.5% year over year. Banks’ earnings were driven by higher revenues, loan growth and lower loan-loss provisions. Moreover, improved trading revenue remained another positive. On the other hand, expenses flared up (read more: FDIC-Insured Banks: Q4 Earnings Strong, Revenues Escalate ). 3. Following Wells Fargo & Company’s WFC $185-million settlement in Sep 2016 to resolve regulators’ claims of illegally opening millions of unauthorized accounts, the U.S. lender now plans to cut back 2016 cash bonuses for eight top executives and withhold stock awards received in 2014 by 50%. The clawback of bonuses will reduce Wells Fargo’s bonus pay by $32 million. Notably, eight top executives included the new CEO Tim Sloan and CFO John Shrewsberry as well. After the disclosure of malpractices related to the opening of around two million bank and credit card accounts without customers’ consent, Wells Fargo has been facing issues with clients as they are reluctant to conduct business with the lender. Following this scandal, new account openings slumped about 44% (read more: Wells Fargo Slashes Bonus for Executives Post Scandal ). 4.  More than a decade after withdrawing its operations from Saudi Arabia, Citigroup Inc. C is making efforts to re-enter the region. The bank is currently in discussions for acquiring a banking license in Saudi Arabia, as it is trying to capitalize on the country’s financial reforms. Though the company is optimistic about receiving the license, it is apprehensive that the talks could fail at the last stage. Without a license from the Capital Market Authority (CMA) – the regulatory body in Saudi Arabia for applying for full financial, legal, and administrative independence – international banks face hurdles on working on deals signed in the country. (read more: Citigroup in Discussion for Saudi Arabia Banking License ). Price Performance Here is how the seven major stocks performed: Company Last Week 6 months JPM 2.0% 36.5% BAC 4.1% 57.7% WFC 1.6% 16.1% C 1.8% 27.6% COF 1.9% 31.7% USB 0.7% 25.6% PNC 0.5% 40.8% In the last five trading sessions, Bank of America Corp. BAC and JPMorgan were the major gainers with their shares increasing 4.1% and 2.0%, respectively. Moreover, Capital One Financial Corp. COF shares inched up 1.9%. BofA and The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. PNC were the best performers in the last six months, with their shares surging a whopping 57.7% and 40.8%, respectively. Moreover, JPMorgan’s shares jumped 36.5%. What’s Next? In the coming five days, nothing major is likely to occur in the banking space. Unless there is a substantial upheaval in the global markets, bank stocks will continue to perform in a similar fashion.

'If you go into what I call a bubble boom, every bubble bursts.' - Margaret Thatcher Home Articles Authors Search About Us HOME / Articles / Doug Noland / Reality vs. The Neutral Rate Reality vs. The Neutral Rate By: Doug Noland | Sat, Mar 4, 2017 Share Print Email How about a cursory look at recent economic data: February's 57.7 ISM Manufacturing reading was the strongest since August 2014. New Orders at 65.1 matched the strongest level (Dec. 2013) since 2009. Prices Paid at 68 was only slightly below January's 69, the strongest since 2011. February's ISM Non-Manufacturing Index rose to 57.6, the highest since October 2015 (58.1). Auto sales in February were just below record levels. Last week's Initial jobless claims (223,000) were the lowest since March 1973. Weekly mortgage purchase applications bounced back to near seven-year highs. Trade deficits are running at the widest level since before the crisis. The PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure) Deflator was up 0.4% in January, increasing y-o-y gains to 1.9%. This matched the highest y-o-y reading in almost five years. Core PCE was up 0.3% for the month, pushing y-o-y gains to 1.7%. The Conference Board's February Consumer Confidence reading rose to the highest level since July 2001. At 133.4, the Conference Board Present Situation index jumped to the high since July 2007 - and is now only five points away from a 15-year high. Personal Income added 0.4% in January, increasing y-o-y income growth to 4.0%. After incredible 2016 inflows of $305 billion, Vanguard has attracted flows of $80 billion in just the first two months of the year. March 3 - Wall Street Journal (Asjylyn Loder): "Investors poured $62.9 billion into exchange-traded funds in February, pushing the year-to-date world-wide tally to $124 billion, the fastest start of any year in the history of the ETF industry, according to... BlackRock Inc. U.S. ETFs accounted for $44 billion of that, pushing assets in U.S. funds to almost $2.8 trillion. Most of the money went to cheap, index-tracking ETFs..." February 28 - Bloomberg (Sid Verma and Oliver Renick): "You can thank the little guy for Dow 20,000. That's the takeaway from data tracking money flows into and out of stocks, according to... JPMorgan... The telltale sign retail investors are behind the longest string of U.S. stock highs in decades? An $83 billion surge of cash into passive strategies so far this year amid a $15 billion withdrawal from actively managed funds. That's on top of evidence that institutional traders have backed away, the bank says." March 3 - Bloomberg (George Caliendo and Michael Hyler): "U.S. investment grade corporate bond sales totaled more than $281 billion in the first two months of the year, the most in at least 10 years. Exxon Mobil Corp is among the companies that could keep issuance at a record pace in the first quarter of 2017." They've really gone and done it this time. The Fed had cut rates from 8.25% in 1990 to a cycle low 3.0% in September 1992. Ignoring a policy-induced speculative bubble inflating throughout the bond and mortgage derivatives markets, the Greenspan Fed waited to begin normalizing rates until February 1994. In 2001, Fed funds began the year at 6.50% and were then slashed to only 1.00% by June 2003. The Fed didn't take its first baby-step increase until June 2004, after several years of double-digit mortgage Credit growth and a mortgage finance Bubble that had gathered powerful momentum. The current remarkable cycle has brought new meaning to the phrase "Behind the Curve." Rates were cut from 5.25% starting back in September 2007. By December 2008 they had been slashed to zero (to 25bps), with the DJIA ending the year at 8,876. Now, with the DJIA at 21,000, Fed funds sit today at only 0.75%. Rates have budged little off zero despite record securities prices, record corporate bond issuance, record home prices and a 4.8% unemployment rate. While Q4 data will be out soon, it appears that 2016 posted the largest Credit growth since 2007. Through the first three quarters of 2016, non-financial Credit expanded at an annualized pace of just under $2.4 TN, not far off 2007's record $2.503 TN. For comparison, non-financial debt expanded $1.259 TN in '09, $1.589 TN in '10, $1.309 TN in '11, $1.916 TN in '12, $1.545 TN in '13, $1.807 TN in '14 and $1.931 TN in '15. The strongest Credit expansion in years is led by robust growth in consumer Credit, corporate debt and federal borrowings. Even mortgage Credit has picked up to the fastest pace since 2007, after years in the doldrums. In my parlance, years of accelerating Credit expansion have engendered self-reinforcing inflationary biases throughout the economy, most notably in securities, real estate and asset prices more generally. Increasingly, however, rising incomes have begun fueling some inflationary pressure even in the traditional consumer price arena. U.S. Credit growth and economic activity had attained sufficient self-sustaining momentum by 2014 and 2015 for the Fed to have launched so-called "normalization." It was a major policy blunder not to have this process well underway by 2016. The Fed basically disregarded domestic considerations as it postponed rate adjustments after the single December 2015 baby-step. The faltering Chinese Bubble from a year ago held sway, not only with respect to Fed policy but for the ECB and BOJ as well. A Chinese bust clearly had major ramifications for the global inflationary backdrop. Yet there's always that thin line between a bursting Bubble and the acquiescence of irrepressible "Terminal Phase" excess. As it turned out, rather than a disinflationary shock catalyst for a susceptible world, China's aggressive reflationary measures ensured record 2016 Credit expansion and attendant upside inflationary pressures at home and abroad. China historic Credit Bubble is ongoing, and it's pulling global inflationary dynamics along for the ride. From the conclusion of Yellen's Friday Afternoon speech - "From Adding Accommodation to Scaling It Back:" "We [support continued growth... in pursuit of our... mandates], as I have noted, with an eye always on the risks. To that end, we realize that waiting too long to scale back some of our support could potentially require us to raise rates rapidly sometime down the road, which in turn could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into recession. Having said that, I currently see no evidence that the Federal Reserve has fallen behind the curve, and I therefore continue to have confidence in our judgment that a gradual removal of accommodation is likely to be appropriate." Of course chair Yellen is not about to conceded that the Fed has fallen "Behind the Curve." Her speech, however, was heavy on rationalizing and justifying why the FOMC has been incredibly reluctant to begin normalizing policy. "Gauging the current stance of monetary policy requires arriving at a judgment of what would constitute a neutral policy stance at a given time. A useful concept in this regard is the neutral 'real' federal funds rate, defined as the level of the federal funds rate that, when adjusted for inflation, is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its potential. In effect, a 'neutral' policy stance is one where monetary policy neither has its foot on the brake nor is pressing down on the accelerator..." "In the Committee's most recent projections last December, most FOMC participants assessed the longer-run value of the neutral real federal funds rate to be in the vicinity of 1%..." "It is difficult to say just how low the current neutral rate is because assessments of the effect of post-recession headwinds on the current level of the neutral real rate are subject to a great deal of uncertainty. Some recent estimates of the current value of the neutral real federal funds rate stand close to zero percent..." "In 2015, the unemployment rate fell significantly faster than we generally had anticipated in 2014. However, a series of unanticipated global developments beginning in the second half of 2014--including a prolonged decline in oil prices, a sizable appreciation of the dollar, and financial market turbulence emanating from abroad--ended up having adverse implications for the outlook for inflation and economic activity in the United States, prompting the FOMC to remove monetary policy accommodation at a slower pace than we had anticipated in mid-2014..." Future historians will be unimpressed with the Fed's whole line of "neutral rate" analysis. It's certainly reminiscent of chairman Greenspan's late-nineties foray into the New Economy's "faster speed limit" -- as rationalization for evading the tough action necessary to rein in excessively loose monetary conditions and resulting speculative asset markets. Yellen presented a reasonably comprehensive analysis of Fed thinking, yet her Friday speech does not include the either the word "Credit" or "money." Regrettably, it's the same flawed theoretical framework that has gotten the Fed - and the rest of us - in repeated trouble for the past three decades. Ten-year bond yields were 5.6% when the Fed moved to tighten policy in February 1994. Yields then shot all the way to 8.0% into early November. The Fed took from that experience the notion that it must clearly signal to the markets that rate increases will be gradual and quite measured. This fundamentally altered how the bond market responds to Fed policy changes. Indeed, a case can be made that since '94 the Fed has avoided measures that would actually tighten financial conditions. Ten-year yields were at 4.7% when the Fed initiated tightening measures (at 1.25%) in May 2004, before ending the year at 4.2%. Fed funds were up to 5.25% by June '06, though 10-year bond yields had increased to just over 5%. Bond yields then began 2007 at 4.7%, market rates sufficiently low to ensure quite loose financial conditions and prolong the dangerous Bubble. Ten-year yields closed Friday trading at 2.48%. Clearly, the bond market has little fear of Fed tightening measures. At this point, the backdrop is showing similarities to the 2004-2007 Bubble period where Fed rate increases couldn't keep up with rising inflationary biases - in securities and asset prices, as well as throughout the real economy. The Fed's focus on some abstract "neutral rate" is foolhardy central banking, especially when it comes at the expense of analysis of Credit and monetary factors. For a central bank supposedly "data dependent", how are the markets to gauge and interpret such a nebulous theoretical concept (other than as rationalization for disregarding asset inflation and bubbles)? What was the "neutral rate" one year ago, with China in trouble, global markets faltering, crude at about $40 and CPI measures pointing downward? How about today, with record global Credit growth, booming markets, crude at $53 and CPI trends pointing almost straight up? The ISM Prices Paid index was 33.5 in January 2016 - the low since 2009. By January 2017 it had more than doubled to 69, the highest in almost six years. "Neutral rate" has no practical policy relevance in a period of such monetary and price disorder. The Fed surely hopes to offload some of their tightening work to the financial markets. So far, ebullient markets seem rather determined to sustain ultra-loose financial conditions. If inflationary forces have finally gathered self-reinforcing momentum, dillydallying several years to get Fed funds up to three or four percent is not going to cut it. It seems obvious that the Fed has fallen way Behind the Curve. And this may be irrelevant to markets currently, though this phase will pass. It's sure disconcerting to see the public throw "money" at equity index products at this stage of the market cycle. The Fed has cultivated the misperception that it's a whole lot safer than buying Bubble technology stocks in 1999 or Bubble equities and houses in 2007.   For the Week: The S&P500 gained 0.7% (up 6.4% y-t-d), and the Dow increased 0.9% (up 6.3%).

Trump Administration Watch: February 27 - Politico (Rachael Bade, Sarah Ferris and Shane Goldmacher): "Congressional Republicans... panned Donald Trump's call to finance a military buildup by slashing domestic agencies and ignoring entitlement programs — undermining the president's budget even before it's been finalized. The consternation spanned the party's ranks just one day before Trump addresses Congress for his first time Tuesday evening: House GOP fiscal hawks said it was ludicrous to think they'd pass a budget that did not address ballooning costs in Medicare and Social Security, the main drivers of the national debt. Pragmatic-minded GOP appropriators scratched their heads over where Trump would siphon off $54 billion in domestic cuts. And GOP defense hawks said the Pentagon budget boost doesn't go nearly far enough." February 28 - Wall Street Journal (Michael C. Bender): "One day after his budget team promised dollar-for-dollar cuts to offset a request for more military spending, President Donald Trump said... the additional money he is seeking for the defense budget would be paid for by a surge in tax collections sparked by the improving economy. 'The money is going to come from a revved-up economy,' Mr. Trump said... 'I mean, you look at the kind of numbers we're doing, we were probably GDP of a little more than 1%. And if I can get that up to three, maybe more, we have a whole different ballgame." March 1 - Bloomberg (Andrew Mayeda): "The U.S. isn't bound by decisions made at the World Trade Organization, President Donald Trump's administration said in outlining a new trade agenda that promises to root out unfair practices by foreign countries. America plans to defend its 'national sovereignty over trade policy,' the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said in an annual document laying out the president's trade agenda. Under the terms of its entry into the WTO, the U.S. didn't abandon its trade rights, according to the document, obtained by Bloomberg News and titled '2017 Trade Policy Agenda.'" China Bubble Watch: March 1 - Bloomberg: "China's banking regulator outlined wide-ranging efforts to rein in financial risks, including clamping down on shadow lending and curbing funding for property speculation. Guo Shuqing, three days on the job as chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, said he will coordinate with other financial authorities, including the central bank, to plug loopholes in regulations for cross-market financial products and update rules that no longer fit with banks' current business and risk management. 'Banks, trusts, fund-management firms, brokerages and insurers all have asset-management operations, but because they have different regulators and are subject to different rules, there's been some chaos,' Guo said..." February 28 - Reuters (Kevin Yao): "China plans to target broad money supply growth of around 12% in 2017, slightly lower than last year's goal, policy sources said, signaling a bid to contain debt risks while keeping growth on track. Under its new 'prudent and neutral' policy, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has adopted a modest tightening bias in a bid to cool torrid credit expansion, though it is treading cautiously to avoid hurting the economy. The M2 growth target was endorsed by leaders at the closed-door Central Economic Work Conference in December..." February 25 - Reuters (Shu Zhang and Matthew Miller): "Guo Shuqing, who is stepping down as governor of Shandong province to take control of China's banking regulator, returns to Beijing at a decisive moment for the country's financial system following years of breakneck economic growth. The immediate challenge for the new chairman of the ChinaBanking Regulatory Commission (CRBC) is formidable - Guo must vigorously address troubled lending in the country's 232 trillion yuan ($34 trillion) banking sector and implement tougher measures to control lightly regulated shadow banking activities." February 26 - Reuters: "China will focus on stable development of its capital markets this year, but will press ahead to further open its markets to foreign companies, the top securities regulator said... 'We will not waver from reforms (to make China's capital markets) more market-based, law-based and international,' Liu Shiyu, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), told a news conference... Chinese regulators have turned their sights on controlling risks in financial markets as speculative activity and leverage in the economy rise, with the securities regulator vowing to clear out "abnormal phenomena" from capital markets. The CSRC recently pledged to target 'barbaric' leveraged buyouts and to restrict excessive fundraising by some listed companies, with a focus on private share placements." March 2 - New York Times (Sui-Lee Wee): "Mao once branded capitalists enemies of the Chinese people. In the era of President Xi Jinping, those capitalists are billionaire lawmakers — and they're getting even wealthier. The combined fortune of the wealthiest members of China's Parliament and its advisory body amounts to $500 billion, just below the annual economic output of Sweden. Among that group of 209 entrepreneurs and business tycoons, the 100 richest saw their net worth rise 64% in the four years since Mr. Xi took power..." February 27 - Financial Times (Jennifer Hughes and Don Weinland): "Chinese companies have borrowed more money from the international bond market than from domestic investors so far this year, breaking with tradition as authorities in Beijing focus on curbing capital outflows. Banks and other corporate borrowers have been quietly encouraged to raise money offshore in other currencies, limiting the need for Chinese companies to sell renminbi to finance overseas investments. Borrowing more outside the mainland also allows for the possibility companies will remit some of the cash back home, bolstering the Chinese currency in the process. Led by banks and property developers, corporate China has raised $26.1bn from offshore bond sales compared with $21bn at home, according to Dealogic." March 2 - Reuters (Elias Glenn): "China's factory activity expanded for the eighth straight month in February as export orders picked up, a private survey showed..., giving authorities more room to tackle financial risks in the economy as debt continues to rise.

February 28 - Wall Street Journal (Jacky Wong): "China's housing-market party is winding down for now, and the country's biggest developer could have a painful hangover. China Evergrande Group, the poster child for an overleveraged industry, proved again its debt-fueled ambitions haven't yet been reached. According to a filing Tuesday, total borrowings have risen to 565 billion yuan ($82.2bn) as of mid-January, a 48% increase from its June level. Netted out of cash, Evergrande is the most indebted real-estate company globally... The developer, which also owns a soccer club and a plastic-surgery hospital, intends to raise 30 billion yuan by selling stakes in its major subsidiary." February 27 - Financial Times (Tom Hancock): "Bankruptcy cases surged in China last year, indicating growing economic stress as well as progress in the ruling Communist party's efforts to use the country's courts to deal with indebted 'zombie' companies and reduce industrial overcapacity. Chinese courts accepted 5,665 bankruptcy cases in 2016, an increase of 54% from the year before... About 3,600 of those cases were resolved, with 85% of the resolved cases resulting in liquidation. 'It is linked to getting rid of zombie companies and making the economy more efficient,' said Susan Finder, law scholar in residence at Peking University's Shenzhen Graduate School." February 27 - Financial Times (Don Weinland): "Has China's crackdown on capital flight claimed its biggest name to date? The fate of a $1bn deal struck in November by Dalian Wanda, the Chinese real estate and entertainment giant, is in doubt. People with knowledge of Wanda's buyout of the US's Dick Clark Productions, the company behind the Golden Globe Awards, said last week that it was struggling to get approval to move money offshore, putting the transaction at risk. Wanda's deal could survive if approvals come in time, people close to the matter said. But the delay highlights a shift in Beijing's economic priorities." Global Bubble Watch: March 1 - Reuters (Saikat Chatterjee): "Asian factories extended a global manufacturing revival as activity picked up steam in February... Manufacturing surveys for Asia, including for its two biggest economies China and Japan, showed a broadly positive impulse for exports in a welcome sign for many of the companies tapped into the global supply chain. 'Encouragingly, the data indicated that the current upturn in demand remains broad-based across both domestic and international markets, while a further steep increase in purchasing activity raises the prospect of continued production growth in coming months,' said Annabel Fiddes, economist at IHS Markit..." February 28 - Bloomberg (Simon Ballard): "The moment of truth for debt markets beckons. Given the extent to which monetary stimulus in Europe has helped to compress corporate bond spreads and flatten the credit curve, fears may grow over the coming months as to how investors will react to the end of the monetary backstop bid. That will depend on the speed of any reversal. The Bank of England bought 7.4 billion pounds ($9.2 billion) of corporate bonds in the five months through Feb. 22." March 3 - Bloomberg (Katia Dmitrieva): "Toronto home prices jumped more than 20% in February for the sixth straight month as listings dried up, pushing the price of a suburban house beyond C$1 million ($750,000) for the first time, according to the city's real estate board. The average home in Canada's biggest city... climbed 28% to C$875,983 last month from the prior year as active listings were cut in half to 5,400." March 1 - Bloomberg (Emily Cadman): "Dwelling values in Australia's largest city rose at the fastest annual pace in 14-years in February as record-low interest rates outweighed regulatory efforts to avert a housing bubble.

'There must not be a bail-in,' Jens Spahn told German broadcaster Deutschlandfunk... 'We think it is very, very likely that we will come to an agreement with the International Monetary Fund that does not require a haircut,' he said, referring to losses that Greece's creditors would have to take if debt was written off." Europe Watch: March 2 - Bloomberg (Maria Tadeo and Lorenzo Totaro): "Euro-area inflation accelerated to the fastest pace since January 2013, providing fresh arguments to those calling for an exit from the European Central Bank's monetary stimulus program. Consumer prices rose 2% in February from a year earlier... In a sign of further increases ahead, producer-price growth jumped to the highest in almost five years, rising 3.5% in January on annual basis..." March 1 - Reuters (Balazs Koranyi): "Euro zone inflation is likely to be sharply higher in 2017 than projected but will still dip towards the end of the year, Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann said..., arguing that accommodative monetary policy remains appropriate. With inflation surging on higher oil prices, and criticism of the European Central Bank (ECB) mounting in Germany ahead of September's elections, pressure has increased on the ECB to at least start a discussion about when and how it would scale back its extraordinary stimulus measures... Weidmann stopped short of calling for any particular measures but argued that keeping borrowing costs low for too long risked getting budgets addicted to cheap cash, making eventual tightening even harder. 'Monetary policy has to avoid the markets' perception that the central bank is only willing to counter downward pressure on financial markets with an accommodative policy stance but refrains from tightening the reins in times of higher price stability risks due to the fear of triggering market turbulences,' he said." March 1 - Reuters (Michael Nienaber): "German inflation, a politically- and emotionally-charged issue for consumers heading for the polls later this year, soared to its highest level in four-and-a-half years in February, bounding past the European Central Bank's euro zone target. Manufacturing was also reported as growing at the strongest rate since 2011, in a further sign that Europe's biggest economy is firing on all cylinders. The inflation data nonetheless triggered fresh calls from Germany for an end to the ECB's loose monetary policy, particularly with the federal election set for September." March 1 - Bloomberg (Alessandro Speciale): "Euro-area manufacturing accelerated for a sixth month in February amid signs that inflation pressures may be starting to build as factories struggle to keep up with demand. A Purchasing Managers' Index climbed to 55.4, IHS Markit said... Companies raised output charges at the fastest pace in more than five years as higher commodity prices and a weaker euro drove up costs, while suppliers took longer to fill orders..." February 28 - Bloomberg (Stefania Spezzati): "France's bonds may suffer the most if there is a greater-than-expected populist election victory in Netherlands in March, one month before the country's own presidential vote. The French securities have recovered in February after falling in recent months, as anti-euro candidate Marine Le Pen leads polls for a first round in April but is seeing fading momentum in surveys for a second-round runoff in May. The anti-EU Dutch Freedom Party, or PVV, is forecast in polls to become the largest in parliament and a big victory would again unsettle nerves among investors in euro-area government bonds." Federal Reserve Watch: February 28 - Reuters (Ann Saphir and Jonathan Spicer): "A handful of Federal Reserve policymakers on Tuesday jolted markets into higher expectations for a March U.S. interest rate increase, with comments that suggested rate-setters are worried about waiting too long in the face of pending economic stimulus... New York Fed President William Dudley, among the most influential U.S. central bankers, said on CNN that the case for tightening monetary policy 'has become a lot more compelling' since the election of President Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress. John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, said that with the economy at full employment, inflation headed higher, and upside risks from potential tax cuts waiting in the wings, 'I personally don't see any need to delay' raising rates. 'In my view, a rate increase is very much on the table for serious consideration at our March meeting.'" February 28 - Wall Street Journal (Ben Leubsdorf): "U.S. inflation is closing in on the Federal Reserve's long elusive 2% annual target, the latest evidence of firming price pressures that could bolster the case for the central bank to raise short-term interest rates as soon as this month. The personal-consumption-expenditures price index, which is the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.4% in January from the prior month and climbed 1.9% from a year earlier... Excluding the often volatile categories of food and energy, prices rose 0.3% from December and 1.7% compared with January 2016." March 1 - Bloomberg (Christopher Condon and Matthew Boesler): "One of the Federal Reserve's biggest skeptics about the strength of the global expansion signaled the U.S. economy may be strong enough to withstand an interest-rate increase soon, as key policy makers coalesce around tightening at their next meeting in mid-March. 'Assuming continued progress, it will likely be appropriate soon to remove additional accommodation, continuing on a gradual path,' Fed Governor Lael Brainard said... 'We are closing in on full employment, inflation is moving gradually toward our target, foreign growth is on more solid footing and risks to the outlook are as close to balanced as they have been in some time.'" U.S. Bubble Watch: March 1 - CNBC (Jeff Cox): "Forget the dot-com boom with its 'irrational exuberance' and the real estate bubble that was supposed to be invincible: Current market sentiment eclipses all of that. In fact, bullishness has never been this high going all the way back to 1987. That's through three rousing bull markets, a couple of crashes, the 'Great Moderation' of the 1990s and all sorts of other history-making events. A market that was supposed to flounder this year under a new president instead has taken off, and investors are pumped. Bullishness is at 63.1% of market professionals responding to the latest Investors Intelligence survey. That's the highest level since the year of the infamous 'Black Monday' Oct. 19, 1987, crash that sent the U.S. market down nearly 23% in one day." March 2 - Financial Times (Robin Wigglesworth): "The number of US exchange traded funds has passed the 2,000 mark, as providers churn out an array of increasingly esoteric products that target investment 'themes' from evangelical values to entrepreneurship and marijuana — with a Trump ETF possibly waiting in the wings.

March 1 - Financial Times (Robin Wigglesworth): "President Donald Trump wants corporate America to invest more in factories, but since the financial crisis more companies have preferred to hoover up their own shares. Yet have buybacks provided bang for their buck? There have been many critics of the recent corporate buyback bonanza, with figures from former US vice-president Joe Biden to BlackRock founder Larry Fink contending companies have eschewed growth-boosting investments in favour of short-term share repurchases, increasingly financing them with cheap debt rather than earnings. But perhaps the most notable thing about the buyback spree — more than $2tn of shares have been repurchased in the past five years — is how it has arguably provided only a modest boost to equity prices, at least compared to the scale of the purchases."

Total loans and leases by U.S. commercial banks are currently rising at an annual pace of about 5%, based on weekly seasonally adjusted data from the Federal Reserve. That is down from a 6.4% pace for all of last year and peak rates of around 8% in mid-2016. The deceleration has been broad-based across business, real estate and consumer lending and is at odds with the idea of a stronger economy and rising sentiment. The slowdown has been particularly stark in commercial and industrial lending, which was growing at around 10% in the first half of last year, but is now up just 5.7% from a year earlier." February 28 - Bloomberg (Gabrielle Coppola): "For the first time in his 37 years working at New Jersey car dealerships, Larry Kull had to rent extra space to store unsold new Honda vehicles -- one of the latest signs that the record U.S. auto market is cooling.

His argument: Stocks are very overbought and sentiment is way too bullish for the so-called Trump rally to continue. 'Very simply, the market starts to go down. As it goes down, it will start triggering selling, and then it will be like an avalanche,' said Faber recently on 'Futures Now.' 'I would underweight U.S. stocks.'" Japan Watch: February 28 - Financial Times (Robin Harding and Elaine Moore): "The Bank of Japan published detailed schedules of planned asset purchases for the first time on Tuesday as it seeks to prove its commitment to a zero per cent cap on 10-year government bond yields. Japan's central bank said it will buy a minimum of ¥1.375tn and a maximum of ¥2.175tn of government bonds during March... Setting out the purchase plan in advance makes it less likely that the BoJ will skip an auction — a common subject of market speculation as the central bank accumulates an ever larger share of outstanding government bonds through its programme of monetary easing."

February 25 - Reuters (Ben Blanchard and Michael Martina): "The PLA Navy is likely to secure significant new funding in China's upcoming defense budget as Beijing seeks to check U.S. dominance of the high seas and step up its own projection of power around the globe... Now, with President Donald Trump promising a U.S. shipbuilding spree and unnerving Beijing with his unpredictable approach on hot button issues including Taiwan and the South and East China Seas, China is pushing to narrow the gap with the U.S. Navy. 'It's opportunity in crisis,' said a Beijing-based Asian diplomat, of China's recent naval moves. 'China fears Trump will turn on them eventually as he's so unpredictable and it's getting ready."     Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. Author: Doug Noland Doug Noland Credit Bubble Bulletin I just wrapped up 25 years (persevering) as a "professional bear." My lucky break came in late-1989, when I was hired by Gordon Ringoen to be the trader for his short-biased hedge fund in San Francisco. Working as a short-side trader, analyst and portfolio manager during the great nineties bull market - for one of the most brilliant individuals I've met - was an exciting, demanding and, in the end, a grueling and absolutely invaluable learning experience. Later in the nineties, I had stints at Fleckenstein Capital and East Shore Partners. In January 1999, I began my 16 year run with PrudentBear, working as strategist and portfolio manager with David Tice in Dallas until the bear funds were sold in December 2008. In the early-nineties, I became an impassioned reader of The Richebacher Letter. The great Dr. Richebacher opened my eyes to Austrian economics and solidified my lifetime passion for economics and macro analysis. I had the good fortune to assist Dr. Richebacher with his publication from 1996 through 2001. Prior to my work in investments, I worked as a treasury analyst at Toyota's U.S. headquarters. It was working at Toyota during the Japanese Bubble period and the 1987 stock market crash where I first recognized my love for macro analysis. Fresh out of college I worked as a Price Waterhouse CPA. I graduated summa cum laude from the University of Oregon (Accounting and Finance majors, 1984) and later received an MBA from Indiana University (1989). By late in the nineties, I was convinced that momentous developments were unfolding in finance, the markets and policymaking that were going unrecognized by conventional analysis and the media. I was inspired to start my blog, which became the Credit Bubble Bulletin, by the desire to shed light on these developments. I believe there is great value in contemporaneous analysis, and I'll point to Benjamin Anderson's brilliant writings in the "Chase Economic Bulletin" during the Roaring Twenties and Great Depression era. Ben Bernanke has referred to understanding the forces leading up to the Great Depression as the "Holy Grail of Economics." I believe "The Grail" will instead be discovered through knowledge and understanding of the current extraordinary global Bubble period.

 7 questions to make sure your financial adviser is on your side, according to the one who helped Tony Robbins write his second book about money Richard Feloni Mar. 4, 2017, 11:16 AM 7,376 facebook linkedin twitter email print Performance coach Tony Robbins. Sarah Jacobs Tony Robbins became the world's most famous performance coach through decades of energetic seminars and high-profile clients, but he's made spreading personal finance knowledge his mission the past couple years. Around 2010, Robbins began speaking with what would become 50 of the United States' top financial minds, including his longtime client Paul Tudor Jones, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio, Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, and JP Morgan Asset Management CEO Mary Callahan Erdoes. One of the recurring themes he found is that the American public — even those who had accumulated a degree of wealth — needed to become better educated about their relationship to financial advisers, and how they could avoid losing thousands of dollars in the longterm. Robbins recently came by Business Insider's New York office for a Facebook Live Q&A where he discussed his latest book based on these interviews, "Unshakeable," a much slimmer version of his 2014 book "Money: Master the Game," with additional insights from Peter Mallouk, who was rated the No. 1 wealth adviser in the US by Barron's three times, and who brought Robbins into his firm Creative Planning in 2016. "If you're watching right now, there's a new word you've got to learn. It's an F word: Fiduciary," Robbins told the audience. He explained that it's crucial to understand the difference between brokers, who will prioritize the interests of their firm, and fiduciaries, who are legally obligated to prioritize their client's interests. It's especially important to know, especially since a proposed fiduciary rule that would require all financial advisers to be fiduciaries looks like it will not pass under the Trump administration. Robbins pointed to seven questions in "Unshakeable" — developed with the help of Mallouk — that everyone needs to ask their financial adviser, whether they're looking to manage a few thousand dollars or significant wealth. 1. 'Are you a registered investment advisor?' Registered investment advisors (RIAs) are fiduciaries, as opposed to brokers. Opponents to a fiduciary rule becoming law, like President Donald Trump's chief economic adviser Gary Cohn, find it to be an unnecessary restriction on how advisers can serve their clients, who may want to invest in higher-risk funds. But regardless of your approach or politics, you need to know who you're dealing with. 2. 'Are you or your firm affiliated with a broker-dealer? There are approximately 310,000 financial advisers in the US, and about 10% of them are RIAs. "Unfortunately, I uncovered a gray part of the law," Robbins said. "And of the 31,000 people that are RIAs, literally 26,000 of them, so the vast majority, are what we call dually registered. That means they're a broker and they're an RIA." To see if your adviser can switch hats, Robbins recommends looking at the adviser's website and seeing if there's a sentence like, "Securities offered through [adviser's company name], member FINRA [Financial Industry Regulatory Authority] and SIPC [Securities Investor Protection Corporation]." 3. 'Does your firm offer proprietary mutual funds or separately managed accounts?' "You want the answer to be an emphatic no," Robbins writes of the two products, which are less transparent and potentially more expensive than a typical mutual fund.  "It probably means they're looking to generate additional revenues by steering you into these products that are highly profitable for them (but probably not for you)." In a conversation with Mallouk recorded last year, Mallouk noted that it becomes an easy choice to offer your firm's proprietary mutual funds to your clients when you'll be getting an extra commission, especially when you know the people managing those funds. Separately managed accounts are alternatives to mutual funds for wealthy individuals, and they do not come with prospectuses, meaning clients need to perform their own due diligence. If you're not a sophisticated investor who specifically wants this approach, you're better off steering clear.  4. 'Do you or your firm receive any third-party compensation for recommending particular investments?' "This is the ultimate question you want answered," Robbins writes. "Because you need to know that your advisor has no incentive to recommend products that will shower him or her with commissions, kickbacks, consulting fees, trips, or other goodies." 5. 'What's your philosophy when it comes to investing?' Robbins and Mallouk recommend avoiding high-risk investments for the average investor, but however you want to invest your money, you need to understand how it's being invested. 6. 'What financial planning services do you offer beyond investment strategy and portfolio management?' You may only need investment help at your particular stage in life, but you should consider where you want to be headed. "Ideally you want an advisor who can bring tools for tax efficiency in all aspects of your planning — from your investment planning to your business planning to your estate planning," Robbins writes. 7. 'Where will my money be held?' "A fiduciary advisor should always use a third-party custodian [like Fidelity or Schwab] to hold your funds," Robbins writes. "You then sign a limited power of attorney that gives the advisor the right to manage the money but never to make withdrawals." This allows you to switch advisers whenever you'd like without having to move your accounts — and it also helps you keep from falling victim to a con man!

The city of Spokane Valley filed a lawsuit on March 1, 2017 against JP Morgan Chase Bank over this nuisance property at 11112 E. 17th Ave. (Pia Hallenberg / The Spokesman-Review) By Pia Hallenberg piah@spokesman.com(509) 459-5427 Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS View full map Neighbors are drawing a sigh of relief after squatters were evicted from a nuisance property at 11112 E. 17th Ave. in Spokane Valley. The rancher has been without power for some time and had broken cars and trash piled in a front yard covered in dog feces. The city of Spokane Valley is now suing JP Morgan Chase Bank, and the unnamed occupants of the property, trying to recoup some of its expenses. “The bank foreclosed on the property within the last couple of months,” said Erik Lamb, Spokane Valley deputy city attorney. “There are limitations under the law as to how the bank can get even squatters out – it can be a lengthy process.” Lamb said squatters were evicted Wednesday because the home was unsafe and unfit for human occupancy, as power and gas to the property had been turned off. Neighbors said squatters burned trash and parts of the interior of the home in the fireplace, and that vehicles were constantly coming and going. Over the years, neighbors made countless calls to authorities and some said they are relieved to see the home boarded up and empty. One neighbor said the home’s residents stole power from her using an extension cord. Lamb said another property in the neighborhood, at 11414 E. 16th Ave., is being cleaned up, too. “That one is a little different as initially we had an order to clean up all the junk around the property,” Lamb said. “But now it has no power and no gas, so it’s unsafe for human occupancy.” Zombie properties – homes that were foreclosed on and are now owned by holding companies and banks located in other states – often fall into disrepair. Lamb said it can be a challenge to find out who exactly owns a ghost property, but this one wasn’t too difficult. “It’s a nice neighborhood. We hope something can get into it and clean it up,” Lamb said. “Though it will probably take a lot of time and money to get it to where you can live there.” Updated: March 4, 2017, 9:36 a.m.  Tags: Erik Lamb, ghost property, JP Morgan Chase Bank, nuisance, Spokane Valley, zombie property Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Print edition home delivery Newspaper Routes Available Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Masthead Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

UNT finance senior leads presentation to regents By Jenna Duncan Jenna Duncan Denton Record-Chronicle Staff Writer jduncan@dentonrc.com Published: 03 March 2017 11:31 PM To finance seven ongoing construction projects across the University of North Texas System, officials had to sell bonds in January to pay for the work. In addition to the regular finance team, James Verfurth, a senior finance major, accompanied the team for a two-day trip to New York to work with financial service companies JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays to sell $264.1 million worth of bonds. Over two days, Verfurth sat in meetings with UNT and bank officials, watched the bonds go to market and met with a variety of executives at both companies. “It was an eye-opening experience,” Verfurth said of the early January trip. “I genuinely enjoy finance and it was an opportunity I couldn’t pass up — I observed something that directly impacts students.” After, he gave a presentation about the experience and bond sales to the Board of Regents last week in Dallas. Over the course of eight minutes, Verfurth explained the sale of new bonds and refinancing of others, totaling $264.1 million. With refinancing, the system saves $7.1 million and reduces the average debt service the system has to pay. “We definitely entered at a good time and it was a favorable entry point for us into the market,” he told the board. “That gave us a phenomenal focus, and we were definitely center stage and center of attention, as far as what institutions and investors were looking at.” Board members whispered among themselves during his presentation. Neal Smatresk, UNT president, turned back from his seat to Luke Lybrand, the UNT System treasury manager who introduced Verfurth, to tell him, “Good job.” At the end of his presentation, board President Brint Ryan asked if Verfurth was sure he wanted to move to Philadelphia for a job with Wells Fargo in June. After the meeting, Ryan, who has been on the board since 2009, said he had never seen a student give this level of presentation to the board before. “I was very impressed with James’ presentation,” he said in an email. “I’ve never seen a student present to the board at this level and I would have hired him on the spot — if he wasn’t already headed to Wells Fargo.” JENNA DUNCAN can be reached at 940-566-6889 and via Twitter at @JennaFDuncan.

Medical expenses are a burden whenever they hit, but a recent study found they’re most common around the first few months of the year. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File) Medical expenses are a burden whenever they hit, but a recent study found they're most common around this time of year. The study found that one in six families makes a major medical payment in any given year, and they tended to occur in the first few months of the year. The study found the median payment was $1,143 and most households take more than a year to recover from the hit. Although the reason for the timing is unclear, researchers at economic think tank JP Morgan Chase Institute who conducted the study hypothesize that people are either putting off treatment or bill paying until tax refund time when they can afford it, or simply facing a fresh new set of deductibles and other out-of-pocket insurance expenses to meet for the year. We gathered a few expert tips for managing the pain of medical expenses: © Getty Images/Tetra images RF   SAVE It's much easier to bear big expenses when you have some emergency savings. If you don't have much set aside, you aren't alone. Two-thirds of Americans would have difficulty coming up with the money to cover a $1,000 emergency, according to a poll conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Start small, automate your savings and try to keep your hands off it unless you really need it. Other preventative steps include staying within your health insurer's network or bundling your care so you reach deductibles sooner. You may also want to get an estimate of costs ahead of time so you can better prepare. Some providers and insurers will help with this or you can use Amino, a free online service that estimates the costs of many common health care procedures. © Getty Images   VERIFY Review all your bills carefully when they arrive. About half of medical bills contain errors, said Caitlin Donovan of the National Patient Advocate Foundation. Make sure you are being billed only for services and goods you received. If you feel like you are being billed for something that should be covered by insurance, reach out to your plan for an explanation. You can also appeal any decision by your insurer not to pay. There are companies that will audit bills for you to make sure they are correct. Some, like Remedy, will only take a percentage of what they save you as payment. You can also reach out to a patient advocate organization for assistance. © David Gould/Getty Images   SEEK AID If you cannot foot the bill at all, seek help as soon as possible. Hospitals are often willing to negotiate the amount you owe or set up a payment plan. Ask if they have a financial assistance plan or know of one that could help you. There are many nonprofit organizations set up specifically to help people manage their medical bills. Also consider seeking help from friends or family with a crowdfunding page, such as Gofundme.com.

Counter-cyclical sectors like consumer staples and utilities traded lower and only the financial and healthcare sectors showed much of a gain. Everyone must be worn out following the frenzy of the Snap IPO. WTI crude oil for April delivery settled at $53.33 a barrel, up 1.4% on the day, but down 1.2% for the week. April gold dropped 0.5% on the day to settle at $1,226.50 and down 2.5% for the week. Equities were headed for a higher close shortly before the bell as the DJIA traded up 0.03% for the day, the S&P 500 traded up 0.02%, and the Nasdaq Composite traded up 0.09%. Stocks traded very near the break even line just minutes before the closing bell. The closing tally could differ from these results. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Friday was The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) which traded up 1.08% at $253.76. The stock’s 52-week range is $138.20 to $255.15. Volume was about 40% below the daily average of around 4 million shares. The investment bank had no specific news. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) traded up 0.85% at $92.92. The stock’s 52-week range is $57.05 to $93.98. Volume was about 30% below the daily average of around 16 million shares. The big bank had no specific news. Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) traded up 0.80% at $95.11. The stock’s 52-week range is $69.04 to $99.46. Volume was nearly 40% higher than the daily average of around 4.7 million shares. Federal law enforcement officers on Thursday executed a search warrant on company facilities in Illinois. Cat appears to have shaken off the news. The Walt Disney Co. (NYSE: DIS) traded up 0.62% at $111.28. The stock’s 52-week range is $90.32 to $111.99. Volume was about 40% below the daily average of around 7.5 million shares. The media giant’s latest superhero film, “Logan,” opens Friday with weekend sales forecast at more than $80 million in box office receipts. Of the Dow 30 stocks, 12 are on track to close higher Friday and 18 are set to close lower.

(Reuters) WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump’s administration said on Friday it is suspending action on an Obama administration decision in October to probe a long-time practice by some airlines of preventing various travel websites from showing their fares and whether to require transparency in airline baggage and other fees. The US Transportation Department said in a notice Friday it is suspending a public comment period on the review of the practices to “allow the president’s appointees the opportunity to review and consider this action.” Airlines generated $3.8 billion in baggage fees in 2015 and the Obama administration said in October it was formally exploring requiring airlines and ticket agents to provide consumers with prices that include service fees for baggage and other services alongside fares at points of sale. Separately, the Trump administration is also extending the compliance date for a new regulation requiring reporting of data for mishandled baggage and wheelchairs in aircraft cargo compartments for one year — until Jan. 1, 2019. Airlines for America, the industry trade group representing American Airlines Group Inc., United Continental Holdings Inc., Southwest Airlines Co. and others, praised the decision. “Today’s action is a common sense measure reinforcing that the airline industry is capable of making the decisions that best serve our customers, our employees and the communities we serve,” said Nicholas Calio, the airlines’ group chief executive Nicholas Calio. The group said in a statement that the “airline industry operates under 13,000 regulations across 13 agencies, many of which are outdated, obsolete and in need of reform.” Trump met with airline chief executives last month and asked them to identify regulatory hurdles preventing job growth in the industry. A study commissioned by a travel agencies’ trade group, the Travel Technology Association, in 2014 found that restricting the ability to comparison-shop would result in ticket prices increasing more than 11 percent. Airline shares rose on the news. JPMorgan said in a research note Friday that “the protections never mattered in the first place — the financial impact of the Obama protections was largely irrelevant, in our view.” The Obama administration efforts were very modest, JPMorgan said, and did not propose limiting airlines’ ability to pursue ancillary revenue, such as an outright ban on bag fees. But JPMorgan added: “US airlines appear to increasingly have the ear of a sympathetic, regulatory-averse administration.” WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump’s administration said on Friday it is suspending action on an Obama administration decision in October to probe a long-time practice by some airlines of preventing various travel websites from showing their fares and whether to require transparency in airline baggage and other fees.

Though GDP growth contracted by -1.51 per cent in full year, the growth figures in Q4 was indicative of gradual movement away from the economic quagmire, given that the economy recorded much negative contraction in the third quarter and given that all the quarters in the year under review recorded declines in growth. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), in its GDP Growth Estimates for the Fourth Quarter 2016, though the decline in Q4 was less severe than the contraction in the previous quarter, it was nevertheless lower than the 2.11 per cent growth rate recorded in Q4 2015. The NBS noted that the contraction in the quarter under review reflected, “A difficult year for Nigeria, which included weaker inflation- induced consumption demand, an increase in pipeline vandalism, significantly reduced foreign reserves and a concomitantly weaker currency, and problems in the energy sector such as fuel shortages and lower electricity generation.” In monetary terms, real GDP was valued at N18.29 trillion in Q4 and N67.98 trillion in 2016 as a whole. Though oil production improved to 1.90 million barrels per day (mbpd) in Q4, indicating a 0.27 mbpd higher than the 1.63 mbpd production volume in the previous quarter, oil sector contracted by -13.65 per cent in the year, representing a more significant decline more than the -5.45 per cent in 2015. Oil sector share of real GDP also reduced to 8.42 per cent in 2016 compared to 9.61 per cent in 2015. According to the NBS, “This reduction has largely been attributed to vandalism in the Niger Delta region. As a result, the sector contracted by -13.65 per cent; a more significant decline than that in 2015 of -5.45 per cent.” On the other hand, the non-oil sector declined by -0.33 per cent in real terms in Q4 but increased its share of GDP to 92.85 per cent from 91.94 per cent in Q4 2015. Essentially, Mining and Quarrying contributed 7.32 per cent to real GDP in Q4, representing a decline of 0.89 per cent relative to the corresponding quarter of 2015 and also a decline of 1.02 per cent points relative to the third quarter of 2016. Agriculture contributed 25.49 per cent to overall GDP in the quarter under review, higher than its share of 24.18 per cent in Q4 2015, but less than its share in the previous quarter of 28.65 per cent. For 2016 as whole, agriculture increased its share relative to 2015 to 24.43 per cent due to its relatively strong growth rate. However, the contribution of manufacturing to Nominal GDP was 8.34 per cent lower than the 9.09 per cent recorded in the corresponding period of 2015, and 8.59 per cent in the third quarter of 2016. Real GDP growth in manufacturing remained negative in Q4 2016; a contraction of 2.54 per cent was recorded (year-on-year). According to the NBS, this reflected a number of challenges faced by manufacturing in 2016, such as higher costs of imported inputs as a result of the exchange rate, and higher energy costs as a result of a fall in electricity generation, and more expensive fuel. Although, economic analysts see the slowed contraction as positive signs for exiting the recession, current macroeconomic indicators including lack of infrastructure, foreign exchange crisis, high unemployment rate and inflationary pressures remained major challenges to future economic prospects. Nevertheless, the recent appreciation in oil prices and relative peace in the Niger Delta region as well as recent success achieved in the foreign exchange management by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) appear to offer further hopes of prosperity in the first quarter of the year. Specifically, analysts who spoke with THISDAY said notwithstanding the seeming improvement in growth figures, relative to previous abysmal performances in preceding quarters, it would be too early to roll out the drums in celebration of improved condition in the economy. Director General, West African Institute for Financial and Economic Management (WAIFEM), Prof. Akpan Ekpo, noted that the -1.5 per cent growth of GDP in 2016 confirmed that the economy was deep in recession last year. “Even if a marginal positive growth in GDP takes the economy technically out of a recession, the structural problems remain,” he pointed out. Ekpo, however, added that, “The visible hand of government via spending would enable the economy exit the recession. If 80 per cent of the projects in the 2017 budget are implemented growth would be restored and a robust monetary policy would further enhance growth.” But, the renowned economist and former CBN director cautioned, “The slight increases in oil prices should not derail the policies, strategies and programmes meant to diversify the economy, “ stating that, “The real sector particularly manufacturing must be revamped.” An Associate Professor of Finance and Head, Banking and Finance Department, Nasarawa State University, Keffi, Dr. Uche Uwaleke, expressed concerns over the persistent inflationary pressure amid growth prospects. According to him, “In view of the GDP growth rates of -2.06 per cent and -2.24 per cent recorded in Q2 and Q3 of 2016 respectively, the Q4 figure of -1.30 per cent simply suggests that the recession is becoming less severe and the country may well be on the path of recovery. It is interesting to note that the 2016 full year figure of -1.5 per cent is lower than the forecast of -1.7 per cent earlier made by the IMF. “ As you well know, the fall in oil revenue is largely to blame for the economic recession given the mono-product nature of the economy. I think that the current positive developments in the international oil market and the relative peace in the Niger Delta region if sustained will combine to improve revenue for all tiers of government and in particular put the state governments in a stronger position to regularly pay workers’ salaries.” “This will boost demand for goods and services and generally increase the tempo of economic activities. So, I see the country exiting the recession in a few months’ time. However, there is the inflationary pressure to tackle. Even when GDP eventually turns positive, a high rate of inflation as we have it today (a little shy of 20 per cent) will rubbish any favourable impact the GDP figure may have on an already high misery index. “No doubt, the end of recession will be good news for the Central Bank not least because monetary policy implementation will be made a lot easier. Be that as it may, the fight against inflation should not be left to the CBN alone in view of the fact that the key drivers of inflation in Nigeria today, as confirmed by the NBS (high cost of fuel, transport, electricity, housing, food), are largely non-monetary factors. More than ever before, sound fiscal policies are required to address these challenges.” Also, economist and former acting Managing Director of Unity Bank Plc, Dr. Muhammad Rislanudeen, said coupled with current GDP growth prospects, the CBN needed to bring much more clarity to forex management and as well curb inflation to keep current hope of recovery alive. He said: “Even though year on year GDP growth rate contracted to -1.51 per cent in 2016 from 2.11 per cent in 2015, it looks like with reduced pace of both contraction in GDP from -2.24 per cent in third quarter 2016 to -1.30 per cent in fourth quarter 2016, we have seen the worst of the current recession. Also, the pace of month on month increase ininflation has started displaying decreasing rate of increase like from 18.55 per cent in December 2016 to 18.72 per cent in January 2017. “In response to National Economic Council’s advice to CBN to change its archaic foreign exchange policy, massive injection of liquidity of USD370 million, USD230 million and USD180 million has done the magic of bringing down the black market rate from about NGN520 to about NGN450. “This is positive as it will significantly help to tame down imported inflation and minimise activities of speculative demand as well as rent seeking. However, sustaining this positive trend require increased clarity in CBN foreign exchange policy, closing other forex windows thereby encouraging private investors to provide more liquidity in the market.” According to him, “With six months foreign exchange forward contracts quoted at NGN381 and maturing three months at NGN354, Bloomberg quoted JP Morgan Chase and Renaissance capital as saying that without free floating currency, Nigeria will still struggle to lure back foreign investors. “We had a fire brigade approach on foreign exchange policy beginning last week, which in part, worked to close the exchange rate gap. However to consolidate on this, CBN need to close other forex windows and leave only CBN quote and Interbank which can be allowed to partially float with intermittent intervention by CBN to provide stability and liquidity. This will incentivise private investors especially foreign investors where emerging markets are a good investment destination given the low interest rate in developed world. For example, rates in Bank of England is 0.25 per cent, 0.5 per cent in U.S. Federal reserve and almost zero in Eurozone while Japan’s economy is still in deflation with negative interest rate.” “With the right forex policy, investment by foreign portfolio investors in Nigeria’s fixed income market is attractive with current tax free interest rate of about 18.44 per cent. Fiscal authorities should also work with CBN to ensure both monetary, fiscal and trade policies complement rather than contradict each other within the context of proposed economic recovery and growth plan due to be launched soon by the President.” Similarly, economist and ex-banker, Dr. Chijioke Ekechukwu said a lot of work is still needed to be done especially at the macroeconomic level to achieve and sustain growth. He said: “With a daily oil production of 2.1million barrels of Oil, arising from a relaxed Niger Delta restiveness within the period under review, and with the Crude Oil Price hovering between $54 to $56 per barrel, it is expected that we should achieve some level of marginal GDP growth within the 1st quarter. “This growth can be sustained in the 2nd quarter. It is however, not time to roll out drums yet. A lot of work still needs to be done to improve on the other Macro Economic indicators of Inflation, Foreign Exchange Price and its stability, Employment, Balance of Payment etc. Frantic efforts therefore should be made towards improving on all the foregoing indices by putting a self-driven machinery in place.” Also, Executive Director, Corporate Finance, BGL Capital Limited, Mr. Femi Ademola said the economy may be headed to the inflexion point where growth will turn positive but added that it is important to await positive economic growth before celebrating a possible exit from recession. According to him, “The overall news is that the economy contracted in the 4th quarter and in 2016 generally. However it is consoling that the decline is lower than expected and lower than the previous quarters. “This may be an indication that we are getting to the inflexion point where growth will turn positive. The improvement in oil production and higher oil price can help economic growth. “Increased spending on infrastructure can also help growth in the first quarter of 2017 and thereafter. We need to wait for positive economic growth before rolling out the drums.” To the Managing Director and Chief Economist, Global Research, Africa, Razia Khan, “A contraction in GDP last year was a foregone conclusion. The real issue is the nature of recovery that the Nigerian economy now sees. Do we see the economy ambling along, with a return to positive but still-low growth because the base from last year was so weak? Or do we see strong reformist momentum, that is able to drive higher investment levels and a much more robust growth rate? The latter is likely to be possible only with reliance on foreign flows in the near-term. That will require some measure of market determination of the FX rate.” Besides, Director, Union Capital Markets Ltd, Egie Akpata, who noted that, “The results are largely in line with most analyst forecasts,” believed, “After a sustained contraction, there is likely to be a rebound as the economy adjusts to the new exchange rate and other variables.” Akpata, however, pointed out that, it is interesting that most forecasts show very marginal growth in GDP for 2017. “In order to see significant growth in GDP this year, the authorities will need to fix the FX situation and drive down interest rates. It is unlikely that a number of key sectors can grow meaningfully without access to FX or borrowing from banks at 30 per cent.” “CBN MPC decisions in the next 2 meetings will have a big impact on the level of growth to be achieved in 2017. Same for the ability of the Federal Government to quickly implement the 2017 budget,” he added. Reasoning along the same line, analysts at Renaissance Capital, pointed out that, notwithstanding the Q4 2016 report, their outlook for 2017 is predicated on foreign exchange policy and resolution of the crisis in Niger Delta. According to them, “Our 2017 growth projection of 0.5 per cent is premised on an improvement in capex, agriculture sustaining c. 4 per cent growth, and oil output stabilising at c. 2mbd. The $1.5billion in foreign loans that the government has secured since November for the budget, and those to come suggests we should see a lift in capex in 2017, compared to 2016. The recent narrowing of the spread between the official and parallel FX rates is positive. “However, this policy is premised on the central bank sustaining sizeable net FX inflows. For a sustained improvement in liquidity, we believe the central bank needs to ease FX controls, unify the FX rates and allow for price discovery. This would help key sectors like trade and manufacturing recover. We think a resolution in the Niger Delta would allow for oil output to stabilise at c. 2mbd and support a recovery in FX liquidity.” However, analysts at FBN Capital expressed disappointment at the performance of the economy in the review period. “Our expectation was modest GDP growth in Q4 on the basis of some recovery in the non-oil economy with help from the usual, seasonal boost. This did not materialise, and the slump in real oil output was worse than we anticipated. That fall was slower than the previous quarter yet still in double digits (-12.4% y/y),” they said. The analysts pointed out that, “FGN has a major role to play in economic recovery on the fiscal side. Construction contracted for the sixth successive quarter, by 6.1 per cent y/y, and stands to benefit from the planned acceleration in capital releases to spending ministries.” Previous articleThe Future of Nigeria: Inter-Generational Dialogue as Next Step Next articleElectrical Safety: Expert Preaches Standard, Compliance Online Editor RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Business Banks Begin Compliance with Directive on FX Teller Points Business Shell Shuts Down 225,000bpd Bonga Deepwater Field for Maintenance Business NBS: Imported Agric Products Totalled N212.73bn in Q4 the thinker so buhari is merely a scourge on nigeria? chai! 985,428FansLike 722,935FollowersFollow Latest News All is Set, Says Govt as Abuja Airport Closes at Midnight...

Wells Fargo set off alarm bells throughout the banking industry after thousands of employees were caught signing customers to new accounts without their knowledge or permission. But the vast majority of major players in Chicago's retail banking landscape still have incentive programs for their branch workers. And many won't discuss what employee behavior they're rewarding in any but the most general of terms. One big player isn't taking any chances. Rosemont-based Wintrust Financial, the fifth-largest deposit holder in the market, eliminated its programs that rewarded branch employees when they sold customers new checking accounts or other products. Wintrust scrapped its retail incentives last year after the Wells Fargo scandal erupted, the bank confirms. Wells Fargo, which for years was the envy of the industry in its ability to sell additional products to existing customers,​ proved how lethal such compensation arrangements can be to a bank's reputation if they go bad. CEO John Stumpf was forced to resign last year. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo continues to see higher-than-normal rates of customer attrition and a drop-off in new business, six months after the scandal broke. At Wintrust, some branch employees earned small-scale rewards for sales achievements. After Wells Fargo, Wintrust ordered an audit of all practices going back five years and found no improper employee behavior, CEO Edward Wehmer says in an interview. The payouts were small. "I think in five years it was less than 50 grand total we even paid out," he says. Wintrust branch employees get their salaries plus whatever bonus all company workers get. "I didn't want to have to answer the question," he says. "You're never going to get (an incentive compensation system for branch workers) right." Most of the other larger retail banks in Chicago, though, aren't eliminating their incentive programs, based on a survey of them. And they're reticent to discuss the particulars of what they're incentivizing their employees to do. For example, a spokesman for BMO Harris Bank, the second-largest deposit holder in the Chicago market, says it continues to have incentive programs for branch employees. But he declines to discuss what they entail. "We consistently review our sales incentive programs, and make changes as necessary, with the first priority focused on doing the right thing for our customers," he writes in an email. He declines to say whether BMO Harris altered its programs following the Wells Fargo fiasco. Likewise, spokeswomen for New York-based JPMorgan Chase and Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America, the largest and third-largest deposit holders in the Chicago market, respectively, won't discuss specifics and point to general statements from company executives. Marianne Lake, JPMorgan chief financial officer, told analysts on Oct. 14 that branch-worker incentive programs are designed to ensure customers are "in the right products for the right reasons." To the extent that bankers have talked specifics, they've said the key is to compensate employees who bring in customers who are active, not simply opening accounts. "Our compensation systems were all changed to compensate based on client satisfaction, based on assets, not widgets or numbers of accounts," Dean Athanasia, Bank of America's co-head of consumer banking, said at a Feb. 7 investor presentation. "We don't pay if you set up an account and the client doesn't use it." Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bank, the ninth-largest bank by deposits in the Chicago market, now emails a welcome letter to every customer who opens an account of any kind and asks them to call if they didn't ask for it. The bank began the practice after the Wells Fargo scandal broke, a spokesman says. Itasca-based First Midwest Bank, Chicago's 12th-largest deposit holder, reviewed and audited its branch compensation system and opted not to change anything, President Mark Sander says. "We don't think cross-selling is a bad word if it provides value to a client," he says. First Midwest does compensate branch employees for new accounts, but only if they're actively used, Sander says. "We don't have goals of number of products per client." Representatives of Chicago-based MB Financial, Chicago's sixth-largest deposit holder, didn't respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Chicago-based PrivateBank & Trust says branch incentives aren't "relevant" for the bank, since it focuses almost exclusively on business clients. In Chicago, Wells Fargo has a substantial commercial banking presence but just a handful of branches. Banks are likely to feel more pressure in coming quarters to grow deposits as interest rates rise and demand for loans continues to pick up. That's a potential recipe for more pressure on people on the retail front lines. With their stock prices up substantially since the election, bank executives are under little to no investor pressure to heed the Wells Fargo warning. It will be up to them to be disciplined....

REUTERS/Joshua RobertsMore By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Friday it is suspending action on an Obama administration decision in October to probe a long-time practice by some airlines of preventing various travel websites from showing their fares and whether to require transparency in airline baggage and other fees. The U.S. Transportation Department said in a notice Friday it is suspending a public comment period on the review of the practices to "allow the president’s appointees the opportunity to review and consider this action." Airlines generated $3.8 billion in baggage fees in 2015 and the Obama administration said in October it was formally exploring requiring airlines and ticket agents to provide consumers with prices that include service fees for baggage and other services alongside fares at points of sale. Separately, the Trump administration is also extending the compliance date for a new regulation requiring reporting of data for mishandled baggage and wheelchairs in aircraft cargo compartments for one year - until Jan. 1, 2019. Airlines for America, the industry trade group representing American Airlines Group Inc , United Continental Holdings Inc , Southwest Airlines Co and others, praised the decision. "Today’s action is a common sense measure reinforcing that the airline industry is capable of making the decisions that best serve our customers, our employees and the communities we serve," the airlines' group chief executive Nicholas Calio said in a statement. The group added the "airline industry operates under 13,000 regulations across 13 agencies, many of which are outdated, obsolete and in need of reform." President Donald Trump met with airline chief executives last month and asked them to identify regulatory hurdles preventing job growth in the industry. A study commissioned by a travel agencies' trade group, the Travel Technology Association, in 2014 found that restricting the ability to comparison-shop would result in ticket prices increasing more than 11 percent. Airline shares rose on the news. JPMorgan said in a research note Friday that the "the protections never mattered in the first place - the financial impact of the Obama protections was largely irrelevant, in our view." The Obama administration efforts were very modest, JPMorgan said, and did not propose limiting airlines’ ability to pursue ancillary revenue, such as an outright ban on bag fees. But JPMorgan added: "U.S. airlines appear to increasingly have the ear of a sympathetic, regulatory-averse administration."

Both companies have denied any wrongdoing. Charges filed at the High Court in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, allege the companies paid $801 million to former Oil Minister Dan Etete, former Justice Minister Mohammed Bello Adoke and businessman Aliyu Abubakar for the license to OPL 245. Nigeria's government got only $210 million from the deal. "These charges show Nigeria's intention to fight corruption by holding the powerful to account," Simon Taylor of corruption watchdog Global Witness said in a statement Saturday. "The days when oil companies could use their influence to keep backroom deals with corrupt officials under wraps are over." He said the alleged bribes amount to 80 percent of Nigeria's 2015 health budget.

Also charged is Malabu Oil, the company Etete set up secretly and awarded OPL 245 while he was oil minister. Etete, Adoke and Abubakar, all believed to be living in Europe, could not be reached for comment. The charges were laid by Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, which in January won a court order ceding control of the oil bloc to the government. The commission also has filed new money-laundering charges against Adoke, alleging he corruptly received an additional $2.2 million in 2013 as payment for brokering the deal. advertisement | advertise on newsday The oil companies have declared their innocence, saying the money was paid to Nigeria's government. Shell and Eni paid $1.1 billion into a Nigerian escrow account at the London branch of JPMorgan Chase in 2011. Adoke, who was then the justice minister and attorney general, authorized its distribution. The court document alleged the oil companies and their executives "corruptly gave" the money and "thus committed an offense" under Nigeria's Corrupt Practices Act. Global Witness said in a statement that "Shell and Eni have always denied that they knew the money would go to Malabu, but documents seen by Global Witness show that the companies constructed the deal knowing that the money would flow ultimately to Etete's company." Global Witness said the case highlights the need for regulations forcing extractive companies to make public the payments made to governments. President Donald Trump has been expected to overturn such a regulation in the United States. The scandal around OPL 245 has drawn investigators from the United States, Italy, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands. @Newsday Tweets from @Newsday/newsday-staff Italian prosecutors last month asked for Eni, Shell, Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi and 10 others to stand trial for alleged corruption. Eni said it had investigated the allegations and found "no evidence of corrupt conduct." Shell has said that it "takes this matter seriously and is co-operating with the authorities."

(NYSE: VRX) saw its shares hit a multiyear low this past week. There was hope for a turnaround when Joe Papa took over as chief executive officer, but it seems that little has gone his way, especially after the company reported earnings early this week. Some analysts took this opportunity to reevaluate their stance on the stock. Although this might be a buy for some, the returns look to be getting smaller. The company said that it had $1.26 in earnings per share (EPS) and $2.4 billion in revenue. The consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters had called for $1.21 in EPS and revenue of $2.34 billion. The same period of last year reportedly had EPS of $2.50 on $2.79 billion in revenue. The decrease in revenues for the quarter was primarily driven by a reduction in product sales from the existing business of $310 million and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange of $43 million. Revenues in the quarter were further affected by a drop in realized pricing by 3%, along with divestitures and discontinuations of $16 million. In terms of guidance for the 2017 full year, the company expects to see revenues in the range of $8.90 billion to $9.10 billion with an adjusted EBITDA between $3.55 billion and $3.70 billion. The consensus estimates are $4.76 in EPS and $8.97 billion in revenue for the full year. Jefferies looked at the data and maintained its Buy rating but cut its price target by roughly 18%. The firm lowered its price target to $18 from $22, and it wasn’t the only one being cautious. A few other firms followed suit: BTIG reiterated a Neutral rating. BMO Capital Markets reiterated a Market Perform rating but lowered its price target to $19 from $21. JPMorgan has a Hold rating with a $15 price target. RBC lowered it price target to $21. Apart from these, Jefferies detailed the reasoning in its report: Mgt’s rev outlook ($8.9-9.1B) bracketed consensus. However, adj EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $3.55-3.70B (vs $3.88B consensus) as Valeant plans to further invest in its R&D pipeline and step up promotion to drive longer term value for its key GI franchises (40% increase in reps). As such, adj EBITDA margin should dip to 40.3% (midpoint of guidance) vs 45.7% in FY16. Mgt appears to be of the view that the loss of exclusivities (LOEs) on drugs such as Solodyn and Acanya can be offset by new launches (Siliq, Vyzulta, etc.) with the implication that FY17 could be a “trough” year prior to the potential re-emergence of growth in FY18 and beyond. We cut our FY17 & FY18 rev & EPS estimates to $8.92B & $3.88 and $8.88B & $4.17 (vs $9.08B & $4.95 and $9.12B & $5.37). Shares of Valeant closed Friday down 5% at $13.06, with a consensus analyst price target of $21.34 and a 52-week trading range of $12.90 to $70.43.

Both companies have denied any wrongdoing. Charges filed at the High Court in Nigeria's capital, Abuja, allege the companies paid $801 million to former Oil Minister Dan Etete, former Justice Minister Mohammed Bello Adoke and businessman Aliyu Abubakar for the license to OPL 245. Nigeria's government got only $210 million from the deal. "These charges show Nigeria's intention to fight corruption by holding the powerful to account," Simon Taylor of corruption watchdog Global Witness said in a statement Saturday. "The days when oil companies could use their influence to keep backroom deals with corrupt officials under wraps are over." He said the alleged bribes amount to 80 percent of Nigeria's 2015 health budget. Nigerian High Court papers stamped Thursday and seen by The Associated Press name the accused as the Nigeria subsidiary of British-Dutch Shell and its ex-director Ralph Wetzels, Italy's Eni, Eni's Nigeria subsidiary Agip and directors Roberto Casula, Stefano Pujatti and Sebastiano Burrafato. Also charged is Malabu Oil, the company Etete set up secretly and awarded OPL 245 while he was oil minister. Etete, Adoke and Abubakar, all believed to be living in Europe, could not be reached for comment. The charges were laid by Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, which in January won a court order ceding control of the oil bloc to the government. The commission also has filed new money-laundering charges against Adoke, alleging he corruptly received an additional $2.2 million in 2013 as payment for brokering the deal. The oil companies have declared their innocence, saying the money was paid to Nigeria's government. Shell and Eni paid $1.1 billion into a Nigerian escrow account at the London branch of JPMorgan Chase in 2011. Adoke, who was then the justice minister and attorney general, authorized its distribution. The court document alleged the oil companies and their executives "corruptly gave" the money and "thus committed an offense" under Nigeria's Corrupt Practices Act. Global Witness said in a statement that "Shell and Eni have always denied that they knew the money would go to Malabu, but documents seen by Global Witness show that the companies constructed the deal knowing that the money would flow ultimately to Etete's company." Global Witness said the case highlights the need for regulations forcing extractive companies to make public the payments made to governments. President Donald Trump has been expected to overturn such a regulation in the United States. The scandal around OPL 245 has drawn investigators from the United States, Italy, France, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Italian prosecutors last month asked for Eni, Shell, Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi and 10 others to stand trial for alleged corruption. Eni said it had investigated the allegations and found "no evidence of corrupt conduct." Shell has said that it "takes this matter seriously and is co-operating with the authorities."

Newsletters Site Log In Advisor Insights Log In Study: Investing and Cocaine Look Same to Brain By David Floyd | March 3, 2017 — 4:07 PM EST Share It's coming any minute now. You're refreshing the investor relations page constantly, cursing your garbage WiFi, twitching in anticipation of the latest earnings report. The stock has been slipping for weeks, and the TV pundits are saying the company's peaked, time to cash out and move on. You know they're wrong. Them: the analysts, the short-sellers. All sheep. And there it is. You click the link, and it's a dazzling sight. Top- and bottom-line beats. And that's not all: [pick your metric] growth that blew even the highest expectations out of the water. After-hours prices are already spiking – up 10 percent, 12 percent, 13 percent. You celebrate by cutting a line, rolling up a Benjamin, and hitting the slopes. From a number of perspectives – the legal one, chiefly – watching a risky financial bet pay off and using cocaine are very different things. But perhaps not to your brain, research suggests. According to a 2001 paper by Harvard Medical School's Hans Breiter and colleagues, "the activations seen in the NAc, SLEA, VT, and GOb in response to monetary prospects and outcomes overlap those observed in response to cocaine infusions in subjects addicted to cocaine." (Those abbreviations, if you were curious, mean nucleus accumbens, sublenticular extended amygdala, ventral tegmental and orbitofrontal cortex, respectively.) In other words, a fat line is to a coke addict what a fat win is to a trader (or gambler). This blurring of the financial and the narcotic sheds light on the behavioral and psychological dimensions of investing, which often go under-appreciated. Investors like to think of themselves as rational individuals with the mental acumen, emotional equilibrium and titanium gut necessary to thrive in turbulent markets. But irrational biases can creep in and hurt results. (See also, How does behavioral economics treat risk aversion?) Among cocaine's most pronounced side effects is the desire for more cocaine, preferably as much and as quickly as possible. If a savvy (or lucky) bet on a particular stock, currency or lotto number drives you to make another bold wager right away, you're likely to do a bit less homework, think a bit less critically and perhaps throw a lot of money away. Fiends aren't renowned for their wisdom. (See also, Unsuccessful Types of Stock Traders.) In his book "Your Money and Your Brain," Jason Zweig mentions the brain's similar reactions to cocaine and paper gains, along with a host of other human foibles that can lead to bad decision-making. "Financial losses are processed in the same areas of the brain that respond to mortal danger," he writes. A hard-wired tendency to expect anything that happens twice to happen a third time has very little to do with real-world probabilities. And most importantly, these effects are not mere mental ephemera: making and losing money produce "a biological change that has profound physical effects on the brain and body." Viewed in this light, spectacular trading losses like that of the London Whale – who made JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) $400 million with a single trade in 2011, then lost $6.2 billion the next year – make a bit more sense. (See also, How Big Data Is Monitoring Good and Bad Traders.) Luckily a bit of discipline and frequent reality checks can dampen the effects of psychological biases. The first step, however, is to accept that you are not quite as steely and objective as you'd like to think. You may go by the numbers, but the brain you use to process those numbers is a squishy, unreliable instrument. It evolved to form kinship bonds, hunt big furry beasts and gather nutritious plant matter. Remarkable as it is, it's no Bloomberg terminal. (See also, Avoid These Common Investing Psychology Traps.)

Airlines generated $3.8 billion in baggage fees in 2015 and the Obama administration said in October it was formally exploring requiring airlines and ticket agents to provide consumers with prices that include service fees for baggage and other services alongside fares at points of sale. The Trump administration suspended an Obama-era proposal on Friday, which was designed to investigate whether to force airlines to be more transparent with baggage and other fees Separately, the Trump administration is also extending the compliance date for a new regulation requiring reporting of data for mishandled baggage and wheelchairs in aircraft cargo compartments for one year - until January 1, 2019. Airlines for America, the industry trade group representing American Airlines Group Inc, United Continental Holdings Inc, Southwest Airlines Co and others, praised the decision. 'Today's action is a common sense measure reinforcing that the airline industry is capable of making the decisions that best serve our customers, our employees and the communities we serve,' the airlines' group chief executive Nicholas Calio said in a statement. The group added the 'airline industry operates under 13,000 regulations across 13 agencies, many of which are outdated, obsolete and in need of reform.' It comes after President Donald Trump met with airline chief executives last month and asked them to identify regulatory hurdles preventing job growth in the industry Airlines generated $3.8 billion in baggage fees in 2015 and the Obama administration wanted to formally explore requiring airlines and ticket agents to provide consumers with full prices President Donald Trump met with airline chief executives last month and asked them to identify regulatory hurdles preventing job growth in the industry.

The Fed last lifted its benchmark rate in December to a range of 0.5 percent to .75 percent. Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said Friday that the Fed is likely to raise its benchmark interest rate this month, barring any unpleasant economic surprises. Yellen's declaration, in a speech in Chicago, capped an intensification in the Fed's communication in recent days as officials put investors on notice that a rate increase is coming sooner than had been expected. "At our meeting later this month, the committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate," Yellen said, referring to the Fed's policymaking arm, the Federal Open Market Committee. The committee is scheduled to meet on March 14 and 15. Financial markets have taken the Fed's language in stride, which is likely to reinforce the confidence of Fed officials that they can safely raise rates. The Fed last lifted its benchmark rate in December, to a range of 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent. Rates remain at a low level by historical standards, supporting economic growth by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking. But Fed officials have increasingly concluded that the economy is nearing the end of its recovery from the 2008 financial crisis and that maintaining low rates could increase growth to an unsustainable pace. The unemployment rate, at 4.8 percent in January, is in a range Fed officials regard as healthy, and inflation is rising back toward the 2 percent level that the Fed considers optimal. Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, echoed Yellen in separate but simultaneous remarks Friday at a conference in New York. "We've seen a lot of substantial change in a relatively short time," Fischer said at the United States Monetary Policy Forum, noting what he described as a marked change in the economic weather since the presidential election on Nov. 8. "There is almost no economic indicator that has come in badly in the last three months." Asked whether Fed officials were engaged in a coordinated campaign to prepare markets for a rate increase later this month, Fischer replied, "If there has been a conscious effort, I'm about to join it." Yellen said she expected the Fed to raise rates by the end of the year to a level that would effectively end the central bank's stimulus campaign — something she said was likely to require three increases, each of 0.25 percentage points. She added that further increases were likely to be necessary in coming years to maintain a neutral stance. "On the whole, the prospects for further moderate economic growth look encouraging, particularly as risks emanating from abroad appear to have receded somewhat," she said. Just a few weeks ago, Wall Street analysts were skeptical that the Fed would raise rates in March. The Fed issued a measured statement after its last policy meeting in early February, and the meeting minutes, published three weeks later, conveyed little sense of urgency. Now, analysts regard a March increase as highly likely. Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, described the shift in Fed language as "remarkably swift and decisive." Investors put the chances at almost 80 percent in trading on Friday, according to a CME Group analysis of asset prices. The shift began earlier this week. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor who in recent years has been one of the most consistent advocates of raising interest rates slowly, suggested Wednesday that she, too, was ready to lift the benchmark rate. "We are closing in on full employment, inflation is moving gradually toward our target, foreign growth is on more solid footing, and risks to the outlook are as close to balanced as they have been in some time," Brainard said at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. "Assuming continued progress, it will likely be appropriate soon to remove additional accommodation, continuing on a gradual path."
