Morgan shareholders have rejected a proposal to split Jamie Dimon's dual roles as Chairman and CEO. Bobbi Rebell reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Jamie Dimon won a vote of confidence at JP Morgan Chase- and will retain both the Chairman and the CEO title of the company. Despite a bitter, months-long shareholder campaign- they voted by an overwhelming margin not to split the roles. Dimon had suggested he would leave the bank had the vote gone the other way. New York University Executive-in Residence and finance professor John Biggs- who is also a shareholder- says it's an all around win: SOUNDBITE: JOHN BIGGS, EXECUTIVE IN RESIDENCE AND ADJUST PROFESSOR OF FINANCE, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY (ENGLISH) SAYING: "First off, his record is unbelievably outstanding. And I don't think there is anybody that can add value to putting in, somehow confusing their role. Jamie Dimon is and incredibly hard-working, able, there is nobody even close to him in the financial world in terms of his ability to run that enterprise. And it just clutters it up to force somehow a chairman. I think it could probably only hurt the company, in a sense that it would just confuse who is in charge." S&P Capital IQ's Erik Oja thinks in general, banks should have the top jobs separated- just not in this case: SOUNDBITE: ERIK OJA, EQUITY ANALYST, S&P CAPITAL IQ (ENGLISH) SAYING: "We think that in this case it's unique for JP Morgan Chase because Mr. Dimon has done a really good job of running the bank since 2006 and secondly he doesn't have yet an appointed successor." Shares of JP Morgan Chase rose on the news. Oja raised his price target on the stock after the vote- and has it rated a buy. SOUNDBITE: ERIK OJA, EQUITY ANALYST, S&P CAPITAL IQ (ENGLISH) SAYING: "We think the stock is very attractive, particularly on price to earnings. Our target price of $58 is just over 10 times our forward EPS estimate, so we find it attractive. And we think that JP Morgan Chase is particularly strong with capital markets and we think that this quarter, which will be reported in mid-July, should have yet another good quarter of capital markets." Some investors say Dimon does need more oversight- after the bank posted more than $6 billion in losses last year- just not so much oversight that he would quit. JP Morgan does have a lead independent director- former ExxonMobil CEO Lee Raymond- who says that changes were coming on the board's risk committee- but did not elaborate. Despite this case, there has been a trend of splitting up the Chairman and CEO roles- many investors believe doing so keeps the CEO from having too much power over the board.

NEW YORK — Profits at JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America surged last year, the banks said Friday as the industry receives a boost from a stock market rally that accelerated after the presidential election. The industry is entering what analysts say could be a period of renewed growth as rising interest rates make it easier for banks to earn a profit and President-elect Donald Trump has said he will roll back regulations put in place after the financial crisis that have hampered industry profits. JPMorgan and Bank of America, two of the largest banks in the world, both beat analysts profit expectations and gave positive forecasts for the future. “The optimism for positive change here at Bank of America and among our customers is palpable,” Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said. The next administration has raised the prospect of corporate tax reform and regulatory changes, Moynihan said. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo trailed its competitors as it continues to recover from a sales scandal that put it in the crosshairs of lawmakers and sparked several federal investigations. In September, the bank admitted that thousands of low-level employees had set up sham accounts to meet sales quotas. In some cases, the customers were charged various fees for accounts they did not know existed.

Fatter revenue from stock and bond trading helped lift JPMorgan Chase's profit nearly 24 percent. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon voiced optimism for the future, saying, "The U.S. economy may be building momentum." Stronger trading revenue boosted Bank of America's earnings by almost 50 percent. Sharp cost cutting also helped. The rise in interest rates didn't come early enough to impact its bottom line. But the bank said that rise will help significantly expand its net interest income in the first quarter this year. Phoenix Financial Services chief market analyst Wayne Kaufman said expect more positive surprises from banks. SOUNDBITE: WAYNE KAUFMAN, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, PHOENIX FINANCIAL SERVICES, (ENGLISH) SAYING: "When you see they have less of a regulatory burden, these companies make more money when interest rates go up, and they make more money when the economy goes up." But scandal-plagued Wells Fargo was a party pooper Friday. Its profit fell for the fifth straight quarter. Next week, investors will get results from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Citigroup.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Investors betting U.S. banks will reap huge profits as interest rates rise under Donald Trump were surprised Friday by just how optimistic the nation’s biggest lenders are about the year ahead. Bank of America Corp. boosted its forecast for interest income, the money it gets from making loans and holding debt securities, predicting it’ll jump by about $600 million in the first quarter. Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, told clients that’s more than he expected and will help the shares outperform. JPMorgan Chase & Co. also sounded a note of confidence, and financial stocks rose more than other sectors. Banks have spent years waiting to earn more from lending as the Federal Reserve and other central banks held benchmarks close to zero to spur growth after the global financial crisis. While the Fed’s December rate hike came too late in the fourth quarter to upend the period’s results announced on Friday, investors and analysts are bullish on what lies ahead. “Today was what it was expected to be, which is strength in trading and moderate loan growth, still benign credit environment, but not a lot of evidence of the rates showing through yet,” said Shannon Stemm, an analyst at Edward Jones & Co. “The market is, correctly, still focused on what the improved environment means for 2017 results.” Stocks Climb The KBW Bank Index of 24 major U.S. lenders rose as much as 2.1 percent and was up 0.6 percent as of 12:37 p.m. in New York trading. That extended its gain since Trump’s victory in the presidential election to 24 percent. Wells Fargo & Co. climbed 0.7 percent, and Bank of America and JPMorgan rose 0.2 percent. Financial stocks were the day’s best performers among 11 major industries in the S&P 500 Index. Wells Fargo’s net interest income increased 7 percent to $12.4 billion in the quarter from a year earlier, while JPMorgan’s rose 5 percent to $12.1 billion. Still, both of those results matched analysts’ estimates, and Bank of America’s $10.3 billion fell short. Analysts including Stemm predict BofA will be among the biggest beneficiaries of higher rates. “While the recent rise in interest rates came too late to impact fourth-quarter results, we expect to see a significant increase in net interest income in the first quarter of 2017,” Bank of America Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said in a statement. Better Borrowers JPMorgan said it’s well positioned to benefit from the most recent rate increase and that net interest income will be up “modestly” in the first quarter compared with the fourth. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg calls for two more Fed rate hikes this year, and another two by mid-2018. The central bank raised the rate to a range of 50 to 75 basis points in December. Better-than-expected credit costs helped banks burnish fourth-quarter earnings. All three firms set aside less money than analysts expected to cover bad loans as consumers managed their finances and as oil prices stabilized, potentially helping borrowers in that industry keep up with debts. The three banks’ provisions totaled $2.44 billion, or about $800 million less than analysts had estimated. JPMorgan led the trio with $864 million in loan-loss provisions, $509 million better than analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. “Loan losses have been at trough levels and they can’t stay here forever,” Stemm said. “We and other analysts were baking in a slow move toward normalization and you really didn’t see any of that happen, and in fact it got better.” Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are set to report quarterly earnings next week. Avoiding Losses A year ago, investors worried slumping oil prices would create billions of dollars in losses for the largest banks. But crude prices have roughly doubled since a February low. JPMorgan said that in the fourth quarter the firm was able to draw back funds it had once set aside for potential losses in its oil and gas portfolio. The financial industry seems to have avoided the worst of it, Stemm said. “The concerns were elevated almost exactly a year ago from today, and it appears that a lot of those concerns probably won’t come to fruition,” she said. “Some of that money they are flowing back into earnings and that’s just indicative of the change in energy markets.”   © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    U.S. bank stocks will stay in favor with investors as long as earnings reports in the coming week show an improving profit outlook while investors wait to see if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump lives up to his campaign promises. Wells Fargo & Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of America kicked off the earnings season on a positive note on Friday, sending the S&P 500's banking sub-sector up as much as 2.3 percent to its highest since February 2008 before paring gains. It closed trading up 0.8 percent compared with a 0.2 percent gain for the broader S&P 500. The banks' top executives expressed optimism on Friday about 2017 in their first public comments about earnings since Trump won the presidential election on Nov. 8. The bank index rose 24.8 percent between Nov. 8 and Dec. 9 then traded sideways for a month as bond yields fell. Investors were waiting for earnings and for concrete plans from Trump who has said he supports lower taxes, fiscal stimulus and lighter regulation, which would all help banks. Results and guidance from the big banks scheduled to report in the week ahead could boost the sector, according to John Praveen, chief investment strategist at Prudential International Investments Advisers LLC in Newark, New Jersey. "Results are likely to be good and the outlook is going to be positive so there's room for further gains," said Praveen. The S&P banks index has traded recently at 13.6 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months compared with its five-year average multiple of about 11 but in line with the 10-year average of 13.1, including the 2008 financial crisis, according to Thomson Reuters data. The banks' multiple is well below the broader S&P 500's forward price/earnings ratio of 17. But the banks' discount to the broader market has been shrinking since before the election. Praveen sees a bigger multiple expansion for the banking sector than for the S&P as a whole as more defensive sectors like utilities or consumer staples that are sensitive to interest rate hikes will likely not enjoy as much expansion. Among banks reporting in the coming week Morgan Stanley is expected to post results Tuesday followed by Citibank on Wednesday. BB&T Corp, KeyCorp and Bank of New York Mellon Corp all report on Thursday. Fred Cannon, director of research at KBW in New York, said banks' expanded valuations make them a "show-me" story but as long as earnings estimates are rising they should stay popular. "Until we see the blue skies get cloudy it will probably still be a sector in favor," he said. Some investors are more cautious going into earnings. For instance traders in Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund options have moved to protect post-election gains. Open contracts on the fund's shares are now the most defensive in about four weeks, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert. "The banks' stocks are likely to chop along in sideways volatility through earnings season," said Jeff Morris, head of U.S. equities for Standard Life Investments in Boston, who doesn't see earnings as a big catalyst at a time when there is still uncertainty about whether Trump will be able to enact policies expected to help banks and accelerate economic growth. While his firm has increased the weighting of bank stocks in its $360 billion assets under management since the election it is "not in the strong bull camp for bank stocks," Morris said. He warned that bank stocks could come under pressure if there is no clear path toward regulatory relief or an acceleration of economic growth coming into the third quarter. © 2017 Thomson/Reuters.

Chandrasekaran speaks during a news conference in Mumbai/REUTERS/File Photo. Mumbai: Moving the head of Tata Consultancy Services to the top job at Tata Sons' holding company fills a critical hole for the salt-to-software conglomerate, but it leaves another at its most valuable company ahead of a complex and unpredictable 2017. The promotion of Tata veteran Natarajan Chandrasekaran - the well-regarded, high-performing boss of TCS under whom shares has quadrupled - should be no surprise. But the departure of Chandrasekaran, known as Chandra, from the Tata group's most profitable arm still rattled investors. They sent TCS shares down more than 4 percent on Friday, a day after it also posted better-than-expected quarterly results. "The IT industry is facing headwinds, and shareholders would have preferred Chandra to stay as CEO for some more time," said Souvik Guha, an analyst with Shriram Asset Management, which owns shares in TCS. Indeed, for Tata Sons, promoting one-time Tata intern Chandrasekaran to chairman of the $100 billion conglomerate is something of a gamble: to help unpick the group's boardroom troubles, he leaves behind the growth engine and crown jewel. The vast majority of Tata Sons' annual revenue comes from dividend payouts. Key businesses include Tata Steel and Jaguar Land Rover-owner Tata Motors. But TCS, with its IT services and consulting businesses, accounts for nearly 90 percent of total group revenue. Investor concerns highlight the outsized importance of TCS, more than 70 percent owned by Tata. "Investors were more confident about Chandra," said a fund manager at a local mutual fund, which owns shares in TCS. "In a tough time when volume growth is elusive, you want someone with a proven track record and it would been preferable to have someone from the business side." Chandrasekaran has been replaced at TCS by Rajesh Gopinathan, described by analysts and insiders as a meticulous operations man. Fund managers fret, however, over the vision for the IT services firm, at a time when it needs to tackle slowing growth in the industry and a problematic period ahead. From an incoming Donald Trump administration in the United States, determined to clamp down on visas vital to the smooth operations of IT services companies in their biggest market, to the still unravelling fallout from Britain's move to bow out of the European Union, TCS will face one of its most complex years. Some also fear that Chandra will have little opportunity to lavish attention on TCS in the new role, as he will be saddled with untying the Gordian knot of Tata Sons politics, and also overseeing 200 group companies - all against the background of a bitter ongoing spat with its ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry. Mistry has publicly detailed the complex array of problems the conglomerate faces from its troubled European steel segment, from ethical concerns to allegations of fraudulent transactions at its Air Asia India joint-venture, and a host of other issues. ROCKING THE BOAT Chandra, who joined the Tata group in 1987, rose through the ranks to become TCS CEO in 2009. Under his leadership, TCS revenue has risen almost fourfold and its workforce has almost tripled. TCS has fared better than rivals Infosys and Wipro. This is despite a rapidly evolving landscape that has forced IT services players to rethink some increasingly commoditised services and innovate with offerings such as automation and artificial intelligence to win clients and boost revenue. The size of TCS has long been its strength, but the changes in the industry mean its size could also become a challenge. "In a time marked with multiple challenges and key headwinds impacting the IT sector, this is not an apt moment to rock the boat for TCS," said Reliance Securities analyst Harit Shah, adding that Chandra's relationships will be missed. TCS has more than tripled the number of its $100 million plus accounts in the last six years to 34 from 10, according to data from JPMorgan. Over that same period, Infosys has only grown that customer base to 18 from 11. Its stock has also vastly outperformed both Infosys and its third-largest Indian rival, Wipro, in that same period. Inside the company, executives at the 350,000-strong firm are more confident, describing the new TCS chief, Gopinathan, as "hands-on". "Chandra will be at the helm and he will continue to guide the new CEO," said RK Gupta, managing director at Taurus Asset Management, which owns TCS shares. tata tata consultancy services Tata Sons tcs Recommended For You World RecordSubstitute Bangladesh Wicketkeeper Imrul Kayes Sets World Record Complete List62nd Jio Filmfare Awards: Aamir's Dangal, Alia Bhatt Win Top Honours wedding bellsYogeshwar Dutt's Golden Gesture, Accepts Re 1 as Dowry MUFC vs LFCZlatan Ibrahimovic Rescues Manchester United in Liverpool Draw Powerful!Ashamed to be Nominated For Baaghi: Amaal Mallik Slams Indian Award Shows From Our Network NAC files show how Sonia-led elitists eroded PMO primacy and undermined the Constitution- FirstPost Trump accepts US intelligence on Russia hacking, says top aide- FirstPost Research in India Part 1: Local solutions needed to deal with unique problems- FirstPost About Us Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap Complaint Redressal Advertise With Us sections India Lifestyle States Tech Politics Auto Sports iVideos Football Power Circuit Latest News Amitabh Bachchan Is Not Heading to Hollywood Anytime Soon My Fashion Sense Was Quite Outrageous: Kangana Ranaut David Guetta Performs In Mumbai, Says We Deserve This Party Cold Wave May Raise Health Issues in Elderly, Children Shazia Hussain Tells How Fruits Can Enhance Beauty Watch LIVE From Network18 News18 India CricketNext News18 States Pradesh18 Bangla News Gujarati News Urdu News Marathi News Topper Moneycontrol Firstpost CompareIndia History India MTV India In.com Burrp CNN name, logo and all associated elements ® and © 2016 Cable News Network LP, LLLP.

"Investors were more confident about Chandra," said a fund manager at a local mutual fund, which owns shares in TCS. "In a tough time when volume growth is elusive, you want someone with a proven track record and it would been preferable to have someone from the business side." Chandrasekaran has been replaced at TCS by Rajesh Gopinathan, described by analysts and insiders as a meticulous operations man. Fund managers fret, however, over the vision for the IT services firm, at a time when it needs to tackle slowing growth in the industry and a problematic period ahead. From an incoming Donald Trump administration in the United States, determined to clamp down on visas vital to the smooth operations of IT services companies in their biggest market, to the still unravelling fallout from Britain's move to bow out of the European Union, TCS will face one of its most complex years. Some also fear that Chandra will have little opportunity to lavish attention on TCS in the new role, as he will be saddled with untying the Gordian knot of Tata Sons politics, and also overseeing 200 group companies - all against the background of a bitter ongoing spat with its ousted chairman Cyrus Mistry. Mistry has publicly detailed the complex array of problems the conglomerate faces from its troubled European steel segment, from ethical concerns to allegations of fraudulent transactions at its Air Asia India joint-venture, and a host of other issues. ROCKING THE BOAT Chandra, who joined the Tata group in 1987, rose through the ranks to become TCS CEO in 2009. Under his leadership, TCS revenue has risen almost fourfold and its workforce has almost tripled. TCS has fared better than rivals Infosys and Wipro . This is despite a rapidly evolving landscape that has forced IT services players to rethink some increasingly commoditised services and innovate with offerings such as automation and artificial intelligence to win clients and boost revenue. The size of TCS has long been its strength, but the changes in the industry mean its size could also become a challenge. "In a time marked with multiple challenges and key headwinds impacting the IT sector, this is not an apt moment to rock the boat for TCS," said Reliance Securities analyst Harit Shah, adding that Chandra's relationships will be missed. TCS has more than tripled the number of its $100 million plus accounts in the last six years to 34 from 10, according to data from JPMorgan. Over that same period, Infosys has only grown that customer base to 18 from 11. Its stock has also vastly outperformed both Infosys and its third-largest Indian rival, Wipro, in that same period. Inside the company, executives at the 350,000-strong firm are more confident, describing the new TCS chief, Gopinathan, as "hands-on". ""Chandra will be at the helm and he will continue to guide the new CEO," said RK Gupta, managing director at Taurus Asset Management, which owns TCS shares.
