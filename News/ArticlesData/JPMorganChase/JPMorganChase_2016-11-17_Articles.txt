Hernan Arbizu, who became involved in a tax-evasion probe involving JPMorgan, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to charges including wire fraud and embezzlement. He was extradited in June from Argentina. "I knew what I was doing was wrong," he said in court. "I'm very sorry and am ashamed by my actions." The 48-year-old citizen of Argentina faces a mandatory-minimum two-year prison sentence and a maximum of 422 years. But under a plea agreement, Arbizu agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, which his lawyer, Guy Lewis, said could help him avoid further prison. What that cooperation entails, Lewis said, "remains to be seen." JPMorgan declined to comment on Friday. Arbizu was first indicted in 2008, the same year he was fired by JPMorgan, where he was a vice president in its private banking division. He worked at UBS from 2002 to 2006. While at JPMorgan, Arbizu oversaw more than $200 million of client assets and was responsible for managing relationships with high-net-worth Argentine customers, according to the bank. Prosecutors said that from March 2007 to April 2008, Arbizu initiated 12 wire transfers from clients at UBS and JPMorgan totaling nearly $5.38 million, about half of which came from a single JPMorgan account. In lawsuits JPMorgan filed against Arbizu in 2008 and 2009, the bank said he wired the $2.8 million to an account at UBS to conceal the millions of dollars that he had previously stolen from one of its customers. JPMorgan said that after it discovered evidence of the wire transfers, Arbizu, then living in Connecticut, fled to Argentina, taking with him confidential data on clients. That data later became the basis of a tax evasion investigation and raid by Argentina authorities of JPMorgan's office in Buenos Aires in 2008 after Arbizu handed over a list of customers. No case against JPMorgan appears to have resulted. The case is U.S. v. Arbizu, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 08-cr-615.

After having just been awarded a multibillion-dollar settlement stemming from the financial crisis, the investment giant launched the hashtag (hash)AskJPM for people to ask career advice questions. But the move badly underestimated consumer sentiment toward banks and showed a tone of deafness to how social media works. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File)(Credit: AP) JP Morgan Chase has agreed to pay a fine $264 million in response to claims that it hired unqualified Chinese employees because they were the children of officials from whom the bank hopes to obtain business. In a scheme that the Department of Justice described as “bribery by any other name” and a threat to national security, JP Morgan Chase is alleged to have hired roughly 100 interns and full-time employees because foreign government officials requested that they do so. In return, JP Morgan Chase received business that earned them more than $100 million. These actions violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits American companies from paying officials in foreign governments to secure business. Although JP Morgan Chase rewarded foreign officials by employing their loved ones instead of directly paying them, the Justice Department effectively argued that this still constituted bribery, particularly because there were many cases in which the unqualified candidate was hired due to a pre-existing understanding that the bank would be awarded business in return. In order to settle, JP Morgan Chase will have to pay $130 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission, $72 million to the Justice Department, and $61.9 million to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. The JP Morgan Chase settlement is particularly important given that Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan Chase, is on President-elect Donald Trump’s short list for secretary of treasury (a position for which Dimon has repeatedly claimed to have no interest). Other close Trump advisers include Wall Street insiders like former Goldman Sachs executive Steve Mnuchin, who also served as finance chair of Trump’s presidential campaign, and Jeb Hensarling, who has ties to the payday loan industry.       Matthew Rozsa is a Ph.D. student in history at Lehigh University and a political columnist.

Among them was a 4.8-magnitude earthquake in January 2016 that's is probably the strongest fracking-induced earthquake ever. The researchers found two main causes from the quakes: pressure increases from injections of chemically laden water designed to pry oil and gas from rock formations; and pressure changes from fracking chemicals that remain after the process releases the hydrocarbons. These latter events can last for months. • Ivanka sat in on Trump’s meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Abe. • JPMorgan’s “systemic bribery” in China so blatant that an internal spreadsheet kept track of it:  JPMorgan Chase will pay more than $130 million in a corruption settlement because it bribed government officials in China by hiring their relatives, according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission. In a three-year investigation, the SEC discovered that JPMorgan engaged knew they were violating the law because they had an internal spread sheet documenting the bribery. • Marilyn Monroe’s dress worn when she sang Happy Birthday to JFK sells for $4.8 million.

Cobell grew up in the 1950s on the Blackfeet reservation of northern Montana without running water, electricity or other amenities. A rancher, Cobell won a 15-year battle in the courts of government mismanagement of oil and gas leases on the Indian trust land that makes up the reservation. Tribal money went missing and wound up in government hands. That fight ended in 2012 with a $3.4 billion award.  “She was the most deserving, as far as I’m concerned,” said Cobell’s sister, Julene Pepion Kennerly of Browning. “She didn’t do it for herself. I always remind people it isn’t about the money, it’s about justice. That was her main goal, that there would be justice for all Native American people.” • While the Dakota Access Pipeline is on hold, three other pipelines are making headway: And each has its environmental threats. There is the The Trans Mountain Expansion Pipeline, Alberta and British Columbia, which threatens an endangered orca population. And there iare the Trans-Pecos Pipeline and Comanche Trail Pipeline in Texas, which present an environmental risk to Big Bend wildlands. The latter two have already been approved by President Obama.  • On today’s Kagro in the Morning show: Trump’s cabinet arrives in Crazy Town.

Since Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed 500- and 1,000-rupee notes from circulation, currency exchange providers in the U.S. have been unable to take the outlawed bills. Some of the country’s biggest banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., work with vendors to provide rupees to clients and those vendors have made the bills unavailable, spokesmen for the banks said. Wells Fargo & Co. also said it can’t supply rupees at this time, while Bank of America Corp. said it has never accepted the currency for exchange. “If you have a euro, you can go to a bank and exchange it,” Desai, 76, of Cliffside Park, New Jersey, said in a telephone interview. “For an Indian rupee, I don’t think there’s any bank that does that here.” Read more: India Withdraws High-Denomination Bills in Graft Crackdown Five-hundred rupee ($7.34) and 1,000-rupee notes ceased to be legal tender Nov. 9, Modi said last week in a surprise announcement, sweeping away 86 percent of the total currency in circulation. The move has been seen as an attempt to fulfill his election promise of curbing tax evasion and recovering illegal income, locally known as black money, stashed overseas. The notes will have to be deposited in banks by the end of December, Modi said. ‘Cash-based Economy’ “For our clients, it’s very hard,” Nandita Chandra, head of Great Indian Travel Co.’s New York office, said in a telephone interview while visiting New Delhi. “A lot of people are affected and we don’t have a culture that is credit-card friendly, it’s a cash-based economy." Read more: Modi put a target on tax evaders on his first day in office. Mastercard Inc., the second-largest payment network, heralded the move as one that will reduce crime and drive growth in the Indian economy. Modi’s “bold action and leadership is a critical step in positioning India to be a leader in the global cashless and digital economy movement,” Porush Singh, the firm’s president for South Asia, said in a statement. “Mastercard is committed to working with the government to provide the cashless solutions that combat corruption and create growth, and inclusion for all members of society.” Travelex Ltd., which operates more than 200 currency exchange stores in the U.S., said it’s unable to accept the 500- and 1000-rupee bills from customers because it can’t repatriate the cash in bulk under India’s current rules, said Lucie Smith, a spokeswoman for the London-based company. Western Union Co., the world’s largest money-transfer service, said for those locations facing a shortage of rupees, customers are able to receive checks or remittances to their bank accounts. “A lot of people are trying to give money to their friends to spend it, or else it will go to waste,” said Desai, who makes a yearly trip to India to work at a medical camp. If she can’t find a place to exchange or use the bills, she’ll “just have to throw it away.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Here, we’ll instead look at a Trump discount, meaning a stock that has been clobbered since Election Day on the belief that U.S. policy changes will be bad for business in South Korea. Kia Motors (ticker: 000270.KR), down 30% so far this year and 12% since Election Day, trades at just 4.9 times this year’s projected earnings. More than half the company’s stock value is attributable to land, buildings and net cash. That means the car-making business...

Tonight Mostly clear. Low 26F. Winds light and variable. Updated: November 20, 2016 @ 11:15 am Full Forecast News Sports Business Photos Obits Classifieds AP Business Highlights By The Associated Press Updated Nov 17, 2016 ___ Yellen says she isn't going anywhere when Trump takes office WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen appears unruffled by incoming President Donald Trump's victory last week. Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends on Feb. 3, 2018, reiterated the Fed's political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress' Joint Economic Committee. ___ America's shift to SUVs is on display at L.A. Auto Show America's shift from cars to SUVs is starting to look permanent, and automakers are scrambling to meet the demand. Toyota, Ford, Subaru, Jeep and Volkswagen are all showing new SUVs at this week's Los Angeles Auto Show. Even traditional luxury car makers like Jaguar and Alfa Romeo are debuting SUVs. Americans bought more SUVs than four-door cars for the first time last year, and the momentum is growing. But unlike the previous SUV boom, which fell victim to rising gas prices, this one is likely to stay as automakers offer more small SUVs with better fuel economy. ___ Ex-Valeant, Philidor execs arrested for fraud, conspiracy Former executives of Valeant Pharmaceuticals and a related mail-order pharmacy were charged Thursday with running a fraud-and-kickback scheme that bilked Valeant out of millions of dollars. Their arrests are part of an ongoing investigation, according to Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who said other arrests are possible. Bharara's office said it has charged Gary Tanner, a former Valeant executive, and Andrew Davenport, who had been the chief executive of Philidor, a mail-order pharmacy that is now defunct, with two counts of wire fraud, along with money laundering and conspiracy. ___ Bank stocks surge again, leading broader market higher NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose Thursday as banks resumed their steep upward climb and retailers moved higher. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen emphasized that the Fed plans to raise interest rates, which will help banks make more money from lending. Stocks started the day with small gains and moved higher following Yellen's testimony to Congress. Banks once again marched higher as investors cheered the latest indication that interest rates will rise from their current ultra-low levels. Retailers also rose after strong earnings from Best Buy, while food and household goods makers struggled after weak results from Wal-Mart and J.M. Smucker. ___ Wal-Mart's profit falls but beats estimates; revenue misses NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. saw its third-quarter profit fall more than 8 percent, dragged down as it continues to plow money into e-commerce and improving its stores. While online sales improved, overall revenue fell short of expectations as the company said it was hurt in part by falling food prices. Profit at the world's largest retailer still beat Wall Street expectations, and it lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast. Investors focused on the sales, though, sending shares in the retailer down. ___ Gap's third-quarter profit drops nearly 18 percent NEW YORK (AP) — Gap's third-quarter profit fell nearly 18 percent, undercut by costs related to store closures outside North America. Gap Inc. shares fell in after-market trading Thursday as the company said the slump in the number of people visiting its stores continues as it heads into the critical holiday shopping season. Gap is facing the same problems as other fashion retailers, with shoppers buying less clothing in general and also favoring off-price chains like T.J. Maxx. But Gap is also struggling with identity problems, mired in a slump as its fashions just don't stand out in an overcrowded landscape. ___ JPMorgan Chase to pay $264 million in Chinese bribery case NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. has agreed to pay $264.4 million in fines to federal authorities to settle criminal and civil charges that it hired friends and relatives of Chinese officials in order to gain access to banking deals in that country. JPMorgan's Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo program that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of the person's qualifications, in order to gain favor and win banking deals. ___ Tesla, SolarCity get shareholder approval for merger Tesla Motors got approval from investors to combine with SolarCity Corp. in an effort to expand the market for solar power and give electric car owners new options for solar charging. Shareholders of both companies backed the merger by a wide margin Thursday. The deal, first proposed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk proposed in June, has had more of a mixed reaction on Wall Street. Analysts wondered why Tesla would want to take on SolarCity while busy with its own goals. There were also complaints of a conflict of interest for Musk, who is chairman of both companies. ___ Wells Fargo sees significant slowdown in account openings NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo disclosed signs on Thursday that its customers are significantly pulling back from doing business with the bank, a reverberation of the sales practices scandal that drew a huge fine in September. Because of the timing, its data for October is the first full-picture view of customer reaction and it is not pretty. New customer account openings fell 44 percent in October from a year earlier, while account closures rose 3 percent from the previous year.

In a memo to employees, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong says the Verizon-owned company has added 1,500 employees over the past year because of acquisitions and partnerships, and it needs to consolidate to improve operations. Armstrong says AOL will add jobs in the areas that are driving growth. ___ Sorry Trump, NY Times says subscriptions rose since election NEW YORK (AP) — The New York Times pushed back against President-elect Donald Trump, saying Thursday that its paid subscriptions have jumped since the election, despite Trump's accusations. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that the Times "is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the 'Trump phenomena.'" The Times said Thursday that it added 41,000 paid subscriptions to its newspaper and digital news products in the week since Election Day. The increase is its largest one-week rise since 2011, when it launched its digital subscription model. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average added 35.68 points, or 0.2 percent, to close at 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 10.18 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 39.39 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,333.97. Benchmark U.S. crude slid 15 cents to $45.42 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, slipped 14 cents to $46.49 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline rose 2 cents to $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil rose 1 cent to $1.45 a gallon. Natural gas fell 6 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.70 per 1,000 cubic feet. ___ The first item has been corrected to read that Yellen's term ends on Feb. 3, 2018, not January 2018.

(NYSE: JPM) has agreed to pay over $130 million to settle charges that it won business from clients and corruptly influenced government officials in the Asia-Pacific region by giving jobs and internships to their relatives and friends in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). As a result, JPMorgan also is expected to pay $72 million to the Justice Department and $61.9 million to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors for a total of more than $264 million in sanctions resulting from the firm’s referral hiring practices. According to the agency’s report, investment bankers at JPMorgan’s subsidiary in Asia created a client referral hiring program that bypassed the firm’s normal hiring process and rewarded job candidates referred by client executives and influential government officials with well-paying, career-building JPMorgan employment. During a seven-year period, JPMorgan hired roughly 100 interns and full-time employees at the request of foreign government officials, enabling the firm to win or retain business resulting in more than $100 million in revenues to JPMorgan. The SEC’s report found that JPMorgan violated the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. JPMorgan has agreed to pay $105.51 million in disgorgement plus $25.08 million in interest to settle the SEC’s case. The SEC considered the company’s remedial acts and its cooperation with the investigation when determining the settlement. Andrew J. Ceresney, Director of the SEC Enforcement Division, commented: JPMorgan engaged in a systematic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials and other favored referrals who were typically unqualified for the positions on their own merit. JPMorgan employees knew the firm was potentially violating the FCPA yet persisted with the improper hiring program because the business rewards and new deals were deemed too lucrative. Kara Brockmeyer, Chief of the SEC Enforcement Division’s FCPA Unit, added: The misconduct was so blatant that JPMorgan investment bankers created ‘Referral Hires vs Revenue’ spreadsheets to track the money flow from clients whose referrals were rewarded with jobs.  The firm’s internal controls were so weak that not a single referral hire request was denied. Shares of JPMorgan were last trading up 1% at $78.25, with a consensus analyst price target of $74.24 and a 52-week trading range of $52.50 to $80.44.

Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends on Feb. 3, 2018, reiterated the Fed’s political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress’ Joint Economic Committee. ___ America’s shift to SUVs is on display at L.A. Auto Show America’s shift from cars to SUVs is starting to look permanent, and automakers are scrambling to meet the demand. Toyota, Ford, Subaru, Jeep and Volkswagen are all showing new SUVs at this week’s Los Angeles Auto Show. Even traditional luxury car makers like Jaguar and Alfa Romeo are debuting SUVs. Americans bought more SUVs than four-door cars for the first time last year, and the momentum is growing. But unlike the previous SUV boom, which fell victim to rising gas prices, this one is likely to stay as automakers offer more small SUVs with better fuel economy. ___ Ex-Valeant, Philidor execs arrested for fraud, conspiracy Former executives of Valeant Pharmaceuticals and a related mail-order pharmacy were charged Thursday with running a fraud-and-kickback scheme that bilked Valeant out of millions of dollars. Their arrests are part of an ongoing investigation, according to Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who said other arrests are possible. Bharara’s office said it has charged Gary Tanner, a former Valeant executive, and Andrew Davenport, who had been the chief executive of Philidor, a mail-order pharmacy that is now defunct, with two counts of wire fraud, along with money laundering and conspiracy. ___ Bank stocks surge again, leading broader market higher NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose Thursday as banks resumed their steep upward climb and retailers moved higher. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen emphasized that the Fed plans to raise interest rates, which will help banks make more money from lending. Stocks started the day with small gains and moved higher following Yellen’s testimony to Congress. Banks once again marched higher as investors cheered the latest indication that interest rates will rise from their current ultra-low levels. Retailers also rose after strong earnings from Best Buy, while food and household goods makers struggled after weak results from Wal-Mart and J.M. Smucker. ___ Wal-Mart’s profit falls but beats estimates; revenue misses NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. saw its third-quarter profit fall more than 8 per cent, dragged down as it continues to plow money into e-commerce and improving its stores. While online sales improved, overall revenue fell short of expectations as the company said it was hurt in part by falling food prices. Profit at the world’s largest retailer still beat Wall Street expectations, and it lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast. Investors focused on the sales, though, sending shares in the retailer down. ___ Gap’s third-quarter profit drops nearly 18 per cent NEW YORK (AP) — Gap’s third-quarter profit fell nearly 18 per cent, undercut by costs related to store closures outside North America. Gap Inc. shares fell in after-market trading Thursday as the company said the slump in the number of people visiting its stores continues as it heads into the critical holiday shopping season. Gap is facing the same problems as other fashion retailers, with shoppers buying less clothing in general and also favouring off-price chains like T.J. Maxx. But Gap is also struggling with identity problems, mired in a slump as its fashions just don’t stand out in an overcrowded landscape. ___ JPMorgan Chase to pay $264 million in Chinese bribery case NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. has agreed to pay $264.4 million in fines to federal authorities to settle criminal and civil charges that it hired friends and relatives of Chinese officials in order to gain access to banking deals in that country. JPMorgan’s Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo program that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of the person’s qualifications, in order to gain favour and win banking deals. ___ Tesla, SolarCity get shareholder approval for merger Tesla Motors got approval from investors to combine with SolarCity Corp. in an effort to expand the market for solar power and give electric car owners new options for solar charging. Shareholders of both companies backed the merger by a wide margin Thursday. The deal, first proposed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk proposed in June, has had more of a mixed reaction on Wall Street. Analysts wondered why Tesla would want to take on SolarCity while busy with its own goals. There were also complaints of a conflict of interest for Musk, who is chairman of both companies. ___ Wells Fargo sees significant slowdown in account openings NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo disclosed signs on Thursday that its customers are significantly pulling back from doing business with the bank, a reverberation of the sales practices scandal that drew a huge fine in September. Because of the timing, its data for October is the first full-picture view of customer reaction and it is not pretty. New customer account openings fell 44 per cent in October from a year earlier, while account closures rose 3 per cent from the previous year.

The increase is its largest one-week rise since 2011, when it launched its digital subscription model. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average added 35.68 points, or 0.2 per cent, to close at 18,903.82. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rose 10.18 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,187.12. The Nasdaq composite added 39.39 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 5,333.97.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad Business Highlights By Associated Press Published: 19:44 EST, 17 November 2016 | Updated: 19:44 EST, 17 November 2016 e-mail ___ Yellen says she isn't going anywhere when Trump takes office WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen appears unruffled by incoming President Donald Trump's victory last week. Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends on Feb. 3, 2018, reiterated the Fed's political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress' Joint Economic Committee. ___ America's shift to SUVs is on display at L.A. Auto Show America's shift from cars to SUVs is starting to look permanent, and automakers are scrambling to meet the demand. Toyota, Ford, Subaru, Jeep and Volkswagen are all showing new SUVs at this week's Los Angeles Auto Show. Even traditional luxury car makers like Jaguar and Alfa Romeo are debuting SUVs. Americans bought more SUVs than four-door cars for the first time last year, and the momentum is growing. But unlike the previous SUV boom, which fell victim to rising gas prices, this one is likely to stay as automakers offer more small SUVs with better fuel economy. ___ Ex-Valeant, Philidor execs arrested for fraud, conspiracy Former executives of Valeant Pharmaceuticals and a related mail-order pharmacy were charged Thursday with running a fraud-and-kickback scheme that bilked Valeant out of millions of dollars. Their arrests are part of an ongoing investigation, according to Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who said other arrests are possible. Bharara's office said it has charged Gary Tanner, a former Valeant executive, and Andrew Davenport, who had been the chief executive of Philidor, a mail-order pharmacy that is now defunct, with two counts of wire fraud, along with money laundering and conspiracy. ___ Bank stocks surge again, leading broader market higher NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose Thursday as banks resumed their steep upward climb and retailers moved higher. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen emphasized that the Fed plans to raise interest rates, which will help banks make more money from lending. Stocks started the day with small gains and moved higher following Yellen's testimony to Congress. Banks once again marched higher as investors cheered the latest indication that interest rates will rise from their current ultra-low levels. Retailers also rose after strong earnings from Best Buy, while food and household goods makers struggled after weak results from Wal-Mart and J.M. Smucker. ___ Wal-Mart's profit falls but beats estimates; revenue misses NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. saw its third-quarter profit fall more than 8 percent, dragged down as it continues to plow money into e-commerce and improving its stores. While online sales improved, overall revenue fell short of expectations as the company said it was hurt in part by falling food prices. Profit at the world's largest retailer still beat Wall Street expectations, and it lifted the bottom end of its full-year profit forecast. Investors focused on the sales, though, sending shares in the retailer down. ___ Gap's third-quarter profit drops nearly 18 percent NEW YORK (AP) — Gap's third-quarter profit fell nearly 18 percent, undercut by costs related to store closures outside North America. Gap Inc. shares fell in after-market trading Thursday as the company said the slump in the number of people visiting its stores continues as it heads into the critical holiday shopping season. Gap is facing the same problems as other fashion retailers, with shoppers buying less clothing in general and also favoring off-price chains like T.J. Maxx. But Gap is also struggling with identity problems, mired in a slump as its fashions just don't stand out in an overcrowded landscape. ___ JPMorgan Chase to pay $264 million in Chinese bribery case NEW YORK (AP) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. has agreed to pay $264.4 million in fines to federal authorities to settle criminal and civil charges that it hired friends and relatives of Chinese officials in order to gain access to banking deals in that country. JPMorgan's Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo program that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of the person's qualifications, in order to gain favor and win banking deals. ___ Tesla, SolarCity get shareholder approval for merger Tesla Motors got approval from investors to combine with SolarCity Corp. in an effort to expand the market for solar power and give electric car owners new options for solar charging. Shareholders of both companies backed the merger by a wide margin Thursday. The deal, first proposed by Tesla CEO Elon Musk proposed in June, has had more of a mixed reaction on Wall Street. Analysts wondered why Tesla would want to take on SolarCity while busy with its own goals. There were also complaints of a conflict of interest for Musk, who is chairman of both companies. ___ Wells Fargo sees significant slowdown in account openings NEW YORK (AP) — Wells Fargo disclosed signs on Thursday that its customers are significantly pulling back from doing business with the bank, a reverberation of the sales practices scandal that drew a huge fine in September. Because of the timing, its data for October is the first full-picture view of customer reaction and it is not pretty. New customer account openings fell 44 percent in October from a year earlier, while account closures rose 3 percent from the previous year. The bank saw a 50 percent drop in credit card applications. ___ Verizon's AOL cutting 500 jobs, will focus on mobile, video NEW YORK (AP) — AOL is cutting about 500 jobs, or 8 percent of its workforce, as it trims back following some deals and focuses on mobile, video and data. In a memo to employees, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong says the Verizon-owned company has added 1,500 employees over the past year because of acquisitions and partnerships, and it needs to consolidate to improve operations.

(REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A WASHINGTON: JP Morgan Chase has agreed to pay US$264 million to settle a foreign bribery case dubbed the "princelings case" in which the bank gave prized jobs to friends and relatives of Chinese officials, US officials announced on Thursday (Nov 17). The multinational bank, now the world's largest by market capitalisation, admitted to taking in more than US$100 million after hiring candidates referred by clients, including by senior Chinese officials in positions to steer business to the bank. Despite the announcement, shares in the JP Morgan were trading higher on Thursday afternoon, up 0.6 per cent shortly after 2000 GMT in New York. "Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple," Leslie Caldwell, chief of the US Justice Department's criminal division, said in a statement. The case drew attention for its focus on the use of hiring as a form of bribery. Over a seven-year period, between 2006 and 2013, JP Morgan Chase hired nearly 100 employees and interns referred by government officials at 20 different state-owned businesses in China, officials said. Despite the large settlement, Bart Naylor of policy watchdog group Public Citizen, complained that the bank "has escaped true accountability" "JPMorgan executives belong in jail, but instead shareholders will foot the bill for what one government official described as 'systemic bribery,'" he said in a statement. 'SONS AND DAUGHTERS PROGRAMME' Officials at a regional subsidiary in Hong Kong created a client job referral program sometimes known internally as the "Sons and Daughters Programme" to hire candidates of strategic value to the bank, according to the Justice Department. By 2009, senior executives had refined the program to seek candidates with "directly attributable linkage to business opportunity," federal prosecutors said, citing internal JP Morgan Chase records. In one example, JP Morgan won a leading role in the initial public offering for an unnamed state-owned Chinese company after hiring a candidate who bank executives knew was unqualified, for a job in New York. The candidate had been referred in 2009 by a senior Chinese official who promised the business in return for the hire. Candidates hired in this program typically received salaries equivalent to entry-level investment bankers despite performing mainly minor tasks such as proof-reeding, according to the Justice Department. NO CRIMINAL CHARGES Authorities brought no criminal charges against the bank as part of the settlement and took no enforcement action against individuals. However, a JP Morgan Chase subsidiary in Hong Kong fired six employees and disciplined 23 others for their roles in the misconduct, the Justice Department said. In the settlement, JP Morgan Chase agreed to pay US$134 million in fines to the Justice Department and Federal Reserve, as well as another US$130 million in to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Since 1977, the United States has criminalised the practice bribing foreign officials to win business under a Watergate-era statute known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Other countries have adopted similar laws but none enforces it as aggressively as the United States. US enforcement of the law has broadened in recent years, with authorities in Washington extending their reach to more industries and scrutinising a greater range of business practices for corruption. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Authorities now describe it as "corruption, plain and simple." JPMorgan Chase (JPM) improperly hired the "unqualified" children of China's ruling elite to win lucrative business from the country's key decision makers, authorities alleged on Thursday. Regulators slapped JPMorgan with $264 million in fines and said the bank "corruptly influenced government officials" with its hiring and internship tactics in China. The settlement follows a three-year investigation into JPMorgan and marks one of the first major crackdowns on a big U.S. bank for running afoul of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Known as the FCPA, the law prohibits companies from making payments or giving "anything of value" to win business from foreign officials. "JPMorgan engaged in a systemic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials ... who were typically unqualified for the position on their own merit," Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement. The practice of giving the children of China's ruling class plum jobs and internships was so common at JPMorgan that the bank even had a formal program known as "Sons and Daughters."

"The so-called Sons and Daughters program was nothing more than bribery by another name," said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Leslie Caldwell. She called it "corruption, plain and simple." Related: Wells Fargo account openings plunge 44% Over the course of seven years, JPMorgan hired about 100 interns and full-time employees at the request of foreign government officials, according to authorities. These jobs scored JPMorgan more than $100 million in business. JPMorgan admitted to authorities that individuals hired during the scheme were given the same titles and paid the same amount as entry-level investment bankers. That's despite the fact that, according to the DOJ, they mostly focused on routine work such as "proofreading" and generated little actual business.

The bank has agreed to pay more than $130 million to the SEC, $72 million to the Justice Department and $62 million to the Federal Reserve. Despite the "blatant" conduct alleged by authorities, the U.S. did not announce any criminal charges against JPMorgan itself nor any individual employees of the bank. In a statement, JPMorgan said the hiring practices were "unacceptable" and the program was stopped in 2013. The bank said it took "action" against the individuals involved and has since improved its hiring procedures. JPMorgan also said in a filing that it continues to cooperate on other related investigations that are "ongoing." The SEC said it continues to investigate the issue. Authorities say the hirings were quid pro quo arrangements expressly made with the intent to win business. For instance, the DOJ said that in late 2009 a Chinese official told a senior JPMorgan banker in Asia that hiring a referred candidate would significantly influence the role JPMorgan would play in an upcoming IPO of a Chinese state-owned company. JPMorgan then spent months trying to place the candidate in a New York investment banking position -- despite realizing he was not qualified. The SEC said JPMorgan's internal controls were "so weak" that not one of these hiring requests was denied.

Authorities now describe it as “corruption, plain and simple.” JPMorgan Chase improperly hired the “unqualified” children of China’s ruling elite to win lucrative business from the country’s key decision makers, authorities alleged on Thursday. Regulators slapped JPMorgan with $264 million in fines and said the bank “corruptly influenced government officials” with its hiring and internship tactics in China. The settlement follows a three-year investigation into JPMorgan and marks one of the first major crackdowns on a big U.S. bank for running afoul of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Known as the FCPA, the law prohibits companies from making payments or giving “anything of value” to win business from foreign officials. “JPMorgan engaged in a systemic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials … who were typically unqualified for the position on their own merit,” Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC’s enforcement division, said in a statement. The practice of giving the children of China’s ruling class plum jobs and internships was so common at JPMorgan that the bank even had a formal program known as “Sons and Daughters.” The program included spreadsheets that tracked how often the hires turned into business deals. “The so-called Sons and Daughters program was nothing more than bribery by another name,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Leslie Caldwell. She called it “corruption, plain and simple.” Over the course of seven years, JPMorgan hired about 100 interns and full-time employees at the request of foreign government officials, according to authorities.

The SEC and Justice Department had been investigating over several years whether some of JPMorgan's hiring efforts involved bribes, in violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The SEC will receive $130 million of the settlement, with $72 million going to Justice and $61.9 million to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which penalized the bank "for unsafe and unsound practices." JPMorgan did not admit or deny the charges. As part of its settlement with the Justice Department, a Hong Kong unit of the bank admitted to making quid pro quo hiring agreements with Chinese officials to win investment business. JPMorgan is the first major bank to settle a case over the hiring of "princelings," as the offspring and other relatives of top Chinese officials are popularly known. In recent years, several other banks, including HSBC and Goldman Sachs, have said their hiring practices in Asia were under scrutiny by U.S. authorities. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it a crime to bribe overseas officials to win business, even if the payments are non-monetary. A JPMorgan spokesman said in an email: "The conduct was unacceptable." The hiring program was halted in 2013 and the bank took actions against those responsible, the spokesman said. Authorities said JPMorgan's Asia unit created an elaborate program, called "Sons and Daughters," that allowed clients and influential government officials to recommend potential hires. Those candidates received preferential treatment, bypassing JPMorgan's normal recruitment practices, the SEC said. Between 2006 and 2013, JPMorgan hired around 200 interns and full-term employees at the request of its Asia clients, as well as Chinese officials at state-owned companies. Those state-owned companies brought JPMorgan more than $100 million in revenue, the SEC said. For example, in urging the hiring of one candidate, a JPMorgan banker said, "It will strengthen our relationship" with a client and solidify "our position as an advisor to him and the IPOs of his companies (expected to be >$500mm in offering size," according to SEC's order. Quid pro quo business arrangements remain an entrenched part of business culture in China that is very hard to avoid, said Alex Bourelly, who leads the SEC enforcement practice at the law firm Baker Botts LLP. Local staff members who have many government contacts know they can be quickly hired elsewhere if they are caught and fired for making improper payments, Bourelly said. "U.S. law has its limits in terms of how it can affect the behavior of people around the world," he said.

Authorities now describe it as "corruption, plain and simple." JPMorgan Chase (JPM) improperly hired the "unqualified" children of China's ruling elite to win lucrative business from the country's key decision makers, authorities alleged on Thursday. Regulators slapped JPMorgan with $264 million in fines and said the bank "corruptly influenced government officials" with its hiring and internship tactics in China. The settlement follows a three-year investigation into JPMorgan and marks one of the first major crackdowns on a big U.S. bank for running afoul of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Known as the FCPA, the law prohibits companies from making payments or giving "anything of value" to win business from foreign officials. "JPMorgan engaged in a systemic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials ... who were typically unqualified for the position on their own merit," Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement. The practice of giving the children of China's ruling class plum jobs and internships was so common at JPMorgan that the bank even had a formal program known as "Sons and Daughters." The program included spreadsheets that tracked how often the hires turned into business deals. "The so-called Sons and Daughters program was nothing more than bribery by another name," said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Leslie Caldwell. She called it "corruption, plain and simple." Related: Wells Fargo account openings plunge 44% Over the course of seven years, JPMorgan hired about 100 interns and full-time employees at the request of foreign government officials, according to authorities. These jobs scored JPMorgan more than $100 million in business. JPMorgan admitted to authorities that individuals hired during the scheme were given the same titles and paid the same amount as entry-level investment bankers. That's despite the fact that, according to the DOJ, they mostly focused on routine work such as "proofreading" and generated little actual business. JPMorgan's $264 million in fines is being divided up among multiple government agencies. The bank has agreed to pay more than $130 million to the SEC, $72 million to the Justice Department and $62 million to the Federal Reserve. Despite the "blatant" conduct alleged by authorities, the U.S. did not announce any criminal charges against JPMorgan itself nor any individual employees of the bank. In a statement, JPMorgan said the hiring practices were "unacceptable" and the program was stopped in 2013. The bank said it took "action" against the individuals involved and has since improved its hiring procedures. JPMorgan also said in a filing that it continues to cooperate on other related investigations that are "ongoing." The SEC said it continues to investigate the issue. Authorities say the hirings were quid pro quo arrangements expressly made with the intent to win business. For instance, the DOJ said that in late 2009 a Chinese official told a senior JPMorgan banker in Asia that hiring a referred candidate would significantly influence the role JPMorgan would play in an upcoming IPO of a Chinese state-owned company. JPMorgan then spent months trying to place the candidate in a New York investment banking position -- despite realizing he was not qualified. The SEC said JPMorgan's internal controls were "so weak" that not one of these hiring requests was denied. Related: Sign up for CNNMoney's morning market newsletter: Before The Bell The settlement comes as JPMorgan's CEO, Jamie Dimon, has been floated as a potential treasury secretary in the Trump administration. It's also the latest black eye for Wall Street and big banks. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo (WFC) outraged Americans by saying it fired 5,300 employees for creating as many as 2 million fake accounts. The scandal dealt a blow to Wells Fargo's reputation and resulted in the sudden retirement of longtime CEO John Stumpf. JPMorgan itself has also been in trouble in recent years. In 2013, JPMorgan paid $5.1 billion to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac linked to misdeeds in the run up to the housing bubble. JPMorgan was also hit with a $1 billion fine for improper oversight that led to the London Whale trading debacle. Regulators worry the misbehavior among bankers is causing a credibility problem for the industry. "Deep-seated cultural and ethical problems," New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley recently warned," have "eroded the industry's trustworthiness."

 'BLINK BLINK, NOD NOD': Highlights from the JPMorgan bribery case Portia Crowe Nov. 17, 2016, 1:10 PM 8,028 facebook linkedin twitter email print REUTERS/Neil Hall JPMorgan on Thursday agreed to pay more than $264 million to US authorities to settle charges that it bribed officials in the Asia-Pacific region to win business, ending a nearly three-year investigation. The charges alleged that JPMorgan gave jobs and internships to friends and family of corrupt government officials, which would be a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. "During a seven-year period, JPMorgan hired approximately 100 interns and full-time employees at the request of foreign government officials, enabling the firm to win or retain business resulting in more than $100 million in revenues to JPMorgan," the Securities and Exchange Commission wrote in a press release. Following the announcement, the SEC released documents used to argue its case.

(JPMC), agreed to pay a $72 million penalty for its role in a scheme to corruptly gain advantages in winning banking deals by awarding prestigious jobs to relatives and friends of Chinese government officials. Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell of the Criminal Division, U.S. Attorney Robert L. Capers of the Eastern District of New York and Assistant Director in Charge William F. Sweeney Jr. of the FBI’s New York Field Office made the announcement.  “The so-called Sons and Daughters Program was nothing more than bribery by another name,” said Assistant Attorney General Caldwell.  “Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple.  This case demonstrates the Criminal Division’s commitment to uncovering corruption no matter the form of the scheme.” “U.S. businesses cannot lawfully seek to gain a business advantage by corruptly influencing foreign government officials,” said U.S. Attorney Capers.  “The common refrain that this is simply how business is done overseas is no defense.  In this case, JPMorgan employees designed a program to hire otherwise unqualified candidates for prestigious investment banking jobs solely because these candidates were referred to the bank by officials in positions to award business to the bank.  In certain instances, referred candidates were hired with the understanding that the hiring was linked to the award of specific business.  This is no longer business as usual; it is corruption.” “Creating a barter system in which jobs are awarded to applicants in exchange for lucrative business deals is a corrupt scheme in and of itself,” said Assistant Director in Charge Sweeney.  “But when foreign officials are among those involved in the bribe, the international free market system and our national security are among the major threats we face.  Those engaging in these illegal acts abroad may think they're out of sight and out of mind, but they're wrong.  The FBI has recently established three dedicated international corruption squads to combat this type of quid pro quo, and we'll use all resources at our disposal to uncover and put an end to these crimes.” According to JPMorgan APAC’s admissions, beginning in 2006, senior Hong Kong-based investment bankers set up and used a “client referral program,” also referred to as the “Sons and Daughters Program,” to hire candidates referred by clients and government officials.  The Sons and Daughters Program was used as a means to influence those same officials to award investment deals to JPMorgan APAC.  By late 2009, JPMorgan APAC executives and senior bankers revamped the client referral program to improve its efficacy by prioritizing those hires linked to upcoming client transactions.  In order to be hired, a referred candidate had to have a “directly attributable linkage to business opportunity.”  According to admissions made in connection with the resolution, these quid pro quo arrangements were discussed internally among JPMorgan APAC bankers.  For example, in late 2009, a Chinese government official communicated to a senior JPMorgan APAC banker that hiring a referred candidate would significantly influence the role JPMorgan APAC would receive in an upcoming initial public offering (IPO) for a Chinese state-owned company.  The banker communicated this message to several senior colleagues, who then spent several months trying to place the referred candidate in an investment banking position in New York.  Despite learning from personnel in New York that this referred candidate was not qualified for an investment banking position, senior JPMorgan APAC bankers created a new position for the candidate in New York, and JPMorgan APAC thereafter obtained a leading role in the IPO.  Further, JPMorgan APAC employees misused compliance questionnaires to justify and paper over corrupt business arrangements.  Employees also used a template with pre-filled answers, including that there was “no expected benefit” from the hire, and compliance personnel drafted and modified questionnaires that failed to state the true purpose of the hire. JPMorgan APAC further admitted that candidates hired during the scheme were typically given the same titles and paid the same amount as entry-level investment bankers, despite the fact that many of these hires performed ancillary work such as proofreading and provided little real value to any deliverable product.  The corrupt scheme netted JPMorgan APAC at least $35 million in profits from business mandates with Chinese state-owned companies.  JPMorgan APAC entered into a non-prosecution agreement and agreed to pay a criminal penalty of $72 million to resolve the matter.  As part of the agreement, JPMorgan APAC has agreed to continue to cooperate with the department in any ongoing investigations and prosecutions relating to the conduct, including of individuals, to enhance its compliance program, and to report to the department on the implementation of its enhanced compliance program. The department reached this resolution based on a number of factors, including that JPMorgan APAC did not voluntarily and timely disclose the conduct at issue.  However, JPMorgan APAC did receive full credit for its and JPMC’s cooperation with the criminal investigation, including conducting a thorough internal investigation, making foreign-based employees available for interviews in the United States and producing documents to the government from foreign countries in ways that did not implicate foreign data privacy laws.  JPMorgan APAC also took significant employment action against six employees who participated in the misconduct resulting in their departure from the bank, and it disciplined an additional 23 employees who, although not involved in the misconduct, failed to effectively detect the misconduct or supervise those engaged in it.  JPMorgan APAC imposed more than $18.3 million in financial sanctions on former or current employees in connection with the remediation efforts.  Based on these actions and other considerations, the company received a non-prosecution agreement and an aggregate discount of 25 percent off of the bottom of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines fine range.  In related proceedings, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a cease and desist order against JPMC, whereby JPMC agreed to pay $130.5 million in disgorgement to the SEC, including prejudgment interest.  The Federal Reserve System’s Board of Governors also issued a consent cease-and-desist order and assessed a $61.9 million civil penalty. Thus, the combined U.S. criminal and regulatory penalties paid by JPMC and its Hong Kong subsidiary are approximately $264.4 million.  The FBI’s New York Field Office investigated the case.  The department appreciates the significant cooperation and assistance provided by the SEC and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in this matter.  Assistant Deputy Chief Leo Tsao and Trial Attorneys James P. McDonald and Derek J. Ettinger of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney James P. Loonam of the Eastern District of New York’s Business and Securities Fraud Section prosecuted the case.  The Criminal Division’s Fraud Section is responsible for investigating and prosecuting all FCPA matters.  Additional information about the Justice Department’s FCPA enforcement efforts can be found at www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa.   Download JPMorgan Securities Asia Pacific NPA     Back to List Publications Handbook Online Exchange Handbook Trading Places World Exchanges Media & Resources Press Events News FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index Glossary Acronyms White Papers Twitter Legal and About Us About Mondo Visione Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Cookies Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap © Mondo Visione 2016 About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Careers Sitemap Back to Top News RSS Site by Red Ant

By Roger Baird November 17, 2016 16:51 GMT The investigation has sent shockwaves around international banks, because hiring well-connected people for finance jobs is common in ChinaReuters US bank JPMorgan Chase has agreed to pay $264m (£212m) to regulators to settle claims it hired the children of well-connected top Chinese officials to win business. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Justice Department launched an investigation in 2013, into the employment of what has been called "princelings". The regulators said during a seven-year period the bank hired approximately 100 interns and full-time employees "at the request of foreign government officials, enabling the firm to win or retain business resulting in more than $100m in revenues to JPMorgan". The bank's behaviour contravened the 1977 US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which bans firms from paying bribes to overseas officials to win business. Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC enforcement division said: "JPMorgan engaged in a systematic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials and other favoured referrals who were typically unqualified for the positions on their own merit. "JPMorgan employees knew the firm was potentially violating the FCPA yet persisted with the improper hiring program because the business rewards and new deals were deemed too lucrative." The investigation has sent shockwaves around international banks, because hiring well-connected people for finance jobs is common in China, where there is a strong emphasis on guanxi, or personal contacts, in doing business. Further probes The bank will pay the SEC $130m for violations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It is also expected to pay $72m to the US Justice Department and $61.9m to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. JPMorgan engaged in the scheme, which it called the Sons and Daughters Programme, from 2006 until at least 2012, investigators said. Kara Brockmeyer, chief of the SEC enforcement division's FCPA Unit, added: "The misconduct was so blatant that JPMorgan investment bankers created 'Referral Hires vs Revenue' spreadsheets to track the money flow from clients whose referrals were rewarded with jobs. "The firm's internal controls were so weak that not a single referral hire request was denied." The Justice Department is understood to be still investigating at least five other unidentified Wall Street banks to see if they hired relatives of key Chinese officials to win business by gaining influence.

The multinational bank, now the world's largest by market capitalization, admitted to taking in more than $100 million after hiring candidates referred by clients, including by senior Chinese officials in positions to steer business to the bank. Despite the announcement, shares in the JP Morgan were trading higher Thursday afternoon, up 0.6 percent shortly after 2000 GMT in New York. The headquarters of JP Morgan Chase in New York ©Spencer Platt (Getty/AFP/File) "Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple," Leslie Caldwell, chief of the US Justice Department's criminal division, said in a statement. The case drew attention for its focus on the use of hiring as a form of bribery. Over a seven-year period, between 2006 and 2013, JP Morgan Chase hired nearly 100 employees and interns referred by government officials at 20 different state-owned businesses in China, officials said. Despite the large settlement, Bart Naylor of policy watchdog group Public Citizen, complained that the bank "has escaped true accountability" "JPMorgan executives belong in jail, but instead shareholders will foot the bill for what one government official described as 'systemic bribery,'" he said in a statement. - 'Sons and Daughters Program' - Officials at a regional subsidiary in Hong Kong created a client job referral program sometimes known internally as the "Sons and Daughters Program" to hire candidates of strategic value to the bank, according to the Justice Department. By 2009, senior executives had refined the program to seek candidates with "directly attributable linkage to business opportunity," federal prosecutors said, citing internal JP Morgan Chase records. In one example, JP Morgan won a leading role in the initial public offering for an unnamed state-owned Chinese company after hiring a candidate who bank executives knew was unqualified, for a job in New York. The candidate had been referred in 2009 by a senior Chinese official who promised the business in return for the hire. Candidates hired in this program typically received salaries equivalent to entry-level investment bankers despite performing mainly minor tasks such as proof-reeding, according to the Justice Department. - No criminal charges - Authorities brought no criminal charges against the bank as part of the settlement and took no enforcement action against individuals. However, a JP Morgan Chase subsidiary in Hong Kong fired six employees and disciplined 23 others for their roles in the misconduct, the Justice Department said. In the settlement, JP Morgan Chase agreed to pay $134 million in fines to the Justice Department and Federal Reserve, as well as another $130 million in to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Since 1977, the United States has criminalized the practice bribing foreign officials to win business under a Watergate-era statute known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Other countries have adopted similar laws but none enforces it as aggressively as the United States. US enforcement of the law has broadened in recent years, with authorities in Washington extending their reach to more industries and scrutinizing a greater range of business practices for corruption.

Photo: Reuters JPMorgan Chase & Co will pay more than US$250 million to settle allegations by the US government that it had hired children of Chinese decisionmakers to win business, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. The bank will pay roughly US$200 million combined to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the US Department of Justice, and more than US$50 million to the US Federal Reserve, the source said. There will not be any individual prosecution at this time, the source said. The SEC opened an investigation into JPMorgan in 2013 over the hiring. The justice department opened a parallel investigation around the same time. Investment banks have a long history of employing the children of China’s politically connected. While close ties to top government officials are a boon to any banking franchise across the world, they are especially beneficial in China, where relationships and personal connections play a critical role in business decisions. The SEC, JPMorgan and the justice department declined to comment. The settlement was first reported by Bloomberg. It will end a probe into whether the bank’s hires violated US anti-bribery laws, Bloomberg said. Meanwhile, conflicting information on whether JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon could become US secretary of the treasury as part of US president-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet cast a cloud of uncertainty over the nation’s largest bank. Tweets from Fox Business News reporters on Wednesday were the latest indication that Dimon was still in the running for the job, but initial word from anchor Maria Bartiromo that he would “get” the job was quickly knocked down. JPMorgan spokespeople have declined to make any official comment about the idea of Dimon joining the Trump administration since Thursday last week. Dimon declined to comment through a representative. A Trump transition team source told Reuters that Dimon is “pitching hard” for the Treasury role. However, two other sources indicated that he is not interested. One said Dimon has told colleagues since Tuesday last week, when Trump won the election, that he would not take the role. The three sources spoke on the condition of anonymity. Bartiromo cited a meeting scheduled for yesterday, where a decision was to be made on either Dimon or Steve Mnuchin, who was Trump’s campaign finance manager, as Treasury secretary. Her colleague Charles Gasparino said Dimon would only be willing to play an advisory role. Fortune later reported that Dimon has already said no. This story has been viewed 1055 times.

X JPMorgan to pay $200m fine for hiring Chinese ‘princelings’ Settlement is the first to emerge from SEC inquiry into bribes paid to overseas officials Thu, Nov 17, 2016, 12:55 JPMorgan: The SEC’s investigation has widened to include other banks. Photograph: iStock         JPMorgan has agreed to pay a fine of more than $200 million (€186 million) to settle a US investigation into its employment of well-connected Chinese “princelings” to win business, sources say. The settlement, expected to be announced on Thursday, would be the first to arise from a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry launched in 2013 to determine whether bank hiring practices breached the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The 1977 law bans companies from paying bribes to overseas officials to win business. The investigation sent shivers around the global banking community because hiring well-connected people for financial jobs is common in China where there is a strong emphasis on guanxi, or personal connections, in doing business. Princelings are technically the children of high-ranking Communist party officials, but the term is often generally applied to the sons and daughters of China’s elite. JPMorgan had made several high-profile hires, including Gao Jue, son of a Chinese commerce minister, later employed by Goldman Sachs, and Tang Xiaoning, son of a former bank regulator, who went on to chair Everbright Group. Other banks The investigation into JPMorgan soon widened to include other banks. Earlier this year, HSBC said it was one of several under investigation. Others to have been contacted by the regulator include Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley. The US inquiry has coincided with a Chinese crackdown on corruption, adding to the pressure on western investment banks struggling in Asia with slowing economies and lower fees than they earn elsewhere. Since 2013, many banks have shifted away from promoting well-connected “rainmakers” to lead their mainland businesses in favour of lower-profile leaders. They have also de-emphasised forging strong connections with senior officials. Churn among JPMorgan’s top ranks in the wake of the SEC probe saw Fang Fang step down as China investment banking head in 2014 and Todd Marin as vice-chairman of the its Asia investment bank last year. ADVERTISEMENT As a result of the US investigation, the bank stepped away from various deals, including the public floats of Tianhe Chemical and Everbright Bank, because it was connected with the children of the chairmen of both groups. Joyce Wei, daughter of Tianhe chairman Wei Qi, worked at JPMorgan from January 2012-August 2013, according to the Hong Kong regulator’s register of authorised finance professionals. – (Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2016)       Topics: Fang Fang Gao Jue Tang Xiaoning Todd Marin Wei Joyce Wei Qi Exchange Commission SEC Securities and Exchange Commission Citigroup Deutsche Bank Everbright Bank Everbright Group Goldman Sachs Group HSBC JPMorgan Morgan Stanley Tianhe Chemical China Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Markets Goodbody warns of Trump’s ‘beggar thy neighbour’ plans Economy John FitzGerald: Long way to go in fight against climate change Irish News Gay Byrne to miss radio show over cancer concerns Gaelic Games Clare’s Ballyea clinch maiden Munster hurling title Sponsored Maia Dunphy: Let’s talk about fertility Designing the F-Pace: the story of Jaguar's best-seller HR managers need a simplified approach to pensions World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Hammond says UK budget is constrained by high debt 17:31 Seen and Heard: Facebook secures payments services licence 16:59 Goodbody warns of Trump’s ‘beggar thy neighbour’ plans 16:48 Kingspan spends €35m on US acquisition 14:58 How to . . . help out your smartphone battery 14:00 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in Business 1 How to . . . help out your smartphone battery 2 Central Bank set to ease mortgage lending rules 3 Ireland’s biggest landlord: ‘I feel bad for the Irish people’ 4 Goodbody warns of Trump’s ‘beggar thy neighbour’ plans 5 Kingspan spends €35m on US acquisition 6 May’s changing vocabulary signals shift from ‘hard Brexit’ 7 Ireland could be facing even bigger recession, Martin warns 8 Workers take fight against ‘gig economy’ disrupters to court 9 Ires Reit: the facts behind Ireland’s biggest landlord 10 Donald Trump’s team reveals surprising lack of global business knowledge Never miss a story.

Jamie Dimon would be "very good" for the U.S. as Treasury Secretary, but potentially losing him would be a blow to JPMorgan JPMtrue, Colm Kelleher, president of rival bank Morgan Stanley MStrue, told CNBC. Kelleher also said that it was "encouraging that the Trump transition team had made "practical" appointments, calling Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus a "wise choice" as chief of staff. On the other candidates reported to be in the running the role of treasury secretary in President-elect Donald Trump 's administration, Kelleher said that he did not know former Goldman Sachs GStrue banker Steven Mnuchin but added that Mnuchin was "qualified" and that "people (spoke) highly of him." There were conflicting news reports on Wednesday over whether Dimon, a Wall Street veteran who led JPMorgan through the global financial crisis, was a candidate for treasury secretary. Fox anchor Maria Bartiromo tweeted that Dimon would "get" the job and Fox Business News reporters tweeted that Dimon was one of the candidates being considered. Meanwhile, a Trump transition team source told Reuters that Dimon was "pitching hard" for the job. But two other sources told the newswire that Dimon was not interested, and Reuters reported that JPMorgan spokespeople as well as Dimon had declined to comment. "Jamie Dimon, I think, has been an exceptional leader in finance, pre- and post-crisis," Kelleher told CNBC's " Squawkbox " at the Morgan Stanley Asia Pacific Summit in Singapore on Thursday. "It would be very good for the country were it Jamie Dimon, it probably wouldn't be so good for Chase." JPMorgan shares were up 0.57 percent in aftermarket trade but fell 2.47 percent on Wednesday, following reports that Dimon could join the Trump administration. Kelleher attributed Trump's surprise election win to the same voter sentiment that drove Britain 's unexpected vote to exit the European Union. "I think the Trump presidency is just another example of populist outrage at the establishment," he said, adding that the same political phenomenon was being seen elsewhere, citing upcoming elections in Germany , France and Austria . Far right parties espousing anti-immigration rhetoric have been making headway across Europe in recent months. This was most notable when the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party defeated German Chancellor Angela Merkel 's Christian Democrats in regional elections in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in September. In France, the right-wing politician Marine Le Pen is expected to be one of the final two candidates in the first round of the country's presidential elections . "People are voting on sentiment rather than the issues themselves at the moment," Kelleher added. Meanwhile, Kelleher was confident that markets had largely got the "reflationary" post-Trump trade right, despite scant details on the President-elect's policy proposals. "I think (infrastructure spend) will be significant ... (With) the House and the Senate both Republican, probably he will get a lift in the debt ceiling to allow him to do that," Kelleher said, adding that Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton had proposed a similar infrastructure policy to Trump's, and that there was a broad consensus of approval for such a move.

Do this first, Donald Posted on November 17, 2016November 11, 2016 by GS Early Views: 2,897 188 Shares Now that we have a new president elected and preparing to take on the role as the world’s most powerful CEO, there is plenty of talk about what President Trump should do first. Many say the first is to bury Obamacare. Others suggest getting a conservative Supreme Court justice. Still, others want us to put ISIS down once and for all, along with the Assad regime in Syria. My number one wish is a little simpler. I want Trump to cut off the bailout funds that are going to the big banks, a full eight years after those same criminal bankers almost tanked the global economy. That’s right, they’re still getting paid from taxpayer dollars — JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank of America. Yep, most of the rogue’s gallery of financial thieves. According to The Washington Post, Wells Fargo — you know, the bank that just axed 5,000 lower level workers for a scheme started by greedy execs who walked away without a scratch — is eligible for another $1.5 billion over the next seven years. JPMorgan could receive $1.1 billion; Bank of America $964 million. These payments are the last vestiges of the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program cobbled together by the banksters and their politicians. Of that enormous figure, a mere $28 billion went to help struggling homeowners. So, after handing over $672 billion to the banks, the Fed then began its infamous “quantitative easing” (a.k.a. QE) programs. Up to now, the Fed bought $4.8 trillion of Treasuries and then lent money to the banksters at zero to near-zero interest in the hopes they would loan the money. But the banks decided it was easier to simply buy Treasuries for 3 to 4 percent and triple their money risk free, rather than lend it out to individuals and businesses to get the economy going again. And for all that self-serving greed, they continue to get rewarded. Unbelievable. So, my hope is President Trump cuts off this fail upward cycle that we have seen since the financial crisis. Now, as far as the stocks that look good here, there are a handful of sectors that will be direct beneficiaries: Defense. As I’ve discussed before, it isn’t just a Trump administration that would promote bolstering defense, there is a major supercycle underway to rebuild the military after Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. Healthcare stocks (health insurers, biotechs, pharmaceuticals) will be winners because Obamacare will be completely reformed and the drug makers will not be under the scrutiny that was threatened by a Clinton presidency. Financials (national bankster more than regional or local banks) will be strong less because of Trump but because they are major Treasury bond holders and the Fed will raise rates in December. Rising rates makes for bigger returns. Insurance companies will also be winners of this trend. Energy will also be a winner… but it will take some time. There is still a massive oil glut, so prices will not be high enough for any U.S. firms to make much money. Although if prices go too high, consumers and fuel-intensive businesses will be hurt. The sweet spot will be $50 to 75 a barrel. Coal will still struggle because the switch to natural gas has already taken place with most industries and utilities. Utilities will likely have less regulatory issues. Apparently, Trump is looking to completely revamp the EPA. Infrastructure (heavy industry and manufacturing). With a lighter touch from the EPA the companies that still make things in the U.S. will have an easier time meeting environmental regulations. Plus, Democrats will support infrastructure spending, so it won’t be a battle. This is a pretty optimistic list, but given the market’s initial reaction to the Trump win, it’s not unrealistic.

SUJATA RAO and NICHOLA SAMINATHER LONDON and SINGAPORE — Reuters Published Friday, Nov. 18, 2016 5:03PM EST Last updated Friday, Nov. 18, 2016 5:07PM EST Comments AA The year threatens to end as it began for emerging markets – with losses. After spectacular returns between end-January and October, emerging market stocks and bonds are again in retreat, disappointing investors who had hoped the sector had finally turned a corner after lagging its developed market peers for years. Money managers who attended last year’s Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit had correctly called a turn in favour of emerging markets. At this year’s summit (Nov. 14-19) – just after Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential election victory – the mood was far less buoyant. In the wake of the election, investors pulled a record $6.4-billion (U.S.) from emerging bond funds tracked by JPMorgan – a full 10 per cent of what had been received year to date. Equity funds shed a third of year-to-date inflows, data showed. Returns for 2016 are still positive. But foreseeing more pain, many summit participants said they had cashed out their emerging market trades. Among them is NN Investment Partners, which turned positive on emerging markets toward the end of 2015 but recently reversed gear. “For us, Trump has been a game-changer for emerging markets,” Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, NNIP’s chief strategist, told the London leg of the summit. He said Mr. Trump might or might not carry through on pledges to slap tariffs on trade partners or build a wall to keep out Mexican immigrants. But he is seen unleashing a trillion dollars of stimulus through tax cuts and infrastructure spending. That is feeding through to U.S. bond markets, where rising yields are pricing in a jump in inflation. “It’s not just the risk of protectionism that we are worried about in emerging markets, it is the combination of that risk along with reflation which is undermining the story,” Mr. van Nieuwenhuijzen added. Those “reflation” bets have already taken some steam out of emerging markets since mid-October. A Merrill Lynch investor survey just after the Nov. 8 election found emerging equity allocations suffering their biggest month-on-month drop in five-and-a-half years. Bhaskar Laxminarayan, Asia CIO for Julius Baer, said 90 per cent of his firm’s global equity portfolio was in developed markets, as headwinds from Western protectionism grow. “We’ve achieved peak globalization … If you have a couple of years of this to play out, that’s not the best time to be in emerging markets,” Mr. Laxminarayan told the summit in Singapore. ‘Ground zero’ The emerging rally earlier this year had coincided with a 5-per-cent fall in the U.S. dollar index. Since the election, the greenback’s value has risen 5 per cent to 14-year highs. “Investors had been assuming the dollar had peaked. If that assumption turns out to be wrong … that does change the landscape quite dramatically,” said Richard Titherington, emerging markets head at JPMorgan Asset Management. But Mr. Trump’s election may not be unequivocally negative for the developing world if his infrastructure plans reignite commodity demand and boost U.S. growth. “It’s not time to get out yet. Commodities are stabilizing, the fact we’re now seeing earnings growth in emerging market companies, these make us think that, on the equities side, emerging markets can continue to move forward,” said Mark Haefele, CIO of the $2-trillion UBS Wealth Management. Emerging market debt is another story. Higher U.S. yields don’t just reduce the appeal of emerging bonds, they also make it costlier for governments and companies to roll over maturing debt or raise fresh finance. Mr. Haefele is steering clear, calling emerging market bonds “Ground zero” in the event of additional unexpected U.S. rate rises. Bonds in currencies such as the rand and the ruble could be at the sharp end of a sell-off. These rebounded this year after three years of losses, with big-name investors such as BlackRock and Pimco buying back in. Speaking in New York, BlackRock’s fixed income CIO Rick Rieder said he wasn’t ready to back off yet, calling emerging markets “a great opportunity” for 2017. Many summit participants said they might return in 2017, arguing there was potential in parts of the developing world and that rampant dollar gains were likely to prove unpalatable to U.S. policy-makers. Mexico has borne the brunt of Trump-related selling, but Didier Saint-Georges of Carmignac Gestion was among many who said the peso’s huge depreciation would boost competitiveness. “I would buy [Mexican assets] now, absolutely, with a 2017 perspective,” Mr. Saint-Georges said. GAM Investment Solutions also has hung on to the peso, while trimming other emerging market holdings. Its group head Larry Hatheway however plans to re-enter once bonds and the dollar settle. “When we look to 2017 and look at parts of markets that should perform, my sense is emerging equities, currencies will be good to be in,” Mr. Hatheway said. “It’s just a not-for-now story.” Report Typo/Error Also on The Globe and Mail Emerging market risk runs high on U.S. election (Reuters)   JPM-NJPMorgan Chase & Co Latest Price$77.71 -0.31 (-0.40%) BLK-NBlackRock Inc Latest Price$372.78 +1.41 (+0.38%) Updated November 18 4:00 PM EST. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

Watch all of this here, please: http://www.unicornriot.ninja/?p=11110 BREAKING NEWS, This report from Unicorn Riot: "As soon as the march of water protectors approached Wells Fargo from the sidewalk, police quickly grabbed and arrested one man who was heading up the front of the march. - Advertisement - A few minutes after the first arrest, deputies from the Cass County Sheriff's Department grabbed another man down the street and immediately began dragging him across the ground, slamming him to the pavement, and striking him with their fists and feet. Witnesses told Unicorn Riot that the man was placed under arrest after attempting to hand Sheriff's deputies a flower that he had picked. Cass County Sheriff's deputies continued to brutalize the man, punching, kicking and kneeing him, after moving him near a squad car across the street. The man was heard screaming that his shoulder had been dislocated, and also yelled that he was a military veteran who was having a panic attack. Cass County Sheriff's deputies who were restraining and beating the man were repeatedly heard saying "stop resisting" and "stop reaching for my gun." Sheriff's deputies and police officers worked to obstruct the view of the beating by creating a visual barrier with their bodies, as well as threatening all eyewitnesses present at the scene with arrest. A bleeding wound on his head was visible as well as blood splattered on the ground. At some point during the incident, a transparent hood was placed over the man's head. - Advertisement - Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney was present for this entire incident. When asked if the hood placed on the man's head was a form of "hooding", considered to be a form of torture under international law, Sheriff Laney stated that the bag on the man's head was a "valid spit hood." >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> A press release from Greenpeace Thursday says the largest bank in Norway, DNB, sold its assets in the Dakota Access pipeline.

Submitted on Friday, Nov 18, 2016 at 11:02:01 AM     (1+)   pablo mayhew (Member since Aug 14, 2014), 7 fans, 4 articles, 587 comments    Good stuff, Stephen. Thank you. The Norwegian bank pullout is indeed encouraging news. For some reason, I was unable to access video footage via the article link. I did, however, manage to find a video of the event on YouTube. Appalling. The first question, naturally, is why it takes seven or nine cops to subdue one clearly subdued and wounded unarmed man. Something needs to be said about that scene, but it must be done carefully. Without seeking to place Stephen Fox, OEN, myself, or anyone or anything else that those in power might seek to drag into the realm of complicity in some way, I guess I will say it like this: If this kind of brutal neo-fascist reaction by the the law-enforcement arm of the One Percent to people expressing their views and standing up for their rights persists--which it undoubtedly will--the time will soon arrive when being a spectator to such a warped and grotesque show of force will no longer suffice. I suppose it comes down to one's definition of acceptable risk. Myself, I have been sickened and repulsed by what I have seen of the police brutality that has surrounded the Dakota Pipeline situation from the outset. And I have no illusions whatsoever of how little I have seen of what has occurred. Chances are fair--as we continue to push back against the oligarchic octopus that has its tentacles into virtually all aspects of American life--that any of us may encounter similarly grim and morally unacceptable situations in our own environment. It is an unfortunate reality of our age. We all will have a choice to make at that point. But quite possibly the situation will make the choice for us. It may be wise to prepare for such an occurrence--like it or not.

As articulate as you are, you could make a fine presentation to the Boards of Directors of JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, as to why THEY should also pull out. Today, I was in Wells Fargo, which I am unable to leave for many reasons, and about five people urged the head tellers and personal bankers to get in touch with them through some kind of fill out this form deal, but I will do some more research and track these names down for an OEN articles.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases pr @ satprnews.com Fitch Upgrades 2 Classes of JPMCCM 2005-LDP1 NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Fitch Ratings has upgraded two classes, downgraded one and affirmed six defaulted classes of JP Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. series 2005-LDP1 (JPMCCM 2005-LDP1) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrades to the two senior classes reflect increasing credit enhancement and expectation of continued pay down relative to Fitch’s expected losses. Fitch modeled losses of 10.5% of the remaining pool; expected losses on the original pool balance total 4.1%, including $114.6 million (4% of the original pool balance) in realized losses to date. One loan is defeased (1.7% of the pool) As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool’s aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 98% to $45 million from $2.88 billion at issuance. Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes K through NR. Concentrated Pool: Although the transaction has experienced significant pay down, the pool is extremely concentrated with only 11 loans and one REO asset remaining. Retail properties comprise the majority of the remaining pool at 71%. The two largest loans, which have related sponsorship and account for 49% of the total pool balance, are grocery anchored community shopping centers located in Niles, IL and Virginia Beach, VA. The REO (14% of the pool), and the transaction’s only specially serviced asset, is a 162,000 sf office property located in Greenwood, IN. The special servicer is focused on stabilizing the 79% occupied property prior to marketing it for sale. Maturities: No loan matures prior to 2019. The two largest loans in the pool (49%) are scheduled to mature in December 2019. Amortization: All performing loans are amortizing with six loans (25% of the pool) fully amortizing over their terms. The Fitch stressed LTV for the pool is 87.3%. RATING SENSITIVITIES The Stable Outlooks on classes F and G reflect the class’s sufficient credit enhancement and expectation of continued pay down. Class F is expected to be paid in full over the next year from scheduled amortization. Further upgrades to class G may be limited due to the increasing concentration of the pool. Fitch ran an additional sensitivity analysis on the pool which applied a 50% loss to the two largest loans, both of which mature in 2019. Credit enhancement to classes F and G remained sufficient to support the ratings. USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10 No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action. Fitch has upgraded the following ratings: –$1.3 million class F to ‘AAAsf’ from ‘BBBsf’; Outlook Stable; –$28.8 million class G to ‘BBsf’ from ‘CCCsf’; Outlook Stable. Fitch has downgraded the following rating: –$14.9 million class H to ‘Dsf’ from ‘Csf’; RE 80%. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: –$0 class J at ‘Dsf’; RE 0%; –$0 class K at ‘Dsf’; RE 0%; –$0 class L at ‘Dsf’; RE 0%; –$0 class M at ‘Dsf’; RE 0%; –$0 class N at ‘Dsf’; RE 0%; –$0 class P at ‘Dsf’; RE 0%. Classes A-1 through E have paid in full. Fitch does not rate the class NR certificates. Fitch previously withdrew the ratings on the interest-only class X-1 and X-2 certificates.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts.

The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.

After spectacular returns between end-January and October, emerging market stocks and bonds are again in retreat, disappointing investors who had hoped the sector had finally turned a corner after lagging its developed market peers for years. Money managers who attended last year's Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit had correctly called a turn in favour of emerging markets. At this year's summit, held Nov. 14-19 - just after Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election victory - the mood was far less buoyant. In the wake of the election, investors pulled a record $6.4 billion from emerging bond funds tracked by JPMorgan - a full 10 percent of what had been received year-to-date. Equity funds shed a third of year-to-date inflows, data showed. Returns for 2016 are still positive. But foreseeing more pain, many summit participants said they had cashed out their emerging market trades. Among them is NN Investment Partners, which turned positive on emerging markets towards the end of 2015 but recently reversed gear. "For us, Trump has been a game-changer for emerging markets," Valentijn van Nieuwenhuijzen, NNIP's chief strategist, told the London leg of the summit. He said Trump might or might not carry through on pledges to slap tariffs on trade partners or build a wall to keep out Mexican immigrants. But he is seen unleashing a trillion dollars of stimulus through tax cuts and infrastructure spending. That is feeding through to U.S. bond markets, where rising yields are pricing in a jump in inflation. "It's not just the risk of protectionism that we are worried about in emerging markets, it is the combination of that risk along with reflation which is undermining the story," van Nieuwenhuijzen added. Those "reflation" bets have already taken some steam out of emerging markets since mid-October. A Bank of America Merrill Lynch investor survey just after the Nov. 8 election found emerging equity allocations suffering their biggest month-on-month drop in 5 1/2 years. Bhaskar Laxminarayan, Asia CIO for Julius Baer, said 90 percent of his firm's global equity portfolio was in developed markets, as headwinds from Western protectionism grow. "We've achieved peak globalization ... If you have a couple of years of this to play out, that's not the best time to be in emerging markets," Laxminarayan told the summit in Singapore. "GROUND ZERO" The emerging rally earlier this year had coincided with a 5 percent fall in the dollar index. Since the election, the greenback's value has risen 5 percent to 14-year highs. "Investors had been assuming the dollar had peaked. If that assumption turns out to be wrong ... that does change the landscape quite dramatically," said Richard Titherington, emerging markets head at JPMorgan Asset Management. But Trump's election may not be unequivocally negative for the developing world if his infrastructure plans re-ignite commodity demand and boost U.S. growth. "It's not time to get out yet. Commodities are stabilising, the fact we're now seeing earnings growth in emerging market companies, these make us think that, on the equities side, emerging markets can continue to move forward," said Mark Haefele, CIO of the $2 trillion UBS Wealth Management. Emerging market debt is another story. Higher U.S. yields don't just reduce the appeal of emerging bonds, they also make it costlier for governments and companies to roll over maturing debt or raise fresh finance. Haefele is steering clear, calling emerging market bonds "Ground Zero" in the event of additional unexpected U.S. rate rises. Bonds in currencies such as the rand and the rouble could be at the sharp end of a selloff. These rebounded this year after three years of losses, with big-name investors such as BlackRock and PIMCO buying back in. Speaking in New York, BlackRock's fixed income CIO Rick Rieder said he wasn't ready to back off yet, calling emerging markets "a great opportunity" for 2017. "NOT-FOR-NOW STORY" Many summit participants said they might return in 2017, arguing there was potential in parts of the developing world and that rampant dollar gains were likely to prove unpalatable to U.S. policymakers. Mexico has borne the brunt of Trump-related selling, but Didier Saint-Georges of Carmignac Gestion was among many who said the peso's huge depreciation would boost competitiveness. "I would buy (Mexican assets) now, absolutely, with a 2017 perspective," Saint-Georges said. GAM Investment Solutions also has hung on to the peso, while trimming other emerging market holdings. Its group head Larry Hatheway however plans to re-enter once bonds and the dollar settle. "When we look to 2017 and look at parts of markets that should perform, my sense is emerging equities, currencies will be good to be in," Hatheway said. "It's just a not-for-now story."

Trump.” With that caveat, this person also said rumors that Steve Mnuchin was out for Treasury were wrong. And they expressed skepticism that Jamie Dimon would get an offer given negative things the JPMorganChase CEO has said about Trump. Also unlikely: House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling. Too many lobbyist connections, evidently. Still, the bottom line is nobody knows, probably not even Trump, and any of these people could get Treasury. Pretty much everyone has been floated as a potential Secretary of State, including frequent Trump critic Mitt Romney. To MM, tapping Romney would be a genius move to show both magnanimity and a desire to calm fears in the establishment of Trump’s approach to Russia (among other things). But is Trump capable of such a gesture? Story Continued Below A DIFFERENT VIEW ON WALL STREET AND TRUMP — Better Markets' Dennis Kelleher with a slightly different view from our Thursday piece: “[I]it seems unlikely that President Trump is going to deliver Wall Street's biggest banks their most desired special interests, which they have been lobbying unsuccessfully to get for years. … “The salivating Wall Street bankers and their lawyers and lobbyists may turn out to be right, but a President Trump should be a leader in aggressively regulating Wall Street's too big to fail banks, nonbanks and activities so that they can't do again to the American people what they did in 2008” MM VS KUDLOW — The venerable Larry Kudlow, one of the smartest and nicest people we know, also has a different view. He believes Steve Bannon will guide Trump away from pro-Wall Street policies and that Hensarling will offer relief to smaller banks but not big ones. He also suggested Trump might follow through on a new Glass-Steagall. If all this comes to pass, MM owes Larry dinner. We debated it on CNBC’s Closing Bell. Watch here. TROUBLED WATERS — POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt: “Rep. Maxine Waters, who has clashed on policy with … Hensarling for years, would be ‘very worried’ about the Texas Republican becoming the next Treasury secretary. In an interview Thursday, Waters said the House Financial Services Committee chairman was on the opposite side of Democrats ‘on all the big issues.’ Waters has served as the top Democrat on the committee since Hensarling took control of its gavel in 2013. “She said they have a ‘friendly relationship,’ but she would rather not see him become the 77th Treasury secretary. ‘No, I would not be happy with that at all,’ the California Democrat said. A longstanding divide between Hensarling and Waters is their approach to policing the financial system. As Treasury secretary, Hensarling would chair FSOC … Hensarling said he would prefer that FSOC play ‘no role’ in imposing its will on capital markets. … “[HFSC] spokesman Jeff Emerson: “After last week's elections, the ranking member probably needs to spend more time worrying about how divided her party is and why the American people just repudiated her party's liberal agenda. People all across the country voted for the Republican majority because we offer a better way.” Read more. TRANSITION CAN OFFICIALLY BEGIN — POLITICO’s Nancy Cook: “The Trump transition team filed the last pieces of necessary paperwork late Thursday afternoon that enables it to start receiving briefings and go into federal agencies. This document, called the Memorandum of Understanding … basically kicks off the transfer of power from one administration to the next and lets the future Trump administration begin to think through its plan for the federal government.” Read more. GOLDMAN ON TRUMP AND CONGRESS — Goldman Sachs analyst Alec Philips in a podcast with Goldman’s Jake Siewert: “Because of the procedural rules of the Senate you need 60 votes to break a filibuster and they’ve got … 52 seats, they’re going to need eight Democrats. “There are some exceptions to that. And so, the exceptions would be on sort of fiscal related legislation, where they can use something called the reconciliation process to pass bills that deal with tax policy, certain areas of spending, as long as they’re involved in sort of the broader budget process with a simple majority.” Listen. MORE ON KASHKARI — From Tyler Gellasch, a former legislative aide who helped write the Volcker rule: “I wouldn't be surprised if Kashkari's dramatic capital raise, which would be in-line with what many bank reformers would hope, snags a lot of support from both sides of the aisle … and a lot of opposition. “A much higher capital requirement for big banks may be the price for shedding the Volcker Rule and other systemic risk constraints. Depending on the details, even I might take that trade.” HOT CLICK — American Action Forum has a list of at least 48 regulations Trump could wipe away in January. DOLLAR KEEPS RISING — Reuters: “The dollar vaulted to 13 1/2-year highs against a basket of major currencies as U.S. bond yields rose, leaving Asian stocks vulnerable to potential rotation out of emerging markets to the United States. … The dollar's rise, however, was a boon for Japan's exporter-driven Nikkei average, which rose 0.9 percent to a 10-month high.” Read more. RATE HIKE ON TRACK — Bloomberg: “[Fed Chair Janet Yellen] suggested the Federal Open Market Committee wouldn’t be knocked off course from raising interest rates next month after Trump won victory last week on a campaign that the economy was in terrible shape. The labor market is continuing to improve and inflation is starting to rise toward the Fed’s 2 percent goal amid signs of increasing wage gains, she said.” Read more.

TRUMP AND THE WORLD — IHS on the impact of Trump on the global economy: “The election of Donald Trump ... has the potential of upsetting the established global order and changing the economic outlook. If protectionist policies are pursued, growth in global trade and real GDP will likely be slower and inflation will probably be higher — a recipe for stagflation. “If more pragmatic and pro-growth policies are pursued, then economic growth, inflation, and interest rates will all be higher — an outcome that will benefit most but not all economies. IHS Global Insight believes the latter scenario is more likely than the former. … Brexit and political uncertainty in Europe had already clouded Europe’s outlook. The US election could embolden right-wing populist parties in Europe and make the Brexit negotiations more complicated” ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: Now delivering: Retirement security for life! We know saving for retirement can be difficult, but policymakers can help by supporting policies to encourage saving, make retirement plans more widely available, and facilitate access to lifetime income strategies. Let’s send Americans paychecks for life. Learn more at: http://irionline.org/agenda. ** MNUCHIN BANK HIT WITH REDLINING ALLEGATIONS — POLITICO’s Lorraine Woellert: “OneWest Bank, a mortgage lender founded and run by Steven Mnuchin until last year, discriminated against blacks, Hispanics and Asians and avoided putting branches in minority communities, according to a federal complaint filed by two California housing watchdogs. “The redlining accusation, filed with [HUD], was made against CIT Group Inc., which purchased OneWest in a $3.4 billion deal that closed last year. Mnuchin … is on CIT's board. While the complaint doesn't name Mnuchin specifically, it could complicate any decision to nominate him for a Cabinet post” Read more. WHALEN ON KASHKARI — BRA's Chris Whalen on Kashkari’s proposal: “Kashkari suggests excessive levels of capital to address the problem of big banks, an extension of the false narrative that a lack of capital caused the 2008 financial crisis. This view is wrong for several reasons. First and foremost, the top banks are big because the Fed … and other regulators have over the past several decades encouraged a series of mergers between large strong banks and the weak. … “Second, prudential regulations give the largest banks with active securities businesses an unfair advantage vs smaller institutions. These regulations allow the largest banks to swell to enormous size, both in terms of their visible balance sheets and the less-apparent off balance sheet (OBS) obligations” MORE KASHKARI REACT — From Tom Quaadman, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber’s Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness: “The plan wasn’t really surprising: more capital, more scrutiny, and new taxes .. What was surprising, though, was President Kashkari’s lack of understanding of how important a strong financial system is to economic growth and Main Street business” Read more. LOBBYISTS SCOFF AT TRUMP RULE — POLITICO’s Isaac Arnsdorf: “K Street quickly cast doubt on the effectiveness of Donald Trump's five-year lobbying ban on transition and administration officials, saying the rule would both deter top talent from joining Trump's team and widen the use of loopholes. On its face, Trump's ban would last longer than any policy in force before. But it's already become increasingly common for former officials to find ways to use their influence without registering as lobbyists. “Trump's ban will probably intensify that trend, and its announcement probably had more to do with protecting the president-elect's anti-establishment image than actually disrupting the revolving door, lobbyists and legal experts said” Read more. CFPB FOCUSED ON FINANCIAL DATA — POLITICO’s Colin Wilhelm: “The CFPB on Thursday stepped further into the growing debate over the future of finance: who controls the consumer data that's vital to both startups and traditional financial companies. In a request for information, as well as at a public field hearing, the CFPB doubled down on statements about the importance of consumer access and control of their financial data, an issue on which Director Richard Cordray first planted a flag at an industry conference last month” Read more. TRUMP TAPS FLYNN - POLITICO's Bryan Bender: "President-elect Donald Trump has tapped retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, one of his top confidants, to be White House national security adviser, which would elevate the controversial surrogate to be the chief arbiter of virtually every major defense and foreign policy decision. "Flynn’s appointment was confirmed to POLITICO by a source close to the Trump transition on Thursday night, though it was not clear whether Flynn has responded." Read more. ABE LAUDS TRUMP — Bloomberg’s Akiko Nishimae and Isabel Reynold: “Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Donald Trump was a trustworthy leader in comments after his first meeting with the U.S. President-elect, whose statements on trade and security have sparked concern in Japan. “Abe told reporters in New York on Thursday night that he had frank discussions in a ‘warm atmosphere’ at Trump Tower. He said he explained his views on a range of issues, but declined to comment on the substance of the talks in a meeting that lasted more than an hour. Abe gave Trump a golf club, and received a golf shirt from the real-estate mogul.” Read more. ROMNEY HEADS TO THE TOWER — CNBC’s Antonio Jose Vielma: “Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney will meet with Donald Trump this weekend to discuss the secretary of state position, a source close to the president-elect with direct knowledge of his thinking told NBC News. “Separately, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich told NBC News on Thursday he will not be in Trump's cabinet, instead choosing to focus on ‘strategic planning for the emerging Republican majority.’” Read more. FED FIGHTS FOR INDEPENDENCE — FT’s Barney Jopson: “Janet Yellen has stressed the importance of central bank independence in her first public remarks after Donald Trump’s election victory as new data showed the president-elect will inherit a strengthening economy. “Ms Yellen said it was ‘critically important’ that central banks had the freedom to make judgments about how best to pursue their goals. Her remarks followed attacks during the election campaign by Mr Trump, who claimed the Fed had kept interest rates low to help the Obama administration.” Read more. DRAIN THE … SCHUMER? — Business Insiders’ Allan Smith: “It just so happens that the Democrat who will likely have to work closest with Trump is also the senator who's received more in campaign donations from the Manhattan billionaire than any other member of the Senate. “From 1996, when Schumer was running for a House seat, to 2010, Trump donated roughly $9,000 directly to the New York Democrat's campaign, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Three of Trump's children — Eric, Donald Jr., and Ivanka — donated a combined $6,800 to Schumer. Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband and a top adviser to the president-elect, donated $4,000 to Schumer.” Read more. MUSK MERGER — WSJ’s Tim Higgins and Cassandra Sweet: “Shareholders of Tesla Motors Inc. and SolarCity Corp. approved Tesla’s $2.1 billion all-stock offer to merge and create one company headed by Elon Musk that would sell emissions-free cars and rooftop solar panels that power them. “Tesla announced that the merger was approved by 85 percent of Tesla shareholders, excluding Mr. Musk and other affiliated shareholders. SolarCity didn’t disclose the percentage of its shareholders voting.” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: As traditional pensions have disappeared, American workers have become more responsible for saving and preparing for their retirements. With longer lifespans, this often means saving for a longer retirement. These challenges have made planning and saving for retirement more difficult. But what if all Americans could get paychecks for life? Policymakers can help make this possible by supporting policies that encourage saving, make workplace retirement plans more broadly available, and facilitate access to lifetime income strategies. Let’s send Americans retirement security.

JPMorgan Chase settles bribery case for $264 million JPMorgan Chase & Co. agreed to pay $264 million to settle accusations that the bank hired the children of Chinese leaders to win business in China, federal prosecutors and regulators said in a statement on Thursday. The New York Times reported the hiring practices of the bank and its Hong Kong subsidiary violated United States law governing foreign bribery. The bank had argued that hiring well-connected employees was routine practice in China. Regulators didn’t agree, and also are investigating the hiring practices of other large banks, the New York Times reported. Fed Chair Yellen says Fed could hike rates soon Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen said the recent presidential election has done nothing to alter the central bank’s plans to raise interest rates “relatively soon,” according to Reuters. Yellen said the Fed would change its outlook if the new Trump administration dramatically lowers taxes and government spending. She sounded a cautionary note on President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to “turn back the clock” on the Dodd-Frank financial regulations approved in the wake of the financial meltdown. Yellen told Congress economic data justified a rate hike “relatively soon.” Wal-Mart sales climb, though profit slumps U.S. retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. continues to trail Amazon.com in its quest to revamp its online operations. Wal-Mart lured more shoppers during the quarter, but profits fell as the retailer invested heavily to compete with Amazon, The Wall Street Journal reported. Same-store sales climbed 1.2 percent for the quarter, the ninth straight increase, according to The Wall Street Journal. Company executives also said the strong dollar trimmed the retailer’s overseas revenue. Marijuana industry readies for post-election gains The Economist reported the U.S. cannabis industry is celebrating following the November 8th election results. Four states, including California, voted to approve recreational marijuana use, while another four states approved medical marijuana. Industry leaders met this week in Las Vegas to discuss growth opportunities. Last year, legal sales of pot climbed to $6 billion, according to the Arcview Group, an investment and market-research firm. Despite the growth of legal recreational cannabis use, federal laws banning the drug prohibit large-scale investment from banks and private equity firms.         Related Posts Must-Read Money Stories for Tuesday, Nov. 15 Must-Read Money Stories for Wednesday, Nov. 16 Must-Read Money Stories for Thursday, Nov. 17 must read money stories Search Our Site Search for: Subscribe to Our Podcast     Latest News Must-Read Money Stories for Friday, Nov. 18 Share this!JPMorgan Chase settles bribery case for $264 million JPMorgan November 18, 2016 Staff Editor to Freelance Writer: 4 Tips for a Successful Career Transition Share this!Whether or not to go freelance might be one November 18, 2016 Donald W.

ALSO READ Brexit could add to European banking costs - JPMorgan's Dimon Clutch Auto to hold board meeting Clutch Auto to hold board meeting Nobel winner says CEO pay too complex, echoing investor gripe JPMorgan Chase CEO says bank it will raise minimum pay By David Henry NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co is once again facing questions about who will succeed its larger-than-life chief executive after Jamie Dimon was courted by the incoming U.S. president for the role of Treasury secretary. Dimon, 60, has been running the largest U.S. bank for more than a decade and has faced questions about his longevity in the role before: when potential successors left, when he allowed an embarrassing $6.2 billion derivatives trading loss and, most recently, when he was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2014. Although associates have said Dimon is not interested in the Treasury job, the recent invitation from a member of President-elect Donald Trump's transition team to apply for the job was a reminder to interested parties, including some investors, that his time at the helm is finite. "He is not going to be CEO forever," said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Management, which owns JPMorgan shares. Although a sudden departure would not necessarily lead the investor to sell the stock, it would be "troubling," Todd said. "I would have to gain some comfort with who was taking over that role." Dimon will not be easy to replace. He has won a higher valuation for JPMorgan stock than rival banks by shepherding it through the financial crisis without any quarterly losses, while earning relatively high returns on equity and explaining the workings of the bank to analysts as though he were a demanding business school professor. He has been quick to point out that the JPMorgan board has a succession plan in place, whether he departs abruptly due to unforeseen circumstances - known colloquially as a "hit by a truck" scenario - or whether he takes part in a more gradual transition. The board does not publicize those plans. Doing so could prompt executives who are not the favorite to leave. There are six key members of Dimon's management team who are often mentioned in discussions about succession. They range in age from 46 to 58, with the older executives seen as "hit by a truck" contenders, and younger ones thought to be potential CEOs-in-training. Each has some qualities Dimon has identified as necessary for the next CEO - like moving through senior roles in different parts of the company, having experience with the investment bank, or having the temperament to be the public face of JPMorgan - but none clearly has them all. JPMORGAN'S GOT TALENT Gordon Smith, a 58-year-old Briton with computer science training, is chief executive of the consumer bank. He runs nearly half of JPMorgan, including Chase branches, credit cards, mortgages and auto loans. Dimon hired him from American Express Co in 2007. Although Smith has many of the skills needed to be CEO, he is close enough to Dimon's age that insiders see him as an unlikely long-term candidate. Daniel Pinto, 53, who oversees corporate and investment banking, is also on the succession shortlist. Dimon has entrusted Pinto with running the most volatile part of JPMorgan and dealing with the biggest corporate clients. A native of Argentina, Pinto spends much of his time working from JPMorgan's London office. Doug Petno, who runs commercial banking, is another possible contender. With $212 billion in assets, his segment of the company is bigger than all but a handful of competitors. The 51-year-old came up through the ranks as lender and investment banker to the oil and gas industry. Mary Erdoes, 49, who runs asset management, is also said to be in the running. Erdoes keeps a relatively low public profile as she travels the world to cater to the richest clients. Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, who is 47, is also floated as a possibility. Lake already has a high profile, because she handles public presentations of the bank's financial results each quarter and has shown she can be as dextrous with numbers as Dimon. But while Lake is known internally for grasping the details behind summaries she receives from business heads, she has not run any of JPMorgan's units day to day. Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames is the youngest contender, at 46. In his role, he has the advantage of learning all segments of the bank from the inside out. Dimon turned to Zames in early 2012 to clean up the portfolio of the bad "London Whale" derivatives trader that was costly not only in dollars but in reputation. Zames came from fixed-income trading, and has worked through financial crises going back to 1998. 'I DON'T WANT TO RETIRE' Dimon has said JPMorgan has a "deep bench" of talent, with several people who could take over. But he has been careful not to clearly show favorites. When all goes right with succession plans, companies tend to announce a few months ahead of time that their leaders will be relinquishing the CEO title to a successor but remain on the board as chairman for a smooth transition. During the interim, other executives in the horse race tend to peel off, letting up-and-comers take over their own roles. JPMorgan has resolved nearly all of its major legal investigations. Dimon received a clean bill of health after undergoing cancer treatment. And, apparently, he has no plans to join Trump's cabinet. So unless an unexpected event forces his hand, Dimon may not feel compelled to tell investors who is next. "My retirement date, every time you ask me that, I'm going to say five years," Dimon said in response to a question last year. "I don't want to retire."

The authorities alleged that the bank hired relatives and friends of Chinese government officials to secure banking deals, the US Department of Justice said in a statement. US Assistant Attorney General Caldwell said: “Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple.  “This case demonstrates the Criminal Division’s commitment to uncovering corruption no matter the form of the scheme.” Beginning in 2006, senior Hong Kong-based investment bankers set up and used the “Sons and Daughters Program,” to hire candidates referred by clients and government officials. The US authorities said that the program was used as a means to influence those same officials to award investment deals to JP Morgan APAC.  By late 2009, JPMorgan executive and senior bankers revamped the program to give priority to the candidates linked to upcoming client transactions. The Justice Department’s statement said that a referred candidate in the revised program had to have a “directly attributable linkage to business opportunity” to get hired. Many of those hire performed ancillary work such as proofreading and provided little real value to any deliverable product, it said. Despite that, the candidates hired during the scheme were typically given the same titles and paid the same amount as entry-level investment bankers. According to the statement, the corrupt scheme has resulted in at least $35m in profits for JP Morgan. Of the total penalty, JP Morgan agreed to pay $130.5m in disgorgement to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including prejudgment interest.

Tech to aid fertility Business Beat More Business »   Vying for lucrative deals in China, JPMorgan Chase deployed all the usual wining-and-dining tactics that big banks use to woo clients. JPMorgan, federal authorities now say, also had ways of sweetening the deal that crossed a legal line. Federal prosecutors and regulators announced on Thursday a settlement of roughly $264 million with the bank and its Hong Kong subsidiary, accusing them of a vast foreign bribery scheme that may have spread to a number of Wall Street banks. The case centered on JPMorgan’s­ hiring practices in China, where it is accused of hiring the children of Chinese leaders to win business in the fast-growing nation. Some of the well-connected candidates were unqualified, authorities said, and often “performed ancillary work” — telltale signs of hidden bribery. The case could lay the groundwork for authorities to pursue penalties against other big banks as well. Banks including HSBC, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank have hinted that they face investigations into their hiring practices in China as part of a larger sweep by the agency that began in 2013. “We do not expect this to be the last action resulting from that sweep,” Andrew Ceresney, the head of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, told reporters Thursday. The bank argued that the hiring of well-connected employees was routine in China, and that its own hires fell into a gray area of foreign bribery laws. But the prosecutors and regulators say that as JPMorgan­ hired more and more candidates based on referrals from Chinese leaders, senior bankers in several instances explicitly tied those jobs or internships to securing deals with Chinese government-run companies. To be hired, a referred candidate had to have, in the bank’s own words, a “directly attributable linkage to business opportunity,” a scheme that enabled the company to win or retain business resulting in more than $100 million in revenue, prosecutors said. “The common refrain that this is simply how business is done overseas is no defense,” said Robert Capers, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. “This is no longer business as usual; it is corruption.” Still, authorities acknowledged that JPMorgan­ cooperated extensively with the investigation and they lowered the penalty accordingly. The bank, authorities stated, also disciplined nearly two dozen employees and “took significant employment action” that led to the departure of six employees who participated in the misconduct. “We’re pleased that our cooperation was acknowledged,” a JPMorgan spokesman, Brian Marchiony, said. “The conduct was unacceptable.” “We stopped the hiring program in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved,” he added.

JPMorgan agreed to $264 million in fines, an amount discounted in return for the bank’s cooperation with the investigations. The bank acknowledged wrongdoing as part of the settlement — an unusual admission in such cases. Facing a competitive business environment, JPMorgan hired candidates, who usually were unqualified, for internships and full-time jobs at the prestigious bank, the largest in the U.S. by assets. In some cases the applicants were referred by Chinese government officials and the employment would be extended if the relationship generated enough revenue, according to court documents. The case is just the first of what law enforcement officials expect to be several delving into the conduct of U.S. banks operating in China. The JPMorgan case shows that this may “be an industrywide problem,” said Andrew Ceresney, director of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission. “We do not expect this to be the last action related to this sweep.” JPMorgan said it has made improvements to its hiring practices and was pleased that its cooperation was recognized by law enforcement officials. “The conduct was unacceptable. We stopped the hiring program in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved,” JPMorgan said in a statement. The case centers on hiring practices in JPMorgan’s Hong Kong business. Between 2006 and 2013 the bank developed a referral program for applicants connected to business or government officials that could land JPMorgan work. Those applicants were allowed to bypass the usual hiring process and did not have to compete against more qualified candidates based on merit, according to court documents. The arrangement was so explicit that JPMorgan employees created a spreadsheet to track the revenue brought in from clients who made referrals.

Others were given shorter-term employment unless the business contact offered additional work to JPMorgan. About 200 interns and full-time employees were hired as part of the scheme, including nearly 100 referred by Chinese government officials. Bank employees knew that they were potentially violating the law, but persisted in the conduct for more than six years, said Ceresney of the SEC. The bank was involved in a “systematic bribery scheme,” he said. More Business Cozy retirement?

The Department of Justice called the scheme "bribery by any other name" and said it threatened national security. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Justice Department (DoJ) began an investigation in 2013. The bank will pay the SEC $130m for violations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It is also expected to pay $72m to the US Justice Department and $61.9m to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. http://www.bbc.com/news/business-38013723 A11608543165 View Public Profile Send a private message to A11608543165 Find all posts by A11608543165 « Previous Thread | Next Thread » Thread Tools Search this Thread Show Printable Version Email this Page Search this Thread: Advanced Search Display Modes Linear Mode Switch to Hybrid Mode Switch to Threaded Mode Posting Rules You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Forum Rules Forum Jump User Control Panel Private Messages Subscriptions Who's Online Search Forums Forums Home Work     Just Talk     AsiaOne Contests     Politics     ShowBiz / Entertainment     Tech         General news         News and comments             Phones and Telcos             Computers and Software             Internet             Bad Tech Deals             How Tos         MarketPlace             Trading             Buying & Selling         Reviews             Phones and Gadgets             Computers and Cameras             Consoles, Games and Software             Services and Others         Innovations     Health         News         Cancer         Health costs         Sexual Health         Letters to the press         Feedback & Comments     Business         News         Daily Frustrations         Jobs         Money         SME Central         Tech Sense     Property         News         Property Market         Housing agents         The Wanted List     Worklife     Regional & World News         Asia             Asia News             South East Asia             China             Japan             Malaysia         World         World News     Singapore     Crime     Show Your Pics     Sports         Singapore sports         Football         Tennis         Golf         International events & other sports         Scandals, rumours and gossip     Motoring         Motor Talk             Public transport             Hot Fumes             Motor Mouths             Formula One racing             Taxi Tales             Motoring Classifieds             Complaint Corner             Diesel Motoring         Motor Announcements         Technical             Motor Tech             Help!             I.C.E.         Chatroom             Saloons             Hatchbacks             MPVs             SUVs             Coupes / Cabriolets Live     SoShiok.com         Dining Experience             Cafes, Bistros / Other Eateries         Hawker food         Wine & Beverages         Desserts & Titbits         Recipes         To Market, To Market         Coffee Shop Talk         Discounts, Offers, Credit Card Promos, Contests! & More!!     Travel         News and issues         Airlines         Hotels         Flight crew         Tips and advisories         Tourism in Singapore         Vacation stories         Deals to steal Play     Diva         News         love sos             Issues and views             Dating & Relationship tips             Marriages gone bad         parenthood             Motherhood             The Mummy Diaries         people watch             Celebrities talk         make me over             Contests and giveaways!             Latest beauty products to hit the shelves             Style Guide             Weddings             Health & wealth         Let's talk             Just Woman     Education         News         Schoops         Students, teachers & parents         Learning institutions         General     Helpdesk Powered by vBulletin® Version 3.8.6 SPH DIGITAL NEWS / ASIAONE GROUP / Copyright ©2014 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd .

The SEC and Justice Department had been investigating over several years whether some of JPMorgan’s hiring efforts involved bribes, in violation of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The SEC will receive US$130 million of the settlement, with US$72 million going to Justice and US$61.9 million to the US Federal Reserve, which penalised the bank “for unsafe and unsound practices.” JPMorgan did not admit or deny the charges. As part of its settlement with the Justice Department, a Hong Kong unit of the bank admitted to making quid pro quo hiring agreements with Chinese officials to win investment business. JPMorgan is the first major bank to settle a case over the hiring of “princelings,” as the offspring and other relatives of top Chinese officials are popularly known. In recent years, several other banks, including HSBC and Goldman Sachs, have said their hiring practices in Asia were under scrutiny by US authorities. The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it a crime to bribe overseas officials to win business, even if the payments are non-monetary. A JPMorgan spokesman said in an email: “The conduct was unacceptable.” The hiring programme was halted in 2013 and the bank took actions against those responsible, the spokesman said. Authorities said JPMorgan’s Asia unit created an elaborate programme, called “Sons and Daughters,” that allowed clients and influential government officials to recommend potential hires. Those candidates received preferential treatment, bypassing JPMorgan’s normal recruitment practices, the SEC said. Between 2006 and 2013, JPMorgan hired around 200 interns and full-term employees at the request of its Asia clients, as well as Chinese officials at state-owned companies. Those state-owned companies brought JPMorgan more than US$100 million in revenue, the SEC said. For example, in urging the hiring of one candidate, a JPMorgan banker said, “It will strengthen our relationship” with a client and solidify “our position as an advisor to him and the IPOs of his companies (expected to be >US$500mm in offering size,” according to SEC’s order. Quid pro quo business arrangements remain an entrenched part of business culture in China that is very hard to avoid, said Alex Bourelly, who leads the SEC enforcement practice at the law firm Baker Botts LLP. Local staff members who have many government contacts know they can be quickly hired elsewhere if they are caught and fired for making improper payments, Bourelly said. “US law has its limits in terms of how it can affect the behaviour of people around the world,” he said. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Asia to narrow trade focus as protectionism rises, say analysts Five ways Indians are dodging ‘black money’ crackdown Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Palm oil celebrates centennial, output doubles every 10 years TPP, RCEP, FTAAP: A user’s guide to alphabet soup of trade deals Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Tensions’ likely under President-elect Trump, Obama says Reuters Video: Trump says ‘you will hear some things tomorrow’ Reuters Video: At least 60 dead in India train derailment MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Related Articles Banks, brokers gird for Brexit-style tumult following US election Year’s busiest week for US IPOs offers little comfort to banks Wall Street sets another record as JPMorgan leads banks higher JPMorgan post-Brexit plan hinges on tone of discourse in Europe Clouds over Britain’s financial sector after Brexit vote (VIDEO) Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest. Photo Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times 1. A flurry of potential Cabinet members visited Trump Tower in New York throughout the day. According to one of his transition team, Donald J. Trump has offered the post of national security adviser to Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, a retired intelligence officer who believes that Islamic militancy is an existential threat to the West. Signs increased that Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s 35-year-old son-in-law, is looking to join the administration. Mr. Trump supports the idea, according to two people briefed on the discussions. ____ Photo Credit Al Drago/The New York Times 2. As they try to recover from their stunning election defeat, Democrats may try a surprising strategy: aligning with Mr. Trump. They will try to work with him on areas of common interest: infrastructure spending, child tax credits and dismantling trade agreements.

In his acceptance speech, Colson Whitehead, the author, said he was drawing comfort in these politically uncertain times by focusing on the redeeming power of art. “We’re happy in here; outside is the blasted hellhole wasteland of Trumpland,” he said. “Be kind to everybody, make art and fight the power.” ____ Photo Credit Sam Hodgson for The New York Times 7. We’re still taking a close look at the mayhem that erupted in Chicago over Memorial Day weekend, when 64 people were shot in a three-day period at the start of a bloody summer. Only one of those killed was female, and she was the youngest victim. Veronica Lopez wanted to escape the city’s violence, but died at just 15 years old. Her Sweet 16 was held at her grave. ____ Photo Credit Ozan Kose/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images 8. Turkey’s accelerating shift toward authoritarianism, in hyperdrive since a failed coup attempt in July, has taken a huge toll on free speech.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION Certain information contained in this press release, including any information as to the company's strategy, projects, plans or future financial or operating performance, constitutes "forward-looking statements". All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. The words "expect", "will", "may" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by the company or Barrick North America Finance LLC as at the date of this press release in light of management's experience and perception of current conditions and expected developments, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements and information. Such factors include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold, copper or certain other commodities (such as silver, diesel fuel, natural gas and electricity); failure to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations; timing of receipt of, or failure to comply with, necessary permits and approvals; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development; changes in mineral production performance, exploitation and exploration successes; diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; increased costs, delays, suspensions and technical challenges associated with the construction of capital projects; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or development activities, including geotechnical challenges and disruptions in the maintenance or provision of required infrastructure and information technology systems; the impact of global liquidity and credit availability on the timing of cash flows and the values of assets and liabilities based on projected future cash flows; the impact of inflation; fluctuations in the currency markets; changes in U.S. dollar interest rates; changes in national and local government legislation, taxation, controls or regulations and/or changes in the administration of laws, policies and practices, expropriation or nationalization of property and political or economic developments in Argentina, Canada, the United States and other jurisdictions in which the company does or may carry on business in the future; lack of certainty with respect to foreign legal systems, corruption and other factors that are inconsistent with the rule of law; damage to the company's reputation due to the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, including negative publicity with respect to the company's handling of environmental matters or dealings with community groups, whether true or not; risk of loss due to acts of war, terrorism, sabotage and civil disturbances; litigation; contests over title to properties, particularly title to undeveloped properties, or over access to water, power and other required infrastructure; risks associated with working with partners in jointly controlled assets; employee relations including loss of key employees; increased costs and physical risks, including extreme weather events and resource shortages, related to climate change; and availability and increased costs associated with mining inputs and labor. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion, copper cathode or gold or copper concentrate losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks). Many of these uncertainties and contingencies can affect the company's actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the company or Barrick North America Finance LLC. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.

(REUTERS/Lucas Jackson) Automated teller machines aren’t just a source of cash. They’re also a way for scientists to understand what microbes are in the environment and on people’s fingers— such as mold from sugary food. For a new study, researchers took samples in the summer of 2014 from the keypads of 66 ATMs in New York City, and then analyzed what they found. They discovered microbes that live on human skin, as well as in places like bathrooms, kitchens, pillows, and evidence of food like chicken, fish, and mold from baked goods. “Our results suggest that ATM keypads integrate microbes from different sources, including the human microbiome, foods, and potentially novel environmental organisms adapted to air or surfaces,” Jane Carlton, director of the Center for Genomics and Systems Biology at NYU and the senior author of the new study, said in a statement. The cash machines they studied were scattered across the city, from Manhattan to Queens to Brooklyn, and four of them were outside, although they didn’t see anything different with those ATMs compared to the inside ones. RECORD-BREAKING BATS CAN FLY AS FAST AS 99 MPH, STUDY SAYS While the majority of microbes came from unknown sources, and then from surfaces like televisions or restrooms, they were also able to identify microbes that came from human skin, ears, noses, and feces. Interestingly, in places like midtown Manhattan, they found mold that’s connected with baked goods— called X. bisporus, the fungus is “associated with spoilage of high-sugar foods such as cakes and confectionaries,” according to the study. While the researchers can’t be sure exactly where the mold came from, they have an idea: “it seems plausible that this fungus had been transferred from people who had recently handled baked goods, particularly in a commuter-heavy area such as midtown Manhattan, where there are many nearby convenience stores and cafés selling this type of food product to business workers,” the researchers write in the study. Ultimately, the study, which was published in the journal mSphere, provides a snapshot of what people have been doing, as well as microbes that come from the urban environment.

His supervisor in Asia told colleagues that “he’s not really built” for investment banking. He had “attitude issues,” had trouble “following basic rules” and was a prolific napper. Yet in 2010 he was offered a full-time job, over the reservations of some executives. In an email, a banker said the hire would curry favor with the student’s father, an executive of a Taiwanese company who was offering an $800 million transaction to the bank. “The quid pro quo is an analyst job for his son,” the banker wrote. Those details emerged on Thursday as JPMorgan agreed to pay about $264 million to settle U.S. allegations that it hired children of Chinese decision-makers to win business in violation of anti-bribery laws. “Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple,” Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said. The agreement ended an almost three-year investigation that set off a debate on Wall Street over whether U.S. business standards should be applied in foreign countries and whether favors to influential officials amounted to criminal activity. The bank will pay about $130 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission, $72 million to the Justice Department and $62 million to the Federal Reserve. Neither JPMorgan nor individual employees are being prosecuted. Such leniency reflects the bank’s willingness to quickly turn over records and change global policies to eliminate questionable hiring practices at the start of the inquiry, U.S. officials said. The Justice Department’s fraud section started a pilot program this year meant to reduce fines and sanctions in exchange for full cooperation, and the SEC says it reduces penalties or forgoes punishment altogether for companies that cooperate. “We’re pleased that our cooperation was acknowledged in resolving these investigations,” JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said in a written statement. “The conduct was unacceptable. We stopped the hiring program in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved. We have also made improvements to our hiring procedures and reinforced the high standards of conduct expected of our people.” The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is also investigating JPMorgan’s hiring practices in China, people familiar with the situation have said. In the government’s 21-page agreement with JPMorgan, U.S. officials outlined a years-long scheme in which JPMorgan employees at the bank’s Hong Kong subsidiary sought to maximize profits by providing jobs and internships to children of individuals it hoped to do business with. At least $35 million in JPMorgan’s profits could be attributed to the hiring practices detailed in the agreement, U.S. officials said. JPMorgan engaged in the activity, which it called the Sons and Daughters Program, from 2006 to at least 2012 even though the bank had an anti-corruption policy designed to avoid any “quid pro quo arrangement,” investigators said. “Certain senior executives and employees of the company conspired to engage in quid pro quo agreements with Chinese officials to obtain investment-banking business,” they said. This included creating a program “to provide specific personal benefits to senior Chinese officials in the position to award or influence the award of banking mandates.” Bank employees took steps to avoid attracting the attention of authorities that possible anti-bribery laws were being violated. Paperwork about the hiring was doctored or altered “to conceal the corrupt arrangement” and avoid detection, prosecutors said. Federal prosecutors in the office of the Brooklyn U.S. attorney, Robert Capers, described at least six clients that the bank’s Asia unit sought to cultivate as part of the scheme, including a state-owned financial services firm; a private Chinese manufacturing company; the Taiwanese private holding company; a state-owned Chinese bank and financial services firm; the deputy minister of a Chinese government agency and the executive vice president of a state-owned and controlled Chinese bank. U.S. officials didn’t name any of the individuals or companies involved in the program. Prosecutors cited a series of e-mails JPMorgan officials exchanged during the years-long scheme. In November 2009, for example, a JPMorgan executive in Asia suggested that the bank institute a practice of prioritizing “hires linked to upcoming transactions.” A managing director observed in September 2009 that “people in other investment banks are doing a better job. Therefore, in theory, we can accommodate more powerful sons and daughters that could benefit the entire platform.” Another e-mail discussed making hires “directly attributable linkage to business opportunity.” The JPMorgan settlement was constructed as a kind of “roadmap” for other companies willing to self-report and provide full cooperation into foreign corruption investigations, people with knowledge of the situation have said. The Justice Department is still investigating at least five other unidentified Wall Street banks to see if they’d hired relatives of influential Chinese officials or executives of state-run enterprises to help obtain business or as a reward for steering business their way, two of the people said. They also looked at whether that hiring ran afoul of 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it a crime to pay or give other benefits to a foreign government official. Prosecutors in the JPMorgan case cited several lackluster hires who got jobs as a result of their ties to decision-makers in Asia. For example, a JPMorgan supervisor asked if an entry-level investment banker was producing “real investment banking productivity” or “is he a photocopier?” “Photocopier,” the bank supervisor replied, nevertheless recommending later that the employee should be promoted, saying, “The deal is large enough we’d be crazy not to accommodate her father’s wants.” Another prospective hire, whose father was a deputy minister at a Chinese government agency, got a job with the bank’s Asia offices even though some bankers said “he was the worst business analyst candidate they had ever seen,” an executive wrote in an e-mail. Despite managers’ misgivings about the son of the Taiwanese company executive, the napping intern joined the bank’s staff in New York, prompting one banker to write, “Happy young man, and his dad will also be very pleased.” Three months later, JPMorgan won the company’s business, prosecutors said. The father “certainly followed through,” a bank employee wrote.

The deal will settle charges that it hired friends and relatives of Chinese officials in order to gain access to banking deals in that country. JPMorgan's Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo programme that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of qualifications, in order to gain favour and win banking deals. The bank will avoid criminal bribery charges as part of the deal reached with the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators in the US. The bank reached what is known as a non-prosecution agreement over the allegations. "Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple," assistant attorney general Leslie Caldwell said. The United States has one of the strictest bribery laws in the world, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, where it effectively bans US companies from paying foreign government officials to obtain or retain business. While JPMorgan did not pay Chinese officials directly, federal authorities said the hiring of unqualified persons related to Chinese officials was effectively the same thing. The only candidates who would fall under this programme had to have a "directly attributable linked to business opportunity" to be considered for hiring. The Department of Justice estimates the Asia affiliate of JPMorgan earned at least $35m in profits from Chinese state-owned companies. Ms Caldwell called the JPMorgan programme, which was called the Sons and Daughters Programme, was "nothing more than bribery by another name". Despite those strong words, the bank will avoid criminal bribery charges as part of the deal. The Justice Department said it agreed to the non-prosecution agreement due in part to JPMorgan's own cooperation in the case, where the bank undertook an internal investigation and fired six employees tied to the program and disciplined another 23 employees for their involvement. "We're pleased that our cooperation was acknowledged in resolving these investigations," said JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony. "The conduct was unacceptable. We stopped the hiring programme in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved." According to the terms of the deal, JPMorgan has agreed to pay $72m to the Department of Justice as well as $130.5m in penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It will also pay $61.9m to the Federal Reserve in civil penalties.

In a multi-year investigation, the SEC and Justice Department had been probing whether JPMorgan’s hires constituted bribes in violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The SEC will receive $130 million of the settlement, with $72 million going to Justice and $61.9 million to the Fed, which penalized the bank "for unsafe and unsound practices."JPMorgan did not admit or deny the charges. As part of its settlement with the Justice Department, a Hong Kong unit of the bank admitted to making quid pro quo hiring agreements with Chinese officials to win investment business. JPMorgan is the first major bank to settle a case over the hiring of "princelings," as the offspring and other relatives of top Chinese officials are popularly known. In recent years, several other banks including HSBC (HSBA.L) and Goldman Sachs [GSGSC.UL] have said their hiring practices in Asia are under scrutiny from U.S. authorities. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it a crime to bribe overseas officials to win business, even if the payments are non-monetary. A JPMorgan spokesman said in an email: “the conduct was unacceptable.” The hiring programme was halted in 2013 and the bank took actions against those responsible, the spokesman said. Authorities said JPMorgan’s Asia unit created an elaborate programme called “Sons and Daughters,” that allowed clients and influential government officials to recommend potential hires. Those candidates received preferential treatment, bypassing JPMorgan’s normal recruitment programme, the SEC said. Between 2006 and 2013, JPMorgan hired around 200 interns and full-term employees at the request of its Asia clients and Chinese officials from state-owned companies. Those state-owned companies brought JPMorgan more than $100 million in revenue, the SEC said.For example, in pushing for one job candidate a JPMorgan banker said, “It will strengthen our relationship” with a client and solidify “our position as an advisor to him and the IPOs of his companies (expected to be >$500mm in offering size,” according to SEC’s order.

(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)   NEW YORK—JPMorgan Chase & Co. has agreed to pay $264.4 million in fines to federal authorities to settle criminal and civil charges that it hired friends and relatives of Chinese officials in order to gain access to banking deals in that country. JPMorgan’s Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo program that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of the person’s qualifications, in order to gain favor and win banking deals. “Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple,” Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said in prepared remarks. The United States has one of the strictest bribery laws in the world, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, where it effectively bans U.S. companies from paying foreign government officials to obtain or retain business. While JPMorgan did not pay Chinese officials directly, federal authorities said the hiring of unqualified persons related to Chinese officials was effectively the same thing. The only candidates who would fall under this program had to have a “directly attributable linked to business opportunity” to be considered for hiring. The Department of Justice estimates the Asia affiliate of JPMorgan earned at least $35 million in profits from Chinese state-owned companies. Caldwell called the JPMorgan program, which was called the “Sons and Daughters Program,” was “nothing more than bribery by another name.” Despite those strong words, the bank will avoid criminal bribery charges as part of the deal reached with the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators. The bank reached what’s known as a non-prosecution agreement over the allegations. The Justice Department said it agreed to the non-prosecution agreement due in part to JPMorgan’s own cooperation in the case, where the bank undertook an internal investigation and fired six employees tied to the program and disciplined another 23 employees for their involvement. “We’re pleased that our cooperation was acknowledged in resolving these investigations,” said JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony in a statement. “The conduct was unacceptable. We stopped the hiring program in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved.” According to the terms of the deal, JPMorgan has agreed to pay $72 million to the Department of Justice as well as $130.5 million in penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It will also pay $61.9 million to the Federal Reserve in civil penalties, making it combined $264.4 million.

The Department of Justice called the scheme ‘bribery by any other name’.

The settlement with US regulators comes after a three-year investigation into a vast foreign bribery scheme that violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). It could be the first of several such deals with Wall Street banks. “JP Morgan engaged in a systematic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials and other favoured referrals who were typically unqualified for the positions on their own merit,” said Andrew Ceresney, director of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) enforcement division. “JP Morgan employees knew the firm was potentially violating the FCPA yet persisted with the improper hiring program because the business rewards and new deals were deemed too lucrative.” The Department of Justice called the scheme “bribery by any other name” and said it had recently created three dedicated international corruption squads “to combat this type of quid pro quo, and we’ll use all resources at our disposal to uncover and put an end to these crimes”. Starting in 2006 senior Hong Kong-based JP Morgan bankers set up and used a “client referral programme”, also referred to as the “sons and daughters programme”, to hire candidates referred by clients and government officials. The bank admitted that some candidates hired under the scheme did little more than proof reading but were paid the same amount as entry-level investment bankers. In one case bankers in New York told their Hong Kong peers that one Chinese hire was unqualified to be an investment banker. But a senior Chinese official had said that his hiring would help JP Morgan secure a lucrative role in an upcoming initial public offering (IPO) of a state-owned company. A position was created for the candidate in New York, and JP Morgan thereafter obtained a leading role in the IPO. JP Morgan Chase to pay $307m for steering investors toward own products Read more The DoJ calculates the scheme increased profits at JP Morgan by at least $35m. “US businesses cannot lawfully seek to gain a business advantage by corruptly influencing foreign government officials,” said US attorney Robert Capers of the eastern district of New York. “The common refrain that this is simply how business is done overseas is no defence. In this case, JP Morgan employees designed a programme to hire otherwise unqualified candidates for prestigious investment banking jobs solely because these candidates were referred to the bank by officials in positions to award business to the bank. In certain instances, referred candidates were hired with the understanding that the hiring was linked to the award of specific business. This is no longer business as usual; it is corruption.” Kara Brockmeyer, chief of the SEC enforcement division’s FCPA unit, said: “The misconduct was so blatant that JP Morgan investment bankers created ‘referral hires vs revenue’ spreadsheets to track the money flow from clients whose referrals were rewarded with jobs. The firm’s internal controls were so weak that not a single referral hire request was denied.” A JPMorgan spokesman said in an email: “The conduct was unacceptable.” The hiring program was halted in 2013 and the bank took actions against those responsible, the spokesman said.

Regulators slapped JPMorgan with $264 million in fines and said the bank “corruptly influenced government officials” with its hiring and internship tactics in China. The settlement follows a three-year investigation into JPMorgan and marks one of the first major crackdowns on a big U.S. bank for running afoul of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Known as the FCPA, the law prohibits companies from making payments or giving “anything of value” to win business from foreign officials. “JPMorgan engaged in a systemic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials … who were typically unqualified for the position on their own merit,” Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC’s enforcement division, said in a statement. The practice of giving the children of China’s ruling class plum jobs and internships was so common at JPMorgan that the bank even had a formal program known as “Sons and Daughters.” The program included spreadsheets that tracked how often the hires turned into business deals. “The so-called Sons and Daughters program was nothing more than bribery by another name,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney General Leslie Caldwell. She called it “corruption, plain and simple.” Over the course of seven years, JPMorgan hired about 100 interns and full-time employees at the request of foreign government officials, according to authorities. These jobs scored JPMorgan more than $100 million in business. JPMorgan admitted to authorities that individuals hired during the scheme were given the same titles and paid the same amount as entry-level investment bankers. That’s despite the fact that, according to the DOJ, they mostly focused on routine work such as “proofreading” and generated little actual business. JPMorgan’s $264 million in fines is being divided up among multiple government agencies. The bank has agreed to pay more than $130 million to the SEC, $72 million to the Justice Department and $62 million to the Federal Reserve. Despite the “blatant” conduct alleged by authorities, the U.S. did not announce any criminal charges against JPMorgan itself nor any individual employees of the bank. In a statement, JPMorgan said the hiring practices were “unacceptable” and the program was stopped in 2013. The bank said it took “action” against the individuals involved and has since improved its hiring procedures. JPMorgan also said in a filing that it continues to cooperate on other related investigations that are “ongoing.” The SEC said it continues to investigate the issue. Authorities say the hirings were quid pro quo arrangements expressly made with the intent to win business. For instance, the DOJ said that in late 2009 a Chinese official told a senior JPMorgan banker in Asia that hiring a referred candidate would significantly influence the role JPMorgan would play in an upcoming IPO of a Chinese state-owned company. JPMorgan then spent months trying to place the candidate in a New York investment banking position — despite realizing he was not qualified. The SEC said JPMorgan’s internal controls were “so weak” that not one of these hiring requests was denied. The settlement comes as JPMorgan’s CEO, Jamie Dimon, has been floated as a potential treasury secretary in the Trump administration. It’s also the latest black eye for Wall Street and big banks. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo outraged Americans by saying it fired 5,300 employees for creating as many as 2 million fake accounts. The scandal dealt a blow to Wells Fargo’s reputation and resulted in the sudden retirement of longtime CEO John Stumpf. JPMorgan itself has also been in trouble in recent years. In 2013, JPMorgan paid $5.1 billion to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac linked to misdeeds in the run up to the housing bubble. JPMorgan was also hit with a $1 billion fine for improper oversight that led to the London Whale trading debacle. Regulators worry the misbehavior among bankers is causing a credibility problem for the industry. “Deep-seated cultural and ethical problems,” New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley recently warned,” have “eroded the industry’s trustworthiness.” Smart friendship bracelet gets girls into coding Facebook is well aware that it can influence elections Related Posts Google under siege: Europe wants blood Yahoo soars on Alibaba spinoff Wells Fargo ad to feature a lesbian couple Google X hopes to launch drone deliveries by 2017 Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

JPMorgan's Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo program that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of the person's qualifications, in order to gain favor and win banking deals. "Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple," Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said in prepared remarks. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The United States has one of the strictest bribery laws in the world, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, where it effectively bans U.S. companies from paying foreign government officials to obtain or retain business. While JPMorgan did not pay Chinese officials directly, federal authorities said the hiring of unqualified persons related to Chinese officials was effectively the same thing. Caldwell called the JPMorgan program, which was called the "Sons and Daughters Program," was "nothing more than bribery by another name." The bank will avoid criminal bribery charges as part of the deal reached with the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators. The bank reached what's known as a non-prosecution agreement over the allegations. The Justice Department said it agreed to the non-prosecution agreement due in part to JPMorgan's own cooperation in the case, where the bank undertook an internal investigation and fired six employees tied to the program and disciplined another 23 employees for their involvement. According to the terms of the deal, JPMorgan has agreed to pay $72 million to the Department of Justice as well as $130.5 million in penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It will also pay $61.9 million to the Federal Reserve in civil penalties, making it combined $264.4 million.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Op-ed: Should Mormons who voted for Trump get temple recommends?

JPMorgan's Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo program that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of the person's qualifications, in order to gain favor and win banking deals. "Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple," Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said in prepared remarks. The United States has one of the strictest bribery laws in the world, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, where it effectively bans U.S. companies from paying foreign government officials to obtain or retain business. While JPMorgan did not pay Chinese officials directly, federal authorities said the hiring of unqualified persons related to Chinese officials was effectively the same thing. The only candidates who would fall under this program had to have a "directly attributable linked to business opportunity" to be considered for hiring. The Department of Justice estimates the Asia affiliate of JPMorgan earned at least $35 million in profits from Chinese state-owned companies. Caldwell called the JPMorgan program, which was called the "Sons and Daughters Program," was "nothing more than bribery by another name." Despite those strong words, the bank will avoid criminal bribery charges as part of the deal reached with the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators. The bank reached what's known as a non-prosecution agreement over the allegations. The Justice Department said it agreed to the non-prosecution agreement due in part to JPMorgan's own cooperation in the case, where the bank undertook an internal investigation and fired six employees tied to the program and disciplined another 23 employees for their involvement. "We're pleased that our cooperation was acknowledged in resolving these investigations," said JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony in a statement. "The conduct was unacceptable. We stopped the hiring program in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved." According to the terms of the deal, JPMorgan has agreed to pay $72 million to the Department of Justice as well as $130.5 million in penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It will also pay $61.9 million to the Federal Reserve in civil penalties, making it combined $264.4 million. ___ Ken Sweet covers banks and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

Credit Andrew Burton/Getty Images After more than three years of digging into JPMorgan Chase’s hiring practices in China, federal authorities have determined that the bank hired the children of Chinese leaders as part of a quid pro quo to win business in the booming nation, clearing the way for a costly punishment. As soon as Thursday, the authorities will announce a roughly $264 million settlement with the bank and its Hong Kong subsidiary, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The authorities, which include criminal prosecutors and civil regulators, will accuse the bank of orchestrating a long-running foreign bribery scheme. When The New York Times reported on the contours of a settlement in September, it was not known whether the authorities would explicitly accuse the bank of carrying out a quid pro quo — providing jobs in exchange for lucrative assignments from Chinese government-run companies. This issue, which strikes at the heart of whether JPMorgan violated United States law governing foreign bribery, became a focal point of the investigation and the ensuing settlement negotiations. The bank argued that the hiring of well-connected employees was routine in China, and that its own hires fell into a gray area of foreign bribery laws. The United States government, however, concluded that in several instances, senior JPMorgan bankers explicitly linked those jobs or internships to securing deals with Chinese government-run companies, the people briefed on the matter said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story JPMorgan, the people said, formalized the hiring into what it called the Sons and Daughters program. The bank even went so far as to create spreadsheets that tracked its hires to specific clients — and the bank’s ability to convert these hires into business deals. In reaching the settlement, JPMorgan is expected to accept the findings and conclusions of the investigators. A spokesman for JPMorgan declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the Justice Department’s criminal division in Washington and the United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve, which handled the civil regulatory aspects of the investigation, declined to comment. The settlement, which was smaller than once expected because JPMorgan showed a high degree of cooperation with investigators, followed a painful period for the bank. When the China hiring investigation first came to light in a front-page article in The Times three years ago, it added to a growing list of regulatory problems, including the $6 billion “London whale” trading scandal and a $13 billion settlement with the Justice Department over the bank’s sale of mortgage securities in the years before the 2008 financial crisis. The China settlement will now put to rest one of the last big regulatory headaches for the bank. Some of the senior bankers suspected of carrying out the hiring have since left JPMorgan. Just as important, the agreement signals the final chapter in the Obama administration’s pursuit of wrongdoing on Wall Street. That effort garnered big-dollar settlements and splashy headlines, but no criminal prosecutions of top Wall Street executives after the financial crisis — an absence that has drawn much criticism and public debate. The foreign bribery case against JPMorgan is no different. The United States attorney’s office in Brooklyn and the Justice Department’s criminal division in Washington are expected to impose a roughly $70 million penalty on the bank but will not charge any of the bankers who doled out the jobs. The S.E.C. will assess the largest punishment, about $130 million of the overall $264 million settlement, while the Fed will impose a roughly $62 million penalty. The bank also secured a moral victory by avoiding criminal charges, the people briefed on the matter said, and instead negotiated a rare nonprosecution agreement.

Steve Bannon, a media executive appointed as Mr. Trump’s chief White House strategist, lamented in 2014 that “not one criminal charge has ever been brought to any bank executive” associated with the 2008 crisis. Mr. Trump’s presidency also could be a turning point in how banks and other corporations do business in China. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump called China a “currency manipulator” and threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, but as president-elect he has shifted his tone and promised that the two nations would have “one of the strongest relationships.” No matter the relationship going forward, the Justice Department is expected to continue enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act — the 1977 law that underpins the case against JPMorgan — and that might mean more cases against big banks operating in China. The JPMorgan case would represent one of the first major crackdowns on a big bank for violations of this law, but Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC and other banks have also hinted that they face investigations into their hiring practices in China. Those investigations may fizzle, but the JPMorgan case provides a template for prosecutors and regulators to bring these sorts of cases, which once seemed far-fetched. JPMorgan’s lawyers urged prosecutors not to criminalize hiring practices that were common in the region. While hiring an American politician’s child in exchange for a government contract is a clear violation of law, global companies routinely hire the sons and daughters of leading Chinese politicians. JPMorgan went even further, however, and hired the family members of potential clients while seeking their business. Specifically, JPMorgan hired the children of Chinese officials running state-controlled companies that were seeking banks to help them go public. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act essentially bars United States companies from giving “anything of value” to a foreign official to win “an improper advantage” in retaining business. Initially, JPMorgan sought to prevent such violations. But as the Sons and Daughters program expanded, senior JPMorgan bankers explicitly tied those hires to securing deals with Chinese government-run companies, the people briefed on the matter said. In an email previously reported by The Times, a JPMorgan executive in Hong Kong linked one prominent hire to “existing and potential business opportunities” from a Chinese government-run company. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The executive also described the broader benefits of the hiring program, telling colleagues in another email: “You all know I have always been a big believer of the Sons and Daughters program — it almost has a linear relationship” with winning assignments to advise Chinese companies.

The nation's biggest bank will avoid criminal bribery charges as part of the deal reached with the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. has agreed to pay $264.4 million in fines to federal authorities to settle charges that it hired friends and relatives of Chinese officials in order to gain access to banking deals in that country The bank reached what's known as a non-prosecution agreement over the allegations.

The SEC, JPMorgan and the Justice Department all declined to comment. The settlement was first reported by Bloomberg. It will end a probe into whether the bank's hires violated U.S. anti-bribery laws, Bloomberg said.  As the settlement was announced, there was conflicting information on whether JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon could become U.S. Treasury secretary as part of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet. As the settlement was announced, there was conflicting information on whether JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon  (pictured) was being considered as the next U.S. Treasury secretary as part of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet Tweets from Fox Business News reporters on Wednesday were the latest indication that Dimon was still in the running for the job. But initial word from anchor Maria Bartiromo that he would 'get' the job was quickly knocked down. JPMorgan spokespeople have declined to make any official comment about the idea of Dimon joining the Trump administration since November 10, when reports first surfaced that he was a contender for Treasury secretary. Dimon declined to comment through a representative on Wednesday. A Trump transition team source told Reuters that Dimon is 'pitching hard' for the Treasury role.    Share or comment on this article e-mail 93 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Girl won right to be frozen just days before dying Scrapped!

JPMorgan's Asia affiliate allegedly created a quid pro quo program that would hire the children and friends of high-ranking Chinese officials, regardless of the person's qualifications, in order to gain favor and win banking deals. "Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple," Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said in prepared remarks. The United States has one of the strictest bribery laws in the world, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, where it effectively bans U.S. companies from paying foreign government officials to obtain or retain business. While JPMorgan did not pay Chinese officials directly, federal authorities said the hiring of unqualified persons related to Chinese officials was effectively the same thing. The only candidates who would fall under this program had to have a "directly attributable linked to business opportunity" to be considered for hiring. The Department of Justice estimates the Asia affiliate of JPMorgan earned at least $35 million in profits from Chinese state-owned companies. Caldwell called the JPMorgan program, which was called the "Sons and Daughters Program," was "nothing more than bribery by another name." Despite those strong words, the bank will avoid criminal bribery charges as part of the deal reached with the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators. The bank reached what's known as a non-prosecution agreement over the allegations. The Justice Department said it agreed to the non-prosecution agreement due in part to JPMorgan's own cooperation in the case, where the bank undertook an internal investigation and fired six employees tied to the program and disciplined another 23 employees for their involvement. "We're pleased that our cooperation was acknowledged in resolving these investigations," said JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony in a statement. "The conduct was unacceptable. We stopped the hiring program in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved." According to the terms of the deal, JPMorgan has agreed to pay $72 million to the Department of Justice as well as $130.5 million in penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission. It will also pay $61.9 million to the Federal Reserve in civil penalties, making it combined $264.4 million. ___ Ken Sweet covers banks and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

(Photo: Seth Wenig, AP) JPMorgan Chase & Co. has agreed to pay about $264 million to settle corruption charges that accused the investment bank of seeking to influence Chinese government officials by giving jobs and internships to their friends and relatives, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department announced Thursday. The investment bank, which was subject to civil and criminal investigations stemming from its hiring practices in Hong Kong and China, is specifically accused of violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), a federal law that prohibits bribing foreign officials. Hoping to gain more banking business, bankers in JPMorgan's offices in Hong Kong bypassed the firm's normal hiring practices and hired about 100 interns and full-time employees who were referred by foreign government officials in a seven-year period, starting 2006. The officials had ties to more than 20 state-owned enterprises, the SEC said. Calling the practice "a systematic bribery scheme," Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC enforcement division, said the candidates were "typically unqualified for the positions on their own merit." Candidates hired through the so-called "Sons and Daughters Program" were typically given the same titles and paid the same amount as entry-level investment bankers, but performed "ancillary work such as proofreading and provided little real value to any deliverable product," according to the Justice Department. USA TODAY JPMorgan, Citi glide past profit expectations JPMorgan bankers in Hong Kong were aware that they were potentially violating the FCPA in creating the program, but continued it because "the business rewards and new deals were deemed too lucrative," Ceresney said. JPMorgan will pay more than $130 million for the charges from the SEC. The company is also expected to pay $72 million to the Justice Department and $61.9 million to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. As part of the settlement with the Justice Department, JPMorgan will not face prosecution and has agreed to continue to cooperate with any ongoing investigations. "The conduct was unacceptable," JPMorgan said in a statement. "We stopped the hiring program in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved.  We have also made improvements to our hiring procedures, and reinforced the high standards of conduct expected of our people." The crackdown on JPMorgan is part of the SEC's broader investigation of U.S. companies' hiring practices in the region, where family ties and other allegiances can play a significant role in job search among the political and social elites. JPMorgan's case "could be an industry wide problem," Ceresney said in a conference call with reporters. "We do not expect this to be the last case resulting from this sweep." The practice, which enabled JPMorgan to generate more than $100 million in revenue, was so blatant that its investment bankers created "Referral Hires vs Revenue" spreadsheets to track the money flow from clients who managed to get jobs for their referrals, according to Kara Brockmeyer, chief of the SEC enforcement division's FCPA unit. In order to be hired, a referred candidate had to have a direct link to a business opportunity. USA TODAY JPMorgan's Dimon says it's time for a rate hike, sees no economic "potholes" "The firm’s internal controls were so weak that not a single referral hire request was denied," Brockmeyer said. "In certain instances, referred candidates were hired with the understanding that the hiring was linked to the award of specific business," United States Attorney Robert Capers of the Eastern District of New York said in a statement. "This is no longer business as usual; it is corruption.” In one case cited by the Justice Department, a Chinese government official told a senior JPMorgan banker in Asia in 2009 that hiring a referred candidate could result in JPMorgan landing a prominent role in an upcoming initial public offering of a Chinese state-owned company. Despite being told that the candidate was not qualified, JPMorgan bankers hired the candidate in New York, resulting in the company landing a leading role in the IPO. 44 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2fA47Cq

His supervisor in Asia told colleagues that “he’s not really built” for investment banking. He had “attitude issues,” had trouble “following basic rules” and was a prolific napper. Yet in 2010 he was offered a full-time job, over the reservations of some executives. Those details emerged on Thursday as JPMorgan agreed to pay about $264 million to settle U.S. allegations that it hired children of Chinese decision-makers to win business in violation of anti-bribery laws. Investigators described a systematic effort to curry favor with government officials and business executives. The Wharton student’s father was an executive of a Taiwanese company offering an $800 million transaction to the bank. In an e-mail, one banker wrote, “The quid pro quo is an analyst job for his son.” The government’s 21-page agreement with JPMorgan ended an almost three-year investigation that set off a debate on Wall Street over whether U.S. business standards should be applied in foreign countries and whether favors to influential officials amounted to criminal activity. U.S. officials said JPMorgan employees at the bank’s Hong Kong subsidiary sought to maximize profits by providing jobs and internships to children of individuals it hoped to do business with. In spite of a company policy prohibiting such quid pro quo, employees kept a spreadsheet that tracked the recruits and the revenue attributable to each one -- and then doctored or altered paperwork about the hiring activity “to conceal the corrupt arrangement.” In all, the bank generated at least $35 million in profits as a result of those hires, U.S. officials said. “Awarding prestigious employment opportunities to unqualified individuals in order to influence government officials is corruption, plain and simple,” Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said. The bank will pay about $130 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission, $72 million to the Justice Department and $62 million to the Federal Reserve. Neither JPMorgan nor individual employees are being prosecuted. Such leniency reflects the bank’s willingness to quickly turn over records and change global policies to eliminate questionable hiring practices at the start of the inquiry, U.S. officials said. The Justice Department’s fraud section started a pilot program this year meant to reduce fines and sanctions in exchange for full cooperation, and the SEC says it reduces penalties or forgoes punishment altogether for companies that cooperate. Earlier: U.S. Offers Incentives for Companies to Self-Report Corruption “We’re pleased that our cooperation was acknowledged in resolving these investigations,” JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said in a written statement. “The conduct was unacceptable. We stopped the hiring program in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved. We have also made improvements to our hiring procedures and reinforced the high standards of conduct expected of our people.” The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is also investigating JPMorgan’s hiring practices in China, people familiar with the situation have said. JPMorgan shares were up more than 0.75 percent to $77.98 at 1 p.m. in New York. ‘Quid Pro Quo’ JPMorgan engaged in the activity, which it called the Sons and Daughters Program, from 2006 to at least 2012 even though the bank had an anti-corruption policy designed to avoid any “quid pro quo arrangement,” U.S. officials said. “Certain senior executives and employees of the company conspired to engage in quid pro quo agreements with Chinese officials to obtain investment-banking business,” they said. This included creating a program “to provide specific personal benefits to senior Chinese officials in the position to award or influence the award of banking mandates.” Cultivating Clients Federal prosecutors in the office of the Brooklyn U.S. attorney, Robert Capers, described at least six clients that the bank’s Asia unit sought to cultivate as part of the scheme, including a state-owned financial services firm; a private Chinese manufacturing company; the Taiwanese private holding company; a state-owned Chinese bank and financial services firm; the deputy minister of a Chinese government agency and the executive vice president of a state-owned and controlled Chinese bank. U.S. officials didn’t name any of the individuals or companies involved in the program. Prosecutors cited a series of e-mails JPMorgan officials exchanged during the years-long scheme. In November 2009, for example, a JPMorgan executive in Asia suggested that the bank institute a practice of prioritizing “hires linked to upcoming transactions.” A managing director observed in September 2009 that “people in other investment banks are doing a better job. Therefore, in theory, we can accommodate more powerful sons and daughters that could benefit the entire platform.” Another e-mail discussed making hires “directly attributable linkage to business opportunity.” The JPMorgan settlement was constructed as a kind of “roadmap” for other companies willing to self-report and provide full cooperation into foreign corruption investigations, people with knowledge of the situation have said. Other Inquiries The Justice Department is still investigating at least five other unidentified Wall Street banks to see if they’d hired relatives of influential Chinese officials or executives of state-run enterprises to help obtain business or as a reward for steering business their way, two of the people said. They also looked at whether that hiring ran afoul of 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it a crime to pay or give other benefits to a foreign government official. Prosecutors in the JPMorgan case cited several lackluster hires who got jobs as a result of their ties to decision-makers in Asia. For example, a JPMorgan supervisor asked if an entry-level investment banker was producing “real investment banking productivity” or “is he a photocopier?” “Photocopier,” the bank supervisor replied, nevertheless recommending later that the employee should be promoted, saying, “The deal is large enough we’d be crazy not to accommodate her father’s wants.” Another prospective hire, whose father was a deputy minister at a Chinese government agency, got a job with the bank’s Asia offices even though some bankers said “he was the worst business analyst candidate they had ever seen,” an executive wrote in an e-mail. Despite managers’ misgivings about the son of the Taiwanese company executive, the napping intern joined the bank’s staff in New York, prompting one banker to write, “Happy young man, and his dad will also be very pleased.” Three months later, JPMorgan won the company’s business, prosecutors said. The father “certainly followed through,” a bank employee wrote. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Report: Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Says No To Being Trump’s Treasury Secretary Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Report: Chase CEO Jamie Dimon Says No To Being Trump’s Treasury Secretary November 17, 2016 9:34 am EST By Chris Morran@themorrancave dimon in the rough jamie dimon secretary of the treasury donald trump jpmorgan chase Last week, rumors circulated that Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase CEO whom President-elect Donald Trump had once called the “worst banker in the United States,” was being considered by the incoming Trump administration for the position of Secretary of the Treasury. However, a new report claims that Dimon has formally passed on the offer. According to Fortune.com, Dimon opted to stay on at Chase rather than accept the cabinet position, feeling he wasn’t quite suited for the gig. As the report notes, the CEO is well-known — if not infamous — for his outspoken ways, a personality that may work in the banking world, but might not fit in well with a job where you have to constantly answer to the White House, lawmakers, and the public. Barring a dark horse nominee that no one has discussed yet, this leaves Trump transition adviser, and former Goldman Sachs exec Steve Mnuchin as the most likely person to be named for the Treasury gig. Bloomberg recently reported that he is the favorite for the gig among Trump’s advisors, with bank-backed Texas Congressman Jeb Hensarling — perhaps the legislator most intent on dismantling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — and investor Wilbur Ross Jr. as possible nominees.

By David Dayen November 17, 2016 Illustration by Hanna Barczyk Ever since Wall Street bankers cratered the global economy in 2009, federal prosecutors have barely been able to keep up with the unprecedented scale of corporate wrongdoing. Last year, in a series of high-profile settlements, Citicorp, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, and the Royal Bank of Scotland agreed to pay more than $2.5 billion in criminal fines for manipulating the exchange rates on foreign currencies. Credit Suisse forked over $1.1 billion for helping its wealthy clients evade taxes. And the Justice Department ripped up an earlier settlement with UBS and fined the Swiss bank more than $200 million for rigging interest rates. As critics have pointed out, such penalties are little more than chump change for Wall Street, especially compared to the enormous profits that big banks have raked in from their criminal activities. But even if the punishment doesn’t fit the crime, the record-setting fines levied by the Justice Department are still flooding federal coffers with billions of new dollars. Which raises the question: Where is all the money going? The answer, it turns out, is the Crime Victims Fund, a little-known pool of money created during the law-and-order push of the 1980s to assist victims of crime, much of it violent. All criminal fines paid by individuals or corporations are deposited directly into the fund, which in turn flows to states to support individual victims and the organizations that assist them: battered women’s shelters, counseling centers for abused children, families who lost their primary breadwinners to murder, victims left permanently disabled by violent assaults. America’s biggest corporate criminals, in short, are paying to help the victims of other criminals. Thanks to a wave of big-dollar settlements with banks and pharmaceutical companies, the Crime Victims Fund ballooned from approximately $3 billion at the end of 2009 to almost $12 billion by the end of 2014. The Justice Department collected $23 billion in fines last year—but only $2.6 billion made its way into the Crime Victims Fund. The problem is, the fund only receives money from criminal fines. And in most cases, the Justice Department has been letting big banks and other corporate criminals off the hook with civil settlements and deferred prosecution agreements. Those settlements, instead of going into the Crime Victims Fund, mostly get handed over to the Treasury to reduce the deficit. Of the $23 billion in fines the Justice Department collected last year, in fact, only $2.6 billion made its way into the Crime Victims Fund. That means the feds aren’t just letting banks and top executives off easy for defrauding customers—they’re shortchanging victims of murder, sexual assault, and child abuse. “No one of any importance has spent time in jail for the massive fraud that the Justice Department outlines in horrifying detail in deferred prosecution agreements,” says Bart Naylor, a financial policy advocate for the nonprofit consumer rights group Public Citizen. “Not only does this invite more crooks into this risk-free racket, it deprives crime victims of any relief.” When the Crime Victims Fund was established in 1984 as part of the Victims of Crime Act, few lawmakers in Washington resisted the chance to help sympathetic crime victims. A task force appointed by President Ronald Reagan heard from crime survivors who suffered from deep psychological trauma and crippling medical bills. Disabled assault victims lost their means of support. Others had trouble getting time off from work to testify against their tormentors, or struggled to return to everyday life, plunging them into financial distress. Even navigating assistance programs required experienced help. The main sponsors of the victims fund were Strom Thurmond, the archconservative senator, and Peter Rodino, the liberal congressman. “In an era of Reaganism and budget constraints, it was an extremely bipartisan initiative,” says Steve Derene, executive director of the national association of state agencies that administer the fund. Unfortunately, the way Congress set up the fund effectively makes much of the money off-limits to crime victims. As criminal prosecutions have increased in recent years, the fund has grown to record levels. Because deposits into the fund can vary wildly from year to year based on criminal settlements, Congress caps the amount the fund can disperse on an annual basis, leaving money for leaner times. The cap was initially set at $500 million. As the fund has expanded, Congress has gradually raised the cap—up to $745 million in 2014, then to $2.4 billion in 2015. But that still leaves a huge unspent sum that service organizations desperately need to support crime victims. “There’s $9 billion sitting there with a specific purpose in mind,” says Meg Garvin, executive director of the National Crime Victim Law Institute. “Meanwhile, victim services can’t pay their rent.” That huge reserve of cash, however, has turned out to be too big a temptation for Congress to resist. Last year, for the first time, lawmakers raided the fund, taking $1.5 billion from crime victims to help pay for their own spending measures. And the looting has continued. This year, Congress plans to divert $379 million from the fund to support programs designed to curb violence against women—a worthy cause, but one that is supposed to receive its own funding. Other proposals would transfer 5 percent of grants from the fund to tribal governments, or commandeer a portion of the money to support a Republican move to rein in the Justice Department. “A lot of programs that represent different areas would like to get their slice of the fund,” Derene says. There is another solution. If the Justice Department actually did its job and prosecuted corporate wrongdoers to the full extent of the law, there would be more than enough money in the fund to aid crime victims. What’s more, Congress could help victims of Wall Street’s own fraud by doing away with the ineffective “consumer relief programs” that the Justice Department inserts into civil settlements. Those programs often end up helping the banks more than the customers they cheated, allowing them to profit even further by selling off the homes of their victims. If money from consumer relief programs went into the Crime Victims Fund, it would be overseen by social service professionals who know how to help victims, rather than by federal prosecutors looking to make headlines. But such reforms are unlikely to happen without a push by victim advocates. For now, lawmakers appear more interested in robbing the Crime Victims Fund than in helping victims of robbery. “This is a social problem,” says Garvin. “You have a huge swath of communities suffering from victimization. We made the decision decades ago to support those communities. Now we’re abandoning them.” Read More Up Front, Magazine, December 2016, Politics, Wall Street, assault, Ronald Reagan, Reaganism, Victims Fund Sign up for your daily dose of politics, culture, and big ideas.

Tweets from Fox Business News reporters on Wednesday were the latest indication that Dimon was still in the running for the job. But initial word from anchor Maria Bartiromo that he would "get" the job was quickly knocked down. JPMorgan spokespeople have declined to make any official comment about the idea of Dimon joining the Trump administration since Nov. 10, when reports first surfaced that he was a contender for treasury secretary. Dimon declined to comment through a representative on Wednesday. A Trump transition team source told Reuters that Dimon is "pitching hard" for the treasury role. However, two other sources indicated that he is not interested. One said Dimon has told colleagues since Nov. 8, when Trump won the election, that he would not take the role. The three sources spoke on the condition of anonymity. Bartiromo cited a meeting on Thursday where a decision will be made on either Dimon or Steve Mnuchin, who was Trump's campaign finance manager, as treasury secretary. Her colleague Charles Gasparino said Dimon would only be willing to play an advisory role. Fortune reported later that Dimon has already said no. Whatever the outcome, speculation about his departure from JPMorgan rattled some investors. Dimon has run JPMorgan for a decade and is viewed as a torchbearer for Wall Street. He does not have a clear successor. "He is one of the best CEOs in the industry and corporate America, so if there were to be a quick departure that would be troubling," said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Management, which owns JPMorgan shares. "It is very difficult to replace someone like him." JPMorgan's shares closed down 2.5 percent at $77.40 on heavy volume, though much of the move came before the treasury speculation heated up. Although Dimon has said repeatedly and publicly that he would not want to be treasury secretary, it is rare to reject a president-elect's request to join his Cabinet. Doing so could put JPMorgan in an awkward position, because it would then be regulated by an administration Dimon spurned. But if Dimon did take the job, it is not clear who would step in as CEO. Several senior executives' names have been floated in the past as potential successors, including Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames and heads of business units such as Gordon Smith, Douglas Petno and Daniel Pinto, but none has been identified by the bank or insiders as being the clear choice to take over as CEO.

It’s also a potential boon for Wall Street banks, which have quietly bankrolled these companies as they profit from detaining and incarcerating people.   A new report released today by In The Public Interest reveals that six major Wall Street firms work in tandem with the industry: financing its debts, servicing its bonds, and extending billions of dollars in credit to pay for its operating expenses and expansion into related markets, like selling ankle GPS systems to monitor immigrants.  By acting as a credit card for private prisons, those six banks — Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, US Bancorp and Wells Fargo — help the prison companies avoid corporate taxes. That doesn’t sit well with Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat. He’s been trying to push legislation that would make it harder for private prison companies to keep registering themselves as Real Estate Investment Trusts — entities that pay low tax rates, keep little cash on hand, and borrow heavily from banks. “It is wrong for private enterprises to bring a profit motive to incarceration and rehabilitation in this country, and I’m particularly concerned by how it’s fueled by tax laws,” Sen. Wyden told International Business Times. “In my view, most taxpayers would be disturbed to learn that their dollars are subsidizing corporate profits from the mass incarceration of minority and low-income Americans.” Activists working to reduce the incarcerated population also criticized Wall Street for profiting  from the expansion of the prison system. “These banks are embedded in our communities,” said Amanda Aguilar Shank, deputy director of Enlace, a coalition of activists who oppose for-profit detension. “At the same time they are financing prison expansion — the institutions that are tearing our communities apart. This is sickening.” The banks behind the prison industry, of course, see things differently. “We do not as a corporation take positions on public policy issues that do not directly affect our company’s ability to serve customers and support team members,” Ruben Pulido, VP of corporate communications at Wells Fargo, told IBT. “We have banking relationships with tens of thousands of companies in hundreds of different sectors, and we only do business with companies that have demonstrated a strong, ongoing commitment to complying with all applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.” The number of prisoners in privately-run prisons has exploded since 1990, from just under 7,000 to over 131,000. The facilities have at times been plagued by public scandal. In 2012, a federal judge called a prison that GEO Group later took over a “cesspool of unconstitutional and inhuman acts and conditions,” and in 2014 the head of the Mississippi prison system was charged with accepting bribes from private prison companies. (He pleaded guilty on related charges.) The ACLU has repeatedly sued CoreCivic for allegedly poor conditions in its facilities. And this past August, the Obama administration announced it would cease the use of private prisons for federal prisoners. This moratorium did not apply, however, to detained immigrants. Under the Obama administration, private facilities have become the go-to solution for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which now holds 73 percent of its detainees in for-profit detention centers. Last week, Trump suggested he could deliver a major business opportunity to the companies that profit off detaining immigrants: He suggested one of his top priorities would be to detain or deport some 2- to 3 million undocumented immigrants.  Critics say that private prisons rely on mass incarceration to be profitable, and that the industry lobbies for punitive and draconian laws to keep its facilities full. Aguilar Shank called the private prisons “a parasite that has to constantly expand.” She said the industry spends millions lobbying Congress to fund immigration enforcement agencies, and has indirectly supported harsh sentencing guidelines.   Geo Group did not respond to IB Times request for comment, but CoreCivic disputed that characterization. “It is CoreCivic's longstanding policy not to draft, lobby for, promote or in any way take a position on proposals, policies or legislation that determine the basis or duration of an individual’s incarceration or detention,” Jonathan Burns, a company spokesman, told IBT. “The primary focus of CoreCivic's lobbying efforts is to educate lawmakers on the benefits of public-private partnership generally and the solutions that CoreCivic provides.”  Public-private partnerships aside, CoreCivic and GEO Group would have no way to finance their operations without the financial industry's backing. “They need Wall Street to survive, given their business model,” Benjamin Davis, a researcher with In The Public Interest, told IBT. “They are dependent on the debt.” Last year, for example, GEO Group bought SoberLink Inc — a tech company that allows authorities to monitor alcohol use remotely — with a $25 million credit line from Bank of America, JPMorgan  Chase, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, US Bancorp and Wells  Fargo. GEO Group doesn’t rely on Wall Street-financed debt because it’s pressed for cash — the private-prison industry generates more than a billion dollars in annual revenue. The industry finances its operations through debt in order to take advantage of a tax loophole.   Both Core Civic and GEO Group classified themselves as “Real Estate Investment Trusts” (REIT), a tax status originally intended for companies that profit from buying and renting of land. The REIT classification allows the industry to effectively avoid corporate taxes — but it also requires them to treat investors as if they were part-owners in a real-estate trust. So the for-profit prison companies must pay out 90 percent of its profits to shareholders, leaving very little cash on hand. That’s where Wall Street comes in. Davis combed through the SEC filings and found that, as of June 2016, CoreCivic owed $1.5 billion to Wall Street and GEO Group owed $1.9 billion. The debt is spread throughout a range of financial mechanisms including revolving credit, long-term loans, and bond issuance. At every step of the way, Wall Street banks cash in: In 2015 alone, CoreCivic and GEO Group paid out over $150 million in interest and handed over $10 million for bond-servicing fees. On top of that, the Wall Street banks operate a consortium to provide revolving credit to both GEO Group and CoreCivic: Both can access up to $900 million set aside by the banks. SEC filings do not make clear how much the Wall Street firms charge to keep the credit line open. Related Stories President-Elect Trump's Wall Street Circle President-Elect Trump's For-Profit Incarceration State During the course of the presidential campaign, the private prison industry surfaced as an major issue: Under pressure from activists, Hillary Clinton returned donations from GEO Group and eventually called for the end of for-profit detention. Trump charted a different course; the president-elect's Super PAC took in $100,000 from GEO Group, and he praised the industry on the campaign trail. “I do think we can do a lot of privatizations and private prisons,” Trump told Chris Matthews last March. “It seems to work a lot better.” “GEO group might be licking its lips right about now,” says Davis. “Trump's talking tough on crime, deportations, national stop and frisk — many signs point to a momentum shift towards more private prisons.” And investors are taking note. The day after the election, the Wall Street Journal cited GEO Group as a “stock to watch.” In the week since Trump’s victory, both CoreCivic and Geo Group’s stock prices have soared, at times rising as much as 40 percent higher than their pre-election value.   Correction: 11/17, 12:15 pm EST: This story has been changed to correct the number of prisoners in private facilities. National More Political Capital Trump’s Hate-Love Relationship With Goldman Sachs By Avi Asher-Schapiro The president-elect slammed campaign opponents for their ties to the financial industry giant.

By KERI GEIGER, MATT ROBINSON AND PATRICIA HURTADO Bloomberg News First Published Nov 17 2016 01:05AM    •    Last Updated Nov 17 2016 01:05 am Share This Article U.S. authorities are preparing to announce as soon as Thursday that JPMorgan Chase & Co. will pay about $200 million to settle allegations that it hired children of Chinese decision makers to win business, according to people familiar with the matter. The agreement would end a nearly three-year investigation into whether the hires violated U.S. anti-bribery laws. The highly publicized probe set off a debate on Wall Street over whether U.S. business standards should be applied in foreign countries and whether favors to influential officials amounted to criminal activity. Neither JPMorgan nor individual employees are being prosecuted, the people said. Such leniency reflects the bank's willingness to quickly turn over records and change global policies to eliminate questionable hiring practices at the start of the inquiry, several people familiar with the matter have said. VIDEOS TOP JOBS The bank will pay about $130 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission and about $70 million to the Justice Department, the people said. Both authorities offer reduced sanctions to companies that assist in investigations. The Justice Department's fraud section started a pilot program this year meant to reduce fines and sanctions in exchange for full cooperation, and the SEC says it reduces penalties or forgoes punishment altogether for companies that cooperate. Spokesmen for JPMorgan, the Justice Department and the SEC declined to comment. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are also investigating JPMorgan's hiring practices in China, people familiar with the situation have said. The JPMorgan settlement was constructed as a kind of "roadmap" for other companies willing to self-report and provide full cooperation into foreign corruption investigations, two of the people said. For two decades, Wall Street banks have led the way in taking Chinese companies public overseas, taking advantage of their global reach and ability to ensure billions of dollars of stocks get sold at premium prices. The Justice Department is still investigating at least five other unidentified Wall Street banks to see if they'd hired relatives of influential Chinese officials or executives of state-run enterprises to help obtain business or as a reward for steering business their way, two of the people said. They also looked at whether that hiring ran afoul of 1977 Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which makes it a crime to pay or give other benefits to a foreign government official. The challenge for authorities was to discern whether such relationships were coincidental or an improper quid-pro-quo. The U.S. has clamped down on corporate favors to foreign officials, which are tacitly permitted or even encouraged in some countries. Goldman Sachs hired children of senior executives at China Petrochemical Corp., known as Sinopec Group, and New China Life Insurance Co. Morgan Stanley brought in an analyst whose father is both a top official of China National Pharmaceutical Group Corp., or Sinopharm, and the chairman of China National Building Material Co. Spokesmen for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES Op-ed: Should Mormons who voted for Trump get temple recommends?

November 17 2016 at 09:39am By David Henry and Steve Holland REUTERS JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon. File picture: Dylan Martinez New York/Washington - Conflicting information on whether JPMorgan Chase & Company Chief Executive Jamie Dimon could become US Treasury secretary as part of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet cast a cloud of uncertainty over the nation's largest bank on Wednesday. Tweets from Fox Business News reporters on Wednesday were the latest indication that Dimon was still in the running for the job. But initial word from anchor Maria Bartiromo that he would “get” the job was quickly knocked down. JPMorgan spokespeople have declined to make any official comment about the idea of Dimon joining the Trump administration since November 10, when reports first surfaced that he was a contender for Treasury secretary. Dimon declined to comment through a representative on Wednesday. A Trump transition team source told Reuters that Dimon is “pitching hard” for the Treasury role. However, two other sources indicated that he is not interested. One said Dimon has told colleagues since November 8, when Trump won the election, that he would not take the role. The three sources spoke on the condition of anonymity. Bartiromo cited a meeting on Thursday where a decision will be made on either Dimon or Steve Mnuchin, who was Trump's campaign finance manager, as Treasury secretary. Her colleague Charles Gasparino said Dimon would only be willing to play an advisory role. Fortune reported later that Dimon has already said no. Whatever the outcome, speculation about his departure from JPMorgan rattled some investors. Dimon has run JPMorgan for a decade and is viewed as a torchbearer for Wall Street. He does not have a clear successor. “He is one of the best CEOs in the industry and corporate America, so if there were to be a quick departure that would be troubling,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital Management, which owns JPMorgan shares. “It is very difficult to replace someone like him.” JPMorgan's shares closed down 2.5 percent at $77.40 on heavy volume, though much of the move came before the Treasury speculation heated up. Although Dimon has said repeatedly and publicly that he would not want to be Treasury secretary, it is rare to reject a president-elect's request to join his Cabinet. Doing so could put JPMorgan in an awkward position, because it would then be regulated by an administration Dimon spurned. But if Dimon did take the job, it is not clear who would step in as CEO. Several senior executives' names have been floated in the past as potential successors, including Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames and heads of business units such as Gordon Smith, Douglas Petno and Daniel Pinto, but none has been identified by the bank or insiders as being the clear choice to take over as CEO.

The bank is likely to pay about $130 million to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and about $70 million to the Justice Department. It would also pay more than $50 million to the Federal Reserve. Individual employees may not be prosecuted at this time. Bloomberg reported that the U.S. authorities would announce the proposed settlement as soon as on Thursday. This would end a three- year long probe into whether the bank's hires violated US anti-bribery laws. The settlement is much smaller than once expected due to JPMorgan's high degree of cooperation with investigators. The authorities reportedly offer reduced sanctions to those companies that fully co-operate and assist in investigations. It was in 2013 that the SEC opened an investigation into JPMorgan over the allegations. The Justice Department also opened a parallel investigation. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are also investigating the bank's hiring practices. The bank reportedly argued that in China it is common to employ well-connected people, and that these hires come under the foreign bribery laws. In China, investment banks generally favor to employ children of political leaders, as close ties to top government officials play a critical role in business decisions in that country. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Preview: Thanksgiving Week Economic Data Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories The Most Influential Books In Business Previous Story Next Story More Top Stories Fiat Chrysler Recalls Cars For Wiper, Fuel Leak Issues Stocks Move Modestly Lower Amid Quiet Trading Day - U.S. Commentary Dupont Will No Longer Contribute To Pensions Fitch Warns On Trump Trade Policies Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary Trump Taps Sessions As AG, Pompeo As CIA Director, Flynn As Security Advisor Stocks Showing A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary U.S. Leading Economic Index Inches Higher For Second Straight Month Sen Sessions To Be Attorney General, Gen Flynn Touted As NSA: Reports CFO Shake-up For Actuant Ohio Congressman Challenges Nancy Pelosi For House Dem Leader Japanese Prime Minister Abe Says He Has Great Confidence In Trump Stocks May Show A Lack Of Direction In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Trump Reportedly Picks Sen.

Ware   |   Nov. 16, 2016 at 9:58 PM Follow @upi Comments | License Photo NEW YORK, Nov. 16 (UPI) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co. has reportedly reached an agreement with federal authorities to pay more than $250 million to settle accusations that it effectively bribed Chinese officials -- with offers of employment for relatives -- to win lucrative business in the densely-populated nation. The settlement, which would be split among federal government agencies, could be announced as early as Thursday, the New York Times reported late Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Committee have been investigating JPMorgan's hiring practices in China for nearly three years, trying to determine whether they violated anti-bribery laws. RECOMMENDEDAugust: Ex-JPMorgan Chase V.P. guilty on 9 counts of insider trading According to sources, authorities found that the bank offered to hire the adult children of Chinese officials in exchange for new business, news reports said. People familiar with the investigation said that practice was called the "Sons and Daughters Program." The Times report said the settlement amount will be around $264 million, and will be paid by the bank and a Hong Kong subsidiary. Regulators and Justice officials are expected to accuse JPMorgan of the long-running bribery scheme in their announcement. However, the sources said, neither JPMorgan nor individual employees will be prosecuted criminally as a result of the probe. It's believed the bank was fully cooperative with the government's review. RECOMMENDEDAugust: JPMorgan Chase to pay $446K to ex-inmates over debit card program JPMorgan has argued that hiring well-placed employees and interns in China is a common practice in the expansive nation. As part of the reported settlement, though, the bank will agree to accept the investigation's findings and conclusions, the Times reported. Bloomberg reported that about $130 million will be paid to the SEC and $70 million to the Justice Department. The Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are also investigating, Bloomberg's report said. JPMorgan Chase did not comment on the matter Wednesday.

After Fox anchor Maria Bartiromo tweeted that Dimon “will get” the position, her colleague Charles Gasparino tweeted that Dimon does not want the job but would be willing to play an advisory role. Bartiromo later said that Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc partner who was campaign finance manager for President-elect Donald Trump, is also a contender and that a decision will be made at a meeting today. A Trump transition team source told Reuters that Dimon is “pitching hard” for the Treasury role. Another source said Dimon was not interested in the job. Both spoke on condition of anonymity. JPMorgan's shares closed down 2.5 per cent at US$77.40 (RM337.40) on heavy volume. The question of whether Dimon would leave the bank to become Treasury secretary first arose on Nov 10, when news broke that a member of Trump's transition team had reached out to Dimon to gauge his interest in the role. Although Dimon has said repeatedly and publicly that he would not want the job, it is rare to say “no” to a president-elect's request to join his cabinet. Doing so would also put Dimon and JPMorgan in an awkward position, because the bank would then be regulated by an administration Dimon rejected. But if Dimon were to take the job, it is not clear who would replace him as CEO. Several senior executives' names have been floated in the past as potential successors, including chief operating officer Matt Zames and heads of business units such as Gordon Smith, Douglas Petno and Daniel Pinto, but none has been identified by the bank or insiders as being the clear choice to take over as CEO. Separately, yesterday a source told Reuters that JPMorgan would pay about US$200 million (RM871.75 million) combined to settle probes by the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission into hiring in China. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Asia to narrow trade focus as protectionism rises, say analysts Five ways Indians are dodging ‘black money’ crackdown Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Palm oil celebrates centennial, output doubles every 10 years TPP, RCEP, FTAAP: A user’s guide to alphabet soup of trade deals Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia’s central bank says will no longer tolerate ringgit trade in NDF market Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: ‘Tensions’ likely under President-elect Trump, Obama says Reuters Video: Trump says ‘you will hear some things tomorrow’ MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Mahathir, Siti Hasmah head to KLCC by car MMOTV: Red Shirts heckle yellow-shirted Bersih participants Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Related Articles US business moguls urge ‘commonsense’ governance approach JPMorgan CEO buys more than US$25m of company shares Bank of China top-paid executive said to quit as China lenders come to grips with slowing economy JPMorgan’s Dimon says US banks healthy, Europe lagging JPMorgan’s board takes some power from Dimon Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 19 November 2016 Choppy market, challenging returns by manokaran mottain MALAYSIANS consumers have been pinched as sentiments on the ground feel that income increases do not correspond with the rising cost of living. Since the middle of 2014, the government has been reducing the subsidy bill, from 18.1% of operating expenditure in 2014 to an estimated 10.4% in Budget 2017, in an effort to shrink its fiscal deficit. Consequently, the latest third quarter Malaysian consumer sentiments index tracked by the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research fell to 73.6 after a brief rebound to 78.5 during the previous quarter; the index level below 100 point suggests bearish consumer outlook. As a result, consumers appear to be more prudent with their expenditure. From the latest third quarter gross domestic product (GDP) release, private consumption growth slowed to 0.2% on quarter-on-quarter basis, down from 0.7% quarter-on-quarter expansion registered during the second quarter. Against current external and domestic macro tantrums, how should households adapt and preserve their hard earned savings and capital? According to Bank Negara, in 2015, aggregate household financial assets grew by RM97.9bil to RM2.1 trillion. Bank Negara remains confident of household balance sheet resilience as household financial asset to household debt ratio remained above two times in the past five years. Deposit instruments form the largest component of household financial assets at 43%. In the past five years, inflation rate averaged 2.4% per annum while inflation-adjusted median household income growth expanded 9.1% per annum between 2012 and 2014. Although a top down view of these statistics could indicate resilience in household consumption, the state of household balance sheet would determine the middle and longer time domestic demand outlook. At the microeconomic level, household savings are essential for children’s education, retirement plans and general well-being of living standards. > Defensive play in domestic market A fundamental investment strategy is to hold a diverse portfolio of assets that generate decent return that corresponds with the investor’s appetite for volatility. During times of choppy markets and uneven global macro conditions, investors still adopting a top down approach in asset selections should give due consideration of their strategy. The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index return has contracted 3.7% since the beginning of the year until mid-November on the back of challenging domestic business conditions and dampened international financial market appetite. Meanwhile, the JPMorgan Asian Dollar Index which tracks Asian currency exchange rates against the US dollar, have been volatile and depreciated 2.2% between the start of the year and mid-November. Headwinds in global macroeconomic conditions following the uncertainty of the Brexit fallout and the surprise win of Republican candidate Donald Trump for the US Presidency against the market favoured Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton have been negative developments for the emerging markets. With clouded visibility of uptick in fundamental macro of domestic demand and private investment appetite – in most of the economies around the world – households with appetite for exposure in equities would have to tread carefully depending on the region and the supporting macro factors. On the other hand, investments into Malaysian sovereign bond registered pocket of positive returns this year. Listed in Bursa Malaysia is a fixed income Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that provides exposure to Malaysian government bonds. Since the beginning of the year, the ETF would have generated an annualised return of around 8.1% at its peak in early October. Therefore, this shows that it is essential to identify macro trends and allocate portfolio holdings accordingly. This dull asset class of fixed income managed to outperform the domestic equity index this year. On the other hand, the government has been pushing for a retail presence in the domestic debt market, including the Islamic bond sukuk market. The Securities Commission has developed a framework for retail bonds and sukuk in its Capital Market Masterplan 2 for selected issuers to sell debts either through the Bursa exchange or over-the-counter via appointed banks. This allows greater participation for investors with direct access in trading bonds and sukuk, instead of relying on unit trust funds for fixed income exposures. > Don’t forget to save and invest However, at the end of the day, households with heightened risk aversion might decide to be cash position dominant. While this would protect and preserve capital, keep in mind of the savings gap shortfall in the years to come. For some, plans for retirement and children’s tuition fees could still be a decade away. However, the power of compounding interests matters in the long run. Therefore, households should periodically review their financial asset holdings to align it with respective financial goals even more so in this climate of global macro and market uncertainties. A defensive play could be a wise idea at the immediate term at least. While investment strategies are important and likely more relevant to the middle and high income households, for the majority of Malaysians especially the bottom 40% households, the fundamental issue remains the level of income. Although bottom 40% household median real income growth is estimated to have expanded 14.9% per annum between 2012 and 2014, growing at a much faster pace than the 5.9% per annum expansion among the top 20% households, ultimately, standard of living depends on the level of income per se. According to the Department of Statistics’ Salaries and Wages Survey Report 2015, the national median monthly salary is RM1,600. From the Household Income survey 2014, the median monthly household income of the bottom 40% household was RM2,629, compared to the income of RM11,610 of the top 20% household. With an average household size of 4.3 person per household, after deducting household expenses of food, fuel, medical fees, education costs, it begs to ponder if there are any substantial left over savings for an average household to save and invest for the lower income group? The situation looks equally worrying from the Employees Provident Fund’s (EPF) perspective. In October, EPF raised the savings threshold to ‘have a good life’ upon retirement to RM228,000, up from RM196,800 previously as Malaysia becomes an ageing population as soon as 2030. Unfortunately, EPF guided that some 78% of employees aged 54 and above have EPF savings well below the threshold. In fact in 2014, active EPF members between the 51 and 55 age group had on average RM159,952 in savings each. In light of low saving thresholds as well as early withdrawals by EPF members, a new scheme introduced as a second retirement savings account, Akaun Emas will be effective in January 2017. The EPF contributions for employees working after the age of 55 will be automatically deposited in the special account and the monies only allowed to be withdrawn when they reach age 60. While this initiative is a constructive measure to enforce a savings fund for employees’ retirement after 60, would it be adequate for comfortable retirement given estimated remaining life expectancy of 18.5 years for men and 20.9 years for women at 60 years of age? >Income growth and investment returns – left wanting for more Therefore, from a policy making point of view, there is a need for a two pronged approach for the wellbeing of our households in the long run – opportunities to boost income growth and avenues for investment returns. Nevertheless, expectations much be managed well as the burden should not directly fall on the shoulders of the fiscal policy. Government should be an enabler and leave the mechanics to the free and fair market. For investment platforms, there are already existing platforms such as Amanah Saham National and also the much encouraged Private Retirement Scheme for Malaysians to partake in the risks and returns opportunities from the market. For now, consumer awareness on regulated financial investment products could be promoted to encourage wider adoption of financial planning for the future. Looking ahead, market and macro volatility could very well remain heightened going into 2017. Cutting through the noise and chatter, the performance of gold price remains elevated since the beginning of the year, which have risen 15.5% until mid-November – after a two year annual decline since the last peak in early October 2012 – is a strong indication of safe haven shelter sentiments. Have gold price peaked, or would it continue to make gains? The market will tell in time. A resilient domestic demand supported by a rebound in international trade activities, pro-growth economic policies from the major economies such as US and UK and economic stability in China would be a very optimistic outlook to anticipate in 2017. Until then, households should continue to stay defensive, be prudent with expenditures and ready to seize opportunities in the market.

Wayne Munroe  told Tribune Business: “If I were a web shop owner, that would make me upset and, as a group, they could probably look at establishing a credit union and then insist that if you want to do business, you do business with the credit union. “If it worked in conjunction, or was side by side with their premises, it would have a very strong presence in the Family Islands and could, in fact, potentially put the banks out of business [there]. The banks bank with everyone other than the web shop owners.”     Mr Munroe has suggested in the past that Bahamian web shop operators could sue Canadian-owned commercial banks for discrimination over their refusal to accept deposits from the sector. The banks, though, argue that their worldwide policies prevent them from accepting gaming-related deposits, especially the online variety. CIBC FirstCaribbean, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) and Scotiabank are all adopting this stance, with an RBC (Bahamas) position paper warning that conducting business with web shops would run afoul of its parent bank’s global policies and US federal law. Two Bahamian-owned institutions, Commonwealth Bank and Fidelity Bank (Bahamas), are also refusing to deal with the web shop gaming industry, viewing it as too ‘high risk’. Such fears will have been heightened in an environment where Bahamian institutions, and their counterparts in the Caribbean, are struggling to maintain correspondent relations with developed country banks due to risk-related concerns. Accepting web shop deposits could be just the excuse a correspondent needs to terminate business. Bank of the Bahamas is the only institution to state publicly that it is doing business with web shops, having received clearance from its own US correspondent bank, JP Morgan Chase, to accept deposits from the newly-legalised sector.     “A license they could very readily get is a co-operative credit union license because they have a large number of staff across all of them, and participants,” Mr Munroe added of the web shops. “If I were them it would upset me how the banks discriminate against me, and my mission would be to put as many of them out of business through an alternative financial institution; that’s one option.” Setting up their own commercial bank is one option that has been mulled by the web shop industry, especially given the large financial sums it recycles. FML Group of Companies chief, Craig Flowers, has previously gone public with such a suggestion, and has long had a personal interest in banking, at one point eyeying whether to buy a Turks & Caicos bank that was in liquidation. However, one obstacle to web shop banking ambitions may be obtaining the necessary licences from the Central Bank of the Bahamas. And they may face the same difficulties going the credit union route, as the regulator is the same. However, Mr Munroe argued:“If I am given a license to do something and then the banks refuse to accept my money and I have to get money in the system, you basically force me to launder money. “We have a  legalised, regulated gaming industry, yet the banks say that they will accept deposits from web shop employees, which are generated in a web shop, and deposits from third party vendors. But all except the Bank of the Bahamas say that they will not hold established accounts for the web shop operators and that makes no sense whatsoever, especially since they bank with casinos.”     Mr Munroe acknowledged that the banks do not do online gaming banking for the casinos. “There is a good reason for that, which is - unlike the web shops who have to see their customers who do business in Bahamian dollars, which isn’t convertible currency - the casinos set up accounts online and do business in convertible currency,” he explained. “If you say it’s too much of a risk to do business with web shop owners, it makes no sense  because  before they got a license they had to disclose the past 20 years of their financial affairs. It’s very easy to establish with the Gaming Board what they say their existing circumstances are.” Web shops are already competing with the banks, given that they have in the past offered loans. They are also in the money transmission business, with clients able to pick up money from their account on any Bahamian island. One of the Government’s principal aims in legalising, regulating and taxing the web shops was to pull the industry into the formal economy and commercial banking system, thereby eliminating any regulatory risk to the Bahamas’ reputation.

These numbers criminals were only just made legitimate by way of a corrupt government. The whole entire world knows this. ALL of their stashed money is from proceeds of crime. Their now legit businesses were built from proceeds of crime. This money and the 10's of thousands of pieces of property they bought with this money should have been confiscated by government long ago. These guys are criminals and should be treated as such.

Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends in early 2018, reiterated the Fed’s political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress’ Joint Economic Committee. Economic data since Fed policymakers gathered in early November reinforced her view that the economy is making progress toward the Fed’s goals on employment and inflation. She said that at the meeting, she and her colleagues believed that the case for a rate increase “had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon.” Analysts viewed Yellen’s comments as an effort to put financial markets on notice that a rate hike is likely to occur at the Fed’s last meeting of the year on Dec. 13-14. They noted that she dismissed a suggestion that increased market uncertainty after Trump’s election might be cause for a delay. Asked whether it might be better to push back a move until January, Yellen said that uncertainty surrounding Trump’s proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending could well last for a good deal longer than one month. “Yellen’s testimony before Congress ... further cemented in place expectations that the Fed will hike rates next month,” said Michael Feroli, senior economist at JPMorgan. Asked about her own future, Yellen said it was “fully my intention” to remain as Fed chair until her four-year term ends on Feb. 3, 2018. She said she could not imagine any circumstance that would cause her to leave early, addressing speculation that she might step down once Trump takes office, given his critical comments of her during the election campaign. The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 and projected that it could raise rates as many as four times in 2016. But it deferred as the U.S. economy went through a prolonged soft-patch. The rate has remained in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent for the entire year. The rate had been at a record low near zero for seven years. Economists are forecasting that the Fed will raise rates by a quarter-point in December and then will boost rates two more times in 2017. Yellen stressed in her testimony that the slow recovery and absence of inflation pressures should allow the Fed to move gradually in raising its key rate, the federal funds rate. “Gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years,” Yellen said, referring to the point where the funds rate is neither promoting economic growth nor slowing growth. As measured by the gross domestic product, the economy grew at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, the government has estimated, more than twice the rate in the April-June quarter. The unemployment rate is 4.9 percent, around the level typical of a healthy economy, down from 10 percent in 2009. In addition to firmly stating that she has no plans of leaving the Fed before her term as chair is complete, Yellen also made clear that her views on bank regulation differ from Trump’s. Yellen gave a strong defense of the Dodd-Frank Act, passed by Congress in 2010 to increase financial market regulations in an effort to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. After the country lived through a “devastating financial crisis,” Yellen said that “I would not want to see the clock turned back on all the improvements we have made.” Trump and other Republicans have attacked Yellen and other federal bank regulators for imposing too-restrictive rules on banks, pledging that they will seek to repeal major parts of the 2010 law. ——— This story has been corrected to show that Yellen’s term ends Feb. 3, 2018, not January 2018.     Tags: yellen, rates, percent, economy, financial, trump, Other stories from today: Facebook buys Pittsburgh-based facial analysis software firm Wells Fargo sees significant slowdown in account openings Google hits Pixel resellers with ’digital death sentence’     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   If you are traveling for Thanksgiving, when is the best time to go?

Updated List Of Everything We Know So Far By Julia Glum @superjulia On 11/18/16 AT 9:56 AM Close One of the first orders of business for any newly chosen American president is to figure out his or her cabinet, the group of high-level officials who direct policy in major areas of the government. Much like the run-up to the election, President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet selection has been widely covered and dominated by rumors.  Nearly every famous Republican's name has come up in connection with a cabinet position in the past week. To help you keep it all straight, here's a list of what we know for sure about the Trump White House.  This story will be continually updated as news of the cabinet nominees breaks.  Chief of Staff: Officially chosen. The appointment of Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus was confirmed by Trump's transition team Sunday. National Security Adviser: Officially chosen. Retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn has been offered the post, the Trump transition team confirmed Friday. Secretary of State: Not chosen. Candidates include former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former ambassador John Bolton and Tennessee Sen.

Tom Cotton, former National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley and New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, Politico reported. Attorney General: Officially chosen. Alabama Sen.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Nov 18, 2016 at 9:29AM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. If you're thinking about buying bank stocks, or any kind of stocks for that matter, few things are more important than profitability. To make things easy, here's a list of the 10 most profitable big banks in America. Name Net Income (TTM*) (Millions) Return on Assets (TTM) Return on Equity (TTM) U.S. Bancorp $5,886 1.36% 14.26% Wells Fargo $22,239 1.21% 12.78% Fifth Third Bancorp $1,832 1.29% 12.24% Northern Trust $999 0.84% 11.78% Commerce Bancshares $268 1.09% 11.61% State Street $2,126 0.85% 11.33% JPMorgan Chase $23,440 0.96% 10.47% Cullen/Frost Bankers $279 0.97% 9.70% Bank of New York Mellon $3,370 0.89% 9.40% Huntington Bancshares $651 0.84% 9.40% *TTM: trailing 12 months. Data source: YCharts.com. There are a few points to note here. First, these banks are all members of the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen of the nation's biggest banks, ranging from Commerce Bancshares, which has $25 billion in assets on its balance sheet, up to JPMorgan Chase, which has a $2.5 trillion balance sheet. Second, at least in the context of investing, profitability doesn't just mean how much a bank earns. If that were the case, then the biggest banks on any list would almost invariably also be the most profitable. Given this, it's important to look beyond a bank's earnings to determine how profitable it is on a relative basis. That's why the above list isn't sorted by net income, but instead by return on equity. This places U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) at the top despite the fact that they're aren't the three biggest banks on the KBW Bank Index. Return on equity is calculated by dividing a bank's net income by its shareholders' equity. In this way, it shows how much profit a bank earns from every dollars' worth of equity. In U.S. Bancorp's case, it's earned $0.14 from every dollar in equity over the last 12 months. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo has earned $0.13 from each dollar and Fifth Third Bancorp is at $0.12 per equity dollar. This makes it easy to determine how effective, say, U.S. Bancorp's management is relative to Wells Fargo's, even though Wells Fargo is roughly four times larger than U.S. Bancorp. And the same is true for Fifth Third Bancorp, which is less than a tenth of Wells Fargo's size. The final metric that's worth considering when you're assessing a bank's profitability is return on assets. Because banks are so heavily leveraged, typically by a factor of 10 to 1, it can be hard to tease out whether one bank earns more than another simply because it uses more leverage. The way to tell whether this is the case is to look at return on assets, which is calculated by dividing a bank's earnings by its total assets, as opposed to its shareholders' equity. It may go without saying, as you can see in the table, but there's bound to be overlap between these two profitability figures. In this case, regardless of whether we look at return on equity or return on assets, U.S. Bancorp, Wells Fargo, and Fifth Third Bancorp remain at the top of the list. The only difference is that, excluding leverage, Fifth Third outperforms Wells Fargo. The lesson here for investors is twofold. First, profitability should be a primary consideration when picking bank stocks. And second, that profitability is about more than just profits and is dependent, in no small part, on how you measure it. John Maxfield owns shares of US Bancorp and Wells Fargo.

By adding its voice this week to the long list of institutions pressing Germany to spend more, the European Commission left Berlin looking more isolated and out-of-step than at any time since the outbreak of the global financial crisis nearly a decade ago. Predictably, the Commission's call for a "significantly more positive fiscal stance" in the euro area was shot down by Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble and the conservative media establishment in Germany. On Friday, Schaeuble accused the Commission of overstepping its mandate and urged it to focus its energies on enforcing the EU's fiscal rules. But by this time next year, the episode may be looked back upon as the first step towards a broader change in Europe's economic approach, away from the austerity-first stance pushed successfully by Berlin for many years. This could be fuelled by a range of factors: the pressures arising from Donald Trump's victory in the U.S. election and the arrival of new governments in France and Germany in 2017. "We expect that the German position will gradually lose influence," Marco Protopapa of JPMorgan said this week. Trump's win is especially significant. On the one hand, it is likely to increase pressure on Germany to spend more public money on defence and security. On the other, it sends a powerful signal to the German political establishment about the dangers of ignoring an increasingly frustrated underclass, buffeted by the forces of globalisation, that has shown a readiness to vent its anger at the ballot box. GRAND BARGAIN The looming French election will be crucial. Centre-right frontrunner Alain Juppe, and his top conservative rivals Francois Fillon and Nicolas Sarkozy, are all promising radical economic reform if they are elected in May of next year. That could open the door to the sort of "grand bargain", or reforms-for-stimulus compromise between France and Germany, that has been talked about for years but was impossible with a weak, unpopular Francois Hollande in the Elysee and the French economy languishing. "We are very much in the grand bargain game," an adviser to Juppe told Reuters. The real game changer could be the German election in the autumn of next year and the fate of Schaeuble, the personification of Germany's rule-based restrictive approach to fiscal policy. The most likely outcome of that vote looks like another "grand coalition" between Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). Schaeuble, 74, has already said that he plans to run for a seat in the Bundestag again, a signal to many that he would like to continue to play an important role in the next cabinet. But the SPD, which would probably have first choice of ministries in such a constellation, could claim the finance ministry this time around, as they did in 2005 in Merkel's first term. That would push Schaeuble into another ministry, blunting his role as a guardian of fiscal rectitude. One senior official who served in both grand coalitions said the lessons of the past years would push Merkel's next coalition partner to take the finance ministry instead of the foreign ministry, the traditional first choice. "Regardless of who that partner is, everyone has understood that the finance ministry has a great deal more value than the foreign ministry," the official said. FROM WITHIN Christian Odendahl, chief economist at the Centre for European Reform, said the European Commission's call for more spending was unlikely to sway Germany. "The change needs to come from within," he said. But Odendahl does believe that a more vigorous debate is developing within Germany over the wisdom of Schaeuble's "Schwarze Null", or balanced budget, policies. A poll for public broadcaster ARD in September showed that 58 percent of Germans favoured spending additional tax revenues on infrastructure investments, compared with 22 percent who prefer debt reduction and 16 percent who want tax cuts. "If you had a different finance minister or if the political case for a topic-based fiscal expansion grew, then you could see a shift," he said, citing the messages from Trump's election. "Merkel is far too pragmatic and political to make the Schwarze Null a priority when there are other problems to address." A more expansive German fiscal policy after the election may help pave the way for a tightening of monetary policy, a step Schaeuble himself has called for. The European Central Bank (ECB), which meets next month to decide on whether to extend its quantitative easing (QE), or bond-buying programme, has been looking for ways out of its ultra-loose stance. It too has called on Germany to grab the stimulus baton. Marcel Fratzscher, who runs the Berlin-based DIW economic institute and is a former senior official at the ECB, says the pressure is building on Berlin to shift its stance. His worry is that the ruling parties may end up wasting the fiscal wiggle room they have by making lavish promises to pensioners in the coming election campaign. "I think there will be a further shift, even if Schaeuble stays. If the United States ratchets up spending and this is successful then it would be a signal," he said. "My worry is that it could come too late, that the government will have used its fiscal space for pension increases and tax reductions."

Congressman with Ties to Trump to play key role on bank rules His staff is known for saying he’s no friend of mega-banks Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mail With some in the finance industry salivating over the prospect of deregulation under Donald Trump, a key power broker is emerging who might bring headaches for Wall Street. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling has already been rumored as a potential Treasury Secretary under Trump and he’s got a plan at his fingertips for ripping up and replacing the Dodd-Frank Act. The Texas congressman -- who met with the president-elect at Trump Tower Thursday -- has said he’s been in constant discussion with Trump’s transition team about his proposed legislation, which many lobbyists expect to be the starting point for rewriting bank rules in a Republican-controlled government. Hensarling at Trump Tower on Nov. 17. Photographer: Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/AFP/Getty Images What Trump Might Mean for Wall Street Reform Law: Quicktake Q&A There are a lot of things Wall Street likes in Hensarling’s bill. It scraps the Volcker Rule ban on lenders making speculative market bets with their own capital. It reins in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has boosted oversight of everything from mortgage lending to credit cards. It eliminates a Dodd-Frank provision that set limits on how much banks can charge retailers when merchants accept debit cards. Asset managers and insurers in particular like his plans to overhaul the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a collection of regulators with authority to impose punitive rules on companies by labeling them systemically important financial institutions. But passing Hensarling’s bill wouldn’t necessarily free large banks from the handcuffs Washington put on them after the financial crisis, unless lenders want to take the unappealing step of raising hundreds of billions of dollars in new capital. The Republican also has a strong populist streak, has been perceived by Wall Street as unyielding on policy positions and almost always colors his criticism of Dodd-Frank as a failed attempt to do away with too-big-to-fail banks. That mirrors the message that Trump himself championed during his campaign when he called for breaking up the biggest banks and reining in Wall Street’s influence in politics. Such views can’t bring comfort to the likes of JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. “Wall Street has long believed Hensarling is their obstacle to getting reasonable compromise,” said Mark Calabria, a financial regulation expert at the Cato Institute think tank. “There’s a perception that he’s an ideologue who won’t compromise. When bankers go into meet with him, they feel like they are getting a lecture.” After meeting with Trump Thursday, Hensarling told reporters in New York that he is very excited to help the incoming president “drain the swamp” in Washington and get the economy “working for Americans again.” While Hensarling has a great position leading the financial services panel, he said he would certainly consider a different role if Trump asks. Guiding Policy Lobbyists and their clients rely on the fact that when a bill is introduced, they will get ample opportunity to promote the aspects of it they like and attack the elements they don’t. But bankers can’t assume they will have an open dialogue with Hensarling or that he’s even that interested in hearing from them at all. For instance, before unveiling the full text of his bill to replace Dodd-Frank in June, his office summoned more than two dozen lobbyists to a private gathering on Capitol Hill to lay out some rules of engagement, according to attendees. Hensarling’s staff scheduled the meeting after lobbyists complained they weren’t being consulted on legislation that would have huge implications for financial firms. Hensarling quickly got to the point: He indicated he didn’t care whether the industry supported everything in his bill, because he was going to introduce it regardless. The lawmaker then left to catch a plane. Hensarling’s staff took over the discussion, explaining that they only planned to meet with trade groups to get feedback, rather than engaging with representatives from individual firms. Specific companies were told, though, that they could send letters on the legislation to Hensarling’s office, said the attendees who asked not to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly. A spokeswoman for Hensarling declined to comment on the meeting. Frosty Relationship The gathering served as a stark reminder of the frosty relationship Hensarling sometimes has with New York mega-banks, some of the attendees said. His staff often boasts he’s not a friend of Wall Street and doesn’t seek their buy-in on policy, people familiar with the comments say. But after Trump’s surprise win and Republicans keeping control of Congress, banks know Hensarling will play a key role in determining whether the industry accomplishes its top goals on Capitol Hill. That’s true whether he joins the new president’s cabinet or continues to lead the main House panel that deals with oversight of banks and their regulators. Hensarling said this week that his staff is working to update his bill. Legislation on financial rules will likely be handled in the Senate by Mike Crapo, who’s expected to be the new chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. Crapo, an Idaho Republican, has previously supported a variety of measures to alter Dodd-Frank. The House Financial Services Committee is “interested in working on a 2.0 version,” Hensarling said of his bill Wednesday at the Exchequer Club in Washington. “Advice and counsel is welcome.” Hensarling has more connections than most lawmakers to the Washington-neophyte Trump. He’s a close confidant of Vice President-elect Mike Pence, even appearing with him on campaign stops over the past few months. A longtime staffer on Hensarling’s committee is helping to shape financial services policy for the Trump transition team. Other aides to Hensarling are working with or connected to Trump’s inner circle, including the lawmaker’s staff director, who is married to Trump’s top lawyer. Dismantling Dodd-Frank While Trump’s transition team put out a statement last week pledging to dismantle Dodd-Frank, it hasn’t laid out a plan on what it would do instead. That leaves a void that Hensarling’s Financial Choice Act could fill. Still, few lobbyists anticipate a total repeal of Dodd-Frank, which banks have spent years and millions of dollars complying with. Because of filibuster rules, Congress probably can’t pass legislation without the votes of at least some Democrats in the Senate. That means changes will be easier to negotiate than a total overhaul. During his Wednesday speech, Hensarling acknowledged the hurdles posed by Senate procedures and said he’s prepared to work with Democrats on a compromise. A key plank of his Choice Act is that it frees banks from a litany of rules if they boost their leverage ratios -- a figure meant to show how safe a lender is by measuring the amount of equity capital it has in relation to total assets. In theory, the higher the ratio, the bigger the buffer for losses before a bank goes bust. Raising Billions Hensarling’s bill demands that banks have a leverage ratio of at least 10 percent to qualify for regulatory relief. For comparison, Citigroup’s leverage ratio was 7.4 percent at the end of the third quarter. When Hensarling first released details on his legislation in June, he predicted the biggest Wall Street firms combined could have to raise “several hundred billion dollars in new equity” if they wanted to be exempt from regulations. For a big bank that declines Hensarling’s offer, they’d probably be stuck with a whole slew of burdensome requirements, including post-crisis regulations on capital and liquidity, and annual stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve meant to determine whether lenders can weather a severe economic downturn. “It’s a slippery slope,” said Cato’s Calabria, who previously worked as a Republican staff member on the Senate Banking Committee. Once lenders make the decision to opt out of rules, they’ve “legitimized the argument that banks should have higher capital requirements,” he said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The reason for the clandestine preparations: the Eurobond was a crucial step for Russia's limping economy and Moscow feared its Western adversaries might try to sabotage it by pressuring foreign financial institutions to steer clear. "I had not experienced such secrecy in my life before," said Andrey Solovyov, head of debt capital markets at the state-run investment bank, VTB Capital, and one of the three people in the know. Western governments led by Washington have imposed sanctions on certain Russian individuals and entities, over Moscow's annexation of Crimea and its role in the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, aiming to hinder access to Western financing. The sanctions do not, however, forbid Western firms from taking part in a Russian Eurobond - an international bond denominated in a foreign currency. Reuters interviews with about a dozen government officials, bankers and investors involved in the deal shows the lengths that Russia was willing to go to secure Western finance. The May 23 launch was shrouded in secrecy, even from managers who were going to handle it. And it came close to collapsing in the fraught hours that followed. Russian Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said the U.S. administration "found a way to pressure its financial institutions" to eschew the placement. And at the eleventh hour, in a highly unorthodox move, officials had to turn to a local intermediary to handle the technicalities of the issue after two European clearing houses declined to handle it – one of them hours into the launch day, according to two banking sources familiar with the placement. In the end, Russia placed the Eurobond in the market and raised $1.75 billion, as targeted.      Views differ about whether this was a triumph. Moscow said it showed it could still access Western credit markets, despite U.S. resistance. Buyers included at least one big U.S. asset manager which declined to be named due to the political sensitivity of the matter. But some Western financial industry insiders said the issue was a hollow victory, because some of the biggest financial institutions - including the likes of BNP Paribas and JPMorgan - kept away from the primary issue, and they have the capital Russia needs in the long term. CLEARING CONUNDRUM The fact Russia was planning a Eurobond was not a secret. This had been announced by Moscow in February and, according to multiple sources in Russian and Western financial institutions, around that time the Obama administration had advised Western players not to participate. A U.S. Treasury spokesman told Reuters it had not barred U.S. entities from taking part, but "highlighted potential risks that could arise if sanctioned entities were indirectly involved in the issuance". He did not elaborate, but lawyers said the main risk was that investors' money might end up going to sanctioned entities, which could theoretically breach the sanctions. Russian officials and bankers say they acted specifically to catch U.S. officials off-guard. From about two months before the launch, they did not tell VTB Capital managers or workers - apart from the select three - about the details of the issue, such as the date and the terms offered. Once the day of the launch came, it was a rollercoaster. The bond was launched in the morning Moscow time, so VTB could talk to would-be clients in Europe and Asia at least for a few hours to assure them there was no sanctions risk before they received countervailing calls from the U.S. Treasury, the sources said. The terms were attractive; the yield was 4.75 percent - a significant premium on the ultra-low yields on offer in European markets, and on existing Russian sovereign bonds. On May 23, a Monday, the order was given to VTB Capital bankers to start pitching to clients. Would-be investors put in their bids. Business was brisk. The expectation among the organisers, and on the market, was that the order book would be closed quickly. Yet by lunchtime, the first glitch occurred: the order book was still open. The problem, according to two banking sources familiar with the discussions around the placement, was with the clearing houses crucial to placing such a bond. The two big houses, Euroclear and Clearstream, act as intermediaries, taking money from investors and holding the securities on their behalf. Rules at most big banks prevent them taking part in a Eurobond if one of the two is not on board. Before the bond launch, Clearstream had declined to get involved in the deal, according to a government source who said this was the result of political reasons, without elaborating on this. Clearstream declined to comment. That left Euroclear. The two banking sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity about private discussions, said that shortly before VTB Capital opened the order book for its issue, it reached a loose agreement with Euroclear that it would act as clearing agent. Yet by midday in Moscow on May 23, Euroclear had still not given a formal, definite answer on whether it would clear the issue or not, according to one of the bankers. Launching without one of the two houses on board was a highly unusual if not unprecedented move for a country issuing a Eurobond, an indication of Russia's determination to place the bond. The two banking sources said Euroclear held back because it was worried about the risks stemming from the U.S. government's attitude to the bond. Euroclear declined to comment. MAKE-OR-BREAK By the end of Monday, with the bond still not placed - and no international clearing house to handle the issue - investors were getting anxious. "Rumours started to spread that 'the goods are sub-standard, rotten, that you should make a run for it'," said the first banking source. "Investors started to gradually take back their orders." The next morning, VTB staff were fighting a rearguard action, trying to persuade customers not to withdraw orders. Senior executives at the bank kept pressing Euroclear to say if it would take part or not, the source said. VTB Chief Executive Andrei Kostin personally called Euroclear executives, said the first banking source. Asked about this, VTB said that as sole arranger, "the bank was in contact with all parties involved in this process". The issue had reached a make-or-break point by late on Tuesday. "At the end of the second day, we took the decision that we're going ahead without Euroclear," said Solovyov, the VTB Capital head of debt capital markets. It is unclear if Euroclear ever came back with an answer - but Moscow anyway had a plan B. A month earlier, the finance ministry had got in touch with the National Settlement Depository (NSD), Russia's domestic clearing house, asking it to handle the Eurobond in case Euroclear did not take part, said NSD head Eddie Astanin. "It was unexpected," Astanin said of that request to the depository, which had never handled a Eurobond. He had assigned his team to draw up a plan, which was ultimately put into action. HITTING THE PHONES It was now evening on day two in Moscow. VTB bankers knew they were still on thin ice regarding potential clients. While the terms offered better returns than outstanding Russian Eurobonds, the bond would not be "euroclearable" - so buyers would need to take a leap of faith, handing over their money to a Russian settlement system that was untried. Bankers hit the phones at VTB Capital, where patriotic anthem "Rise up, vast country" was played in the VIP elevator after sanctions were imposed in 2014. Unusually, the bank's senior management also picked up the phones to clients to offer "all sorts of assurances", said the first banking source. Some investors could not be persuaded. "We were honest and gave them feedback that because of the spirit of the sanctions we would not be taking part," said Bryan Carter, head of emerging markets fixed income at BNP Paribas Investment Partners. One London-based hedge fund manager, who declined to be identified, said his fund wanted to buy but missed the deadline because the fund's compliance department, worried by U.S. warnings, took a long time to give the green light. For those who did buy, there were arguments in favour. Pavel Mamai, portfolio manager at UK hedge fund Promeritum Investment Management, for example believed U.S. investors who did not take part in the initial issue would want to buy the bond later, allowing him to sell at a profit. "I wasn't sure it would become euroclearable but I still thought it would have upside as it came so cheap," he said. Mamai did later resell the bond, twice, and made money each time, he said. The order book was closed soon after 8 p.m. Moscow time, 6 p.m. in London, with the primary issue raising $1.75 billion. The finance ministry said around 75 percent of it was bought by foreign investors, though Reuters cannot independently verify that. The next morning, the bond started selling on the secondary market. Over the following days, Western investment banks included the bond in their indices, making it easier to trade. On July 28, Euroclear started clearing the bond - meaning every investor in the world could buy it.

REUTERS/Maxim Zmeyev/File Photo By Lidia Kelly, Katya Golubkova and Sujata Rao | MOSCOW/LONDON MOSCOW/LONDON When Russia sought to raise money on Western debt markets this year with a Eurobond, only three people at the state-run investment bank organizing the issue were told in advance about the date and details of the launch. The reason for the clandestine preparations: the Eurobond was a crucial step for Russia's limping economy and Moscow feared its Western adversaries might try to sabotage it by pressuring foreign financial institutions to steer clear. "I had not experienced such secrecy in my life before," said Andrey Solovyov, head of debt capital markets at the state-run investment bank, VTB Capital, and one of the three people in the know. Western governments led by Washington have imposed sanctions on certain Russian individuals and entities, over Moscow's annexation of Crimea and its role in the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine, aiming to hinder access to Western financing. The sanctions do not, however, forbid Western firms from taking part in a Russian Eurobond - an international bond denominated in a foreign currency. Reuters interviews with about a dozen government officials, bankers and investors involved in the deal shows the lengths that Russia was willing to go to secure Western finance. The May 23 launch was shrouded in secrecy, even from managers who were going to handle it. And it came close to collapsing in the fraught hours that followed. Russian Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak said the U.S. administration "found a way to pressure its financial institutions" to eschew the placement. And at the eleventh hour, in a highly unorthodox move, officials had to turn to a local intermediary to handle the technicalities of the issue after two European clearing houses declined to handle it – one of them hours into the launch day, according to two banking sources familiar with the placement. In the end, Russia placed the Eurobond in the market and raised $1.75 billion, as targeted.  Views differ about whether this was a triumph. Moscow said it showed it could still access Western credit markets, despite U.S. resistance. Buyers included at least one big U.S. asset manager which declined to be named due to the political sensitivity of the matter. But some Western financial industry insiders said the issue was a hollow victory, because some of the biggest financial institutions - including the likes of BNP Paribas and JPMorgan - kept away from the primary issue, and they have the capital Russia needs in the long term. CLEARING CONUNDRUM The fact Russia was planning a Eurobond was not a secret. This had been announced by Moscow in February and, according to multiple sources in Russian and Western financial institutions, around that time the Obama administration had advised Western players not to participate. A U.S. Treasury spokesman told Reuters it had not barred U.S. entities from taking part, but "highlighted potential risks that could arise if sanctioned entities were indirectly involved in the issuance". He did not elaborate, but lawyers said the main risk was that investors' money might end up going to sanctioned entities, which could theoretically breach the sanctions. Russian officials and bankers say they acted specifically to catch U.S. officials off-guard. From about two months before the launch, they did not tell VTB Capital managers or workers - apart from the select three - about the details of the issue, such as the date and the terms offered. Once the day of the launch came, it was a rollercoaster. The bond was launched in the morning Moscow time, so VTB could talk to would-be clients in Europe and Asia at least for a few hours to assure them there was no sanctions risk before they received countervailing calls from the U.S. Treasury, the sources said.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) In this Nov. 16 file photo, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani walks from an elevator as he leaves Trump Tower in New York. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) By ERIC LIPTON and RUSS BUETTNER / The New York Times Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF WASHINGTON – It was a golden year for Rudolph W. Giuliani, a mad dash that would take him to 11 countries on four continents, and by the time 2006 was done, earn him $16 million — a princely sum compared with the $7,000 he claimed to have in 2001, when he went through a divorce. With salaries from a law firm and a consulting firm, and most of all $10 million from 108 speeches he delivered to audiences around the world, the lucrative year of 2006 will now, along with the rest of Giuliani’s career after his tenure as New York’s mayor, be getting a new round of scrutiny if he is nominated as secretary of state by President-elect Donald Trump. The blitz of activity by Giuliani in 2006 – speaking to Wall Street banks; oil, gold mining and pharmaceutical companies; and investor groups in Japan and Singapore — is public because the next year he began a campaign for president and had to file a financial disclosure form. But that public ledger offers the most detailed look at just how Giuliani managed to become so wealthy after he left office, with assets worth tens of millions of dollars, including homes he now owns in Palm Beach, Fla., the Hamptons and New York City. Giuliani’s speeches and travel that year and in the decade since were often related to business deals he was pursuing, or even standing agreements he had reached, like the one with backers of the dissident Iranian political party known as the Mujahedeen Khalq, which until 2012 was considered a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department. They offer a road map of sorts to the kinds of potential conflict of interest questions that are already emerging as Giuliani’s name is floated as a possible Trump Cabinet member, particularly given that Trump repeatedly mocked Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, for the many paid speeches she and her husband gave after they left public office. In particular, Trump criticized Clinton’s speeches to Wall Street banks. But Giuliani, in a one-year year period that ended in January 2007, earned $750,000 in speaking fees — before the 20 percent cut taken by the speakers’ agency — for eight speeches he gave to Wall Street banks and other major financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Bros., before its collapse. As with Clinton, there is little public record of what Giuliani said during these events. Some members of the Senate, which will hold hearings and vote on his nomination if Trump selects him, are already saying they want to learn more about Giuliani’s work in the years since he left City Hall. “I’m concerned generally about conflicts of interest on the part of prospective members of the administration, in every role,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said when asked about Giuliani’s business ventures since he left office. “And that concern is well justified in terms of the backgrounds of some of the potential nominees that have been discussed.” Giuliani, in an interview this week, defended his activities since he left office, saying he had been open about his dealings with private companies and foreign states or political parties, including the Iranian group. “My ties to them are completely open,” Giuliani said. Giuliani certainly kept up a feverish pace. In one month alone during 2006, he gave 20 speeches. From 2001 to 2008, the year he ran for president, he was on the road as much as 200 days a year, according to Anthony V. Carbonetti, a former New York City Hall aide. “Every time I turned, he was calling me from a different country or a different city,” Carbonetti said. For most of those trips, he had a standard speech that mixed a retelling of leadership lessons outlined in his book and memories from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which ultimately earned him the nickname “America’s mayor.” “I heard it so many times, I could have given the speech,” Carbonetti joked. The speeches that have drawn the greatest scrutiny are those he gave from 2012 through last year at events organized by the Mujahedeen Khalq, a dissident group of Iranians that holds a rally in France every year to draw attention to the persecution of its members by the government of Iran. Giuliani was paid for “three or four” speeches he delivered to the group, said Robert G. Torricelli, a former senator from New Jersey who served as a lawyer for the MEK, as the group is known, as it sought to be removed from a State Department list of terrorist organizations. Paul S. Ryan, a vice president for policy and litigation at Common Cause, a nonprofit group that examines special interest influence in politics, said there would be no legal prohibition on Giuliani moving from being paid by the group to a government job. But he still found it troubling. “People would reasonably question his fitness for this political appointment given that he received payments from supporters of this organization, and these are matters he would be charged with dealing with as secretary of state,” he said. Torricelli said that Giuliani had agreed to give the paid speeches because he supported the group’s message, and that he had volunteered his time to participate in negotiations in Europe to help prevent further attacks on refugees from the group who were then living in Iraq. Giuliani’s work earned him a spot on several lists of the highest-paid speakers in the world, just one spot below Bill Clinton, in one ranking. In the afterglow of his post-9/11 fame, Giuliani could certainly ignite large rooms. Giuliani spoke at dozens of events with Zig Ziglar, a motivational speaker. Ziglar’s daughter, Julie Ziglar Norman, who traveled with her father in those years, said Giuliani was a crowd favorite, along with her father and Colin L. Powell. “I know everybody always loved what he had to say,” Ziglar Norman said. “It was always very pro-American. And he was just beloved. That’s the best way I can describe him.” Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off Most Popular USC bowls over UCLA, 36-14 Suspect shot by Anaheim police officer Miller: Another dose of reality for Mora, UCLA Election 2016: A tale of three cities reflects national contrasts Firefighters battle blaze in Anaheim User Agreement Comments are encouraged, but you must follow our Privacy Policy Policy & Terms of Use Keep it civil and stay on topic.

Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends in early 2018, reiterated the Fed's political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress' Joint Economic Committee. Economic data since Fed policymakers gathered in early November reinforced her view that the economy is making progress toward the Fed's goals on employment and inflation. She said that at the meeting, she and her colleagues believed that the case for a rate increase "had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon." Analysts viewed Yellen's comments as an effort to put financial markets on notice that a rate hike is likely to occur at the Fed's last meeting of the year on Dec. 13-14. They noted that she dismissed a suggestion that increased market uncertainty after Trump's election might be cause for a delay. Asked whether it might be better to push back a move until January, Yellen said that uncertainty surrounding Trump's proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending could well last for a good deal longer than one month. "Yellen's testimony before Congress ... further cemented in place expectations that the Fed will hike rates next month," said Michael Feroli, senior economist at JPMorgan. Asked about her own future, Yellen said it was "fully my intention" to remain as Fed chair until her four-year term ends on Feb. 3, 2018. She said she could not imagine any circumstance that would cause her to leave early, addressing speculation that she might step down once Trump takes office, given his critical comments of her during the election campaign. The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 and projected that it could raise rates as many as four times in 2016. But it deferred as the U.S. economy went through a prolonged soft-patch. The rate has remained in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent for the entire year. The rate had been at a record low near zero for seven years. Economists are forecasting that the Fed will raise rates by a quarter-point in December and then will boost rates two more times in 2017. Yellen stressed in her testimony that the slow recovery and absence of inflation pressures should allow the Fed to move gradually in raising its key rate, the federal funds rate. "Gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years," Yellen said, referring to the point where the funds rate is neither promoting economic growth nor slowing growth. As measured by the gross domestic product, the economy grew at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, the government has estimated, more than twice the rate in the April-June quarter. The unemployment rate is 4.9 percent, around the level typical of a healthy economy, down from 10 percent in 2009. In addition to firmly stating that she has no plans of leaving the Fed before her term as chair is complete, Yellen also made clear that her views on bank regulation differ from Trump's. Yellen gave a strong defense of the Dodd-Frank Act, passed by Congress in 2010 to increase financial market regulations in an effort to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. After the country lived through a "devastating financial crisis," Yellen said that "I would not want to see the clock turned back on all the improvements we have made." Trump and other Republicans have attacked Yellen and other federal bank regulators for imposing too-restrictive rules on banks, pledging that they will seek to repeal major parts of the 2010 law. ___ This story has been corrected to show that Yellen's term ends Feb. 3, 2018, not January 2018.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo 1/3 left right A banner promoting Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect is displayed at the Hong Kong Exchanges in Hong Kong August 16, 2016. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo 2/3 left right Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Chief Executive Charles Li speaks during a news conference introducing Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect, at the Hong Kong Exchanges in Hong Kong August 16, 2016. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo 3/3 A long-awaited stock trading link between Hong Kong and Shenzhen will go live in coming days, the CEO of Hong Kong's bourse said, further opening up China's capital markets to global investors and giving them access to some of its fastest growing companies. With more than 1,800 listed companies that have a combined market capitalization of $3.3 trillion, the Shenzhen stock market is viewed by analysts as offering tremendous investment potential. HSBC, in fact, calls it the "largest untapped investment opportunity in the world". But sky high valuations and wild swings in Chinese stock prices mean investment flows from Hong Kong into its northern neighbor could take time to materialize. On the other hand, as Chinese retail investors seek to diversify away from their home market and put their funds into assets in a stronger currency, Hong Kong may be a key beneficiary. "Certainly I don't think you will see significant interest in the northbound part of the connect until you have greater optimism about the outlook for domestic equities," Richard Titherington, head of the Asia Pacific Equities team at JPMorgan Asset Management, told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in Hong Kong. The launch of the so-called Shenzhen Connect scheme is expected "in a few more days," Charles Li, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (0388.HK), said on Friday. The move expands an existing trading link between Hong Kong and Shanghai, allowing foreign investors to trade stocks directly in Shenzhen, the world's second-busiest exchange, from Hong Kong. Speaking at the Shenzhen stock exchange in the first stop of a roadshow in mainland China to promote the trading link, Li urged Chinese investors to diversify their holdings with Hong Kong stocks and joked that with real estate prices in the city so expensive, shares may be a better bet. "China residents have a lot of wealth and they need to preserve the value and add value to it, so they have to diversify their investments," Li said. DELAYED START The Shenzhen Connect had been expected to start more than a year ago, but was put on hold after a slump in the Shenzhen and Shanghai bourses, with stocks diving more than 40 percent and the government implementing a series of measures to prop up markets. China approved the Shenzhen trading scheme in August. Among HSBC's top recommendations to investors on Shenzhen-listed companies are Wanda Cinema Line Co Ltd (002739.SZ), China's largest cinema operator, and Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology (002415.SZ), the world's second largest maker of video surveillance cameras, the bank said a report this month. For Chinese investors facing a weakening economy and currency, investing in mid-size Hong Kong-listed companies may be one way to offset the domestic downturn, investors said. Investment flows into Hong Kong shares since the trading link with Shanghai was unveiled two years ago are nearly double the volumes from Hong Kong into China and the Shenzhen link means "strong southbound inflows" will continue, HSBC said. "We do see pretty strong interest, at least from our client base, in investing in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong link," said Wang Ren, chief financial officer at China Minsheng Financial, the investment arm of China's largest private fund, at the Reuters summit. "In the initial few days definitely we will see a pickup in volume, but it depends on the currency situation. People want to allocate more money offshore," Wang said.

Photographer: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP via Getty Images Gone are threats of imminent exodus and economic calamity Finance executives say London’s status not under threat Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Global bank executives are softening their warnings that the U.K.’s looming withdrawal from the European Union will spur an imminent exodus of staff from London.  Bankers are gaining confidence that U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May will be able to secure a lengthy transition period that would carry them over from the current rules to whatever fresh terms of trade are agreed with the EU, according to two people with knowledge of their firm’s contingency plans. That’s led to more measured language from many of the industry’s leaders. “Wait and see is also UBS’s attitude toward Brexit," UBS Group AG Chairman Axel Weber said Wednesday at a conference in the U.K. capital. “No doubt London will remain an important financial center. UBS will be here.” The shift in tone, also evident from banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Barclays Plc, comes after May sought to quell fears in the finance industry that her government wouldn’t fight to protect it from the fallout of Brexit when negotiations begin early next year. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney also called this week for a long transition period to give banks a chance to adapt. “Nobody wants to make a bad decision by moving quickly with the amount of uncertainty around," Daniel Pinto, JPMorgan’s head of corporate and investment banking, said in an interview. “We will be ready to make a permanent decision once we have a better idea of the direction of travel.” ‘Gravitational Pull’ Banks continue to plan for the worst: the loss of their right to sell services freely around the EU from London after the end of the two-year Brexit negotiation period. And they are ready to start the process of moving people abroad within weeks of Britain triggering Article 50, scheduled for March, as May would still have to convince EU counterparts to agree to a transition period. But bankers have paused on issuing warnings of pandemonium and threats to relocate abroad that circulated in the months before and after June’s referendum. "I don’t think London will lose its gravitational pull in terms of the management of capital in any reasonable time-frame," Barclays Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley said at a conference this week. "I would not underestimate at all the ability of the U.K. to remain as creative as it’s been historically." Before the referendum, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he would relocate as many as 4,000 employees to the continent after Brexit. In September, UBS said that it may have to move 1,500 staff out of London after Brexit, or 30 percent of its U.K. workforce. That same month, one of JPMorgan’s top executives in Europe said there would be "pandemonium" unless there was an agreement for a transition period. Mending Fences Relations between the finance industry and May’s government reached a low point at the Conservative Party conference in early October when officials said banks would get no special favors in the Brexit negotiations and suggested their threats to leave London were empty. Since then, there has been a concerted effort within government to mend relations with the City, officials said earlier this month. That involved Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, who campaigned against Brexit, and pro-leave lawmakers such as David Davis setting aside their ideological differences in pursuit of a common strategy to quit the EU. Davis said recently he was "determined to get the best possible deal” for London-based banks. Recently, bankers have laced their warnings with some optimism. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc Chairman Howard Davies said Sunday in an interview on ITV that triggering Brexit without a transitional deal would be damaging to all parties. Asked whether a deal is likely, Davies said: "I think that it is possible." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

With more than 1,800 listed companies that have a combined market capitalization of $3.3 trillion, the Shenzhen stock market is viewed by analysts as offering tremendous investment potential. HSBC, in fact, calls it the "largest untapped investment opportunity in the world". But sky high valuations and wild swings in Chinese stock prices mean investment flows from Hong Kong into its northern neighbour could take time to materialize. On the other hand, as Chinese retail investors seek to diversify away from their home market and put their funds into assets in a stronger currency, Hong Kong may be a key beneficiary. "Certainly I don't think you will see significant interest in the northbound part of the connect until you have greater optimism about the outlook for domestic equities," Richard Titherington, head of the Asia Pacific Equities team at JPMorgan Asset Management, told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit in Hong Kong. The launch of the so-called Shenzhen Connect scheme is expected "in a few more days," Charles Li, chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd, said on Friday. The move expands an existing trading link between Hong Kong and Shanghai, allowing foreign investors to trade stocks directly in Shenzhen, the world's second-busiest exchange, from Hong Kong. Speaking at the Shenzhen stock exchange in the first stop of a roadshow in mainland China to promote the trading link, Li urged Chinese investors to diversify their holdings with Hong Kong stocks and joked that with real estate prices in the city so expensive, shares may be a better bet. "China residents have a lot of wealth and they need to preserve the value and add value to it, so they have to diversify their investments," Li said. DELAYED START The Shenzhen Connect had been expected to start more than a year ago, but was put on hold after a slump in the Shenzhen and Shanghai bourses, with stocks diving more than 40 percent and the government implementing a series of measures to prop up markets. China approved the Shenzhen trading scheme in August. Among HSBC's top recommendations to investors on Shenzhen-listed companies are Wanda Cinema Line Co Ltd , China's largest cinema operator, and Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, the world's second largest maker of video surveillance cameras, the bank said a report this month. For Chinese investors facing a weakening economy and currency, investing in mid-size Hong Kong-listed companies may be one way to offset the domestic downturn, investors said. Investment flows into Hong Kong shares since the trading link with Shanghai was unveiled two years ago are nearly double the volumes from Hong Kong into China and the Shenzhen link means "strong southbound inflows" will continue, HSBC said. "We do see pretty strong interest, at least from our client base, in investing in the Shenzhen-Hong Kong link," said Wang Ren, chief financial officer at China Minsheng Financial, the investment arm of China's largest private fund, at the Reuters summit. "In the initial few days definitely we will see a pickup in volume, but it depends on the currency situation. People want to allocate more money offshore," Wang said.

(Carolyn Kaster/AP) The former New York mayor, filing a federal form in 2007, detailed earning $10 million in a year by giving speeches. The man who may nominate him for a Cabinet post repeatedly mocked Hillary Clinton, his opponent, for her many paid speeches after she left office. Share story By ERIC LIPTONand RUSS BUETTNER The New York Times WASHINGTON — It was a golden year for Rudolph Giuliani, a mad dash that would take him to 11 countries on four continents, and by the time 2006 was done, earn him $16 million — a princely sum compared with the $7,000 he claimed to have in 2001, when he went through a divorce. With salaries from a law firm and a consulting firm, and most of all $10 million from 108 speeches he delivered to audiences around the world, the lucrative year of 2006 will now, along with the rest of Giuliani’s career after his tenure as New York’s mayor, be getting a new round of scrutiny if he is nominated as secretary of state or another Cabinet post by President-elect Donald Trump. The blitz of activity by Giuliani in 2006 — speaking to Wall Street banks; oil, gold mining and pharmaceutical companies; and investor groups in Japan and Singapore — is public because the next year he began a campaign for president and had to file a financial-disclosure form. But that public ledger offers the most detailed look at just how Giuliani managed to become so wealthy after he left office, with assets worth tens of millions of dollars, including homes he now owns in Palm Beach, Fla., the Hamptons and New York City.

Giuliani’s speeches and travel that year and in the decade since were often related to business deals he was pursuing, or even standing agreements he had reached, like the one with backers of the dissident Iranian political party known as the Mujahedeen Khalq, which until 2012 was considered a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department. They offer a road map of sorts to the kinds of potential conflict-of-interest questions that are already emerging as Giuliani’s name is floated as a possible Trump Cabinet member, particularly given that Trump repeatedly mocked Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent, for the many paid speeches she and her husband gave after they left public office. “When she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests — in less than two years — secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public,” Trump said in June. “Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs and foreign governments in the years since 2001. They totally own her, and that will never change.” In particular, Trump criticized Clinton’s speeches to Wall Street banks. But Giuliani, in a one-year year period that ended in January 2007, earned $750,000 in speaking fees — before the 20 percent cut taken by the speakers’ agency — for eight speeches he gave to Wall Street banks and other major financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase, Merrill Lynch and Lehman Bros., before its collapse. As with Clinton, there is little public record of what Giuliani said during these events. Giuliani had rules about keeping his remarks private, as a contract “addendum” to which organizations that invited him to speak had to agree makes clear. Giuliani stipulated that his remarks could not be recorded, nor could “general press or other media coverage” of the remarks be allowed without his explicit permission. He also had some elaborate demands, including that if he traveled by private plane, it be a Gulfstream IV or bigger, a plane that costs about $40,000 for a one-day trip within the United States. Years of speeches Some members of the Senate, which will hold hearings and vote on his nomination if Trump selects him, are already saying they want to learn more about Giuliani’s work in the years since he left City Hall. “I’m concerned generally about conflicts of interest on the part of prospective members of the administration, in every role,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said when asked about Giuliani’s business ventures since he left office. “And that concern is well justified in terms of the backgrounds of some of the potential nominees that have been discussed.” Giuliani, in an interview this week, defended his activities since he left office, saying he had been open about his dealings with private companies and foreign states or political parties, including the Iranian group. “My ties to them are completely open,” Giuliani said. Giuliani kept up a feverish pace. In one month alone during 2006, he gave 20 speeches. From 2001 to 2008, the year he ran for president, he was on the road as much as 200 days a year, according to Anthony Carbonetti, a former New York City Hall aide. “Every time I turned, he was calling me from a different country or a different city,” Carbonetti said. For most of those trips, he had a standard speech that mixed a retelling of leadership lessons outlined in his book and memories from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which ultimately earned him the nickname “America’s mayor.” “I heard it so many times, I could have given the speech,” Carbonetti joked. One area of particularly focused travel was Asia. Giuliani formed a partnership with Sage Capital Growth, a Manhattan-based investment firm that was exploring business opportunities in Japan. Giuliani’s disclosure form showed a $300,000 speaking fee for one event in November 2005, the largest single fee on the form, which covered 123 speeches given over a 14-month period. Giuliani was separately retained by Mark Advent, a Las Vegas-based casino developer, to help him with his attempt to build a resort and casino in Singapore. Giuliani personally presented parts of the plan to Singapore’s authorities in hearings during an arduous review process. One of Giuliani most frequent employers as a speaker was HSM, a company that arranges “executive education” events around the world. In 2006, he made eight speeches for the company and was paid $550,000 (his booking agent kept 20 percent of that). At least three times, in 2003, 2004 and 2006, Giuliani was to be among the featured speakers at HSM World Business Forums along with Bill Clinton. The Iranian dissidents The speeches that have drawn the greatest scrutiny are those he gave from 2012 through last year at events organized by the Mujahedeen Khalq, a dissident group of Iranians that holds a rally in France every year to draw attention to the persecution of its members by the government of Iran. Giuliani was paid for “three or four” speeches he delivered to the group, said Robert Torricelli, a former senator from New Jersey who served as a lawyer for the MEK, as the group is known, as it sought to be removed from a State Department list of terrorist organizations. Giuliani, after receiving payments from U.S.-based groups of Iranian immigrants who had ties to the MEK, gave rousing speeches at these annual rallies condemning Iranian leaders and the Obama administration for negotiating with them. “The ayatollah must go,” Giuliani yelled, referring to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, as thousands stood and cheered him. “Gone, out, no more,” he said, adding that Khamenei and other leaders of Iran should “be put on trial for crimes against humanity for the thousands and hundreds of thousands of people that they have killed.” Paul S. Ryan, a vice president for policy and litigation at Common Cause, a nonprofit group that examines special-interest influence in politics, said there would be no legal prohibition on Giuliani moving from being paid by the group to a government job. But he still found it troubling. “People would reasonably question his fitness for this political appointment given that he received payments from supporters of this organization, and these are matters he would be charged with dealing with as secretary of state,” he said. Torricelli said that Giuliani had agreed to give the paid speeches because he supported the group’s message, and that he had volunteered his time to participate in negotiations in Europe to help prevent further attacks on refugees from the group who were then living in Iraq. Giuliani’s work earned him a spot on several lists of the highest-paid speakers in the world, just one spot below Bill Clinton in one ranking. In one instance in 2006, Giuliani collected $100,000 for speaking at Oklahoma State University. His contract with the university, which is public, laid out what appeared to be his standard demands beyond a fee. A room with a view Besides the requests related to air travel, his team required a sedan and an SUV, and an extra SUV for luggage when he traveled to other countries. His room tastes were specific: a “large two-bedroom, nonsmoking suite with a king-size bed, on an upper floor, with a balcony and view if applicable.” He required four more rooms on the same floor for security and staff. Eric Money, who led the speakers bureau at Oklahoma State University at the time Giuliani visited the campus, said Giuliani’s speech to students and faculty members in the university’s basketball arena had focused on leadership and Sept. 11. Money said the fee was high, but he did not recall hearing complaints. “That is what Bill Clinton was getting at the time,” Money said. “It was on par. I did not have sticker shock.” In the afterglow of his post-9/11 fame, Giuliani could certainly ignite large rooms. Giuliani spoke at dozens of events with Zig Ziglar, a motivational speaker. Ziglar’s daughter, Julie Ziglar Norman, who traveled with her father in those years, said Giuliani was a crowd favorite, along with her father and Colin Powell. “I know everybody always loved what he had to say,” Ziglar Norman said. “It was always very pro-American. And he was just beloved. That’s the best way I can describe him.” ERIC LIPTONand RUSS BUETTNER Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday mornings.

Thakor, Washington University in St Louis Published 7:44 pm, Thursday, November 17, 2016 Anjan V. Thakor, Washington University in St Louis Deutsche Bank, a venerable 146-year-old bank whose very name symbolizes the German financial system, has recently found itself in considerable turmoil. The kicker came in September when the Department of Justice slapped it with a US$14 billion fine for alleged wrongdoing during the financial crisis. But Deutsche Bank was already being buffeted by a string of bad news. Its stock price has slumped over the past year due to a decline in investment banking and dim prospects for its commercial banking business. This has led to speculation about whether the German government will have to bail it out and, if it doesn’t, whether markets will soon experience another “Lehman moment” – referring to how the collapse of the U.S. investment bank sparked a global financial meltdown in 2008. As I see it, these concerns obscure the much deeper problem that afflicts the European banking sector and that a bailout alone will do nothing to resolve: a lack of capital. It also offers a stark warning for U.S. regulators amid talk of changes to banking rules – especially Dodd-Frank – under the new administration. While some changes to the U.S. financial system may be worthwhile, easing capital standards would be a mistake and make another financial crisis much more likely. Instead, regulators on both sides of the Atlantic need to make sure there’s no question their banks are able to withstand a shock – whether a billion-dollar fine or something much more severe. While allowing a bank that has the size and prominence of Deutsche Bank to fail is obviously an event that could have seismic repercussions, bailing it out is not something that would be easy for the German government to do. There are many reasons for this. One is reputational. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has been critical of other governments (especially in Europe) for using taxpayer funds to bail out their banks. Second, there is little support among German taxpayers for the bailout, so it would also be politically costly. While it’s interesting to speculate about this, there are other questions that are even more pertinent. First, what is the real problem here? Why is Deutsche Bank in the mess it finds itself in? What can we do to prevent our major financial institutions from being so fragile in the future? There are many factors responsible for what ails Deutsche Bank. Perhaps none figures more prominently than its capital position during and after the crisis. Among its peer institutions, Deutsche Bank is the riskiest based on its “leverage ratio,” which essentially measures how much equity capital it has as a percentage of total assets. On June 30, its leverage ratio stood at a shockingly low 2.68 percent, or about half the average for the eight biggest U.S. banks, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. That means it had only $2.68 in equity for every $100 in assets. A low ratio means it has less cushion if there’s a problem. Since banks are required to mark many of their assets to market, an adverse price movement that reduces the value of its assets by just 3 percent would completely wipe out its equity. We can see that the bank’s low capital is bad from at least two perspectives. One is that a 2.68 percent leverage ratio is less than what Bear Stearns had (2.78 percent) in early 2008 before it collapsed and had to be rescued by the U.S. government via a deal with JPMorgan Chase. Another is that under the Basel III’s capital rules, banks are required to have a leverage ratio exceeding 3 percent. As an interesting contrast, U.S. bank regulators have adopted a 5 percent minimum leverage ratio for domestic banks. (One caveat is that European regulators [European Banking Authority] gave Deutsche Bank a ratio of 2.96 percent earlier this year,slightly higher than what the FDIC gave it, but still very worrisome.) Extensive academic research has revealed that a lot of bad things can happen when a bank has critically low capital. One is that its internal culture gets skewed in favor of growth and excessive risk taking. Deals that can make the bank a lot of money if they pan out (but can also cost the taxpayers a lot) become more attractive. The other consequence is that there is “debt overhang” – so much debt that shareholders are unwilling to infuse any more equity into the bank since most of the benefits of the new equity will flow to the depositors and other creditors. So this creates a sort of “doom spiral”: More equity is needed to rescue the bank, but excessive debt stands in the way. So the government finds itself on the horns of a dilemma, either let the bank fail or infuse taxpayer money to rescue it. Finally, more highly levered banks also make a bigger contribution to systemic risk, which is the risk that the whole system will fail, as we saw during the financial crisis. We see some evidence of these forces operating at Deutsche Bank. Reports suggest the bank is unlikely to raise new equity because its stock price is “too low” and trading at about 25 percent of the book value of its equity. That means the market thinks the value of the bank’s equity is worth just 25 cents when the bank’s balance sheet states it as one dollar. Put slightly differently, if Duetsche bank states its shareholders equity on its balance sheet as $100, the market will actually pay only $25 to buy it. One reason for the low stock price is its dim business prospects, thanks to anemic economic growth in Europe and tighter banking regulations. The other, of course, is the aforementioned debt overhang. With such low capital, it is also hardly surprising that its U.S. unit failed the Federal Reserve Bank’s stress test in June. The only other major bank that failed was the U.S. unit of Santander. When a bank fails a test, it is not allowed to remit dividends back to its parent company and may face harsher sanctions. In addition there is reputational damage and potential loss of customer trust, which can be very damaging to the stock price. Moreover, consistent with the predictions of academic research, the International Monetary Fund named the bank as “the most important net contributor to systemic risk.” In other words, by keeping capital that is too low from a prudential regulation standpoint, Deutsche Bank is creating risk, not only for itself but for the whole global financial system. So, the real problem for global financial stability is not whether Deutsche Bank will be bailed out. It is the question of what bank regulators are going to do to get more equity capital into banking. In this regard, U.S. bank regulators have done considerably better than European (and Japanese) bank regulators. During the financial crisis, the U.S. government took equity stakes in banks, effectively recapitalizing them. When the shareholders of these banks repurchased the government’s stakes, private equity capital replaced taxpayer-provided capital, and the U.S. banking system ended up on a much sounder footing as a result. By contrast, this did not happen in Europe. In fact, banks in Europe lobbied their bank regulators to water down the Basel III capital rules so as to avoid having to raise billions of euros in new capital. As a result, banking fragility in Europe remains considerably higher than in the U.S. What should be done going forward? I think the single biggest regulatory imperative in banking is to get banks to have significantly higher capital ratios, both in the U.S. and in Europe, although the problem in Europe is more pressing. And American taxpayers and bank regulators cannot afford to be smug about American banks being better capitalized than European banks. There may be lobbying of the new administration to water down capital requirements but doing so will be bad for the economy, both here and globally. Hopefully we will not repeat the mistakes made in Europe. We live in a highly interconnected global financial system. European banking fragility imperils the U.S. and indeed the global financial system. Bailouts generally do not foster future financial stability; higher capital does. That’s where the answer lies.

The BOJ can remain on hold unless the yen strengthens past 100 against the dollar, a possibility that is "pretty much gone" following Trump’s victory, Hideo Hayakawa said in an interview Thursday. “An early spring has come to the BOJ,” he said. Hayakawa’s comments add to the views that Kuroda will keep policy unchanged for the rest of his term through April 2018, unless he faces some shock. The yen dropped to an almost six-month low  this week, which should help corporate profits, raise import prices and may boost inflation as well. Former BOJ board member Sayuri Shirai and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have said more easing is unlikely before Kuroda’s term ends, and the share of economists who don’t expect any additional stimulus rose to 35 percent ahead of this month’s policy meeting, according to a Bloomberg survey conducted late October. While Trump’s actual economic policies are unclear, it’s safe to say he would expand the fiscal deficit through tax cuts, said Hayakawa, who left the central bank in 2013. That will fuel inflationary pressures, trigger a rise in bond yields and strengthen the dollar, he said. “This is a bright spot for the BOJ,” although Trump’s rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal must be a headache for the government, he said. Leaders meet Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and President-elect Trump met earlier on Friday, Tokyo time, in New York. The two men had frank discussions at their first meeting, according to Abe, who told reporters that it was a "warm atmosphere" and that the new U.S. leader was "trustworthy." Trump’s victory caused a surge in bond yields in the U.S. and other nations, and the dollar has strengthened against all major currencies except the pound. The yen traded at 110.15 against the dollar as of 9:52 a.m. in Tokyo after touching 110.35 earlier. The BOJ isn’t so concerned about a rapid rise in Japan’s 10-year government bond yield as it remains around zero percent, Hayakawa said. The yield turned positive this week for the first time since Sept. 21. On Thursday the BOJ fired a warning shot at the bond market, announcing its first unlimited fixed-rate purchase operation. This yielded no bids, a sign that it was more of a demonstration exercise than an intended transaction in notes. Hayakawa praised the BOJ’s September decision to shift its target to the yield curve from increasing the monetary base, as this change made the bank’s policies more sustainable. While no additional easing is in sight, Japan’s consumer prices are likely to remain around zero percent even early next year, distant from the 2 percent inflation target, he said.

Yellen sketched a picture of an improving U.S. economy and said "the case for an increase" in interest rates has strengthened. The Fed is widely expected to raise rates when it meets in mid-December. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh) WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen appears unruffled by incoming President Donald Trump’s victory last week. Her remarks to Congress Thursday suggest that the central bank is on track to raise interest rates at its meeting in December, one month before Trumps takes office. She said she has no plans to step down before her four-year term ends in early 2018, reiterated the Fed’s political independence and vigorously defended tougher bank regulations established in the wake of the financial crisis. An improving U.S. economy has bolstered the case for raising interest rates, Yellen told Congress’ Joint Economic Committee. Economic data since Fed policymakers gathered in early November reinforced her view that the economy is making progress toward the Fed’s goals on employment and inflation. She said that at the meeting, she and her colleagues believed that the case for a rate increase “had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon.” Analysts viewed Yellen’s comments as an effort to put financial markets on notice that a rate hike is likely to occur at the Fed’s last meeting of the year on Dec. 13-14. They noted that she dismissed a suggestion that increased market uncertainty after Trump’s election might be cause for a delay. Asked whether it might be better to push back a move until January, Yellen said that uncertainty surrounding Trump’s proposals for tax cuts and infrastructure spending could well last for a good deal longer than one month. “Yellen’s testimony before Congress … further cemented in place expectations that the Fed will hike rates next month,” said Michael Feroli, senior economist at JPMorgan. Asked about her own future, Yellen said it was “fully my intention” to remain as Fed chair until her four-year term ends on Feb. 3, 2018. She said she could not imagine any circumstance that would cause her to leave early, addressing speculation that she might step down once Trump takes office, given his critical comments of her during the election campaign. The Fed raised its key interest rate in December 2015 and projected that it could raise rates as many as four times in 2016. But it deferred as the U.S. economy went through a prolonged soft-patch. The rate has remained in a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent for the entire year. The rate had been at a record low near zero for seven years. Economists are forecasting that the Fed will raise rates by a quarter-point in December and then will boost rates two more times in 2017. Yellen stressed in her testimony that the slow recovery and absence of inflation pressures should allow the Fed to move gradually in raising its key rate, the federal funds rate. “Gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to get to a neutral policy stance over the next few years,” Yellen said, referring to the point where the funds rate is neither promoting economic growth nor slowing growth. As measured by the gross domestic product, the economy grew at a 2.9 percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, the government has estimated, more than twice the rate in the April-June quarter. The unemployment rate is 4.9 percent, around the level typical of a healthy economy, down from 10 percent in 2009. In addition to firmly stating that she has no plans of leaving the Fed before her term as chair is complete, Yellen also made clear that her views on bank regulation differ from Trump’s. Yellen gave a strong defense of the Dodd-Frank Act, passed by Congress in 2010 to increase financial market regulations in an effort to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. After the country lived through a “devastating financial crisis,” Yellen said that “I would not want to see the clock turned back on all the improvements we have made.” Trump and other Republicans have attacked Yellen and other federal bank regulators for imposing too-restrictive rules on banks, pledging that they will seek to repeal major parts of the 2010 law.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases pr @ satprnews.com 360insights Names Tim Rochon CTO as it Launches Consumer Rebates Module for Channel Success Platform™ WHITBY, Ontario–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Unveiling today a new consumer rebate and management module for its Channel Success Platform™ – the world’s first cloud-based sales and marketing incentives software platform – 360insights also announced that it has hired former Loblaw Companies Limited VP of Information Technology Tim Rochon as its Chief Technology Officer (CTO). “With his uniquely powerful combination of business and technology acumen, Tim is the ideal person to lead our future technology vision across an increasing number of market segments,” says 360insights founder and CEO Jason Atkins. “He has a strong track record of leading the vision, development and implementation of customer- and technology-driven innovation.” Rochon is a seasoned information technology and marketing systems manager with more than 20 years of leadership experience in the Canadian retail and financial services sectors, including senior roles at Loblaw, Shoppers Drug Mart, JP Morgan Chase, Sears Canada and CIBC. His role at 360insights is to lead the product development team in its mission to deliver best-in-class, software-based user experiences and business intelligence to the global brands served by 360insights. 360insights, previously known as 360incentives, has grown its business model as a cloud-based channel incentives platform underpinned by a robust state-of-the-art insights analytics engine. Its Channel Success Platform™ shifts the focus from channel program management to channel optimization, delivering for its clients’ higher integrity, data-driven, predictive decisions on where and how they direct their channel marketing spend. Rebates Module The latest development in the 360insights’ Channel Success Platform™ is the enhanced Rebates Module, which enables product manufacturers and marketers who offer promotional rebates to consumers, to deliver the most compelling consumer experience possible with the industry’s best online and mobile claim submission platform. Capitalizing on a multiplicity of consumer touchpoints, the 360insights Rebates Module delivers a transformational rebate experience to consumers and helps marketers increase lifetime customer value by giving them the analytical tools to understand, predict and act on real-world consumer behaviors. The reality is that most consumer rebate programs do not realize their full potential. Customers are often cynical, submissions are cumbersome and the redemption process can be frustrating. Even after the rebate is completed, marketers have no way to measure the results and effectiveness of the promotion. Lost is the opportunity to learn more about the consumer and ensure that the last impression of the brand with them is a good one. “Consumer product companies need to advance their traditional channel marketing practices in order to build brand advocates, make intelligent data-driven decisions and ensure the rebate transaction is a springboard for future brand loyalty, customer retention and increased market share,” Rochon says. “The enhanced Rebates Module we’re launching today enables all that to happen by connecting manufacturers, dealers, sales associates and consumers with a digitized rebate management solution that is seamless, brand-consistent and user-focused from end-to-end,” he says. “It is also the first module enhancement of many more to come that will elevate the value of the Channel Success Platform™.” ABOUT 360insights 360insights.com is the originator of the Channel Success Platform™, the first truly integrated software-as-a-service platform to enable brands to optimize their partner marketing and consumer incentive spend. Based in Whitby, Ontario, the company serves over 100 of the world’s top brands and has expanded to have operations around the USA and UK. In the past year, 360insights has raised over $40 million in private investment capital to accelerate the global growth and adoption of the Channel Success Platform™. With a company culture built around the simple concept of happiness, the company was awarded Employer of the Year honors in the Toronto Region Board of Trade’s 2016 Business Excellence Awards and has been recognized multiple times as one of Canada’s Best Small to Medium Employers.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit The Dark Side Wall Street’s Vampire Squids Pucker Up for Trump Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER The Dark Side Wall Street’s Vampire Squids Pucker Up for Trump But the bond market suggests a more sinister future. by William D. CohanNovember 17, 2016 5:36 pm Email Facebook Twitter Photo-Illustration by Ben Park; From Bloomberg (Flag), by Joshua Lott (Trump), both from Getty Images. “I think he’s smart enough to know that doing something terribly favorable for the Street in the early days is probably not to his benefit,” one senior Wall Street executive told me recently, speaking, of course, of president-elect Donald Trump. “Why stoke the fires of Warren or Sanders or anybody else if you don’t have to?” Nevertheless, this person continued, the financial industry was finding much to like in Trump. “This is pretty tough for a lot of people,” this person said. “In our firm, there were a lot of us that expected a different outcome, but I don’t see anybody wandering around with tears in their eyes.” After eight years of languishing in the wilderness—seemingly ignored and unloved by the Obama administration—Wall Street appears to be buoyed by an election result that has much of America and the international community reeling. Banks have been on a tear since Trump inconceivably won the presidential election last week. JPMorgan Chase’s stock has hit its all-time high, moving up more than 15 percent in a week. Goldman Sachs is up more than 18 percent. Morgan Stanley’s stock is up around 20 percent. The stock of Bank of America, the home of Merrill Lynch for the past eight years, has gone up more than 25 percent. “I think it’s correct for the [stock] market to be aggressive right now,” investor Wilbur Ross, who is under consideration to be Trump’s Commerce Secretary, said on CNBC on Tuesday. “ . . . Trump’s policies, as you can see from everything he’s said . . . are expansive. It’s fiscal policy being put to work.” Wall Street is not without reservations about the president elect. The Street long ago washed its hands of Trump after he singed banks repeatedly by building, dismantling, and then rebuilding his private empire. The only major financial firm still doing corporate business with Trump is Deutsche Bank, and that is despite the fact that Trump sued the bank, in 2008, after he refused to repay the money that he borrowed to build the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago. (Trump claimed a force majeure as a result of what he argued was Deutsche Bank’s role in causing the financial crisis. The parties have since settled their legal dispute.) And then there are Trump’s actual policy prescriptions, which aren’t any rosier for Wall Street. Trump has repeatedly said he favors ending the “carried interest” tax break that allows private-equity moguls and hedge-find titans to pay taxes at lower rates than most ordinary Americans. (Trump, too, said he has benefited from the “carried-interest” provision, as well as from a blizzard of other tax breaks unique to real-estate developers.) He has also said he would like to bring back the Depression-era law that once separated investment banking from commercial banking. But Wall Street, which makes its money from hedging risk and betting on future outcomes, is wagering that the good will outweigh the bad—that Trump won’t follow through on the elimination of the carried interest provision or the reinstatement of Glass-Steagall. (During a speech in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on October 22, where Trump laid out his agenda for his first 100 days, neither of these items made the list.) And some are surely buoyed by Trump’s declaration that he would like to dismantle the still-being-implemented Dodd-Frank law, the 2010 legislation that greatly ratcheted up the regulation of Wall Street in the aftermath of the crisis. (Though that, too, didn’t make the list of topics during the Gettysburg speech.) In the meantime, as that executive seemed to suggest, Wall Street recognizes that it has already won the big bet. Trump’s victory has, at the very least, signaled the end of Elizabeth Warren’s reign of terror against the financial services industry. For nearly a decade, her hot rhetoric has been infinitely worse than any business or legal disputes that Wall Street has had with the president-elect. The future seems brighter, too. Once upon a time—like, 10 days ago—Warren and her partner-in-arms, Bernie Sanders, could eviscerate a banker with little more than a withering glance. Now, Wall Streeters are everywhere. In addition to Ross at Commerce, Trump seems ready to name as Treasury Secretary billionaire Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs partner and the architect of the extraordinarily lucrative 2009 acquisition of IndyMac, a failed California bank, for $1.55 billion. Five years later, Mnuchin sold the bank for $3.4 billion. “Both are good friends of mine but, more importantly, they are two of the smartest people I know,” billionaire investor Carl Icahn tweeted on November 15. Steve Bannon, Trump’s newly appointed White House senior advisor, used to work at Goldman, too, as did hedge-fund manager Anthony Scaramucci, who is also a member of Trump’s transition team. That’s an awful lot of Goldman people on the small Trump team, especially considering Goldman has made a particular point of not doing any business with the guy. VIDEO: Donald Trump’s Short List for Cabinet But Wall Street’s newfound infatuation with Trump isn’t without significant hesitation. The bond market, quite notably, has freaked out over the Trump victory, and that is quite a big deal. The bond market, after all, is a leading indicator of what it will cost ordinary Americans to borrow money in order to buy a new home or car, or to refinance an existing mortgage. Or what it will cost businesses to get a loan to build a new plant, buy new equipment, or hire more people. It will now cost everyone more to borrow money than it did a week ago (albeit at rates that remain low by historical standards). Since the election, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond has increased to around 2.3 percent, from around 1.8 percent on the day of the election—an extraordinary 27 percent upswing in yield for a market that rarely sees such dramatic movement. (The price of 10-year Treasuries has fallen a corresponding amount since bond yields move in inverse proportion to their price.) Not only is the bond market 10 times larger than the equity market, but it is also often a better predictor of how a sudden change in political and fiscal sentiment effects the economy. And right now the bond market is trying to tell us that it fears Trump’s policies will be fiscally irresponsible, as befitting the man who once proudly referred to himself as the “King of Debt.” The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has analyzed Trump’s plan to spend $1 trillion on overdue infrastructure projects while also dramatically cutting corporate and personal income tax rates and concluded that the national debt would increase to more than $27 trillion during the next decade, from around $20 trillion today. For a man who campaigned on the promise of reducing our national debt, a projected 35 percent increase is not exactly heartwarming. Of course, Trump and his team of supply-side, trickle-down aficionados—such as Ross, Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore —dispute the Tax Policy Center’s analysis. They are busy arguing that the combination of tax cuts and infrastructure spending will get the economy roaring again, and that 4 percent annual G.D.P. growth should be expected. With that kind of growth, tax receipts would presumably flood the Treasury and our national debt, now 105 percent of G.D.P., would be greatly reduced, not greatly increased. This is a specious argument at best, but one I found myself having on CNN the other night with Grover Norquist, another of the old Reagan-era warhorses. Norquist’s point was the old saw about how tax cuts will be a huge stimulus to economic growth. But he forgets to mention how the Reagan tax cuts, along with those by the two Bushes, vastly increased the national debt and the nation’s level of income inequality. I argued that it’s easy to say on national television that G.D.P growth will miraculously ratchet up to 4 percent. It’s a lot more difficult for that to actually happen Even on Wall Street, some people recognize the flaws in Trumpian arithmetic. I had lunch the other day with a senior banker—a Hillary Clinton supporter—at a boutique firm, and he was lamenting the turn of events. Yes, he said, he was sad his preferred candidate had lost. Yes, he said, he was sad about what he feared a Donald Trump presidency would mean for the nation, notwithstanding the benefits that might accrue to him personally and to his firm. “Do I really need another flat-screen TV on my wall if the price we have to pay for that is Trump?” he asked, wistfully, as he tucked into this lightly grilled swordfish.

Now, according to CNBC, Trump has decided to expand beyond just Goldman alumni, and is allegedly considering JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon as the next US Treasury Secretary. BREAKING: Trump advisers considering $JPM CEO Dimon for Treasury post - sources https://t.co/Unij5oIyNe pic.twitter.com/TezAC3aOn0 — CNBC (@CNBC) November 10, 2016 Needless to say, we can only hope that this is an attempt to scare clicks by CNBC instead of the actual truth, because if Trump hopes that he can "drain a swamp" by hiring the swamp puppet master, he - and millions of his supporters - will be very disappointed. As for Dimon, or Mnuchin, they will be delighted: as a reminder, as Hank Paulson demonstrated so well, the only reason why bankers become Treasury Secretaries, is to be allowed to sell all their corporate stock upon moving to public office, *tax free.* That said, as CNBC also adds, Dimon passed on the opportunity: "In the wake of Donald Trump's upset victory, advisors have floated the idea of naming Jamie Dimon as treasury secretary, according to two people familiar with the matter, but one of them added that the JPMorgan chief has said he would not be interested in the role."** » View on web 0 shares Share on FacebookShare on TwitterPost on  RedditShare by Email   Source: Bloomberg Global Business - 5 days ago< > Embed Trump Said to Eye Mnuchin for Treasury Secretary 04:05 Nov. 14 -- Former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin is reported to have been recommended for U.S. Treasury Secretary by President-Elect Donald Trump's transition team.

After Trump's victory, prison corporation stocks skyrocketed by Nadia Prupis, staff writer 0 Comments A protest takes place outside a GEO Group detention center for asylum seekers in Denver, Colorado. (Photo: Justin Valas/flickr/cc) A new report from the research organization In the Public Interest (ITPI) highlights the banks that finance the private prison industry—and with a Trump administration on the horizon, they could be in for a windfall. Six banks have played a major part in bankrolling the two largest private prison firms, CoreCivic (formerly the Corrections Corporation of America) and the GEO Group: Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, and U.S. Bancorp, according to the ITPI's report, The Banks That Finance Private Prison Companies. CoreCivic and GEO Group use the banks' financing—which comes in the forms of loans, bonds, and credit—to buy up smaller companies that conduct residential reentry and sell ankle monitors for border agents to place on detained asylum seekers. That has allowed the two corporations to quietly monopolize the corrections and immigration enforcement industries. The banks, meanwhile, profit by collecting fees and interest on those loans, or investing their clients' money in the corporations' shares. At the end of June 2016, CoreCivic and GEO Group were $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion in debt, respectively. Activists and lawmakers have long criticized the privatization of the prison industry and its partnership with Wall Street. As Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) told International Business Times on Thursday, "It is wrong for private enterprises to bring a profit motive to incarceration and rehabilitation in this country, and I'm particularly concerned by how it’s fueled by tax law. In my view, most taxpayers would be disturbed to learn that their dollars are subsidizing corporate profits from the mass incarceration of minority and low-income Americans." And yet, as IBT points out, the relationship between Wall Street and the mass incarceration industry is likely to get a lot cozier under President-elect Donald Trump, who has previously expressed his support of privatization—especially for prisons and detention centers. IBT's Avi Asher-Schapiro writes: During the course of the presidential campaign, the private prison industry surfaced as an issue: Under pressure from activists, Hillary Clinton returned donations from GEO Group and eventually called for the end of for-profit detention. Trump charted a different course; the president-elect's Super PAC took in $100,000 from GEO Group, and he praised the industry on the campaign trail. "I do think we can do a lot of privatizations and private prisons," Trump told Chris Matthews last March. "It seems to work a lot better." Benjamin Davis, a researcher with the ITPI, told Shapiro that CoreCivic and GEO Group "need Wall Street to survive. They are dependent on the debt." Under President Barack Obama, the U.S. Department of Justice has said it would phase out the use of private detention—but under a Trump administration, IPTI expects that to change. In fact, immediately after Trump's shocking victory, CoreCivic and GEO Group's stocks skyrocketed—showing that, as In These Times put it on Thursday, "a President Trump is just what the private prison industry ordered." Many of GEO Group's facilities have been accused of violating prisoners' human rights. The Reeves County Detention Center in Texas was investigated by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2015, while the nearby Karnes County Detention Center was the site of a hunger strike by incarcerated mothers. Mercedes Castillo, an immigration and criminal defense lawyer in Los Angeles, told In These Times, "I am disheartened, stressed, anxious, and at a loss. Right now, after several of my clients have called, texted, emailed, Facebooked—sat in my office and cried— I have nothing to say but, 'I will fight for you and with you.'" "GEO group might be licking its lips right about now," Davis told IBT. "Trump's talking tough on crime, deportations, national stop and frisk—many signs point to a momentum shift towards more private prisons."

Sign up for The Power Lunch: Florida Politics newsletter - our must-read, weekday roundup of Florida political news and buzz >> Business Workplace Small Business Administration: Lending surpasses $1 billion mark in S. Florida District Marcia Heroux PoundsContact Reporter South Florida District’s small business loans surpass billion-dollar mark, data shows. Privacy Policy More small business owners snagged government-guaranteed loans to expand their businesses in fiscal 2016, new data from the Small Business Administration shows. The SBA's South Florida District saw lending of nearly $1.3 billion during this fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, which is an 8 percent increase over a year ago, the SBA announced Thursday. This is the second consecutive year that South Florida has exceeded the billion-dollar lending mark, according to the SBA district office in Miami. At the same time, the number of loans made by banks in the program increased by 12 percent. There were 2,709 district-wide loans, compared with 2,417 in fiscal 2015. "As we've recovered from the recession, it's the stronger small businesses that break the ice and get the loans," said Francisco "Pancho" Marrero, director of the South Florida District, which includes Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties and 21 other counties. "I'm confident this will go on. There's energy out there from the small business community, a sense of expansion, and I think it's translating into our numbers." Under the SBA lending program, business owners have lower down payments and often can take out longer loans, said Peter Salas, regional manager for specialty finance at JPMorgan Chase. "The SBA allows 20 to 25 years amortization," he said. Since the recession ended, more businesses have become profitable in the past two to three years and can invest in expansion. "Instead of repairing old equipment, they're replacing equipment. Instead of renting a warehouse, they're owning that warehouse," Salas said. Jeffrey Zaslow, co-founder of Overseas Aircraft Parts in Deerfield Beach, said he has a $2 million loan through the SBA that he has been able to renew for 15 years to finance the company's inventory. The 25-year-old company provides aircraft engines, parts and materials to airlines around the world. "Our business is very capital-intensive. While we don't need the SBA loan for day to day, we need it to acquire inventory," he said. The SBA approved 420 loans worth $191 million in Broward County, 316 loans worth $153 million in Palm Beach County, and 543 loans worth $232 million in Miami-Dade County. In total, the three counties saw an 8 percent increase in loan count over fiscal year 2015. Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase banks were the largest lenders in the tricounty region during the year. In the SBA's primary loan program called 7(a), bank lending rose 12 percent to 2,406 loans over 2,139 in fiscal 2015. These are loans that provide financing to purchase equipment and machinery, inventory, fixtures and accessories, renovations and land, as well as construct new buildings, acquire existing businesses and repay debts. Nationally, the SBA approved more than 70,000 loans totaling $28.9 billion in loan programs for fiscal 2016. The total number and dollar amount of 7(a) loans increased by 1 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively, over the previous year. Marrero said the agency has increased lending from fiscal years 2011 to 2016 by 65 percent to Hispanics, 45 percent to African-Americans, 34 percent to women, and 13 percent to veteran business owners. "The SBA made strides ensuring business capital reaches those who need it most," he said. mpounds@sunsentinel.com or 561-243-6650 Copyright © 2016, Sun Sentinel JPMorgan Chase & Co.

(Lucas Jackson/Reuters) The close: TSX rises as Yellen signals rate hike coming Add to ... Reuters Published Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016 1:34PM EST Last updated Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016 4:04PM EST Comments AA Global stock indexes rose along with the U.S. dollar on Thursday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the central bank could raise interest rates “relatively soon.” Ms. Yellen, who testified on the economic outlook before the congressional Joint Economic Committee, indicated little had changed following the victory of Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. She said she intended to serve out her term, which ends in 2018, and indicated the Fed remained on track to raise rates at its meeting next month. Expectations have been high among investors that the Fed will raise rates in December. The dollar receded earlier in the day from a 13-1/2 year peak, though it turned higher after upbeat U.S. economic data stoked expectations of an acceleration in U.S. economic expansion in the fourth quarter. The dollar index, tracking the greenback relative to a basket of six foreign currencies, extended gains in U.S. afternoon trading following Yellen’s comments and was last up 0.5 per cent. In Toronto, Canada’s main stock index gained on Thursday in a broad rally as the country’s largest oil and gas company forecast higher production and lower costs in 2017. Suncor Energy Inc. rose 0.5 per cent after it said it expected production to rise by more than 13 per cent next year and spending to fall by more than $1-billion. The overall energy group finished slightly higher. Nine of the index’s 10 main groups were in positive territory, with only materials stocks down on the day. The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was up 92.87 points, or 0.63 per cent, at 14,826.09. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. erases a big early decline, finishing up 1.1 per cent to health care stocks higher. The head of the drugmaker’s mail-order pharmacy affiliate and a former Valeant manager were indicted on federal charges that they defrauded shareholders. The executives Andy Davenport and Gary Tanner were charged by federal prosecutors in Manhattan on multiple counts including wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money. Valeant shares fell 5 per cent early Thursday after news of the arrests broke. The price recovered following an afternoon news conference at which Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said investigators are continuing to look for potential corruption and fraud that may have harmed shareholders and the marketplace U.S. stocks, which rallied after Mr. Trump’s surprise White House win on the potential for economic stimulus, edged up, led by a 1.2-per-cent gain in financials, which benefit from higher rates. “A December rate hike is priced in. A number of Fed speakers have indicated that and they want the market to be prepared for when they do,” said Erik Wytenus, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “The Fed, though, is sensitive to the strength of the dollar and they don’t want to hike too far too quickly.” The Dow Jones industrial average was unofficially up 35.68 points, or 0.19 per cent, to 18,903.82. The S&P 500  gained 10.18 points, or 0.47 per cent, to 2,187.12, , approaching its Aug. 15 closing record of 2,190.15. The Nasdaq Composite added 39.39 points, or 0.74 per cent, to 5,333.97.  “We’re still basking in the aftermath of the Trump election victory because of expectations for fiscal stimulus via lower corporate tax rates, but as time goes on investors will reposition based on what’s actually happening,” said J.J. Feldman, portfolio manager at Los Angeles-based Miracle Mile Advisors. Mr. Trump’s expected increase in infrastructure spending is also expected to boost economic activity and inflation, and raises the possibility of more interest rate hikes. Traders are pricing in an 83-per-cent chance of a December move, according to Thomson Reuters data. MSCI’s all-country world stock index was up 0.3 per cent, while Europe’s STOXX 600   rose 0.6 per cent. In the U.S. bond market, the yield curve steepened after the U.S. data suggested the labour market is tightening and inflation is beginning to gain traction. That prompted investors to sell government debt with longer-dated maturities. U.S. consumer prices posted their biggest increase in six months in October, while housing starts surged to a 9-year high, and jobless claims fell to the lowest since November 1973. The 10-year note fell 15/32 in price to yield 2.275 per cent. Overseas, the Bank of Japan offered to buy unlimited bonds for the first time under a revamped policy framework as domestic debt yields surged in the wake of Trump’s election victory. More broadly, Japan’s efforts will raise questions about how far central banks such as the European Central Bank and others will be willing to tolerate steep and sudden rises in government borrowing costs. Oil prices settled slightly lower on Thursday, then fell as much as 1 per cent in the after-market session as a stronger dollar outweighed expectations of an OPEC deal to limit production. Oil started the day in the positive, with U.S. crude briefly up by as much as $1, on optimism that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would reach an agreement to cap production at its meeting in Vienna on Nov. 30. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he was optimistic about OPEC’s deal to limit oil output, while Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said OPEC members are ready to reach a “forceful” agreement, following a meeting with OPEC Secretary-General. But prices fell after the dollar index tapped a 13-1/2-year high on strong U.S. economic data and comments by Ms. Yellen that bolstered the case for hiking interest rates next month. The stronger dollar makes the greenback-denominated crude more expensive for holders of other currencies. “The strength in the dollar, that rate hike being priced in, is more of a concrete thing than the rumors and murmurs and ongoing rhetoric related to OPEC,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at energy data provider ClipperData. Brent crude settled down 14 cents a barrel at $46.49, before falling further to $46.12, down 51 cents, or 1.1 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude closed 15 cents lower at $45.42. It fell in post-settlement by 56 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $45,01. Gold fell to a 5-1/2-month low on Thursday, giving up earlier gains as the dollar index tapped a 13-1/2-year high on strong U.S. economic data and Ms. Yellen’s . Spot gold was down 0.8 per cent at $1,215.50 an ounce, after falling to $1,210.73, the lowest since June 3. U.S. gold futures settled down 0.6 per cent at $1,216.90 per ounce. Gold turned lower as the U.S. dollar rose to the highest since 2003 against a basket of six major currencies. “With the move up in the dollar, that will continue to pressure gold prices,” said Dan Heckman, national investment consultant for U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Kansas City. “Looking beyond today, we think that perhaps the dollar is starting to peak out a little bit in the near term and we might get a little bounce here in gold.” With a file from Bloomberg News Report Typo/Error Also on The Globe and Mail Target's profit surges (Reuters)   MSFT-QMicrosoft Corp Latest Price$60.35 -0.29 (-0.48%) WMT-NWal Mart Stores Inc Latest Price$68.54 -0.65 (-0.94%) GC-FTGold Front Month Futures Latest Price$1,208.50 0.00 (0.00%) CL-FTCrude Oil Front Month Futures Latest Price$45.69 0.00 (0.00%) TSXS&P/TSX Composite Latest Price14,864.03 +37.94 (+0.26%) SU-TSuncor Energy Inc Latest Price$41.81 +0.59 (+1.43%) DJIADow Jones Industrials Latest Price18,867.93 -35.89 (-0.19%) COMPNASDAQ NMS COMPOSITE INDEX Latest Price5,321.51 -12.46 (-0.23%) SPXS&P 500 INDEX Latest Price2,181.90 -5.22 (-0.24%) CSCO-QCisco Systems Inc Latest Price$30.18 +0.13 (+0.43%) BBY-NBest Buy Co Inc Latest Price$44.79 -1.20 (-2.61%) AAPL-QApple Inc Latest Price$110.06 +0.11 (+0.10%) WFC-NWells Fargo & Co Latest Price$52.82 +0.33 (+0.63%) BAC-NBank of America Corp Latest Price$20.00 -0.08 (-0.40%) Updated November 17 7:01 PM CDT. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

Regulators have spent almost three years investigating whether hiring by the American firm overseas violated US the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). To end the probe and settle charges it violated the law, JP Morgan has agreed to pay $130m to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), $72m to the Justice Department and $61.9m to the Federal Reserve. The SEC said the bank had hired about 100 employees and interns over seven years who had been referred to it by foreign government officials, which resulted in the lender either winning or keeping hold of business that generated revenues of over $100m. According to the regulator, investment bankers at JP Morgan in Asia went around the firm’s standard hiring procedures by setting up a scheme in 2006 that enabled government officials and other clients to put forward candidates for jobs, which the bank described as a “Sons and Daughters” programme. The Securities and Exchange Commission regulates Wall Street Credit: Reuters The SEC described JP Morgan’s misconduct as “blatant”, with bankers at the firm keeping spreadsheets to record the money that came from customers who had secured jobs for their children. At least $35m of JP Morgan’s profits were a result of the hiring programme, the SEC estimated. The fine is likely to rattle other banks as it has been common practice for businesses operating in China to employ potentially influential people. The Justice Department is thought to be examining the hiring practices of other US banks in the country. Andrew Ceresney, the director of the SEC’s enforcement division, said: “JP Morgan engaged in a systematic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials and other favoured referrals who were typically unqualified for the positions on their own merit.” He said that the bank’s employees “knew the firm was potentially violating the FCPA yet persisted with the improper hiring programme because the business rewards and new deals were deemed too lucrative”. The fine took into account the fact that J Morgan, which is led by Jamie Dimon, co-operated with the SEC’s probe, and a spokesman for the bank said “we’re pleased that our co-operation was acknowledged in resolving these investigations”. The spokesman added: “The conduct was unacceptable. We stopped the hiring programme in 2013 and took action against the individuals involved. We have also made improvements to our hiring procedures and reinforced the high standards of conduct expected of our people.” Shares in JP Morgan were up 1.2pc following the fine amid investor relief the bank had put the probe behind it. RBC Capital Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy said the lender had set aside funds for the settlements and therefore he "did not expect any impact to earnings”.

Yellen, who was testifying on the economic outlook before the congressional Joint Economic Committee, indicated little had changed yet following the victory of Donald Trump in the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election. She said she intended to serve out her term, which ends in 2018, and indicated the Fed remained on track to raise rates at its meeting next month. The dollar receded earlier in the day from a 13-1/2 year peak, though it turned higher after upbeat U.S. economic data, that stoked expectations of an acceleration of U.S. economic expansion in the fourth quarter, helped the dollar. The dollar index, tracking the greenback relative to a basket of key foreign currencies, was last up 0.1 percent. U.S. stocks, which rallied after Republican Donald Trump's surprise White House win, were mostly higher. "A December rate hike is priced in. A number of Fed speakers have indicated that and they want the market to be prepared for when they do," said Erik Wytenus, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. "The Fed, though, is sensitive to the strength of the dollar and they don't want to hike too far too quickly." The Dow Jones industrial average was up 3.35 points, or 0.02 percent, to 18,871.49, the S&P 500 had gained 6.81 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,183.75 and the Nasdaq Composite had added 24.57 points, or 0.46 percent, to 5,319.15. MSCI's all-country world stock index was up 0.3 percent, while Europe's STOXX 600 was up 0.5 percent. In the U.S. bond market, the yield curve steepened after the U.S. data suggested the labor market is tightening and inflation is beginning to gain traction. That prompted investors to sell government debt with longer-dated maturities. U.S. consumer prices posted their biggest increase in six months in October, while housing starts surged to a 9-year high and jobless claims fell to the lowest since November 1973. The 10-year note fell 11/32 in price to yield 2.263 percent. Earlier, the Bank of Japan offered to buy unlimited bonds for the first time under a revamped policy framework, as domestic debt yields surged in the wake of Donald Trump's upset U.S. election victory. More broadly, Japan's efforts will raise questions about how far central banks such as the ECB and others will be willing to tolerate steep and sudden rises in government borrowing costs. Oil prices were higher as expectations of an OPEC deal to limit production outweighed global oversupply concerns. Brent crude oil was up 17 cents a barrel at $46.8, while U.S. was up 28 cents at $45.85.

Macy's products were among those on display at the FoodBizNJ event. - (AARON HOUSTON) Three food manufacturers and online retailers — who create different premium products without using preservatives by sourcing clean ingredients — walk into a room. No, that’s not an incredibly elaborate set up for a joke: It was the foundation for one of the most overlooked panels at the inaugural FoodBizNJ event on Nov. 2. “Food Manufacturers: Trends, Opportunities and Challenges,” moderated by Betty Janelle, executive director of the agribusiness and food banking division of JPMorgan Chase, brought together John Macy, founder and president of John Wm. Macy’s Family Bakery in Elmwood Park, Carlos Vega, founder and president of Jersey Italian Gravy in Woodcliff Lake, and Patrick Leger, co-founder and co-owner of First Field in Skillman, to discuss the most common issues and topics facing their small businesses today. Here are some highlights from their conversation: Capitalizing on 'clean' ingredients “We have always had a clean label — we never even thought otherwise,” Leger said. “It is how we are different from our competitors, who have had a really hard time trying to retroactively clean up their products and have lost a lot of their credibility in coming out with something fresh against somebody like us who always used pure and simple ingredients from the get-go.” First Field’s minimalist brand label, created by a professional children’s book artist in Canada, reflects the fact that the company is above all committed to using clean ingredients. “We had always felt that product labels had way too much messaging — what it has, what it doesn’t — and we wanted our consumers to be able to develop an emotional reaction to our label rather than be told what to think,” Leger said. “We respect our consumers to do the research and understand what is going on. We see that more now with millennials, who want to know everything about their products. … So the idea was to provide a mosaic canvas to encompass this kind of authentic feeling.” Jersey Italian Gravy Carlos Vega, founder and president of Jersey Italian Gravy, left behind his corporate job in finance to purchase a beloved childhood pizzeria in West New York. He simply could not resist the “gravy” they had used that always resulted in unforgettable flavor. “When we bought the pizzeria, we were making 40 quarts of gravy every two weeks,” Vega said. “We tweaked the all-natural recipe and, by the time we were done with our new recipe, we were moving 40 quarts a day. Everyone was always asking for extra gravy.” Vega later sold the pizzeria and began to jar his “intellectual property” to become Jersey Italian Gravy in Woodcliff Lake in 2012. Today, over a dozen varieties of his marinara and vodka sauces are sold in over 4,000 stores nationwide, including even in Bed, Bath & Beyond, Stew Leonard’s and Christmas Tree Shops. Authenticity, Vega agreed, is key. “You don’t need a lot of ingredients to have a good product — it’s just about the sourcing of good tomatoes and the cooking processes,” he said. “People complicate things by adding junk, which is overpowering what the natural product should taste like.” Since Jersey Italian Gravy manufactures sauce on demand, Vega said it was imperative that it found a good manufacturing partner to ensure the right temperatures and quality control when packing. “We deliver the jars still hot to our customer — the hot packing is really what maintains the two-year shelf life on our products,” Vega said. Macy said his company has come a long way in terms of how it has packaged and sold its product. “In the beginning, we didn't even have a label — we were just selling directly to specialty shops who would put our products out on their counters and stack them up like log cabins,” he said. “The perception was, on the part of the consumer, that if it was being sold there, it was fine. Once we packaged our product, using ingredients you would find in your home kitchen, we learned that there was value in that.” While having a “clean” product and marketing it as such can be extremely lucrative these days, Macy said it is also important to remain vigilant in one’s market. “For a long time, we had written ‘all natural’ across the bottom of our packaging,” Macy said. “We actually just took that off, because word got around in the industry that there is a group of litigants specifically looking for (food manufacturers) making baked products with enriched flour, which was strongly recommended by the FDA in the 1940s as a means of getting Americans the nutrients that were leeched out in processing. It was earnest in its intent, but the nutrients that were being added back in were synthetically produced and therefore not ‘all natural.’ “All it takes it for one activist attorney to bring a class action lawsuit against you, and it becomes very expensive to defend yourself.” Increasing food safety measures Macy ran into a rather costly issue when creating a private label product for Nature’s Promise. John Wm. Macy’s Family Bakery John Macy, founder and president of John Wm. Macy’s Family Bakery, began his career in catering after college. He developed a recipe for spicy, twisted breadsticks with cheddar cheese and sourdough to serve to his clients in California. When he moved to New York in 1979, he installed a small oven and dough sheeter in his East Village apartment to continue baking and selling his “CheeseSticks.” By 1985, Macy’s recipe had become so successful that he was able to open a small storefront in the Lower East Side and began selling to multiple specialty retailers. John Wm. Macy’s Family Bakery, which relocated to Elmwood Park in 1990, has since developed over a dozen different snacks since to sell to retailers such as Kings Food Markets and ShopRite. “While it has been very difficult to balance the growth of sales with the growth of our manufacturing capabilities, that has pretty much been our story for the nearly 25 years that we’ve been here,” Macy said. “And we are still seeing lots of new opportunities.” “The chocolate had all of its sub-ingredients properly declared, but soy was not bolded to identify it as an allergen. A buyer picked up on that, called and said they wanted us to take it all back,” he said. “If you’re not really careful, and your ingredient labels have a typo, you have the responsibility to take it out of the marketplace.” The error may not even be on your part, Vega added. “If you buy onions and tomatoes from the same grower and get a notification from them that there is E.coli, for example, then everything you ran with that batch has to be taken off the shelves,” Vega said. That is why retailers are now requiring additional “product sabotage” insurance to carry any size manufacturer’s products. “We just got hit with it this year; it cost us over $15,000 for a $2 million policy — and that’s on top of all of our other insurances,” Vega said. “It’s expensive, yes, but it does give you peace of mind should (a recall) happen.” Macy’s typographical error, he said, also cost his company several thousand dollars. But Macy said he still believes it is a good thing that the bar has been raised in terms of global food safety initiatives and measures. “It makes you better and it is worth doing,” he said.   'Private label' manufacturing John Wm. Macy’s Family Bakery has had a good track record of producing “private label” products for other brands. Macy said he sees competition as being severely limited. “Chances are, if (a retailer) likes your product, they are not going to go to a contract manufacturer and say, ‘Can you match this?’ They are going to come to you,” Macy said. “You have the first opportunity — now, your margins have to fit within their formulas or they may have to go somewhere else. … The other thing you have to consider is that you may be competing with yourself, essentially — does that undermine the integrity of your brand? “Well, you may have to at some point. If you have a facility with fixed costs, as we do, you have an obligation to your staff and everyone that your business touches to stay in business. What is the volume you need to keep the lights on?” For Jersey Italian Gravy, Vega was able to rise to the challenge by thinking outside of the box. First Field What began as a family tradition and a hobby abroad has grown into a Skillman-based premium condiment brand ripe for growth. “We have terrible tomatoes in Quebec, but we made this homemade ketchup around the holidays to use in game dishes,” Patrick Leger, co-founder and co-owner of First Field, said. After relocating to New Jersey, Leger began tweaking and selling his mother’s traditional ketchup recipe by setting up an honors-system farm stand at the end of his driveway. His wife, Theresa Viaggiano, saw an opportunity to jar and sell it on a much bigger scale. The couple founded First Field in 2011 to manufacture all-natural original and roasted ketchups — with about half as much sugar and salt as other brands — as well as a cranberry sauce, pickle relish and pure strained and crushed tomatoes using fresh, fair trade ingredients. The company currently sells to retailers such as Kings Food Markets and Whole Foods. “We have been approached by retailers a few times to (make) private label products for them. We don’t do that, so we turned around and said, ‘Why don’t you give us the opportunity to make a brand new and unique recipe for you?’ ” Vega said. Whole Foods, he said, was the first one on board. “We came up with a Brooklyn-based marinara sauce for them. Then they took it a step further and said, ‘This is great, but why don’t we have your logo on your brand?’ ” Vega said. “Now, we are co-branding the sauce with them. Other retailers took note of that and started coming to us with the same request.” Not all of the distributors choose to put Vega’s logo on their jars, however. “But they are all our recipes. Out of (over a dozen types of products) we make, eight of them are co-branded or made exclusively for other retailers or distributors,” Vega said. This is a terrific option for both manufacturers and retailers, Vega said, in an age where consumers are beginning to wise up to what “private label” really means. It can also mean added security for manufacturers. “It is on (my partners’) manufacturing agreements that it is their recipe for as long as they continue to manufacture with us, but when we walk out that door, it’s ours,” Vega said. “That’s the way you keep the partnership.” For First Field, it is less about private label manufacturing or co-branding, and more about licensing strategies for the brand. “It’s complicated to work with farmers and process your own product. That is not simply something that can be ‘private-labeled’ away,” Leger said. “I see it as a trend that will endure — it is just the nature of economics — but even so, there is always room for nice brands to exist, even though we are competing against pantry staples that may be more competitive in price. We are challenged to grow and maintain our business by being different in our various spaces — and if consumers like a premium product and it continues to deliver on the qualities that they desire, people will continue to buy it.” While First Field is primarily a tomato business, Leger said, he does not want to be pigeonholed into any one product category. “We think we have the best tomatoes here in New Jersey and we have the access to them to make good products,” Leger said. “But, let’s say there is fantastic produce in another part of the country that we can make a value-added product from and be able to maintain quality control of the supply chain — if we are able to work directly with farmers from a fair trade perspective and if our operating philosophy existed in other businesses with fantastic access to product, that would definitely be something to think about.” More Garden State Grub • At FoodBizNJ, food and beverage industry leaders address $15 minimum wage issue • Welcome to the newest NJBIZ blog, Garden State Grub, covering all things food, beverage and business • Family-owned Laird, 236 years old, is jacked up over new revolution in cider and other apple liquors Share This Story On: Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn   Meg Fry Follow @MegFry3 Meg Fry writes about women in business, millennials, food and beverage, manufacturing and retail.

Continue Reading Below The Dow, which snapped its seven-day rally on Wednesday, was little changed, weighed down by a fall in Wal-Mart <WMT.N>. Shares of the world’s largest retailer fell 4.4 percent after reporting lower-than-expected quarterly comparable sales. Yellen said the central bank could raise interest rates “relatively soon” and was prepared to adjust its outlook as the new administration takes shape. U.S. stocks had been on a tear since Trump’s surprise victory last week, with the Dow closing at a record level four days in a row. The rally lost steam this week as investors seek clarity on Trump’s campaign promises and brace for higher interest rates. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT Trump’s proposals to cut taxes and raise infrastructure spending are expected to boost economic activity and inflation, raising the possibility of more interest rate hikes. That sent the dollar index <.DXY> to a near 14-year high. Traders are pricing in an 83 percent chance of a December move, according to Thomson Reuters data. “A December rate hike is priced in. A number of Fed speakers have indicated that and they want the market to be prepared for when they do,” said Erik Wytenus, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. “The Fed though is sensitive to the strength of the dollar and they don’t want to hike too far too quickly.” At 11:03 a.m. ET the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> was down 17.19 points, or 0.09 percent, at 18,850.95. The S&P 500 <.SPX> was up 3.93 points, or 0.18 percent, at 2,180.87. The Nasdaq Composite index <.IXIC> was up 13.10 points, or 0.25 percent, at 5,307.69. Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors were higher, with the financial index’s <.SPSY> 0.75 percent rise leading the advancers. JPMorgan <JPM.N> and Bank of America <BAC.N> were up about 1 percent, boosting the sector. U.S. consumer prices recorded their biggest increase in six months in October, data showed. The Consumer Price Index increased 0.4 percent last month after rising 0.3 percent in September. In other data, U.S. housing starts surged to a more than nine-year high in October and the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell to a 43-year low last week. Cisco <CSCO.O> fell 5.3 percent to $29.90 after its current-quarter forecast fell below analysts’ estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,590 to 1,236. On the Nasdaq, 1,613 issues rose and 1,015 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 19 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 180 new highs and 13 new lows.

Selena Maranjian (TMFSelena) Nov 17, 2016 at 11:03AM When people refer to "the stock market" being up or down, odds are they have merely heard that the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) is up or down. If you want to be a successful investor, it's important to understand what such indexes really are and how they can help you invest better. Let's take a closer look at the S&P 500. Image source: Getty Images. It's old The S&P 500 was launched in March of 1957, the year that West Side Story opened on Broadway and Paul McCartney met John Lennon. It originally held mostly industrial companies as well as some utilities and railroads. Financial companies were only added in the 1970s. Image source: Pixabay. 500 stocks, 80% of the market The S&P 500 has 500 component companies. As there are several thousand companies that are publicly traded in the U.S. market, 500 may not seem quite that significant. But get this -- they are 500 of the biggest companies in America and together, they make up about 80% of the overall market's value! Thus, as Standard & Poor's itself says, "The S&P 500 is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities." The top 10 holdings recently were Apple, Microsoft, ExxonMobil, Johnson & Johnson, Amazon.com, Facebook, Berkshire Hathaway, General Electric, JPMorgan Chase, and Google parent Alphabet. It's market-weighted The S&P 500 index is  the first U.S. market-cap-weighted index. The much older Dow Jones Industrial Average (which comprises just 30 companies), by contrast, is price-weighted. With a price-weighted index, the stocks with the highest prices will have the most influence, no matter how big or small the underlying company is. For example, Microsoft recently sported a share price near $60 and a market capitalization near $460 billion, while UnitedHealth Group had a share price near $150 and a market cap of $144 billion. Clearly, Microsoft is a much bigger company -- yet in a price-weighted system, UnitedHealth's stock moves would have more than twice the effect on the index as Microsoft's. The S&P 500, though, being market-cap-weighted, gives much more influence to Microsoft than UnitedHealth. Image source: Getty Images. Most funds lose to it You might assume that stock mutual funds managed by financial professionals who study stocks closely, deciding which to buy and sell, would perform better than simple index funds like those based on the S&P 500, which merely hold the same stocks as the index, with little decision-making required. You'd be wrong, though. Index funds tend to outperform actively managed funds. Indeed, according to Standard & Poor's, as of the end of June 2016, fully 87% of all domestic stock mutual funds underperformed the S&P 1500 Composite Index over the past 10 years. And 85% of large-cap stock funds underperformed the S&P 500. It's inexpensive to invest in Given that so many managed stock funds can't beat the S&P 500, it's quite sensible to just invest in an S&P 500 index fund. None other than superinvestor Warren Buffett endorses that idea: He says  that in his will, he offers these instructions for the money left for his wife: "Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard's.)" You can do so through many index funds from many fund companies -- just be sure to choose one with low fees, as there are very low fees to be found. One great choice is the the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEMKT:SPY). It's an exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on the S&P 500 that works much like a stock, letting you buy as many or as few shares as you want throughout the trading day. It recently traded for about $218 per share, sported a dividend yield of about 2%, and charged just 0.1% in annual fees.

X State’s AIB share sale moves closer with advisory move Government to appoint investment banks to assist in future stock listing Thu, Nov 17, 2016, 16:30 Ciarán Hancock The selected groups will assist the State with early-stage preparations for an IPO of AIB shares. Photograph: Cyril Byrne         The Government has moved a step closer to the sale of AIB shares by preparing to appoint investment banks to assist in a future stock-market listing of shares. The Department of Finance has announced plans to run a tender among 12 investment banks and stockbrokers who are on an existing advisory panel. The capital markets panel comprises Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Citi, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Nomura, UBS and Irish stockbrokers Davy, Goodbody and Investec. The selected groups will assist the State with early-stage preparations for an initial public offering (IPO) and will be appointed for an 18-month period providing the State with “optionality” through 2017 and well into 2018. They will work on a no-foal-no-fee basis. This means they will not get paid unless a transaction occurs. If the Government decides to press the button on an IPO, a wider banking syndicate will be appointed to move preparations forward. The Government would be expected to sell at least 25 per cent of AIB initially, which could raise up to €3 billion based on the €12.2 billion valuation placed on the State’s holding in AIB at the end of last year. The proceeds would be used to repay some of the national debt. Weak markets The Government had originally intended to float AIB shares this year but scrapped this plan due to weak capital markets, particularly for bank stocks. A six-month build-up to an IPO would be expected, during which AIB would be required to prepare the extensive documentation necessary for a listing, and to conduct roadshows with potential institutional investors around the world. Commenting on the tender process, Minister for Finance Michael Noonan said: “My officials have commenced a competition process to procure joint global co-ordinators to enable a potential initial public offering of shares in AIB to the market. ADVERTISEMENT “While there is no fixed timetable for a sale at this time, given the long lead times involved in such a process this appointment is a necessary next step in order to provide the option to sell some of the State’s shareholding in AIB during 2017 or indeed early 2018.” “Such a sale is provided for in the programme for a partnership government and the ultimate decision will be subject to a range of factors including prevailing market conditions but the overriding consideration will be whether any transaction is likely to maximise the return for the State.” Strategic investment fund Separately, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) is set to re-evaluate the State’s holding in AIB as part of its annual accounting cycle. “As was the case in 2015, ISIF will procure its own independent valuation of the investments in AIB and Bank of Ireland and a provisional valuation will be included in their Q4 2016 performance and portfolio update early in the new year,” the department said. AIB is 99.9 per cent owned by the State, having received a €20.8 billion bailout from taxpayers. The bank made a pretax profit of €1.9 billion last year, of which roughly half was from underlying trading and the balance from provision writebacks.       Read More Date for IPO of AIB shares drifts further out of view Pension deficit swells to €6.8bn at top companies Bank stress tests: setback to AIB and Bank of Ireland Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Markets Goodbody warns of Trump’s ‘beggar thy neighbour’ plans Economy John FitzGerald: Long way to go in fight against climate change Irish News Gay Byrne to miss radio show over cancer concerns Gaelic Games Clare’s Ballyea clinch maiden Munster hurling title Sponsored Maia Dunphy: Let’s talk about fertility Designing the F-Pace: the story of Jaguar's best-seller HR managers need a simplified approach to pensions World-first tech restores mains electricity to Aran Islands ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Hammond says UK budget is constrained by high debt 17:31 Seen and Heard: Facebook secures payments services licence 16:59 Goodbody warns of Trump’s ‘beggar thy neighbour’ plans 16:48 Kingspan spends €35m on US acquisition 14:58 How to . . . help out your smartphone battery 14:00 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in Business 1 How to . . . help out your smartphone battery 2 Central Bank set to ease mortgage lending rules 3 Ireland’s biggest landlord: ‘I feel bad for the Irish people’ 4 Goodbody warns of Trump’s ‘beggar thy neighbour’ plans 5 Kingspan spends €35m on US acquisition 6 May’s changing vocabulary signals shift from ‘hard Brexit’ 7 Ireland could be facing even bigger recession, Martin warns 8 Workers take fight against ‘gig economy’ disrupters to court 9 Ires Reit: the facts behind Ireland’s biggest landlord 10 Donald Trump’s team reveals surprising lack of global business knowledge Never miss a story.

View Details When choosing the best card for your Black Friday shopping, there are a few important things to consider: 1. How Do You Want To Save? There are two main ways to save more money by using a credit card to pay for Black Friday shopping. The first is by earning rewards such as cash back, miles or points when you pay. Another way you can save is by getting a credit card with a low intro APR period on purchases. That way you can pay off your Black Friday purchases over a long period of time without having to worry about the APR. This saves you money because you can avoid the interest you would pay if you were to carry a balance on your regular credit card. Even if you have the cash to pay for your purchases, taking advantage of a long intro APR period for your purchases can help you save by letting you keep the bulk of your cash in interest-earning accounts or other investment channels. 2. Where Do You Shop? You might be one of those people who doesn't head to specific shops to catch deals, but just goes around picking the fruit. But then, you may be a dedicated customer at specific retailers. If you do your shopping at many different stores and types of retailers, then look for a card like Citi® Double Cash Card – 18 month BT offer, a partner card, or Chase Freedom Unlimited℠ that gives you a good amount of cash back on all eligible purchases rather than purchases in set categories. Department store shoppers should take advantage of cards that offer higher cash back at department stores. Some cards give you high cash back for supermarket shopping or Amazon.com purchases. If you shop at one or two stores only, then a store rewards card may work fine. But bear in mind that many store cards have high APRs, and don't necessarily give you more rewards than other more flexible rewards credit cards. You may also be limited in how you can redeem the rewards you earn, and might not actually save much money. 3. How Much Time Will You Need To Pay Off Your Black Friday Shopping There isn't any point missing out on great deals and then paying more for the same thing a month or two later. If you don't have handy cash to pay for the things on your shopping list, then paying off your purchases over time is a good solution. You will want to avoid most store installment payment plans, as these usually come with nasty strings attached and high interest. A much better idea is paying for those amazing deals using a credit card with an introductory low APR period. Good low interest cards will offer 0% intro APR on purchases for up to 21 months from the time you open your card account. That means if you open your new card account just ahead of Black Friday, you can pay off your purchases over a long period of time. Just bear in mind that once the card's intro APR period ends, you will have to pay the regular APR. So make sure to pay off your balance in full well ahead of the end-date. 4. What Type Of Rewards Do You Want? The most common rewards you earn with credit cards are points, cash back and miles. Points can be redeemed through a points program. Each points rewards program is different, and provides different options when you redeem your points. Depending on the rewards program you may be able to redeem your points for merchandise, experiences, travel, gift cards and even cash back. Some points rewards programs give you a lot of value when you redeem your points for a certain type of reward. For example, Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card lets you convert points to frequent travel programs at a 1:1 conversion rate. The main downside of points is that the value you get when redeeming points for merchandise, travel or gift cards is decided by the credit card company. So it can be a bit of a hit and miss setup. Cash back is a much less complicated type of credit card reward. Basically, you earn a certain percentage of what you spend on eligible purchases back. Some cards redeem your cash back automatically as a statement credit, check or deposit into your bank account. Other cash back cards let you choose how you redeem your cash back, and may let you redeem for gift cards, travel or merchandise in much the same way as points cards. The main benefit of cash back is that your rewards have a fixed value in cash. If you earn $100 of cash back, this will normally convert into $100. So you know exactly what you are getting with a cash back credit card. Miles credit cards let you earn miles for eligible purchases. Some cards such as United MileagePlus® Explorer Card let you earn actual frequent flyer miles. Other miles cards, including Discover it® Miles and Capital One® Venture® Rewards Credit Card, let you earn "miles" that you can redeem towards travel purchases at a miles to dollar rate. Using a miles credit card that lets you earn miles on all your purchases is one of the easiest ways to save on travel. 5. Online Or In Brick-And-Mortar Stores? Some credit cards let you earn extra rewards when you shop at big retailers through the card's deals program. Chase Freedom® lets you earn up to 15% extra cash back when you buy stuff using Shop Through Chase. Discover it® Cashback Match™ cardholders can use Discover Deals to earn extra cash back or score instant discounts when they shop deals online or in stores. Make sure to choose the card that suits your Black Friday shopping style. Remember that the card you use can mean the difference between getting up to 20% extra savings on stuff you buy and enjoying interest-free credit, or getting hammered with interest payments for the next year or more.

The dollar continued to appreciate against other currencies and reached its highest mark in 13 years. Banks took the biggest losses as a seven-day rally in that sector petered out. Industrial companies, also big gainers since the election, traded lower as well. The price of oil gave back some of its enormous gain from the day before. Graphics processor maker Nvidia and household names like Apple and Microsoft led technology companies higher. Rising stocks outnumbered decliners. The dollar has been very strong in recent years, just not this strong, and it’s been pretty stable compared to other currencies. But in the wake of the election, investors think the U.S. economy might grow a bit faster and inflation might pick up. “What’s pushed the dollar higher here in the short term is with the Trump win, particularly combined with (Republicans) holding on to the Senate,” said Scott Wren, a senior global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Still, Wren doesn’t think the dollar will rise much further. The Dow Jones industrial average slid 54.92 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,868.14. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 3.45 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,176.94. The Nasdaq composite picked up 18.96 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,294.58. After a long losing streak before the election, the Dow had risen for seven days in a row through Tuesday and set several all-time highs. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq have also made large gains and are near the records they set this fall. JPMorgan Chase led banks lower as it fell $1.96, or 2.5 percent, to $77.40 and Morgan Stanley lost 81 cents, or 2 percent, to $39.19. Banks are coming off their best single week since the financial crisis as investors hope for higher interest rates and more profits from lending, as well as cutbacks in regulations that could boost bank profits. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the dollar against six other currencies, rose to its highest level since April of 2003. The dollar is rising in part because investors think the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at a faster pace in response to inflation stemming from the increased spending that President-elect Donald Trump has proposed. A stronger dollar hurts U.S. companies that do a lot of business overseas because it makes their products more expensive, and it affects their earnings when they are translated from other currencies back into U.S. dollars. However it makes imported goods cheaper for consumers in the U.S. The dollar slipped 109.15 Japanese yen from 109.32 yen late Tuesday. The euro slid to $1.0681 from $1.0718. Technology companies moved upward as they continued a rally from a day earlier. Graphics processor maker Nvidia rose $5.44, or 6.3 percent, to $91.63 after it announced a collaboration with Microsoft, and Apple picked up $2.93, or 2.7 percent, to $110.04. Tech stocks had weakened since the election. Trump’s policies might affect their sales in China and other key markets, and a big surge this summer had brought some technology stocks to all-time highs. Retailer Target raised its profit forecast and its sales projections for the third quarter with the holiday season approaching. That came as the retailer gave a strong third-quarter report, as it put more emphasis on low prices after it stumbled in the second quarter. The stock gained $4.59, or 6.4 percent, to $76.03. TJX, the parent of TJ Maxx and Marshalls, reported a bigger profit and better sales than investors expected and its stock gained $2.90, or 3.9 percent, to $76.39. That helped lead consumer stocks higher. Home improvement retailer Lowe’s fell after it said traffic in stores was low during the third quarter, and Lowe’s reported a smaller third-quarter profit because of several big charges. Lowe’s lost $2.03, or 2.9 percent, to $67.02. Oil prices slipped. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 24 cents to $45.57 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, fell 32 cents to $46.63 a barrel in London. The price of U.S. crude oil soared Tuesday as investors hoped the oil-producing OPEC countries will agree to a production cut that would boost prices. Energy companies fell. They had rallied on Tuesday along with the price of crude oil. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped to 2.21 percent from 2.22 percent. Bond yields, which are used to set interest rates on many kinds of loans including mortgages, have risen to their highest levels since the beginning of the year as investors expect inflation to rise. Bond investors hate inflation because it erodes the value of the fixed interest payments that bonds pay. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline fell 2 cents to $1.32 a gallon.

Such factors include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold, copper or certain other commodities (such as silver, diesel fuel, natural gas and electricity); failure to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations; timing of receipt of, or failure to comply with, necessary permits and approvals; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development; changes in mineral production performance, exploitation and exploration successes; diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; increased costs, delays, suspensions and technical challenges associated with the construction of capital projects; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or development activities, including geotechnical challenges and disruptions in the maintenance or provision of required infrastructure and information technology systems; the impact of global liquidity and credit availability on the timing of cash flows and the values of assets and liabilities based on projected future cash flows; the impact of inflation; fluctuations in the currency markets; changes in U.S. dollar interest rates; changes in national and local government legislation, taxation, controls or regulations and/or changes in the administration of laws, policies and practices, expropriation or nationalization of property and political or economic developments in Argentina, Canada, the United States and other jurisdictions in which the company does or may carry on business in the future; lack of certainty with respect to foreign legal systems, corruption and other factors that are inconsistent with the rule of law; damage to the company's reputation due to the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, including negative publicity with respect to the company's handling of environmental matters or dealings with community groups, whether true or not; risk of loss due to acts of war, terrorism, sabotage and civil disturbances; litigation; contests over title to properties, particularly title to undeveloped properties, or over access to water, power and other required infrastructure; risks associated with working with partners in jointly controlled assets; employee relations including loss of key employees; increased costs and physical risks, including extreme weather events and resource shortages, related to climate change; and availability and increased costs associated with mining inputs and labor. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion, copper cathode or gold or copper concentrate losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks). Many of these uncertainties and contingencies can affect the company's actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the company or Barrick North America Finance LLC.

Ditto for the purple scarf for your sister.  Just as you’re deciding whether to splurge, a salesperson approaches with an offer that seems to come from the retail gods: Apply for an immediate store credit card and save 10 percent on today’s purchases. But take a breath, and read the fine print before deciding. And that goes for all the credit card offers stuffing your mailbox dangling a myriad of perks like airline miles, zero interest and cash back. Opening a new bonus-laden account during the holidays when some extra credit could make an extra-special holiday can be a good idea. Choosing wisely is key. Don’t buy that purse with the store card unless you can pay it off at the end of the month. That’s because store credit cards’ interest rates average about 23 percent, while a typical bank card rate averages 15 percent, according to Matt Schulz, a senior industry analyst at Creditcards.com. Play Video CBS Evening News The scary truth about store-branded credit cards A survey out Thursday says store credit cards can have interest rates twice as high as a regular bank card. Anna Werner has more on the cost of p... “That’s a significant difference, and the interest can override any discount if you can’t pay it off,” said Schulz. Still, some sign-up rewards can help brighten the holidays. The Chase Freedom Card offers a $150 cash back bonus to new holders who spend $500 over three months. “If you know you’re going to spend $500, get it -- and then you never have to use it again,” said Schulz. It’s important to consider what you buy and which dividends you’ll use when selecting a new card. An airline miles card may not make much sense now if the funds that you previously earmarked for exotic travel are now dedicated to a mortgage. What good is 5 percent cash back at gas stations if you don’t own a car? Creditcards.com has a tool to help you compare and select cards as does NerdWallet.com and ConsumerReports.org. The sites have information on annual card costs, interest rates and various perks.  You can find lots of options for no-fee cards, though don’t immediately dismiss the ones that require you to pay for privilege of stuffing the plastic rectangle in your wallet. The eye-popping $450 fee for the Chase Sapphire Reserve card may be a good deal if you’re a jetsetter. It comes with a $300 travel credit and $100 for the TSA Precheck program. Holders earn three points for every dollar spent on travel or dining, and you get a 100,000 point bonus for spending $4,000 in three months.  “You need to know how the card fits into your life,” said Schulz.   Zero interest rate cards that allow holders to pay back the cost of purchases over time without amassing fees can be especially tempting around the holidays. They help avoid what can be a nasty financial hangover in January and February. Schulz said to comparison-shop for post-grace-period interest rates. Be careful that the card doesn’t charge you interest going back to the date of purchase for the entire cost of the item even though some of it has been paid off. That’s more common with store cards than bank cards, however. Retailer Big Lots (BIG) offers its credit card holders who buy $250 worth of merchandise no interest for six months, a period that extends to a year if you charge $750 or more. But if you don’t pay it back on time, you’re hit with a 29.99 percent interest rate backdated to the time of purchase. That’s one big lump of coal. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.. All Rights Reserved.
