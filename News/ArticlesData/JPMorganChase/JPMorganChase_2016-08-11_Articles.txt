 TOP IPO BANKER: We have 'a pretty broad swath of deals ready for launch' Portia Crowe Aug. 8, 2016, 4:29 PM 3,806 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan's Liz Myers. Screenshot/Bloomberg TV It's been a slow year for the initial public offering, or IPO, market — but things could start to really pick up soon. That's what JPMorgan's global head of equity capital markets, Liz Myers, expects. She said in a recent Bloomberg TV interview that JPMorgan has more than 20 IPOs slated for launch globally in September, and a "full pipeline" for 2017. "It's a pretty broad swath of deals ready for launch," Myers said. She also noted that the firm expects to see more than a dozen tech IPOs before the end of the year. Those will mainly be smaller deals in software, Myers said, although we'll start to see larger tech IPOs in 2017 and 2018. In 2018, she added, we can expect to see activity in the virtual-reality, artificial-intelligence, and robotics spaces. She also said that Asia will see some larger IPOs toward the end of 2016 and into 2017. The largest tech IPO this year was the Japanese messaging app Line, which raised about $1 billion in its July debut on the Tokyo and New York stock exchanges. In addition to the tech sector, Myers said to expect more deals in the financial-services, healthcare, and consumer-retail sectors. She said that investors right now are not overly worried about the outcome of the US presidential election in November, nor are they overly cautious about the activities of the Federal Reserve. "Right now the reception [to IPOs] has been pretty good across a multitude of sectors," Myers said.

Singapore’s property companies and real estate investment trusts (Reits) have an unprecedented S$1.8 billion of local currency bonds maturing this quarter, S$1.2 billion in the final quarter and another S$3.7 billion next year. Credit Suisse Private Banking said it does not recommend the smaller developers due to “relatively high” leverage. JPMorgan Chase said these companies are the “most exposed” to a further property market correction given their weakening financial profiles. “Many bonds are unrated and investors aren’t adequately rewarded and have underpriced the risk,” said Mr Ben Sy, head of fixed income, currencies and commodities at the private banking arm of JPMorgan in Hong Kong. The finances of the smaller developers in Singapore are weakening and leverage is rising in a market that lacks sufficient scrutiny, he added. Home values in Singapore have dropped 9.4 per cent from the peak in 2013 and the declines show no signs of abating. The Urban Redevelopment Authority index tracking private home prices fell for the 11th quarter in the three months ended June 30 and the Government on Thursday cut its 2016 economic growth forecasts amid global uncertainties. The smallest 50 real estate firms and trusts listed on the Singapore Exchange are in a weaker position to repay debt, with operating earnings dropping to 9.2 times interest expenses from 15.8 times five years ago. Investors are now demanding bigger premiums to hold notes from the smaller borrowers. Heeton Holdings, which builds homes along Holland Road, has seen the yield on its 2017 bonds rise about 130 basis points from a year ago to 6.54 per cent, according to Bloomberg data. The firm has total debt of S$369.2 million and cash and equivalents of S$11.2 million as of June 30, according to company filings. The yield on the 2017 securities of Aspial Corp, a developer of high-rise condos more known for its jewellery retail business, has jumped to about 9.8 per cent, according to Bloomberg data. Credit Suisse Private Bank prefers Reits, whose borrowing levels are capped by regulators at 45 per cent of total assets. “We prefer Reits where the leverage is lower and cash flows are more stable,” said Mr Neel Gopalakrishnan, the firm’s Singapore-based emerging markets fixed-income analyst. However, not all trusts have escaped unscathed from the downturn, as demand for leasing properties has weakened and some have taken on more debt for acquisitions. Moody’s Investors Service changed its outlook on Singapore-listed Suntec Real Estate Investment Trust to negative on Tuesday after it proposed to buy a stake in a Melbourne property and fund the acquisition with debt. The ratings firm said that Singapore Reits have been making debt-funded acquisitions and while the ones with strong sponsors have access to banking relationships, smaller trusts may face challenges refinancing. “All of them have become a lot more aggressive in terms of acquisitions over the past 12 to 24 months,” said Ms Rachel Chua, a Singapore-based analyst at Moody’s.

 The tech IPO window could be opening — here's what to expect in September Portia Crowe Aug. 12, 2016, 11:08 AM 11,359 facebook linkedin twitter email print The art installation "Alice" by Spanish artist Cristina Lucas. REUTERS/Marcelo del Pozo The tech IPO market is primed for a resurgence in September — after a historically sluggish start to the year. At least three tech startups that have filed for initial public offerings confidentially could make their intentions public as early as the week of August 22, according to people familiar with the matter. Those include the software-as-a-service company Apptio, the cybersecurity-software company Carbon Black, and the software company Coupa. Apptio, which is based in Bellevue, Washington, and develops business management applications, was reportedly planning for an IPO more than a year ago but has yet to make a filing public. It hired Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch last July, according to The Wall Street Journal. Carbon Black, formerly known as Bit9, is based in Waltham, Massachusetts, and develops endpoint security software. The startup, which is backed by Sequoia Capital and Blackstone, hired Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan to lead an IPO, Bloomberg reported in June. Coupa is a cloud-based software company based in San Mateo, California, that helps companies manage their finances. Reuters in July reported that it had hired Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Barclays, and Royal Bank of Canada for an IPO. All three are likely contenders for the post-Labor Day window — a natural time for dealmaking to pick up after a late summer slump — although that's not a guarantee they'll hit the road then. Even thought the Nasdaq Composite index is at a record, any turbulence in the market could discourage issuers. At the moment, though, IPO investors are indicated they'll be receptive to new listings, one of the people said, in part because of the scarcity of such deals this year. Mutual funds that invest in IPOs, for example, are looking for opportunities to bolster their returns before the end of the year. And although there have only been six tech IPOs this year, those that did approach the market performed well. NYSE president Tom Farley, right, congratulates Line executives after ringing the opening bell. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid The cloud-communications company Twilio, for example, priced above range in June and continued to soar for days. The Japanese messaging app Line priced above its range in July, jumped 27% on its first day of trading, and continues to hover. Strong tech IPO performance has also piqued the interest of momentum investors, or hedge funds that might be looking to play IPOs as an asset class by betting on the kinds of short-term gains that Twilio and Line posted. In short, bankers are advising companies that are in a position to launch to consider doing so, the person said. Other deals that could go in the fall include the enterprise-storage company Nutanix, which has been on file publicly since late 2015, and the application-intelligence software company AppDynamics, which has not yet filed publicly but is a likely contender for the fourth quarter, the people said. Most tech IPOs that are likely to go this year — including Apptio, Carbon Black, and Coupa — have revenues under $1 billion, allowing them to file confidentially with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS, Act. Companies that file confidentially must make their documents public 15 business days before holding a roadshow — which is why any tech startups looking to launch right after Labor Day could file publicly by the week of August 22. Of course, not every company that files will necessarily end up launching its deal. Recently, a number of startups planning to go public have ended up being bought instead. Those include the security-software company Blue Coat Systems and the Canadian auto marketplace Trader. And a failed deal from a company that tries to price its shares too aggressively would slam that window shut. Apptio and Carbon Black declined to comment for this story. Coupa could not immediately be reached for comment.

Yes It's A Thing Investors Have Cast Their Ballots For Big Bank Stocks Disrupting Disruptors Like IEX: What Every Oligopoly Needs To Know (Seeking Alpha) The investment unit of JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE: JPM) said it will liquidate one of its Japan-focused funds due to a large string of client withdrawals and poor performances over the years. According to Bloomberg, JPMorgan's Japan Market Neutral Fund was launched in June 2011, but will now close after its total assets fell to around $17 million - below the $30 million liquidation threshold. The fund has seen what the company described as "significant redemption" over the past few months - a move that may not necessarily be surprising as the fun has lost a cumulative 16 percent since inception. Investor appetite for Japanese assets has been impacted by uncertainty over the direction of the country's central banking policies and what impact negative interest rates will have on local assets. Bloomberg obtained a letter from the fund's managers which explained the closure. It noted a "limited prospect of attracting new subscriptions." Meanwhile, other Japan focused funds have seen similar outflows. Bloomberg noted that WisdomTree Investments has seen $4.6 billion worth of redemption in its Japan Hedged Equity Fund. In fact, investors pulled out $974 million from Japan-focused hedge funds in the first quarter of 2016, representing a rate of redemption six times more than what was seen in the same quarter a year ago.

Investor demand for higher returns has eclipsed a drop in oil prices and pushed the ruble’s correlation with crude to the lowest in a year. The currency of the world’s biggest energy exporter has turned from one of 2015’s five worst emerging-market performers to the third-best this year. Russia’s economy shrank 0.6 percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, the least since a contraction began at the start of 2015. The future’s looking brighter, too, with options traders the least pessimistic on the ruble’s long-term prospects since mid-2014. Years of easy-money policies in developed economies have pushed yields below zero from Japan to Europe -- in stark contrast to Russia, whose 10.5 percent main rate makes it a popular destination for money borrowed cheaply elsewhere. “The ruble is going to be one of the outperformers in the emerging markets,” said Saad Siddiqui, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., which topped Bloomberg’s latest currency rankings for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. “It offers one of the best carry trades.” JPMorgan is predicting a 5 percent gain in the ruble to 61.36 per dollar by year-end, from 64.72 in Moscow on Friday. That contrasts with the 1 percent drop forecast in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Record Low The ruble has rallied 14 percent this year, the best performance in emerging markets after the Brazilian real and the South African rand. That’s a turnaround from January, when collapsing crude prices pushed the currency to an all-time low of 85.999 per dollar. Start your day with what’s moving markets.

You will now receive the Technology newsletter The global rush to lock in yields helped the ruble buck a fresh bout of oil weakness this quarter. While Brent dropped 7 percent since June, the ruble is almost 1 percent stronger and carry traders have taken home a 21 percent return this year, the second-best after the real among 23 developing-nation peers. The ruble’s 30-day correlation with oil has fallen to 0.5, the lowest since June 2015, from as much as 0.9 in October. A reading of one would mean the two assets were in lockstep. “Russia still has relatively attractive real interest rates vis à vis other investment destinations and the oil price is volatile, but on a small scale,” said Sergey Dergachev, a senior money manager at Union Investment Privatfonds GmbH in Frankfurt, which oversees about $13 billion. "The carry trade is really supportive for the ruble and other higher yielding currencies." August Calamities At the same time, Dergachev said the ruble still remains susceptible to risks including the flare-up in hostilities in Ukraine. The currency has only gained against the dollar in August on three occasions since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the month has come to be associated with Russian catastrophes as well as the summer doldrums. In August 1998 Boris Yeltsin’s government defaulted on its local debt and the currency collapsed almost 40 percent; August 2004 saw a spate of terror attacks culminating in the Beslan hostage-taking on Sept. 1; the Kursk nuclear submarine sank in August 2000, days after a fatal bomb blast in a Moscow underpass. While options prices suggest traders are still more pessimistic on the ruble than any other emerging-market currency apart from the Turkish lira and South African rand, they’re rapidly shedding their pessimism. The premium on contracts to sell the ruble versus the dollar in a year’s time, compared with options to buy, narrowed to 4.1 percentage points this week, the least since July 2014, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s down from more than 17 percentage points in January, when the ruble slumped to a record. “In the current global environment with yields at a record low in developed economies, investors are looking for opportunities in the EM universe,” said Piotr Matys, a strategist at Rabobank in London. “High yielders are at the top of their list.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Brookings previously issued a brief response to the article. Here we present our point-by-point response. The Brookings Institution is a public policy research organization committed to seeking solutions to problems facing society. Our core mission is to serve the public good. In order to fulfill that task and generate solutions that have impact, we often work with diverse segments of society that have a stake in its welfare — government, academe, philanthropies, civic leaders, and the private sector. Given our overarching goal of improving the governance of communities at all levels, we are all the more conscious of our obligation to improve our own governance, including the terms of our relationships with donors. To that end, we welcome engagement with the media and other consumers of our products, including when they have constructive criticisms and suggestions. In responding to feedback, we strive to meet the highest standards of transparency and accountability. It is in this spirit that on behalf of Brookings, I am responding to the New York Times (NYT) articles from earlier this week (“Researchers or Corporate Allies?” on August 7, 2016 and “Think Tank Scholar or Corporate Consultant?” on August 8, 2016) that questioned the integrity of our work funded by corporations. While the reporters raised some valid questions, the overall picture they draw is tendentious. In the detailed response to the articles below, we deal with both aspects of the Times coverage. Author Strobe Talbott President, The Brookings Institution Twitter strobetalbott Public policy research and journalism have in common some core principles, including a commitment to objectivity, a respect for facts, and an open mind. The two articles do not reflect those principles. The reporters spent more than seven months on the story, poring over a massive volume of internal documentation (most that they obtained on their own, some that Brookings provided), and our senior management spent many hours cooperating with their inquiry. The reporters are, of course, entitled to their opinions. But they had clearly made up their minds about conflicts of interest between think tanks and the corporate world before they sought our views and responses. In the interviews and in the resulting articles, it was apparent that the reporters were determined to bend their story to support a misguided accusation that Brookings, along with similar organizations, is promoting corporate, commercial interests rather than furthering the public good. They disregarded or slanted evidence that did not conform to this preconceived conclusion. That is the opposite of objectivity. The reporters could have shed constructive light on an important challenge of the day: donor relations in all non-profit sectors — from think tanks and universities to arts, social service, and humanitarian organizations – have become increasingly complicated in an era of largely restricted grant-making. As we noted in an article published in February by the Chronicle of Philanthropy, “today’s philanthropic environment calls for a new, forceful agreement between donors and non-profits that clarifies and fortifies the boundary of the no-go zone.” The headline of the first Times article asserts that think tanks are “blurring the line” between business and research, thereby contaminating the latter. In our discussions and correspondence with the Times, we demonstrated to the reporters a clear line does exist — namely, the distinction between a corporate donor’s business interests in a community (i.e., its for-profit activities) and its societal interests (i.e., its commitment to use its influence and its investments to advance the social, civic, economic, environmental, and cultural interests of the community as a whole). The former is entirely a corporate undertaking, in which Brookings has neither interest nor expertise, while the latter is exactly where we contribute – individually and, more importantly, as a catalyst that brings diverse sectors together into networks of stakeholders who share a commitment to improving their communities. All stakeholders have interests – or what the reporters referred to as “agendas.” Our interest is to gather the facts, listen to knowledgeable parties, analyze the situation, and try to come up with solutions that benefit the community as a whole. The Times, both in its interviews with us and in its articles, not only rejected this distinction — it dismissed our view of its importance. Again, the reporters are free to take issue with our understanding of our own work. But it is hard to see how their long and detailed articles can avoid addressing a fundamental precept of the institution they are reporting on. Another commonality between journalism and public policy research is independence. It is at the core of both professions’ reputation for quality and integrity, which, of course, go hand in hand. Our donors and the public, including the reporters and columnists who turn to us for help in their work, expect us to meet our own standard. With that obligation always in mind, we have instituted strong policies that are regularly reviewed and updated as we strive to ensure transparency, accountability, and the avoidance of conflicts of interest. Given the complicated world in which we live and the breadth of policy challenges to address, we do not claim a perfect record. As we acknowledged to the lead reporter, there have been instances when we should have done better. Indeed, in the cases the Times identified, we had already taken corrective measures—including updating our policies and procedures—by the time he came to see us. The articles presented these anomalous missteps as examples of standard practice. All of us at the Brookings Institution, along with many of our colleagues in similar organizations, not only expect public scrutiny, we regard it as an important check on what we do, how we do it, and how our work is perceived. Think tanks, along with the news industry, are going through a period of disruptive change in the political, economic, and social environment — as well as, in our case, the philanthropic one. As we adjust to these new realities and complexities, we do our best to be at our best. And when we fall short, we try hard to fix the problem and apply the lessons moving forward. In light of the values we share, we hope that the Times and its readers will take seriously our side of what we regard as their flawed story. Brookings maintains strict policies to ensure the independence of our research. The NYT cherry-picked and misrepresented views of independent legal experts who contradicted their claims. The NYT misrepresented the facts about branding Brookings’s Global Cities Initiative (GCI). The NYT presented a misstep as if it were standard procedure. The NYT is wrong: The Metropolitan Policy Program (Metro) never received funding from SunStreet Energy. Brookings implemented new conflict of interest policies in 2015. Brookings does not lobby or request meetings with government officials on behalf of donors. Brookings’s scholars—not donors—always have the final say in their analysis, judgment and recommendations. Brookings’s policies require disclosure of donors who participate in its events. The NYT is wrong in its insinuation that Brookings appointed a lobbyist to cultivate corporations. Brookings Metro serves as a bridge between stakeholders not as a promoter of corporate investments. Brookings did not promote Hitachi’s interests. The NYT misconstrued the goals of the Global Cities Initiative; Brookings did not promote JPMorgan Chase’s business lines. The NYT reporters cherry-picked sentences from draft documents and failed to report the strict guidelines for promoting the Global Cities Initiative. Brookings has developed strict rules on disclosure of potential scholar conflicts of interest. 1. Brookings maintains strict policies to ensure the independence of our research. NYT ALLEGATION: “…in the chase for funds, think tanks are pushing agendas important to corporate donors, at times blurring the line between researchers and lobbyists. And they are doing so while reaping the benefits of their tax-exempt status, sometimes without disclosing their connections to corporate interests. Brookings responds: Over its one-hundred-year history, Brookings has sought to build a reputation for independent, in-depth, policy-relevant research. Brookings does not lobby Congress. It does seek to advance the public good by improving governance through advising policy-makers and informing the public. All Brookings scholars, exercising their right to academic freedom, decide which policy issues they will research and how they will contribute to the public policy debate. Corporations and other donors do not determine what the scholars study, which scholars conduct the research, what methodology is employed, or what conclusions are reached. To ensure that the independence of Brookings’s research is preserved, the Institution has developed strict policies, which it regularly updates to deal with a changing and competitive funding environment. Those policies include a requirement for full transparency of the sources of all donations, which can be found in the annual report and on the Brookings website. Brookings has five research programs that cover the breadth of policy issues, both domestic and foreign. The New York Times reporters, Mr. Lipton and Ms. Williams, chose to focus on the Metropolitan Policy Program (Metro) because they managed to obtain thousands of pages of its internal documents. For two decades Metro scholars have worked at the local level to provide a public good in urban areas: helping these communities improve infrastructure, economic growth, innovation, and job-generation. To maximize the impact of its data-driven research, Metro works with all stakeholders, including local governments, community leaders, media, academe, NGOs, and philanthropies. Corporations are a vital component of that network because of their ability to invest in local communities and create jobs. Back to top 2. The NYT cherry-picked and misrepresented views of independent legal experts who contradicted their claims. NYT ALLEGATION: “Donations from the corporations to Brookings are tax exempt based on the premise that the think tank’s work benefits the public good, not a company’s bottom line. But two lawyers who specialize in nonprofit law — Miranda Perry Fleischer, a professor at the University of San Diego School of Law, and Clifford Perlman, a partner at a New York-based firm — said Brookings’s agreements raised questions. ‘Tax deductions are subsidies that are paid for by all taxpayers,’ Ms. Fleischer said. ‘And the reason the subsidy is provided is that the charitable organization is supposed to be doing something for the public good, not that specifically benefits the private individual or corporation in the form of providing them goods or services.’” Brookings responds: Brookings, like every other public charity, ranging from museums to colleges to orchestras, is responsible for ensuring that it accepts and spends the grants, donations, and contributions it receives in a manner consistent with the law, its charitable purpose and mission and, in the case of grants, the donor’s intent. This is consistent with Brookings’s overall mission of serving the public good. Brookings does not engage in fee-for-service consultancy, and produces no proprietary research. Unlike a fee-for-service arrangement, all of its research products are made publicly available. This is evidenced by the corpus of our work itself, which consists of hundreds of thousands of pages of articles, books, papers, reports, and data, almost all of which is made freely available on our website to anyone who chooses to use it. The Metro program in particular provides an important public good, evidenced by the results on the ground in the communities where the program has had a demonstrable positive impact in terms of helping cities grow, innovate and generate jobs. In the process of reporting this story, Mr. Lipton alleged that Brookings had engaged in tax improprieties. Brookings takes its obligations as a non-profit, charitable organization very seriously, and to make sure that Brookings had not acted improperly, we engaged a leading nonprofit tax specialist, Douglas Varley of Caplin and Drysdale, LLP, a prominent tax law firm that had no previous relationship with Brookings. In their published report, Mr. Lipton and Ms. Williams present Mr. Varley as “one of our lawyers,” failing to mention the fact that he was an outside expert with no previous association with Brookings, something which we repeatedly emphasized to Mr. Lipton. After reviewing the documents provided by the New York Times, as well as interviewing key Brookings personnel, Mr. Varley and his colleague Sharon P. Want concluded: Based on our review and the analysis presented below, it is our opinion that, given the applicable legal standards, Brookings has reported the payments from Hitachi, JPMorgan Chase and Lennar appropriately on its Form 990. Despite the fact that it was provided to them on several occasions, Mr. Lipton and Ms. Williams chose to cherry pick from Mr. Varley’s judgement and avoided quoting that sentence in their piece, presumably because it would have put to rest the “questions” that their legal experts claimed their reporting raised about Brookings’s tax status. Nor did they interview Mr. Varley, which could have clarified any questions about his relationship with Brookings. Further, because Mr. Lipton made the same charge about our relationships with KKR and Microsoft, we asked our external auditors, RSM, a leading auditing and tax consultant, to examine those relationships in particular. They concluded: After review of the contents of the Form 990, its instructions and other regulatory guidance, we are confident that The Brookings Institution’s Form 990 has been prepared and presented fairly in all material respects pursuant to those instructions and regulatory guidance. We furnished this judgment to Mr. Lipton but he chose not to refer to it in his story. Finally, we checked with Mr. Perlman, one of the two lawyers Mr. Lipton and Ms. Williams rely on for the claim that Brookings’s agreements “raised questions.” He told us that the article mischaracterizes the overall tone and conclusions of their conversations. Mr. Perlman does not recall which Brookings documents he reviewed and does not believe he used the word “questionable” to describe them. RT Rybak, Former Executive Director, GenerationNext, President and CEO, Minneapolis Foundation: “Years before most communities were focused on attacking economic disparities in our cities, Brookings’s Metropolitan Policy Program helped Minneapolis-St.Paul (MSP) understand the depth of our problem and how to attack it. Because of Brookings’ clear-eyed analysis and guidance, we built a consensus among leaders that our Number 1 civic goal should be closing economic, academic, and racial gaps. Today I work to close our region’s opportunity gaps for children of color, in large part, because Brooking’s Metropolitan Policy Program first showed me there is no greater issue for Minneapolis-St.Paul.” Back to top 3. The NYT misrepresented the facts about branding Brookings’s Global Cities Initiative (GCI). NYT ALLEGATION: “…think tanks have frequently become vehicles for corporate influence and branding campaigns… The think tanks also help donors promote their corporate brands, as Brookings does with JPMorgan Chase….” Brookings responds: Brookings maintains strict policies to ensure the independence of its research – both in how it is conducted and how it is shared publicly. Brookings prohibits the use of corporate logos at its events, specifically to avoid the appearance that we are advertising for corporate sponsors. Mr. Lipton and Ms. Williams cite the Global Cities Initiative (GCI), a joint project between Brookings and JPMorgan Chase, as an example of Brookings promoting the JPMorgan Chase brand. On the contrary, Brookings was promoting the Global Cities Initiative, a branded effort, which Mr. Lipton and Ms. Williams consistently and incorrectly conflated with promoting JPMorgan Chase. In fact, as we explained to Mr. Lipton, the only logo used at GCI events is the one designed for the Global Cities Initiative itself – it is not the JPMorgan Chase logo (see photo). Nevertheless, we highlight the relationship with JPMorgan Chase in related materials precisely to make clear its role as the donor. Back to top 4. The NYT presented a misstep as if it were standard procedure. NYT ALLEGATION: “Brookings, as it sought an additional $50,000 from Lennar in 2014, said it was prepared to ‘use our convening power, research expertise, network connections and knowledge of innovative practices to help further drive the ultimate impact and success’ of Lennar’s project and to ‘provide public validation of San Francisco’s efforts through national and local media coverage…. Lennar joined Brookings’s Metropolitan Leadership Council, established for the program’s top donors, in July 2010. That month, the company won approval to redevelop Hunters Point in San Francisco, turning the area into a more than 700-acre mix of housing, education and commercial development. Brookings would later name the project one of the three most ‘transformative investments in the United States.’” Brookings responds: Brookings’s relationship with Lennar is governed by the Institution’s donor policies, which are designed to ensure quality and independence. In reviewing the record, Brookings acknowledged to Mr. Lipton that some language in the final memorandum of understanding with Lennar in January 2014 was inappropriate since it gave the impression that Brookings scholars were providing public validation of the project in return for receiving funding for their work. In this instance, Brookings chose to feature the Hunters Point Shipyard project due to its merits, as part of a broader strategy to identify and publicly validate the best practices of innovation districts. The project is one of the largest urban regeneration projects in the United States and its practices were judged to be highly relevant to similar revitalization efforts underway elsewhere. This project reflects key attributes, such as a strong focus on affordable housing and social equity, critical to emerging trends in innovation districts. Brookings is not alone in this assessment. The Hunters Point Shipyard Project enjoys strong support from federal, state, and local governments and has been recognized by regional and national organizations for the quality of its design and scale of its ambitions.1 And Lennar had already established its reputation for innovation – on community benefit agreements2, affordable housing commitments3, and mixed use design – before it provided funding to Brookings. Brookings highlighted the Hunters Point Shipyard at a 2011 private conference on how to support the development of large-scale infrastructure projects (e.g., transformative investments) in the absence of federal action. Brookings sought applications from dozens of cities for case studies to feature. The City and County of San Francisco, the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency, and Lennar submitted an application on Hunters Point. The project was assessed along with a large number of other projects submitted in response to the Brookings request, which was sent to a broad network of public, private, and nonprofit organizations. Brookings scholars selected the Hunters Point project and two others to highlight at the conference because each offered valuable lessons for other projects around the country. In retrospect, the fact that Lennar was a donor to Brookings created a perception of a conflict of interest. In this case, Brookings scholars should have found some independent method for validating their selections. Nevertheless, we believe that by objective standards, the Hunters Point Shipyard Project merited the attention it was given. Despite Mr. Lipton’s and Ms. Williams’ claims, Bruce Katz and other Brookings scholars did not make appearances alongside Mr. Bonner, Lennar’s President, for the purposes of promoting the project to government officials and business leaders, or otherwise improperly help Lennar promote the Hunters Point Shipyard Project. Nor has Brookings ever arranged meetings with government officials for Lennar. Forecast SF and other events at which Brookings scholars appeared alongside Lennar executives were public events at which Brookings scholars discussed their innovation districts research. In San Francisco in particular, it would be impossible to have a discussion on innovation districts and not reference Hunters Point, one of the largest innovation district redevelopment projects in the world. Again, to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest, the funding relationship between Lennar and Brookings should have been disclosed, as Brookings policies now require. Metro scholars regularly speak about innovative projects that offer the best real-world solutions, whether any of its donors are involved or not. For example, Brookings has praised Chattanooga’s downtown innovation district4, commending it for its strong culture of collaboration and well-executed place-making efforts. Brookings does not receive funds from any source in Chattanooga. MIPIM (Marché International des Professionnels d’Immobilier), the international real estate conference in Cannes that the reporters reference, presented an opportunity to share Brookings’s innovation districts research with relevant stakeholders, city leaders, and developers from around the world. A Brookings scholar presented our innovation districts research on a panel during which Brookings’s funding relationship with Lennar was clearly disclosed, in accordance with the Institution’s strict disclosure rules. Because we believe in the need to avoid even the perception of a conflict of interest and the need for greater oversight, Brookings updated its policies and vetting procedures in 2015, before Mr. Lipton showed us the internal documents he had obtained. Andy Berke, Mayor of Chattanooga: “In early 2015, Chattanooga leveraged our Gigabit infrastructure, strong public/private partnerships, and a thriving startup community to establish the first Innovation District in a mid-sized city. Not only were research and visits from Brookings instrumental in the creation of our Innovation District, their continued collaboration will help us maximize our strengths as the District continues to grow. The Brookings Institution has the research to help cities create the right conditions to grow talent, generate jobs, and drive economic activity, and their expertise is pivotal for any city looking to compete in the new innovation economy.” Back to top 5. The NYT is wrong: The Metropolitan Policy Program (Metro) never received funding from SunStreet Energy. NYT ALLEGATION: “At least some of the $400,000 Lennar has donated to Brookings since 2010 has come from its SunStreet Energy division, which sells rooftop solar systems, at the same time that Brookings’s metropolitan program has published research on the rooftop solar industry.” Brookings responds: The Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program (Metro) never received funding from SunStreet Energy. The company’s only gift to Brookings was made in January 2016 as a $50,000 general support gift to the Governance Studies program. The Metro scholars who have worked on rooftop solar issues have no relationship—funding or otherwise—with SunStreet Energy, derived no benefit from the contribution, and were unaware of its existence in a different program at Brookings. Back to top 6. Brookings implemented new conflict of interest policies in 2015. NYT ALLEGATION: “And Brookings went further. It named Kofi Bonner, the Lennar executive in charge of the San Francisco development, as a senior fellow — an enviable credential he used to advance the company’s efforts. ‘He would be a trusted adviser,’ an internal Brookings memo said in 2014 as the think tank sought one $100,000 donation from Lennar.” Brookings responds: Kofi Bonner served as a Non-Resident Senior Fellow at Brookings. That one-year appointment was not renewed due to concerns about an appearance of a conflict of interest. Mr. Lipton and Ms. Williams incorrectly identified Kofi Bonner as a “Senior Fellow” – a designation used for full-time scholars at the Institution. Bonner was appointed as a Non-Resident Senior Fellow, so that Brookings could draw upon his expertise and trusted advice to inform Brookings’s evolving work on innovation districts, especially in areas where the Hunters Point Shipyard was charting new ground. Our research programs regularly establish affiliations with outside experts who have specialized knowledge and experience, often appointing them as non-resident affiliates because of their substantive expertise and ongoing involvement with a particular research project. These experts are drawn from academia, other think tanks, the non-profit sector, and the for-profit sector. Kofi Bonner is a nationally-respected urban developer with masters’ degrees in urban planning and architecture from the University of California Berkeley and experience as a senior official in the city governments of Oakland and San Francisco. He was eminently qualified to be appointed as a Non-Resident Senior Fellow5 and did not need a title or a platform at Brookings to be a credible voice on these subjects. Importantly, Mr. Lipton and Ms. Williams did not produce any evidence to indicate that Mr. Bonner used his platform at Brookings to advance the interests of Lennar. He appeared as an expert panelist at a single Brookings event on June 9, 2014, for the launch of The Rise of Innovation Districts white paper. Bruce Katz communicated Lennar’s financial support at that event, along with the other donors to Metro’s Innovation Districts Initiative.6 Nearly a year ago, Brookings recognized that non-resident affiliates who are engaged in other paid activities posed a particular challenge for the maintenance of the Institution’s standard of independence. Brookings established a Conflicts of Interest Committee that developed and promulgated additional rules in late 2015 for non-resident scholars designed to avoid any conflict of interest or the appearance of a conflict of interest. This ongoing process of self-examination and scrutiny is led by Brookings senior management in recognition of its importance to the Institution’s reputation. Back to top 7. Brookings does not lobby or request meetings with government officials on behalf of donors. NYT ALLEGATION: “Thousands of pages of internal memos and confidential correspondence between Brookings and other donors — like JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s largest bank; K.K.R., the global investment firm; Microsoft, the software giant; and Hitachi, the Japanese conglomerate — show that financial support often came with assurances from Brookings that it would provide ‘donation benefits,’ including setting up events featuring corporate executives with government officials, according to documents obtained by the New York Times.” Brookings responds: As an important part of its contribution to the public policy debate, Brookings convenes hundreds of events a year, where its scholars are joined by outside experts, including government officials and individuals from the private sector, to discuss their ideas and share their expertise and experience with a wider audience. These events are designed to be public education forums, usually with broad audiences from inside and outside the policy-making community. Like many members of the general public, donors are routinely invited to these events. However, Brookings’s rules prohibit any donor from using such events to promote its brands or products. It is important to note that Brookings does not lobby or request meetings with government officials on behalf of donors. Engagement of Brookings scholars with government officials is explicitly for the purpose of informing their understanding of policy so that they can pursue the shared objective of improving governance. During meetings with government officials, Brookings scholars share data, non-partisan research and analysis, information, and ideas, but are prohibited from endorsing or advocating for any specific legislation. Nonprofit and charitable organizations in the United States routinely provide “donor benefits,” often listing them in brochures designed to attract funding (e.g. universities offer access to tickets or exclusive events, museums provide preferential treatment to members, giving them special access to exhibitions). The benefits Brookings offers its donors are no different. They do not constitute a “fee-for-service” arrangement and therefore have no impact on the independence of the scholars’ research, which are all made available to the public. Mr. Lipton and Ms. Williams provide no evidence to the contrary. Back to top 8. Brookings’s scholars—not donors—always have the final say in their analysis, judgment and recommendations. NYT ALLEGATION: “The likely conclusions of some think tank reports, documents show, are discussed with donors — or even potential ones — before the research is complete. Drafts of the studies have been shared with donors whose opinions have then helped shape final reports.” Brookings responds: Brookings scholars do not share their research drafts with donors in order to help corporate lobbying efforts. Moreover, all gift agreements signed by the Brookings Institution have clear and robust language protecting the independence of our scholars, regardless of the desire of the donor. As can be seen in the documents the New York Times has posted, Brookings uses the following language in gift agreements with donors: Brookings scholars, in conformity with the Institution’s mission of developing independent, nonpartisan analysis and recommendations that reflect objective and rigorous scholarship, will make the final determinations regarding the scholarly activities supported by [the gift/grant], including the research agenda, content, product, outcomes, use and distribution of resulting publications, and selection of personnel associated with the projects supported by [the gift/grant]. Brookings scholars and staff will at no time lobby or otherwise promote the interests of any donor. In the course of their research, Brookings scholars engage with a broad range of people with specific expertise in the areas they are researching, including stakeholders, policy makers, other scholars and, in some cases, donors. Brookings’s scholars always have the final say in what is published, in terms of their analysis, judgment and recommendations. Mr. Lipton and Ms. Williams produce no evidence that their sweeping allegation applied to any of Brookings’s work. Back to top 9. Brookings’s policies require disclosure of donors who participate in its events. NYT ALLEGATION: “The files included company priorities and a tally of donations. General Electric wanted to fund work on rail networks and clean energy programs — both critical parts of its business — and Brookings then featured G.E. executives, joined by officials from the White House and Congress, at events that focused on these industries.” Brookings responds: For many years, the Metro Program has conducted research on sustainable growth, transportation infrastructure, and the clean economy. General Electric supported this independent research, along with the Nathan Cummings Foundation, Living Cities, Inc., and the Surdna Foundation. Brookings will occasionally invite corporate experts to appear on panels, as long as their relationship to Brookings, if any, is disclosed at the event. In July 2011, because of his expertise, a G.E. official appeared on a panel at the public release of Metro’s report, Sizing the Clean Economy. General Electric’s funding relationship was clearly disclosed at that event.7 The official’s participation reflected Brookings scholars’ view of the critical role the private sector needs to play in advancing the transition to a clean economy. As noted earlier, Brookings’s policies and procedures requiring the disclosure of donors at events have become even stricter since 2011. Angela Blanchard, President and CEO, Neighborhood Centers Inc.: “Working with Brookings was a critical experience for our organization. Their questions were hard and their examination of our story in a greater context was rigorous. We were working in our own region and getting results in our efforts to welcome new immigrants and transform troubled neighborhoods, but Brookings made us consider success in a larger context. We spent a year answering their questions and came away with a new and broader understanding of what works here and why. This understanding has shaped our decisions about where to go next. We have clarity that makes us focused and formidable.” Back to top 10. The NYT is wrong in its insinuation that Brookings appointed a lobbyist to cultivate corporations. NYT ALLEGATION: “In 2004, Brookings established its Metropolitan Policy Program, devised to stimulate economic growth in cities. As the country was emerging from recession, Brookings bolstered its ties to corporate donors in 2010 by naming Marek Gootman, a lobbyist from Patton Boggs, as its first director of strategic partnerships. He was assigned to work with ‘a national network of elected, business and civic leaders engaged in city and metropolitan area policy development and implementation.’” Brookings responds: Mr. Lipton and Ms. Williams are simply wrong in their assertion that Brookings Metro Program created a new position to bolster ties to corporate donors. The strategic partnerships position was specifically created to help build its network of public, civic, and private leaders in cities. This appointee is not a lobbyist. Mr. Lipton and Ms. Williams take what is an entirely legitimate engagement with the private sector and imply that Brookings is serving the business interests of corporate donors or somehow lobbying on their behalf because of the previous employment history of one of its employees. This provides a good example of the way the reporters use innuendo—in this case guilt by association—to promote their predetermined agenda. Back to top 11. Brookings Metro serves as a bridge between stakeholders not as a promoter of corporate investments. NYT ALLEGATION: “K.K.R., after starting special funds around 2010 to invest in real estate and other infrastructure projects, donated $450,000 to Brookings, some of it as the institution agreed to set up meetings for a top K.K.R. executive with community leaders in Philadelphia and Detroit, where the company was considering real estate projects. Brookings separately produced a report, published on K.K.R.’s website, promoting one of the company’s infrastructure projects in New Jersey, after the company executive suggested such a piece.” Brookings responds: The building of productive, inclusive cities is dependent on close, collaborative relationships across sectors and the public/private financing of individual projects. As part of its long history of working with local public, private, civic, university and community leaders in cities across the United States, Metro staff routinely act as connectors between leaders of these groups so that they can share best practices and build networks. Whether they are donors has no impact. Metro serves as a bridge between leaders who share different perspectives and travel in different local, national and global circles. In the end, local leaders decide which financial institutions to work with and financial institutions determine which projects are worthy of investment. Brookings has nothing to do with that process. Research focused on public-private partnerships has been a focal point for Metro’s Infrastructure Initiative for many years, long before KKR became a donor to Brookings8. The article published by KKR’s Global Institute was not aimed to promote a KKR project. Rather, it was a study that brought together the expertise of Metro scholars and KKR experts in the field. The paper was intended to benefit local communities by reaching audiences through KKR’s networks. It was also made broadly available to the public. Back to top 12. Brookings did not promote Hitachi’s interests. NYT ALLEGATION: “Hitachi has been another large donor to the metropolitan program, giving a total of $1.8 million to Brookings over the last decade, according to Brookings documents. The think tank reviewed the company’s corporate marketing and sales strategy targeting the United States, an internal memo shows. Brookings also organized public events that featured top Obama administration officials and allowed Hitachi executives to promote their products.” Brookings responds: Brookings reviews research papers and analysis for numerous stakeholders, whether they are donors or not. This was not a special benefit for Hitachi. Brookings experts routinely share their perspectives on important public policy issues, such as the rise of technologically-enabled “smart cities,” with public and private stakeholders alike. Consistent with that approach, the Metro Program contributed its expertise in reviewing a draft of a Hitachi white paper on smart cities, but Brookings had no further role in the publication or dissemination of Hitachi’s paper. In fact, the Metro Program’s own conclusions on aspects of “smart cities” ran contrary to Hitachi’s own interests. As two Metro scholars, amongst others, have argued, “Our technology-first approach has failed the city of the future. [By] focusing on the cutting-edge technologies themselves and relying on private companies to move forward, we have lost sight of what we even want our cities to achieve with all that tech.”9 In asserting that Brookings organized public events to benefit Hitachi, the article links to a Hitachi-produced summary of a 2012 conference hosted by Hitachi, in which Brookings and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) participated and organized panels. Representatives of Hitachi, Brookings, AAAS, and many governmental organizations, including the Obama administration, participated as experts to discuss important public policy issues surrounding water challenges in shale gas production and in cities. The conference included discussion of a wide variety of products and projects, well beyond those in which Hitachi had a direct interest. Greg Fischer, Mayor of Louisville: “Our partnership with Brookings has accelerated the economic development of Louisville, including strategies that have expanded the scope and inclusiveness of our efforts. Our strategies on innovation and globalization have been strongly influenced by Brookings’ research and are fundamental to the transition that is well underway with our city’s economy.” Back to top 13. The NYT misconstrued the goals of the Global Cities Initiative; Brookings did not promote JPMorgan Chase’s business lines. NYT ALLEGATION: “When JPMorgan offered a major donation to the metropolitan program in 2011, Brookings created the Global Cities Initiative, complete with a new logo that called it a ‘joint project of Brookings and JPMorgan Chase.’ The project was premised on a common interest between the bank and the think tank. Brookings wanted to promote economic growth in cities by encouraging international trade, and JPMorgan wanted to gain new business by offering loans to companies in the same markets. In contract documents, Brookings emphasized that it would control the conclusions of its reports and said it would ‘not directly or indirectly communicate with any party’ to help get JPMorgan business.” Brookings responds: Mr. Lipton and Ms. Williams misconstrue the goals of the Global Cities Initiative (GCI) and the structure of this joint project between Brookings and JPMorgan Chase (JPMC). GCI is designed to advance the economic objectives of local and regional communities, not those of any corporation. GCI grew out of work at the Metro Program that pre-dates JPMC involvement. The Metro Program had conducted research about the importance of exports as a source of economic growth for U.S. metropolitan areas in the wake of the Great Recession. With support from the Rockefeller Foundation, the Metro Program launched export-planning efforts in 12 U.S. metro areas in 2010. JPMC’s gift enabled Brookings to deepen and broaden its research, outreach, and impact through the formal Global Cities Initiative, whose purpose was to find solutions to the challenges of economic growth in some 28 cities across the United States. Mr. Lipton and Ms. Williams produce no evidence that GCI activities in these 28 cities in any way helped the efforts of JPMorgan Chase to gain new business in these “markets.” That was certainly not their purpose. Brad Whitehead, President, Fund for Our Economic Future: “Year in and year out, Brookings has served civic leaders in Greater Cleveland as a clear-eyed and challenging thought partner. They provide sometimes painful, sometimes encouraging, but always objective and helpful assessments of what is important to our economic health, how our community measures up, and where we might go. This has resulted in tangible cross-sector initiatives ranging from improving manufacturing competitiveness, pursuing smarter land use, fostering innovation, and addressing economic polarization. Brookings is the bridge from national theory to on-the-ground realities.” Back to top 14. The NYT reporters cherry picked sentences from draft documents and failed to report the strict guidelines for promoting the Global Cities Initiative. NYT ALLEGATION: “At the same time, hundreds of pages of memos—status reports to JPMorgan, internal reports by Brookings staff to prepare for meetings with top bank executives, and formal documents soliciting more money—make clear that Brookings saw the Global Cities Initiative as a branding effort that could help JPMorgan bolster its standing in cities.” Brookings responds: Mr. Lipton and Ms. Williams have selected a few sentences from internal draft working documents, often reflecting early brainstorming sessions, that yield an inaccurate picture of the goals and activities of the Global Cities Initiative. Brookings established the Global Cities Initiative (GCI) to provide a source of practical ideas for how city leaders could grow their economies by actively engaging in the global marketplace. That is the mission that underpins the hundreds of research reports that Brookings has produced, and the scores of meetings that GCI convened in the United States and around the world to help city leaders learn about the research and consider adopting its recommendations. Brookings produced GCI branding and communications guidelines and GCI communications policies specifically to protect the independence of the project and ensure GCI research—not JPMC products—were accurately and appropriately positioned. Here is a sample of the guidelines: JPMorgan Chase advertising about GCI can promote GCI but not JPMorgan Chase. For example, JPMorgan Chase can run ads that use the GCI logo, but the ads cannot also use the JPMorgan Chase name or logo except to communicate that JPMorgan Chase paid for the ad or that JPMorgan Chase funds GCI. Brookings cannot include quotes from JPMorgan Chase employees or representatives in press releases about research. Back to top 15. Brookings has developed strict rules on disclosure of potential scholar conflicts of interest. NYT ALLEGATION: The second story by Mr. Lipton and Ms. Williams, published in the New York Times on August 9, 2016, focuses on think tank scholars whom they allege have conflicts of interest. They cite two Brookings scholars in that regard. Brookings responds: The individuals named in the New York Times story are no longer affiliated with Brookings. The Brookings Committee on Conflicts of Interest promulgated strict rules for disclosure of scholar conflicts of interest earlier this year to avoid a conflict or the perception of a conflict of interest. Our Conflict of Interest Policy and other ongoing efforts to ensure our independence are robust and enforced. The policy and summaries can be found here.

The words of the Robert Frost classic ring true for China’s foreign-exchange reforms, with every economist, strategist and analyst interviewed by Bloomberg saying the yuan isn’t anywhere close to being fully convertible even as it prepares to enter the IMF’s reserves basket on Oct. 1. A true free float is as far as a decade away, the yuan’s top forecaster said, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. produced a still-to-do list that includes the need to ease capital controls and cut back on intervention. QuickTake People's Currency “If fully free floating means a fully convertible currency with no capital restrictions and no currency interventions at all, I do not foresee it in the next five to 10 years,” said Bjarke Roed-Frederiksen, a Copenhagen-based economist at Svenska Handelsbanken, the yuan’s most accurate forecaster as tracked by Bloomberg over the last four quarters. Although the International Monetary Fund decided in November last year that the yuan was freely usable enough to become a global reserve currency, China’s central bank retains strict control even as it pledges to increase the market’s role. The authority restricts onshore yuan moves through a daily reference rate and has been suspected of meddling with the mechanism when the moves don’t suit its aims. It has also been seen guiding weakness against the currencies of its trading partners to try to help exports. Here’s a look at the barriers that market watchers say need to be dismantled before the yuan can be considered a real reserve currency. Trading Limit THE ISSUE: The People’s Bank of China’s daily fixing against the dollar limits the yuan’s moves to 2 percent on either side, which gives the central bank -- rather than the market -- overall control. The central bank sets reference rates against other currencies as well, including the euro, the Australian dollar and the British pound. THE WAY AHEAD: Yu Yongding, a former academic member of the PBOC’s monetary policy committee, says authorities need to train the market to tolerate greater fluctuations. The central bank can hold off on intervention while allowing an undisclosed degree of swings against a basket of currencies, he said. “It will take China three to five years to widen the yuan’s daily band and trading hours before gradually reducing the role of the fixing,” said He Xin, head of China trading at Societe Generale SA. “China should increasingly let market forces play a bigger role in deciding the daily reference rate.” Intervention Concern THE ISSUE: Despite repeated promises of a freer exchange rate, Chinese authorities have been suspected of stepping up intervention since they devalued the currency on Aug. 11 last year. The PBOC fueled speculation that it was supporting the yuan last month, setting a series of stronger reference rates after the currency weakened beyond 6.7 a dollar for the first time since 2010. A 6 percent drop in the yuan this year against a 13-currency index has also fanned talk that the central bank is guiding trade-weighted weakness to help revive exports. The onshore yuan fell 0.1 percent to 6.6457 Friday as data on factory output, retail sales and investment all missed estimates. THE WAY AHEAD: Little change, for the moment. Interventions might become smaller in magnitude and less frequent, but they will remain and not just to smooth volatility, said Roed-Frederiksen. Chinese authorities have a long history of meddling in markets. When local stocks suffered a $5 trillion crash last year, state-linked funds stepped in to support the market, only to watch share prices fall to new lows at the start of 2016. “We believe a free-floating yuan is some way off,” said Brad Gibson, a Hong Kong-based fund manager at AllianceBernstein LP, whose AB RMB Income Plus Portfolio fund has returned 16 percent this year to beat 97 percent of its peers. “It is more of a medium-term development and we would suspect a very heavy hand by the Chinese authorities in the currency market as we go through this stage.” Capital Curbs THE ISSUE: With outflows surging to an estimated $1 trillion in 2015, China clamped down. It stepped up scrutiny of cross-border transactions and froze quotas for a program that lets individuals invest abroad. The nation doesn’t appear to have a problem when the cash is coming in, though, with government-linked entities raising money offshore and bringing it home. THE WAY AHEAD: While the Communist Party’s latest five-year plan proposes increasing the yuan’s convertibility in an orderly manner, progress has been slow. The "come in, don’t go out" approach hasn’t helped efforts to internationalize the yuan, with the currency’s share of global payments dropping to a two-year low of 1.72 percent in June. On Thursday, the PBOC indicated it was planning steps to address the concern, saying it plans to increase cross-border use under the current account and make it more convenient for overseas entities to issue yuan debt in the onshore interbank market. For more on the PBOC’s pledge to give the market a greater say, click here. “A true reserve currency needs free cross-border flows, while a full range of derivative products is essential to foreign investors for hedging,” said Haibin Zhu, chief China economist at JPMorgan in Hong Kong. “The PBOC needs to offer more currency products including swaps, and increase market liquidity by expanding the bond market.” Rate Convergence THE ISSUE: The yuan’s rate in Shanghai differs with that in Hong Kong, which is free of the mainland’s capital controls. The gap was cited by IMF staff in August last year as meaning that the offshore rate can’t be used as a perfect hedge for onshore exposure. The spread, which widened to an unprecedented 2.9 percent in January amid turmoil ignited by a eight-day run of weaker fixings, has since narrowed. THE WAY AHEAD: Policy makers have punished speculation on the spread, pushing offshore yuan borrowing costs to as high as 66.8 percent. It isn’t wise to battle the PBOC by betting the yuan will weaken because the authority will manage sentiment and any declines will be gradual, according to China Merchants Bank. “The aim is ultimately to unify the exchange rates,” said Khoon Goh, head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Singapore. “But before that can happen, the onshore yuan needs to be free floating, currency restrictions lifted and trading expanded to 24 hours seven days. Once they achieve a free float, there is no longer a reason to have an offshore yuan market.” Stocks, Bonds THE ISSUE: The inclusion of Chinese equities and bonds in global gauges would go a long way in pushing the yuan’s use. In June, MSCI Inc. denied local stocks entry into its benchmark indexes, citing a 20 percent monthly repatriation limit as a “significant hurdle” for investors. While policy makers have allowed global funds greater access to the $6.4 trillion onshore interbank debt market, investors flag restrictions such as a ban on onshore foreign-exchange trading, unclear tax rules and curbs on bringing home profits.

The benchmark 10-year sovereign bond yield has plunged to 2.69 percent, the lowest since 2009, after overseas investors increased their holdings of onshore bonds in June by 47.7 billion yuan ($7.2 billion) to 764 billion yuan. Chinese authorities have since February allowed all types of medium- to long-term investors to access the interbank bond market, and said that approved fund managers under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors program no longer have to apply for quotas to invest onshore. “With most advanced bond yields very low or close to zero, the Chinese bond markets offer significant yield pickups and depending on the reforms, could offer very good liquidity,” said Rajeev De Mello, who oversees about $10 billion as head of Asian fixed income at Schroder Investment in Singapore. “There are still a few measures to iron out such as onshore currency hedging for bond investors.” — With assistance by Robin Ganguly, Kyoungwha Kim, and Helen Sun Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

By Scutify Aug 10, 2016 5:25 pm PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. Shares in JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) jumped on last week's blowout jobs report and now investors have to feel good about JPM stock's chance to reclaim record levels soon. At $66 and change, JPM stock isn't that far off its all-time closing high. Nine months ago, it was knocking on the door of $69 a share. That represents less than 5% in additional upside after Friday's move of 2.7%. The technicals are favorable, the market is setting new records session after session and the news flow continues to support a Federal Reserve rate hike sooner than later. But beyond that milestone, JPM could very well be priced to disappoint. A number of Wall Street analysts certainly think so. Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz on Monday cut his rating on JPMorgan to neutral. The market will enjoy a September rate hike if it does indeed come to pass, but the analyst says it's going to take more than that. The 7 Best Cheap Dividend Stocks to Buy Now After all, banks need a sustained cycle of tightening that creates a steeper yield curve. A one-off rate hike isn't going to cut it. Horowitz has a target price of $65 on JPMorgan stock, which implies there's downside ahead. Overestimating JPM Stock? A neutral view on JPM stock isn't exactly a popular view, Horowitz acknowledges. From his note to clients: "JPMorgan is probably one of the most consensus longs on the buy side and sell side (76% of the 38 analyst ratings are Buy), which we believe is reflective of a strong management team that has been able to weather the tough macro and regulatory environment better than peers. So in the context of a group that we view as fairly valued at 10.3% cost of equity... and our view that JPMorgan forward EPS estimates are about 2% too high for 2017 and 2018, we no longer see significant near term upside (15% over one year) to warrant a Buy." But it is wise for investors in bank stocks to curb their enthusiasm about the next Fed rate increase. Yes, this will begin to relieve some pressure on banks' net interest margins, but short-term rates are still going to be sitting at pitiful levels. The central bank is hardly opening the spigot. After the immediate celebratory upside of a rate hike, JPM stock will face fundamentals that haven't changed all that much. Whether that sets it up for underperformance remains to be seen, but there are other big bank stocks offering better bets. As of this writing, Dan Burrows did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

DJIA S&P 500 NASDAQ Markets Today Weak July Retail Sales Won't Change What Fed Does Next It will take more than one month of weak retail sales to sway the Federal Reserve either way at its September meeting, says David Lebovitz, JPMorgan Asset Management. Scott Gamm Aug 12, 2016 10:51 AM EDT July retail sales came in weaker than expected, but as the Federal Reserve's September meeting nears, the central bank isn't relying on any one data point when deciding when to hike short-term interest rates. "It's not going to be any individual data point that causes the Fed to go or stay," said David Lebovitz, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, based in New York. Retail sales, a key gauge of consumer spending, remained unchanged in July, according to a Friday report from the U.S. Census Bureau. Analysts had expected a 0.4% increase. Core retail sales, which doesn't account for food, autos and gas, also showed no growth in July. After June's 0.8% increase in retail sales, Lebovitz said the consumer merely took a pause in July and doesn't think the report is 'terribly troubling.' "I think there's a lot of uncertainty out there," Lebovitz said. "We saw economic growth slow in both the first and second quarter, down from that 2 percent pace that we had been averaging thus far in the expansion." Gasoline sales slipped 2.7%, while auto sales gained 1.1 percent. The national average for a gallon of gas stands at $2.13, compared to $2.23 one month ago, according to AAA. For the Federal Reserve, which is looking to continue to normalize policy after making its first rate hike since the Great Recession back in December of 2015, Lebovitz thinks the Fed will be looking at the broader economic picture, including global developments, rather than any one retail sales or jobs report.

 Goldman Sachs is squaring up against JPMorgan and HSBC to decide the future of gold trading Will Martin Aug. 12, 2016, 5:37 AM 5,052 facebook linkedin twitter email print A worker scoops gold shots at Japanese jewellery brand, Ginza Tanaka's original equipment manufacturer (OEM) factory in the Chiba prefecture, east of Tokyo September 14, 2009. REUTERS/Yuriko Nakao There's a battle brewing in the heart of the gold industry, and some of the world's biggest banks are involved. The fight centres itself around the way in which gold — one of the most divisive assets in the financial markets — is traded. There are two clear camps: People who want precious metals like gold, silver and precious metals to be traded on a new platform regulated by a central exchange. Those who want gold trading to remain as an activity done directly between buyers and sellers. Those two camps, according to a brilliant story from Neil Hume and Henry Sanderson at the Financial Times, contain some of the world's foremost financial institutions. On the side of modernising and creating a new exchange are Goldman Sachs, the most powerful bank in the world when it comes to commodities, and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the giant Chinese lender with more than £2.5 trillion of total assets. Fighting the other corner are what the FT describes as "two big bullion banks" — JP Morgan and HSBC. This pair is backing an initiative from the London Bullion Market Association to improve transparency in the current system, which has previously been criticised for being too opaque in its operations, according to the FT. As it stands, the trading on spot gold — gold bought and sold on the day, rather than as a future — is done over the counter, meaning that no exchange is involved. Advocates of OTC trading say the lack of an exchange provides flexibility and ease of transaction, while as previously mentioned, those who prefer exchange trading criticise it for being opaque and subject to less regulation. The likes of ICBC argue that the gold markets need to evolve or face "declining" in the future."There’s been a decline in liquidity within the London market. It’s clear the market hasn’t evolved for decades," Raj Kumar, head of precious metals ‎strategic development at ICBC Standard Bank told the FT. "With regulatory changes likely in the future the market is at risk of declining without suitable solutions." The fight comes amid a surge in interest among investors in gold. With uncertainty about the future direction of the global economy, fears about what Britain's Brexit vote means for Europe, and serious geopolitical troubles worldwide, the asset that has been used as a haven for thousands of years is back in fashion. Gold's price has increased by more than 25% so far in 2016, and in July, analysts from UBS argued that the metal has entered a so-called "new phase."Investing.com UBS said that the UK's vote to leave the EU has reinforced the risks facing the global economy, boosted uncertainty, and helped to crystallise worries about the effectiveness of unconventional monetary policies like negative interest rates. All of this combines to create an environment where gold is a hugely attractive investment and is right at the forefront of the global markets. You can read the full Financial Times story here.

X US inflation is on the rise - JP Morgan Bond yields indicate investors expect inflation worldwide of 1.17% Fri, Aug 12, 2016, 07:40 JP Morgan Asset Management says the idea US inflation is always going to be low is an anachronism. Photograph: iStock         JP Morgan Asset Management, overseeing $1.7 trillion, says US inflation is picking up. “US inflation has actually come back,” Benjamin Mandel, a strategist for the company in New York, said on Thursday. “This idea that US inflation is low and is always going to be low is an anachronism.” Bond yields indicate investors expect inflation worldwide of 1.17 per cent over the life of securities, the highest level in eight months. The number is derived by comparing yields on nominal bonds to those on inflation-linked debt, using Bank of America indexes. It’s still less than the 2 per cent target set by the central banks in the US, the UK and Japan. Benchmark US 10-year note yields fell two basis points to 1.54 per cent as of 6:39 am in London, Bloomberg Bond Trader data shows. The price of the 1.5 per cent security due in August 2026 rose 5/32, or $1.56 per $1,000 face value, to 99 5/8. The US will publish data on Friday for producer prices, retail sales and consumer sentiment. The yield will climb to 1.7 per cent by year-end, based on the median forecast of economists.       Topics: Benjamin Mandel Bank of America Bloomberg Jp Morgan Asset Management Japan London(GB) New York City United Kingdom United States Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services 1:10 First-time buyer deposits cut to 10% as Central Bank eases mortgage rules Technology Clever cube makes for easier shared viewing English Soccer Ex-England player David White reveals sexual abuse by coach Economy Downbeat Philip Hammond offers little to soothe economic fears Sponsored A bank-beating foreign exchange proposition How ‘nudge theory’ can improve pension provision Black Friday: what is it and how to prepare for it Send an AdMailer Christmas card and help a homeless charity ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Data commissioner steps up investigation into Yahoo hack 20:01 CityJet pilots defer planned airline strike 19:55 Renovated Bewley’s Cafe can seat 500 customers at a time 19:39 Lidl and Aldi to hold prices in Republic despite sterling slide 19:27 Downbeat Philip Hammond offers little to soothe economic fears 18:55 ADVERTISEMENT Most Read in Business 1 Renovated Bewley’s Cafe can seat 500 customers at a time 2 First-time buyer deposits cut to 10% as Central Bank eases mortgage rules 3 Central Bank mortgage rule change: What it means for you 4 What to do in your 20s/30s...if you don’t want to be broke in your 60s 5 Solicitor entitled to damages in Anglo case 6 Shocking revelations at Rush Credit Union are just the start 7 Sorry millennials: Buying a home was just as hard for your parents 8 Thousands affected as RaboDirect axes investment funds 9 Downbeat Philip Hammond offers little to soothe economic fears 10 Will the Central Bank make it any easier to get a mortgage?

JPMorgan Funds - Japan Market Neutral Fund, launched in June 2011, will liquidate after assets dipped to about $17 million as of Aug. 4 following “significant redemptions” in recent months, the firm said in a letter to investors, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. The fund has lost a cumulative 16 percent since inception, according to the firm’s website. Keiko Kobayashi, a JPMorgan spokeswoman in Tokyo, confirmed the liquidation. “Given these redemptions and its historical performance, the Board sees limited prospect of attracting new subscriptions,” according to the letter, which added that assets have fallen below the $30 million liquidation threshold outlined in the fund prospectus. Money managers and hedge funds in Japan have been especially hard hit as they’ve struggled to anticipate how the central bank’s policy of negative interest rates and asset purchases would impact markets. Stock market declines and unexpected events such as Brexit have also spurred losses, prompting investors to take cover. Fund Outflows WisdomTree Investments Inc., an asset manager that specializes in exchange-traded funds, has seen a record outflow of $6.3 billion from its Europe Hedged Equity Fund, while its Japan Hedged Equity Fund has had $4.6 billion of redemptions. Investors pulled about $974 million from Japanese hedge funds in the first quarter, six times more than they did in the same period last year, according to data compiled by Hedge Fund Research Inc. The number of new hedge fund launches last year in Japan dropped to the lowest since at least 2007, according to data from Eurekahedge Pte, with only two funds starting in 2015. Some 65 hedge funds were liquidated in Japan in the five years ended 2015, the data show. The JPMorgan fund sought to achieve returns “in excess of cash” by investing in Japanese companies and using financial derivative instruments, according to information posted on its website.

By: Reuters | Washington | Published:August 12, 2016 3:07 am Wall Street banks are asking the US Federal Reserve to grant them an additional five-year grace period to comply with a financial reform regulation known as the Volcker rule. (Source: Reuters) Big Wall Street banks are asking the US Federal Reserve to grant them an additional five-year grace period to comply with a financial reform regulation known as the Volcker rule, people familiar with the matter said. If the Fed agrees, the extension would give banks more time to exit fund investments that are difficult to sell, but no longer allowed by the law. The added grace period, which follows three one-year extensions, would start next year and run through 2022. The law on Volcker rule implementation says banks can ask for an extra five-year extension for “illiquid” funds, where banks had contractual commitments to invest. In deciding whether to grant Wall Street more leeway, the Fed has asked banks to provide details on their specific investments to prove that they fall under the statutory definition of “illiquid,” said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss non-public regulatory discussions. Those seeking the extension include Goldman Sachs Group Inc , Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co and some other banks, the sources said. They are making their push in part through Wall Street lobbying group the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA).

Congress intended to provide “an appropriate transition period” so that banks could exit illiquid funds without disrupting markets, SIFMA added. The banks and the Federal Reserve declined to comment. The Volcker rule, named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, is part of the sweeping 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. It aims to reduce risk-taking by preventing banks from using their own capital to make speculative bets. Critics say its many loopholes – with exemptions for activities like merchant banking and foreign exchange trading – have made it less effective than it was intended to be. “It’s laughable that the biggest, most sophisticated financial firms in the world claim they can’t sell the stakes year after year,” said Dennis Kelleher, CEO of non-profit Better Markets. “Everyone else in America has to comply with the law and Wall Street should also.” Tough Call The Fed has already granted three one-year extensions for compliance with a broader provision of the Volcker rule regarding stakes in hedge funds and private equity funds – the maximum number of extensions it could provide in that context. The new requests, which were widely expected, concern only “illiquid” fund investments. The Fed risks criticism for giving Wall Street more wiggle room, but also risks blame for fire-sale losses or for banks and their investor clients getting tied up in court if they are forced to exit certain contractual agreements quickly. Before the crisis, big banks had proprietary trading desks that made bets on market direction, as well as in-house hedge funds, investments in external hedge funds and co-investments alongside clients in internal private-equity funds. Underlying assets could range from investments in private companies to real estate and long-dated derivatives. While the regulated banks have spun off much of that activity, bankers say there are still some investments that do not contractually expire for years or lack a liquid market for an immediate sale. But disclosures are few and far between, making it difficult to independently discern how truly illiquid the investments are. Banks are now asking the Fed for more time to exit stakes in funds they deem to be illiquid, sources said. In response, the Fed is demanding more details about why the funds, or their underlying assets, are considered illiquid, how much time it would take to exit the investments and what efforts have been made to exit investments sooner, sources said. In granting banks its final one-year extension last month, the Fed said it would soon provide details on how it will address illiquid funds. Banks have been selling down non-compliant investments over the last several years, with Goldman having reduced its exposure by more than half since mid-2013. Yet in regulatory filings, banks have said they may face difficulty in getting rid of those investments by upcoming deadlines. As of June 30, Goldman Sachs held $7 billion worth of private equity investments, real estate holdings and hedge funds affected by the Volcker rule. In March, Goldman said it expected to sell the majority of those stakes before the July 2017 deadline, but it removed that language in its most recent quarterly filing. Morgan Stanley, which has about $3.2 billion in real estate and private equity funds, recently said it expected to be able to divest much of those investments. But the bank said in a second-quarter filing that it expected to ask for further extensions “for certain illiquid funds.” JPMorgan has around $1 billion in hedge funds, private equity and real estate investments.

A noncontroversial topic, right? Well… no. According to the Financial Times, Fidelity Investments, the $2.2 trillion asset manager, up and walked out of a Dimon-led effort to codify some best practices for American boardrooms. So it seems some of finance's heaviest hitters are divided on the subject of good governance. Nevertheless, the group released a nine-page paper, "Commonsense Corporate Governance Principles." And in it we have a clue as to just what it is that has these titans of finance so divided… What's more, if these guidelines are widely adopted, investing will change, for everyone from JPMorgan on down to individual investors. And most likely not at all for the better… Here's What Has These Kingpins All Fired Up The most unnerving paragraph in "Commonsense Principles" isn't found in the guidelines themselves. There are plenty of "universal" commonsense suggestions discussed in the paper, but as usual, several controversial aspects of the initiative are found in between the actual proposed guidelines. Particularly this: "Our financial markets have become too obsessed with quarterly earnings forecasts. Companies should not feel obligated to provide earnings guidance – and should do so only if they believe that providing such guidance is beneficial to shareholders." The group's positions on earnings guidance by management and quarterly earnings reporting are two volatile issues that need a more thorough airing – and not just on page B8 of The Wall Street Journal. Because, when the white paper says, "Our financial markets have become too obsessed with quarterly earnings forecasts," it really means, "quarterly reporting should be done away with." For the most part, the members of the panel think it's a good idea to follow the European Union's model and have public companies report earnings only twice a year. Even the United Kingdom, which had required quarterly earnings filings, changed to the EU model in 2015, though companies are free to issue quarterly reports at their choosing. For the most part the group feels excessive reliance on quarterly reporting drives short-term thinking on the part of investors, and just as importantly, on the part of managers who try to meet short-term earnings expectations to the detriment of focusing on long-term business planning. How could that be a bad thing? These financiers want all investors to think long term, focus on the big picture, and invest for the future. That's all good, right? No. Just look again at who's doing the suggesting… There's No Way These CEOs Deserve Any Slack Coming from Jamie Dimon, backed as he is by the other big banks that agree quarterly filings are a regulatory burden and focus investors' attention on short horizons, questioning quarterly reporting requirements is a little frightening. On second thought, Jamie Dimon leading the banks' charge for less transparency into their earnings is actually very frightening. Join the conversation.

I know of no one that buys into even a hot dog stand without looking at the books. What one chooses to do with the information is the individual's responsibility. Robotic computer trading is the problem here. The computer reacts to numbers. Some individuals see a failing company as an opportunity, some see it as a disaster. That's human nature. Nobody has figured how to program into a computer. Artificial Intelligence or not. Reply bluto | August 11, 2016 It's time for the government to step in and clamp down on the crazy casino otherwise known as Wall Street. The financial sector in the US is out of control and it should be cut down to size. Requiring corporations to report earnings every six months seems like a good idea. Perfectly reasonable. But Wall Street insiders seem to be discombobulating about it. Reply Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply. Your email address will not be published.

The FBI has multiple investigations on the books involving the Clinton Foundation, according to The Daily Caller.  The one in New York City, where the charity is based, is reportedly headed by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, a prosecutor who made a name for himself in the midst of the the financial crisis by acting on fraud and public corruption cases. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO  U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, a prosecutor who made a name for himself in the midst of the the financial crisis by acting on fraud and public corruption cases, is reportedly probing the Clinton Foundation That the United States Attorney's office in the Southern District of New York is chasing the case could spell trouble for the Clintons. An official who spoke to The Daily Caller said an investigation by Bharara's office 'would be seen by agents as a positive development as prosecutors there are generally thought to be more aggressive than the career lawyers within the DOJ.' Bharara's pursuit of insider trading cases beginning in 2009 earned him a Time magazine cover and the title of 'top cop' to Wall Street.  His office twice forced Citibank to pay substantial sums in 2012 and 2014 for pushing risky loans. In 2012 it also pursued, and won, a mortgage-fraud case against Bank of America. Several of Bernie Madoff's associates we convicted as a result of Bharara's office's work. Madoff's bank, JPMorgan, forfeited $1.7 billion in a separate settlement. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next THREE FBI offices wanted full-scale criminal probe into...

Share this article Share 10k shares His reach has extended beyond the big banks to public officials. State senators, New York city council men and women, even State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, have found themselves in his crosshairs.  Silver was arrested in 2015 and convicted. New York now has its first black State Assembly Speaker, Carly Heastie. Bharara's case against New York's Republican Majority Leader Dean Skelos sent the politician to jail for five years. He warned New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo this spring to stay in line, or he'd come after them, too. The Indian-born prosecutor who is a naturalized U.S. citizen was reportedly considered to replace Eric Holder at the Justice Department when he stepped down. The job was offered to his colleague Loretta Lynch, also of New York, instead.  Bharara's pursuit of insider trading cases beginning in 2009 earned him a Time magazine cover and the title of 'top cop' to Wall Street. He's taken down big banks and lawmakers FBI Director James Comey would not confirm the existence of any investigations into the Clinton Foundation when he testified last month before Congress on the bureau's investigation into the former secretary of state's emails.   'I'm not going to comment on the existence or nonexistence of other investigations,' he said at the time. At least one proposed probe aside from the one reported by the Caller is now known to the public. It came to light this week on CNN. Donald Trump has accused Hillary Clinton of using her position in the Obama administration to orchestrate kickbacks to the foundation her husband started and now bears both their names.  A release of emails this week between her State Department employees and a Clinton Foundation aide, Doug Band, revealed that he urged her office on one occasion to make a specific hire and on another occasion to introduce a donor to a person of 'substance' handling U.S. affairs in Lebanon. The emails, obtained through a court order by conservative government oversight group Judicial Watch, restarted conversations about the Democrat's ability to keep up a firewall between her family's interests and the federal government. It is unclear if Clinton is elected how involved Bill and Chelsea will be in non-profit that was once on Charity Navigator's watchlist over concerns it was acting as a 'slush fund' for the former first family. MORE TROUBLE FOR HILLARY? Hillary Clinton escaped prosecution for her conduct during her tenure at the State Department - her family's foundation may not be so fortunate As Hillary Clinton geared up to make her own bid for 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, investigatory articles into its conduct while she was in the employment of the government turned up results that Republicans like Trump have said are nothing short of concerning, if not criminal.  The foundation was required by the State Department to disclose its donations from foreign governments that had not previously written checks or those that 'materially' increased their gifts once she assumed her role atop the powerful government agency. And yet it did not inform the Obama administration of a $500,000 donation from Algeria in 2010.  Foreign governments have given a significant amount of money to the Clinton Foundation since its creation in 2001 after Bill and Hillary moved out of the White House.  A Washington Post review of its funds last year concluded that foreign donations have accounted for a third of it contributions of a collective $1 million or more over the organization's lifetime. Overall, the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation has raked in $2 billion and counting in the 15 years since it was created from domestic and overseas corporations and private individuals, in addition to foreign governments, the Post determined. The Daily Caller article on the FBI's current investigation, which it says is being jointly coordinated by field offices and headquarters in a unique arrangement, did not say what crime or crimes prosecutors suspect the foundation and its employees of committing. It makes reference to the Washington Post's findings and a CNN report this week that three FBI offices recommended a public corruption investigation into the Clinton Foundation this year but were waved off by the Department of Justice. The proposed investigation stemmed from suspicious banking activity of one of the foundation's foreign donors. CNN did not share the name of the donor in its report. Had the investigation went forward, all of the Clinton Foundation's foreign donations would have been subject to review, the Caller observed, as well as Clinton's activity as secretary of state.    Read more: FBI-US Attorney Probe Of Clinton Foundation Is Underway | The Daily Caller Foreign governments gave millions to foundation while Clinton was at State Dept. - The Washington Post Share or comment on this article e-mail 10k shares Most watched News videos Gruesome moment Korean chef dissects a LIVE octopus Cyclist films moment car causes him to crash then drives away Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Teen films a burning 'meteorite' moving across sky in Japan Shocking moment man hits women in mass chicken shop fight Supermodel Gigi Hadid fights off man who grabs her at Milan show Mystery homeless woman in Rome avoids questions from reporter Kim Kardashian attacked in Paris by notorious prankster Doorman knocks-out troublemaker during two-on-one confrontation What a work-out!
