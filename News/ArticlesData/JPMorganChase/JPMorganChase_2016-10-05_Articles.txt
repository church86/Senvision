For patient, long-term investors, you could do a lot worse than JPMorgan Chase. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 6, 2016 at 11:47AM Chase Tower in Phoenix, Arizone. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Warren Buffett has said in the past that it's "far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price." To me, this describes JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) to a tee. America's biggest bank JPMorgan Chase didn't become the biggest bank in America by accident. It emerged atop the industry in the wake of the financial crisis. Its two principal competitors at the time, Bank of America and Citigroup, had to run hat in hand to the federal government for funds to survive. In JPMorgan Chase's case, the exact opposite was true. The government approached it for help to bail out Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. This happened eight years ago, but it's the culture at JPMorgan Chase that positioned it to thrive through the crisis. And that culture is still present, overseen by chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. No human being is infallible and I'm sure that Dimon has plenty of his own shortcomings, but everything I've read, seen, and heard about him suggests that he's one of this generation's best bankers. Richard Bove, an experienced and respected bank analyst, once told me that Dimon is one of the smartest people he's ever met. Warren Buffett's take on JPMorgan Chase And you don't just have to take my word for it. Buffett has said in the past that Dimon's annual shareholder letter is a must read. And one of Buffett's lieutenants just joined the JPMorgan Chase board. That's about the best seal of approval that a bank can get, when you consider that Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has accumulated the most impressive portfolio of bank stocks since the days of the Money Trust in the early 1900s. All of this matters because, as Buffett explained in his 1990 shareholder letter, the quality of executives at a bank is more important than in any other business: When assets are twenty times equity -- a common ratio in [the bank] industry -- mistakes that involve only a small portion of assets can destroy a major portion of equity. And mistakes have been the rule rather than the exception at many major banks. Most have resulted from a managerial failing that we described last year when discussing the "institutional imperative:" the tendency of executives to mindlessly imitate the behavior of their peers, no matter how foolish it may be to do so. In their lending, many bankers played follow-the-leader with lemming-like zeal; now they are experiencing a lemming-like fate. A low valuation Making JPMorgan Chase even more attractive is the fact that its shares trade at a fair price. They're priced at less than 1.1 times book value while the average bank on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen large-cap bank stocks, is priced at just under 1.2 times book. Think about that for a second. JPMorgan Chase is one of the best-run banks in the country, yet its shares trade for less than the typical large-cap bank. Part of this is because the nation's biggest banks are subject to stricter regulations surrounding capital, liquidity, and stress testing, among other things. The environment right now is also unusually inhospitable for banks, thanks to ultralow interest rates and higher regulatory and compliance costs. Another explanation for JPMorgan Chase's low valuation, in my opinion, stems from the reputational damage that's been done to the industry during and after the 2008 crisis. All banks are trading for low multiples right now, not just JPMorgan Chase, but the big banks suffered the brunt of the damage to their reputations. This may seem like it's unusual, but it's standard operating procedure in a cyclical industry. The same thing happened after the Panic of 1907, the Great Depression, and the multiple crises of the 1980s. When things turn around and interest rates belatedly rise, then banks like JPMorgan Chase will make a lot more money. That will send bank share prices up and reward investors who get in now. In short, every once in a while you get the chance to, in Buffett's words, "buy a wonderful company at a fair price." This is one of those times. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America.

China’s surge in home prices reminds JPMorgan Asset Management’s chief Asia market strategist of last year’s stock market mania. Spiraling leverage and implicit state support are among the common denominators, he says. Shanghai property values jumped 31 percent in August from a year earlier, the latest data show. In 2015, a 60 percent rally in the city’s equities through June 12 was followed by a $5 trillion rout. Deutsche Bank Group AG warned last month that China’s housing market is in a bubble, while Goldman Sachs Group AG said this week it sees growing risks across the real estate industry. Home prices started to take off last year in the wake of the stock market crash after the governments eased curbs on property purchases. In recent days, cities including Shenzhen have started re-imposing restrictions. “It’s similar to the equity market where if you let things loose, it just runs like a stallion," said Hui. "And then you have to really rein it back, then it’s like an ice bucket challenge. So you go through this extreme heat and cold. That’s not particularly good for the economy because then you’re going through very aggressive investment cycles." At stake is the government’s ability to channel funds trapped by capital controls into investments that can boost the economy without creating asset bubbles. Speculative buying of commodity futures earlier this year fueled a boom that quickly unraveled, while a botched intervention to halt plummeting equities dented the credibility of policy makers and roiled global markets. Just as the surge in stocks in the first half of 2015 enervated financial services and provided a fillip to an ailing economy, rampant demand for property is boosting the outlook for commodities and lifting the earnings outlook for construction-related firms. Profits of industrial companies jumped the most in three years in August, while factory output, investment and retail sales also beat analysts’ estimates. Home prices started to climb after China eased mortgage policies and down-payment requirements in March 2015 to arrest what was then a slide in prices. New curbs, such as higher deposits to limits on the number of homes people can buy, are proving ineffective given the easy access homebuyers have to leverage, said Wee May Ling, an investment manager at Henderson Global Investors Ltd. Mortgage Lending Medium and long-term new loans, mostly mortgages, totaled 529 billion yuan ($79 billion) in August, while aggregate financing jumped to 1.47 trillion yuan, helping fuel a 39 percent jump in property sales by value in the first eight months. Private investment in fixed assets, meanwhile, stalled at 2.1 percent for a second straight month in the January through August period, matching a record low. While HSBC Holdings Plc says the overall level of China’s household debt remains low, Deutsche Bank said it sees "clear sign of a bubble" in property -- one that will end in a major correction in two years’ time. Just like last year’s equity boom, China is using credit growth to boost the economy, Zhiwei Zhang, chief China economist at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a report on Sept. 28. “The main concern about China is that it has reverted back to the old model in terms of stimulating growth by monetary and credit side," said Philipp Baertschi, Zurich-based chief investment officer at Bank J. Safra Sarasin Ltd. Higher Costs To be sure, there are signs policy makers are acting to restrain growth in debt. The People’s Bank of China has kept its benchmark lending and deposit rates on hold for nearly a year and banks’ reserve ratios unchanged since February, failing to deliver the additional cuts private economists had forecast in earlier surveys. The central bank has also used longer-term tenors in the open market to drive up funding costs in a bid to rein in leverage. Still, any winding down of debt brings its own risks. “We saw the stock market tumble in 2015 from June throughout the second half, triggered by the unwinding of leverage after margin lending reached record highs," said Jing Ulrich, vice chairman of Asia Pacific at JPMorgan Chase & Co. "Today, an alarming sign is that leverage is also building in the property market." While analysts aren’t predicting home prices to collapse in the manner of the stock market, last year’s experience shows the risk of allowing a leverage-fueled boom to spiral out of control. China’s equity bubble began inflating in late 2014 as policy makers touted the importance of equity financing and state media ran a series of articles promoting the market. As the buzz around shares grew, and home prices stagnated, investors opened new trading accounts at a record pace and took on unprecedented amounts of margin debt. Sixteen months after the Shanghai Composite Index peaked, China’s $6.4 trillion equity market remains subdued. Turnover has, by one measure, fallen to the lowest in two years. A gauge of technology shares, last year’s hottest investment, is down 21 percent this year, while margin debt is still some 60 percent below its peak. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index dropped 0.6 percent on Friday, with mainland markets closed this week. JPMorgan’s Hui says China appears to be repeating the mistakes of the past. "The government seems to just go through wild swings when it comes to control and let things loose because they want growth coming back," he said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The 45th anniversary of the annual ranking of Wall Street's top equity analysts begs the question: Why does the buy side still buy sell-side research? Since May Day 1975, when 180 years of fixed brokerage commissions ended on Wall Street, prognosticators have insisted that sell-side equity research's days were numbered, and doom-and-gloomers saw the relationship between sell-side research and buy-side investing as imperiled. And yet year after year, the sell side has proven surprisingly resilient. Nicholas Rosato, head of North American Research for JPMorgan, argues that for all the fears and fluctuations, what has not changed over the decades is the mutually beneficial relationship with the buy side. "The buy side continues to need and value sell-side research," Rosato affirms. Institutional Investor launched the All-America Research Team ranking in 1972, three years before May Day. The ranking's longevity is evidence of the ability of sell-side research to evolve, adjust and change. "The Institutional Investor All-America Research poll continues to set the standard to identify excellence within the Investment Research ecosystem," says Will Rowlands-Rees, Managing Director of II Research. "This year we saw voters in particular really focus on the Economics/Strategy sectors, with a material increase in overall voting. With an uncertain global macro environment, this doesn't surprise. It just reinforces the continued importance of this process to provide actionable product feedback between Buy and Sell side," he adds. The team is the buy side's judgment on the performance of its outsourced providers of investment analysis; it's an election, not a stock-picking contest. And this year's election has a new victor. JPMorgan had held top honors for five consecutive years, until Bank of America Merrill Lynch edged ahead of it last year. This year, JPMorgan regains its crown with 40 analysts voted on the team -- an improvement of four over 2015 -- beating out BofA Merrill, which saw its total fall by six, to 32. Rounding out this year's top ten firms: 1. J.P. Morgan 2. Bank of America Merrill Lynch 3. Evercore ISI 4. UBS 5. Morgan Stanley 6. Barclays 7. Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. 8. Deutsche Bank Securities 9. RBC Capital Markets 10. Citi In all, this year's team includes 322 analysts from 30 firms. To see the full team, including all ranked firms and analysts, visit www.institutionalinvestor.com/aart. Among the investment trends uncovered by this year's results: In a topsy-turvy year, investors turned to top firms. Eight out of the top ten firms saw their numbers rise, notably Evercore ISI, from 25 to 30, and UBS, from 22 to 28. That was not the case in 2015, but it may suggest that in a topsy-turvy year, investors turned to the top firms, which tend to be larger and more diversified. When it's quality over quantity, JPMorgan is king. The weighted average paints a different picture than the overall leaderboard. This measure gives greater credence to getting higher-ranked analysts voted onto the team. JPMorgan runs away with the weighted average, as it has for a number of years, in which a rating of four is assigned to each first-place position, three to each second-place spot, and so on. The bank racks up 109 points to the No. 2 shop, Evercore ISI, with 79. BofA Merrill slides to fourth this year, with a weighted average of 59. A volatile year led to movement in the ranks by weighted average. Evercore ISI rises from No. 3 in 2015 to No. 2, while UBS hops three spots from No. 6 to No. 3. On weighted average, however, four firms -- UBS, BofA Merrill, Bernstein and Morgan Stanley, both based in New York -- come out neck and neck, with only five points separating No. 3, UBS, and No. 5, Morgan Stanley. Many of the favorite stocks of 2015 fell from favor in 2016. This year's market was one in which much of the gains were coming from a narrowing universe of stocks. An active, value-oriented stock-picker's market -- the kind sell-side research traditionally served -- shifted to big-cap, dividend, share-buyback or defensive plays as the year unfolded. U.S. stock markets profited from investors globally seeking yield, but as Brian Hodess, who runs Bank of America Merrill Lynch's U.S. research effort, says, more than half of fund managers still believe the market is overvalued. A complex set of macroeconomic factors forced sell-side researchers to collaborate. "Brexit, the ECB, the Fed, the Bank of Japan, China -- all have played into an approach of mixing macro research and stock research," says Vinayak Singh, a member of Evercore ISI's executive, management and investment committee. "That requires a tremendous amount of collaboration." At the very least, this kind of research throws up barriers of entry to smaller research shops lacking scale, reach and financial resources. Evercore's Singh talks about talent migration to the bigger firms and consolidation of the sell side. The evidence for that may be in the greater concentration of ranked analysts among the top-ten firms. As it has since 1975, the question of who will pay for sell-side research looms. In Europe, a much-discussed regulatory policy known as Markets in Financial Instruments Directives II (MIFID II) mandates that research be unbundled from commissions, among many other changes, looks like it will finally be implemented on January 2018. U.S. research is not immune. The major firms have European clients and clients that do business on the Continent. The effect? There's some debate about that, but clearly true unbundling will encourage firms to support individual analysts over entire groups, or some firms over others. "If you're in a middle tier, and you don't have products of excellence, you could lose sales," says David Adelman, the director of Morgan Stanley's Americas equity research group. That's slowly occurring anyway in the U.S., he adds, "as clients concentrate their research vote." The 2016 All-America Research Team survey results reflect the opinions of some 3,835 individuals at 1,090 firms, including more than 90 of the 100 biggest U.S. equity managers. Our respondents manage an estimated $11.57 trillion in U.S. equities. For full ranking results, analysis and methodology, visit www.institutionalinvestor.com/aart.

Since May Day 1975, when 180 years of fixed brokerage commissions ended on Wall Street, prognosticators have insisted that sell-side equity research's days were numbered, and doom-and-gloomers saw the relationship between sell-side research and buy-side investing as imperiled. And yet year after year, the sell side has proven surprisingly resilient. Nicholas Rosato, head of North American Research for JPMorgan, argues that for all the fears and fluctuations, what has not changed over the decades is the mutually beneficial relationship with the buy side. "The buy side continues to need and value sell-side research," Rosato affirms. Institutional Investor launched the All-America Research Team ranking in 1972, three years before May Day. The ranking's longevity is evidence of the ability of sell-side research to evolve, adjust and change. "The Institutional Investor All-America Research poll continues to set the standard to identify excellence within the Investment Research ecosystem," says Will Rowlands-Rees, Managing Director of II Research. "This year we saw voters in particular really focus on the Economics/Strategy sectors, with a material increase in overall voting. With an uncertain global macro environment, this doesn't surprise. It just reinforces the continued importance of this process to provide actionable product feedback between Buy and Sell side," he adds. The team is the buy side's judgment on the performance of its outsourced providers of investment analysis; it's an election, not a stock-picking contest. And this year's election has a new victor. JPMorgan had held top honors for five consecutive years, until Bank of America Merrill Lynch edged ahead of it last year. This year, JPMorgan regains its crown with 40 analysts voted on the team -- an improvement of four over 2015 -- beating out BofA Merrill, which saw its total fall by six, to 32. Rounding out this year's top ten firms: 1. J.P. Morgan 2. Bank of America Merrill Lynch 3. Evercore ISI 4. UBS 5. Morgan Stanley 6. Barclays 7. Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. 8. Deutsche Bank Securities 9. RBC Capital Markets 10. Citi In all, this year's team includes 322 analysts from 30 firms. To see the full team, including all ranked firms and analysts, visit www.institutionalinvestor.com/aart. Among the investment trends uncovered by this year's results: In a topsy-turvy year, investors turned to top firms. Eight out of the top ten firms saw their numbers rise, notably Evercore ISI, from 25 to 30, and UBS, from 22 to 28. That was not the case in 2015, but it may suggest that in a topsy-turvy year, investors turned to the top firms, which tend to be larger and more diversified. When it's quality over quantity, JPMorgan is king. The weighted average paints a different picture than the overall leaderboard. This measure gives greater credence to getting higher-ranked analysts voted onto the team. JPMorgan runs away with the weighted average, as it has for a number of years, in which a rating of four is assigned to each first-place position, three to each second-place spot, and so on. The bank racks up 109 points to the No. 2 shop, Evercore ISI, with 79. BofA Merrill slides to fourth this year, with a weighted average of 59. A volatile year led to movement in the ranks by weighted average. Evercore ISI rises from No. 3 in 2015 to No. 2, while UBS hops three spots from No. 6 to No. 3. On weighted average, however, four firms -- UBS, BofA Merrill, Bernstein and Morgan Stanley, both based in New York -- come out neck and neck, with only five points separating No. 3, UBS, and No. 5, Morgan Stanley. Many of the favorite stocks of 2015 fell from favor in 2016. This year's market was one in which much of the gains were coming from a narrowing universe of stocks. An active, value-oriented stock-picker's market -- the kind sell-side research traditionally served -- shifted to big-cap, dividend, share-buyback or defensive plays as the year unfolded. U.S. stock markets profited from investors globally seeking yield, but as Brian Hodess, who runs Bank of America Merrill Lynch's U.S. research effort, says, more than half of fund managers still believe the market is overvalued. A complex set of macroeconomic factors forced sell-side researchers to collaborate. "Brexit, the ECB, the Fed, the Bank of Japan, China -- all have played into an approach of mixing macro research and stock research," says Vinayak Singh, a member of Evercore ISI's executive, management and investment committee. "That requires a tremendous amount of collaboration." At the very least, this kind of research throws up barriers of entry to smaller research shops lacking scale, reach and financial resources. Evercore's Singh talks about talent migration to the bigger firms and consolidation of the sell side. The evidence for that may be in the greater concentration of ranked analysts among the top-ten firms. As it has since 1975, the question of who will pay for sell-side research looms. In Europe, a much-discussed regulatory policy known as Markets in Financial Instruments Directives II (MIFID II) mandates that research be unbundled from commissions, among many other changes, looks like it will finally be implemented on January 2018. U.S. research is not immune. The major firms have European clients and clients that do business on the Continent. The effect? There's some debate about that, but clearly true unbundling will encourage firms to support individual analysts over entire groups, or some firms over others. "If you're in a middle tier, and you don't have products of excellence, you could lose sales," says David Adelman, the director of Morgan Stanley's Americas equity research group. That's slowly occurring anyway in the U.S., he adds, "as clients concentrate their research vote." The 2016 All-America Research Team survey results reflect the opinions of some 3,835 individuals at 1,090 firms, including more than 90 of the 100 biggest U.S. equity managers. Our respondents manage an estimated $11.57 trillion in U.S. equities. For full ranking results, analysis and methodology, visit www.institutionalinvestor.com/aart.

 JPMorgan is developing a new blockchain project BI Intelligence Oct. 5, 2016, 11:33 AM 1,497 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Deloitte and its UK partners have tested a blockchain-based payments system Here's why blockchain will be widely used by 2021 The UK and China have reached a new fintech agreement This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Fintech Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. JPMorgan Chase is working with Ethereum startup EthLab on a new blockchain project called Quorum, the Wall Street Journal and CoinDesk report. The two parties will develop a private, permissioned blockchain built off of the public Ethereum network's code. This is the latest project to come out of JPMorgan Chase's working group, the Blockchain Center of Excellence. Unlike other banks, JPMorgan is not building an entirely new blockchain system from scratch — it is using the concept of a permissioned blockchain. The bank is utilizing a publically accessible code to develop its solution. But unlike public blockchains such as the one used by Bitcoin, JPMorgan's will be private and permissioned, meaning the bank will be able to limit access to transactions to selected parties, such as parties in a trade or a regulator. This will make it private and secure enough for traders to use for transactions, and accessible enough for regulators to provide oversight. Such functionality is considered a vital element needed before banks will adopt blockchain technology widely. This approach stands to give JPMorgan significant advantages over its rivals. Using existing code to build a blockchain solution is significantly cheaper than developing its own network. Moreover, by using a publically accessible network, JPMorgan can build a blockchain that could theoretically be plugged into other systems built on the same network. For context, institutions building their own networks may find their end solutions to be incompatible with each other. This ease-of-use could potentially give JPMorgan an edge over other banks experimenting with blockchain, as its solution may be more likely to be widely adopted.  However, JPMorgan has not addressed concern over Ethereum's security flaws. The network has suffered significant security breaches recently — in its most severe hack, the equivalent of $80 million worth of cryptocurrency was stolen, and the most recent attack occurred just last month. The bank will need to address these concerns before it moves into any live testing phase that involves customers' money.  Blockchain technology, which is best known for powering Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is gaining steam among finance firms because of its potential to streamline processes and increase efficiency. The technology could cut costs by up to $20 billion annually by 2022, according to Santander. That's because blockchain, which operates as a distributed ledger, has the ability to allow multiple parties to transfer and store sensitive information in a space that’s secure, permanent, anonymous, and easily accessible. That could simplify paper-heavy, expensive, or logistically complicated financial systems, like remittances and cross-border transfer, shareholder management and ownership exchange, and securities trading, to name a few. And outside of finance, governments and the music industry are investigating the technology’s potential to simplify record-keeping. As a result, venture capital firms and financial institutions alike are pouring investment into finding, developing, and testing blockchain use cases. Over 50 major financial institutions are involved with collaborative blockchain startups, have begun researching the technology in-house, or have helped fund startups with products rooted in blockchain.  Jaime Toplin, research associate for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on blockchain technology that explains how blockchain works, why it has the potential to provide a watershed moment for the financial industry, and the different ways it could be put into practice in the coming years. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Spending on capital markets applications of blockchain is expected to grow at a 52% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2019, according to Aite Group, to reach $400 million that year. Banks and major financial institutions are working both collaboratively and independently to develop blockchain tech. Over 50 major financial institutions are involved with collaborative blockchain startups, like R3 CEV or Chain. And many are investing in the technology on their own as well. Putting blockchain to use for real-world transactions is likely not that far off. If working groups' tests are successful, firms could be using it to transact real value as early as the end of this year and we could see widespread industry application within the next few years.  In full, the report: Examines the funding increases that are pouring into blockchain Assesses why blockchain is becoming so popular and what factors are driving up increased research and development Explains in full how blockchain technology work and what assets make it valuable and vulnerable Identifies pain points in the financial industry and profiles how various firms are using blockchain to solve them Demonstrates the challenges to mainstream adoption and their potential solutions To get your copy of this invaluable guide, choose one of these options: Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT The choice is yours.

Life Buy/Sell Business Close ALAN SOLOMON The Illinois State Capitol in Springfield was completed in 1888.  Illinois renegotiates derivative deals as rating approaches junk Bloomberg Oct 5, 2016 (…) The Illinois State Capitol in Springfield was completed in 1888.  ALAN SOLOMON Illinois renegotiated interest-rate derivative contracts with banks to avoid having to pay about $150 million of fees if its credit rating gets cut closer to junk. The step comes after S&P Global Ratings and Moody's Investors Service lowered Illinois to the second-lowest investment grade, below any other state. Without the agreement, another downgrade could have allowed Barclays Bank, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank to demand multi-million fees to break the $600 million worth of contracts, which the state entered into more than a decade ago to protect against rising interest bills on variable-rate bonds. The changes, which were finalized on Sept. 28 after months of negotiation, will allow Illinois to avoid the fees as long as it's not dropped below investment grade, according to bond documents. Chicago, the state's biggest city, was forced to refinance derivative-laden debt deals after its rating was downgraded to junk by Moody's last year. "It's a good thing that they were able to do that without getting hit with a termination event, which can put strain on liquidity and cash," said Adam Buchanan, senior vice president of sales and trading at Ziegler, a broker-dealer in Chicago. "It's a positive thing." Illinois is straining under a more than $100 billion shortfall in its pension system that has diminished its standing on Wall Street. The state has been operating without a full-year budget since July 1, 2015 because of political discord between Rauner and the Democrat-controlled legislature, and the current spending plan is set to last for only about half the fiscal year. As a result, the government is on track to spend about $7.8 billion more than it brings in, according to the Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability. S&P lowered its rating on Illinois to BBB on Sept. 30 and has a negative outlook, signaling further downgrades are possible. Moody's rates Illinois an equivalent Baa2. Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Here are the best large places to work in St. Louis Meet the top midsized workplaces in St. Louis Who's hired? Check our People in Business Under the new terms, a termination event — which would force the state to pay the penalties if banks decide to break off the deals — would occur for swaps with Barclays, Bank of America and JPMorgan if Moody's or S&P drop the state to junk. Illinois would have to pay Deutsche Bank if ratings drop three steps to below Ba1 for Moody's or below BB+ for S&P. Deutsche Bank's swap is the largest, accounting for about $99 million of the potential fees. Until the 2008 financial crisis, state and local governments frequently purchased interest-rate swaps when they sold variable-rate bonds. The tactic was intended to prevent governments from being hit with rising expenses if interest rates increased, though the contracts also exposed them to risks that proved costly when credit markets seized up. "Governor Rauner inherited these swaps and letters of credit, which have been hanging over the heads of Illinois taxpayers for years," Catherine Kelly, a spokeswoman for Governor Bruce Rauner, said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. She didn't disclose the terms of the deal, which the statement described as "more favorable." Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

Here is a section: “It’s not just the FTSE 100 -- this is a buy U.K. phenomenon,” said Alan Higgins, chief investment officer at Coutts & Co. in London. His firm oversees 14.6 billion pounds ($19 billion). “We have a really nice combination of sterling weakness, reasonably robust economy and generally not a bad environment for risk assets.” The FTSE 100 and the FTSE 250 climbed 1.8 percent at 3:06 p.m. in London, while the FTSE Small Cap excluding investment trusts index advanced 1.7 percent. The falling pound is helping the three gauges because their members get a big chunk of their revenues from overseas -- almost three-quarters for FTSE 100 companies, and about half for those on the FTSE 250, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS Group AG. JPMorgan Asset Management has estimated the measure of smaller shares also gets about half of its sales from abroad. The pound fell to its lowest level since 1985 on Tuesday, surpassing the bottom reached following the June 23 vote, after three senior figures in Prime Minister Theresa May’s administration said financial-services companies will get no special favors in secession talks. That increased concern that the nation is heading for an exit that would restrict access to the EU’s single market. May said on Sunday she will trigger the process of leaving the bloc by the end of March, which will mark the formal start of a two-year negotiation process. Recent data have reinforced optimism that the domestic economy is weathering the aftermath of the vote. The construction industry unexpectedly grew in September, while a manufacturing gauge jumped to its highest level in more than two years. A Citigroup Inc. index tracking economic surprises in Britain is near a three-year high, and the International Monetary Fund upgraded its outlook for the nation, predicting growth of 1.8 percent this year from the 1.7 percent projected in July. Eoin Treacy's view With the weekend announcement that the UK government is planning to begin negotiating to leave the EU in Q1 2017, and to a large extent signalling it is willing to risk the passporting rights of the City’s financial services companies, a high stakes period of brinksmanship is unfolding. That is putting pressure on the Pound and it extended its downtrend today by breaking to a new low. While a short-term oversold condition is evident a clear upward dynamic would be required to check the slide and signal of low of near-term significance. Australia Stands Pat on Rates as Commodity Rebound Gathers Pace This article by Michael Heath for Bloomberg may be of interest to subscribers. Here is a section: Lowe’s key challenge -- like many of his developed world counterparts -- is generating inflation; part of that involves trying to tame a currency that’s up more than 10 percent in around nine months. The Aussie’s revival, even if partly justified by a jump in iron ore and coal prices and a better outlook for key trading partner China, puts pressure on services industries that are key growth drivers for the post-mining boom economy. The new governor offered insights to his strategy in the RBA’s renewed agreement with the government, stressing financial stability concerns as part of monetary policy. The risk of further stoking Sydney’s housing boom should discourage him from further cuts, especially as the economy grew an annual 3.3 percent last quarter and unemployment has fallen to 5.6 percent amid rising terms of trade, or export prices compared to import prices. Coking coal prices have surged more than 150 percent this year as output from China, the world’s biggest miner, tumbles under government pressure to cut overcapacity. Iron ore, Australia’s biggest export, has rebounded 30 percent, though analysts are skeptical about the rally’s durability. Still, the jump in prices for Australia’s biggest exports is a boon for the economy and a government struggling to rein in its budget deficit. Eoin Treacy's view The recovery in commodity prices from depressed levels at the end of last year has been a benefit to just about all commodity exporters. Australia’s dependence of some of the major resources China’s economy requires not least  iron-ore, coal and natural gas means that the rebound in all three has been a major influence on the advance in the stock market this year. Eoin's personal portfolio commodity longs increased Email of the day on the possible nationalisation of Deutsche Bank Hello I have a question, I think they will nationalize Deutsche Bank but doesn't that mean that the stock is suspended and the equity holders get wiped out? That would create a panic on the market anyway wouldn't it? Eoin Treacy's view Thank you for this question which may be of interest to other subscribers. Yes, if Deutsche Bank is nationalised the equity shareholders would be wiped out and since this would not be the first Eurozone bank to have the same fate we cannot rule out the possibility.   Fuller Treacy Money Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version The information provided on this website (www.FTMoney.com) is for the purposes of information only.  This website and its content is not and should not be considered or deemed to be an offer of or invitation to engage in any investment activity.  Nothing FT Money does and nothing on this website is intended to operate or be construed as the giving of advice or the making of a recommendation by FT Money to any investor or prospective investor.

The step comes after S&P Global Ratings and Moody's Investors Service lowered Illinois to the second-lowest investment grade, below any other state. Without the agreement, another downgrade could have allowed Barclays Bank, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank to demand multi-million fees to break the $600 million worth of contracts, which the state entered into more than a decade ago to protect against rising interest bills on variable-rate bonds. The changes, which were finalized on Sept. 28 after months of negotiation, will allow Illinois to avoid the fees as long as it's not dropped below investment grade, according to bond documents. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Chicago, the state's biggest city, was forced to refinance derivative-laden debt deals after its rating was downgraded to junk by Moody's last year. "It's a good thing that they were able to do that without getting hit with a termination event, which can put strain on liquidity and cash," said Adam Buchanan, senior vice president of sales and trading at Ziegler, a broker-dealer in Chicago. "It's a positive thing." Illinois is straining under a more than $100 billion shortfall in its pension system that has diminished its standing on Wall Street. The state has been operating without a full-year budget since July 1, 2015 because of political discord between Rauner and the Democrat-controlled legislature, and the current spending plan is set to last for only about half the fiscal year. As a result, the government is on track to spend about $7.8 billion more than it brings in, according to the Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability. S&P lowered its rating on Illinois to BBB on Sept. 30 and has a negative outlook, signaling further downgrades are possible. Moody's rates Illinois an equivalent Baa2. Under the new terms, a termination event -- which would force the state to pay the penalties if banks decide to break off the deals -- would occur for swaps with Barclays, Bank of America and JPMorgan if Moody's or S&P drop the state to junk. Illinois would have to pay Deutsche Bank if ratings drop three steps to below Ba1 for Moody's or below BB+ for S&P. Deutsche Bank's swap is the largest, accounting for about $99 million of the potential fees. Until the 2008 financial crisis, state and local governments frequently purchased interest-rate swaps when they sold variable-rate bonds. The tactic was intended to prevent governments from being hit with rising expenses if interest rates increased, though the contracts also exposed them to risks that proved costly when credit markets seized up. "Governor Rauner inherited these swaps and letters of credit, which have been hanging over the heads of Illinois taxpayers for years," Catherine Kelly, a spokeswoman for Gov. Bruce Rauner, said Tuesday. She didn't disclose the terms of the deal, which the statement described as "more favorable."   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES It's not easy being black at BYU, film shows NHL: Coyotes F Brad Richardson carted off ice on stretcher Utah lawmakers: Time to take 'training wheels' off booming solar industry, retire tax credit BYU football: UMass' struggles as independent, FBS newcomer, paint a cautionary tale Utah football: Hunter Dimick takes center stage for Utah's defense ELEVATE Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   From Wall St to Hawaii to Utah Valley: UVU Professor Cary Wasden Mentors MBA Finance Students   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

Related Content Global real assets CEO retiring from J.P. Morgan Asset Management TIAA puts all real estate under one unit, splits relaunched core property fund into sectors Cincinnati Retirement System commits $50 million to open-end infrastructure fund Hawaii sets $40 million for open-end real estate fund ICI: Worldwide open-end fund assets fall 5.6% in third quarter Bristol County Retirement seeking open-end real estate manager A potent mixture of public market declines and investor sophistication is starting to eat away at open-end real estate fund managers' lunches. Net inflows into open-end real estate funds dropped 25% to $8 billion in the second quarter from the $10 billion in each of the prior two quarters, said the Investment Company Institute's second quarter report — its most recent. While inflows are up from the second quarter of 2015, net inflows had dropped 16.6% in the third quarter of last year. What's more, open-end fund managers are seeing their first exit queues — despite the net inflows — since 2010. This is a big change for open-end funds that were the post-crisis darlings when investors tilted their portfolios toward core real estate and lined up to invest. Redemptions and distributions of funds in the Open End Diversified Core Equity index rose in the second quarter to $12.8 billion, offset by $18.3 billion in contributions on a four-quarter rolling basis, according to data from the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries, Chicago. Redemptions and distributions were up 26% from $10.1 billion in the first quarter and up 80% from $7.1 billion in the second quarter of 2015. “We're in a position where the large majority of funds don't have large incoming queues and many don't have incoming queues at all, and some funds are beginning to form redemption queues to get out,” said Peter Rogers, a Chicago-based senior investment consultant and head of Americas real estate research for consulting firm Willis Towers Watson PLC, Chicago. “We're eagerly awaiting the third-quarter redemption numbers to see if indeed rebalancing or redemptions continue, indicating a bigger shift.” Managers of open-end funds say some of their investors are moving capital out of their funds to rebalance their overall portfolios as falling public markets push real estate allocations near or over their targets. “We did see some rebalancing in the first half of 2016,” said Joseph K. Azelby, managing director and CEO, global real assets in the New York office of J.P. Morgan Asset Management (JPM). This resulted in outflows from some of JPMAM's open-end funds, but JPMAM executives declined to reveal the exact amount of open-end fund inflows and outflows. Sources with knowledge of the situation said that in the third quarter J.P. Morgan's $30.6 billion core open-end fund had an exit queue of close to $300 million — but also an entry queue of about $600 million. J.P. Morgan's $3.5 billion value-add open-end fund has no exit queue and an entry queue of about $100 million, the sources said. “We continue to see solid inflows,” Mr. Azelby said. “We see everything from the traditional pension funds still adding to their core real estate allocations and we still see investors relatively new to the real estate space coming into our (open-end) real estate funds.” Willis Towers Watson's Mr. Rogers agreed that some of the redemptions are due to rebalancing, but he is keeping an eye on the trend. Investors seek more control The redemption issue comes at a time when investors are seeking more control over their real estate portfolios, a move that is at odds with diversified open-end funds. In September, TH Real Estate, the new name for the real estate business of TIAA Global Asset Management, transformed its $2 billion U.S. diversified open-end fund into five open-end funds; a diversified open-end fund and four sector-focused sleeves. TH Real Estate last year launched a set of sector-focused real estate funds in Europe and is considering a similar set for the Asia-Pacific region, said Randy Giraldo, managing director of the U.S. focused open-end funds. “We heard from existing clients and clients from other products that they are seeking more sector-specific strategies and are moving away from generalist strategies,” Mr. Giraldo said. Investors can invest in the diversified fund or choose the investment mix by using the sector-specific sleeves. A decade ago there were fewer ways for asset owners to invest in direct real estate. But “since the financial crisis the pendulum has swung sharply from open-end to co-investment and separate accounts,” he said. At the same time, institutional investors have become more sophisticated. Some are adding staff, while offshore investors are moving from passive investments to joint ventures and establishing their own real estate management offices, Mr. Giraldo said. “This is the result of the slow movement to add sophistication. We wanted to capture that trend by giving investors the ability to allocate across property types as they see fit.” What's more, several real estate and private equity managers have launched value-added and core-plus open-end funds, which once just boasted mostly core funds. J.P. Morgan, Carlyle Group and Blackstone Group all have non-core open-end funds. Question of liquidity The suspension of trading by seven U.K. retail open-end real estate managers after the Brexit vote, due to lines of investors trying to get out, was a reminder that open-end funds are not always liquid. A number of managers were forced to block redemptions while they sold properties to give investors their money back, noted Jason Yablon, a New York-based senior vice president and global portfolio manager with Cohen & Steers Inc. This is a lesson that institutional investors also learned in the financial crisis, when many open-end funds established redemption gates to avoid selling properties at one of the lowest points of the real estate market, he said. Cohen & Steers offers open-end real estate investment trust funds but does not offer open-end funds that own properties directly, Mr. Yablon said. “There is a liquidity mismatch with trying to offer daily liquidity when you own illiquid, direct real estate assets that by their nature don't trade daily.” Open-end fund “liquidity is never a problem until it's a problem,” quipped Mark Grinis, global real estate private equity leader in the New York office of consulting firm Ernst & Young. “Look at 2008. Look at Brexit. Pick your event. You can't run for the exits at the same time,” he said. “Typically people run to the exit at the same time.” NCREIF data show the impact of a run for the doors can last for a long time. As a result of the financial crisis, redemptions and distributions outpaced contributions of the ODCE funds on a four-quarter rolling basis for two years — ending in the third quarter of 2010. U.K. open-end funds are still feeling the impact of Brexit, including continued redemptions, Mr. Grinis said. Still, the open-end fund universe has grown substantially in the past seven years, Mr. Rogers noted. The number of funds in the NCREIF ODCE index has grown to 24 from 14 in 2009, a nearly 72% increase, he said. But not all investors favor open-end funds. The real estate portfolio of the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board, Santa Fe, is a combination of REITs and real estate invested in closed-end funds, said Bob Jacksha, chief investment officer of the $11.7 billion pension fund. So far, New Mexico Educational officials have stayed away from open-end funds due to the queues to get in, Mr. Jacksha said. “Also, the large diversified funds tend to be invested in core assets,” he said.  “In our view, core assets are and have been expensive for some time. ... While core assets are traditionally viewed as high quality and thus relatively "safe,' we question that orthodoxy if they are overpriced.” New Mexico Educational has 7.3% of total fund assets invested in real estate, somewhat over its 7% target allocation, Mr. Jacksha said. Earlier this year, pension officials sold some REITs to rebalance. n This article originally appeared in the October 3, 2016 print issue as, "Redemptions, investor shifts put pinch on open-end funds".

Here's A Way To Think About It (Seeking Alpha) Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) bought $26.6 million worth of his own company's stock, and the timing couldn't have been better. According to Bloomberg, JPMorgan's stock bottomed on that day and has since returned more than 25 percent. The 500,000 shares Dimon bought are now worth north $33 million; the stock is trading near the highest level it has seen in a year. JPMorgan's stock hit a 52-week high of $69.03 in November, and shares were trading at around $67.50 early Thursday morning. Dimon bought shares of the company he runs because he believed it was cheap and was hard hit amid a worldwide decline in stocks that plagued the first few months of the year. Related Link: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Bought $26 Million Of Company's Stock The New York Times said in February that Dimon's purchase may serve as a "recognition" that shares of financial companies have become "relatively cheap." The publication's assessment wasn't entire accurately, as Dimon's purchase helped boost the stock higher by 8 percent and haven't looked back since. However, many of JPMorgan's international banking peers have failed to offer investors a similar return. Bloomberg noted that Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C), Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC), Credit Suisse Group AG (ADR) (NYSE: CS) and Deutsche Bank AG (USA) (NYSE: DB) were "also struggling at the time," but "not all of them have seen the same type of comeback."

By Scutify Oct 05, 2016 10:40 pm PRINT   Stay Connected This article is published in collaboration with Scutify, where you can find real-time markets and stock commentary from Robert Marcin, Cody Willard and others. Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. The Wall Street Journal had an amusing article a few days ago in which analysts bumped up GDP forecasts for numerous reasons including inventories, exports in general, and soybeans in particular. Let's investigate the claims. Please consider Soybeans Are Fueling U.S. Economic Growth (But Not for Long). U.S. agricultural exports have surged the past two months, helping cut the trade deficit and boosting the outlook for short-term economic growth. One big factor? Soybeans. Bumper harvests at home, crop shortfalls in South America and solid demand-especially from China-have propelled international feed sales. "Soybean exports will add about 1% to [third-quarter] GDP growth," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note to clients. Mr. Shepherdson is forecasting 4% annualized growth in third-quarter gross domestic product, a broad measure of economic output. That's a big improvement from 1.4% GDP growth in the second quarter and 0.8% in the first. But it does little to alter the longer-term outlook. First, exports are likely to return to trend while depleted crop inventories would be a drag on GDP. Second, the economy has averaged a modest 2.1% growth rate over the course of the expansion, a trajectory that seems unlikely to change despite some noise from quarter to quarter. "The soybean boost is indeed a one-time thing. It has no implications for trend growth and likely will reverse over the next couple quarters," Mr. Shepherdson said. Shifting Outlook Following the commerce department international trade report on September 29, other analysts bumped up their forecasts as well. J.P. Morgan Chase revised its outlook to 3% annualized growth in the third quarter, up from its earlier estimate of 2%. Amherst Pierpont Securities boosted its forecast to 3.7% from 3.5%. Macroeconomic Advisers raised its tracking forecast by three-tenths to 3.1%. Barclays inched up to 2.6% from 2.4%. Is JPMorgan reading Shepherdson? The other way around? Regardless, Shepherdson's forecast got me curious about a number of things, namely soybeans and the trade deficit. Trade Deficit Shrinks More Than Exected In Trade Deficit Shrinks a Bit More Than Expected: Impact on GDP Estimates? I took a stab at the impact. Impact on GDP? The impact on tomorrow's Atlanta Fed GDPNow estimate and the FRBNY Nowcast estimate for 3rd quarter GDP is guesswork two ways. First, I do not know what their model predicted. Second I do not know how their model will react even if I did know what it predicted. Thus, this seemingly good result might not turn out that way if the models predicted even better results. Nonetheless, I am willing to take a stab: The impact from this report will be small, but slightly positive on third quarter GDP estimates (+0.05 to +0.10) percentage points. GDPNow Impact I was on the low side. A check of the GDPNow Model Data (shows the net effect ofall exports went from -0.13 to +0.13 between September 28 and September 30. The deficit shrinkage will add something like 0.26 percentage points to third quarter GDP. Soybeans are only a tiny portion of exports. Balance of Trade Balance of trade chart from Census Bureau. That chart is through August. Is another stellar month coming up in September? Based on soybeans? Price of Soybeans At $9.63 per bushel, the price of soybeans is up from a year ago, but down substantially from second quarter. It's not clear why soybeans will add anything to third quarter GDP. Are exports soaring? USDA Soybean Statistics Let's investigate USDA Soybean Statistics as of September 2016. *Crop Year: September 1 through August 31 If we assume soybean exports will rise by 100 million bushels from the previous year, and apply all of it to third quarter GDP, at a price of $9.63, soybean exports would add $963 million to GDP. The entire production increase from last year is only $2.8 billion. From first to second quarter, Real GDP went from $16,525 billion to $16,583 billion, an increase of $58 billion (seasonally adjusted annualized). Factor GDP by quarters if you like, but also factor soybeans exports by quarters as well. Soybean Exports Chart from Allendale Weekly Export Sales report on 8-11-2016. In the Allendale Weekly Export Sales report on 9-22-2016 (for the period September 8-15) we find this blurb. US: Soybean export sales totaled 875,724 metric tonnes (all 2016/17, no 2017/18). This was under the 900,000 - 1,200,000 trade expectation. USDA's whole-year goal comes to 1.985 billion bushels, a new record. That would be 2% over last year and 22% over the five year average. Amusingly, corn seems better. US: Weekly export sales for the period from September 8 - 15 were released this morning. Corn export sales totaled 921,903 metric tonnes (all 2016/17, no 2017/18). This was just over the 700,000 - 900,000 trade estimate. USDA's goal for the year, at 2.175 billion bushels, would be a record. It would be 14% over last year and 36% over the five year average. With only two full weeks figured of the new crop year done, our total sales come to 707 million bushels, 84% over last year and 43% over the five year average. Due to good pre-September sales, we are ahead of the pace needed. In September, only the incremental export increase (if any) from August will add to 3rd quarter GDP. We had a huge jump from July to August, is another huge jump coming? A reversal actually seems more likely. Regardless, the notion that soybeans or corn exports (corn at $3.48) will add 1% to 3rd quarter GDP is ridiculous.

The 45th anniversary of the annual ranking of Wall Street's top equity analysts begs the question: Why does the buy side still buy sell-side research? Since May Day 1975, when 180 years of fixed brokerage commissions ended on Wall Street, prognosticators have insisted that sell-side equity research's days were numbered, and doom-and-gloomers saw the relationship between sell-side research and buy-side investing as imperiled. And yet year after year, the sell side has proven surprisingly resilient. Nicholas Rosato, head of North American Research for JPMorgan, argues that for all the fears and fluctuations, what has not changed over the decades is the mutually beneficial relationship with the buy side. "The buy side continues to need and value sell-side research," Rosato affirms. Institutional Investor launched the All-America Research Team ranking in 1972, three years before May Day. The ranking's longevity is evidence of the ability of sell-side research to evolve, adjust and change. "The Institutional Investor All-America Research poll continues to set the standard to identify excellence within the Investment Research ecosystem," says Will Rowlands-Rees, Managing Director of II Research. "This year we saw voters in particular really focus on the Economics/Strategy sectors, with a material increase in overall voting. With an uncertain global macro environment, this doesn't surprise. It just reinforces the continued importance of this process to provide actionable product feedback between Buy and Sell side," he adds. The team is the buy side's judgment on the performance of its outsourced providers of investment analysis; it's an election, not a stock-picking contest. And this year's election has a new victor. JPMorgan had held top honors for five consecutive years, until Bank of America Merrill Lynch edged ahead of it last year. This year, JPMorgan regains its crown with 40 analysts voted on the team -- an improvement of four over 2015 -- beating out BofA Merrill, which saw its total fall by six, to 32. Rounding out this year's top ten firms: 1. J.P. Morgan 2. Bank of America Merrill Lynch 3. Evercore ISI 4. UBS 5. Morgan Stanley 6. Barclays 7. Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. 8. Deutsche Bank Securities 9. RBC Capital Markets 10. Citi In all, this year's team includes 322 analysts from 30 firms. To see the full team, including all ranked firms and analysts, visit www.institutionalinvestor.com/aart. Among the investment trends uncovered by this year's results: In a topsy-turvy year, investors turned to top firms. Eight out of the top ten firms saw their numbers rise, notably Evercore ISI, from 25 to 30, and UBS, from 22 to 28. That was not the case in 2015, but it may suggest that in a topsy-turvy year, investors turned to the top firms, which tend to be larger and more diversified. When it's quality over quantity, JPMorgan is king. The weighted average paints a different picture than the overall leaderboard. This measure gives greater credence to getting higher-ranked analysts voted onto the team. JPMorgan runs away with the weighted average, as it has for a number of years, in which a rating of four is assigned to each first-place position, three to each second-place spot, and so on. The bank racks up 109 points to the No. 2 shop, Evercore ISI, with 79. BofA Merrill slides to fourth this year, with a weighted average of 59. A volatile year led to movement in the ranks by weighted average. Evercore ISI rises from No. 3 in 2015 to No. 2, while UBS hops three spots from No. 6 to No. 3. On weighted average, however, four firms -- UBS, BofA Merrill, Bernstein and Morgan Stanley, both based in New York -- come out neck and neck, with only five points separating No. 3, UBS, and No. 5, Morgan Stanley. Many of the favorite stocks of 2015 fell from favor in 2016. This year's market was one in which much of the gains were coming from a narrowing universe of stocks. An active, value-oriented stock-picker's market -- the kind sell-side research traditionally served -- shifted to big-cap, dividend, share-buyback or defensive plays as the year unfolded. U.S. stock markets profited from investors globally seeking yield, but as Brian Hodess, who runs Bank of America Merrill Lynch's U.S. research effort, says, more than half of fund managers still believe the market is overvalued. A complex set of macroeconomic factors forced sell-side researchers to collaborate. "Brexit, the ECB, the Fed, the Bank of Japan, China -- all have played into an approach of mixing macro research and stock research," says Vinayak Singh, a member of Evercore ISI's executive, management and investment committee. "That requires a tremendous amount of collaboration." At the very least, this kind of research throws up barriers of entry to smaller research shops lacking scale, reach and financial resources. Evercore's Singh talks about talent migration to the bigger firms and consolidation of the sell side. The evidence for that may be in the greater concentration of ranked analysts among the top-ten firms. As it has since 1975, the question of who will pay for sell-side research looms. In Europe, a much-discussed regulatory policy known as Markets in Financial Instruments Directives II (MIFID II) mandates that research be unbundled from commissions, among many other changes, looks like it will finally be implemented on January 2018. U.S. research is not immune. The major firms have European clients and clients that do business on the Continent. The effect? There's some debate about that, but clearly true unbundling will encourage firms to support individual analysts over entire groups, or some firms over others. "If you're in a middle tier, and you don't have products of excellence, you could lose sales," says David Adelman, the director of Morgan Stanley's Americas equity research group. That's slowly occurring anyway in the U.S., he adds, "as clients concentrate their research vote." The 2016 All-America Research Team survey results reflect the opinions of some 3,835 individuals at 1,090 firms, including more than 90 of the 100 biggest U.S. equity managers. Our respondents manage an estimated $11.57 trillion in U.S. equities. For full ranking results, analysis and methodology, visit www.institutionalinvestor.com/aart.

Morgan Investment Management Inc. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'AAAmmf' rating reflects: --The fund's overall credit quality and diversification; --Low exposure to interest rate and spread risks; --Holdings of daily and weekly liquid assets consistent with shareholder profile and concentration; --The capabilities and resources of J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. PORTFOLIO CREDIT QUALITY/DIVERSIFICATION The fund seeks to maintain a diversified, high credit quality portfolio consistent with Fitch's criteria for 'AAAmmf' rated money market funds (MMFs) by investing in highly rated securities with limited exposure to individual issuers. The fund may lend money for short-term temporary purposes to other J.P. Morgan funds, subject to meeting the conditions of an SEC exemptive order granted to the fund permitting such interfund lending. MATURITY PROFILE The fund seeks to limit interest rate and spread risk by maintaining a weighted average maturity (WAM) below 60 days and a weighted average life (WAL) below 120 days. As of Oct. 4 2016, the fund's WAM and WAL were 32 days and 98 days, respectively. LIQUIDITY PROFILE The fund seeks to maintain sufficient levels of daily and weekly liquidity to meet investors' flows. At a minimum, the fund seeks to maintain 10% of its portfolio in daily liquid assets and 30% in weekly liquid assets. As of Oct. 4, 2016, the fund's daily and weekly liquid assets were 47% and 63%. FUND OBJECTIVE The fund seeks high current income with liquidity and stability of principal. INVESTMENT ADVISOR The fund's investment adviser is J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. Fitch views J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc.'s investment advisory capabilities, financial and resource commitments, operational controls, corporate governance and compliance procedures as consistent with the 'AAAmmf' rating assigned to the funds. RATING SENSITIVITES The rating may be sensitive to material changes in the credit quality, market risk, and/or liquidity profiles of the fund. Temporary deviations from metrics outlined in Fitch's criteria need not automatically result in a rating change, provided the fund manager is able to address them with credible near-term remedial actions. However, material adverse and continued deviations from Fitch's guidelines for any key rating driver may lead to the rating being placed on Rating Watch Negative or downgraded. SURVEILLANCE Fitch receives fund holdings information and other pertinent data from the fund in order to conduct surveillance and to maintain the rating.

Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

Economy Federal Reserve Capitol Report Economic Report Columns Darrell Delamaide Irwin Kellner Rex Nutting Tools Economic Calendar Real Estate Location Scouts realtor.com My MarketWatch Watchlist Alerts Games Log In Home Press Release Fitch Affirms JPMBB 2013-C17 By Published: Oct 5, 2016 3:19 p.m. ET Share CHICAGO, Oct 05, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Fitch Ratings has affirmed 13 classes of JP Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust (JPMBB 2013-C17) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 2013-C17. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmations are based on overall stable performance of the underlying collateral pool. As of year-end 2015, aggregate pool-level NOI has improved 4.8% from 2014 and remains 2.5% higher than issuance. As of the September 2016 remittance, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 2.4% to $1.056 billion from $1.082 billion at issuance. There have been no delinquent, specially serviced or defeased loans since issuance. Nine loans appear on the servicer's watchlist (9.3%) due to declines in Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR), large tenant lease expiration, and a major casualty event. In particular, The Palms at Westheimer (2.2% of the pool) was affected by two incidences of fire in December 2015 displacing residents and destroying multiple units. The borrower has stated 52 of 798 units were taken off-line and are in the process of being restored. Since the fire, the borrower has made timely payments and an insurance check was deposited into a loss draft account. The borrower has sufficient loss business coverage extending for 12 months. The Dolfield Business Park loan (0.9%) is a notable Fitch Loan of Concern due to a substantial decline in occupancy to 39% from 91% due to several large tenants vacating at lease expiration. The loan is secured by a 71,400 sf office property in Owings Mills, MD. The borrower has several parties interested in the vacant space. The pool has two properties, Rivertowne Commons and Springfield Plaza (7.2%) with exposure to K-Mart as a tenant. K-Mart represents at least 20% of the NRA at each property. Although neither store was listed on any recent closing list, the exposure remains a concern based on the distressed credit of the retailer and pattern of frequent store closures. This pool has an above-average concentration of multifamily properties, which represent 25.6% of the total pool balance. This is above the average concentrations of 12.2% for the 2013 vintage for Fitch-rated transactions. Additionally, this transaction has a below-average concentration of hotel properties, which represent 8.5% of the total pool balance; the 2013 vintage average hotel concentration was 14.2%. The largest loan in the pool, Jordan Creek Town Center (10.9% of the pool), is a 10-year amortizing loan. The loan is subject to a $100 million pari passu note which is part of the JPMCC 2014-C18 transaction. The collateral consists of 503,034 sf of a 1.1 million-sf regional mall located in West Des Moines, IA. The property is anchored by Dillard's (non-collateral), Younkers (non-collateral) and Scheels All Sports. Sponsored by GGP, the loan is performing in line with expectations at issuance. As of June 2016, the mall was 94% occupied, compared to 95% at issuance. The servicer reported second quarter 2016 (2Q16) DSCR was 1.66x, compared to 1.63x at year-end (YE) 2015 and 1.59x at issuance. The Des Moines market is experiencing substantial growth with numerous development projects slated for completion including new retail developments, residential projects and several billion-dollar data centers planned by Google, Microsoft and Facebook. The second largest loan, EIP National Portfolio (8.8%), is secured by seven industrial buildings encompassing 3.2 million sf. The properties are located in six states, with two in Ohio and one each in Illinois, Florida, Pennsylvania, Texas and Michigan. The portfolio is currently leased to seven tenants: Toys 'R' Us, Staples (rated 'BBB-'), Rite-Aid, International Paper Company, Plastipak Packaging, HEB Grocery Company and Commonwealth, Inc. As of March 2016, the portfolio was 100% occupied with reported DSCR of 1.72x. Three tenants (50% of NRA) have extended lease terms since issuance, including the largest tenant in the portfolio, Toys 'R' Us (20%), and the second largest tenant, Staples (17%) which renewed for seven and 10 years, respectively. The Toys 'R' Us at the Youngstown, OH location was replaced by HMS Manufacturing Co. on a lease through 2022. Rite-Aid (13%) also renewed for five years, which mitigates the risk of closure due to the proposed acquisition of Rite-Aid by Walgreens Boots Alliance. The third largest loan, The Aire (8.4%), is secured by a 43-story luxury multifamily building located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The property is a 310-unit, 42-story luxury residential building constructed in 2010 that features numerous amenities and high-end finishes. Lincoln Center and The Julliard School are located across the street from The Aire, and Central Park, Riverside Park and The Shops at Columbus Circle are within walking distance. The loan is subject to a $135 million pari passu note, which is part of the JPMCC 2013-C16 transaction. The collateral is performing in line with underwritten expectations with occupancy of 95% (as of June 2016) and second quarter 2016 DSCR of 1.77x, compared to the 92% occupancy and 1.16x DSCR at issuance. According to Reis' 2Q16 report, the Upper West Side submarket of Manhattan had an apartment vacancy rate of 4.3% with average asking rents of $5,006. The subject is performing in-line with the submarket. RATING SENSITIVITIES Rating Outlooks for all classes remain Stable due to overall stable performance of the pool and continued amortization. Upgrades may occur with improved pool performance and significant paydown or defeasance. Downgrades to the classes are possible should overall pool performance decline. Fitch will continue to monitor the performance of the properties with exposure to K-Mart and the potential for closure.

REUTERS/Dylan Martinez/File Photo By Eric Onstad | LONDON LONDON Commodities will battle to regain a prized place in many portfolios after the "super cycle" fizzled out and in a world of muted global growth, executives at JP Morgan Asset Management said. The sector could, however, claw back a shred of its former glory by providing some diversification benefits, they said during a conference by the fund manager in London this week. During a commodities boom mainly spurred by China's hunger for infrastructure in the years leading up to the global financial crisis, many investors boosted allocations to commodities to capture strong emerging market growth while diversifying from equities and bonds. But during subsequent years of the financial crisis, commodities often moved in tandem with other asset classes. "The rule of thumb is that assets diversify until they become fashionable," said John Bilton, head of the global strategy team for multi-asset solutions at JP Morgan Asset Management. The group is one of the world's biggest fund managers with assets of $1.7 trillion. "Commodities went from being a source of diversification to a source of additional return in portfolios." NO LONGER STAR PERFORMER The 19-commodity Thomson Reuters/Core Commodity CRB Index soared fourfold from early 1999 until touching a peak in July 2008, but has since slumped by more than half. Those former buoyant returns are not due to come back as China's transition to a consumer-led economy is moderating commodity demand and elsewhere heavy debt burdens will weigh on economic growth for years to come, he added. One bright area is that unloved commodities are no longer marching as much in step with other asset classes. "The opportunity for commodities to become more of a diversifier going forward is certainly there, but it's unlikely they're going to be the star performer in terms of returns." Bilton is advising clients to diversify through a host of methods from volatility funds to currencies. Institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance groups are also keen to diversify, but commodities are not on their radar, said Sorca Kelly-Scholte, head of EMEA pensions solutions and advisory at the fund manager. "Our view is that holding the actual commodities is not a long-term investment strategy for most pension funds. It may offer you some inflation protection over the long-term, but there's no added value from it." Other assets, such as infrastructure and real estate can provide inflation protection as well as added value, she added. Despite the long term slide in commodities, the sector has outperformed in recent months as oil and metals rebound, with the CRB Index up 15 percent since early April. That has driven natural resource funds, which have been popular recently among investors shifting from hedge funds and long-only funds into UCITs, a brand of funds regulated in the European Union (Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities). "Interestingly enough, this year the number one performing sector has been the natural resources sector... so we've seen a lot of clients passively allocate to commodities," said Natasha Petiton, vice president in strategic product management. "But I don't think we're seeing a big trend in terms of significant target allocation to commodities, more of a tactical strategy."

Yields rose for a fourth day across maturities as futures traders lifted the probability of a 2016 Fed hike to the highest since August. A gauge of the yield curve flattened after the Institute for Supply Management’s non-manufacturing index jumped last month to the highest since October 2015, after a slump in August. “You can see the reaction on an intraday basis right after the release -- the big increase in rates and the flattening in the curve -- both consistent with the repricing of the Fed,” said Priya Misra, head of global interest-rate strategy in New York at TD Securities (USA) LLC, one of 23 primary dealers that trade with the central bank. “The non-manufacturing data is a more important indicator because we are largely a service economy. It’s telling you that the momentum in the third quarter is solid.” Investors are weighing economic data against actions of global central banks for clues about the path of U.S. interest rates. Treasuries fell Tuesday in sympathy with German bunds after a Bloomberg report said the European Central Bank will gradually wind down bond purchases before the conclusion of its quantitative-easing program. Several Fed officials in the past week have talked up the possibility of a rate increase as soon as the central bank’s November meeting. Yields on two-year notes, the coupon maturity most sensitive to Fed policy expectations, rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 0.83 percent as of 5 p.m. in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data, the highest closing level since Aug. 26. It touched 0.85 percent, the highest on an intraday basis since June 3. The price of the 0.75 percent note due September 2018 was 99 27/32.  The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield rose two basis points to 1.7 percent. Traders assign about a 64 percent probability of a hike by year-end and a 24 percent chance of a boost at the Fed’s meeting next month, according to futures data compiled by Bloomberg. The calculation is based on the assumption the effective fed funds rate will trade at the middle of the new range after the central bank’s next boost. JPMorgan Chase & Co. says the benchmark Treasury yield can climb as high as 2 percent this year, joining Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in predicting a level unseen since January. “An improved growth outlook continues to bolster an outlook for higher interest rates in the fourth quarter,” JPMorgan strategists led by Jay Barry in New York wrote in a client note dated Oct. 4. “We think the 10-year yield can stretch as far as 2 percent.” The benchmark yield dipped to a record-low 1.318 percent on July 6, when the market-implied odds of higher U.S. rates by December stood at just 12 percent. The Federal Open Market Committee left its benchmark rate unchanged last month, noting the case for an increase had strengthened and describing risks to the economic outlook as “roughly balanced.” The U.S. probably added 174,000 jobs in September, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists, up from 151,000 the month before. Like JPMorgan, economists at Goldman Sachs see benchmark Treasury yields climbing to 2 percent by year-end, fueled by an improving outlook for inflation and economic growth. Faster inflation hurts the value of bonds’ fixed payments. The weighted average forecast of analysts in data compiled by Bloomberg is for the yield on the benchmark note to end the year at 1.74 percent. “All of the signals are suggesting that we are now pretty close to full employment, and we’re starting to exert some upward pressure on inflation,” Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs in New York, said in a Sept. 27 interview with Bloomberg Television. “The Fed is going to respond to that. Gradually, but I think they will respond.” The gap between yields on five- and 30-year debt, a gauge of the yield curve, flattened to about 1.18 percentage points.

Most Popular Korean firm leaves Stony Brook, Start-Up NY Mortgage rates jump after Trump election LI vitamin maker NBTY changes its name Chili's manager takes away vet's free meal Zwanger-Pesiri to pay $8M in plea deal In 2003, Samuel Rudick and Patricia Rudick, who is now deceased, took out a $1.75 million loan for their Westhampton home. The Rudicks had the loan modified a year later, before taking out a second mortgage on the home in 2006. Later that year the two loans were consolidated with a third note, totaling $2.47 million. The original lender, JP Morgan Chase Bank, placed a lien on the home before sending a note of default to the Rudicks, “stating that they had defaulted on their mortgage loan by failing to tender their monthly payments,” Judge Joseph Santorelli wrote in his ruling Tuesday. In 2008 JP Morgan commenced a foreclosure action. “At some point that action was discontinued, and then the bank commenced a second foreclosure action,” said Ivan Young of the Young Law Group. According to documents, that second, 2014 action was dismissed for missing the six-year deadline started by the first foreclosure action. “Then they [U.S. Bank] commenced a third foreclosure action, in 2015.” Real EstateOpen houses for 155 storm-damaged LI homes underway Young, who said he has worked on “a dozen” foreclosure cases invoking the statute of limitations in the last two years, said what made the Rudicks’ case more complex was the change in lenders. The first two actions were initiated by JP Morgan Chase, before the loan balance was transferred to U.S. Bank in 2014. advertisement | advertise on newsday The lender still has a mortgage lien on the property, but Rudick can now file court papers seeking to have the lien removed, Young said. U.S. Bank has until Nov. 3 to file a notice of appeal if it will try to get the dismissal of the foreclosure overturned. A spokesman for the lender declined to comment. Young said he has worked on four cases in which judges dismissed foreclosure actions because lenders missed the six-year deadline. In one, a Brooklyn family was able to get the $75,000 mortgage lien on their property removed, so they now own it free and clear, Young said. In another case, a lender has appealed the dismissal of a foreclosure action on a Sound Beach home; the Appellate Division is expected to hear oral arguments soon, Young said. Under state law, the clock starts running when a lender first files a foreclosure case declaring the entire loan due, Young said. If that original case gets dismissed, the lender must file a new case within six years of calling in the loan. The Rudicks’ house, at 18 Alden Lane in the hamlet of Quiogue, is known as the Frederick Burrell Cottage and was built during the 1910s, according to a Southampton Town historic resources survey. Tweets from https://twitter.com/NewsdayBiz/lists/newsday-biz-staff A small number of Long Island homeowners have sought to have their foreclosures dismissed for exceeding the statute of limitations in recent years. The dismissals show how slow the foreclosure process is in New York. In 2007, lenders filed more than 13,000 foreclosure cases against homeowners, more than double the number in 2005, according to Nesconset-based real estate data company LI Profiles. The number peaked in 2009 at more than 19,000. With Maura McDermott and Laura Mann Get the Biz Briefing newsletter!

Richard Florida @Richard_Florida Oct 6, 2016 Comments Share on Facebook Tweet Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program Globalization and urbanization go hand in hand. The world, I’ve long argued, is spiky. The 40 largest mega-regions produce two-thirds of global economic output and 90 percent of global innovation, while housing just 18 percent of the world’s population. But we lack solid data on global cities. (My own work uses satellite data on the world at night, which has its own limitations.) A new report, “Redefining Global Cities,” by the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program fills an important gap here, providing detailed data on the 123 largest global cities based on their metro economies. The report, released as part of the Global Cities Initiative (a joint project of Brookings and JP Morgan Chase), develops data on economic output, productivity, globalization (via foreign direct investment), innovation (based on patents and venture capital investment), talent (population with tertiary education), and global connectivity (via measures of airline passengers and Internet connectivity). The report uses these data to create a new typology of the seven types of global cities. The first three are the world’s leading economic power centers. Global Giants: These are the world’s leading economic and financial centers, its foremost global cities. They include New York, Los Angeles, London, Paris, Tokyo, and Osaka-Kobe. Knowledge Capitals: These are world’s leading knowledge and tech hubs. They include 19 cities centers such as San Jose (the Silicon Valley), Boston, Seattle, San Diego, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Austin, Dallas, Atlanta, Portland, and Denver in the U.S. and Amsterdam, Stockholm, and Zurich in Europe. Asian Anchors: These are Asia’s five established and rising economic power centers: Hong Kong, Singapore, Seoul-Incheon, Shanghai, Beijing—and Moscow. Their ability to attract foreign direct investment makes them serious global power players despite having lower levels of economic output than the Global Giants. In addition to the global economic powerhouses, the report identifies four other types of global cities in the U.S. and around the world which occupy the middle ranks of the world economy. Some are growing in sync with globalization, others are more challenged by it. American Middleweights: These are 16 mid-sized U.S. metro areas, including places that are growing via connections to the global economy, including Miami and Rustbelt metros like Cleveland, Detroit, and Pittsburgh, which have up until now have seen their major industries challenged by global competition. International Middleweights: This group includes 26 mid-sized metros outside the U.S., including Toronto and Vancouver in Canada; Brussels, Rome, Milan, Berlin, Vienna, Madrid, and Barcelona in Europe; Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth in Australia; and Tel Aviv in the Middle East. Many of these cities are aspiring tech and knowledge hubs and serve as centers for talent, as well. Factory China: This set includes 22 second- and third-tier Chinese cities that are manufacturing powerhouses. Even though these metros have experienced rapid growth based on export-intensive manufacturing, they remain relatively poor. Emerging Gateways: These are 28 large global business and transportation gateways for major national and regional markets, including Mexico City, Sao Paolo, Rio de Janeiro, Istanbul, Mumbai, and Johannesburg. (Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program) *** Detailing these seven broad types, the report aptly points out “there is no one way to be global city.” Each global city or metro has its own assets that enable it to better compete and prosper in the global economy. The task of economic development is to identify and build on those assets. Globalization might make us feel small in a growing world, but the lessons of urbanization should remind us how much more powerful we can be when we get connected. Together, these 123 global cities power global competitiveness. They generate a third of global economic output, account for nearly two-thirds of all innovations (based on patents), and represent more than 80 percent of all venture-capital investment in high-tech startups, while housing just 13 percent of the world’s population. That said, globalization and global urbanization does bring substantial challenges that are rising today more than ever. In a major speech based on the report, Amy Liu, who leads the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program, noted the challenges and divides that come with such concentrated spikes of global economic activity. The irony now is that all this energy and progress comes amidst a new environment: growing skepticism about global trade, concerns about immigrants and refugees, and pessimism about a slow-growing world economy… . How can cities deepen their efforts to be globally engaged and competitive while addressing head on the disparities and negative consequences that come with greater global integration? That’s the question that lies at the heart of our global cities and our collective global future.

Senior advisers at top Wall Street firms are speaking to representatives of the lender about ideas including a share sale and asset disposals, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. Deutsche Bank could also revisit selling its Deutsche Postbank unit or parts or all of its asset-management division, the people said. A spokeswoman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan, 55, has been under pressure to stem a slide in shares that has eroded about half of the company’s market value this year, compounded by concerns about mounting litigation costs. The CEO last week reassured investors that he doesn’t plan to raise capital after the U.S. Department of Justice requested $14 billion to settle a probe into faulty securities, having earlier ruled out a sale of the asset-management business. “While a capital increase would be a painful step, a potential asset-management sale would boost the capital ratios and that’s Deutsche Bank’s issue at the moment,” said Andreas Plaesier, an analyst at Warburg Research with a hold rating on the stock. The reports show “that the lender has some plans up its sleeve,” he added. Deutsche Bank shares rose 0.5 percent to close at 12.09 euros in Frankfurt Friday, bringing gains this week to 4.5 percent. The shares have dropped 46 percent this year. The banks are offering to help underwrite a stock sale to raise about 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) should the bank need it, the people said. That is about the maximum amount in discounted shares Deutsche Bank can sell without needing shareholder approval, the people said. The firm could also go to shareholders to request approval for more funds. Deutsche Bank is deliberating whether to sell the shares once it reaches a settlement with the Justice Department in the probe tied to residential mortgage-backed securities, said the people. No final decisions have been made and the bank could decide against a capital increase, they said. The result will largely depend on the size of the fine, which Bloomberg Intelligence estimates may range from $4 billion to $8 billion based on settlements of similar investigations of other banks, the people said. The latest to settle were Morgan Stanley, which agreed to a $2.6 billion settlement, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which accepted a $5.1 billion deal. Partial Selldown Banks are also pitching a partial selldown of Deutsche Bank’s asset management business, two of the people said. The potential offering may not happen before the first half of next year, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing people briefed with the situation. While Cryan in a memo to staff last month ruled out a sale of the asset-management division, calling it an “essential part” of the company, the business could be worth an estimated 9.5 billion euros, according to Autonomous Research LLP. A sale of the unit was considered the second least-likely by investors among six options to restore market confidence, with a rights issue the most likely outcome, Autonomous said, citing a Procensus survey. JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. are the top-ranked advisers on share sales globally this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Dimon, Lagarde Some bank managers are also offering public words of encouragement, which could help secure mandates down the road. JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, in an interview with CNBC on Oct. 4, said the German lender should be able to weather its problems. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde told Bloomberg Television on Thursday that a settlement would “deliver some certainty as to what weight the bank will have to carry and whether it matches with its provisions or not.” Deutsche Bank, which also faces a  money-laundering probe tied to its Russian operations, had set aside 5.5 billion euros for litigation at the end of June. Cryan has already said that the bank may fail to be profitable in 2016, as he eliminates thousands of jobs and cuts risky assets to boost capital and profitability. Anchor Investors The lender has informally spoken to potential anchor investors, including new and existing shareholders, to back a possible capital increase, the people said. Qatar’s royal family is considering increasing its stake in Deutsche Bank to as much as 25 percent from about 10 percent, people familiar with the matter said Friday. Some of Germany’s biggest publicly traded companies are prepared to buy shares in Deutsche Bank to prop up the lender in the event of a potentially crippling legal fine in the U.S., German newspaper Handelsblatt reported on Thursday. The bank’s biggest shareholders include the Qatari royal family, BlackRock Inc. and Norges Bank, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Deutsche Bank, which houses Europe’s largest investment bank, has long struggled to adapt to an era of tougher capital requirements and diminished trading revenue. The lender’s common equity Tier 1 ratio, a measure of financial strength, was at 10.8 percent at the end of June. Cryan is targeting a ratio of at least 12.5 percent by the end of 2018. Investors and bankers have also called on Deutsche Bank to provide clarity on its business strategy. The debate revolves around whether the firm should retain its status as a universal financier or if it should retreat to its roots of being a German and European corporate lender and retail bank, jettisoning the investment bank. Deutsche Bank is scheduled to release third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

On Tuesday, councilmembers approved borrowing $13.385 million from JP Morgan Chase Bank at a 2.15 interest rate with a “callable” option to pay off the note after seven years. City Manager Tim Rooney said the loan closing will be held within the next 10 days. In August, voters approved by 55 percent extending the tax to 2030 for $25 million in various projects. The first project residents can expect, Rooney said, will be upgrades to the city’s waste water plant treatment, as well as engineering for the widening of SW 89th Street. Another lead-off project will be the expansion of Town Center, the official said, and the design and engineering selection for the city’s new fire substation and emergency operations center. Overall, 10 percent of the tax will be slated for public safety, including the new sub-fire station and EOC on the east side of the city, new police and fire employees, software upgrades, new vehicles and equipment, as well as raises for existing personnel, city leaders have reported. For the remaining 90 percent, the city will focus on road improvements, new water lines, sewer upgrades and numerous other projects. Quality of life projects planned are an all-inclusive playground and splash pad, more senior center parking at Town Center, animal shelter renovation, soccer field lighting and a new Mustang Market Place. Projects are subject to change, based on the city’s priorities, Rooney has been reported as saying. He said if a tornado were to ever devastate Mustang, the city would be flexible with the sales tax funds in order to address those pressing needs. The city’s first loan payment will be $445,000 in March 2018. Subsequent payments will be due every September and March until 2030 as currently planned.

(NYSE:CIT), cit.com, a leading provider of commercial lending and leasing services, announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell CIT Commercial Air, its commercial aircraft leasing business, to Avolon Holdings Limited ("Avolon"), the international aircraft leasing company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bohai Capital Holding Co. Ltd. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2017, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. CIT has received a "non-objection" from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for its Amended Capital Plan subject to the closing of the transaction. The Amended Capital Plan authorizes CIT to return $2.975 billion of common equity to shareholders from the net proceeds of the sale; return up to an additional $0.325 billion of common equity contingent upon the issuance of a similar amount of Tier 1 qualifying preferred stock; and pay common dividends totaling $64 million per year after the transaction is completed, subject to quarterly approval by the CIT Board of Directors. "The sale of CIT Commercial Air represents an important milestone for CIT and follows an extensive dual-track process that was designed to maximize shareholder value. This transaction will strengthen our balance sheet, simplify our business and enable us to return significant capital to our shareholders," said Ellen R. Alemany, Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer of CIT Group. "We are making meaningful progress on our strategy to create a leading national middle-market bank. I want to thank all of our employees, and in particular those in Commercial Air, whose solid commitment to building an outstanding franchise over more than 40 years has enabled the success of this transaction." CIT is selling the CIT Commercial Air business to Avolon, including its operations, forward order commitments, and as of June 30, 2016, certain assets of $11.1 billion and liabilities of $1.7 billion. The Adjusted Net Assets Amount total $9.4 billion which Avolon is purchasing for a price of $10.0 billion, representing a premium of 6.7%. The transaction is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals in the United States, China and certain other foreign jurisdictions, the approval of Bohai's shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. HNA Group, Bohai's majority shareholder, has agreed to vote its shares in Bohai in favor of the transaction. To reflect its commitment to the transaction, Avolon has deposited $500 million into an escrow account with a U.S. bank (which will be increased to $600 million during the pendency of the transaction), which is payable to CIT at closing as part of the purchase price and in certain circumstances if the transaction is not consummated. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC served as exclusive financial advisor to CIT Group, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch provided capital markets structuring advice. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen Katz served as legal counsel to CIT Group. Sullivan Cromwell provided bank regulatory advice on the Amended Capital Plan.

(NYSE:CIT), cit.com, a leading provider of commercial lending and leasing services, announced today that it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell CIT Commercial Air, its commercial aircraft leasing business, to Avolon Holdings Limited ("Avolon), the international aircraft leasing company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bohai Capital Holding Co. Ltd. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2017, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions. CIT has received a "non-objection from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for its Amended Capital Plan subject to the closing of the transaction. The Amended Capital Plan authorizes CIT to return $2.975 billion of common equity to shareholders from the net proceeds of the sale; return up to an additional $0.325 billion of common equity contingent upon the issuance of a similar amount of Tier 1 qualifying preferred stock; and pay common dividends totaling $64 million per year after the transaction is completed, subject to quarterly approval by the CIT Board of Directors. "The sale of CIT Commercial Air represents an important milestone for CIT and follows an extensive dual-track process that was designed to maximize shareholder value. This transaction will strengthen our balance sheet, simplify our business and enable us to return significant capital to our shareholders, said Ellen R. Alemany, Chairwoman and Chief Executive Officer of CIT Group. "We are making meaningful progress on our strategy to create a leading national middle-market bank. I want to thank all of our employees, and in particular those in Commercial Air, whose solid commitment to building an outstanding franchise over more than 40 years has enabled the success of this transaction. CIT is selling the CIT Commercial Air business to Avolon, including its operations, forward order commitments, and as of June 30, 2016, certain assets of $11.1 billion and liabilities of $1.7 billion. The Adjusted Net Assets Amount total $9.4 billion which Avolon is purchasing for a price of $10.0 billion, representing a premium of 6.7%. The transaction is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals in the United States, China and certain other foreign jurisdictions, the approval of Bohais shareholders and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. HNA Group, Bohais majority shareholder, has agreed to vote its shares in Bohai in favor of the transaction. To reflect its commitment to the transaction, Avolon has deposited $500 million into an escrow account with a U.S. bank (which will be increased to $600 million during the pendency of the transaction), which is payable to CIT at closing as part of the purchase price and in certain circumstances if the transaction is not consummated. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC served as exclusive financial advisor to CIT Group, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch provided capital markets structuring advice. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz served as legal counsel to CIT Group. Sullivan & Cromwell provided bank regulatory advice on the Amended Capital Plan.

This means the growth outlook for the U.S. and Europe is looking up. Gregg Greenberg Oct 6, 2016 3:41 PM EDT Emerging markets (EM) are stabilizing as commodity deflation has finally run its course. This means the growth outlook for the U.S. and Europe has improved, said Joseph Seydl, U.S. equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank (JPM) . "More so for Europe, which is three to four times more exposed to EM from a trade perspective," said Seydl. Seydl said this has important implications for interest rates. In his view, the ECB's big easing earlier in the year was an insurance policy against the commodity pain in EM. Now that the pain is over the ECB is now on hold, which is stabilizing global interest rates. Seydl also does not see the U.S. presidential election turning back the clock on globalization and breaking up the banks, despite the heated rhetoric from both sides. Inertia, in his view, is a powerful force in politics. Are U.S. equities in a bubble because of low interest rates? Seydl said it's true if rates were to suddenly spike then equities would need to be revalued lower. But he does not see this happening anytime soon.
