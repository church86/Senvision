Speaking to journalists on Monday, François Villeroy de Galhau, who is also a governing council member of the European Central Bank, said: “We are having discrete but numerous and serious contacts” with banks in the UK about relocations. He said that “Paris has every chance” of attracting banks. Read more JPMorgan confirms hundreds of UK jobs to move to EU because of Brexit Earlier this month, JPMorgan said it would move hundreds of London jobs to Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg in preparation for Brexit. Daniel Pinto, the firm’s head of investment banking, said at the time that JPMorgan cannot afford to wait for confirmation on how the industry will be regulated after the UK leaves the EU. The sector is crucial to the UK economy and contributed about £71bn to the Exchequer last year, according to professional services firm PwC. Many banks have indicated that they will be forced to move at least some staff and are making contingency plans for a number of potential Brexit outcomes.

Goldman Sachs’ Europe chief executive, Richard Gnodde, confirmed in March that the bank would relocate hundreds of staff out of London before any Brexit deal is struck and said it had already begun implementing those plans. Axel Weber, chairman of UBS, said in January that about 1,000 of the bank’s 5,000 jobs in London could be at risk.

Everything from star traders to fast computers to unique analysis can give a big hedge fund an advantage over competitors. The latest battleground is data. Investors are vying for new data sets that their competitors don't have, or haven't thought of using. These can range from the basic credit-card sales information to satellite data that tracks shipping routes, and parsing this kind of data for trading signals has been called "the future of investing." The industry providing this to the funds has sprung up amid an explosion in obtainable data over the past decade. The bad news for the regular investor: the cost of data, and the complexity associated with turning it into investment insights, means it will probably only be available to the biggest and most sophisticated funds.  At JPMorgan's macro quantitative and derivatives conference on May 19, the bank surveyed 237 investors, and asked them about Big Data and Machine Learning. It found that 70% thought that the importance of these tools will gradually grow for all investors. A further 23% said they expected a revolution, with rapid changes to the investment landscape.  Screen Shot 2017 05 26 at 11.23.36 AMMore (JPMorgan) "There was widespread agreement that Big Data and Machine Learning is transforming the investment landscape across different trading frequencies, with more than 80% of participants expecting a reduction in relevance of traditional data sources," JPMorgan said in a note.  To be specific, 52% of investors felt big data was already rendering traditional data sources (like financial statements and economic releases) ineffective. In other words, the quarterly reports that many regular investors rely on are already becoming less relevant.  Screen Shot 2017 05 26 at 12.43.42 PMMore (JPMorgan) The rise of so-called alternative data has created a cottage industry of firms that source, process and consult on various data sources. The market for this data is expected to double in the next five years in the US, from $200 million today to $400 million, according to a recent TABB Group report. More than half (51%) of investors surveyed said they expected to buy semi-processed data, while 29% said they wanted to fully process in-house by consuming raw data.  Respondents to the survey were particularly interested in credit card and transactional data. Investors are able to use anonymous data gleaned from credit card statements, and the rise of online shopping, and the digital receipts we get in our email, is also a boon. That's because emailed receipts are usually itemized, giving investors greater detail into what people are buying. Screen Shot 2017 05 26 at 12.43.54 PMMore (JPMorgan) The biggest impediment? Cost. While a lack of expertise and management buy-in were cited by respondents as challenges, the most frequently cited impediment was high-fixed costs. That finding is striking, given JPMorgan's event attracted big money investors like BlackRock and AQR, with sizeable budgets to spend on the data, expertise and processing power. If they find it expensive, the regular investor has no chance.  NOW WATCH: Crocs has a new comeback plan — here's why it could actually work More From Business Insider Wall Street's workforce is slowly and relentlessly shrinking A definitive breakdown of the gloomy state on Wall Street A consumer-protection rule that had been delayed by Trump is set to go through Reblog Share Tweet Share Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

Even for a banker as wealthy as him, that was a big cheque to write for the purchase - made at prices of between US$53.13 and US$53.30 for each JPMorgan share. With hindsight, the timing of his purchase proved fortuitous. At JPMorgan's Friday close of US$85.36, Mr Dimon is sitting on a tidy paper profit of more than US$16 million just 15 months after his purchase. But that had not been the only time Mr Dimon stepped in to buy JPMorgan shares in a big way to reflect the confidence he felt about the bank that he has run for more than a decade. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up In July 2012, he had bought about US$17 million worth of JPMorgan shares at prices between US$34.01 and US$34.46 apiece shortly after the bank reported a US$4.4 billion hit to quarterly earnings caused by a trading desk in London. At current market prices, that purchase would have given Mr Dimon a paper gain of US$25.6 million. For some investors, the timing of Mr Dimon's purchases offers further proof of the usefulness of closely tracking the trades of corporate insiders in order to make money on their stock portfolio. PHOTO: REUTERS JPMORGAN'S JAMIE DIMON US$26m What he spent on shares in his own firm last year. 500k Number of shares bought. US$16m What he has made in paper profit in just 15 months. There are other examples, besides Mr Dimon, of shrewd insiders who have bought into shares when their prices had been temporarily depressed by a run of bad news. In our own backyard, we have DBS Bank boss Piyush Gupta, who bought 200,000 DBS shares at $13.88 apiece in February last year as his bank's share price sank to a six-year low. That purchase had cost him almost $2.8 million - not a sum to sneeze at as well. As it turns out, that purchase has panned out well too. As the DBS share price recovered strongly, Mr Gupta sold 500,000 shares at an average price of $20.53 apiece on May 3. After the sale, he continues to hold directly and indirectly about 1.12 million DBS shares, according to a filing with the Singapore Exchange. Based on the May 3 average selling price of $20.53, this would mean that he made a profit of $1.33 million on the 200,000 DBS shares he bought on the market last year, before deducting transaction costs. Even tracking the share buybacks made by a company can serve as a "buy" signal for investors as well. Take Genting Singapore, for example. In 2015, the casino operator spent $78.12 million buying back its own shares at between 79 cents and $1.01 apiece as its share price tumbled. Queried about the scale of the share buyback during the company's annual general meeting that year, Genting's chairman Lim Kok Thay argued that the buybacks "send a signal that the company and management know best the value of the business" and urged investors to "take it from there and make their own decisions". Genting's purchases might have been a tad early as its share price continued to languish for another year or so, after it stopped its buybacks. But Genting has rebounded well above the highest price it had paid for its share buyback, as it rose by 55 per cent in the past eight months to $1.165 last Friday. Given these examples, there would appear to be a good case to be made for tracking trades made by insiders, and companies' buyback of shares. ST PHOTO: FELINE LIM DBS' PIYUSH GUPTA $2.8m What he spent buying the bank's shares last February. 200k Number of shares bought. $1.33m What he made after selling the shares on May 3, before costs. Indeed, research seems to support this observation. In a 2015 study on insider trades, researchers Josef Laksonishok and Inmoo Lee in the US noted that one reason why observing insider trades is so fruitful is that senior officers and directors are more knowledgeable about the company's direction than the investing public. What is also interesting is their observation that while purchases by insiders may flag "buy" signals, their sales may not offer a significant "sell" signal. They said: "Insiders have many reasons to sell shares but the main reason to buy shares is to make money. Only insider purchases appear to be useful, while sales are not associated with low returns." As to why insider sales are not as good an indicator, they explained that in recent years, a higher percentage of managers' wealth is tied to their companies' stocks in the form of stock options and performance shares. And that could skew the "sell" signal, as a lot of the selling could be due to the managers diversifying their stock holdings - rather than any corporate-related activities. But the two researchers' most crucial observation is that, while following the lead of insiders can serve as a check on any analysis a person can make on a stock, it should never replace fundamental research. In this respect, one conspicuous example comes to mind - embattled commodities trader Noble Group. When the company came under attack by an anonymous blogger, Iceberg Research, over its accounting practices in early 2015, its founder and then chairman, Mr Richard Elman, had been quick to try to shore up investors' confidence with hefty purchases of Noble shares. Then, between June 2015 and August 2015, the company also spent $137.67 million buying back its own shares. Genting Singapore shares rebounded well above the highest the firm paid for its share buyback, rising 55 per cent in eight months. ST PHOTO: KUA CHEE SIONG GENTING SINGAPORE $78.12m Estimated cost of shares bought back in 2015. 92.17m Number of shares bought back. $107.4m Current estimated value. But even these massive share purchases failed to halt the stampede of investors out of its shares and its share price continued to plummet. So what are we to make of these examples? In hindsight, both JPMorgan and DBS are healthy businesses and what happened early last year was that their shares had been sold off heavily against the backdrop of a wider stock market turmoil. In Noble's case, however, the company was being hobbled by a ferocious downturn in the commodities market just as Iceberg put the spotlight on its accounting practices that, in turn, focused investors' attention on whether the company could service its large debt burden. Therefore, it is important for investors to note that they should not blindly follow insiders in their trades, and not to get carried away by blockbuster insider transactions which may be aimed at catching the market's attention. Having said that, it is still important to track what insiders are doing with their shares. After all, they have access to information not known to the public - and this will, no doubt, have a bearing on when they buy or sell their company's shares.

Morgan Chase & Co. is trying to spread the word about the bank's $150 million investment in Detroit's revitalization in national advertising. Since announcing a $50 million investment increase, the New York-based bank has promoted its philanthropy and investment in newsletters from political websites Axios.com and Politico.com. One ad in Axios AM even featured a picture of Mayor Mike Duggan. A recurring Chase ad in Politico Playbook boasts: "Detroit is a case study for how the private sector can collaborate with government and community leaders to drive change." On Thursday, an ad in the Axios newsletter featured Detroit lettering artist Joseph Alessio, linking to a video of Alessio creating a wall illustration of the bank's investment lending and grants in the city. "The more we can spread that message in and outside of Detroit, the better it is for others who are looking to take some of those lessons from Detroit and apply them to their challenges — or others who are thinking about investing in Detroit," bank spokesman Steve O'Halloran said.

But ultimately, the episode was set in motion elsewhere – on Wall Street. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The pressure on United, American and other giants is only going to increase with the rise of ultra-low-cost carriers like Spirit, Frontier and Allegiant.  Photo: Tim Fadek Relentless pressure on corporate America is creating an increasingly Dickensian experience for many consumers as companies focus on maximising profit. And nowhere is the trend as stark as in the airline industry, whose service is delivered in an aluminum tube packed with up to four different classes, cheek by jowl, 35,000 feet in the air. "There's always been pressure from Wall Street," says Robert Dilenschneider, a veteran public relations executive who advises companies and chief executives on strategic communications. "But I've been watching this for 30 years, and it's never been as intense as it is today." Rich bonus packages for top executives are now largely tied to short-term income targets and fatter profit margins instead of customer service. Of course, bolstering profits and in turn, stock prices has always been a big part of management's responsibility to shareholders, but making it virtually the only criterion for executive pay is new. Five years ago, American Airlines factored in on-time arrivals, lost baggage and consumer complaints to help calculate annual incentive payments for top management. Today, these bonuses are based exclusively on the company's pretax income and cost savings. Advertisement United has also scaled back bonuses linked to reliability and customer satisfaction for senior executives in recent years. But in the wake of what happened in April, bonuses "will be made more comprehensively subject to progress in 2017 on significant improvement in the customer experience," the company says in a financial filing. "Fifteen years ago, airlines competed with each other over who could buy the most planes or have the most routes," says Jamie Baker, a top airline industry analyst at JPMorgan Chase. "Executives are just as competitive today, but it's about who can achieve an investment-grade rating first, who can be a component in the S&P 500, and who has better returns for investors." These new incentives also partly explain why airlines are packing seats more densely and squeezing more passengers into the back of the plane. "Densification is driven by the desire to sweat the assets and generate revenues without having to commit capital to building new planes," Baker says. Such a shift isn't unique to the airline industry. "As in other industries, like manufacturing or consumer goods, the focus is on more traditional financial metrics like pretax income, margins, return on capital and total shareholder return," says Andrew Goldstein, head of the executive compensation practice in North America for Willis Towers Watson. "Airlines haven't abandoned operational and customer-service metrics, but they are putting less emphasis on those factors." Mature industry With the US economy growing at a rate of only 2 per cent while the stockmarket rallies on promises of soaring earnings, something must give so profit margins can grow. In the case of United or Spirit Airlines, whose repeated cancellations led to a melee among travellers this month at a terminal in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, it was customer service. At other companies, like Ford and Alcoa, it was the head of the chief executive that was served up when profits failed to meet expectations. Mature industries, where double-digit annual profit growth is a reach in the best of times, are especially vulnerable to activist investors' demands for board seats, bigger stock repurchases and other short-term financial rewards. The pressure is especially brutal in the airline industry because the key expense, fuel, is for the most part beyond management control. Yet airline executives have largely convinced Wall Street that the bad old days of bankruptcies and fare wars are over, replaced by the kind of predictable annual profits more common among industrial companies. That's among the reasons fees have popped up in recent years for everything from checking bags to securing an assigned seat before boarding. Known on Wall Street as ancillary revenue, this stream of income is especially favoured by investors because it doesn't swing sharply the way fares do. And so far, despite occasional bouts of air rage and frequent consumer complaints, Wall Street has been getting what it wants. United's stock has surged to more than $US80 per share from $US25 per share five years ago, with profit margins rising to 13.6 per cent from 3.7 per cent over the same period. Overall industry margins hit 16.3 per cent, up from 5.2 per cent in 2012. Spirit's operating margins are among the highest in the industry, topping 20 per cent in 2015 and 2016. But Paul Berry, a company spokesman, says Spirit had pivoted to focus more on customer service in the last year, even as some larger rivals keep cutting costs to compete. Despite rewarding top executives strictly according to financial targets, American says it, too, is committed to improving the passenger experience. "Every single person at American knows we succeed or fail based on how well we serve customers," says Joshua Freed, a company spokesman. "We will only meet those financial goals if we keep our customers happy." Still, the promise of steady profit growth has prompted even Warren Buffett to take a fresh look at airline stocks. He once famously called the industry a money-losing "death trap", but reversed course late last year, with his company, Berkshire Hathaway, acquiring stakes in several airlines. "In the past, airline stocks were seen as hazardous to one's wealth," says Baker, the JPMorgan analyst. "They were trading vehicles, and potential destroyers of capital." Increasing pressure The pressure on United, American and other giants is only going to increase with the rise of ultra-low-cost carriers like Spirit, Frontier and Allegiant. In fact, American and United are rolling out a stripped-down new class called Basic Economy. Here, in exchange for the cheapest tickets, fliers can't choose their seats before checking in and are more likely to be stuck in the middle of the row. They board last and are less likely to be able to sit with companions. No carry-on luggage is permitted, forcing anyone without elite frequent-flier status to check anything larger than a backpack for a fee. "That's the experience on an ultra-low-cost carrier," says Rajeev Lalwani, an airline industry analyst with Morgan Stanley. As the legacy airlines introduce similar no-frills offerings to hold off upstarts like Spirit, he says, "part of the idea is to get folks to upgrade to premium economy and collect fees". It's also the wave of the future, at least for budget-conscious travellers. "For the lowest price comes the most basic product," says Alan Wise, a senior partner with the Boston Consulting Group, who leads the firm's travel and tourism practice for North America. "Spirit has been a growth story in the space, and it's forced the legacy carriers to adapt and innovate." To be sure, some industry veterans insist it is a mistake to simply blame investors or hedge-fund managers for fostering a race to the bottom in customer service. "The response isn't to Wall Street. It's to customer behaviour," says Alex Dichter, a senior partner at McKinsey who works with major airlines. "About 35 per cent of customers are choosing on price, and price alone, and another 35 per cent choose mostly on price." Dichter notes that when American added 5-10 centimetres  of leg room in economy in the early 2000s, "as far as I know, the airline didn't see one bit of improvement in market share or pricing. "The great irony is that most CEOs would love to compete on product and experience," he adds. "It's much more fun. The problem is that customers aren't paying attention to that." - New York Times How bonuses work for Australian airline executives  At Qantas, chief executive Alan Joyce gets 33 per cent of his potential pay as a fixed base salary ($2.1 million), 40 per cent from short-term incentives and 27 per cent from long-term incentives. He received full short-term and long-term bonuses in 2015-16 for a total package worth $12.9 million.  Qantas' short-term incentives are weighted across five categories: 50 per cent for underlying pre-tax profit, 20 per cent on achieving the Qantas transformation program, and 10 per cent each for safety, customer satisfaction, and growth and strategy.  At Virgin just 20 per cent of the chief executive's remuneration is fixed, 30 per cent is short-term incentives and 50 per cent is long-term incentives. Other senior executives have 25 per cent of pay fixed, and the remainder split between short-term and long-term incentives.  The short-term incentive scorecard for the CEO is 50 per cent profit, 25 per cent return on investment, 7.5 per cent each on employee and customer satisfaction and 10 per cent on safety.  Other senior executives are weighted less towards profit and more towards operational matters.  Long-term bonuses are based entirely on the return on invested capital over three years, at the board's discretion.  - Lucy Battersby Originally published on The Sydney Morning Herald as Route to air travel discomfort starts on Wall Street.

Popular, with a balance sheet still groaning under the weight of toxic property assets, is a throwback to the boom-to-bust cycle that forced Spain to seek a bailout for its banking industry in 2012. A potential sale of Popular would hand its competitors the chance to buy a bank with a strong franchise in lending to small and medium-sized businesses. It also would allow the government to claim that Spain’s banking clean-up is finally complete. 1. Why is Popular so unpopular? Short answer: real estate. Popular’s woes stem from the loans it made in the years before a housing crash pitched the economy into a five-year slump starting in 2008. Founded in 1926, Popular had prided itself on efficient management that made it one of the world’s most profitable banks. That story started to sour in 2007 as confidence in Spanish real estate ebbed away; Popular’s shares began a long slide from their peak to lose 98 percent of their value. Popular shunned the chance to take state aid in 2012, when a stress test uncovered a capital shortfall. Instead, it embarked on a series of share sales that so far have raised 5.5 billion euros. Angel Ron, who had run Popular as chairman since 2004, left the bank earlier this year to make way for Emilio Saracho, a former JPMorgan Chase & Co. vice-chairman charged with stemming losses and fixing its balance sheet. 2. Is a sale the likely next step? Nobody knows for sure. Saracho told shareholders in April that the bank would need to raise more capital, with another option being a corporate transaction. Popular said earlier this month that some banks had expressed interest in combining businesses and that it had asked competitors to say whether they’d be interested in buying it. The bank says no final decision has been made about a sale versus other ways to raise money. 3. Who could buy Popular? Banco Santander SA has hired Citigroup Inc. to analyse a purchase, people familiar with the plans said this month, while Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA is working with Rothschild to analyze the deal, according to newspaper Expansion. Economy Minister Luis de Guindos has said that Bankia SA, which is state-owned after being bailed out in 2012, is also looking. 4. What obstacles are there to a sale? The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up Despite years of taking charges to cover real-estate losses, the lender’s attempts to mop up all the soured assets are far from complete. It still has 37 billion euros of non-performing assets, booked a 3.6 billion-euro loss in 2016 and a further 137 million euros loss in the first quarter. Any bank that buys Popular would itself have to raise a lot of capital to absorb it. Societe Generale SA said in a report that Santander would need 12.5 billion euros, BBVA 9.3 billion euros and CaixaBank SA 7.5 billion euros. At 7.33 percent, Popular’s fully-loaded CET1 ratio, a measure of solvency, is one of the weakest in Western Europe. 5. Is there any urgency? There could be. The bank said its first-quarter results, published May 5, showed only a modest 1 percent drop in customer deposits. Even so, Popular’s plight has generated plenty of headlines in the Spanish press since then, perhaps unnerving customers. The bank and its advisers may want to try to resolve its future before Spain’s long August break. A coupon payment on Popular’s riskiest bonds due in July is another focus of attention for investors. The bank has said it will make the payment as scheduled. It will cost about 30 million euros, based on Bloomberg data. 6. What’s attractive about Popular? It has about 34 billion euros of performing loans to small and medium-sized enterprises, a high-margin business based on carefully crafted personal relationships. And who doesn’t like a bank with a bit of mystery to it? Popular is well-known in Spain for having close links to the Roman Catholic organization Opus Dei. The bank itself doesn’t say much on the subject. However, when Luis Valls, a former co-chairman Popular died in 2006, the lender said he had been a member. The Reference Shelf A Bloomberg story on Banco Popular’s uncertain fate.

Let's say you live near Spalding University and want to run a few errands in the NuLu neighborhood this Saturday. Rather than driving your car and spending money on gas and parking, you can now rent a bicycle from a LouVelo station located on Breckenridge St. between Third and Fourth streets and enjoy a short ride to your destination. Your bicycle is a solid frame, three speed — decked out with fenders, a bell, puncture resistant tires, an adjustable seat, storage basket and a lock to keep your bike safe while you drop in at Revelry Gallery Boutique or grab a coffee at Please and Thank You. You've managed to run all your errands and get some fresh air — for $3.50. How? A network of nearly 30 LouVelo bicycle sharing stations are now operational and placed strategically throughout downtown Louisville, NuLu, Old Louisville and Butchertown, to make your riding dreams come true. The program — five years in the making — was officially launched during a Thursday morning press conference with Mayor Greg Fischer. Much of the delay in getting a bike sharing program to Louisville was due to trouble finding sponsors to finance the program. Fischer previously told The Courier-Journal that nine local entities will provide $10,000 to $20,000 apiece for each of the next three years — Norton Healthcare, JP Morgan Chase, UPS, Genscape, the Brown Hotel, KentuckyOne Health, Atria Senior Living, The Eye Care Institute and a group called Clay & Main. Annual operations are expected to cost the city about $50,000 a year. That is the base sum it has contracted to pay a Florida-based consultant, CycleHop, to manage the program. But what will it cost you? First, you need a credit card to rent a bicycle and participate in any of the daily, monthly or annual bike pass rental programs. Pricing is $3.50 per 30-minute trip or $15 per month for unlimited 60-minute trips. Annually, the LouVelo program cost is $10 a month with unlimited 60-minutes rides. So what's the keep people from just riding off with a bike? If a bike isn't returned in a certain amount of time, your credit card will get whacked for over $1,000. Definitely not worth it, so make sure you get that bike back to a docking station before you wander off. (A green light on the station illuminates when your bicycle has been securely returned.) The time constraints also keep the bicycles in play for everyone to enjoy. If you keep the bike longer than the allotted time allowed by your rental package, your credit card is charged $3.50 for each additional 30 minutes. Just like renting a movie from Redbox, you are under no obligation to return your bike back to the same kiosk where it was originally rented. Bikes can be picked up and returned to any of the 27 docking stations in the city. And don't worry about riding at night. There are front and back lights built into each bicycle, which are powered as you pedal. LouVelo stations will have bikes available 24/7. The bikes are equipped with passive GPS, so you can follow your routes, track your average speed and keep track of your calories burned through your account on the LouVelo website. "We're going to see more people have more options for transportation that wasn't there before," said Matthew Glaser, LouVelo general manager. Of the 305 green and black bicycles designed specifically for Louisville, five bikes are red — a tribute to Louisville's own Muhammad Ali. The story goes, that as a young boy his red bicycle was stolen and he wanted to learn to box to get that bike back. Dave Nelson, CycleHop's chief operating officer, previously told The Courier-Journal that Louisville is one of about 100 North American cities and at least 1,000 communities worldwide that have bike-sharing programs. The program will reduce carbon emissions and traffic congestion, introduce a popular alternative form of transportation and promote healthy living, he said. CycleHop runs bike-sharing programs in about 15 cities, from Florida to California and Canada. In total, the Louisville program has 28 stations and 305 bicycles. One station remains in storage as a backup and 27 stations are ready for public use. To see a full list of stations, visit www.LouVelo.com. "For me, I think one of the best advantages is being able to park your car and keep it there, but still bike out for errands and lunch," Glaser said Wednesday as he removed a shipping sticker from one of the new bikes being placed in a docking station. "Bikeshare and local business seem to go hand-in-hand, so I think it fits our local culture and dedication to keeping Louisville unique." Ready to ride? Customers can purchase rides at kiosks at the 27 docking stations or online at www.LouVelo.com. You can also book your trip on the Transit App. Once you've paid, unlock the bike with a code or membership card and away you go.

Let's say you live near Spalding University and want to run a few errands in the NuLu neighborhood this Saturday. Rather than driving your car and spending money on gas and parking, you can now rent a bicycle from a LouVelo station located on Breckenridge St. between Third and Fourth streets and enjoy a short ride to your destination. Your bicycle is a solid frame, three speed — decked out with fenders, a bell, puncture resistant tires, an adjustable seat, storage basket and a lock to keep your bike safe while you drop in at Revelry Gallery Boutique or grab a coffee at Please and Thank You. You've managed to run all your errands and get some fresh air — for $3.50. How? A network of nearly 30 LouVelo bicycle sharing stations are now operational and placed strategically throughout downtown Louisville, NuLu, Old Louisville and Butchertown, to make your riding dreams come true. The program — five years in the making — was officially launched during a Thursday morning press conference with Mayor Greg Fischer. Much of the delay in getting a bike sharing program to Louisville was due to trouble finding sponsors to finance the program. Fischer previously told The Courier-Journal that nine local entities will provide $10,000 to $20,000 apiece for each of the next three years — Norton Healthcare, JP Morgan Chase, UPS, Genscape, the Brown Hotel, KentuckyOne Health, Atria Senior Living, The Eye Care Institute and a group called Clay & Main. Annual operations are expected to cost the city about $50,000 a year. That is the base sum it has contracted to pay a Florida-based consultant, CycleHop, to manage the program. But what will it cost you? First, you need a credit card to rent a bicycle and participate in any of the daily, monthly or annual bike pass rental programs. Pricing is $3.50 per 30-minute trip or $15 per month for unlimited 60-minute trips. Annually, the LouVelo program cost is $10 a month with unlimited 60-minutes rides. So what's the keep people from just riding off with a bike? If a bike isn't returned in a certain amount of time, your credit card will get whacked for over $1,000. Definitely not worth it, so make sure you get that bike back to a docking station before you wander off. (A green light on the station illuminates when your bicycle has been securely returned.) The time constraints also keep the bicycles in play for everyone to enjoy. If you keep the bike longer than the allotted time allowed by your rental package, your credit card is charged $3.50 for each additional 30 minutes. Just like renting a movie from Redbox, you are under no obligation to return your bike back to the same kiosk where it was originally rented. Bikes can be picked up and returned to any of the 27 docking stations in the city. And don't worry about riding at night. There are front and back lights built into each bicycle, which are powered as you pedal. LouVelo stations will have bikes available 24/7. The bikes are equipped with passive GPS, so you can follow your routes, track your average speed and keep track of your calories burned through your account on the LouVelo website. "We're going to see more people have more options for transportation that wasn't there before," said Matthew Glaser, LouVelo general manager. Of the 305 green and black bicycles designed specifically for Louisville, five bikes are red — a tribute to Louisville's own Muhammad Ali. The story goes, that as a young boy his red bicycle was stolen and he wanted to learn to box to get that bike back. Dave Nelson, CycleHop's chief operating officer, previously told The Courier-Journal that Louisville is one of about 100 North American cities and at least 1,000 communities worldwide that have bike-sharing programs. The program will reduce carbon emissions and traffic congestion, introduce a popular alternative form of transportation and promote healthy living, he said. CycleHop runs bike-sharing programs in about 15 cities, from Florida to California and Canada. In total, the Louisville program has 28 stations and 305 bicycles. One station remains in storage as a backup and 27 stations are ready for public use. To see a full list of stations, visit www.LouVelo.com. "For me, I think one of the best advantages is being able to park your car and keep it there, but still bike out for errands and lunch," Glaser said Wednesday as he removed a shipping sticker from one of the new bikes being placed in a docking station. "Bikeshare and local business seem to go hand-in-hand, so I think it fits our local culture and dedication to keeping Louisville unique." Ready to ride? Customers can purchase rides at kiosks at the 27 docking stations or online at www.LouVelo.com. You can also book your trip on the Transit App. Once you've paid, unlock the bike with a code or membership card and away you go.

Bloomberg iStock Citigroup Inc. doesn’t think its richer customers will drop their high-priced money managers in favour of automated investing, but Betterment LLC is betting it can prove the big bank wrong. The robo-advisor—the largest among independent digital advice startups that popped up after the 2008 financial collapse—has overhauled its entire brand. The shift in marketing and advertising strategy is aimed at attracting more affluent customers just now becoming aware of the option. It’s also not a coincidence that Betterment’s pivot comes as more traditional players such as Vanguard Group Inc., Charles Schwab Corp., and even JPMorgan Chase & Co. are starting to use more technology when offering investment advice. In other words, the robo-advisor pie is about to expand, and Betterment wants to make sure it gets a bigger piece. “These are fundamental decisions about who we are as a company,” founder and chief executive officer Jon Stein said in an interview.  “We’re attracting a lot of affluent customers already, but I think our voice—as we speak to that person—has to show we are established,” he said. Late last year, Citigroup, which has invested in Betterment through its venture capital arm, sent clients a research report voicing scepticism about just how large assets under management could grow for robo-advisors when it comes to wealthier individuals. “Higher net-worth or more sophisticated investors will, in our view, always demand face-to-face advice,” wrote Citi analysts led by Ronit Ghose. But Betterment says that’s not the case, explaining it already has a number of customers with more than $10 million under management each. On top of its redesign, the firm is thinking about adding access to more exclusive products. “People do want access to alternatives, and that’s something we see demand for among the mass affluent,” Stein said. Betterment doesn’t disclose how many of its accounts are held by accredited investors (who would be allowed by regulators to participate in complex investments such as hedge funds, venture capital, or private equity) but said it’s well more than 25,000 of its 250,000 customers. Some on Wall Street are already moving to stake a claim. Although JPMorgan chief executive officer Jamie Dimon didn’t say last year how much money the bank has put into building its robo-advisor, he did say roughly $600 million was devoted to “emerging fintech solutions” and that technology is an extremely important part of the company’s future strategies. For Betterment, this is the second big change in 2017. Earlier this year it introduced a new fee structure and added more certified advisers, also in an attempt to draw in wealthy customers as well as younger individuals who will have major financial decisions to make in the next 5 to 10 years, such as buying a home. While affluent individuals are a big part of this new push, the firm said its mission is still to attract people spanning the financial spectrum, and that was a part of the research process that went into the redesign. “We looked at people across the range in age and income,” said Elyssa Gray, vice president in charge of brand at Betterment. “Regardless of the level of experience or the amount of money they had, there were a number of common denominators when it comes to financial services.” A big part of that was taking out financial jargon which, the firm said, irked some customers. “We heard over and over again: ‘Start talking to us like a person,’” said Sarah Kaufman, director of brand and content. “It’s really about how we are telling this story, too, not just the design.” Bloomberg Topics: Wall Street fund manager investing HNI More From Livemint READ MORE World Bank sees improving global economy but risks remain Theresa May spars with Jeremy Corbyn on terrorism as UK election nears climax RCom shares rise nearly 5% after debt deal with lenders First Published: Mon, May 29 2017. 05 03 PM IST Editor's Picks Currency ban: The politics vs the economics Are nationalized banks the walking dead of the Indian banking system? $120 million-plus brand value just numbers for me: Virat Kohli Latest News World Bank sees improving global economy but risks remain Theresa May spars with Jeremy Corbyn on terrorism as UK election nears climax RCom shares rise nearly 5% after debt deal with lenders Vladimir Putin dismisses US claims about Trump, Russia and elections Donald Trump may not block James Comey testimony at key public hearing Mint On Sunday The best food of Delhi’s state bhawans When parents step in to run schools The defenders of the skies of Roland Garros Beneath the beauty, Mauritius is an archive of human struggle and triumph The elusiveness of silence Home Companies Opinion Industry Politics Consumer Lounge Multimedia Money Sitemap Subscribe Contact Us Mint Code Privacy policy Terms of Use Advertising Mint Apps About Us Syndication Mint on Sunday RSS Hindustan Times Desimartini Copyright © 2017 HT Media Ltd.

Senior management of SABB and Alawwal held talks with advisers on Sunday to discuss the principle of the merger and timeframe for its completion, one of the sources said. SABB has selected another, undisclosed adviser for the transaction, the sources added. Nobody was available to comment at Alawwal, while SABB and JPMorgan declined to comment. SABB and Alawwal said on April 25 they had agreed to start talks on a merger that could create the kingdom's third biggest bank with assets of nearly $80 billion. British banks are the biggest shareholders in both lenders. RBS acquired a 40 percent stake in Alawwal when it bought ABN AMRO in 2007. RBS has been trying sell the stake for a number of years as it retreats from international operations. HSBC Holdings (HSBA.L) owns 40 percent of SABB, which is the kingdom's sixth largest bank by assets. Although the timeframe for the merger has yet to be agreed, one of the sources said the accounts of the two banks could be consolidated by the end of 2017, but the merger would take longer. Mergers and acquisitions are relatively rare in Saudi Arabia's banking sector, where 12 local commercial lenders operate. Reuters reported in March, quoting sources, that French bank Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA) had picked JPMorgan to advise it on a potential sale of its 31 percent stake in Banque Saudi Fransi 1050.SE, valued at nearly $2.4 billion.

Moneycontrol News Tech Mahindra lost nearly 17 percent intraday on Monday as investors reacted negatively to the company’s results. The stock was at its 43-month low The IT services major posted a consolidated net profit for the March quarter at Rs 589.7 crore, a fall of 30.2 percent against Rs 845 crore quarter on quarter. A poll of analysts by CNBC-TV18 had pegged the net profit at Rs 788 crore. The company’s consolidated rupee revenue came in around a percent lower at Rs 7,495 crore against Rs 7,557.5 crore QoQ. Meanwhile, its dollar revenue came in higher by over a percent at USD 1,131.2 million against USD 1,116.1 million posted during the previous quarter. The stock has shown weak movements, falling 15 percent in the past one month, while its three-day loss was seen at 13 percent. At 09:19 hrs Tech Mahindra was quoting at Rs 364.20, down Rs 65.15, or 15.17 percent on the BSE. It touched a 52-week low of Rs 363.10. Brokerages too had a negative outlook on the stock. A look at what top analysts are talking about the stock. Brokerage: JPMorgan | Rating: Neutral | Target: Rs 410 JPMorgan said that the company’s near term outlook on margins seems uncertain and any sign of improvement in it will be evident only in second half of this fiscal. Further, it added that there is a need to see how the firm plans to address its profitability. Brokerage: Morgan Stanley | Rating: Equalweight | Target: Rs 455The global investment bank believes that a margin miss in the fourth quarter is driving the sharp cut in earnings per share (EPS) estimates. In fact, a recovery in margin is likely to be only gradual. On the estimates, it feels that steep cut in estimates would be reflected in the stock price. A sharp correction in the stock may offer opportunity for long-term investors, the brokerage added. tags #Buzzing Stocks #Tech Mahindra Related news Business GST Impact: Jewellery stocks surge 6-10% as govt sets 3% rate on gold Jun 05, 2017 09:03 AM Business Axiscades Engineering shares rally 10% on joint venture with France firm Jun 02, 2017 03:31 PM Business Bayer CropScience soars 11%, crosses Rs 5,000-mark on share buyback proposal Jun 02, 2017 03:11 PM Business Tata Motors gains 2% on consistent growth in Jaguar, passenger vehicle sales Jun 02, 2017 12:53 PM Business Top buzzing midcap stocks to trade on June 2 Jun 02, 2017 12:32 PM Business GMR Infra soars 14% after FY17 debt drops 47%, operational performance strong Jun 02, 2017 10:59 AM Business Bharti Airtel rallies over 3% on securing SEBI, exchanges' nod for Telenor India buyout Jun 02, 2017 10:16 AM Business Cadila Health hits record high, up 7% on USFDA nod for antibiotic Levofloxacin Jun 02, 2017 10:06 AM Business Reliance Communications falls 2% post Fitch downgrades Jun 02, 2017 09:44 AM News Most Popular Top News How Ravi Narain built the NSE, and then lost his grip Book profits @ 9700 on Nifty; 5 stocks which can return up to 14% in short term Wipro chief Azim Premji took home 63% less salary, zero commission in FY17 What green initiatives are banks taking towards climate change?

Analysts say cash brought back could be a piggy bank for company stock repurchases or acquisitions. Problem is, President Trump's economic agenda has been stalled amid White House drama. The proposed changes on "repatriated" cash are part of a bigger Trump tax reform package. Randall Stephenson, AT&T's (T) CEO, says tax reform can make it through Congress. "A lot of people are getting pessimistic because of a lot of the noise in Washington right now that tax reform may not be achieved," Stephenson said at a JPMorgan tech conference on May 23. "I am still optimistic something can still get done … bundling tax reform with an infrastructure bill would be big. I think it's achievable." Even so, one worry is that the overseas "tax holiday" for tech firms may not turn out as the bonanza it's made out to be. That depends on whether legislation puts conditions on how money could be spent and creates enforcement mechanisms. Rather than see the money go toward company stock buybacks or acquisitions, Trump and Congress could steer money toward job creation and capital spending, says a UBS analyst. "If the (Trump administration) wants to really drive inward investments within the U.S. there might have to be some sort of mandated use of cash, maybe to spend it on (capital expenditures). As yet, we do not know," UBS analyst Geoff Robinson said in a report. There's reason to think Robinson might be on the right track. "There's trillions of dollars offshore. We want to get that back into America," Gary Cohn, Trump's chief economic advisor, said in a recent interview. "We want the companies to bring the money back and put it back into the economy. We want them to create jobs." Cash-rich tech companies like Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Cisco currently would pay a 35% tax on so-called "repatriated earnings." Rather than take the tax hit, they've kept the money overseas. President Trump has proposed a one-time tax of 10% on offshore earnings while the Republican-controlled House has proposed a lower 8.5% rate. The overseas tax-break that Congress passed in 2004 was called the American Jobs Creation Act, but didn't do much to stimulate the economy, analysts say. The AJCA taxed repatriated earnings at a 5.25% rate. The top five firms in bringing back cash in 2004 were drug companies Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK), as well as Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and IBM (IBM). According to the IRS, $312 billion was brought back in all. However, only 10% of companies eligible to bring back cash in 2004 did so, says Richard Lane, an analyst at Moody's Investor Service. Many companies kept cash overseas because of AJCA requirements, he said. The AJCA required companies to reinvest tax savings in worker hiring and training, infrastructure, research and development and capital projects. According to UBS, however, "Funds in 2004's repatriation may have been earmarked for capital investment but ultimately were spent in large part on share repurchases." UBS says that happened because the AJCA did not include a "tracking mechanism" so the government could audit companies and gauge compliance. The Trump administration could put better enforcement mechanisms in place. S&P 500 companies have more than $2.6 trillion in overseas cash. Some of that may be needed to continue funding foreign operations. The companies currently with the most overseas cash are Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, Google and Oracle (ORCL), Moody's says. While Cisco has stated any cash brought back to the U.S. could be used for reducing debt on its books, analysts have other ideas. If a tax holiday is approved, BMO Capital Markets said in a report that it "expects Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to focus more on acquisitions, while Apple and smaller companies would likely lean more toward capital return." In the case of Apple and Cisco, some analysts envision enough cash being brought back to fund "transformative" deals. Apple has about $250 billion in cash, growing at about $50 billion a year. About 90% of Apple's cash is overseas. A one-time, 10% repatriation tax would give Apple some $220 billion for acquisitions or buybacks, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a report. Suva speculated that Apple could buy large companies such as Netflix (NFLX), Walt Disney (DIS) or Electronic Arts (EA). Cisco, meanwhile, could bring back up to $56 billion in cash from overseas, analysts say. In a report, Credit Suisse speculates that enterprise software providers ServiceNow (NOW), Splunk (SPLK), or computer security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW) could be on Cisco's shopping list. Pacific Crest Securities adds Red Hat (RHT) and Nutanix (NTNX) to the list of possible Cisco targets. Intel (INTC) is among semiconductor companies with a cash hoard overseas. Intel could bring back about $12 billion, says BMO Capital Markets. Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also have significant overseas cash. But, BMO Capital does not expect a Trump tax holiday to spur an acquisition spree among chipmakers.

Argentina is also a frontier market fairy tale! Matein Khalid/Dubai Filed on May 28, 2017 | Last updated on May 28, 2017 at 07.59 pm Share More > Vote Brazil's Bovespa endured a roller-coaster ride in the last year. (AFP) Any hit in Brazil is a chance for UAE investors to accumulate Argentina shares Brazil's Bovespa index, the real and its sovereign debt have plunged and soared in the last year in response to its political news flow rollercoaster. The resignation of Dilma Rousseff triggered Latin America's most-frenzied bull market in the real and the Bovespa in 2016. Now President Michel Temer's systemic bribery allegations gutted Brazil's financial markets. I was horrified to see the iShares Brazil country index fund tank 17 per cent in a single trading session while the Sao Paulo Borsa shut down. It is impossible to pontificate on Brazil as its latest sordid political drama plays out other than to reiterate my old Victorian surgeon's motto: when in doubt, cut it out! Ever since the Mexican peso devaluation of 1994, I learnt the hard way that cross-border contagion is an existential reality in Latin America. When financial Black Death hits the region, fund managers in Gringolandia do not sell what they want, they sell what they can as cross-asset margin calls cascade. So it did not surprise me to see my favourite Latin American stock market since late 2015, Argentina, get slammed in the Brazilian meltdown. However, any hit in Brazil is a chance for UAE investors to accumulate Argentina, my frontier market fairy tale along with Pakistan. Why? One, political stability is as valuable as it is ephemeral in the Third World (now politely known as 'emerging markets'!). President Mauricio Macri is a pro-market reformer committed to economic globalisation who ended 12 years of Peronist socialist misrule under President Néstor Kirchner and his wife Cristina Fernández. The Argentine right, haunted by the memories of the sala guerra, the tragic dirty war under military dictator generals Viola, Videla and Galtieri, has embraced a moderate reformer and a team of ex-JPMorgan Chase technocrats in the Casa Rosada. Hola amigos! Two, Macri has not just talked the talk but walked the walk. He devalued the Argentina peso and abolished currency controls. He settled with Paris Club holdout creditors and guided Argentina's return to the global capital markets with a wildly-successful Eurobond in April 2016, up 12 points after I recommended it in this column as a must own US dollar new issue. Thanks to Macri's reforms, Argentina has now issued $30 billion in foreign debt, a stellar track record for a nation that once precipitated history's biggest sovereign default in 2001. Even Eva Perón in the Recoleta would be proud of the Argentina of 2017! Three, since BP Securities in Buenos Aires is chaired by my old Chase training class hermano Alejandro Allende, I have impeccable insights into the Argentina money game. Alex told me on the eve of Macri's election that Argentine banks could be triple baggers under the new regime. Hence I was able to gift my readers Banco Macro ADR's in New York, up 200 per cent-plus since Macri's election. As I still tell my dad, if you think Wharton's expensive, try ignorance! For Gulf investors still skeptical about Argentina, note that the Merval is up 48 per cent in the last twelve months. 2016 was the year to do the Tango Argentino on the Rio Plata! Four, Pakistan has been upgraded to emerging market by Morgan Stanley Capital International. Argentina is next. Stay tuned while I scan the smoke signals at MSCI. Five, Argentina still faces monumental economic issues, a legacy of the failed Peronist decade and the hyperinflationary debt crises of the 1990s. Inflation is an awful 24 per cent. The Peronistas and the hard left, the voice of the gauchos and the descamisados (poor), are still powerful in Congress. Macro's 3.5 per cent of GDP fiscal deficit target seems unrealistic in 2017. Argentina is Brazil's largest trading partner and vulnerable to Chinese appetite for soft commodities and meat from the pampas. Yet as George Soros advised, the big money is often made when things go from Godawful to just plain awful. Greek equities were leprosy for me since 2010, when Athens near defaulted on its sovereign debt. However, after a Great Depression scale economic slump and epic labour/pension/fiscal reforms, bailouts, the IMF, EU and Berlin have led to another emerging market Cinderella. In my youth, the Akti Meoli in Piraeus and the Grande Bretagne in Syntagma Square were my banker hangouts - plus Mykonos. It is time to return to the Hellenic morning of creation in the Greek isles!

Price: ₹599 A ringside view of the closed society of financial elites and how they control the world May 28, 2017:   Sandra Navidi’s curriculum vitae looks richly speckled. She studied law and practised in Germany and the US. She was an investment banker and, later, a macroeconomic analyst who worked with economist Nouriel Roubini. If you remember, Roubini had predicted the collapse of the housing market and the worldwide recession of 2008. Navidi is now a management consultant advising a myriad mix of companies and people who run it. Obviously, having attended exclusive invite-only big-ticket events in the world of finance and the economy, she has had access to troves of exclusive information lesser mortals are not necessarily privy to. So, obviously, one expects Navidi’s Superhubs: How the Financial Elite and Their Networks Rule Our World to be an eye-opening treatise on the murky, complex and chaotic universe of global finance and its dubious hubs and networks. But at the very outset Navidi makes it clear that she is no radical rabble-rouser. Instead, she is a neutral chronicler and the judgment is left to the readers, who have a lot to read between the lines in this refreshingly detailed work on 21st century finance. The hyper-networkers Physicist Stephen Hawking called 21st century a period of complexity. For Navidi, three forces propel this complex period: technologisation, financialisation and globalisation. The world of finance is a deadly cocktail of all the three forces that mark this century. As a result, traditional methods and linear thinking become quite unsuccessful in understanding what happens in this system which is a web of alliances and networks in which the ‘power of networking’ plays a pivotal role, influencing global policies and business deals. In 12 chapters rich in research and sprinkled with personality profiles of the movers and shakers of finance, Navidi shows how people such as Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase; Larry Fink, chairman and CEO of Blackrock, the largest asset management company in the world; and billionaire hedge fund honcho George Soros “shape history, transform the world we live in, and determine the future of our financial system, economy, and society”. She helps unravel a curious world of power-brokering, while strictly maintaining her role as a neutral observer. But being neutral is a Herculean task while analysing the world of finance. At times, Navidi gets tempted to go judgemental, especially when she analyses the influential networks in finance. Over time, she writes, certain network dynamics — such as the “rich-get-richer phenomenon” and self-perpetuating feedback loops — will cause any system automatically to become more interconnected, homogeneous, and complex. She understands that this is not a great way to go because most systems are adaptive and self-correcting, so when they become “too lopsided, circuit-breaking feedback loops kick in, restabilising the system”. Systems that fail to correct themselves ultimately self-destruct, she warns. But this is a dog-eat-dog world anyway, where factors such as ethics and loyalty often get a back seat, as we have seen in the works of Michael Lewis, Sebastian Mallaby, or even Bryan Burrough and John Helyar. “You want loyalty, hire a cocker spaniel,” informs Lewis in his seminal work, Liar’s Poker, in which he shared his startling experience as a bond salesman on Wall Street. But Navidi doesn’t want you to enter that space, for obvious reasons. She is still active in the industry and if the litany of praise from the biggies of finance that dot the first few pages of Superhub is any indication, she has influential friends to humour. Circumspect narrative So, Navidi sticks to the essentials, which are enough for us to enjoy. She starts by profiling the Financial Universe, starting from the stratosphere of power — Davos, where meetings tangibly demonstrate that “similar people attract each other — and that those who already have the most connections attract even more”. Then she goes to look at the global financial system through the prism of network science. This, claims Navidi, provides a more structured explanation of how a select few get to the very centre of networks, where they become the so-called ‘superhubs’. There are plenty of successful people in the world, Navidi writes, but only a few become so “disproportionately successful” that they operate the very levers of the financial system; they form the superhub, which connects the influential to the more-influential. In the world of finance, netswork equals net worth. And what are the links that connect these networks? Money, information and opportunities. In finance, says Navidi, the most valuable currency is actionable information that can be converted into monetary gain. So, in essence, you’re worth what you know. Which also means, you’re what/who you’re connected to. Is this a virtue or a vice? Navidi sits on the fence here. Especially considering the plethora of examples that suggest how these powerful networks influence public policies across the globe, leading to considerable damage to public good. During the subprime crisis of 2007-08, most rating agencies were vying with each other to stamp high ratings to toxic bonds and other financial instruments, which eventually, nearly, pulled down the whole financial system in the US, triggering a chain reaction across the globe. In Navidi’s world, superhubs and their influence, though they can get toxic at times, are a necessary inevitability, whether you like it or not. This is where the book stumbles. Or differs from the likes of a Big Short (Lewis) or More Money Than God (Mallaby), which vehemently criticises the power of financial elites and their ill-gotten wealth. But as we can see Navidi seems to have great friends she cannot offend by revealing unpleasant truths. Navidi’s language at times gets too simple to bring out the nuances in the discourse. The book is text-bookish in places. But those are minor glitches; if you are interested in the world of finance and its curiosities, this is a good read.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 30 May 2017 Short just gets worse for Evergrande bears HONG KONG: China Evergrande Group’s astonishing share rally has resulted in the world’s most painful short trade this year. To add insult to injury, bearish investors are paying higher fees to get crushed. Fees to borrow shares of the Hong Kong-listed Chinese developer for shorting have surged by more than five times since January to about 10% and have doubled since Evergrande started buying back shares in late March, according to Simon Colvin, a London-based analyst at IHS Markit Ltd. Evergrande shares available for lending have “nearly all been spoken for,” Colvin wrote in an email, resulting in higher borrowing costs. Evergrande shares have more than tripled this year, hurting short-sellers and baffling even some of the most bullish stock analysts. Part of the sharp rally can be explained by Evergrande’s plan to raise money from strategic investors ahead of a planned backdoor listing on the mainland and speculation that the developer will benefit from rising home sales in smaller Chinese cities. A buy-back spree has also propelled a 123% jump since late March -- when short interest started climbing from a low point. “I wouldn’t recommend investors to short Evergrande because of the strong momentum. It’s too risky,” Raymond Cheng, Hong Kong-based analyst at CIMB Securities Ltd, said by phone. “The momentum will remain strong until the backdoor listing is completed and after that there might be some share price correction.” Evergrande soared as much as 27% to an all-time high yesterday, while peers such as Country Garden Holdings Co and Sunac China Holdings Ltd advanced more than 10%. The acceleration in gains is raising questions, with JPMorgan Chase & Co saying in a note received on Friday that Evergrande’s business model isn’t sustainable. The pressures on short-sellers are mounting as investors are covering their bearish positions, said Citigroup Inc analyst Oscar Choi, which could be contributing to higher demand for Evergrande shares. In a typical short sale, investors borrow shares and sell them with the expectation that the price will decline. In a successful trade, the investors later buy the shares back at a lower price to return to the lender, or cover the short, so they can pocket the difference. After yesterday’s rally, Evergrande’s share price increase is the biggest among major short targets worldwide, which include companies with a market value of at least US$1bil and short interest tracked by Markit of at least 10%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The only other wager that has inflicted pain of a similar magnitude is a bearish trade on Applied Optoelectronics Inc, whose shares advanced 205 % this year, the data show. Evergrande trades at a record 36 times reported earnings, more than double the valuations of Country Garden and Sunac, while Monday’s gain alone added US$5.3bil to its market value. Bearish bets accounted for 20.7% of its free float on May 25, according to IHS Market data, while its share price is 118% higher than consensus analyst estimates for the next 12 months. Some analysts are still optimistic. Morgan Stanley analyst John Lam, one of the most bullish analysts on Evergrande with an overweight rating on the shares, has a street high price target of HK$12, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Lam cited moves by Evergrande’s management to raise its second-round strategic investment target to 30 billion yuan from 15 billion yuan. Lam expects Evergrande to lower its net gearing to 237% by the end of this year, from 432% at the end of 2016, according to a May 23 note. Evergrande’s six-month financial results, which will be released in August, is another potential catalyst for the share price, according to Morgan Stanley.— Bloomberg   Tags / Keywords: Evergrande , shares , fees , investors Related Stories Related Stories AirAsia shares tumble S&P says Noble Group’s debt-load is unsustainable World’s most indebted developer battles short-sellers again Vietnam bank aims to fetch US$700mil Anzo shares plummet after tie-up announcement You May Be Interested Ringgit firmer vs US$, pound sterling early Monday The need to educate investors on ponzi and pyramid scheme Samsung Galaxy Tab S3: Sleek and stylish 5 superpowers every mum has 6 beautiful cities to add to your bucket list How to avoid dehydration during Ramadan Others Also Read A bigger Putrajaya Ramadan Festival Toyota-supported flying car hopes to light the Tokyo 2020 Olympic flame Williams set to face Lions, Perofeta gets first start Property Related advertisement Latest News A decent quarter with mixed results for banking sector Net foreign buying on Bursa crosses key RM10b Maybank IB feels the O&G sector has bottomed out Ringgit firmer vs US$, pound sterling early Monday KLCI wavers early Monday, key Asian markets mixed Most Viewed in Business Ringgit firmer vs US$, pound sterling early Monday Higher revenue for IRB Net foreign buying on Bursa crosses key RM10b Ng to take AIA to the next stage of growth A decent quarter with mixed results for banking sector Maybank IB feels the O&G sector has bottomed out Five golden rules for investing borrowed money Chinese billionaires clash over Alibaba’s parcel deliveries Affin Hwang Research sees Malaysian stock market in early stage rally My money mistakes advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

They will do so with soldiers patrolling outside Parliament in London, authorities warning that another attack is imminent and Prime Minister Theresa May cutting short her participation in the Group of Seven meeting in Sicily. With exactly two weeks to go until the June 8 election, it’s likely to be a different style of campaign. Attention will also soon be forced back toward the Brexit negotiations, now less than a month away. The good news? Bloomberg’s Ian Wishart sees signs of compromise emerging even after the harsh rhetoric of recent weeks. Some EU officials share that optimism. There are indications of flexibility from the EU over the bill it wants the UK to pay. Meanwhile, the British are implying a willingness to give ground on the financial settlement as well as on immigration and the power of EU judges. The question is whether enough common ground can be found. “Both sides will have to make some compromises – but we shouldn’t fool ourselves into thinking that it won’t mainly have to be the UK,” said Agata Gostynska-Jakubowska, research fellow at the Centre for European Reform in London. Security warning One area where there will need to be cooperation, especially after this week’s attack, is security, according to the official charged with overseeing Brexit for the Czech Republic. “Perhaps this is one of the events, no matter how tragic it is, that shows that Brexit is an unfortunate thing,” Jan Kral, acting secretary of state for EU affairs, said in an interview in Prague. “I’m convinced if not by goodwill then by necessity we will be forced to cooperate even more closely.” Failure to agree on security ties by the time of Brexit would risk the UK spinning out of Europol, which helps police fight crime across borders, and the European Arrest Warrant system, under which EU members transfer people sought by another.

Reliance on London The European Central Bank is pushing back against the idea that euro-area companies need the City of London to survive Brexit intact. In a new report, the central bank estimated that UK-domiciled banks supply just 1 per cent to 2 per cent of the euro-area private sector’s external financing. Launching the report, ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio said Brexit won’t “harm significantly” the euro area’s economic expansion and would prove “much less meaningful” than for the UK Bloomberg’s Brexit Barometer suggests the British have a reason to worry, with the indicator of economics health staying in “windy” territory for the first time since November. No deal not credible A collapse in the Brexit talks would be much more damaging for the UK economy than British officials suggest when they claim “no deal is better than a bad deal,” according to JPMorgan Chase economist Malcolm Barr. “The key to this is to understand that UK-based activity has adapted to the framework for trade facilitation that the EU has provided, and that the sudden removal of that framework without provision of a functioning replacement would be enormously disruptive to activity in the short run,” Barr told clients in a report this week. How big the shock would be to output is hard to estimate, he said. He noted a 2014 analysis that estimated a 20-day closure of West coast ports in the U.S. would cut 0.3 per cent off gross domestic product. “The impact of Brexit without an agreement would be orders of magnitude larger than these estimates,” Barr said, prompting him to question the credibility of the threat to walk away from the negotiations. Brexit round-up Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary says the UK could be locked out of EU air travel for six months without a deal   If May meets her goal of reducing immigration to the tens of thousands it could shrink the economy by as much as 3 per cent, the Centre for Economics and Business Research says The price of wine could rise by about a quarter after Brexit, according to the UK Trade Policy Observatory  The Lawyers for Britain group say they have “failed to find a credible legal argument” for a Brexit bill Britons are still hitting the shops but there is no guarantee they will keep doing so, writes Bloomberg Gadfly’s Andrea Felsted On the markets Currency traders see the pound emerging unscathed from the upcoming election even if May manages just a modest increase in her parliamentary majority.  While some betting markets and models have predicted that the Tories could land as many as 180 seats more than its rivals combined, even a 50-seat cushion may help sterling hold steady, analysts say. And finally… British academics specializing in archeology stand to lose the most from Brexit given they get 38 per cent of their funding from the EU, according to a report commissioned by the UK’s four national academies. Information technology, software engineering, media studies and the law are other fields which receive more than a quarter of their funding from EU research grants, the report found. Overall, 12 per cent of UK research money comes from the bloc, all of which will be at risk once Brexit occurs. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Malaysia Airlines close to deal for more widebody Airbus planes Pound falls after London terror attacks raise political tensions Ringgit opens higher against US dollar PBOC has economy's back even as it squeezes leverage from market Oil subdued as rising US output undermines Opec effort to cut supply Ringgit likely to trade higher versus US dollar next week RHB-AmBank to take No. 1 spot in asset management, insurance, broking Petronas Q1 2017 pre-tax profit more than doubles to RM15.5b British pound in thrall to election projections as market jitters rise Bursa to be firmer next week Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: With rave reviews, 'Wonder Woman' readies to launch Reuters Video: Francois Ozon's 'L'Amant Double' shocks at Cannes Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Manager of Singaporean-owned restaurant recounts London attack (VIDEO) Brutally simple attack leaves police in dark (VIDEO) Islamic State jihadists claim London stabbing rampage (VIDEO) Outrage as Trump targets London mayor over attacks (VIDEO) London diserang, MAS tawar pulangan tiket Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

Thanks for reading and your comments.        See you all again tomorrow morning from 9. 4:38pm on 30 May 2017 For those more graphically minded, here is a nice visual wrap of the day's ASX results:   4:34pm on 30 May 2017 Shares have enjoyed a solid turnaround, with the ASX rallying steadily from early losses to end the session in the black. The top 200 index enjoyed a 40-point rebound to end the session up 10 points, or 0.2 per cent, higher at 5718. The rally was powered by the big banks as investors showed they were prepared to step in and buy at the tail end of a dreadful May for the sector. CBA ended 0.7 per cent higher, ANZ was up 0.8 per cent, Westpac 1 per cent, and NAB 1.6 per cent. Macquarie climbed 0.8 per cent. Miners also enjoyed a change in fortunes: BHP added 0.7 per cent, Rio 1 per cent and Fortescue 1.9 per cent. Gold miners also gained, while energy lagged as Woodside dropped 1 per cent. Outside of miners and banks there was less joy to be had. Big names such as CSL, Wesfarmers and Telstra all dragged as they fell in the vicinity of 0.8 per cent. Metcash dropped 2 per cent as a number of consumer stocks felt the pinch: Retail Food Group was the day's worst with a 3 per cent fall, while carsales.com lost 2 per cent. Among the day's losers were also listed property names: Mirvac, Vicinity Centres and Stockland all dragged on the market. Winners and losers in the ASX 200 today. Photo: Bloomberg 3:56pm on 30 May 2017 Consumers are paying the price for the significant disruption to the Australian gas market as exporters scramble to meet their export commitments, the national energy regulator has warned. In its annual review of energy markets, the Australian Energy Regulator noted that newly completed export projects in Queensland had been expected to insulate the Victorian, and to a lesser extent, NSW markets. But it found that shortages faced by the Santos-backed Gladstone gas project had changed that. Victoria's gas producers, for example, are also selling gas into the export projects, shipping the gas north costs at around $3.50-$4 a gigajoule, with the high cost traditionally creating a buffer in favour of domestic gas users in the southern markets. "But this buffer has been weakened by the Cooper Basin producers (particularly Santos) committing significant volumes of gas to the LNG projects," the report warned. "Those producers historically played a critical role in competing with the Gippsland Basin producers for market share in the southern states. "Weakening this competitive constraint potentially exposes gas buyers in Victoria to prices equivalent to the Queensland price plus transportation costs from Queensland. These dynamics are evident in significant disruption to the established gas flows in southern Australia." The warning came as prices in the wholesale gas market in Victoria hit $9 a gigajoule Tuesday, well above recent levels of around $6, in the wake of cool weather which also pushed the price in NSW to top $11 a gigajoule.

The scramble to export gas has hurt domestic consumers.  3:39pm on 30 May 2017 The federal government has delayed the date of the first payment of the $6.2 billion bank tax by three months and excluded some liabilities from the levy, according to proposed legislation released today. The legislation did not include any sunset clause, which had been sought by the banks given the government had justified the tax as being necessary to help bring the federal budget back into a surplus by the financial year ending June 30, 2021. The six basis points levy on bank liabilities is designed to raise about $1.5 billion a year from the five biggest banks - CBA, Westpac, ANZ, NAB and Macquarie Group - over the next four years. "This represents a fair contribution by the banking sector to the Australian community and contributes to a long-term balanced budget," Treasurer Scott Morrison said in a speech to parliament. The first payment covering the half-year ending December 31 will now be due in March to give the banks a transitional period. The banks have said the cost of the tax will be borne by their customers and their shareholders. Australian Bankers' Association chief executive Anna Bligh said the banks welcomed concessions that excluded derivatives and money held with the RBA, but they still felt the tax was "poorly-designed". "There needs to be further consideration of a sunset clause to limit this tax on the banks to the time where the budget repair job needs to be done," she told reporters. The S&P/ASX 200 Financials index, which includes the major banks and represents 31 per cent of the benchmark index, has fallen by 4.8 per cent since the tax was announced on May 9.

But his view that not all is well on the ASX is not. While no-one has so far followed his lead in publicly quitting the market entirely, many in Australia's professional investment community appear to be quietly preparing for a downturn.  According to the JPMorgan Fund Manager Radar, which assesses the public disclosures of major fund managers to deduce common themes, average cash holdings surged to 370 basis points in April, overtaking consumer discretionary stocks as the largest active position held by fund managers across any ASX sector in April. This follows several months of increasing cash allocations. "We do see the appeal [of cash] in a market where opportunities look increasingly constrained due to extended valuations (healthcare, industrials), structural concerns (banks, resources, retail) and style/franking limitations (REITS)," wrote JP Morgan equity strategist Jason Steed. The increasing allocation to cash holdings shows concern is building among fund managers, said Bennelong Australian Equity Partners' investment director Julian Beaumont.  Similarly, veteran fund manager Geoff Wilson, of Wilson's Asset Management, didn't quibble with Parker's assessment that the market was headed for some kind of downturn.  On the ASX - which has suffered a bad month with the S&P/ASX200 down more than 4 per cent and the big four banks on track to the worst May in 44 years - Wilson said "it's going to be a tough period". "And that's with the backdrop of the biggest global market in the very mature stages of a bull market," he added, referring to Wall Street's record-breaking run. But neither of those fund managers are exiting the field. Here's more Poll Altair CIO Philip Parker has made a statement on how he sees Aussie shares: overvalued and at risk of a major correction. What do you think? I agree, the ASX is overvalued and it's a good idea to sell down stocks.33% Partly. There are clearly overvalued sectors and stocks, but it's still possible to find value.37% No, considering low rates levels, the ASX isn't overvalued and bargain hunting will soon drive the index higher.30% Total votes: 959 Poll closed 31 May, 2017 Disclaimer: These polls are not scientific and reflect the opinion only of visitors who have chosen to participate. 2:51pm on 30 May 2017 Banks and miners are leading the ASX's fightback from three-month lows this afternoon, amid low trading volumes with markets in the US and UK closed overnight and China closed today for holidays. "We saw a continuation of yesterday's sell-off this morning, but we also saw a shift in sentiment after the release of April's building approval numbers, which beat expectations," said Gary Huxtable, client adviser at wealth management firm Atlantic Pacific Securities. "There's definitely a lot of bargain-hunting today," he said. The financial index, which on Monday saw its biggest loss since December, is up 0.7 per cent, helped by monthly improvement in housing starts. The big four plus Macquarie are enjoying gains of around 1 per cent. Miners have recovered from a rout on Monday after tensions over potential iron-ore tax on mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP by the Western Australia state government eased. Rio Tinto and BHP shares are also both up about 1 per cent each, while iron-ore miner Fortescue has added 1.9 per cent. Energy stocks are among the biggest drags despite a moderate recovery in oil prices, as investors seek more clarity on the direction of OPEC-led production curbs. Telstra is down 0.9 per cent. 2:00pm on 30 May 2017 The jobs market is improving in most developed countries - except for Australia, in another sign of growing economic divergence. The unemployment rate is going nowhere and, more worryingly, underemployment is near a 20-year high - as opposed to the US, Europe and Japan, where underutilisation is finally trending lower. "This labour market slack has been continuing to add downward pressure to wages growth," UBS economist Scott Haslem says. While quarterly wage price growth has steadied around 0.5 per cent, the annual pace continues to edge lower, slipping to a 19-year low of 1.9 per cent in the first quarter. Recent jobs data for Australia suggests some easing of this downward pressure on wages over the coming year, thanks to a strong pick-up in jobs growth, to a 3.5 per cent annualised pace over the past three months, Haslem says. "In addition to improving leading indicators of hiring intentions, this suggests wages growth in Australia should soon stabilise, and may even drift higher over the next couple of years." Still, UBS expects the RBA to get successively out-hiked by the US Fed over the coming year, predicting a Fed funds rate of 2.00-2.25 per cent for end-18, above the RBA cash rate forecast of 1.75 per cent. 1:40pm on 30 May 2017 Treasurer Scott Morison has hailed a drop in the number of new interest-only home loans in the March quarter as a sign that a crackdown on speculative property investment is working. Morrison tweeted that the number of interest-only loans had fallen for the first time since 2009 and that in dollar terms the share of the loans was 10 percentage points below the peak level four years ago. Official data shows 1st fall in number of interest-only loans since 2009. Interest-only share of loan approvals 10ppts below peak (APRA)— Scott Morrison (@ScottMorrisonMP) May 30, 2017 Only 1,685 new interest only loans were made by banks in the March quarter, according to Australian Prudential Regulation Authority data, down slightly from 1,692 previously. APRA considers interest-only loans to be specially risky. By value interest-only loans grew to $583 million from $575 million previously. From today's APRA tweet. Record low cash rates & a near doubling in 5 years. Hope the sensitivity is recognised. pic.twitter.com/AKZ3MNHgi2— Peter Morgan (@psimpsonmorgan) May 30, 2017 But in a key indicator for APRA, interest-only loans accounted for 36.2 per cent of total home loans by value in the March quarter down from 37.5 per cent previously.  APRA issued rules at the end of March which required that banks cut interest-only loans to 30 percent of new residential lending.  The latest fall takes the share of interest-only loans back down to the level in the March quarter last year before cuts in official interest rates ignited a boom in house prices and speculative investor lending.  This is not the first time that the value of loans has fallen but as Morrison pointed out the share of interest-only loans in dollar terms is now 10 percentage points below its peak in June 2015. There's been a small reduction, but still plenty of demand for interest-only loans. Photo: Getty Images 1:22pm on 30 May 2017 The euro, which appeared set for parity with the US dollar less than six months ago, is poised to extend its year-to-date rally, bolstered by upbeat economic data and cautious optimism from ECB chief Mario Draghi. The single currency held steady overnight, albeit in thin trade, after the president of the European Central Bank told EU lawmakers in Brussels that the "economic upswing is becoming increasingly solid and continues to broaden across sectors and countries", and "downside risks to the growth outlook are further diminishing". Still, Draghi isn't signalling any rethink just yet: "We remain firmly convinced that an extraordinary amount of monetary policy support, including through our forward guidance, is still necessary." His comments come amid a heightening debate within the ECB, including from Bundesbank chief Jens Weidmann, about planning for a return to more normal policy as inflation turns more positive. The eurozone's May CPI estimate is scheduled to be released on Wednesday, and that is seen as the next key trading data point for the single currency. The euro was fetching $US1.1129 on Tuesday, about 1 cent off recent nine-month highs. The currency has traded between $US1.11 and $US1.12 for most of the last two weeks, lifting its year-to-date advance to more than 6 per cent with an increasing number of forecasters seeing $US1.15 within reach and perhaps even $US1.20 over the next two years. The euro also has recovered against the Australian dollar; the Aussie is trading near 66.64 euro cents - a 2.7 per cent year-to-date decline. Forecasters see losses widening, perhaps to a sub 60 euro cents level, reflecting a divergence in overall monetary policy stances and interest rates in particular. "Looking ahead we think the euro still has a fair bit of upside, but our sense is that the (euro/$US) pair is likely to do a bit of work around the 1.11/12 (level) before it heads higher again," said NAB currency strategist Rodrigo Catril. "Our forecast is for the euro to end the year at 1.15, but given the pair's swift appreciation of late, the risk is that we get there sooner rather than later." "As for our AUD/EUR view,  we think the pair is likely to be face strong downward pressures, both from the USD and EUR arguments mentioned above," Catril said. "Putting our AUD/USD and EUR/USD views together leads to our forecast for AUD/EUR dropping to 62 euro cents by year end and then sub 60 next year." Among the reasons for the return of positive sentiment on the euro is that the eurozone economy is expanding at its fastest pace in six years. The IHS Markit Eurozone PMI held steady at 56.8 in May, according to data released last week, unchanged on April's six-year high, according to the preliminary flash estimate. ECB chief Mario Draghi is more optimistic about the eurozone recovery, but is reluctant to flag monetary tightening. Photo: ALEX KRAUS Back to top 12:57pm on 30 May 2017 Shareholders in Vocus have stepped up their pressure on the board of the company to dump its chief executive Geoff Horth and make changes to the board. In the past two weeks shareholders owning more than 20 per cent of the issued capital of the voice and data network operator have separately put demands to chairman David Spence. The implicit threat was that if Spence did not act then shareholders would use their votes at the next annual meeting to force changes. Spence, who is in Perth for a board meeting, told the AFR's Chanticleer column that he was fully aware of the concerns of shareholders. "There is no doubt given the recent profit downgrade that there is a lot of pressure on us as a board and management at the moment," Spence said. "I have had a lot of shareholders talk to me over the last couple of weeks. There is pressure on us to make changes. "I have a list of a whole lot of things that shareholders want. But we need to do this in an orderly manner." Shares are down 0.8 per cent to $2.965. Vocus investors are critical of CEO Geoff Horth, Photo: NIC_WALKER 12:38pm on 30 May 2017  A rally for Chinese property stocks added a combined $US5.4 billion to the fortunes of three tycoons - in just one day. None fared better than Hui Ka Yan, the richest of them all, whose China Evergrande Group has built him a net worth of nearly $US21 billion. His wealth surged nearly $US4 million on Monday. Among the others, Yang Huiyan of Country Garden Holdings added $US1.3 billion, while Wu Yajun of Longfor Properties tacked on $US400 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires index.  The rally has been confounding analysts focusing particularly on Evergrande, which trades at about 36 times reported earnings, more than double the valuations of Country Garden. Evergrande shares jumped 23 per cent yesterday and have more than tripled this year, hurting short-sellers and baffling even some of the most bullish stock analysts. Part of the sharp rally can be explained by Evergrande's plan to raise money from strategic investors ahead of a planned backdoor listing on the mainland and speculation that the developer will benefit from rising home sales in smaller Chinese cities. A buyback spree has also propelled a 123 per cent jump since late March - when short interest started climbing from a low point. Its astonishing share rally has resulted in the world's most painful short trade this year. To add insult to injury, bearish investors are paying higher fees to get crushed. Fees to borrow shares of the Hong Kong-listed Chinese developer for shorting have surged by more than five times since January to about 10 per cent and have doubled since Evergrande started buying back shares in late March, according to Simon Colvin, an analyst at IHS Markit. Evergrande shares available for lending have "nearly all been spoken for," resulting in higher borrowing costs, Colvin said. Hui Ka Yan's wealth surged by nearly $US4 billion yesterday. Photo: Brent Lewin 12:19pm on 30 May 2017 Home values in Sydney and Melbourne fell in May from April, pushing a national index of dwelling values down 1.1 per cent over the month to date, CoreLogic said. In a preview of full-month figures the data provider will release on Thursday, it gave no indication of whether the monthly fall in the two largest cities related to apartments, houses or both.  The actual fall in prices seen over the month was unlikely to be as great as the initial index suggested, however, as seasonal factors mitigated the decline, CoreLogic research head Tim Lawless said.  "Importantly, the trend rate of growth shows the pace of capital gains has moderated from recent highs; this slowdown is occurring against a backdrop of rising mortgage rates, softer auction results, rising advertised stock levels, lower housing market sentiment and slowing investment activity," Lawless said in a statement. While the figures back the notion of slowdown in price growth, due to tighter credit policies pushed by banking regulator APRA, the signals are mixed - investor lending rose in March for the first time in more than a year, official figures earlier this month showed. However, the figures did not take into account the second round of credit restrictions imposed at the end of that month by banking regulator APRA and these are likely to show in coming months. Sydney and Melbourne housing markets seem to have cooled slightly in May. Photo: Jessica Shapiro 11:57am on 30 May 2017 Was Altair CIO Phil Parker's decision to completely sell out of Aussie stocks a principled and brave decision, a cop-out, or something else altogether? Pat Commins asks: It's as big a statement you can make about how you see the market. That is, if it really was about the market, and not something else. As Parker told me: "We didn't want to be the guys to go back to the clients in three, four months or however long it takes, and say, 'You know what? The last three to four years where we've made these big performance fees and charged you a big fat 1 per cent management fee, well, oops we saw it coming but we didn't warn you because we thought we'd just collect our fees'." That sounds all good and proper, and I have no reason to believe he is not telling the truth. Still, the cynic has to ask - is there something else going on? So ok at least he's leaving with okish numbers - Altair pic.twitter.com/6u2cpQesRh— Con Michalakis (@MichalakisCon) May 30, 2017 The most obvious recent comparison is Peter Hall's surprise decision to quit Hunter Hall on Christmas Eve of last year. That decision came after a tough period for the fund, which had been positioned for a downturn that never came. Of particularly weight were the heavy losses from Hall's outsized exposure to biotech stock Sirtex. The thought of making up those losses seemed to weigh on Hall. Parker is a former colleague of Peter Hall and describes him as a friend. So the link goes beyond mere circumstance. Perhaps they were schooled in the same high conviction style of investing. But Parker says the only problem stocks they have had in their portfolios was an exposure to Brambles, which copped a sharp downgrade earlier this year, and Estia Health, the aged care operator that almost halved in value in quick order in August last year. In that case Parker says the fund got out early, after the shares had dropped a still hefty - but not disastrous - 15 per cent. In other words, the funds have been performing OK over the past year, and have beat their benchmarks since they started in 2013. There have been no massive outflows that threatened the viability of the business, Parker says. No personal pressures.

Building approvals have been on a decline since last August, with the once-booming apartment sector the biggest hit. Data published on today shows a better-than-expected gain of 4.4 per cent in April, but it follows a hefty loss of 10.3 per cent in March.

Apartment approvals are still down an annual 26.5 per cent over the year. Analysts say the data indicates Australia's biggest-ever construction boom is slowly unwinding. "While the monthly update was more positive than expected the slowdown theme remains clear," said Matthew Hassan, senior economist at Westpac. "New dwelling investment is expected to enter a decline from late this year, becoming a material drag on growth." 11:24am on 30 May 2017 Retailers David Jones and Myer are slashing prices on autumn/winter apparel by as much as 50 per cent after pulling the trigger on mid-year clearance sales following the weakest retail trading in five years. David Jones' clearance sale kicked off today, just as the first cold snap for the season sent Sydneysiders scurrying for winter coats and scarves, while Myer's clearance starts on Thursday, in line with last year's mid-year stocktake sale but at least two weeks earlier than that in 2014. David Jones is discounting prices on clothing and accessories by as much as 50 per cent and homewares by as much as 40 per cent, while Myer will take 40 per cent off selected women's clothing, 60 per cent off small appliances and 50 per cent off selected manchester. Once again, Myer and David Jones have arrived late to the party, as specialty retailers such as Country Road, Cue, Witchery and Portmans have been discounting regularly since April to clear slow-moving autumn-winter stock after another balmy autumn. Retailers need to clear autumn/winter stock over the next two months - squeezing gross margins - to make way for spring-summer stock which traditionally arrives in August. The clearance sales follow the worst retail trading conditions since 2012 as cash-strapped consumers cut back on discretionary spending in the face of soaring living costs, stagnant wages growth, record household debt, stalling house prices and looming job losses. Clearance sales are kicking off before winter has even officially started. Photo: Jeff Darmanin 11:09am on 30 May 2017 The acceleration of electric vehicles could be driving Big Oil towards a crash. Fitch says it isn't taking a red pen to oil ratings just yet but warns that an "investor death spiral" looms for companies that fail to evolve. Bloomberg New Energy Finance pinpoints 2028 as the year of reckoning. Over half of global oil demand is driven by transport, with motor vehicles playing a meaningful part. The analysis says electric vehicles could begin cutting into oil demand by 2023, gradually building a fresh supply glut of 2 million barrels of oil a day, on a par with the overhang that triggered the 2014 collapse. Barclays Capital places D-Day only a couple of years later, at 2030, but disagrees that it's a mortal threat. It estimates a hit of 1.8m barrels a day, but says that even with this impact, demand could increase given the growth in the overall number of cars on the road. By the end of the next decade, demand may be 600,000 barrel of oil a day higher than it is today. BP and Royal Dutch Shell will be hoping the investment bank is right. Both oil majors have played down the potential of electric cars in dampening demand in the past, but cracks are showing in their defiance. Earlier this year BP made a radical revision to its expectations. Its annual World Energy Outlook doubled the number of electric vehicles it expects on the world's roads in 2035 from 57m in last year's report to 100m.

Shares have dropped 2.8 per cent to $5.24, taking the slide since mid-May to nearly 20 per cent.  The ACCC says NIB failed to warn customers in advance that it had removed ceratin procedures from its MediGap Scheme, which covers the "gap" between health insurance rebates and Medicare rebates, so members would not face out-of-pocket expenses.  The ACCC alleges that between June 2011 and October 2016, NIB told members that "several of its policies covered eye procedures and members would not pay any out-of-pocket expenses, when in fact members could incur out-of-pocket costs". The Commission says NIB was unconscionable in that the insurer identified 400 members who it "probably ought to proactively communicate" with over the MediGap changes. The ACCC also alleges the insurer warned a doctor who told his own NIB clients of the change not to communicate with NIB members or the media about the MediGap Change.  Analysts have been downbeat on the stock, and the sector, with both Credit Suisse as well as Shaw and Partners downgrading NIB this month. Although profit across the private health insurance sector rose 18.2 per cent to $1.3 billion over the year to April, net margins in the sector have fallen from 5.6 per cent to 4.8 per cent over the period, according to data released by APRA in May. 10:27am on 30 May 2017 The sharemarket has dropped to a two-month low in early trade, amid more selling in retailers and health-care stocks, but there is some cautious buying in the oversold banks. The ASX has slipped 0.2 per cent to 5697.5, dropping below the 5700-mark for the first time since March. Investors are lacking overseas guidance, with both the US and UK markets closed for public holidays.  Leading the falls among blue chips is CSL, which has dropped 0.7 per cent, followed by Wesfarmers, down 0.5 per cent. Domino's is the worst performer among the top 200 stocks, falling 2.8 per cent after it was downgraded by several analysts yesterday. The big banks are mostly higher, led by a 0.4 per cent rise in NAB. "Although bank stocks have now fallen to valuations that are at or below average levels for recent years, they are still well above 'bargain basement levels'," CMC chief market analyst Ric Spooner says. "This means there is not yet an obvious case for bargain hunters to step in, given the degree of political risk faced by shareholders in this industry and concerns about the potential for a downturn in the housing market."

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    After a stint of frugality, Americans have returned to their borrowing ways. But are they getting into the kinds of debt trouble that lead to recessions? U.S. consumers now owe roughly $12.73 trillion to banks and other lenders for mortgages, car loans and credit card spending, according to the New York Federal Reserve. That exceeds even the total before the last financial crisis. Economists generally say people's willingness to borrow is a good thing, because it shows they're more confident about their financial futures. And the economy is in far better shape than a decade ago, when economists called the debt unsustainable and the housing market crashed. That's not the concern now. "Some of us are worried that consumers are going back into old habits, but the U.S. consumer is in a much different position before the financial crisis and even before in the late 1990s," said Ryan Sweet, an economist with Moody's Analytics who is not related to the AP reporter. Gone are the worries about second homes financed with no-money down mortgages. The stress points now are in three main categories: auto loans, credit cards and — to a greater extent but for different reasons — student loans. "If it's not a tool you can use to build stability and long-term net worth, debt leads to more problems than it can solve," said Todd Christensen, a credit counselor with the nonprofit organization Debt Reduction Services. STUDENT LOANS Not all debt is considered equal, and both mortgages and student loans have typically been considered ways for people to leverage themselves into a better life. A home loan historically has been a way for middle-class Americans to build wealth, while student loans helped people get better-paying jobs. Student loans have become a source of concern, though, as they become a greater proportion of the debt Americans owe — and those debts are not being paid back. In 2007, student loan debt was less than 5 percent of the debt Americans owned. That figure has more than doubled in 10 years to nearly 11 percent. As college costs have risen and student loans get larger, the amounts that are delinquent have been increasing. Americans currently have $1.34 trillion in student loan debt, of which 10.98 percent is 90 or more days past due. That's up from 6.85 percent of loans 10 years ago. "Student loans are a place to keep an eye on," Sweet said as a potential long-term problem for the U.S. economy. Delinquent student loans can hurt a person's credit score, and affect the ability for a first-time buyer to qualify for a mortgage. That could become a bigger problem as millennials enter their prime years to become a homeowner. Dallas resident Taylor Green, 29, is using debt strategically. Green, who works in finance, recently opened a credit card to help him and his fiancé pay for their wedding. He hopes to use the points he earns from that to then help cover the cost of a trip to Europe. "We both have good, stable jobs with decent security, so we are a more comfortable taking on the debt," Green said. "But we want to pay this debt down as fast as we can once the wedding is over." Green says he also has significant student loan debt, which is in forbearance, that he plans to tackle aggressively once the wedding is over. CAR LOANS Americans have been on a car-buying binge, as automakers sold a record 17.6 million cars last year to beat the level set a year earlier. People are also borrowing more money to buy their cars and are financing them for longer periods of time. The average length of a new car loan is around 62 months, compared to 55 months before the Great Recession, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve. And delinquencies in auto loans have been inching higher as well. The percent of auto loans 90 or more past due has climbed for 13 straight months, to 2.30 percent of all loans. Five years ago, that figure was 1.63 percent. Most of the delinquencies in auto loans have been concentrated around subprime borrowing, which has become more accessible to consumers in recent years. Americans with credit scores of less than 620, which is typically considered subprime or deep subprime, owe roughly $280 billion in auto loans — exceeding their pre-recession peak set in 2007, according to the New York Federal Reserve. But economists don't believe that if those loans go bad that it would pose a risk to the U.S. economy, like subprime mortgages did in 2007. The entire auto loan industry is $1.17 trillion, compared with the $8.63 trillion mortgage market. CREDIT CARDS Of the three worry spots, credit cards are often seen as the most toxic of debts. They're easy to accumulate, generally used to buy non-wealth generating consumer goods and often have the highest interest rates. Americans are carrying less credit card debt then they did before the Great Recession, but have re-embraced using them. Credit card debt has risen from $659 billion in 2014 to $746 billion last year, according to data from the New York Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, after years of trending lower, Federal Reserve data shows credit card delinquencies have reversed course and are climbing again — albeit still from relatively low levels. Banks are seeing the same trend. JPMorgan Chase, one of the nation's biggest credit card issuers, had to set aside slightly more money to cover bad credit card debts in the most recent quarter. American Express, which historically has some of the lowest default rates because its customers tend to be well-off, also saw those rates rise slightly in its U.S. card business last quarter. "It's worrisome, but at the same time, it was also inevitable," said Matt Schultz, senior industry analyst with Creditcards.com, a division of Bankrate.com. "There's only so much credit card debt Americans can hold before they get into trouble." Another specter over those who are carrying higher credit card balances: interest rates. With the economy in good shape, the Federal Reserve has started raising interest rates. But unlike mortgages, most auto loans and student loans, credit card rates are variable, and can move higher as the prime rate does. So that 15 percent rate on a credit card balance has moved up to 16 percent. How much small changes will affect people's ability to pay isn't clear, but Schultz is watching closely. "Delinquencies will rise as interest rates rise. I don't know what the tipping point will be for the consumer is, but it's going to be fascinating to watch," he said. © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

We made the investment in part because we believe it will.” The investment bank’s asset-management arm bought the securities, sold by Petroleos de Venezuela SA, through a broker and had no interaction with the government, New York-based Goldman Sachs said. They’re being held in funds and accounts the company manages for clients, according to the statement. “It is apparent Goldman Sachs decided to make a quick buck off the suffering of the Venezuelan people,” Julio Borges, the opposition lawmaker who heads the National Assembly, wrote in a letter to Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein that was seen by Bloomberg. Congress will investigate the deal, he said. “I also intend to recommend to any future democratic government of Venezuela not to recognize or pay on these bonds.” Venezuela’s opposition has been urging Wall Street banks not to throw a financial lifeline to Maduro, who’s faced almost two months of public protests while cutting imports of food and medicine to conserve cash and continue bond payments. The nation’s dollar shortage, exacerbated by a collapse in oil prices, has left investors trying to gauge the likelihood that the government can keep servicing its debt. For more politics coverage, subscribe to the Bloomberg Politics Balance of Power newsletter Julio Borges Photographer: Wil Riera/Bloomberg 31 Cents Goldman Sachs paid about $865 million, or 31 cents on the dollar, for the bonds, the Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, citing five unidentified people familiar with last week’s transaction. Spokesmen for the central bank, which had held the notes, didn’t respond to messages. The investment bank stressed that it’s not alone in investing in the country. “Many investors make similar investments daily through mutual funds, index funds and ETFs which also hold PDVSA bonds,” the firm said.

Sign Up Last month, lawmakers reached out to big Wall Street firms including Goldman Sachs, asking them not to help the country monetize its $7.7 billion in gold reserves. In an editorial on Friday, Harvard University economist Ricardo Hausmann -- a former planning minister in Venezuela and long-time critic of the current government -- called on JPMorgan Chase & Co. to remove Venezuela from its bond indexes so investors tracking the gauges aren’t compelled to buy those notes. Read more: Venezuela lawmakers ask Wall Street to stop aiding Maduro In his letter, Borges said Goldman Sachs’s deal violates the bank’s own code of conduct and its statement on human rights. A copy of that statement on the firm’s website said its respect for human rights is “fundamental to and informs our business,” and that the firm places a “high priority” on identifying potential issues when deciding whether to do business with a client. Borges said the transaction helps Maduro. It’s “a financial lifeline to his authoritarian regime that is systematically violating the human rights of Venezuelans,” the lawmaker wrote in his letter to Blankfein. The “irregular nature” and “absurd financial terms involved” are “to the detriment of Venezuela and its people,” Borges said. The opposition group SOS Venezuela tweeted that it plans a protest in front of the bank’s New York headquarters Tuesday. Fintech Advisory Inc., a New York-based investment fund, previously agreed to buy $1.3 billion of PDVSA bonds in a repo transaction providing at least $300 million of cash, Reuters reported in early April. Goldman Sachs was the seventh-largest holder of PDVSA bonds as of March 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Venezuela’s international reserves rebounded from near the lowest since 2002 last week, gaining more than $700 million to $10.86 billion as of May 25.

(AP Photo/David Goldman, File) Posted: Monday, May 29, 2017 4:05 am As Americans take on more debt, some pockets of concern Associated Press | 0 comments NEW YORK (AP) — After a stint of frugality, Americans have returned to their borrowing ways. But are they getting into the kinds of debt trouble that lead to recessions? U.S. consumers now owe roughly $12.73 trillion to banks and other lenders for mortgages, car loans and credit card spending, according to the New York Federal Reserve. That exceeds even the total before the last financial crisis. Economists generally say people's willingness to borrow is a good thing, because it shows they're more confident about their financial futures. And the economy is in far better shape than a decade ago, when economists called the debt unsustainable and the housing market crashed. That's not the concern now. "Some of us are worried that consumers are going back into old habits, but the U.S. consumer is in a much different position before the financial crisis and even before in the late 1990s," said Ryan Sweet, an economist with Moody's Analytics who is not related to the AP reporter. Gone are the worries about second homes financed with no-money down mortgages. The stress points now are in three main categories: auto loans, credit cards and — to a greater extent but for different reasons — student loans. "If it's not a tool you can use to build stability and long-term net worth, debt leads to more problems than it can solve," said Todd Christensen, a credit counselor with the nonprofit organization Debt Reduction Services. STUDENT LOANS Not all debt is considered equal, and both mortgages and student loans have typically been considered ways for people to leverage themselves into a better life. A home loan historically has been a way for middle-class Americans to build wealth, while student loans helped people get better-paying jobs. Student loans have become a source of concern, though, as they become a greater proportion of the debt Americans owe — and those debts are not being paid back. In 2007, student loan debt was less than 5 percent of the debt Americans owned. That figure has more than doubled in 10 years to nearly 11 percent. As college costs have risen and student loans get larger, the amounts that are delinquent have been increasing. Americans currently have $1.34 trillion in student loan debt, of which 10.98 percent is 90 or more days past due. That's up from 6.85 percent of loans 10 years ago. "Student loans are a place to keep an eye on," Sweet said as a potential long-term problem for the U.S. economy. Delinquent student loans can hurt a person's credit score, and affect the ability for a first-time buyer to qualify for a mortgage. That could become a bigger problem as millennials enter their prime years to become a homeowner. Dallas resident Taylor Green, 29, is using debt strategically. Green, who works in finance, recently opened a credit card to help him and his fiancé pay for their wedding. He hopes to use the points he earns from that to then help cover the cost of a trip to Europe. "We both have good, stable jobs with decent security, so we are a more comfortable taking on the debt," Green said. "But we want to pay this debt down as fast as we can once the wedding is over." Green says he also has significant student loan debt, which is in forbearance, that he plans to tackle aggressively once the wedding is over. CAR LOANS Americans have been on a car-buying binge, as automakers sold a record 17.6 million cars last year to beat the level set a year earlier.

Tech Search Search VenezuelaThe Airline Standoff in Venezuela is Getting Worse as the Country’s Crisis Deepens aerospace and defenseOculus Founder Palmer Luckey Is Working on a Defense Startup Entrepreneur3 Questions You Should Ask Yourself Before Quitting Your Job trump budgetWhat the U.S. Loses If Trump Eliminates AmeriCorps Peloton Peloton’s CEO Talks Big Funding, Expansion, and an IPO Leena Rao May 29, 2017 Peloton, a maker of Internet-connected fitness bikes, is riding high after raising $325 million in new funding this week, valuing the company at $1.25 billion. The newly minted "unicorn," which was founded by CEO John Foley, sells a $1,995 bike that comes with an attached tablet for streaming spinning and exercise classes live. Customers pay $39 monthly to ride along during an unlimited number of classes. The bike's sensors collect data like revolutions per minute, speed, and distance, which is transmitted via the Internet to the company. During classes, riders can have their speed matched against others who are taking the same class at the same time. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Peloton's rise has also coincided with spinning chain SoulCycle's growth. SoulCycle, which filed paperwork to go public but has not yet listed on an exchange, offers classes at its retail chains around the U.S. and in Canada. Peloton, by comparison, is focused on bringing spinning classes to customer's homes. Foley chatted with Fortune about why he started Peloton, what the new funding would be used for, and the potential for an IPO. (This interview was edited for length and clarity) Fortune: Where did you first get the idea for Peloton? Foley: I was working in technology. I love consumer Internet, and software, and technology, and six or seven years ago, I was going to SoulCycle and fellow spinning chain Flywheel and noticing I work harder in those classes than in an average gym workout. When someone coaches you through and you have the motivation of other people in the class, it’s a better model. But I had young kids, and I couldn't plan my workouts a week in advance. I wanted the work out on my time, in my location, and on my terms. I thought that there must be a way to have the best seat at a much better value. I wanted to figure out a way to bring this home. You wouldn't go to a spin class with no one in it. That's why the community is so important. We stream content and bring community into the experience so you don’t feel alone. You can see the instructor and riders in the studio and see how other people in the class are performing by the leaderboard. It brings the offline experience in. Tell us more about why you raised $325 million from these investors? We raised from four kinds of investors. First we took "crossover money from institutional investors like Fidelity and Wellington, which will be helpful as we consider making the transition from a private company to a public one. We also took money from late stage venture investors like Kleiner Perkins which is the best in the world. And NBC Universal is a strategic investor since we stream twelve hours of live TV a day. No media company is getting people to pay $39 per month for one channel of content. The fourth type of investor was the private bank of JP Morgan Chase, which invested tens of millions from their client base of high net worth individuals. How do you plan to use the new cash? We just launched yoga classes, which was the first non-spinning class you could take from the bike. And we are in the process of building a studio in New York City that will let us stream content from four different studios. We're also going to be building content for other types of fitness equipment. Similar to our current studio in Chelsea, the new studio will be open to members who want to take a class in person. Do you plan to open other studios? We like the authenticity of offering a real class to members but we don't want to be in the studio business. What else are you going to be doing with the new money? We're going to open new Peloton stores in Denver and Seattle. We'll have 22 stores that sell bikes, open by next month and 33 retail outlets by the end of the year. We're also doubling the size of the software and engineering team and increasing marketing spend to get the word out about the company. Tell us about your commercial strategy We’re excited about a new partnership with Westin hotels where they are putting Peloton bikes in their gyms and potentially in some hotel rooms. It was in response to our customers' demand that we expanded to hotels. While it seems like we could expand to gym chains, we're not pursuing it right now. We have deals with high-end apartment buildings to put the bikes in building gyms. But we feel like if a person in a commercial gym uses a Peloton bike and then purchases it for their house it might hurt the gym partner. So we are getting into that space lightly. How big is the team? We’re 400 employees including studio and retail stores. Is an IPO in the future? I think it's a natural part of the Peloton growth story. I feel like 10 years from now we will be public. I like the idea of going public mostly to get the word out for how special the experience is, to build awareness and improve people’s health and fitness.

As Americans take on more debt, some pockets of concern World by Ken Sweet, The Associated Press Posted May 29, 2017 8:07 am MDT Last Updated May 29, 2017 at 11:00 am MDT FILE - In this July 18, 2012, file photo, a pedestrian walks past credit card logos posted on a downtown storefront in Atlanta. After a stint of frugality, Americans have returned to their borrowing ways. But are they getting into the kinds of debt trouble that lead to recessions? In 2017, U.S. consumers now owe roughly $12.73 trillion to banks and other lenders for mortgages, car loans and credit card spending, according to the New York Federal Reserve. That exceeds even the total before the last financial crisis. (AP Photo/David Goldman, File) NEW YORK, N.Y. – After a stint of frugality, Americans have returned to their borrowing ways. But are they getting into the kinds of debt trouble that lead to recessions? U.S. consumers now owe roughly $12.73 trillion to banks and other lenders for mortgages, car loans and credit card spending, according to the New York Federal Reserve. That exceeds even the total before the last financial crisis. Economists generally say people’s willingness to borrow is a good thing, because it shows they’re more confident about their financial futures. And the economy is in far better shape than a decade ago, when economists called the debt unsustainable and the housing market crashed. That’s not the concern now. “Some of us are worried that consumers are going back into old habits, but the U.S. consumer is in a much different position before the financial crisis and even before in the late 1990s,” said Ryan Sweet, an economist with Moody’s Analytics who is not related to the AP reporter. Gone are the worries about second homes financed with no-money down mortgages. The stress points now are in three main categories: auto loans, credit cards and — to a greater extent but for different reasons — student loans. “If it’s not a tool you can use to build stability and long-term net worth, debt leads to more problems than it can solve,” said Todd Christensen, a credit counsellor with the non-profit organization Debt Reduction Services. STUDENT LOANS Not all debt is considered equal, and both mortgages and student loans have typically been considered ways for people to leverage themselves into a better life. A home loan historically has been a way for middle-class Americans to build wealth, while student loans helped people get better-paying jobs. Student loans have become a source of concern, though, as they become a greater proportion of the debt Americans owe — and those debts are not being paid back. In 2007, student loan debt was less than 5 per cent of the debt Americans owned. That figure has more than doubled in 10 years to nearly 11 per cent. As college costs have risen and student loans get larger, the amounts that are delinquent have been increasing. Americans currently have $1.34 trillion in student loan debt, of which 10.98 per cent is 90 or more days past due. That’s up from 6.85 per cent of loans 10 years ago. “Student loans are a place to keep an eye on,” Sweet said as a potential long-term problem for the U.S. economy. Delinquent student loans can hurt a person’s credit score, and affect the ability for a first-time buyer to qualify for a mortgage. That could become a bigger problem as millennials enter their prime years to become a homeowner. Dallas resident Taylor Green, 29, is using debt strategically. Green, who works in finance, recently opened a credit card to help him and his fiancé pay for their wedding. He hopes to use the points he earns from that to then help cover the cost of a trip to Europe. “We both have good, stable jobs with decent security, so we are a more comfortable taking on the debt,” Green said. “But we want to pay this debt down as fast as we can once the wedding is over.” Green says he also has significant student loan debt, which is in forbearance, that he plans to tackle aggressively once the wedding is over. CAR LOANS Americans have been on a car-buying binge, as automakers sold a record 17.6 million cars last year to beat the level set a year earlier. People are also borrowing more money to buy their cars and are financing them for longer periods of time. The average length of a new car loan is around 62 months, compared to 55 months before the Great Recession, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve. And delinquencies in auto loans have been inching higher as well. The per cent of auto loans 90 or more past due has climbed for 13 straight months, to 2.30 per cent of all loans. Five years ago, that figure was 1.63 per cent. Most of the delinquencies in auto loans have been concentrated around subprime borrowing, which has become more accessible to consumers in recent years. Americans with credit scores of less than 620, which is typically considered subprime or deep subprime, owe roughly $280 billion in auto loans — exceeding their pre-recession peak set in 2007, according to the New York Federal Reserve. But economists don’t believe that if those loans go bad that it would pose a risk to the U.S. economy, like subprime mortgages did in 2007. The entire auto loan industry is $1.17 trillion, compared with the $8.63 trillion mortgage market. CREDIT CARDS Of the three worry spots, credit cards are often seen as the most toxic of debts. They’re easy to accumulate, generally used to buy non-wealth generating consumer goods and often have the highest interest rates. Americans are carrying less credit card debt then they did before the Great Recession, but have re-embraced using them. Credit card debt has risen from $659 billion in 2014 to $746 billion last year, according to data from the New York Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, after years of trending lower, Federal Reserve data shows credit card delinquencies have reversed course and are climbing again — albeit still from relatively low levels. Banks are seeing the same trend. JPMorgan Chase, one of the nation’s biggest credit card issuers, had to set aside slightly more money to cover bad credit card debts in the most recent quarter. American Express, which historically has some of the lowest default rates because its customers tend to be well-off, also saw those rates rise slightly in its U.S. card business last quarter. “It’s worrisome, but at the same time, it was also inevitable,” said Matt Schultz, senior industry analyst with Creditcards.com, a division of Bankrate.com. “There’s only so much credit card debt Americans can hold before they get into trouble.” Another spectre over those who are carrying higher credit card balances: interest rates. With the economy in good shape, the Federal Reserve has started raising interest rates. But unlike mortgages, most auto loans and student loans, credit card rates are variable, and can move higher as the prime rate does. So that 15 per cent rate on a credit card balance has moved up to 16 per cent. How much small changes will affect people’s ability to pay isn’t clear, but Schultz is watching closely. “Delinquencies will rise as interest rates rise. I don’t know what the tipping point will be for the consumer is, but it’s going to be fascinating to watch,” he said. ___ Ken Sweet covers banking and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

Ken Sweet NEW YORK — The Associated Press Published Monday, May 29, 2017 10:12AM EDT Last updated Monday, May 29, 2017 10:15AM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print After a stint of frugality, Americans have returned to their borrowing ways. But are they getting into the kinds of debt trouble that lead to recessions? U.S. consumers now owe roughly $12.73 trillion to banks and other lenders for mortgages, car loans and credit card spending, according to the New York Federal Reserve. That exceeds even the total before the last financial crisis. Economists generally say people’s willingness to borrow is a good thing, because it shows they’re more confident about their financial futures. And the economy is in far better shape than a decade ago, when economists called the debt unsustainable and the housing market crashed. That’s not the concern now. “Some of us are worried that consumers are going back into old habits, but the U.S. consumer is in a much different position before the financial crisis and even before in the late 1990s,” said Ryan Sweet, an economist with Moody’s Analytics who is not related to the AP reporter. Gone are the worries about second homes financed with no-money down mortgages. The stress points now are in three main categories: auto loans, credit cards and — to a greater extent but for different reasons — student loans. “If it’s not a tool you can use to build stability and long-term net worth, debt leads to more problems than it can solve,” said Todd Christensen, a credit counsellor with the non-profit organization Debt Reduction Services. STUDENT LOANS Not all debt is considered equal, and both mortgages and student loans have typically been considered ways for people to leverage themselves into a better life. A home loan historically has been a way for middle-class Americans to build wealth, while student loans helped people get better-paying jobs. Student loans have become a source of concern, though, as they become a greater proportion of the debt Americans owe — and those debts are not being paid back. In 2007, student loan debt was less than 5 per cent of the debt Americans owned. That figure has more than doubled in 10 years to nearly 11 per cent. As college costs have risen and student loans get larger, the amounts that are delinquent have been increasing. Americans currently have $1.34 trillion in student loan debt, of which 10.98 per cent is 90 or more days past due. That’s up from 6.85 per cent of loans 10 years ago. “Student loans are a place to keep an eye on,” Sweet said as a potential long-term problem for the U.S. economy. Delinquent student loans can hurt a person’s credit score, and affect the ability for a first-time buyer to qualify for a mortgage. That could become a bigger problem as millennials enter their prime years to become a homeowner. Dallas resident Taylor Green, 29, is using debt strategically. Green, who works in finance, recently opened a credit card to help him and his fiance pay for their wedding. He hopes to use the points he earns from that to then help cover the cost of a trip to Europe. “We both have good, stable jobs with decent security, so we are a more comfortable taking on the debt,” Green said. “But we want to pay this debt down as fast as we can once the wedding is over.” Green says he also has significant student loan debt, which is in forbearance, that he plans to tackle aggressively once the wedding is over. CAR LOANS Americans have been on a car-buying binge, as automakers sold a record 17.6 million cars last year to beat the level set a year earlier. People are also borrowing more money to buy their cars and are financing them for longer periods of time. The average length of a new car loan is around 62 months, compared to 55 months before the Great Recession, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve. And delinquencies in auto loans have been inching higher as well. The per cent of auto loans 90 or more past due has climbed for 13 straight months, to 2.30 per cent of all loans. Five years ago, that figure was 1.63 per cent. Most of the delinquencies in auto loans have been concentrated around subprime borrowing, which has become more accessible to consumers in recent years. Americans with credit scores of less than 620, which is typically considered subprime or deep subprime, owe roughly $280 billion in auto loans — exceeding their pre-recession peak set in 2007, according to the New York Federal Reserve. But economists don’t believe that if those loans go bad that it would pose a risk to the U.S. economy, like subprime mortgages did in 2007. The entire auto loan industry is $1.17 trillion, compared with the $8.63 trillion mortgage market. CREDIT CARDS Of the three worry spots, credit cards are often seen as the most toxic of debts. They’re easy to accumulate, generally used to buy non-wealth generating consumer goods and often have the highest interest rates. Americans are carrying less credit card debt then they did before the Great Recession, but have re-embraced using them. Credit card debt has risen from $659 billion in 2014 to $746 billion last year, according to data from the New York Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, after years of trending lower, Federal Reserve data shows credit card delinquencies have reversed course and are climbing again — albeit still from relatively low levels. Banks are seeing the same trend. JPMorgan Chase, one of the nation’s biggest credit card issuers, had to set aside slightly more money to cover bad credit card debts in the most recent quarter. American Express, which historically has some of the lowest default rates because its customers tend to be well-off, also saw those rates rise slightly in its U.S. card business last quarter. “It’s worrisome, but at the same time, it was also inevitable,” said Matt Schultz, senior industry analyst with Creditcards.com, a division of Bankrate.com. “There’s only so much credit card debt Americans can hold before they get into trouble.” Another spectre over those who are carrying higher credit card balances: interest rates. With the economy in good shape, the Federal Reserve has started raising interest rates. But unlike mortgages, most auto loans and student loans, credit card rates are variable, and can move higher as the prime rate does. So that 15 per cent rate on a credit card balance has moved up to 16 per cent. How much small changes will affect people’s ability to pay isn’t clear, but Schultz is watching closely. “Delinquencies will rise as interest rates rise. I don’t know what the tipping point will be for the consumer is, but it’s going to be fascinating to watch,” he said.

But are they getting into the kinds of debt trouble that lead to recessions? U.S. consumers now owe roughly $12.73 trillion to banks and other lenders for mortgages, car loans and credit card spending, according to the New York Federal Reserve. That exceeds even the total before the last financial crisis. Economists generally say people's willingness to borrow is a good thing, because it shows they're more confident about their financial futures. And the economy is in far better shape than a decade ago, when economists called the debt unsustainable and the housing market crashed. That's not the concern now.

After a stint of frugality, Americans have returned to their borrowing ways. But are they getting into the kinds of debt trouble that lead to recessions? In 2017, U.S. consumers now owe roughly $12.73 trillion to banks and other lenders for mortgages, car loans and credit card spending, according to the New York Federal Reserve. That exceeds even the total before the last financial crisis. (AP Photo/David Goldman, File) "Some of us are worried that consumers are going back into old habits, but the U.S. consumer is in a much different position before the financial crisis and even before in the late 1990s," said Ryan Sweet, an economist with Moody's Analytics who is not related to the AP reporter. Gone are the worries about second homes financed with no-money down mortgages. The stress points now are in three main categories: auto loans, credit cards and - to a greater extent but for different reasons - student loans. "If it's not a tool you can use to build stability and long-term net worth, debt leads to more problems than it can solve," said Todd Christensen, a credit counselor with the nonprofit organization Debt Reduction Services. STUDENT LOANS Not all debt is considered equal, and both mortgages and student loans have typically been considered ways for people to leverage themselves into a better life. A home loan historically has been a way for middle-class Americans to build wealth, while student loans helped people get better-paying jobs. Student loans have become a source of concern, though, as they become a greater proportion of the debt Americans owe - and those debts are not being paid back. In 2007, student loan debt was less than 5 percent of the debt Americans owned. That figure has more than doubled in 10 years to nearly 11 percent. As college costs have risen and student loans get larger, the amounts that are delinquent have been increasing. Americans currently have $1.34 trillion in student loan debt, of which 10.98 percent is 90 or more days past due. That's up from 6.85 percent of loans 10 years ago. "Student loans are a place to keep an eye on," Sweet said as a potential long-term problem for the U.S. economy. Delinquent student loans can hurt a person's credit score, and affect the ability for a first-time buyer to qualify for a mortgage. That could become a bigger problem as millennials enter their prime years to become a homeowner. Dallas resident Taylor Green, 29, is using debt strategically. Green, who works in finance, recently opened a credit card to help him and his fiancé pay for their wedding. He hopes to use the points he earns from that to then help cover the cost of a trip to Europe. "We both have good, stable jobs with decent security, so we are a more comfortable taking on the debt," Green said. "But we want to pay this debt down as fast as we can once the wedding is over." Green says he also has significant student loan debt, which is in forbearance, that he plans to tackle aggressively once the wedding is over. CAR LOANS Americans have been on a car-buying binge, as automakers sold a record 17.6 million cars last year to beat the level set a year earlier. People are also borrowing more money to buy their cars and are financing them for longer periods of time. The average length of a new car loan is around 62 months, compared to 55 months before the Great Recession, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve. And delinquencies in auto loans have been inching higher as well. The percent of auto loans 90 or more past due has climbed for 13 straight months, to 2.30 percent of all loans. Five years ago, that figure was 1.63 percent. Most of the delinquencies in auto loans have been concentrated around subprime borrowing, which has become more accessible to consumers in recent years. Americans with credit scores of less than 620, which is typically considered subprime or deep subprime, owe roughly $280 billion in auto loans - exceeding their pre-recession peak set in 2007, according to the New York Federal Reserve. But economists don't believe that if those loans go bad that it would pose a risk to the U.S. economy, like subprime mortgages did in 2007. The entire auto loan industry is $1.17 trillion, compared with the $8.63 trillion mortgage market. CREDIT CARDS Of the three worry spots, credit cards are often seen as the most toxic of debts. They're easy to accumulate, generally used to buy non-wealth generating consumer goods and often have the highest interest rates. Americans are carrying less credit card debt then they did before the Great Recession, but have re-embraced using them. Credit card debt has risen from $659 billion in 2014 to $746 billion last year, according to data from the New York Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, after years of trending lower, Federal Reserve data shows credit card delinquencies have reversed course and are climbing again - albeit still from relatively low levels. Banks are seeing the same trend. JPMorgan Chase, one of the nation's biggest credit card issuers, had to set aside slightly more money to cover bad credit card debts in the most recent quarter. American Express, which historically has some of the lowest default rates because its customers tend to be well-off, also saw those rates rise slightly in its U.S. card business last quarter. "It's worrisome, but at the same time, it was also inevitable," said Matt Schultz, senior industry analyst with Creditcards.com, a division of Bankrate.com. "There's only so much credit card debt Americans can hold before they get into trouble." Another specter over those who are carrying higher credit card balances: interest rates. With the economy in good shape, the Federal Reserve has started raising interest rates. But unlike mortgages, most auto loans and student loans, credit card rates are variable, and can move higher as the prime rate does. So that 15 percent rate on a credit card balance has moved up to 16 percent. How much small changes will affect people's ability to pay isn't clear, but Schultz is watching closely. "Delinquencies will rise as interest rates rise. I don't know what the tipping point will be for the consumer is, but it's going to be fascinating to watch," he said. ___ Ken Sweet covers banking and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/David Goldman, File) By: Ken Sweet The Associated Press Published on NEW YORK — After a stint of frugality, Americans have returned to their borrowing ways. But are they getting into the kinds of debt trouble that lead to recessions? U.S. consumers now owe roughly $12.73 trillion to banks and other lenders for mortgages, car loans and credit card spending, according to the New York Federal Reserve. That exceeds even the total before the last financial crisis. Economists generally say people's willingness to borrow is a good thing, because it shows they're more confident about their financial futures. And the economy is in far better shape than a decade ago, when economists called the debt unsustainable and the housing market crashed. That's not the concern now. "Some of us are worried that consumers are going back into old habits, but the U.S. consumer is in a much different position before the financial crisis and even before in the late 1990s," said Ryan Sweet, an economist with Moody's Analytics who is not related to the AP reporter. Gone are the worries about second homes financed with no-money down mortgages. The stress points now are in three main categories: auto loans, credit cards and — to a greater extent but for different reasons — student loans. "If it's not a tool you can use to build stability and long-term net worth, debt leads to more problems than it can solve," said Todd Christensen, a credit counsellor with the non-profit organization Debt Reduction Services. STUDENT LOANS Not all debt is considered equal, and both mortgages and student loans have typically been considered ways for people to leverage themselves into a better life. A home loan historically has been a way for middle-class Americans to build wealth, while student loans helped people get better-paying jobs. Student loans have become a source of concern, though, as they become a greater proportion of the debt Americans owe — and those debts are not being paid back. In 2007, student loan debt was less than 5 per cent of the debt Americans owned. That figure has more than doubled in 10 years to nearly 11 per cent . As college costs have risen and student loans get larger, the amounts that are delinquent have been increasing. Americans currently have $1.34 trillion in student loan debt, of which 10.98 per cent is 90 or more days past due. That's up from 6.85 per cent of loans 10 years ago. "Student loans are a place to keep an eye on," Sweet said as a potential long-term problem for the U.S. economy. Delinquent student loans can hurt a person's credit score, and affect the ability for a first-time buyer to qualify for a mortgage. That could become a bigger problem as millennials enter their prime years to become a homeowner. Dallas resident Taylor Green, 29, is using debt strategically. Green, who works in finance, recently opened a credit card to help him and his fiancé pay for their wedding. He hopes to use the points he earns from that to then help cover the cost of a trip to Europe. "We both have good, stable jobs with decent security, so we are a more comfortable taking on the debt," Green said. "But we want to pay this debt down as fast as we can once the wedding is over." Green says he also has significant student loan debt, which is in forbearance, that he plans to tackle aggressively once the wedding is over. CAR LOANS Americans have been on a car-buying binge, as automakers sold a record 17.6 million cars last year to beat the level set a year earlier. People are also borrowing more money to buy their cars and are financing them for longer periods of time. The average length of a new car loan is around 62 months, compared to 55 months before the Great Recession, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve. And delinquencies in auto loans have been inching higher as well. The per cent of auto loans 90 or more past due has climbed for 13 straight months, to 2.30 per cent of all loans. Five years ago, that figure was 1.63 per cent . Most of the delinquencies in auto loans have been concentrated around subprime borrowing, which has become more accessible to consumers in recent years. Americans with credit scores of less than 620, which is typically considered subprime or deep subprime, owe roughly $280 billion in auto loans — exceeding their pre-recession peak set in 2007, according to the New York Federal Reserve. But economists don't believe that if those loans go bad that it would pose a risk to the U.S. economy, like subprime mortgages did in 2007. The entire auto loan industry is $1.17 trillion, compared with the $8.63 trillion mortgage market. CREDIT CARDS Of the three worry spots, credit cards are often seen as the most toxic of debts. They're easy to accumulate, generally used to buy non-wealth generating consumer goods and often have the highest interest rates. Americans are carrying less credit card debt then they did before the Great Recession, but have re-embraced using them. Credit card debt has risen from $659 billion in 2014 to $746 billion last year, according to data from the New York Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, after years of trending lower, Federal Reserve data shows credit card delinquencies have reversed course and are climbing again — albeit still from relatively low levels. Banks are seeing the same trend. JPMorgan Chase, one of the nation's biggest credit card issuers, had to set aside slightly more money to cover bad credit card debts in the most recent quarter. American Express, which historically has some of the lowest default rates because its customers tend to be well-off, also saw those rates rise slightly in its U.S. card business last quarter. "It's worrisome, but at the same time, it was also inevitable," said Matt Schultz, senior industry analyst with Creditcards.com, a division of Bankrate.com. "There's only so much credit card debt Americans can hold before they get into trouble." Another spectre over those who are carrying higher credit card balances: interest rates. With the economy in good shape, the Federal Reserve has started raising interest rates. But unlike mortgages, most auto loans and student loans, credit card rates are variable, and can move higher as the prime rate does. So that 15 per cent rate on a credit card balance has moved up to 16 per cent . How much small changes will affect people's ability to pay isn't clear, but Schultz is watching closely. "Delinquencies will rise as interest rates rise. I don't know what the tipping point will be for the consumer is, but it's going to be fascinating to watch," he said. ___ Ken Sweet covers banking and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

By: Bloomberg | Published: May 29, 2017 5:32 PM The U.S. is tightening the criteria for visa programs that Tech Mahindra and other outsourcing companies use to bring skilled foreign workers into the country. (Reuters) The vice chairman at one of India’s largest technology services companies warned that US President Donald Trump’s visa policies will damage the industry as his company reported weak earnings and his stock fell the most in almost two years. Tech Mahindra Ltd. said net income was 5.9 billion rupees ($91 million) in the fourth quarter, compared with the average analyst estimate of 7.8 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Shares fell as much as 17 percent and traded 12 percent lower at 1:18 p.m. local time, the largest intraday decline since May 2015. The U.S. is tightening the criteria for visa programs that Tech Mahindra and other outsourcing companies use to bring skilled foreign workers into the country. Trump and other politicians have criticized the programs for hurting American workers and allowing companies to use cheaper employees from abroad. Also watch: “Trump’s America First agenda and focus on curbing the immigration, especially around H-1B visa policies, will hurt the IT sector,” Vice Chairman Vineet Nayyar said on a conference call. “The norms propose a radical shift in policies related to visa quotas and allotment, thereby, leading to a tougher application procedure and higher cost of Indian IT companies looking to bring talent to the United States.” Several analysts cut their ratings and price targets for Tech Mahindra after it reported results, including those at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley. Vibhor Singhal of Phillip Securities Pte reduced shares to a sell rating and slashed the price target to 380 rupees. Tech services companies, including Cognizant Technology Solutions, have been cutting positions in India. Some workers have blamed Trump for prompting the job losses and exacerbating problems in the industry. Workers have begun debating whether to form the first industrywide IT union. Trade unions are common in India in manufacturing and transportation, but they never had much success in information technology because pay and benefits had historically been good. “These are unsettling times in both in – on politics and economics of both Europe and U.S.,” said Nayyar. “However, the demand for technological services continues unabated. We do believe that as always, given our resilience, we will be able to see through – see our way through this current fog.” No Comments.
