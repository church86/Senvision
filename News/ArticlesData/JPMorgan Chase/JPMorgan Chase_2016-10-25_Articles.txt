John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 26, 2016 at 7:29PM JPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. A bet on bank stocks right now is a bet on interest rates -- or, more specially, on whether the Federal Reserve will increase the Fed Funds rate. What's the likelihood this will happen in the near future? If JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has his way, it should happen sooner rather than later. Dimon's comments Speaking at The Economic Club of Washington D.C. recently, Dimon fielded a question about whether the central bank should raise rates at one of its next meetings. Here's what the 60-year-old JPMorgan Chase executive had to say: Let's just raise rates. You don't want to be behind the eight ball on this. The Fed has to maintain credibility. Normality is a good thing not a bad thing. An economy that's been going like this for seven years is a good thing not a bad thing. So, to me, the return to normal is a good thing. The rate itself gets a lot more psychological attention than the actual economic effect of raising rates. Then, in response to a follow-up question about when the Fed should pull the trigger, Dimon responded: I'd go sooner rather than later, but I'll leave the exact timing up to them. They've made it clear that they're going to raise rates when they see the whites of their eyes; when they see the economy is strong enough. It's for this reason that Dimon thinks now, or rather at the Fed's meeting in December, is the time to raise rates. As he noted, the unemployment rate is down to 4.9%, inflation is ticking up, household formation is improving, and asset prices are up. In his opinion, then, the economy is strong enough to justify a move by the Fed to boost the benchmark Fed Funds rate, from which all other interest rates derive. What this would mean for banks It's worth keeping in mind that, even if the central bank were to raise rates at its next meeting, the increase would likely be minimal. Last December, when it did so for the first time since the financial crisis, it boosted the Fed Funds rate by a quarter of a percent, or 0.25%. That's a tiny improvement. But at the same time, it'd signal to investors that the Fed believes the economy is strong enough to withstand another hike. This has been far from a foregone conclusion over the past year, given the uncertainty in financial markets tied to slowing economic growth in China, concerns about the United Kingdom's pending exit from the European Union, and ultralow oil and gas prices that have made it hard for energy companies to service their bank loans. If the Fed were to follow Dimon's advice, the move would almost certainly cause bank stocks to climb sharply. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) in particular would be major beneficiaries of such an announcement. Shares of these two banks trade for substantial discounts to book value -- Bank of America for a 30% discount, and Citigroup for a 33% discount. And the principal reason they're so cheap is because low interest rates have made it all but impossible for them to meet their profitability targets. Consider this: according to Bank of America's latest quarterly regulatory filing, the nation's second biggest bank by assets would earn an added $7.5 billion in net interest income if rates rose 100 basis points. Citigroup's net interest income would climb $2 billion. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase's would get a $3 billion boost. Suffice it to say that this would make all three of these banks much more profitable, which would almost certainly then be reflected in higher share prices.

JPMorgan believes that an uneven consumer environment, difficult comparisons ahead, higher exposure to big ticket spending among a declining backdrop of consumer confidence, and a tougher promotional atmosphere foreshadows a tough road ahead for the home improvement retailer.

The article posted in October 2016 and written by Troutman Sanders lawyers Alan Wingfield, John Lynch, and Meagan Mihalko – all of whom represented Chase in the class action lawsuit – states that the case of Amanda Mix v. JPMorgan Chase (No. 2:15-cv-01102-JJT) has “important positive implications for banks conducting federally-required background checks on job applicants and employees.” The authors explain how Chase uses an “authorized FBI-channeler” to obtain FBI background checks “to comply with its own federal obligations governing employee qualifications” and that “the background checks were not governed by the FCRA” because both the FBI and FBI-channeler did not meet the definition of a “consumer reporting agency” that would indeed be regulated by the FCRA. Chase argued that the background checks “are not consumer reports because the channeler does not assemble or evaluate the information, but instead passes the unadulterated information from the FBI to Chase as a conduit.” The Court rejected arguments by the Plaintiff on why the background checks and channeler should be governed by the FCRA and adopted Chase’s position “that the FCRA did not apply.” The article explains that the Court found Chase demonstrated the “absence of a genuine dispute” as to whether their FBI-approved channeler is a CRA: Specifically, the Court reasoned that Chase’s approved channeler was “akin to an agent acting at the behest of its principals—[Chase] and the FBI; therefore, as an agent without control over its principals’ employment decisions [the channeler] is not a CRA.” The authors concluded: Banks operate under a number of federal requirements to conduct background checks on employees. This opinion confirms that FBI background checks, relied on by many financial institutions in accordance the federal requirements, may not be subject to the FCRA disclosure requirements, especially where they are conducted through the use of an authorized-FBI channeler. The opinion contains favorable law for consumer reporting agencies as well. The opinion lends support that the definitional inquiry into whether an entity acts as a consumer reporting agency should be determined on a transaction-based analysis, and therefore the fact that the entity has an affiliate, or itself, has FCRA-lines of business does not mean that every part of the business is subject to the FCRA.

 JPMorgan bankers have been barred from reading the Financial Times at work Will Martin Oct. 26, 2016, 10:19 AM 28,325 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getty Employees at the US investment bank JPMorgan can no longer access the online version of the Financial Times on work computers, the bank confirmed on Wednesday, citing the desire to "avoid a potential copyright concern." Bankers have been blocked from accessing the site since last week, a bank spokeswoman told Business Insider by email on Wednesday. Workers can still use their own personal devices to access FT articles but only if "they respect intellectual property rights outlined in our Code of Conduct," the statement added. JPMorgan employs 235,000 people globally, according to the bank's 2015 annual report. It is unclear exactly what the "potential copyright concern" involves, though Paul Murphy, the founding editor of the FT's Alphaville blog, wrote on the blog's Markets Live section: "Well, no — it's not a copyright row — it's cos they were sharing FT content around the JPM buildings, but not paying for a license." "Journalism costs money," he added. A Bloomberg report, which cited people familiar with the matter, said JPMorgan carried out the block because of fears that some employees may have breached copyright by copying and pasting text from FT articles and sharing it. The Financial Times declined to comment. The story was first reported on Twitter by Harry Wilson, The Times' city editor. The FT has a heavily paywalled online product, with group online subscriptions costing £336 ($410.57) a person, according to its website. On an individual basis, a premium digital subscription costs £7.75 ($9.47) a week, equivalent to £403 ($492.44) annually. Without a subscription, readers can access only a tiny proportion of the FT's content. NOW WATCH: These are the business skills you learn from being in a gang Loading video...

POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt reached out to Gensler for comment but didn’t hear anything back. The Warren wing of the party reacted in anger. From one senior figure in the progressive, Wall Street reform movement: “While the ‘Hill denizen’ is right that the Clintons returning to the White House is similar to the Roman Legions returning to Rome, they better include Gary Gensler in a very senior, genuinely powerful position or it will be like the historic defeat of the Roman Legions at the battle of Cannae. Gensler is a key symbol and dissing him will be a self-inflicted wound that will confirm Clinton is the untrustworthy, Janus-faced politician she has been accused of being for the last 2 years.” Story Continued Below BLANKFEIN ON BLANKFEIN — Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein spoke with David Rubenstein for the Carlyle Group co-CEO’s new Bloomberg show. The episode will appear [bloomberg.com/peertopeer]here by 9:00 a.m. and airs Wednesday evening at 8pm on Bloomberg TV. On why Goldman took big hits during the financial crisis: “We didn’t have a consumer business … [or] a relationship with the public … We managed our risk pretty well in that crisis … we came out relatively unscathed and looking like we needed to be punished in other ways” … On losing his beard during chemo treatments and growing it back: “It’s a sign of, I wouldn’t say victory, but it’s a sign that at least I’m gaining.” SHEILA BAIR: DITCH SUMMERS — POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt: “Former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairwoman Sheila Bair warned Hillary Clinton's nascent presidential campaign against taking advice from onetime Treasury Secretary Larry Summers because ‘the policies he has embraced have done a lot to help Wall Street but not much for Main Street’ according to documents from WikiLeaks. “The advice from Bair, who is now president of Washington College and served as an aide to former Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, should not have come as a surprise to the Clinton camp. … Bair and Summers played major roles in the government's response to the 2008 financial crisis, and she has been critical of the former Harvard president in the years since. In 2013, she helped torpedo Summers becoming Federal Reserve chair because of his participation in the "deregulatory cabal that got us into the 2008 financial crisis.” Read more. MAYBE DEMS WILL UNITE ON NOMINATIONS? — Better Markets CEO Dennis Kelleher doesn’t really buy the prognosis for huge intra-party fights should Clinton win: “Regarding nominations, with Republicans already focused on the 2018 Senate races and already stating their intent to make Clinton a one-term President, Clinton, Warren and all the Dems know that they have no margin for error and that a divisive fight over a nomination or two will doom their agenda. “Absent an historic level of political malpractice, that mutual self-interest (plus the Senate’s new 50 vote threshold for confirmation) should make this the smoothest nomination process in memory.” WALL STREET GIVES BIG IN 2016 — Via a new Americans for Financial Reform study: “During the current election cycle, Wall Street banks and financial interests have already reported spending more than $1.4 billion to influence decision-making in Washington … That total … works out to more than $2.3 million a day. More than 350 financial sector companies or trade associations spent at least $500,000 each during this period. “Individuals and entities associated with the financial sector reported making $798,137,857 in contributions to federal candidates for office during the current election cycle … The financial sector’s contributions were more than twice that of any other specific business sector … The financial industry reported spending $667,171,847 on lobbying in 2015 and 2016 through the second quarter.” Full report. THE BIG IDEA: WHY AT&T DEAL MAY GET BLOCKED — James B. Stewart in the NYT: “Opponents of the proposed AT&T purchase of Time Warner don’t want to just block the $85.4 billion deal: They want to overturn decades of antitrust policy and case law. Until recently, that would have been all but unthinkable. But in today’s superheated and politically charged environment, they may just succeed.” Read more.

In an interview focused largely on foreign policy, Trump said defeating Islamic State is a higher priority than persuading Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, playing down a long-held goal of U.S. policy. “Trump questioned how Clinton would negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin after demonizing him; blamed President Barack Obama for a downturn in U.S. relations with the Philippines under its new president, Rodrigo Duterte; bemoaned a lack of Republican unity behind his candidacy, and said he would easily win the election if the party leaders would support him” Read more. WELLS SPARKS NEW REGULATIONS — Bloomberg’s Jesse Hamilton: “To ensure Wells Fargo & Co.’s scandal over unauthorized customer accounts isn’t being repeated at other lenders, regulators are poised to start reviewing data and talking to employees inside the biggest U.S. banks, according to a person familiar with the matter. “Wells Fargo’s largest competitors have received regulators’ formal requests for information and have been preparing for their practices to be scrutinized by examiners in the coming days … Banks including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. have already been looking internally for any activities similar to those at Wells Fargo” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: Now delivering: Retirement security for life!

El-Erian on Bloomberg View: “The dollar has returned to highs it hasn't seen for nine months. The driver of this recent increase is similar to the cause of the currency's surge earlier this year. Yet, this time, the impact on financial markets has been quite different. And if this persists, the implications for Federal Reserve policy will also be different. “Traders have pushed the dollar higher based on their confidence of an approaching divergence in central bank policies … But in contrast to the earlier period, the impact on U.S. stocks has been very muted. … What is clear … is that the recent strengthening of the dollar is, as a standalone, unlikely to be a deterrent to a rate hike for the rest of this year. That is most likely in December rather than at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting next week” CLINTON CHAIR PLANNED FOR BIDEN — Business Insider’s Pamela Engel: “Hacked emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman showed how some of her top advisers reacted to speculation that Vice President Joe Biden might join the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. “The Clinton campaign emailed out a schedule that included a ‘Biden Plan meeting’ in late September 2015, around the time that speculation about Biden reached its peak.” Read more. APPLE BETS ON iPHONE 7 — WSJ’s Robert McMillan: “Apple Inc. posted its first annual revenue decline in 15 years, but projected a return to growth in the current quarter behind strong sales of its new iPhone 7. “Apple is running out of large untapped markets where it could reproduce its breakneck success in China in recent years. Sales in greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, declined 30 percent to $8.8 billion in the most-recent quarter. In the same quarter a year earlier, Apple sales to the region grew 99 percent.” Read more. CHINESE INFO SHARING RAISES CONCERNS — FT’s Charles Glover and Sherry Fei Ju: “China's largest internet companies have agreed to share data with government authorities in an effort to eliminate fake online reviews for services such as taxi rides and restaurants. “Despite the pro-consumer rhetoric, there were worries that tightening rules around online reviews and transactions would also help the government create more accurate online profiles of Chinese citizens. The NDRC would be compiling a “credit blacklist” as part of a “joint disciplinary scheme”, one official acknowledged.” Read more. AT&T’S LOBBYIST ARMY — NYT’s Cecilia Kang and Eric Lipton: “From the political right and the left, AT&T’s $85 billion bid for Time Warner has provoked pushback. But AT&T, in addition to its billions of dollars of capital, has another arsenal at its disposal: one of the most formidable lobbying operations in Washington. “The company’s list of nearly 100 registered lobbyists already on retainer in 2016 includes former members of Congress. AT&T is the biggest donor to federal lawmakers and their causes among cable and cellular telecommunications companies, with its employees and political action committee sending money to 374 of the House’s 435 members and 85 of the Senate’s 100 members this election cycle.” Read more. ARBS SKIP AT&T DEAL — WSJ’s Rob Copeland, Gunjan Banjeri and Liz Hoffman: “The once-mighty merger arbitrager has been humbled. Time Warner Inc. shares closed Tuesday some $20 a share below the price spelled out Saturday in AT&T’s $85 billion takeover bid. The big discount in Time Warner’s stock price means that an investor who buys the stock today and holds it would make around 17 percent annualized if the deal closes on schedule late next year. “Yet even at a time of ultralow interest rates and intense competitive pressure for investment returns, the tie-up is attracting little interest from Wall Street traders, thanks in part to concerns about potential regulatory action and lingering fear that the postcrisis stock-market boom could be on borrowed time. It is the latest sign that the once-lucrative field of betting on mergers isn’t the sure win it used to be. Wall Street is giving the deal just a 28 percent chance of closing at the stated terms as of Tuesday’s market close” Read more. GOOGLE FIBER CUTS STAFF — Bloomberg’s Mark Bergen: “Alphabet Inc.’s Access unit is cutting about 9 percent of its staff as it pulls back from an ambitious plan to spread high-speed internet service across many U.S. cities, according to a person familiar with the situation. “Craig Barratt, chief executive officer of Access, the Alphabet company that runs Google Fiber, announced his departure at a staff meeting on Tuesday. Barratt also wrote in a blog post that the company is pulling back fiber-to-the-home service from eight different cities where it had announced plans.” Read more. NEED CASH NOW? — Bloomberg’s Aaron Kirchfeld, Ruth David and Jan-Henrik Foerster: “Deutsche Bank AG, Europe’s biggest investment bank, is exploring alternatives to paying bonuses in cash as Chief Executive Officer John Cryan seeks to boost capital buffers and shore up investor confidence, according to people familiar with the matter. “Executives at the German lender have informally discussed options including giving some bankers shares in the non-core unit instead of cash bonuses, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. Another idea under review is replacing the cash component with more Deutsche Bank stock, they said.” Read more. EX-WELLS STAFF MAY GET JOBS BACK — FT’s Alistair Gray in New York: “Wells Fargo workers who were let go for failing to meet performance targets may be able to rejoin the bank, the new chief executive of the scandal-hit group said … as he apologised to the company’s workforce for its failures. Tim Sloan said the third-biggest US bank by assets had created a ‘special HR team’ to help some of those ‘who left retail banking for performance reasons’ apply for available positions. “The 5,300 employees who created the sham accounts over a five-year period are highly unlikely to get their jobs back. … However, former workers who did not turn to wrongdoing, and lost their jobs on performance grounds, may be ‘eligible for rehire’, Mr Sloan said. Wells would not say how many workers may qualify. In testimony on Capitol Hill last month, the bank’s former chief John Stumpf acknowledged there was ‘a lot of turnover’ at its retail business.” Read more. TRUMP KILLS BIG MONEY EVENTS — WP’s Sean Sullivan, Matea Gold and John Wagner: “Donald Trump’s campaign said Tuesday that it has scheduled no more big-money fundraising events to benefit the Republican Party, another sign of the GOP nominee’s struggling campaign and a serious blow to the party’s get-out-the-vote operations with less than two weeks to go until Election Day. “The consequences of halting major fundraisers will compound the challenges facing a candidate and a party already straining to match Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s much larger and better-financed operation. Unlike Clinton, who has an extensive turnout operation of her own, Trump and many other GOP candidates down the ballot are relying heavily on the Republican National Committee to bring voters to the polls” Read more. BIG STOCKS SOAR — Bloomberg: “These stocks are doing most of the work. The S&P 500 is sitting less than 2 percent off of its all-time high, much of it thanks to a few of the biggest companies in the index hitting new highs of their own. Only 14 stocks in the index touched new 52-week highs on Monday, but three of them are in the top five in terms of market cap, meaning they make up a larger portion of the index. “‘Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Facebook Inc., which rank as the second, third, and fifth largest publicly traded U.S. companies and represent more than $1.4 trillion market cap, all hit new 52-week highs yesterday,’ Bespoke Investment Group observed. ‘While overall market breadth hasn’t been bad, the largest stocks in the S&P 500 have definitely been doing a lot of the heavy lifting.’” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: As traditional pensions have disappeared, American workers have become more responsible for saving and preparing for their retirements. With longer lifespans, this often means saving for a longer retirement. These challenges have made planning and saving for retirement more difficult.

Investors are paying the most since early June to hedge against swings in the benchmark FTSE 100 Index relative to the regional Euro Stoxx 50 Index. The U.K. gauge, up 12 percent this year thanks to a slumping pound, has been hovering around 7,000 for most of the month, though it failed to maintain a record reached intraday on Oct. 11. It slipped 0.5 percent at 8:29 a.m. in London. Follow @Brexit for the latest news, and sign up to our Brexit Bulletin for a daily roundup. Traders are beginning to speculate on the form that Brexit will take, looking beyond the initial boost of a falling currency. Confidence in economic data, which surprised by how much they beat forecasts following the secession vote, is now giving way to inflation concerns, while economists are calling for the slowest quarterly expansion since 2012. JPMorgan Chase & Co. lowered its rating on U.K. shares this week, recommending instead to buy euro-area stocks. “Valuations became extremely stretched,” said Leigh Himsworth, who manages about $91 million of U.K. equities at Fidelity International in London. “When it comes to the economy, the reality of Brexit is really starting to kick in, and inflation is just one example of that. Nobody really knows what can happen. Investors need to work a lot harder to finds pockets of value.” As the pound tumbled to levels not seen since 1985, analysts estimated the FTSE 100 would benefit as its members get most of their revenue from abroad. They project company profits will slip just 0.8 percent this year, compared with a 8.5 percent contraction seen in June. But, since the index rallied to a record, strategists have begun saying the gains have gone too far. They’re calling for a 4.8 percent decline in the FTSE 100 from Tuesday’s close through the rest of the year, according to the average of nine forecasts compiled by Bloomberg. QuickTake Brexit JPMorgan, among the first to turn bullish on U.K. equities back in February, has cut its rating to neutral from overweight. The firm says investors may take any further drop in sterling negatively if politics become more uncertain, while an acceleration of inflation could hurt consumer stocks. With earnings expectations for British companies leaving little room for positive surprises, it’s time to switch to euro-area equities, down 5.5 percent this year, the bank said in an Oct. 24 note. As Prime Minister Theresa May prepares to start negotiations to leave the European Union, speculation has increased that by severing most ties to the common bloc, Britain will suffer. While data have stood up to the Brexit blow, a Bloomberg gauge tracking the degree to which the figures beat or miss forecasts has dropped to its lowest level since before the referendum. Economists forecast gross domestic product expanded 0.2 percent in the third quarter from 0.7 percent in the previous three months. That would mark a bigger slowdown than for any of Europe’s major economies and compares with the growth rate projected for Greece. And yet, even gauges of British mid- and small-cap shares reached record highs this month. The surge in the FTSE 100 pushed it to one of the best performances among developed markets this year, lifting its valuation to about 15 times estimated earnings, or 12 percent more than the multiple for the Euro Stoxx 50. But since mid-August, the cost of options on the British index has climbed 15 percent, while that of contracts on the European gauge has slipped, according to 30-day implied volatility data compiled by Bloomberg. Almost 44,000 bearish puts changed hands each day on average this month, the most since December 2014 and almost double the number of calls. “There is a 100 percent chance of leaving the European Union, and the FTSE valuation does not reflect that probability of a negative event,” said Ben Kumar, London-based investment manager at Seven Investment Management, which oversees about 10 billion pounds ($12 billion). “Europe has a lot further to bounce back.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

And you won't find a big gold statue of Prometheus. But when JPMorgan Chase opens its new Plano campus in 2018, the planners for the 1.4 million -square-foot project hopes to take some design cues from New York City's landmark Rockefeller Center. David Arena, head of global real estate for JPMorgan Chase told developers meeting in Dallas Tuesday that planners for Chase's new 6-building office campus near the Dallas North Tollway studied great urban landscapes when laying out the project which is part of the $3 billion Legacy West development. "At Legacy West we studied some of the best street thoroughfares in the world," Arena said at a meeting of the Urban Land Institute, the country's largest commercial real estate organization. "We more our less copied the distance at Rockefeller Center where the channel gardens are to try and create more animation and a streetscape." Designed by Dallas architect HKS, Chase's 49-acre campus just south of State Highway 121 includes office buildings, parking garages and open space. The channel gardens Arena referenced include landscaping, fountains and walkways and run between the high-rise buildings fronting on Fifth Avenue. Chase's new Plano campus - being developed by KDC - will house about 6,000 workers when it opens. Planners for Chase's new campus in Plano studied pedestrian areas in New York's Rockefeller Center.

There are multiple reasons to conclude that JPMorgan Chase is a great stock for beginning investors. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 25, 2016 at 12:42PM Chase Tower in Phoenix, Arizona. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Beginning investors should wade carefully into stocks, picking ones that minimize the risk of capital loss while at the same time offering a reasonable opportunity for future gains. One bank stock that meets this criteria is JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Why JPMorgan Chase is good for beginning investors With $2.5 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet, JPMorgan Chase is the biggest bank in America. This gives it the resources needed to stay on the cutting edge of the financial services industry, which is under assault right now from financial technology companies. JPMorgan Chase's heft also offers economies of scale -- the bigger a company is, the easier it is to operate efficiently. In the third quarter of this year, JPMorgan Chase's operating expenses consumed 59% of its net revenue. Most other banks tend to spend well over 60% of their revenue operating their businesses. Thanks in part to its size, moreover, JPMorgan Chase's stock is highly liquid. An average of 13.5 million of its shares have traded hands each day over the past three months. If you were to buy shares of the New York-based bank, you can thus rest assured that you won't have any problem subsequently unloading them. The 10 Biggest Banks in America from John J. Maxfield. JPMorgan Chase is one of the most stable banks in the United States, too. Its performance through the financial crisis confirmed this. While hundreds of banks failed in the downturn, and countless others would have failed but for the government's assistance, JPMorgan Chase was in such a strong position that it not only survived the crisis, but actually thrived because of it. In 2008, the government went to the Jamie Dimon-led bank and asked for its help in rescuing Bear Stearns, the fifth largest stand-alone investment bank at the time. Later that same year, JPMorgan Chase stepped in to rescue Washington Mutual as well, taking the by-then failed savings and loan institution off the FDIC's hands. Finally, though not unrelated to the first four points, JPMorgan Chase is very capably run. Its CEO, Dimon, may be the finest banker of this generation. And you needn't take my word for it. Warren Buffett has repeatedly expressed admiration for Dimon, calling the bank CEO's latest interview "off the charts." Not coincidentally, one of Buffett's lieutenants at Berkshire Hathaway recently joined the JPMorgan Chase board. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. Risks related to JPMorgan Chase stock There are of course risks associated with JPMorgan Chase. Regulators have expressed in the past that they want universal banks (banks such as JPMorgan with both investment and commercial banking operations) to simplify their business models. One way regulators are attempting to accomplish this is to put added regulatory pressure on the nation's biggest banks, which could thereby depress their profits. Along these same lines, banks that have major Wall Street operations, as JPMorgan Chase does, face heightened risk from their trading activities. JPMorgan Chase learned this first hand in 2012, when a single trader in its London offices lost over $6 billion by making a wrong-way bet on derivatives tied to the health of American corporations. That said, Dimon is reputed to be obsessive about risk, and, at least in my opinion, there's every reason to believe that the bank's mistake four years ago won't be repeated anytime soon. This means that the primary driver of JPMorgan's earnings going forward will be higher interest rates, which are bound to materialize at some point. In short, if you're looking for a good bank stock to buy as a beginning investor, you could do a whole lot worse than starting at the top with JPMorgan Chase.

Beginning investors should wade carefully into stocks, picking ones that minimize the risk of capital loss while at the same time offering a reasonable opportunity for future gains. One bank stock that meets this criteria is JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Why JPMorgan Chase is good for beginning investors With $2.5 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet, JPMorgan Chase is the biggest bank in America. This gives it the resources needed to stay on the cutting edge of the financial services industry, which is under assault right now from financial technology companies. JPMorgan Chase's heft also offers economies of scale -- the bigger a company is, the easier it is to operate efficiently. In the third quarter of this year, JPMorgan Chase's operating expenses consumed 59% of its net revenue. Most other banks tend to spend well over 60% of their revenue operating their businesses. Thanks in part to its size, moreover, JPMorgan Chase's stock is highly liquid. An average of 13.5 million of its shares have traded hands each day over the past three months. If you were to buy shares of the New York-based bank, you can thus rest assured that you won't have any problem subsequently unloading them. The 10 Biggest Banks in America from John J. Maxfield. JPMorgan Chase is one of the most stable banks in the United States, too. Its performance through the financial crisis confirmed this. While hundreds of banks failed in the downturn, and countless others would have failed but for the government's assistance, JPMorgan Chase was in such a strong position that it not only survived the crisis, but actually thrived because of it. In 2008, the government went to the Jamie Dimon-led bank and asked for its help in rescuing Bear Stearns, the fifth largest stand-alone investment bank at the time. Later that same year, JPMorgan Chase stepped in to rescue Washington Mutual as well, taking the by-then failed savings and loan institution off the FDIC's hands. Finally, though not unrelated to the first four points, JPMorgan Chase is very capably run. Its CEO, Dimon, may be the finest banker of this generation. And you needn't take my word for it. Warren Buffett has repeatedly expressed admiration for Dimon, calling the bank CEO's latest interview "off the charts." Not coincidentally, one of Buffett's lieutenants at Berkshire Hathaway recently joined the JPMorgan Chase board. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. Risks related to JPMorgan Chase stock There are of course risks associated with JPMorgan Chase. Regulators have expressed in the past that they want universal banks (banks such as JPMorgan with both investment and commercial banking operations) to simplify their business models. One way regulators are attempting to accomplish this is to put added regulatory pressure on the nation's biggest banks, which could thereby depress their profits. Along these same lines, banks that have major Wall Street operations, as JPMorgan Chase does, face heightened risk from their trading activities. JPMorgan Chase learned this first hand in 2012, when a single trader in its London offices lost over $6 billion by making a wrong-way bet on derivatives tied to the health of American corporations. That said, Dimon is reputed to be obsessive about risk, and, at least in my opinion, there's every reason to believe that the bank's mistake four years ago won't be repeated anytime soon. This means that the primary driver of JPMorgan's earnings going forward will be higher interest rates, which are bound to materialize at some point. In short, if you're looking for a good bank stock to buy as a beginning investor, you could do a whole lot worse than starting at the top with JPMorgan Chase.

Eric Volkman (TMFVolkman) Oct 25, 2016 at 6:25AM We're still some time away from the end of the year, but it's safe to say that 2016 probably won't be a banner year for banking stocks. Still-thin interest rates, fallout from the Brexit vote earlier this year, and concerns about consumer borrowing have dampened share prices in the sector. The recent Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) scandal hasn't helped the reputation of the sector, either. But the current unpopularity of banking stocks opens good opportunities to buy shares of some of the more solid lenders. Here are two banks I think are more than worthy of investment these days. Image source: Getty Images JPMorgan Chase Of the "big four" monster incumbent banks, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is best in class. Thanks to the Wells Fargo debacle, the company is now the largest of the quartet in terms of market capitalization in the U.S. JPMorgan Chase also tops the rest of the pack in terms of trailing 12-month revenue and net profit. The lender's key metrics are all going in the right direction. In its recently released Q3 results, it posted an encouraging 8% year-over-year improvement in total revenue (to almost $25 billion). Net profit dropped by the same amount (to nearly $6.3 billion), but that slide is on the back of a $2.2 billion tax benefit it booked in Q3 2015 that skews the comparison. Regardless, the resulting per-share net of $1.58 was well above the $1.39 expected by the market; the top line figure also beat estimates. Investment banking was the secret sauce flavoring those tasty results. JPMorgan Chase has one of the most robust IB operations among the incumbents. The segment is rather boom-and-bust -- and in Q3 it was very much the former, with the bank posting its best-ever Q3 revenue figure. To me, the company's investment banking arm isn't overwhelming relative to its size, so its downside is mitigated by the company's other operations. And when it does well, as it did this past quarter, the upside can juice overall results nicely. Finally, in a sector that can be fairly stingy with dividends, JPMorgan Chase pays out well. The company's distribution currently yields 2.8%, second only among the Big Four to beaten-down Wells Fargo, and notably higher than the payouts of Bank of America and Citigroup. Capital One Financial Over the years, Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) has grown from Yet Another Credit Card Issuer to a multifaceted financial services company. Although it still draws the bulk of its net revenue from card operations, those banking activities have grown to comprise nearly 40% of that line item these days. Auto loans in particular have been a good lending segment of late: On the back of growing vehicle sales, the company increased its originations by 20% on a year-over-year basis in its most recently reported quarter. Speaking of that period, although Capital One missed expectations for both net revenue and net profit, the former advanced a robust 10% (to $6.25 billion). And the 4% decline in adjusted bottom line wasn't too worrying, because the company still landed well in the black at $979 million. Total assets saw a 9% rise, while deposits went north at a 6% pace. The company's business mix is unique among the nation's top lenders, if not necessarily a hit with the market lately because of worries about credit card risk (and, to a lesser degree, the impact on auto lending from vehicle sales growth, which is starting to slow). Those concerns are valid, but in the card sphere I feel that Capital One is a veteran issuer that has proven its worth as a risk manager. As for auto loans, its originations are outpacing recent vehicle sales growth, so I'd fully expect the company to keep performing in that segment. Meanwhile, like JPMorgan Chase, Capital One doesn't skimp on the dividend. Its payout annualizes to $1.60, good enough for a 2.2% yield -- relatively generous for the banking sector.

Lee Guest Blog: Small Business Comments Email Print Detroit Economy Marvin Ward Jr. Recently, I attended an event in Detroit's West Village where J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. announced a $5 million investment toward the establishment of a $30 million Strategic Neighborhood Fund to drive inclusive economic growth in Detroit's neighborhoods. This initial $5 million grant is part of a larger investment across three neighborhoods — West Village, Southwest Detroit and Livernois/Six Mile — over the next five years and will continue to expand economic and neighborhood development beyond Midtown and downtown. While listening to the speakers, my mind turned toward Detroit's overall revitalization efforts; specifically, how this region compares to others when it comes to small business development and its role in the city's revitalization. I recently came across a study by the J.P. Morgan Chase Institute of expenditure levels by industry and categories. The Local Consumer Commerce Index, which was first released in "Profiles of Local Consumer Commerce: Insights from 12 Billion Transactions in 15 U.S. Metro Areas" in December, featured Detroit and 14 other major metropolitan areas. Each of these areas was selected based on the depth of the Chase customer market, the volume of total U.S. economic activity captured and geographic coverage. The most recent LCCI update included more than 16 billion transactions from more than 54 million customers. I discussed the report's findings with J.P. Morgan Chase Institute's Marvin Ward Jr., a research lead with the local Consumer Commerce research group, to better understand consumer expenditures and their impact and implications for our region. Lee: What are the key highlights from recent trends in the LCCI data for Detroit? Ward: Detroit consumer spending tracks the national picture remarkably well. While growth in Detroit is a little more volatile – spending slowdowns dip lower than the corresponding national slowdowns – the city has largely transitioned from higher year-over-year growth in 2014 to a lower year-over-year growth in 2015 and 2016. The growth that Detroit experienced has largely been driven by residents under 35 years of age. Lee: So younger consumers are driving spending growth? Ward: In June 2016, spending in Detroit by consumers under 35 increased by over 8 percent, while spending by consumers over 35 increased by less than 3.2 percent. From an income perspective, most of the growth has come from lower income people, who tend to be younger. Spending in Detroit by consumers in the top 20 percent of the income distribution shrank by 1.4 percent in June 2016. Lee: How does Detroit's local consumer spending growth compare to the nation? Any specific industries where Detroit spending outpaces the rest of the country? Ward: Detroit is different with respect to the kinds of businesses that are growing. For example, fuel spending stood out as starkly different in 2015. Detroit fuel sales lagged the national sales by over 2 percentage points at times, but this disparity seems to have settled out in 2016. Durable goods (for instance, home improvement, appliances and furniture) are a particularly notable story in 2016, insofar as spending growth at durable's retailers in Detroit outpaces national growth within the same category. These are useful data points, but they provide an incomplete picture. They can, however, help to calibrate the nuanced on-the-ground assessments of Detroit officials and residents. Lee: What sets Detroit apart from the other cities and how are the suburban areas doing relative to spending growth? Ward: In addition to differences in the kinds of places consumers spend, Detroit seems to be departing from the spatial patterns of growth seen in the rest of the sample. Detroit has seen a volatile, yet probable, increase in spending growth from customers who live outside of the city, but within the metro area. Growth from the suburban portion of the metro area contributed virtually nothing to growth in January 2016. By June, the suburbs contributed 2.4 percentage points to overall growth. This suburban growth profile departs from trends in the other 14 metro areas we observe. Lee: How are consumers in Detroit spending at small businesses? What are the key trends and their implications? Ward: Small businesses have contributed more to overall growth in Detroit than medium and large businesses since the close of 2014. In 2014, Detroit lagged behind other cities with respect to small business growth, but it seems to have made up that ground. In fact, small businesses in Detroit are actually growing slightly faster than small businesses nationally. By contrast, medium-size businesses seem to be doing better elsewhere. Lee: So small business growth is, in fact, playing a major part in Detroit's revitalization. Ward: Small businesses appear to be a major component of revitalization in Detroit. This suggests that entrepreneurs continue to see Detroit as an attractive place to start a business. Lee: What types of consumer spending might indicate an improvement in the local economy? Ward: Detroit has seen consistently positive economic growth in recent years, but that growth has varied by industry. There are those who argue restaurants serve as a useful leading indicator of economic improvement. The rationale underlying this claim suggests that restaurants are a luxury that consumers engage when extra disposable cash is available. If this is the case, it is worth noting that Detroit has seen notably consistent year-over-year growth in spending at restaurants. Since late 2014, restaurants have contributed more to growth in each month than any other type of retail or service business we observe. Lee: Other key implications from the study? Ward: A robust economy needs growth in other sectors as well. Furthermore, strong medium and large firms need strong commercial ecosystems to support their work. That means a deep labor market that has a robust mix of low- and high-skilled workers, well-functioning infrastructure and a growing population that can spark additional demand for local goods and services. Detroit does seem to be making these investments, but the results of efforts to build this ecosystem can take time to materialize.

Photographer: Wang Zhao/AFP via Getty Images Housing curbs will drive funds into equities: JPMorgan Asset Shanghai Composite heads for biggest monthly gain since March Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp China’s speculative investors may finally be contemplating a return to stocks. That’s according to JPMorgan Asset Management, which has been buying mainland shares in a bet that a real-estate lending crackdown and lower valuations will draw investors to equities, more than a year after a rout that wiped out $5 trillion in value. Chinese shares are beginning to perk up, with the benchmark Shanghai index headed for its best month since March. Investors spending borrowed cash drove the stock boom and bust last year, before fleeing to bonds, commodity futures and, most recently, real estate. Average new-home prices in 70 cities surged the most in more than seven years in September amid a credit boom, Bloomberg calculations based on official data show. With at least 21 cities imposing curbs, the housing market is showing tentative signs of cooling, improving the relative attraction of stocks that are among the world’s worst performers this year. “They’ve underperformed every other asset class for a period of time by a shocking margin," said Howard Wang, Hong Kong-based head of greater China for JPMorgan Asset Management, which manages about $1.6 trillion. “The money that would have gone into property will find its way into equities." Since the People’s Bank of China started easing monetary policy in November 2014, various Chinese asset classes have seen bouts of strong inflows, which often prompted regulators to step in to slow price gains -- and investors to move their money elsewhere. Even before that, regulators had to impose curbs to avert a potential housing bubble in 2011, and speculators have also targeted everything from garlic to certain types of tea. After a string of Chinese cities imposed property curbs and measures limiting financing for developers, new-home prices dropped in the first weeks of October in Beijing and Shanghai. The Shanghai Composite Index is up 3.7 percent this month and rose on Tuesday to the highest close since January, even as the yuan extended declines to a six-year low and the cost of borrowing short-term funds in China’s money market jumped. Speculative Investment “If you don’t let me buy property, but I have a lot of money, some people speculate -- and we agree -- people will just put it back in the stock market," said Kevin Leung, director for global investment strategy at Haitong International Securities Group Ltd. in Hong Kong. "It’s underperformed all markets." Analysts at Citigroup Inc. also say the property curbs will buoy stocks. It’s a good time to buy shares in Chinese brokers because households will move funds to equities as housing measures tighten and bond prices are likely to peak, the U.S. bank said this month. China’s 10-year sovereign debt yield fell to a record low just last week, while the Shanghai Composite is trading at price-to-earnings ratio of about 18, down from 25 at its peak last year. Likely inclusion in MSCI Inc.’s benchmark measures next year will also draw more foreign funds, according to Haitong’s Leung. The index firm said last month it’s continuing to monitor whether to add mainland shares to its gauges. ‘Entrenched Disbelief’ Some analysts doubt that interest in shares will return. Homes and stocks are not interchangeable, said Hao Hong, chief strategist at Bocom International Holdings Co. in Hong Kong, who predicted last year’s equity boom and bust. Economists are also seeing receding chances of aggressive monetary stimulus, which sparked the 2015 stock rally, and turnover in China’s two public equity markets remains tepid. “There’s an entrenched disbelief in the stock market," said Hong. “If you ask me what it’s going to take for people to go back, I would say a sustainable recovery. When the momentum comes back, people will chase it." For JPMorgan Asset Management’s Wang, the key is for the government to cool the property market -- but just by a little. It may take three to six months for a strong equity rebound to begin as investors assess the impact of the housing curbs, he said. “If we end up in the base case, which is that liquidity dries up, i.e. volumes fall, but you do not get a major price correction, it may end up redirecting liquidity into equities," he said, referring to a decline in the number of housing transactions. “If they get it wrong and cause a huge correction, then all bets are off. Then money will come out of a lot of the asset classes." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

By Ben White and Andrew Hanna 10/25/16 08:00 AM EDT GENSLER NOT GETTING A GIG? — MM hears that a senior Democrat on Capitol Hill has been assuring bank lobbyists that former CFTC Chair (and ex-Goldman Sachs exec and current Hillary Clinton campaign aide) Gary Gensler will probably not be getting a top spot in a potential Clinton administration. Progressives who love Gensler are not exactly thrilled with this. They are looking for Gensler to get a top spot in the West Wing or Treasury. But word going around the Hill is that Gensler will only get a “second tier” position. THE JOCKEYING — One Hill denizen noted that while Obama came to Washington with very little in the way of baggage and sprawling networks, Clinton has so many that “her coming to power is like the Roman Legions coming home.” Story Continued Below NO REPATRIATION? — In a other sign of the Dem on Dem violence to come should Clinton win, former Senate aide Tyler Gellasch emails: “As banks and corporations keep handicapping a repatriation tax holiday, the unassailable evidence from the 2004 holiday is that it was a complete disaster. “I don't think rewarding corporations who have avoided billions of taxes at the expense of the rest of us is likely high on Progressives' wish list. For the more moderate folks, it would be a bit cynical for a new Democratic Senate majority and President to agree on something that polls more than 70 percent against them.” HRC/WARREN LOVE … FOR NOW — Haroon Khan of the Federal Resources Group emails: “Interesting remarks by Sec Clinton today while campaigning with Senator Warren in NH. I wonder if she will have the same feeling as President particularly once the nomination process gears up.” He was referring to this from Clinton: “Some of the best TV you can see is on C-Span when Elizabeth going after a bank executive or a regulator. She is refusing to let them off the hook and she is not just speaking for herself, she is speaking for every single American who is frustrated and fed up. I am so looking forward to working with her to rewrite the rules of our economy … ” MORE ON TRUMP/CLINTON PLANS — Via the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget: “According to our findings, neither candidate would significantly increase economic growth to the 3 percent, 4 percent, or 5 percent growth levels hinted. Clinton would likely quicken growth because of her immigration reform while Trump would likely slow growth for the same reason. … “[W]when immigration reform is accounted for, we expect Clinton's plan to increase average real Gross Domestic Product growth from about 2.0 percent per year to 2.3 percent, while Trump's plan could reduce it to as low as 1.7 percent. Importantly, these estimates do not account for the candidates' trade, regulatory, or energy plans, all of which could further impact economic growth” Read more. BAYH MET WITH BANK LOBBYISTS DURING BAILOUT VOTE — POLITICO’s John Bresnahan: “Former Indiana senator and longtime Banking Committee member Evan Bayh held a series of private meetings with financial service industry executives and lobbyists throughout 2008 — just as Wall Street was collapsing and big banks were seeking a bailout from Washington, according to a newly obtained schedule for the ex-lawmaker now running to reclaim his seat. One of the engagements — which included lunches, dinners and golf outings — happened the day of the Wall Street bailout vote. “On Oct. 1, 2008, when the Senate voted to approve the $700 billion rescue package, Bayh held a ‘Lunch with Supporters’ that included lobbyists for the financial services industry, his schedule shows. Other meetings with industry lobbyists and officials took place in the weeks and months up to and following the bailout vote” Read more. LOVE YOU TOO, JOHN! — Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta in an email to communications director Jennifer Palmieri in July of last year with the subject line “Being a crazy person”: “Just read Ben White's piece in Politico on the speech. It was a joke. I think we might need to go postal on the press.” See the email. Here's the story that got Podesta so steamed up. MORE FROM WIKILEAKS: THE COURTING OF BOB WOLF — This appears to be from an exchange between Podesta and Clinton about Robert Wolf, a Wall Street exec and close confidante to President Obama. Podesta: “I think you may be seeing him today and wanted to let you know where his head is at. I spent an hour with him on Tuesday. I saw him a few days earlier at David Brock's book party and had heard he was cranky so asked if I could come see him. He wasn't so much cranky as trying to figure out where, if anywhere, he fits in the campaign. He has a super close relationship with Obama … . “He's not expecting that, but hoping that he could have some direct relationship with you and that the campaign would seek his views on economic issues. He raises money, but hopes that he isn't just connected to the campaign only as a fundraiser and only through Dennis. … Most importantly, Biden is courting him hard … All these guys are kind of pains in the ass in their own ways, but I find Robert pretty nice, pretty easy, and pretty smart.” GOOD TUESDAY MORNING — Officially just two weeks from Election Day!

FRIENDS NOW/FRENEMIES LATER — POLITICO’sAnnie Karni: “This could be the ending of a beautiful friendship. Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren, dressed in matching jewel-toned pantsuits, touted each other’s virtues Monday … The happy rally represented an evolution for the two all-stars of the Democratic party. Clinton and Warren entered the campaign season as wary competitors who had never forged a personal bond during their overlapping years in power in Washington, D.C. “But there’s tension on the horizon: If Clinton wins, Warren has promised to rattle the gates of a Clinton White House — as she did to President Barack Obama — pushing for progressive, anti-Wall Street crusaders to fill posts as top economic advisers and, most importantly to her of all, treasury secretary. Warren and her staffers have already been feeding to the Clinton campaign lists of individuals they would consider appropriate for those posts — and signaling in unsubtle terms those whose appointment they would fight to block” Read more. SCRUTINIZER IN CHIEF — NYT’s Amy Chozick and Matt Flegenheimer: “[L]iberal Democrats are already looking past Election Day — and relying on Ms. Warren to become the thorn in chief in Mrs. Clinton’s side, scrutinizing her appointments and agenda. Mrs. Clinton has vowed that if elected she will work across the aisle with congressional Republicans, but relations with liberals, including Ms. Warren of Massachusetts and Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, could prove quite contentious” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: Now delivering: Retirement security for life!

Learn more at: http://irionline.org/agenda. ** WEISS ON TREASURY TRANSPARENCY — POLITICO’s Patrick Temple-West: “The public needs more information about the U.S. government debt being bought and sold, but precautions need to be taken to keep businesses from getting burned by too much sunlight, a U.S. Treasury Department official said … ‘Trading in our nation's debt should be transparent to the public,’ Antonio Weiss, counselor to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, said at a New York Federal Reserve conference … ‘All significant participants in the Treasury market should be subject to comprehensive oversight and trade-reporting requirements.’ “But Weiss said regulators' desire for more Treasury transparency should accommodate businesses' concerns about possible disruptions to the market. ‘Transparency is not all or nothing, and one size may not fit all segments of the Treasury market,’ Weiss said. ‘We have heard the concerns regarding potential risks of increased transparency and believe that design is key.’” Full speech. MET LIFE VS FSOC — Compass Point’s Isaac Boltansky: “[T]he U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard oral arguments in MetLife v. FSOC. Lawyers from both sides faced pointed, and relatively detailed, questions from Judges Millett (Clinton appointee), Randolph (H.W. Bush appointee), and Srinivasan (Clinton appointee). “While it is dangerous to read too deeply into questions from the bench, our sense is the oral arguments in MetLife v. FSOC broke very slightly in favor of the government. Judge Randolph's questioning regarding cost-benefit analyses suggested sympathy for MetLife’s arguments. Questions from Judges Millett and Srinivasan suggested conceptual support for the FSOC’s unique position in the regulatory ecosystem, but stopped short of signaling a wholehearted acceptance of the government's position” TRUMP DOESN’T GET TRADE — Consumer Technology President Gary Shapiro in U.S. News: “In reality, any decline in manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has virtually nothing to do with competition from abroad and everything to do with a massive increase in productivity through the use of technology. … “Trump has also made a habit of attacking technology companies, such as Apple, openly suggesting that as president, he would strong-arm the company to build all its products in the U.S. What Trump doesn't say — or, more than likely, doesn't know — is that such a draconian move would do little to create jobs in America and would only result in vastly increased prices for Apple products to U.S. consumers.” Read more. CITI LOSES GROUND — TheStreet’s Brad Keoun: “As the largest U.S. banks race to reinvent themselves amid an onslaught of new regulations, Citigroup is falling behind. ‘On a key measure of profitability, Citigroup lags behind the other five big U.S. banks — and is barely halfway toward its own goal. During the first nine months of this year, the New York-based lender's return on tangible equity was just 7.7 percent, well behind the 14 percent at Wells Fargo and 13 percent at JPMorgan Chase. Citigroup has set a long-term goal in the "mid-teens," while refusing to set a timeline.” Read more. TWITTER PLANS JOB CUTS — Bloomberg’s Sarah Frier: “Twitter Inc. is planning widespread job cuts, to be announced as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter. “The company may cut about 8 percent of the workforce, or about 300 people, the same percentage it did last year when co-founder Jack Dorsey took over as chief executive officer, the people said. Planning for the cuts is still fluid and the number could change, they added. The people asked not to be identified talking about private company plans.” Read more. WELLS ADS BLITZ — FT’s Alistair Grey: “Wells Fargo is launching a television advertising campaign as part of a push by the bank’s new chief executive Tim Sloan to rebuild a brand damaged by the scandal over faked accounts. “The commercials, scheduled to begin on Monday evening, stop short of apologising for the debacle but tell viewers that the bank is ‘making changes to make things right’.” Read more. OBAMACARE COSTS TO RISE — FT’s Barney Jopson: “Health insurance costs under Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms will jump by an average of 25 per cent next year as the president’s signature initiative — which was designed to bring down costs for consumers — is undermined by growing problems. “The US Department of Health and Human Services said premiums for the most popular plans would rise by an average of 25 per cent, although the change in cost for many consumers would be less dramatic because the figure does not take account of government subsidies.” Read more. PROGRESSIVES PLAY LONG GAME — InsideSources’ Carter Dougherty: “Far from hankering for a fight similar to the one that torpedoed the nomination of a senior Treasury Department official in 2014, Democratic lefties and their outside allies are eyeing a complex process that doesn’t over-emphasize the importance of any single nomination. “With Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, at the center of the fight, progressives are also guarding against Clinton keeping power in the hands of White House staff or other appointees not confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The emphasis, say people close to the effort, is on the overall profile of her administration.” Read more. FRANCE CLEARS CALAIS — NYT’s Maurico Lima and Adam Nossiter: “Hundreds of migrants, mostly young men from Africa or Afghanistan, lined up in the cold on Monday for buses to take them to temporary housing all over France, as the government set in motion a plan in the port of Calais to clear the sprawling migrant camp known as the Jungle once and for all. “The squalid camp, growing and festering for over a year, has become a symbol of Europe’s faltering efforts to handle its migration crisis. Before Monday’s operation, the camp’s population was 6,000 to 8,000.” Read more. CHINA CHECKS INTO HILTON — Reuters’ Ankit Ajmera: “Chinese aviation and shipping conglomerate HNA Group said on Monday it would buy about 25 percent of hotel operator and manager Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc from biggest shareholder Blackstone Group LP for $6.5 billion “The deal will allow the HNA Group to appoint two directors to Hilton's board, raising its size to 10.” Read more.

PHOTO: REUTERS Oct 27, 2016 6:43 AM [NEW YORK] A Florida man with ties to an illegal Bitcoin exchange that was allegedly used by hackers who targeted companies including JPMorgan Chase & Co is scheduled to plead guilty to undisclosed charges Thursday. US prosecutors asked a judge in New York to hold a hearing for Michael Murgio, the father of the bitcoin exchange operator, Anthony Murgio. Michael Murgio's lawyer, Stuart Kaplan, confirmed his client intends to plead guilty at the hearing. Prosecutors have said the hacking ring, which targeted publishing and financial firms that also included Dow Jones & Co, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, engaged in pump-and-dump stock scams and online gambling, generating hundreds of millions of dollars.

Like us on Facebook. Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now Developers building Plano's $3 billion Legacy West project say it has happened in less the half the time of their most optimistic projections. "When we started, our aggressive forecast was six years, moderate was seven and the conservative was nine or ten years to build it," said Steve Van Amburgh, CEO of developer KDC, one of the partners in the 255-acre project. "We have 11 acres left in less than 2.5 years." Legacy West's developers on Wednesday  showed the project off to commercial real estate execs from around the country in Dallas for a meeting of the Urban Land Institute, the industry's largest trade group. The mixed-use development at the southwest corner of the Dallas North Tollway and State Highway 121 is the biggest real estate project under construction in Texas with more than 5 million square feet being constructed at once.. New corporate campuses are being developed for Toyota, JPMorgan Chase and Liberty Mutual Insurance. "Legacy West if it is not number one in the U.S., it's somewhere up there," Van Amburgh said. "This is truly a unique, unusually large and successful project. "It just so happened at the time we put the venture together, a lot of big companies were looking," he said. "It doesn't happen very often." Developers Karahan Cos., KDC and Columbus Realty kicked off development on Legacy West just over two years ago. The first business - FedEx Office - has already moved into the development. "There will be 21,000 people working in Legacy West by the end of next year," Columbus CEO Robert Shaw said. He's already begun leasing the first of 800 apartments under cosntruciton in the project. "We are killing it - knocking it out of the park," Shaw said. "We are having a great lease up already and the jobs are not there yet." The first shops and restaurants will open in March. The developers say they almost totally redesigned the huge project when Toyota decided two years ago to relocate its North American headquarters from southern California to Plano. 'Toyota was the one that was sort of the game changer," Van Amburgh said. "The minute they announced it woke up all these corporate groups . "If they are going to have first class facilities and retain and recruit employees they need to be in the same type of location," he said. "That's what happens when somebody like Toyota comes to town - it creates a tremendous amount of economic development in a hurry." The builders made Legacy West more dense and added more retail and apartments after Toyota landed. "Once we knew we had this many blue chip companies coming to our development we deiced to alter our retail plans," Karahan said. "Before we didn't have this big of a retail component. "We made it more modern and dense." He said retailers are paying comparable rents to Dallas' Uptown district. "We haven't signed any leases less than $50 per square foot," Karahan said. "Some of them are in the $60s. "These are rental rates we would not have thought we'd achieve in that market but we are. " Karahan said he does not consider Legacy West as a suburban project. "What we created is an urban destination - that's what attracted all these companies," Karahan said. He met this week with the global real estate exec for Chase who toured the development site. "He said tell me how many minute walk from my front door to the food hall you are building," Karahan said. "He wanted to know - that was most important." He doesn't think Legacy West will be impacted other mixed-use projects in the works further north on the tollway in Frisco's so called $5 billion mile. "Some of the announced projects I highly doubt will happen," Karahan said. "Everything you see on that rendering for Legacy West is being built." The first shops and restaurants open in the $500 million Legacy West Urban Village in March.

In a Wednesday securities filing, São Paulo-based JBS said that BNDES Participações SA, the investment arm of Brazil's state development bank BNDES , opposed the plan, which included separating the company's global operations and moving them to Ireland. BNDES did not explain why it challenged the reorganization plan, JBS Chief Executive Officer Wesley Batista told analysts on a call from Colorado. A BNDES representative said the state agency will comment later on Wednesday. "The bank thought it was not the best road ahead for the company," said Batista, adding that the current shareholder agreement with BNDES would end in 2019, which would then free it to reorganize operations. Shares of the world's No. 1 meatpacker plunged nearly 18 percent on Wednesday, the most in eight years, signaling frustration with the end of a plan aimed at accelerating JBS's growth, reducing fundraising costs, optimizing taxes and attracting a wider base of investors. "This is a major negative surprise. The listing process had already been moving since May and a veto from this shareholder was totally unexpected," said Pedro Leduc, an analyst with JPMorgan Securities. BNDESPar holds 20 percent of JBS, making it the company's No. 2 shareholder, after the Batista family's 45 percent stake. Batista said there were alternatives to the reorganization but did not elaborate, except to say that listing North American assets on the New York Stock Exchange was one possibility. The region is the biggest source of revenue for JBS globally. Under terms of the plan proposed in May, the JBS Foods International unit was to be listed in New York. Investors saw the move as the best way for JBS to become the first Brazilian multinational with a clear division of local and global assets. The billionaire Batista brothers Wesley and Joesley, who are JBS's CEO and chairman, respectively, expected the reorganization to be ready by November. CHANGE OF COMMAND The company's shares fell as much as 17.6 percent to 9.72 reais in São Paulo, their biggest drop since Oct. 15, 2008, cutting into their gains this year. Since the reorganization was announced, JBS had risen 43 percent. The reorganization was devised before a new Brazilian government swapped the senior management of BNDES. President Michel Temer tapped economist Maria Silvia Bastos to run BNDES and BNDESPar, replacing Luciano Coutinho, who was for years seen as a supporter of the Batistas' push to internationalize JBS. The idea of splitting Brazil-based and global assets gained traction because most of JBS's revenues now come from overseas units, especially from North America. According to people with knowledge of the situation, executives had told investors in several road shows promoting the reorganization that BNDESPar was on board with the plan. Abandoning the reorganization plan comes at a time when JBS has fallen under increased scrutiny from prosecutors and government auditors for allegedly providing Brazil's former ruling Workers Party with illegal donations in the 2014 presidential campaign. JBS denied making any undeclared donations to the party or ruling coalition allies. JBS had hired the investment-banking units of Morgan Stanley & Co and Banco Santander Brasil SA to structure the deal, with law firms White & Case LLP and Mattos Filho Advogados as legal advisers.

The third-largest public school system in the United States will sell up to $840 million of general obligation bonds through Barclays and JP Morgan Securities to fund capital improvements using a $45 million property tax hike approved by the Chicago City Council last year. The district will also restructure up to $160 million of variable-rate bonds into a fixed-rate mode through a yet-to-be-announced underwriting team. Emily Bittner, a Chicago Public Schools (CPS) spokeswoman, said earlier this week that market conditions will dictate when the deals will be priced. CPS is struggling with pension payments that will jump to about $720 million this fiscal year from $676 million in fiscal 2016, as well as drained reserves and debt dependency. As a result, the district's credit ratings have fallen deeper into the junk category, most recently with a downgrade from Moody's Investors Service. The muni market has demanded fat yields for CPS debt. Even a private sale of $150 million of 30-year GO bonds by CPS in July to J.P. Morgan came at a 7.25 percent yield, which was 513 basis points over the yield for AAA-rated bonds on Municipal Market Data's (MMD) benchmark scale. Meanwhile, uncertainties lurk for CPS. A proposed four-year contract that averted a teachers' strike earlier this month is scheduled for a ratification vote by Chicago Teachers Union members next week. New money for classrooms under the tentative deal will flow from a nonrecurring revenue source - surplus property taxes generated by city economic development districts. The school district's $5.46 billion operating budget includes a one-time, $215 million state of Illinois pension contribution that is contingent on the legislature's passage of major state-wide pension reforms by January.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Oh Snap Snapchat Could Be Worth $40 Billion When It Goes Public Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Oh Snap Snapchat Could Be Worth $40 Billion When It Goes Public The company is seeking to raise up to $4 billion in an I.P.O. by Maya KosoffOctober 26, 2016 4:35 pm Email Facebook Twitter Photograph by Justin Bishop. Snapchat, which is expected to go public in early 2017, is hoping to raise as much as $4 billion in an I.P.O., Bloomberg reports. While the details of the company’s plans haven’t been made public, sources told the outlet that Snapchat could reach a valuation of $25 billion-$35 billion, and potentially as much as $40 billion. The Los Angeles–based video-messaging start-up, which changed its corporate name to Snap Inc. earlier this year, previously picked Morgan Stanley, which led an earlier round of the company’s debt financing, and Goldman Sachs to lead its I.P.O., according to Bloomberg. Credit Suisse, Barclays, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank, and Allen & Co. will also all be joint book runners. Evan Spiegel has been clear about his intentions to take his five-year-old company public. “We need to I.P.O., we have a plan to do that,” the 26-year-old C.E.O. said at Recode’s annual Code Conference in 2015. “An I.P.O. is really important.” Now, Snapchat appears to be in a good position to do so: while Snapchat brought in only $59 million last year, according to a leaked pitch deck, the ephemeral photo and video-messaging platform expects to reach revenues of between $500 million and $1 billion next year—an estimate shared by analysts. Snap has also recently gotten into the hardware game, with plans to begin selling Snapchat-enabled “Spectacles” in addition to generating revenue from ads. Spiegel has been preparing for an I.P.O. in other ways, too. Earlier this year, the company hired Stan Meresman, a veteran adviser to companies seeking to go public, and listed him as a board member. When Snapchat rebranded itself as a camera company and changed the name of its parent company to Snap, it used its Web site to hint at its ambitions about becoming a public company. “Changing our name also has another benefit: when you search for our products it will be easier to find relevant product information rather than boring company information or financial analysis,” Spiegel said in a blog post. “You can search Snapchat or Spectacles for the fun stuff and leave Snap Inc. for the Wall Street crowd :).” Share Email Facebook Twitter Maya KosoffMaya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com, with a focus on start-ups and venture capital.

Passporting, which allows London-based lenders and insurance companies to sell their services anywhere in the single market, is unlikely to continue after the U.K. leaves the 28-nation bloc, Mark Garnier said in an interview. He added that an alternative system that’s been floated, known as equivalence, was probably not going to be "good enough" for banks. Mark Garnier Photographer: Jason Alden/Bloomberg Garnier, who is also government envoy for financial services, instead touted a better version of equivalence that might work well for London-based banks. The drawback is that Britain may have to accept all future EU regulations as they are handed down from Brussels, he said. Resentment toward EU bureaucracy and a backlash against immigration were drivers behind the June referendum. “If we can create a special hybrid version of that, with a better version of equivalence or a different version of passporting, then that’s what we will try to achieve,” Garnier said by phone. “What we are not trying to do is fit into an existing box. We are trying to create a new model.” Asked if this meant passporting was likely to end but would hopefully be replaced with something else, he said: "Exactly." Click here for a guide to what passporting rights mean for banks. Twitter: Bloomberg Brexit on Twitter As the government gears up for tough talks with the EU, it’s also facing pressure at home. The opposition Labour Party will push for full access to the single market and resist what it calls a “ Bankers’ Brexit,” the chief voice for economic policy, John McDonnell, will say on Thursday. McDonnell, who shadows the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer, says the government is favoring financial industries over the needs of manufacturers and small businesses, according to prepared remarks released by his office ahead of a speech in London. The Tories “want to turn Britain into a Singapore of the North Atlantic,” McDonnell will say. At stake is conserving a key motor of the British economy that contributes about 10 percent of gross domestic product. Finance executives have threatened to move staff out of the U.K. if Prime Minister Theresa May’s team of Brexit negotiators doesn’t secure a deal allowing them to serve European clients from London. Global investment banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley have the most to lose as they operate European business out of London and don’t have the same links to the continent as local lenders such as Societe Generale SA and Deutsche Bank AG. The British Bankers’ Association warned that leading lenders are poised to press "the relocate button" in early 2017. Garnier stressed that no “hard and fast” plans had been made on what form of deal would be made. With negotiations due to begin before the end of March, pressure has been mounting for the government to provide more clarity, particularly to banks, to avoid a possible exodus of business from the City of London. The government’s stock response has been that it does not intend to provide a running commentary on its thinking though there has been a charm offensive to improve communication and reassure the finance world that its interests won’t be ignored. An explainer about why Brexit could trigger an exodus of banks from London. Garnier elaborated on why the system known as equivalence, whereby London-based banks could keep operating in the single market if British and EU financial rules are compatible, “wouldn’t necessarily work.” Many international banks, he said, would regard this equivalence with suspicion because the status can be withdrawn at 30-days notice. “It is entirely possible that we will just have to adopt the rules of the EU as they come down with regards to financial regulation,” he said. A new arrangement along these lines would depend, he added, on creating “the right dialogue” to craft a system that works for both the U.K. and the EU. Inflation Woes Follow @Brexit for the latest news, and sign up to our Brexit Bulletin for a daily roundup. Apart from preserving London as a financial hub, another consideration for the government is the pound’s slump since the Brexit vote. While ministers have argued it is a boost for exporters, others have highlighted the impact it could have on consumers at home by driving up prices. Garnier agrees that inflation is “just inevitable.” A row broke out earlier this month when Tesco, the country’s largest supermarket, halted online sales of Marmite, after the maker of the savory spread, Unilever, said they wanted to increase the price due to the fall in the value of sterling. “We have had Marmageddon,” Garnier said. “Consumers are going to start to see rising prices and there’s nothing we can do about that. That was a well-predicted effect of Brexit. The point was very clearly made by everybody: Brexit could easily result in a slump in the value of sterling. That has transpired.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

 Snapchat aims to raise $4 billion when it IPOs next year Alex Heath Oct. 26, 2016, 3:49 PM 23,658 facebook linkedin twitter email print Snap CEO Evan Spiegel. Larry Busacca/Getty Images for Time Inc Snapchat's parent company, Snap Inc., is aiming to raise "as much as $4 billion" when it goes public early next year, according to a Wednesday report from Bloomberg's Alex Barinka and Sarah Frier. A source previously told Business Insider that Snap plans to go public by late March at around a $25 billion valuation, but now Bloomberg is saying that number could swell as high as $35 billion or even $40 billion. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs will lead the deal, while JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Allen & Co., Barclays, and Credit Suisse will be joint bookrunners. The Los Angeles-based company last raised $1.81 billion in private funding in May, which pegged its valuation at between $18 billion and $22 billion. Raising $4 billion on the public market would put Snap well behind Facebook's $16 billion IPO raise in 2012 and ahead of Twitter's $1.82 billion in 2013. Snap has told investors that it expects to make between $250 million and $350 million in advertising revenue this year. A recent eMarketer report predicted the company would near $1 billion in revenue in 2017 — meaning an IPO that valued the company at $35 billion would be 35 times its projected revenue numbers. By comparison, Facebook was estimated to make $5 billion in ad revenue the same year it went public at a $104 billion valuation. With annual revenue under $1 billion now, Snap could file its Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the JOBS Act. In such a scenario, the initial filing would be confidential.

Photograph: Richard Drew/AP Graham Ruddick Wednesday 26 October 2016 14.12 EDT Last modified on Wednesday 26 October 2016 17.00 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Goldman Sachs featured prominently in the headlines this year, even before the leak this week of Theresa May’s pre-EU referendum speech to staff at the investment bank. The New York-based bank has been dragged into the BHS scandal, the bitter run-up to the US presidential election and the furore over the appointment of the former European commission president José Manuel Barroso as chairman of Goldman Sachs International. The high court in London also heard allegations in June that Goldman bankers paid for prostitutes, private jets and five-star hotels, and held meetings on yachts to win business from a Libyan investment fund set up under the Gaddafi regime. These allegations were part of a $1.2bn claim against Goldman by the Libyan Investment Authority, which said the bank duped it into signing deals it did not understand. The high court ruled in Goldman’s favour this month. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Theresa May’s private Brexit warning speech to Goldman Sachs – audio The prime minister spoke in May at the investment bank’s “Talks at GS” series. The list of past speakers at these Goldman Sachs events has highlighted the company’s allure and influence in London and other financial centres around the world. According to Goldman’s website, the “Talks at GS” involve the bank inviting “leading thinkers from a broad range of backgrounds to share their views and expertise”. As well as May, who spoke at Goldman on 26 May, other speakers have included Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue, Eddie Jones, the England rugby union coach, and Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury. The investment bank is not the biggest in the world (that title belongs to JP Morgan Chase based on their respective stock market values) but Goldman consistently tops the global league table for the number of mergers and acquisitions it has worked on, and its alumni have ended up in some of the most powerful jobs in the world. It was infamously described by Rolling Stone magazine in 2010 as a “great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money”. Former Goldman employees who have moved on to high-profile positions in public life include Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, Hank Paulson, the former US treasury secretary, and Malcolm Turnbull, the Australian prime minister. In the UK, Jim O’Neill, the former chief economist of Goldman Sachs, had been a Treasury minister in the Conservative government until his resignation last month, while Paul Deighton, the former chief operating officer in Europe, was commercial secretary to the Treasury under George Osborne and has just been named chairman of Heathrow airport. Howard Wheeldon, a veteran analyst in the City, claimed Goldman was perceived as a “cut above the rest”. He added: “It is informed and always one step ahead of its peers, quiet and yet super efficient, influential because it creates knowledge required, always up with events and yet, by the same token, invisible to its peers. There simply is no one better – the Rolls-Royce of global investment banking.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hillary Clinton was paid $675,000 for speeches to Goldman employees and clients. Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP Another City source said there was a business adage that “no one ever got fired for hiring Goldman Sachs”. Goldman is renowned for its discretion and secrecy, appreciated by wealthy clients looking for someone to manage their money or a company working on a big acquisition. So the bank will have been disappointed to find its name in the news in relation to the British prime minister, particularly because the story was leaked from within the bank and involved a secret event held behind closed doors. A spokesman for Goldman declined to comment when asked if the company was investigating the source of the leak. The bank was involved in a similar controversy with Hillary Clinton this year after it emerged the US Democratic presidential candidate was paid $675,000 for speeches to Goldman employees and clients. Clinton did not reveal the details of her speeches, but WikiLeaks released transcripts in October that showed she had avoided directly criticising Wall Street. Two of Goldman’s most senior employees in Europe – Michael Sherwood and Anthony Gutman – were also summoned before MPs in June as part of a parliamentary investigation into the demise of the retailer BHS. Goldman had offered informal advice to Sir Philip Green before he sold BHS to Dominic Chappell. It warned that Chappell, a billionaire tycoon, had been declared bankrupt in the past and that the deal could be risky – a warning that came true when BHS folded this year. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Sherwood, vice-chair at Goldman Sachs, appeared before MPs in June as part of a parliamentary investigation into the BHS collapse. Photograph: PA Sherwood and Gutman found the public hearing and inquiries into Goldman’s business practices awkward. At one stage, Michelle Thomson, the SNP MP, even said: “Mr Sherwood, I have been keeping quiet to this point, but I have been sitting watching everyone’s faces and, if you don’t mind my saying, you look somewhat uncomfortable.” But the parliamentary appearance of two senior Goldman figures also provided a unique insight into how the investment bank does business, including its determination to stay close to leading clients. “Goldman Sachs is slightly different from other firms,” Sherwood told MPs. “Our starting account size is larger and we are really in the high net worth business and that is all. We are in the business where we cover large corporations, high net worth individuals, governments. They may not do things for a very long period of time, but, at particular times in their lifecycle, they might do significant transactions and we want to be in the goalmouth when those things happen.” More news Topics Goldman Sachs Banking Theresa May BHS Sir Philip Green More… José Manuel Barroso Mark Carney Mario Draghi George Osborne EU referendum and Brexit Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story Why Theresa May shared her Brexit fears with Goldman Sachs The prime minister may be regretting her remarks, but the bank has boosted its reputation for powerful connections Published: 28 Oct 2016 Why Theresa May shared her Brexit fears with Goldman Sachs Theresa May under fire for secret talk of Brexit fears After the Guardian published leaked audio of her speech to Goldman Sachs, politicians from the UK and across Europe have criticised the prime minister Published: 26 Oct 2016 Theresa May under fire for secret talk of Brexit fears Tories want a Brexit deal for themselves, not the many - John McDonnell Shadow chancellor to warn that Theresa May’s apparent U-turn over Heathrow expansion shows she cannot be trusted to keep Brexit promises Published: 27 Oct 2016 Tories want a Brexit deal for themselves, not the many - John McDonnell Businesses are rightly frustrated with Theresa May's Brexit handling Graham Ruddick PM revealed her true thoughts on leaving the EU in a private speech – GM and Morgan Stanley have shown they agree Published: 26 Oct 2016 Businesses are rightly frustrated with Theresa May's Brexit handling The Goldman Sachs tape shows May is not leading on Brexit, but following Anne Perkins Published: 26 Oct 2016 The Goldman Sachs tape shows May is not leading on Brexit, but following The lesson from tiny Wallonia – there is a way to prevent hard Brexit Simon Jenkins Published: 26 Oct 2016 The lesson from tiny Wallonia – there is a way to prevent hard Brexit The Guardian view on Theresa May’s shifting view of what Brexit means Published: 26 Oct 2016 The Guardian view on Theresa May’s shifting view of what Brexit means Theresa May's private Brexit warning speech to Goldman Sachs – audio Published: 25 Oct 2016 Theresa May's private Brexit warning speech to Goldman Sachs – audio More more on this story most viewed The Guardian back to top home election 2016 US world opinion sports soccer tech arts lifestyle fashion business selected travel environment all sections close home election 2016 US world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business selected economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK skiing environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed video Business › Goldman Sachs Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us contact us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2016 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Tuesday November 15, 2016 Analysis Argentina Community Economy World Culture Media Sports English on the Side   Wednesday, October 26, 2016 US ‘closing in on Venezuelan asset seizures’ An oil worker walks past a drilling rig at a well operated by Venezuela’s state oil company PDVSA in Morichal. By Ben Bartenstein, Tiffany Kary & Alan Katz Bloomberg Federal prosecutors preparing to charge individuals over alleged looting of state oil firm US Federal prosecutors are preparing to charge several individuals and confiscate their property over the alleged looting of Venezuela’s state oil company in what may amount to one of the biggest asset seizures in the history of the United States. Three people familiar with the case say the government has been investigating at least a dozen Venezuelans and is expected to file charges in Houston against a few of them as soon as next month. Those on the list, including former executives of Petroleos de Venezuela, known as PDVSA, are suspected of having taken bribes from middlemen to award contracts at inflated prices, helping to siphon more than US$11 billion out of the country. All three people spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing and sensitive due to its impact on US foreign policy. The government has set its sights on a number of US assets, including about 20 residential properties, some in West Palm Beach and the Houston suburbs. Venezuela’s opposition-run Congress is separately seeking to recover US$11.3 billion that went missing from PDVSA between 2004 and 2014 while Rafael Ramírez, currently Venezuela’s ambassador to the United Nations, was company president. It seeks to hold him politically responsible. Ramírez has rejected the congressional accusations as lies. Investigators are also looking at the dealings involving PDVSA and a number of companies, including Pratt & Whitney, General Electric and Rolls Royce Holdings, as well as ProEnergy Services, a Missouri-based firm, two of the people said. The prosecutors have been tracking money that flowed through Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, they added. A Pratt & Whitney spokesperson declined to comment and noted that its power systems business, which operated in Venezuela, was divested in June 2013 and became PW Power Systems. PW Power Systems did not respond to requests for comment. The other three companies declined to comment, as did all three banks and PDVSA. The banks handled transactions through accounts held by the individuals who transferred some of their gains out of the country, two of the people said. Money-laundering controls may not have caught transactions done through shell companies, they said. The people under investigation include current Venezuelan government officials, prominent businessmen and individuals suspected of involvement with cocaine-trafficking, two of the people said. Homeland Security Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI are all involved in the investigation, which has been under way for at least three years and looks at activity going back to 2005. Comment declined The FBI declined comment, as did the DEA, the US Justice Department, Homeland Security Investigations and the US Attorney’s office in Houston. The investigation comes at a time when the cost of corruption is vividly apparent in Venezuela’s crumbling economy. A former finance minister, Jorge Giordani, has said that as much as US$300 billion was embezzled from Venezuela in the last decade through high-level corruption. Meanwhile, hunger is spreading in a country that was once one of the world’s wealthiest. Struggling to avoid default, PDVSA on Monday reached an agreement with some creditors to push back bond maturities. In response to the national crisis, the opposition has sought a voter signature drive aimed at recalling President Nicolás Maduro. Last week the National Electoral Council, which is run by Maduro loyalists, suspended that effort. On Sunday, the opposition accused the president of carrying out a coup and vowed to try to replace key figures on the Supreme Court and electoral council and appeal to the International Criminal Court. Washington’s interest The US has a strong legal interest in the case because the allegedly ill-gotten money passed through its banks and was used to buy property here. The people under investigation have been linked to billions of dollars of gains, much of which was transferred to offshore accounts in Panama, the people said. The US would seize homes and properties — many of them worth tens of millions each — as well as private jets and other assets to create a fund that would eventually be returned to the Venezuelan government after a democratic election, one of the people said. Ricardo Hausmann, a Venezuelan economist at Harvard who would like to see the current government replaced, said US leadership in this area could prove important. “If the US were to say, ‘We’ve identified billions of dollars,’ it would have a devastating political effect at home with Venezuela’s current government,” he said. Washington would also earn goodwill if it later returned any stolen funds, he added. Javier Corrales, a political scientist at Amherst College, said that in dealing with Venezuela the US has made a point of sanctioning individuals rather than the government as a whole. Some within law enforcement have nonetheless alleged that the Obama administration is dragging its feet in pursuing Venezuelan officials because of its desire to avoid a political and economic implosion there and to help negotiate a soft landing from the current crisis. Corrales said that while political interference may play a role in the sealing of some indictments, the US government largely lets its justice system do its work. PDVSA’s US affiliate that handles international purchasing is in Houston, where the US recently prosecuted a case which investigators say resembles this one. Roberto Rincón Fernández, a Venezuelan national living there, took part in a US$1-billion bribery scheme to secure contracts with PDVSA. He pleaded guilty to two counts, including conspiracy to violate corruption laws. Ever since the leftist party of Hugo Chávez was elected in 1998, Venezuela has allied itself with historic opponents of the US, including Cuba and Iran. The US accuses Venezuela of allowing itself to be used as a route for illegal drugs and of failing to adhere to international counter-narcotics agreements. Two nephews of President Maduro arrested in Haiti are being held in the US on charges that they were involved in a drug-trafficking ring. They have denied it. A US State Department official said they are cooperating. @benbartenstein, @tiffanykary, @alanrkatz Size email Print Share Vote Tweets por @BAHeraldcom Get to File LATEST NEWS MOST POPULAR BEST RANKED Recent releases Six Utah high school students stabbed, including teen suspect President Macri meets with Peronist governors Photo gallery: Largest full moon in nearly seven decades Samsung to buy car tech firm Harman for $8 billion President Macri meets with Peronist governors Six Utah high school students stabbed, including teen suspect                     Edition No. 5015 - This publication is a property of NEFIR S.A. -RNPI Nº 5293935 - Issn 1852 - 9224 - Te. 4349-1500 - San Juan 141 , (C1063ACY) CABA

The first estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product – a broad snapshot of how the economy performed in the months since the Brexit referendum – could have implications for the Bank of England, swing the mood of consumers and provide a tool for politicians pushing their view on how tough to be when it comes to actually removing the U.K. from the EU. “This is an extremely high stakes report – the British economy appears to have been surprisingly resilient to the Brexit upset,” said Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management. “To be clear, some economic damage is still expected, if not of a recession-inducing magnitude.” Economists forecast a 0.3 percent pace, with some, including Royal Bank of Scotland, JPMorgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, going even higher. While that would be a slowdown from 0.7 percent, it is a far cry from the recession some warned about before the referendum. For government members who say the U.K. can prosper outside the EU and should take a hard line in exit talks, such an outturn may encourage them to push their agenda harder. For the more cautious, they may be able to point to detail showing the skew of growth, with one sector doing all the heavy lifting. Here’s the breakdown since 2014: Household consumption, which is strongly correlated with services, is also a huge part of the U.K. engine but there’s a risk its momentum may wane if the weaker pound pushes up inflation and wage growth doesn’t keep pace. After a six-year squeeze on their pockets, households have only enjoyed two years of real income growth, and there are signs already that it’s fading. All of this will feed into the thinking at the BOE on whether another interest-rate cut will be needed to help the economy. Governor Mark Carney and the Monetary Policy Committee have begun their formal deliberations on Wednesday for their Nov. 3 announcement. “A solid, if unspectacular, growth figure for the third quarter would probably be the final nail in the coffin of a further reduction in interest rates this year,” said Dan Hanson, an economist at Bloomberg Intelligence in London. “That’s not to say more action won’t come next year. The data flow is likely to deteriorate in 2017 and prompt a cut to 0.1 percent in February.”  The third quarter is only a snapshot and questions remain over the longer-term outlook. For now though, that snapshot will have our attention. It all kicks off at 9:30 a.m. London time on Thursday, when the Office for National Statistics releases its data.
