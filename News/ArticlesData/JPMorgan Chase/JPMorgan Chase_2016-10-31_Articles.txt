These Wall Street Honchos Hardly Ever Use Email Money 11/1/2016 Olivia Oran / Reuters © CNBC—NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Jamie Dimon, chairman, president and CEO of JP Morgan Chase In an age when most bankers use keyboards to communicate with each other, a small group of the Wall Street elite refuses to say anything substantive in an email, text or chat, and some will not communicate digitally at all. Quotes in the article Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRK.B ▼ 157.46 -0.47 -0.30% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 79.36 -0.15 -0.19% This group, which includes top bankers like JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and powerful investors like Carl Icahn and Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s Warren Buffett, were eschewing electronic communications long before the probe of U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s emails and the recent hacks of her campaign manager’s account made headlines. Some on Wall Street are nostalgic for a time when in-person conversations or phone calls were the norm, but others believe the words they type and send can come back to haunt them. Prosecutors have built insider trading, mortgage fraud and rate-rigging cases on embarrassing emails over the past several years, and they are often the most memorable part. Recent email woes among Washington power players have provided yet another reason for bankers to try to protect private correspondence from prying eyes. Dimon uses email but is known to keep his replies short and factual, favoring “yes,” “no” and “thank you.” That behavior was evident in company emails released by a U.S. Senate committee investigating JPMorgan’s $6.2 billion “London Whale” derivatives trading loss. In one message, Dimon replied with a simple “I approve,” showing some responsibility but giving no sense of how deeply he was involved with the decision to change risk tolerances at the bank. After hearing a passing reference to regrettable emails during an interview at a conference two years ago, Dimon volunteered: “Don’t send emails after you’ve had a drink.” A JPMorgan spokesman would not comment further. Other top investors like Icahn and Buffett rely on their assistants to send and receive messages. Buffett’s assistant, Debbie Bosanek, prints out emails for the billionaire investor. Although the investors are averse to two-way digital correspondence, both blast out carefully curated messages on their Twitter accounts, with Icahn attracting 304,000 followers and Buffet, 1.2 million.

Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website 5  +   =  nine Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Whether or not you love Wall Street, Jamie Dimon has proven a capable CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) since he took the helm in 2006… As of 2015, Dimon has produced a 111% shareholder return since becoming CEO. And he led JPMorgan through one of the worst financial crises since the Great Depression. Part of Dimon's success is owed to his unique skillset and leadership style. Here's what we mean… 5 Things You Didn't Know About Jamie Dimon 1) Dimon accepted full responsibility for the 2012 London Whale crisis. Jamie Dimon Fact Sheet Born: March 13, 1956 (age 60); New York City, New York Pay Package: $27 million (2016) Net Worth: $1.1 billion (June 2015) Political Party: Democratic Board Member Of: Federal Reserve Bank of New York Religion: Greek Orthodox Spouse: Judith Kent Children: Julia Dimon, Laura Dimon, Kara Leigh Dimon Alma Mater: Tufts University, Harvard University Good leaders know better than to pass off the responsibility of big mistakes to their underlings — that's a mistake former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf should be able to attest to. In this case, a trader-gone-wild named Bruno Iksil (AKA the London Whale) helped run up esoteric credit default swap bets that cost the bank over $6 billion in 2012. It was a major embarrassment for Dimon, who later said the strategy was "flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed, and poorly monitored," according to The Wall Street Journal on May 11. What's worse, the trades took place in a unit that reported directly to Dimon. Rather than craftily dismissing his oversight — or easier yet, blaming Iksil — Dimon took full responsibility. In testimony to Congress, he told Sen. Jeff Merkley that "we made a mistake. I am absolutely responsible. The buck stops with me," according to Vanity Fair in November 2012.

You can start today with our top 5 money-making investment reports – they're absolutely free… 2) Dimon saved Bear Sterns and 300,000 jobs at Washington Mutual. In March 2008, Bear Sterns, a financial firm that heavily traded mortgage-backed securities, was on the brink of failure. To prevent it from collapsing, Dimon led JPMorgan to buy the company for $29 billion. JPMorgan assumed all of Sterns' risky exposures. Later in 2008, JPMorgan did the same with Washington Mutual, saving thousands of jobs. At the time, no other institution wanted to take over these risky and dangerous financial firms. But Dimon stepped up to the plate, and in doing so, he helped save the financial industry from collapsing. As a side note, because Dimon took over the balance sheets of these troubled banks, he also had to pay a $13 billion settlement with the Department of Justice for those firms' misdeeds. Don't Miss: A Special Profit Opportunity with Only Days Left to Get the Details 3) Dimon steered JPMorgan Chase away from peddling mortgage-backed securities (MBS) before the 2008 financial crisis.  While most other big banks like Bear Sterns, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs were making risky MBS trades, JPMorgan was not. In fact, it was one of the few investment banks that largely discouraged the practice before the financial crisis, which is how it was able to absorb troubled firms during the crux of the debacle. Dimon was undoubtedly the major hand behind restricting his traders from being tempted by MBS trades. In 2006, he was credited for ordering his bank's chief of securitized products to deleverage more than $12 billion worth of subprime mortgages. 4) Despite having a net worth over $1.1 billion, Dimon is not an "extravagant man." According to those who work closely with Dimon, he doesn't live like a typical big bank CEO, Vanity Fair reported in November 2015. Heidi Miller, once listed by America Banker as one of the most powerful women in banking, worked for Dimon for 18 years. In an interview with Vanity Fair, she recounted: "I swear, if his wife didn't point out shirts that match his suits, I'm not sure what he would look like in the morning, half the time. I always think of him as somewhat rumpled. He is oblivious to the trappings of very fancy things." Dimon is not a member of the ritzy Augusta National Golf Club, unlike his two predecessors at JPMorgan Chase. In fact, he doesn't even play golf, Vanity Fair reports. During his five years living in Chicago from 2000 to 2005, when he was the CEO of Bank One Corporation, Dimon didn't attend a single black-tie charity event, despite expectations that he should as a corporate leader, according to Vanity Fair. And in 2004, after the merger of Bank One and JPMorgan Chase, Dimon spent his two-week vacation at a weekend house in Bedford, New York. He was alone, making his own coffee and perusing around the local Target in his wrangler jeans, Vanity Fair reported. Continue reading to see our No. 5 fact about Dimon that you might not expect. This quality of Dimon's is one of the reasons JPMorgan was so prepared going into the 2008 Financial Crisis, relative to other big banks. 5) Dimon runs JPMorgan with a conservative business approach.

One company to target: Palo Alto Networks. By Steven M. Sears Biography October 29, 2016 Five years ago, then-FBI head Robert Mueller made a chilling observation about the Internet. “I am convinced,” he said in a speech, “that there are only two types of companies: those that have been hacked and those that will be. And even they are converging into one category: companies that have been hacked and will be hacked again.” So many companies have since been hacked that it’s hard to compile a comprehensive list.

This story is part of Where the Jobs Are Amazon to hire 4,000 seasonal workers in Delaware 6 companies bringing jobs to New Castle Macy's to hire 300 seasonal staff at Delaware locations starting Friday OpenBracket brings high-tech talent to Delaware Scott Goss , The News Journal 9:35 a.m. EDT November 1, 2016 Buy Photo Greg Furlong studies computer programming at Zip Code Wilmington in 2015. After earning a top ranking for Java developers globally, Furlong was hired by JPMorgan Chase in December for its two-year technology training program. (Photo: DANIEL SATO/THE NEWS JOURNAL)Buy Photo Getting some of the best and brightest computer programmers in the country to consider a job in Wilmington can be a challenge, at best. Even the biggest city in the nation’s second smallest state barely rates against more alluring destinations such as Boston, New York City and Silicon Valley. Throw in a few Murder Town headlines and selling young coders on the city can seem near impossible. That’s why some of the leading voices in Delaware’s burgeoning tech scene are turning to the promise of bragging rights and cash prizes. And it appears to be working. Nearly 200 programmers from around the country are expected to put their skills to the test during this weekend’s finals of the inaugural OpenBracket Delaware coding competition at the Grand. STORY: Delaware jobless rate holds for third-straight month STORY: Delaware public records gold mine: new open data portal The live problem-solving challenges devised by the Palo Alto startup HackerRank will begin Friday afternoon and continue through a Saturday evening block party on Wilmington’s Market Street. “There’s going to be two bands, a light show and just real party atmosphere,” said lead organizer Ben duPont, an entrepreneur and venture capitalist. “We want this to be as cool as possible to really showcase what the city has to offer.” While the coders will be competing for a $15,000 grand prize, some of the state’s top financial institutions will be competing for them. Sponsors such as JPMorgan Chase Co., Chatham Financial and Capital One are planning to host events at restaurants along Market Street where they plan to pitch themselves to the assembled whiz kids. “We are viewing this as a prime opportunity for our technology recruiting efforts,” JPMorgan spokesman Paul Hartwick said. “We’re not only sponsoring events that can help spotlight career opportunities at our company, but we’re also trying to showcase parts of Wilmington, such as the Lower Market area, that people might not otherwise experience.” Delaware entrepreneur and venture capitalist Ben duPont  (Photo: NEW CASTLE COUNTY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE) Events like OpenBracket Delaware are examples of Wall Street’s new tech meritocracy. Financial institutions traditionally coveted graduates from Stanford and other big-name schools along with people already working in Silicon Valley. But that system tends to overlook good programmers from anywhere else, including gifted dropouts. Banks also need to fill so many programming jobs that elite schools can’t possibly pump out enough candidates. So the industry is turning to outside firms to evaluate prospective programmers based on objective measurements, not their pedigree. The idea is that people lacking a computer science degree and still make the leap to well-paid careers in technology. Gregory Furlong, for example, spent five years working 50-hour weeks as a shipping clerk at a local Best Buy. It was a kind of employment purgatory for a computer obsessive who tinkers with motherboards in his free time. So the 30-year-old enrolled in Zip Code Wilmington, a 12-week coding boot camp co-founded by duPont. The school’s coursework incorporates HackerRank, a web platform that trains and grades people on writing computer code. After earning a top ranking for Java developers globally, Furlong was hired by JPMorgan Chase in December for its two-year technology training program. By using algorithms to spot talented coders, HackerRank and its competitors promise to suss out talent in the rough like Fulong. “This is purely about skill,” said 28-year-old Vivek Ravisankar, a HackerRank co-founder who used to work for Amazon.com. “Most really good programmers learn on their own and just continue to build their skills. Probably the really good programmers are college dropouts.” The service is part of a broader trend among U.S. corporations to bring data rigor into recruitment, instead of relying only on resumes and interviews. “Finding people through alternate channels, we weren’t doing that five years ago,” said Michael Zbranak, a managing director in JPMorgan’s global technology division. “Now we absolutely do it, because we’ve seen it work.” There are at least 500,000 technology workers at banks globally, and about 10 percent have to be replaced annually due to attrition, according to Chris Skinner, a London-based technology consultant to financial firms. JPMorgan, with more than 40,000 technology workers, hires thousands annually just to replace those who depart.

The firm announced in late 2015 it will add 1,800 Delaware jobs by 2019.  (Photo: SUCHAT PEDERSON/THE NEWS JOURNAL) HackerRank is free for coders and makes money from fees from corporate clients. Users perform challenges and watch video tutorials to sharpen their skills in specific coding languages such as Java; solving harder problems results in higher rankings. They can also join contests set up by employers with challenges related to jobs they want to fill. Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and hedge fund Two Sigma are among HackerRank clients. Finance firms aren’t the only ones who need help finding coders. Other clients include retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and medical products maker Stryker Corp. BlackRock uses HackerRank to evaluate each of the several hundred programmers hired annually to work on improvements to its critical Aladdin software, the investment and risk-management platform that handles $15 trillion in assets. “The old way of doing things is you cast a wide net, you get a bunch of resumes, you start screening through the resumes manually, and you hope the person looking at them is doing a good job,” said Sunil Dalal, chief operating officer of the Aladdin product group. “There’s a lot left to luck.” Programmers are especially ripe for merit hiring. They usually can’t show recruiters the code they created for past employers because of proprietary reasons, so in the past they’ve been judged solely by their resumes, Ravisankar said. The opaqueness of that talent market in turn created bidding wars for graduates from schools like Stanford or top tech firms, discounting coders from elsewhere, he said. Ravisankar and Hari Karunanidhi, a former IBM Corp. engineer, started HackerRank four years ago. Working in India, the pair struggled with two failed business plans until they landed on using algorithms to evaluate programmers’ code. In 2012, they were accepted into a Silicon Valley startup incubator, and soon clients included West Coast technology firms Twitter, Yelp and Dropbox. The firm, which has a million users globally, has raised almost $28 million in funding. HackerRanks’ competition model has certainly caught on with programmers. More than 7,000 coders applied to compete in OpenBracket’s initial online trials last month. Less than half of the prospective competitors were able to complete the intensive logic problems. But about 35 recorded a perfect score. Those programmers and about 150 others were offered stipends of $200 to $500 to attend the finals in Wilmington this weekend. “Ideally, we want these jobs to be filled with students from University of Delaware, Wilmington University and Zip Code Wilmington,” duPont said. “But it also doesn’t hurt if we can get these folks to move here and help establish Wilmington as a world-class coding and software technology hub.” Bloomberg reporters Hugh Son and Dakin Campbell contributed to this story.

How Zcash Tries to Balance Privacy, Transparency in Blockchain By Lalita Clozel October 31, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related  Enlarge This Image Banks' Privacy Concerns Shaping Blockchain Vendors' Strategies Can You Really 'Know' a Customer Who Uses Bitcoin? They Might Be Smart, But These Contracts Need to Be More Secure Restoring Privacy for Banks on the Blockchain (podcast) Wells Fargo's Gift to Late Night Eight Times Stumpf Was Hammered by Senators Who to Watch as Regulators Size Up Online Lending WASHINGTON — Zcash, the cryptocurrency that debuted last week, promises transactional privacy on an open blockchain. That could make distributed-ledger technology more appealing to financial institutions, but perhaps less so for regulators. The blockchain — the shared-ledger system pioneered in bitcoin — is often touted as a more efficient, transparent and resilient way to record transactions. A major sticking point for financial institutions, however, is that such a system gives every user access to the basic details of every transaction that has been conducted on it. "If you're JPMorgan, you can see all of Credit Suisse's books, and neither JPMorgan nor Credit Suisse is comfortable with that degree of transparency," said Peter Van Valkenburgh, the research director at Coin Center, a cryptocurrency advocacy group in Washington. With Zcash, the software developer Zooko Wilcox offers a solution to this problem. If the technology works as envisioned, it could not only make blockchains more palatable for banks but help resolve long-simmering tensions between anti-money-laundering regulations, which demand transparency, and financial privacy. What remains to be seen is how governments will view a system where transactions are auditable but disclosure is under the participants' control. Starting with the same basic framework as bitcoin, Wilcox added a recent cryptographic innovation, called the zero-knowledge proof, to the blockchain. This system allows users to conduct private transactions while maintaining the integrity of the blockchain that supports them. As in bitcoin, users are identified by pseudonymous addresses. Those alphanumeric strings alone do not guarantee privacy, since the flow of funds can be traced through the blockchain and addresses controlled by the same user can be linked. In Zcash, there are two types of addresses, "transparent" and "shielded." The transparent addresses and the amounts sent to and from them show up on the blockchain as they would in bitcoin. But if a user opts to use a shielded address, it will be obscured on the public ledger. And if both the sender and receiver of funds have opted to use shielded addresses, the amount sent will be encrypted as well. Eventually, the Zcash development team will add "view keys" that users will be able to share with third parties to reveal information about their own transactions — though not anybody else's. "We call this 'selective disclosure,' " Wilcox said in a statement to American Banker. "It also comes with an encrypted memo field, which allows institutions to safely attach sensitive data to transactions, and make that information visible to authorized parties." Otherwise, the blockchain operates normally; the ledger knows that the amount of funds in the system before and after each transaction remains the same. What a zero-knowledge proof "potentially gives you is the ability for you to prove something about a data structure without revealing the data inside the data structure," Van Valkenburgh said. For banks intrigued by blockchains but leery of volatile, decentralized digital currencies, Wilcox's company, Zcash Electric Coin Co., is developing enterprise software that would add an encryption layer to a private shared ledger. It's called ZSL, for Zcash Security Layer — Wilcox has likened it to Secure Sockets Layer, the encryption technology developed in the mid-1990s that made communications on the web safe for online banking. "With encryption, you can actually get many or most of the properties of transparency and privacy and data security at the same time," Wilcox said in July at American Banker's Blockchains + Digital Currencies conference in New York. "You can add encrypted data to a blockchain in such a way that's decryptable to authorized parties but not to the world." Yet it retains important properties of the blockchain — "you can't give different stories to different people and you can't change your story later," Wilcox said. After pausing work on ZSL to make sure the cryptocurrency was released on time and securely, the firm is now tending to both projects simultaneously. "Our code is getting a trial by fire on the wild and woolly Internet," Wilcox said by email Monday. An obvious question is whether the Zcash currency's privacy features will make it more difficult for the financial institutions involved — such as digital currency exchanges and wallet services, or their banking providers — to comply with anti-money-laundering regulations. On the one hand, Zcash's "selective disclosure" capabilities, combined with the pressure on intermediaries to comply with AML rules, would ensure that most transactions are traceable. The work of collecting basic transactional data for AML purposes would likely be performed by third parties like wallets and exchanges. To comply with rules for money-services businesses, or simply by virtue of needing to satisfy their bank partners, these companies would have to obtain data on the parties in each transaction and other information to ensure that they can flag suspicious transactions. "All of that same compliance infrastructure still needs to be in place," said Pratin Vallabhaneni, an associate at the law firm of Arnold & Porter. "If you're a user of Zcash thinking, 'Oh, I'm going to have a more anonymous transaction,'" he added, "that's not correct because you won't be able to enter into the [rest of the financial] ecosystem" without disclosing basic identifying information. « 1  |  2 »     view entire article Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints JOIN THE DISCUSSION Comment SEE MORE IN Law & Regulation RELATED TAGS Bank Technology, Comments (0) Be the first to comment on this post using the section below.

(PRWEB) October 31, 2016 On November 1, 2016, at the Liberty House Restaurant in Jersey City, New Jersey at 6:00 p.m., Rising Tide Capital will honor longtime corporate partner, JPMorgan Chase as a “Champion of Inclusive Economies,” alongside inventor Joy Mangano–whose story was featured in the Oscar-nominated film “Joy,” and The Blackstone Foundation at the 5th annual Start Something Champions Gala. This gala marks the culmination of The Start Something Challenge (SSC), New Jersey’s largest business pitch competition, which JPMorgan Chase has supported since its inception. Over the past 5 years, nearly 400 entrepreneurs from 100 towns and cities across New Jersey have entered the competition, which has invested approximately $125,000 in grants to its winners’ businesses. At the gala, the winners of this year’s SSC will be recognized and receive $25,000 in grants and prizes. “At JPMorgan Chase, we are committed to addressing complex social challenges in the communities where we live and work,” said Richard Fonte, New Jersey Market Manager for Business Banking at JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase’s support of Rising Tide Capital isn’t limited to the Start Something Challenge. They have also funded the organization’s Business Acceleration Services, a suite of business support services that include business coaching, micro and small business loan assistance, and access to a variety of business resources including business incubators, legal services and a network of reliable and vetted small business professionals. Added JPMorgan Chase’s Fonte,” We know that fostering local entrepreneurship is integral to the development of vibrant and economically inclusive communities. That’s why we recently announced our the expansion of our Small Business Forward program, a three-year $75 million initiative to support women, minority, and veteran-owned small businesses around the country. When we support our communities and their businesses, we all win.” “Since 2004, Rising Tide Capital has been doing the work of inclusive entrepreneurship, working to equip talented men and women to build strong businesses that can fundamentally change their communities,” said Alfa Demmellash, CEO and co-founder of Rising Tide Capital. “JPMorgan Chase has been a steadfast partner in this critical work for almost as long as we have existed. They haven’t simply provided funding, they have also provided volunteers who participate at every level of our organization, from our Strategic Advisory Board to our classrooms. This is why we are so proud to honor them as our Champion of Inclusive Economies–they understand that for a healthy economy to exist, every layer of it needs to be strengthened.” The proceeds from the gala will underwrite scholarships for entrepreneurs from urban, underserved communities to participate in Rising Tide Capital’s nationally recognized Community Business Academy, an intensive and targeted 12-week training on how to start, grow, and sustain a business. Within two years of graduating from this program entrepreneurs see a 64% increase in their business sales and a corresponding 47% increase in household income. They also experience a 56% reduction in the use of public assistance resulting from the ongoing support and resources offered by RTC. The 5th Annual Start Something Champions Gala, takes place from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. at the Liberty House Restaurant in Jersey City.

I’m dressing up as a tired reporter sick to death of this dismal, issue-free campaign. … The news that the FBI would review emails found on a laptop shared by top Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her creepy, estranged husband Anthony Weiner walloped the political world. The news hit as Donald Trump was already drawing close to Hillary Clinton in national polls. We’ve always said wild card investigatory disclosures posed the biggest threat to a solid Clinton win. Well, we got one. Will it be enough to swing the election to Trump? Probably not. But taking the focus away from Trump certainly helps the GOP nominee and threatens to undermine Democrats’ chances for a wave that sweeps them to Senate control. Story Continued Below We don’t have enough post-Comey polling to determine the national impact. And Democrats are attempting to make Comey’s unusual decision this close to Election Day the issue. This could fire up some Democratic turnout but it’s a major net negative. Still, Trump’s path to 270 is still really, super hard. He has to win Ohio and Florida, which seems possible. But then he also has to win a bunch of other states where he trails including some combination of Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Colorado, New Hampshire and Nevada. Still a giant lift. And Clinton is competitive in Alaska, Arizona, Georgia and Utah, not what you’d call Democratic strongholds. BRIEF MARKET MOVE — Compass Point’s Isaac Boltansky: “The letter injected uncertainty into the 2016 election and briefly roiled markets with the VIX spiking as much as ~13 percent intra-day. … We continue to believe that the electoral math heavily favors Clinton taking the White House and maintain our ~90 percent odds of her victory. In our view, the most tangible impact of this development will be felt in down-ballot races. “The ‘Democratic Sweep’ narrative already faced long odds and we expect the most recent email development to effectively end Democratic hopes of winning back both chambers of Congress. Odds still slightly favor Democrats taking the Senate, but we believe this email scandal will ensure that the House stays under Republican control.” ASIA STUTTERS EARLY — Reuters: “Asian stocks got off to a shaky start on Monday after a renewed FBI probe of … Clinton … The Japanese yen, seen as a safe-haven in times of uncertainty, rose slightly against the U.S. dollar. … Markets have tended to see Clinton as the candidate of the status quo, while there is greater uncertainty over what a victory for … Trump might mean for U.S. foreign policy, international trade deals or the domestic economy. “The dollar surged 0.7 percent against the Mexican peso on Friday and extended those gains by another 0.2 percent to 18.9982 peso early on Monday. A Trump victory has been viewed as a key risk for the Mexican currency given his promises to clamp down on immigration and redraw trade relations with the country.” Read more. THE DAILY TRUMP — Trump campaigning Sunday night said of Clinton as president : “You could have 650 million people pour in and we do nothing. Think about. That’s what could happen. You triple the size of the country in one week.” Wait. What? TOOMEY WARNS BANKERS OF WARREN WARPATH — POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt: “Sen. Pat Toomey is trying to leverage bankers' fears of Sen. Elizabeth Warren to rally support for his tough reelection fight. In a conference call with a pro-industry group Friday morning, the Pennsylvania Republican said Warren has frightened Democrats from pursuing regulatory changes that would help banks, according to a paraphrased summary of the call obtained by POLITICO. “‘While there are individual Democrats that support traditional banks and reform, there is little to no chance of reform passing if the Democrats take control of the Senate due to Elizabeth Warren's influence on leadership,’ Friends of Traditional Banking Chairman John Boyer wrote in the email describing Toomey's comments.” Read more. ICYMI: GDP WAS PRETTY GOOD — POLITICO’s Ben White (right before the Comey thing blew up the news cycle): “The U.S. economy grew at a nearly 3 percent pace in the third quarter of the year, a better-than-expected reading that dents … Trump’s case that growth has stalled out. The faster pace of 2.9 percent may not hold up in the final quarter of 2016 but it offers a positive headline to … Clinton less than two weeks until Election Day … Republicans, even those still supporting the GOP nominee, view 2016 as a largely lost opportunity to frame the race as a referendum on the economy … “‘At every turn I urged him to talk about the economy and tax cuts, particularly business tax cuts, where there is virtual unanimous agreement to do something,’ said Larry Kudlow, an informal Trump economic adviser. ‘It was a tactical mistake not to and it was a strategic mistake because the economy is poor and the country believes we are on the wrong track and a lot of that is about the economy.’” Read more. GE NEARS $30B DEAL — WSJ’s Dana Cimilluca, Dana Mattioli and David Benoit: “General Electric Co. is nearing a roughly $30 billion deal to combine its oil and gas business with Baker Hughes Inc., creating an energy powerhouse that would give GE a cost-effective way to play any recovery in the industry. GE plans to contribute its oil and gas business and some cash to the new entity, which would have publicly traded shares and be controlled by GE” Read more.

He’s scheduled to be in Wisconsin on Tuesday … Clinton campaigns in Ohio on Monday, Florida on Tuesday and Arizona on Wednesday (all campaign schedules are subject to change this late in the game) … Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is in London and Oxford, England on Monday … FOMC meets Tuesday and Wednesday with no change in policy expected … Personal income and spending Monday at 8:30 a.m. expected to both rise 0.4 percent … ISM Manufacturing at 10:00 a.m. Tuesday expected to rise to 51.7 from 51.5 … ISM non-manufacturing at 10:00 a.m. Thursday expected to dip to 56.0 from 57.1 … October jobs report at 8:30 a.m. Friday expected to show a gain of 165K and 0.1 percent drop in unemployment to 4.9 percent. NO BIG CENTRAL BANK MOVES THIS WEEK — Mohamed A. El-Erian: “The central banks of Japan, the U.K., and the U.S. will hold policy meetings this week. These three systemically important institutions are inclined to implement new policy measures, albeit different ones. Yet all three may end up keeping their policy stance as is. Their individual and collective dilemmas will illustrate the current policy funk facing the global economy, as well as the urgent need for a macroeconomic policy pivot on three continents.” CETA SIGNED — POLITICO EU’s Christian Oliver, David M. Herszenhorn and Anca Gurzu: “The European Union and Canada signed a landmark trade deal Sunday, drawing a line under four months of political conflict across Europe that at times looked likely to scupper the pact. “The deal is now expected to enter force on a provisional basis early next year, as long as it wins support from the European Parliament, which is seen as likely.” Read more. HOPE FOR TTIP? — Reuters’ Robert-Jan Bartunek: “A much-debated trade deal between the European Union and the United States is not dead and negotiations will continue with the new U.S. administration after November's elections, EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said on Saturday. “‘TTIP is not dead, but TTIP is not yet an agreement,’ she told reporters after a ceremony in Brussels, in which Belgium signed its addendum to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) with Canada. ‘The U.S. election will naturally bring the negotiations to a pause and we will resume after with the new administration,’ she added.” Read more. OPEC TALKS FAIL — Bloomberg’s Grant Smith and Elena Mazneva: “OPEC’s internal disagreements over how to implement oil-supply cuts agreed to last month prevented a deal to secure the cooperation of other major suppliers. “More than 18 hours of talks over two days in Vienna yielded little more than a promise that the world’s largest oil producers would keep on talking. Discussions will continue in late November, just days before the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is supposed to finalize the accord that lifted oil prices to one-year highs.” Read more. RUSSIA SLASHES SPENDING — FT’s Kathrin Hille: “Russia is preparing to slash government spending across the board over the next three years as it struggles to bring down a budget deficit swollen by lower oil prices and recession. “The scale of the proposed austerity measures, at a time when Russia’s recession is bottoming out but incomes continue to fall, illustrate how badly the country’s public finances have been hurt by the oil price slide, which has also forced Gulf states to slash spending.” Read more. LONDON RULES FOR UBER DRIVERS — Washington Post’s Karla Adam: “In a landmark ruling Friday that could impact Britain’s wider “gig” economy, a London employment tribunal ruled that taxi drivers using the Uber ride-hailing app are “workers” and entitled to minimum wage and holiday pay. “Uber said Friday it would seek to appeal the judgment, which applies to the two drivers who brought the case to court. But analysts said it could also open the floodgates to claims from other Uber drivers in Britain, as well as the thousands of independent workers in Britain’s gig economy, in which temporary positions are the norm and independent workers perform short-term jobs.” Read more. VENZEULAN SHOWDOWN — FT reports: “Venezuela’s political crisis comes to a head this week in a mass march on the Presidential Palace that raises the risk of a crackdown. “The march, which follows opposition-led mass protests and a general strike last week, is slated to take place even as Vatican-mediated talks between the government and the opposition Democratic Unity coalition (MUD) began on Sunday.” Read more. AMAZON PRIME COMPETES IN CHINA — Bloomberg’s Lulu Yilun Chen: “Amazon.com Inc. has started offering its Prime free-shipping service in China, ratcheting up attempts to compete with Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. for the rising number of shoppers hankering after overseas goods. “From Friday, Chinese Prime subscribers get free shipping on orders exceeding 200 yuan ($29.50) on millions of eligible overseas goods, the company said in an e-mailed statement. Domestic goods will also be delivered free and a membership costs 388 yuan a year, lower than the U.S. fee of $99. Amazon China representative Wu Shanhan said membership won’t include access to any digital content.” Read more. INFLATION’S BACK (A BIT) — WSJ’s Greg Ip: “After being given up for dead, inflation is gradually coming back to life. It’s not roaring back. Indeed, it’s still below the 2 percent level the Federal Reserve targets, one reason the Fed is almost certain to leave interest rates unchanged when it meets this week. But economic circumstances and attitudes of policy makers have shifted in the past year in ways that suggest the likeliest path of inflation is up, not down. “Data released Friday showed that core inflation … reached a two-year high of 1.7 percent in the third quarter … Other data found stirrings of wage acceleration. The intellectual case for low inflation is also showing cracks. Central banks now openly entertain, and even welcome, inflation bubbling over 2 percent. This isn’t bad news. To the contrary, markets and central bankers alike will be relieved that the world is no longer skirting a deflationary abyss” Read more. TRADE SLOWING — NYT’s Binyamin Appelbaum: “The volume of global trade was flat in the first quarter of 2016, then fell by 0.8 percent in the second quarter … The United States is no exception to the broader trend. The total value of American imports and exports fell by more than $200 billion last year. Through the first nine months of 2016, trade fell by an additional $470 billion. It is the first time since World War II that trade with other nations has declined during a period of economic growth.” Read more. CARNEY WANTS TO STAY — FT’s Chris Giles: “Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, is ready to serve a full eight-year term, facing down Brexiter critics campaigning for him to resign ahead of time. Mr Carney has told friends that he is likely to make a statement on his future this week to put an end to damaging speculation. “The governor is expected to confer with prime minister Theresa May and chancellor Philip Hammond before making a final ‘personal’ decision, potentially ahead of the publication of the BoE’s inflation report on Thursday.” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: As traditional pensions have disappeared, American workers have become more responsible for saving and preparing for their retirements. With longer lifespans, this often means saving for a longer retirement. These challenges have made planning and saving for retirement more difficult.

It’s neither, but that doesn’t mean you should ignore its stock. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 31, 2016 at 7:11AM JPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. If you're thinking about buying JPMorgan Chase's (NYSE:JPM) stock, the first question you should ask yourself is whether it's cheap or expensive. Unfortunately, the answer is: neither. But this doesn't mean you should avoid its stock. A wonderful company at a fair price One of Warren Buffett's famous sayings is, "It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price." This fits JPMorgan Chase to a tee. No one who follows bank stocks closely would argue right now that JPMorgan Chase's stock is cheap. To be considered cheap in the context of bank stocks a bank's shares need to trade below book value. This is the case at Bank of America and Citigroup, shares of which are priced at approximately 30% discounts to book value. In other words, investors think these banks are worth roughly a third less than the banks claim to be. JPMorgan Chase, by contrast, trades for an 8% premium to its book value. Compared to Bank of America and Citigroup, it's clear that JPMorgan Chase's stock is far from cheap. Yet, shares of the nation's biggest bank by assets aren't expensive either. Typically speaking, for a bank stock to be considered expensive, it would have to trade for two or more times book value. Few banks trade at such high multiples today, given the hangover from the financial crisis, which has caused short-term interest rates to hover right above 0% for much of the past decade. Because this weighs on the profitability of banks' loan and securities portfolios, it's also reflected in the valuation of their shares. The net result is that JPMorgan Chase's shares are neither cheap nor expensive right now. A healthy dividend But to Buffett's point, this alone shouldn't dissuade investors from buying JPMorgan Chase's stock. By most knowledgeable accounts, the New York-based megabank is an incredibly well-run company. It's efficient, with an efficiency ratio of 59% in the latest quarter. This means that 41% of its revenue is left over after operating expenses are deducted to cover loan losses, income taxes, and then to distribute to shareholders. Most other banks, by contrast, have efficiency ratios in excess of 60%. JPMorgan Chase is also in a commanding position on Main Street, through its robust commercial banking operations, and on Wall Street, by way of its investment bank. This gives it a diversity of revenue streams that can help offset fluctuations in the business cycle, making it a more stable holding for risk-averse investors. Finally, JPMorgan Chase pays a generous and growing dividend. Its stock currently yields 2.8%. That ranks it sixth on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks shares of two dozen blue-chip bank stocks. And it means that owners of JPMorgan Chase's shares earn considerably more in dividend payments than owners of the typical stock on the S&P 500, which yields 2.1%. JPM Dividend data by YCharts. While JPMorgan Chase certainly isn't a screaming bargain, I believe it's reasonably priced and offers considerable room for growth once interest rates begin to rise in earnest.

Last Thursday, the maker of touch screens used in mobile devices and other products reported margins that fell short of analysts' expectations, causing the shares to plunge. "The margin swoon is on higher-than-expected revenues, so the gross profit and consensus EPS [earnings per share] outlook remain largely unchanged, and the company outlook calls for margins to improve in early CY17 [calendar year 2017]," wrote equity analyst Paul Coster in a research note.

Less than a month after the IPO, Wall Street finally tells you what it thinks about this stock. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Nov 1, 2016 at 12:23PM Today we're going to tell you about a stock -- one that you may not have heard of before, but one that a few analysts think you should like. Camping World Holdings (NYSE:CWH) is the stock's name, and recreational vehicles (RVs) are its game. This morning, no fewer than six Wall Street analysts announced new ratings for Camping World Holdings, splitting their ratings down the middle with three buy ratings and three holds. R.W. Baird, KeyBanc, and Credit Suisse all hail from the buy camp, while Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs counsel holding the stock for now. And here's something that may surprise you: Each and every one of these bankers also helped to run Camping World Holdings' IPO last month! Now, wouldn't you like to know what they really think about the stock? Then you're in luck. Read on, and find out. Camping World loves the RV lifestyle -- but does Wall Street still love the stock? Image source: Camping World IPO prospectus. Let loose the bulls We'll let the bulls go first in this debate. Underwriting more than 688,000 Camping World shares, Credit Suisse tied as the stock's third-largest backer during last month's IPO. It's not too surprising, therefore, that Credit Suisse really likes this stock. Quoted on StreetInsider.com this morning, Credit Suisse rates Camping World stock an "outperform," and argues the company operates in a "fragmented industry," and offers "potential upside from higher EPS and multiple expansion." A seller of new and used RVs, Camping World also does good business selling insurance and other services to RV owners, a business model that Credit Suisse likes for its "recurring revenue model." With its "low valuation" of just $412 million in market capitalization, and trailing net profits of $190 million, Credit Suisse sees Camping World as "one of the most attractive stories in the consumer space." The analyst predicts Camping World, currently priced at $22 and change, will hit $28 within a year. For their parts, KeyBanc and R.W. Baird played lesser roles in the IPO -- but they're no less enthusiastic about the stock. According to data from ratings monitor TheFly.com, KeyBanc rates Camping World overweight with a $28 price target, while Baird says the stock will "outperform" and head to $27 a share. Having second thoughts What may interest investors even more than Camping World's enthusiasts, though, is the names of some of the analysts who once actively pushed investors to buy the stock, but whose own enthusiasm has now cooled. Chief among these are Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. Each banker underwrote nearly 4.1 million shares of Camping World stock, and so presumably liked the stock four weeks ago. But both of these bankers now rate the stock no better than neutral. Up only pennies from its Oct. 7 IPO price of $22, Goldman says that Camping World stock is worth at best $24 today. TheFly quotes Goldman warning investors that "decelerating" RV shipments industrywide "will likely weigh on the stock's multiple." JPMorgan gives Camping World only slightly more credit, assigning a $25 price target to Camping World stock. Similarly, Wells Fargo rates the stock a "market perform," and says the stock is fairly valued anywhere in the range from $23 to $25 a share -- the lower price being only pennies more than what Camping World costs today, and just $1 above the price at which Wells was pushing the stock at its IPO! A Foolish view With Wall Street walking back its enthusiasm so soon after the IPO, investors may feel somewhat less than certain about Camping World's prospects today. So what's an investor to do -- panic and sell, or stick with the stock? Here's how I look at the situation. Currently, Camping World stock sells for a P/E ratio of just 2.2. That may sound absurdly low, and imply that Camping World's recent profits are a fluke. In fact, though, Camping World's earnings don't look like a huge aberration to me. The company earned $190 million in net profits over the past 12 months, true. But it earned not much less ($178 million) in 2015 as a whole, and $125 million the year before that. Even valuing the stock on its earnings from two years ago, therefore, I can't call Camping World obviously overvalued at a mere 3.3 times 2014 earnings. Meanwhile, analysts who have published estimates for the stock on S&P Global Market Intelligence agree Camping World is likely to grow its earnings at a modest 8% pace annually over the next five years. That doesn't seem like a lot to pay for a stock selling for 2.2 times earnings -- or even 3.3. Granted, Camping World stock carries a heaping helping of debt -- $1.3 billion net of cash. Granted too, its cash flow statement is not without blemishes. (Free cash flow for the past 12 months, for example, amounts to only $97.5 million -- barely half of reported net income.) Weighing all these factors into consideration, there is reason for caution about the stock. But even so, I don't see any need to panic and sell just yet.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 31, 2016 at 2:21PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. October was a good month for Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) investors. Shares of the nation's second-biggest bank by assets rose 6.6% through the month, outperforming its closest competitors JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo. BAC data by YCharts. Two things explain Bank of America's performance in October. 1. Continued rebound Shares of the bank were primed to continue rebounding after dropping steeply to begin the year. Its stock bottomed out in February, at just about the same time that oil prices dipped below $30 a barrel. This wasn't a coincidence, as the low prices made it difficult for energy companies to service their bank loans. This led Bank of America to increase the amount of money it set aside in the first quarter in anticipation of future loan losses. It was around the same time that the United Kingdom announced that it would hold a referendum in June to decide whether to remain as a member in the European Union. This triggered uncertainty in the markets, which resulted in a 16% drop in Bank of America's first-quarter trading revenues. Bank stocks fell again in June in the wake of the vote, which came out in support of leaving. By the time third-quarter earnings rolled around last month, Bank of America's investors were looking for any reason to conclude that its otherwise dismal performance for the year would improve. And that's exactly what they got. 2. Better-than-expected earnings As I discuss here, almost all of Bank of America's headline metrics went in the right direction in the three months ended Sept. 30. Revenue was up 3% on a year-over-year basis, thanks to higher interest and noninterest income. Expenses at the $2.2 trillion bank were down. And its net income came in 7% above the same quarter in 2015. Investors responded by sending Bank of America's shares higher, as they did with most other bank stocks. Since reporting earnings on Oct. 17, the North Carolina-based bank's share price has climbed 4.3%. The good news for enterprising investors is that there's still a lot of fuel in the proverbial tank when it comes to Bank of America's shares, as they continue to trade for a 31% discount to book value, making the stock the second-cheapest blue chip bank stock after Citigroup. The true game changer will be higher interest rates, which could very well be in the works for later this year, if JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is right. According to Bank of America's third-quarter earnings presentation, a 100-basis-point increase in short- and long-term rates will translate into $5.3 billion more net interest income over the next 12 months. That would go a long way when you consider that Bank of America earns less than $5 billion a quarter -- its earnings last quarter were $4.96 billion. This would also consolidate the improvement in Bank of America's profitability, which has stabilized at 10.3% of its tangible common equity, suggesting that the bank is on the precipice of generating value for shareholders after taking into account the opportunity cost of owning its shares. It remains to be seen whether Bank of America can continue its momentum through the end of the year, but either way, it's headed in the right direction. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Foreign investors’ purchases of Chinese bonds will probably surge more than fourfold in the coming two years as global central banks diversify their reserves. Monetary authorities and supranational organizations will lead buying of about $48 billion each in 2017 and 2018, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 11 analysts. That’s more than four times the $12 billion of the whole of last year. Inflows have slowed to $8 billion so far in 2016 as the yuan’s 4.2 percent decline sapped investor confidence. “There’s still huge potential for reserve managers to slowly diversify their reserves into the yuan,” said Paul Mackel, head of emerging-markets currency research at HSBC Holdings Plc. “The appetite from real money managers, such as pension funds and mutual funds, is again very, very high. If China is eventually included in major bond indexes, it could bring an average $80 billion-$100 billion annually over the coming years.” While China opened up its bond markets in preparation for the yuan’s entry into the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights on Oct. 1, capital inflows have seen a limited impact. The scenario will change over time, with the Chinese currency accounting for as much as 10 percent of the world’s $11 trillion of foreign-exchange reserves in a decade’s time, according to Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University professor and former head of the IMF’s China division. Nine of the Bloomberg News survey’s 11 respondents put more than even odds of Chinese government debt being added to major bond indexes by the end of 2018. Inclusion would help bring $750 billion of inflows in the next 10 years, according to the median estimate in the poll. PBOC Deputy Governor Pan Gongsheng said earlier this year that China will push for the inclusion of domestic notes in global measures such as those compiled by Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Citigroup said that it is seeking client feedback that can be used in any potential review, while JPMorgan said it has placed Chinese onshore government bonds on review to be included in its emerging-market indexes. Chinese sovereign bonds have handed investors a profit in all but one of the past 11 quarters amid an asset famine, with a total return of 25 percent in the period. The mainland’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index of stocks is down 12 percent for the year, the government is moving to curb rising property prices, while channels for moving money abroad have been choked as policy makers look to discourage the flight of capital. SDR-driven inflows are already showing signs of picking up, with foreign investors’ holdings of Chinese onshore sovereign debt rising a record $6 billion in September, according to data from China Central Depository & Clearing Co. Many have been drawn by the nation’s higher yields: China’s benchmark 10-year sovereign debt yields 2.70 percent, compared with 1.72 percent in South Korea, 1.85 percent in the U.S. and close to zero in Germany. The offshore yuan was trading at 6.7834 a dollar late Monday. “The IMF’s acknowledgment of the yuan as a freely usable currency enables central banks to count yuan assets as part of their official reserves, rather than just foreign-currency assets,” said Becky Liu, senior greater China rates strategist at Standard Chartered Plc. “The nature of reserves investment is to get exposure to reserve currencies, instead of hedging everything back to the dollar.” On the Way Private players are on the way too. Pacific Investment Management Co. will probably be onshore in China in a year or two, Asia Pacific head Eric Mogelof said at the Bloomberg Markets Most Influential Summit in Hong Kong on Sept. 28. Earlier this year, Bridgewater Associates became the first foreign hedge fund manager to win approval to set up a wholly owned investment-management business in China, according to Shanghai-based consulting firm Z-Ben Advisors. A Deutsche Bank survey indicated that the aggregate share of Asian local currency bond portfolios allocated to onshore yuan bonds will rise from roughly 5 percent now to almost 13 percent a year later, and over 26 percent in five years’ time. Still, a lack of liquid hedging instruments is most frequently cited as a factor limiting investments, according to the poll. China’s efforts to open its $8 trillion onshore bond market have been hampered by secondary trading that’s far less than levels seen in the U.S. While the market is the world’s third-largest, annual trading as a ratio of total outstanding debt is 1.9, compared with 4.7 in the U.S., Bloomberg calculations based on official data show. “There is certainly a lot of work to do, including improving market infrastructure, liquidity and ratings, but the obstacles should be able to be removed soon,” said Wu Qiong, a Hong Kong-based analyst at BOC International Holdings Ltd. “Once China is included in global indexes, it’s likely to see very impressive growth of holdings by foreign fund managers.”   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.

After all, jobs are back, the Federal Reserve is close to raising interest rates again and growth has perked up after a sluggish first half. But instead of ramping up lending to keep up with deposits, banks are plowing into U.S. government and related debt at the fastest clip since 2014. The easy answer, of course, has to do with post-crisis financial regulations, which were designed to curb risk-taking and have compelled banks to hold more high-quality assets. Yet in many ways, the buildup reflects a more worrying sign. In the past year, more loan officers at large and midsize banks have tightened credit to businesses than at any time since 2009, when the U.S. was still reeling from the housing bust. Americans are also saving more rather than taking on extra debt, damping demand for new loans. Though it’s hard to say whether that means the seven-year-long U.S. expansion may be closer to an end than the upbeat data suggest, the demand for bonds is welcome news for investors buffeted by the biggest monthly selloff since 2010. “Banks continue to buy Treasuries as we move further through the economic cycle,” said Jeff Caughron, chief operating officer at Oklahoma City-based Baker Group, which advises community banks with over $45 billion in investments. And there are just “fewer good loans out there to be made.” That may help contain the backup in Treasury yields as rates rise and foreign demand slows. Global Selloff Yields on the U.S. 10-year note have climbed about a half-percentage point since falling to an all-time low of 1.318 percent in July. They were about 1.84 percent today. Losses have accelerated as bonds globally head for their worst month in about six years on speculation major central banks are moving closer to reining in stimulus. But with banks finding fewer opportunities to lend, it’s raising deeper questions about the prospects for future economic growth. Commercial banks in the U.S. have amassed $90 billion of Treasuries and non-mortgage debt from federal agencies this year alone, bringing the total to $754 billion, according to data compiled by the Fed. Including federally guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, banks now own $2.4 trillion of government bonds, which would be the most since the central bank began compiling data in 1973. The five biggest lenders -- Wells Fargo & Co., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and U.S. Bancorp -- held a combined $206 billion of government debt at the end of the second quarter, according to the latest available filings. That’s a 74 percent increase over the past three years. Banks aren’t lending more because the economy “isn’t growing as fast as we’d like it to grow,” said Paul Miller, a bank analyst at FBR Capital Markets & Co. “Banks are only able to take a certain amount of risk.” Bank of America, the only big lender to provide supplemental data on its investments through September, has doubled its “available-for-sale” holdings in government debt to $45 billion over the past six months. AFS excludes securities used in daily trading and those intended to be held until maturity. Citigroup has also increased its exposure in a big way, boosting its holdings to $126 billion at the end of June, the most since at least 1999. What’s more, banking organizations across America have boosted the stakes they plan to hold to maturity (meaning they can keep those investments on their books at the price they paid and not worry about market fluctuations) to almost a half-trillion dollars in the second quarter, based on New York Fed data. At the end of 2013, the figure was just $50 billion. A big reason banks are funneling so much money into safe assets is that deposit growth is outstripping loan demand. For the biggest lenders, deposits increased by 6.7 percent to $5.2 trillion in the third quarter from a year earlier, exceeding loan growth by a full percentage point. Few Alternatives “We have more deposits coming in than we have loans,” Brian Moynihan, Bank of America’s chief executive officer, said on its Oct. 17 third-quarter earnings call. “We don’t take credit risk there, and so we have two alternatives, Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities.” Over the past year, the rate of Bank of America’s commercial-loan growth has fallen from more than 10 percent to less than 5 percent. At the same time, consumer lending remains stagnant, contracting for a 23rd consecutive quarter. Citigroup’s retail loan business has also shrunk, while JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, two of the strongest banking franchises in the U.S., have seen gains in their overall lending slow in recent quarters as well. Instead of leaving idle cash parked at the Fed, where its earns only 0.5 percent, U.S. government bonds are providing banks an increasingly attractive spread over what they pay depositors. Two-year Treasury notes yield 0.85 percent, while the average deposit rate for interest-bearing checking accounts is 0.31 percent, according to Bankrate.com. Interest Margins For JPMorgan, the gap between yields on two-year U.S. notes and the bank’s average deposit rate has been roughly 0.64 percentage point this year, the widest in a decade, data compiled by Bloomberg show. “Banks need yield wherever they can so this is an interest-margin story also,” said George Goncalves, the head of U.S. rates research at Nomura Holdings Inc. Banks have also become more reluctant to take on too many risks and expose themselves to potential loan losses, especially as growth remains lackluster and borrowers seek to reduce their indebtedness. According to the Fed’s quarterly senior loan officer survey, a majority of large and medium-sized U.S. lenders have tightened lending standards for four straight quarters. That hasn’t happened since 2009, when the U.S. was still struggling to emerge from the worst economic crisis in seven decades. Even banks that are faring better have grown more cautious. “We are being very selective in what loans we make and who we make one to,” said Thomas Wornham, CEO and president of San Diego Private Bancorp of America, which extended loans at almost twice the rate of its deposit growth last quarter. “What you are seeing out there is a slowdown.” Both Ways To some, that’s just how banks should behave, since excessive risk-taking was exactly what led to the financial crisis. “It’s one of those paradoxes,” said David Keeble, the head of fixed-income strategy at Credit Agricole SA. “The Fed probably wants it both ways -- they want more lending to keep the economy going, but more safe lending, which means less lending.” Whatever the case, it’s clear that while the excess liquidity from the Fed’s easy-money policies has been a boon for government securities, banks are still wary of putting much of the cash to work. “Banks have lots of customer deposits and corporations aren’t spending cash,” said Moorad Choudhry, a professor in the business school at University of Kent and the author of more than a dozen books on finance including “The Principles of Banking.” “There is nowhere else for banks to put this money.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Monetary authorities and supranational organizations will lead buying of about US$48 billion (RM201.7 billion) each in 2017 and 2018, according to a Bloomberg News survey of 11 analysts. That’s more than four times the US$12 billion of the whole of last year. Inflows have slowed to US$8 billion so far in 2016 as the yuan’s 4.2 per cent decline sapped investor confidence. “There’s still huge potential for reserve managers to slowly diversify their reserves into the yuan,” said Paul Mackel, head of emerging-markets currency research at HSBC Holdings Plc. “The appetite from real money managers, such as pension funds and mutual funds, is again very, very high. If China is eventually included in major bond indexes, it could bring an average US$80 billion-US$100 billion annually over the coming years.” While China opened up its bond markets in preparation for the yuan’s entry into the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Rights on Oct. 1, capital inflows have seen a limited impact. The scenario will change over time, with the Chinese currency accounting for as much as 10 per cent of the world’s US$11 trillion of foreign-exchange reserves in a decade’s time, according to Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University professor and former head of the IMF’s China division. Nine of the Bloomberg News survey’s 11 respondents put more than even odds of Chinese government debt being added to major bond indexes by the end of 2018. Inclusion would help bring US$750 billion of inflows in the next 10 years, according to the median estimate in the poll. PBOC Deputy Governor Pan Gongsheng said earlier this year that China will push for the inclusion of domestic notes in global measures such as those compiled by Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co Citigroup said that it is seeking client feedback that can be used in any potential review, while JPMorgan said it has placed Chinese onshore government bonds on review to be included in its emerging-market indexes. Chinese sovereign bonds have handed investors a profit in all but one of the past 11 quarters amid an asset famine, with a total return of 25 per cent in the period. The mainland’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index of stocks is down 12 per cent for the year, the government is moving to curb rising property prices, while channels for moving money abroad have been choked as policy makers look to discourage the flight of capital. SDR-driven inflows are already showing signs of picking up, with foreign investors’ holdings of Chinese onshore sovereign debt rising a record US$6 billion in September, according to data from China Central Depository & Clearing Co. Many have been drawn by the nation’s higher yields: China’s benchmark 10-year sovereign debt yields 2.70 per cent, compared with 1.72 per cent in South Korea, 1.85 per cent in the US and close to zero in Germany. The offshore yuan was trading at 6.7859 a dollar early today. “The IMF’s acknowledgment of the yuan as a freely usable currency enables central banks to count yuan assets as part of their official reserves, rather than just foreign-currency assets,” said Becky Liu, senior greater China rates strategist at Standard Chartered Plc. “The nature of reserves investment is to get exposure to reserve currencies, instead of hedging everything back to the dollar.” On the way Private players are on the way too. Pacific Investment Management Co will probably be onshore in China in a year or two, Asia Pacific head Eric Mogelof said at the Bloomberg Markets Most Influential Summit in Hong Kong on Sept. 28. Earlier this year, Bridgewater Associates became the first foreign hedge fund manager to win approval to set up a wholly owned investment-management business in China, according to Shanghai-based consulting firm Z-Ben Advisors. A Deutsche Bank survey indicated that the aggregate share of Asian local currency bond portfolios allocated to onshore yuan bonds will rise from roughly 5 per cent now to almost 13 per cent a year later, and over 26 per cent in five years’ time. Still, a lack of liquid hedging instruments is most frequently cited as a factor limiting investments, according to the poll. China’s efforts to open its US$8 trillion onshore bond market have been hampered by secondary trading that’s far less than levels seen in the US While the market is the world’s third-largest, annual trading as a ratio of total outstanding debt is 1.9, compared with 4.7 in the US, Bloomberg calculations based on official data show. “There is certainly a lot of work to do, including improving market infrastructure, liquidity and ratings, but the obstacles should be able to be removed soon,” said Wu Qiong, a Hong Kong-based analyst at BOC International Holdings Ltd. “Once China is included in global indexes, it’s likely to see very impressive growth of holdings by foreign fund managers. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Nepal PM phones India’s Modi over rupee chaos Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites European equities drift higher United to delay taking Boeing jets in US$4.8b savings push Snapchat files for one of the biggest tech IPOs in years, sources say Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter Most Watched Now Week An in-depth look at Mazda’s SKYACTIV-G engine Reuters Video: Groin-flashing frog discovered in Australia Reuters Video: Supermoon dazzles in Havana Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Related Articles Chinese bonds headed for longest run of losses in three years The challenges facing China’s bond market (VIDEO) Chinese stocks halt four-day winning streaks as financials slump Guotai: Bull run on China’s bond market may last for record 10 quarters China seen hogging Asia bond fund pie as yuan’s entry to IMF basket to lure flows Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

The 13th District covers most of rural southern Chester County as well as the borough of Christiana in Lancaster County. The municipalities in Chester County include East Nottingham, Elk, Franklin, Highland, London Grove, Londonderry, Lower Oxford, New London, Penn, Upper Oxford, West Fallowfield, West Nottingham, Atglen, Oxford and West Grove. Lawrence was elected to his seat in 2011 after state Rep. Art Hershey announced his retirement. Dean has not run for state office previously. John Lawrence Lawrence, 38, is a lifelong resident of southern Chester County. After graduating from Penn State with a degree in business, he accepted a position at JPMorgan Chase in Newark, eventually becoming a vice president in the Private Client Group. He and his wife have been married for 15 years, and have two daughters. “During my time in office, I have advocated for fiscal responsibility and reform; leading by example I have declined the state pension and many of the other ‘perks’ that legislators of the past voted themselves,” he said. Advertisement On the issue of schools, Lawrence said parents should have good choices and a strong voice in the education of their children. He said he has been an advocate for public, public charter, and private schools. “With regard to the Keystone Exams, I do not support a mandate requiring a student to pass the Keystones in order to graduate — this mandate unfairly punishes students who are leaning toward a career in skilled trades. I am a strong supporter of the EITC tax credit, which provides additional funding for both public and private schools,” he said. In matters of the state budget and finances, Lawrence says that the biggest financial issue facing Pennsylvania is the $60 billion unfunded liability in the state teacher’s and worker’s pension systems. He said the “liability is not the fault of the teachers,” but rather the “result of incredibly poor decisions made by both Republican and Democrat elected officials in the early 2000s.” Lawrence said he is “a supporter of eliminating property taxes and moving toward a sales and income tax based model to fund education.” On reproductive issues, Lawrence said, “I recognize and respect that people can strongly disagree on the issue of abortion. With this in mind, I have been, and will continue to be, a voice for life in the Legislature.” Lawrence said he is a supporter of farmland preservation. Lawrence said he supports the right of Pennsylvanians to carry guns. “I take my oath to uphold the constitution very seriously. The Legislature has taken important steps, which I have supported, to keep guns out of the hands of those likely to offend. Some of these measures include adding more mental health records to the federal background check database, and significantly increasing penalties on straw purchasers of guns. These are concrete steps that have a measurable impact on gun violence. I am not supportive of legislation that infringes on the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens.” Inasmuch as Chester County has a lot of immigrant labor picking crops, Lawrence said this: “The courts have repeatedly ruled that immigration is a federal issue. Presidents Bush and Obama both had the opportunity, but neither did anything to address this issue. In my view, this vacuum of federal leadership, in conjunction with the aforementioned court rulings, have left the states in a difficult position. On a state level, I have supported initiatives requiring the use of E-Verify for employment purposes, and requiring proof of citizenship to obtain welfare benefits.” Nancy Dean Dean, 67, of Chatham, moved from Delaware to this rural area nine years ago. She pursued a career in teaching, and then made a mid-life career change to ministry. She is now retired. She is married, a mother of two and grandmother of two. “I taught in various settings including several years at a university as I worked on my masters and doctorate in English literature, but made a mid-life turn to study religion at the Divinity School of Harvard University,” she said. “I was ordained in ministry in 1994, and served two churches in Massachusetts, and one in Delaware for 20 years.” Dean said she believes no nation can be healthy and productive without good schools. “While tests have a needed place in evaluation, unfortunately they have steadily become the end rather than the means, and the state is spending far too much on testing when many schools are inadequately supplied to meet the stated goals of the Common Core. Charters can provide a valuable alternative, but they should not weaken the main system, and should be a part of that system for proper oversight and accountability,” she said. Dean believes the state budget must be examined for waste and reductions made that do not unfairly place a burden on public servants who worked in good faith. “Excessive dependence on property taxes is not supported by citizens, so some combination of non-regressive taxes would be better. People should not have their labor undervalued, and there should be a raise in the minimum wage,” she said. She said she supports Planned Parenthood. “Women’s health issues are important, and Planned Parenthood has an excellent history of providing affordable gynecological exams, and help with family planning.” She believes that putting land in trust is a winning plan for protecting the rural landscape. “We live in one of the most beautiful places on earth, and protecting it should a high priority,” she said. Dean believes in the right to own weapons. “I grew up in a family of hunters, also am a gun owner, and know that sensible weapons regulation is good for everyone.” In view of the high number of immigrants employed in Chester County, especially in agriculture, she said, “We are long overdue for an updated, commonsense immigration policy that would help people who want to come for work, but would probably be happy to go home. As it is, the current system encourages often dangerous efforts to come here, and less willingness to return home. For those who would like to be citizens, there should be a way for them to move toward citizenship that is fair and upholds the law.” Subscribe to Home Delivery for only $2.50 per week!

The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Tuesday said its index of national factory activity rose 0.4 percentage point to a reading of 51.9 percent last month. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy.Manufacturing has suffered a prolonged slump in the aftermath of the dollar's surge between June 2014 and December 2015, which has constrained exports. Activity has also been hurt by the collapse in oil drilling after oil prices plunged."The latest data suggest that the manufacturing sector is starting to pick up some momentum following a weak run through most of the year so far," said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. "The sector is due for some improvement as some of the earlier drags that impacted the sector fade." The ISM production sub-index gained 1.8 percentage points to 54.6. But a gauge of new orders slipped to a reading of 52.1 from 55.1 in September, suggesting any future gains in manufacturing activity would be modest. A measure of factory employment jumped 3.2 percentage points to a reading of 52.9.The data came as Federal Reserve officials gathered for a two-day meeting to deliberate on monetary policy. The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise rates at the end of the meeting on Wednesday, which comes less than a week before the Nov. 8 presidential election, but is expected to do so in December.Another report from data firm Markit also suggested an improvement in factory conditions in October. U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data amid jitters over the outcome of the acrimonious election. The dollar was trading lower against a basket of currencies. U.S. stocks and Treasuries were also lower.MILD GAINS Weak manufacturing has contributed to business spending on equipment declining for four straight quarters. While there are signs that a turnaround may be imminent, any improvement in the factory sector will likely be mild. Heavy machinery maker Caterpillar last week reported a 49 percent drop in third-quarter profit from a year ago and lowered its full-year revenue outlook for the second time this year. Caterpillar said demand for new heavy machinery had been undercut by an "abundance" of used construction equipment, a "substantial" number of idle locomotives and a "significant" number of idle mining trucks.Though the dollar's rally appears to have largely faded, the greenback has so far this year gained 0.7 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners."It still seems somewhat premature to get comfortable with the outlook for the sector, given a strong dollar and weak global growth," said Kevin Cummins, senior economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut. Last month, 10 manufacturing industries, including nonmetallic mineral products, furniture, and computer and electronic products reported growth. The eight industries reporting contraction in October included wood products, apparel, primary metals and electrical equipment, and appliances and components.Manufacturers in the primary metals sector said they expected a "considerable" slowdown in October and November, noting that production was down 20 percent. Machinery manufacturers reported that business was up "significantly" because of a hurricane and other storms.In a third report on Tuesday, the Commerce Department said construction spending slipped 0.4 percent in September as outlays on nonresidential structures recorded their biggest drop since December 2015. There were also declines in spending on public construction projects, which fell to its lowest level since March 2014. Outlays on state and local government construction projectsdropped for a third straight month. "The disappointing reading makes us less optimistic for the fourth quarter," said Andrew Hollenhorst, an economist at Citigroup in New York.

By JosephAdinolfi Markets reporter Bank of America’s global currency and commodity analysts now call for the battered British pound to bottom out at $1.15 during the first quarter of next year — one of the more bearish forecasts among major currency dealers. From there, the bank BAC, +0.40% which is the world’s fifth-largest currency dealer according to the 2016 Euromoney rankings, expects the pound to begin a slow recovery as uncertainty surrounding the U.K.’s departure from the European Union recedes. BAML sees the currency reclaiming $1.25 by the end of 2017. The pound GBPUSD, +0.0241%  traded at $1.2300 on Wednesday. Relative to what other banks are saying, the call is aggressively bearish. Currency strategists at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.19%  believe the pound has already bottomed. They see the currency strengthening to $1.23 by the end of the first quarter of 2017 before rising to $1.29 by year’s end. Goldman Sachs Group GS, +0.96%  said it’s possible that the currency could see a 25% drop in a period of less than a year. The pound is already down 17% against the dollar so far this year, so another 8% drop would leave it around $1.12. U.K. economic data has remained relatively robust despite repeated warnings that the economy will suffer in the wake of the Brexit vote. But whatever happens with the data ultimately won’t matter, BAML says, as news surrounding the invocation of Article 50 — a decision that would begin formal negotiations over the terms of the U.K.’s exit from the trade bloc — takes center stage. “The rolling correlation between [the pound] and U.K. macro-data surprises remains in negative territory: markets don't believe that the recent strength in U.K. data will be sustained, nor that it will lead to an immediate change in the Bank of England’s reaction function,” the analysts said. BAML expects the Bank of England to cut its benchmark interest rate by 15 basis points, which would leave it at a record-low 0.1%, a move that would likely weigh on the pound. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May said last month that the U.K. would invoke Article 50 by the end of the first quarter of 2017. May also hinted at her priorities, saying she wants U.K. companies to have “the maximum freedom” to operate in Europe’s single market but not if that means relinquishing control over immigration. Market strategists have repeatedly cut their forecasts for the pound since the June 23 Brexit vote, with some speculating that the currency could eventually reach a history-making parity with the dollar. The currency had already been under pressure since that vote. And on Oct. 6, the pound suddenly plunged more than 6% seemingly without provocation, touching lows of $1.1378 on some trading platforms before staging a quick recovery.

After the revelation last week that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is reopening its inquiry into Hillary Clinton’s use of private e-mail, implied volatility in two-week options in the dollar-yen exchange rate timed to the November 8 vote climbed to the highest levels since September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The foreign-exchange market had been looking past the campaign, putting greater emphasis on global central-bank meetings in December, when the Federal Reserve is forecast to raise interest rates. Sentiment in the currency market shifted after the FBI’s October 28 announcement shattered a period of relative calm. Investors had been betting a likely Clinton victory would prompt the US to uphold global trade agreements denounced by rival Donald Trump, who has also called for tighter immigration controls. C Clinton’s odds of victory have fallen to 75.6 per cent, according to poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight, from 81.6 per cent last week, while traders on online betting market PredictIt give Clinton an 71 per cent chance of winning the election, compared with 81 per cent on October 19. “There will be some volatility before the election and the market may get a bit nervous, especially if it’s a very close one,” said Ugo Lancioni, a money manager in London at Neuberger Berman Group LLC, which oversees about $250 billion. “The market still believes Clinton is going to win, but that may change.” The increased likelihood of a Trump win helps to explain why the JPMorgan Chase & Co. global currency volatility index rose Monday by the most in two weeks, after falling to the lowest level this year on a closing basis on October 24. Implied volatility on two-week options on the dollar-yen pair was 11.6 perc ent, up from 8.9 per cent last week. That on two-month options timed to the December central-bank meetings is 11 per cent, below the 2016 average of 11.7 per cent. US Election Brief: Clinton battles both Trump and FBI as polls narrow Investors speculate a win by Democratic nominee Clinton would mean support for Asian and European trade deals and the independence of the Fed, while a win for her rival may mean a material shift in policies. Republican nominee Trump included several trade elements in his list of actions that he would take during the first 100 days of his presidency, including a plan to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and directing his Secretary of the Treasury to label China, the biggest foreign holder of US Treasuries, a currency manipulator. Implied volatility for the currency pair most closely tracking the election outcome is also taking a similar view. Expected swings for two-week options on the dollar-Mexican peso pair climbed to about 28 per cent around the US elections, according to Bloomberg data, from 12.5 per cent last week. Investors “don’t want to get into the election and have a Brexit happen,” said Andres Jaime, a foreign-exchange strategist in New York at Barclays Plc, referring to the UK vote in June to leave the European Union. “That’s why the market is being a bit more cautious.” Others are downplaying the election risk and are focused on central-bank meetings at year-end. Implied volatility on two-month options on the euro-dollar, the world’s most-traded currency pair, is 8.3 per cent, up from a low in August of 7.1 per cent. “The markets are downplaying the possibility of a US election victory for Trump and are looking toward the Fed announcement” in December, said Samir Sheldenkar, an investment partner in London at Harmonic Capital Partners, with US$1.8 billion under management. Futures show a 71 per cent chance the US central bank will raise rates by year-end, up from 59 per cent a month ago, based on the assumption the effective fed funds rate will trade at the middle of the new Federal Open Market Committee target range after the next increase. The anticipation pushed a gauge of the dollar to the highest levels since March last week. With just a week to go before the White House vote, traders will remain on edge as they re-calibrate expectations for a Clinton win and brace for any additional surprises. “Uncertainty is increasing because the odds are tightening,” said Van Luu, head of currency and fixed-income strategy in London at Russell Investments, which has $244 billion under management. “A Trump victory has the potential to cause exchange rates to break out of the range. In the case of a Clinton victory, the focus will shift back to central-bank policy.”   Most Popular Viewed 1 Decision on Hong Kong localist duo should be made by Legco, not court, lawyers argue in high-stakes hearing over oath saga 2 Beijing ‘strongly dissatisfied’ after South Korean coastguard fires machine guns at Chinese trawlers 3 Beijing interpretation on Legislative Council oath taking rattles Hong Kong 4 WikiLeaks' Assange vows to release ‘significant’ documents before US election 5 Hong Kong’s Legco descends into chaos as Beijing intervention looms Shared 1 Beijing ‘strongly dissatisfied’ after South Korean coastguard fires machine guns at Chinese trawlers 2 Decision on Hong Kong localist duo should be made by Legco, not court, lawyers argue in high-stakes hearing over oath saga 3 Finance, wealth and ... slavery?

Ogg November 1, 2016 10:40 am EST Print Email Tweet Camping World Holdings Inc. (NYSE: CWH) has closed its initial public offering (IPO) and its quiet period has come to an end. This allows the analysts in the underwriting syndicate firms to initiate formal investment coverage for their clients. Investors will want to know that Camping World’s IPO was for 11,363,636 shares of its Class A common stock. All shares were sold by the company, and the offering was at $22.00 per share. 24/7 Wall St. wanted to see how the analyst coverage looked coming out of that quiet period. Details on the IPO itself were given around the time it came public, and not much has changed on the surface since that date. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan were the joint lead book-running managers for this IPO. Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse also acted as joint book-running managers, while Robert W. Baird, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Wells Fargo Securities and Stephens were listed as co-managers. There has been a very mixed bag of analyst initiations seen for this stock, and that is likely acting to cap post-quiet period enthusiasm. We have so far seen three neutral ratings as follows: Goldman Sachs started it as Neutral with a $24 price target. JPMorgan started it as Neutral with a $25 target price. Wells Fargo started it as Market Perform. Below are the coverage calls with Buy, Outperform and Overweight ratings: Merrill Lynch started it as Buy with a $25 price objective. Robert W. Baird started it as Outperform with a $27 target price. Credit Suisse started it as Outperform with a $28 target price. Keybanc Capital Markets started it with an Overweight rating and $28 target price. As a reminder, Camping World is the big retail effort geared toward RV and similar outdoor living that is backed by Marcus Lemonis. Camping World has multiple classes of stock, but we gave a full business summary around the time of its IPO. At last look, Camping World shares were down just 0.8% at $22.17 on Tuesday. The post-IPO range has been $20.45 to $24.35. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Jon C.

Hillary Clinton. Andrew Harnik AP/Press Associate Images. All Rights Reserved.As this endless election limps toward its last days, while spiralling into a bizarre duel over vote-rigging accusations, a deep sigh is undoubtedly in order. The entire process has been an emotionally draining, frustration-inducing, rage-inflaming spectacle of repellent form over shallow substance. For many, the third debate evoked fatigue. More worrying, there was again no discussion of how to prevent another financial crisis, an ominous possibility in the next presidency, whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton enters the Oval Office — given that nothing fundamental has been altered when it comes to Wall Street’s practices and predation. At the heart of American political consciousness right now lies a soul-crushing reality for millions of distraught Americans: the choices for president couldn’t be feebler or more disappointing. On the one hand, we have a petulant, vocabulary-challenged man-boar of a billionaire, who hasn’t paid his taxes, has regularly left those supporting him holding the bag, and seems like a ludicrous composite of every bad trait in every bad date any woman has ever had. On the other hand, we’re offered a walking photo-op for and well-paid speechmaker to Wall-Street CEOs, a one-woman money-raising machine from the 1% of the 1%, who, despite a folksiness that couldn’t look more rehearsed, has methodically outplayed her opponent. With less than two weeks to go before E-day — despite the Trumptilian upheaval of the last year — the high probability of a Clinton win means the establishment remains intact. When we awaken on 9 November, it will undoubtedly be dawn in Hillary Clinton’s America and that potentially means four years of an economic dystopia that will (as would Donald Trump’s version of the same) leave many Americans rightfully anxious about their economic futures. None of the three presidential debates suggested that either candidate would have the ability (or desire) to confront Wall Street from the Oval Office. In the second and third debates, in case you missed them, Hillary didn’t even mention the Glass-Steagall Act, 'too-big-to-fail', or Wall Street. While in the first debate, the subject of Wall Street only came up after she disparaged the tax policies of “Trumped-up, trickle down economics” (or, as I like to call it, the Trumpledown economics of giving tax and financial benefits to the rich and to corporations). In this election, Hillary has crafted her talking points regarding the causes of the last financial crisis as weapons against Trump, but they hardly begin to tell the real story of what happened to the American economy. In this election, Hillary has crafted her talking points regarding the causes of the last financial crisis as weapons against Trump, but they hardly begin to tell the real story of what happened to the American economy. The meltdown of 2007 – 2008 was not mainly due to “tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy” or a “failure to invest in the middle class,” two subjects she has repeatedly highlighted to slam the Republicans and their candidate. It was a by-product of the destruction of the regulations that opened the way for a too-big-to-fail framework to thrive. Under the presidency of Bill Clinton, Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era act that once separated people’s bank deposits and loans from any kind of risky bets or other similar actions in which banks might engage, was repealed under the Financial Modernization Act of 1999. In addition, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act was passed, which allowed Wall Street to concoct devastating unregulated side bets on what became the subprime crisis. Given that the people involved with those choices are still around and some are still advising (or in the case of one former president living with) Hillary Clinton, it’s reasonable to imagine that, in January 2017, she’ll launch the third term of Bill Clinton when it comes to financial policy, banks, and the economy. Only now, the stakes are even higher, the banks larger, and their impunity still remarkably unchallenged. Consider president Obama’s current treasury secretary, Jack Lew. It was Hillary who hit the Clinton Rolodex to bring him back to Washington. Lew first entered Bill Clinton’s White House in 1993 as special assistant to the president.  Between his stints working for Clinton and Obama, he made his way into the private sector and eventually to Wall Street — as so many of his predecessors had done and successors would do. He scored a leadership role with Citigroup during the time that Bill Clinton’s former Treasury Secretary (and former Goldman Sachs co-Chairman) Robert Rubin was on its board of directors. In 2009, Hillary selected him to be her deputy secretary of state. Lew is hardly the only example of the busy revolving door to power that led from the Clinton administration to the Obama administration via Wall Street (or activities connected to it). Bill Clinton’s Treasury Under Secretary for International Affairs, Timothy Geithner worked with Robert Rubin, later championed Wall Street as president and CEO of the New York Federal Reserve while Hillary was senator from New York (representing Wall Street), and then became Obama’s first treasury secretary while Hillary was secretary of state. One possible contender for treasury secretary in a new Clinton administration would be Bill Clinton’s Under Secretary of Domestic Finance and Obama’s Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairman, Gary Gensler (who was — I’m sure you won’t be shocked — a Goldman Sachs partner before entering public service). These, then, are typical inhabitants of the Clinton inner circle and of the political-financial corridors of power. Their thinking, like Hillary’s, meshes well with support for the status quo in the banking system, even if, like her, they are willing on occasion to admonish it for its 'mistakes.' This through-line of personnel in and out of Clinton World is dangerous for most of the rest of us, because behind all the 'talking heads' and genuinely amusing Saturday Night Live skits about this bizarre election lie certain crucial issues that will have to be dealt with: decisions about climate change, foreign wars, student-loan unaffordability, rising income inequality, declining social mobility, and, yes, the threat of another financial crisis. And keep in mind that such a future economic meltdown isn’t an absurdly long-shot possibility. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve, the nation’s main bank regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the government entity that insures our bank deposits, collectively noted that seven of our biggest eight banks — Citigroup was the exception — still have inadequate emergency plans in the event of another financial crisis. Exploring a two-faced world Politicians regularly act one way publicly and another privately, as Hillary was 'outed' for doing by WikiLeaks via its document dump from Clinton campaign manager John Podesta’s hacked email account. Such realities should be treated as neither shockers nor smoking guns. Everybody postures. Everybody lies. Everybody’s two-faced in certain aspects of their lives. Politicians just make a career out of it. Everybody postures. Everybody lies. Everybody’s two-faced in certain aspects of their lives. Politicians just make a career out of it. What’s problematic about Hillary’s public and private positions in the economic sphere, at least, isn’t their two-facedness but how of a piece they are. Yes, she warned the bankers to “cut it out! Quit foreclosing on homes! Quit engaging in these kinds of speculative behaviours!” — but that was no demonstration of strength in relation to the big banks. Her comments revealed no real understanding of their precise role in exacerbating a fixable subprime loan calamity and global financial crisis, nor did her finger-wagging mean anything to Wall Street. Keep in mind that, during the build-up to that crisis, as banks took advantage of looser regulations, she collected more than $7 million from the securities and investment industry for her New York Senate runs ($18 million during her career). In her first Senate campaign, Citigroup was her top contributor.  The four Wall-Street-based banks (JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley) all feature among her top 10 career contributors. As a senator, she didn’t introduce any bills aimed at reforming or regulating Wall Street. During the lead-up to the financial crisis of 2007-2008, she did introduce five (out of 140) bills relating to the housing crisis, but they all died before making it through a Senate committee. So did a bill she sponsored to curtail corporate executive compensation. Though she has publicly called for a reduction in hedge-fund tax breaks (known as “closing the carried interest loophole”), including at the second debate, she never signed on to the bill that would have done so (one that Obama co-sponsored in 2007). Perhaps her most important gesture of support for Wall Street was her vote in favour of the $700 billion 2008 bank bailout bill. (Bernie Sanders opposed it.) After her secretary of state stint, she returned to the scene of banking crimes. Many times. As we know, she was also paid exceedingly well for it. Friendship with the Clintons doesn’t come cheap. As she said in October 2013, while speaking at a Goldman Sachs AIMS Alternative Investments’ Symposium, “running for office in our country takes a lot of money, and candidates have to go out and raise it. New York is probably the leading site for contributions for fundraising for candidates on both sides of the aisle.” After her secretary of state stint, she returned to the scene of banking crimes. Many times.  Between 2013 and 2015, she gave 12 speeches to Wall Street banks, private equity firms, and other financial corporations, reaping a whopping $2,935,000 for them. In her 2016 presidential run, the securities and investment sector (aka Wall Street) has contributed the most of any industry to PACs supporting Hillary: $56.4 million. Yes, everybody needs to make a buck or a few million of them. This is America after all, but Hillary was a political figure paid by the same banks routinely getting slapped with criminal settlements by the Department of Justice. In addition, the Clinton Foundation counted as generous donors all four of the major Wall Street-based mega-banks. She was voracious when it came to such money and tone-deaf when it came to the irony of it all. Glass-Steagall and Bernie Sanders Hillary Clinton. Andrew Harnik AP/Press Associate Images. All Rights Reserved. One of the more illuminating aspects of the Podesta emails was a series of communications that took place in the fall of 2015. That’s when Bernie Sanders was gaining traction for, among other things, his calls to break up the big banks and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933. The Clinton administration’s dismantling of that act in 1999 had freed the big banks to use their depositors’ money as collateral for risky bets in the real estate market and elsewhere, and so allowed them to become ever more engorged with questionable securities. On 7 December 7 2015, with her campaign well under way and worried about the Sanders challenge, the Clinton camp debuted a key Hillary op-ed, “How I’d Rein in Wall Street,” in the New York Times. This followed two months of emails and internal debate within her campaign over whether supporting the return of Glass-Steagall was politically palatable for her and whether not supporting it would antagonise senator Elizabeth Warren. In the end, though Glass-Steagall was mentioned in passing in her op-ed, she chose not to endorse its return. She explained her decision not to do so this way (and her advisers and media apostles have stuck with this explanation ever since): “Some have urged the return of a Depression-era rule called Glass-Steagall, which separated traditional banking from investment banking. But many of the firms that contributed to the crash in 2008, like A.I.G. and Lehman Brothers, weren’t traditional banks, so Glass-Steagall wouldn’t have limited their reckless behaviour. Nor would restoring Glass-Steagall help contain other parts of the ‘shadow banking’ sector, including certain activities of hedge funds, investment banks, and other non-bank institutions.” Her entire characterization of how the 2007-2008 banking crisis unfolded was — well — wrong. Here’s how traditional banks (like JPMorgan Chase) operated: they lent money to investment banks like Lehman Brothers so that they could buy more financial waste products stuffed with subprime mortgages that these traditional banks were, in turn, trying to sell. They then backed up those toxic financial products through insurance companies like AIG, which came close to collapse when what it was insuring became too toxically overwhelming to afford. AIG then got a $182 billion government bailout that also had the effect of bailing out those traditional banks (including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which became 'traditional' during the crisis). In this way, the whole vicious cycle started with the traditional banks that hold your deposits and at the same time could produce and sell those waste products thanks to the repeal of Glass-Steagall. So yes, the loss of that act caused the crisis and, in its wake, every big traditional bank was fined for crisis-related crimes. Hillary won’t push to bring back Glass-Steagall. Doing so would dismantle her husband’s legacy and that of the men he and she appointed to public office. Whatever cosmetic alterations may be in store, count on that act remaining an artefact of the past, since its resurrection would dismay the bankers who, over the past three decades, made the Clintons what they are. Hillary won’t push to bring back Glass-Steagall. Doing so would dismantle her husband’s legacy and that of the men he and she appointed to public office. No wonder many diehard Sanders supporters remain disillusioned and sceptical — not to speak of the fact that their candidate featured dead last (thirty-ninth) on a list of recommended vice presidential candidates in the Podesta emails. That's unfortunately how much his agenda is likely to matter to her in the Oval Office. Go regulate yourselves! Before he resigned with his nine-figure golden parachute, Wells Fargo CEO and Chairman John Stumpf addressed Congress over disclosures that 5,300 of his employees had created two million fake accounts, scamming $2.4 million from existing customers. The bank was fined $185 million for that (out of a total $10 billion in fines for a range of other crimes committed before and during the financial crisis). In response, Hillary wrote a letter to Wells Fargo’s customers. In it, she didn’t actually mention Stumpf by name, as she has not mentioned any Wall Street CEO by name in the context of criminal activity. Instead, she simply spoke of “he.”  As she put it, “He owes all of you a clear explanation as to how this happened under his watch.” She added, “Executives should be held individually accountable when rampant illegal activity happens on their watch.” She does have a plan to fine banks for being too big, but they’ve already been fined repeatedly for being crooked and it hasn’t made them any smaller or less threatening.  As their top officials evidently view the matter, paying up for breaking the law is just another cost of doing business. Hillary also wrote, “If any bank can’t be managed effectively, it should be broken up.” But the question is: Why doesn’t ongoing criminal activity that threatens the rest of us correlate with ineffective management — or put another way, when was the last time you saw a major bank broken up? And don’t hold your breath for that to happen in a new Clinton administration either. In her public letter, she added, “I’ll appoint regulators who will stand with taxpayers and consumers, not with big banks and their friends in Congress.”  On the other hand, at that same Goldman Sachs symposium, while in fundraising mode, she gave bankers a pass relative to regulators and commented: “Well, I represented all of you for eight years. I had great relations and worked so close together after 9/11 to rebuild downtown, and [I have] a lot of respect for the work you do and the people who do it.” She has steadfastly worked to craft explanations for the financial crisis and the Great Recession that don’t endanger the banks as we presently know them. In addition, she has supported the idea of appointing insider regulators, insisting that “the people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry.” (Let’s not forget that former Goldman Sachs CEO and Chairman Hank Paulson ran the Treasury Department while the crisis brewed.)  Among the emails sent to John Podesta that were posted by WikiLeaks is an article I wrote for TomDispatch on the Clintons' relationships with bankers. “She will not point fingers at her friends," I said in that piece in May 2015. “She will not chastise the people who pay her hundreds of thousands of dollars a pop to speak or the ones who have long shared the social circles in which she and her husband move.” I also suggested that she wouldn't call out any CEO by name. To this day she hasn’t. I said that she would never be an advocate for Glass-Steagall. And she hasn’t been. What was true then will be no less true once she’s in the White House and no longer has to make gestures toward the platform on which Bernie ran and so can once again more openly embrace the bankers’ way of conducting business. She will not chastise the people who pay her hundreds of thousands of dollars a pop to speak or the ones who have long shared the social circles in which she and her husband move. There’s a reason Wall Street has a crush on her and its monarchs like Goldman Sachs CEO and Chairman Lloyd Blankfein pay her such stunning sums to offer anodyne remarks to their employees and others. Blankfein has been coy about an official Clinton endorsement simply because he doesn’t want to rock her campaign boat, but make no mistake, this Wall Street kingpin’s silence is tantamount to an endorsement. To date, $10 trillion worth of assets sits on the books of the Big Six banks. Since 2008, these same banks have copped to more than $150 billion in fines for pre-crisis behaviour that ranged on the spectrum of criminality from manipulating multiple public markets to outright fraud. Hillary Clinton has arguably taken money that would not have been so available if it weren’t for the ill-gotten gains those banks secured. In her usual measured way, albeit with some light admonishments, she has told them what they want to hear: that if they behave — something that in her dictionary of definitions involves little in the way of personalised pain or punishment — so will she. So let’s recap Hillary’s America, past, present, and future. It’s a land lacking in meaningful structural reform of the financial system, a place where the big banks have been, and will continue to be, coddled by the government. No CEO will be jailed, no matter how large the fines his bank is saddled with or how widespread the crimes it committed. Instead, he’s likely to be invited to the inaugural ball in January. Because its practices have not been adequately controlled or curtailed, the inherent risk that Wall Street poses for Main Street will only grow as bankers continue to use our money to make their bets. (The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act was supposed to help on this score, but has yet to make the big banks any smaller.) And here’s an obvious corollary to all this: the next bank-instigated economic catastrophe will not be dealt with until it has once again crushed the financial stability of millions of Americans. The banks have voted with their dollars on all of this in multiple ways. Hillary won’t do anything to upset that applecart. We should have no illusions about what her presidency would mean from a Wall Street vs. Main Street perspective. Certainly, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon doesn't. He effectively endorsed Hillary before a crowd of financial industry players, saying, "I hope the next president, she reaches across the aisle." For Wall Street, of course, that aisle is essentially illusory, since its players operate so easily and effectively on both sides of it. In Hillary’s America, Wall Street will still own Main Street.

This group, which includes top bankers like JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and powerful investors like Carl Icahn and Berkshire Hathaway Inc's Warren Buffett, were eschewing electronic communications long before the probe of US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's emails and the recent hacks of her campaign manager's account made headlines.

In one message, Dimon replied with a simple “I approve,” showing some responsibility but giving no sense of how deeply he was involved with the decision to change risk tolerances at the bank.

Given all of the October surprises, investors may be ill-prepared for another on Nov. 8. Renewed controversy over Hillary Clinton’s e-mails “is not likely to cause a fundamental shift in the presidential race,” analysts at Evercore ISI said in a report dated Oct. 30. The biggest shock would be a victory by Republican Donald Trump or a sweep by the Democrats. Either could send investors running for cover into the safest government bonds, U.S. dollars and the yen and fleeing from riskier equities and emerging markets, much like the aftermath of the U.K.’s June vote to leave the European Union. Beyond that, both candidates want to increase spending and cut taxes which would be bullish for stocks and bearish for fixed income. All the Ways This Election Day Will Be Different: QuickTake Q&A Below is a look at potential winners and losers depending on who wins and loses. But first, a caveat. Investors’ immediate reaction to U.S. elections often doesn’t last, as shown by this chart: With that... Stocks Clinton Wins: “The market has already priced in a Clinton victory,” Margaret Yang, a CMC Markets analyst in Singapore, said by phone. “Any upside will be limited if she wins.” Barclays PLC said in a report this week that the S&P 500 Index could gain as much as 3 percent if she wins. The biggest losers would be finance and drug companies. “A potential Democratic sweep would represent one of the toughest election outcomes for banks,” Morgan Stanley Research said in a report, citing the possibility of tougher rules and tax changes that might hurt companies like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Moves against carried-interest rules that benefit asset managers, also targeted by Trump, would hurt firms including Janus Capital Group Inc. and Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. Under Clinton, pharmaceutical and biotech stocks “could be hit by renewed pressure to curb price increases on drugs,” BlackRock Inc. researchers said in a report, noting her complaints about rising prices. Citigroup Inc. cut its rating on the European health-care industry to underweight in September, citing risks related to the election. Drugmakers Novo Nordisk A/S and Roche Holding AG have trailed the broader market this year as Clinton’s prospects rose, with the shares gaining only during times when her polling numbers fell. Hospital operators and Medicaid providers such as HCA Holdings Inc. and Universal Health Services Inc. may benefit from continued Affordable Care Act subsidies, according to analysts from Strategas Research Partners, LPL Financial Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG. Her plans to reduce dependence on fossil fuels would boost alternative energy producers, with Morgan Stanley touting the prospects of Sunrun Inc. and NextEra Energy Inc. with the Democrat in the White House. Strategas also likes First Solar Inc. under Clinton. Evercore’s report adds General Electric Co., Tesla Motors Inc., SolarCity Corp. and Exelon Corp. to the list. Trump Wins: “Valuations of U.S. equities are quite high, and a Trump victory will trigger a massive selloff,” CMC’s Yang said. Many would consider that a classic “black swan event,” she added, so the reaction would be “much more severe” than Brexit, which caused the S&P 500 Index to fall 5.3 percent in two days as benchmarks in Europe and elsewhere lost even more. Investors seeking haven in the yen would be “a negative for Japanese exporters,” Yang said. Barclays predicted the S&P 500 would nosedive by between 11 percent and 13 percent if Trump wins. The Republican’s shifting policy positions make his longer-term impact on particular sectors harder to assess. BlackRock’s analysis of the correlation between the two candidate’s polling numbers and sector stock performance suggest drugmakers, insurers and banks are expected to do better under Trump. Bloomberg News did a similar analysis for individual U.S. stocks. Though finance companies may prefer Trump, BlackRock warned that repealing the post-crisis Dodd-Frank law, derided by the industry’s Republican allies, may result in “simpler and blunter but equally onerous rules.” Almost all sectors of the health care industry, from device-makers to providers, would benefit under Trump, BlackRock said. Companies that build and maintain civil infrastructure, such as Caterpillar Inc. and Ingersoll-Rand Corp., would have bigger opportunities for government work under Trump, given that his plans for such spending are much more ambitious than Clinton’s. The same holds true for military contractors, according to a Credit Suisse report. Morgan Stanley sees NRG Energy Inc., which uses coal to produce electricity, benefiting under a Republican White House, due to less regulation and slower growth in the use of renewables. Bonds Clinton Wins: A victory by the Democrat would initially drive up yields as investors sell off Treasuries in favor of riskier assets, Bank of America Corp. analysts said in a report. Ripple effects would raise borrowing costs for individuals and corporations worldwide because U.S. sovereigns are the global debt benchmark. Yields on 10-year U.S. bonds have risen as much as 36 basis points since Clinton’s lead over Trump started widening in late July, and the bank’s analysts called the Democratic Party’s improving prospects “a major factor” behind that move. Over the longer term, a Clinton victory would do little to yields -- as long as Republicans retain control of at least one chamber of Congress -- because her fiscal stimulus would be relatively small, especially compared to Trump’s plans for bigger tax cuts and more infrastructure spending. A Democratic sweep would likely result in more spending and drive yields higher. Municipal debt could gain under Clinton because any increased taxes she imposes on the wealthy would make tax-free bonds more attractive, BlackRock said. Trump Wins: In the two weeks after the U.K. gobsmacked pollsters and voted to leave the EU on June 23, the U.S. benchmark 10-year yield fell 39 basis points and didn’t return to pre-Brexit levels until September. Something akin to that would happen if Trump defies conventional wisdom, analysts said. Credit Agricole SA predicts a “massive disjoint” that would send 10-year yields down at least 10 basis points if he prevails. After the dust settles, Trump’s tax cuts and infrastructure-spending plans may drive yields back up, especially if Republicans hold both the House and Senate. That impact could be exaggerated if the Republican’s isolationist foreign policy prompts countries with large Treasury stakes to unload them, Credit Agricole analysts said. Fiscal largess would also benefit inflation-linked bonds, which already are outperforming nominal securities this year. Yields would only remain flat under Trump , according to Bank of America, in the unlikeliest event of all: President Trump finds himself up against Democrats controlling both houses of Congress, because they would resist his massive tax cuts. Trump’s support for fossil fuels could spur a rebound for energy industry bonds, especially high-yield ones, after two years of major losses in the commodities slump, Wells Fargo & Co. said in a report. As for munis, “Trump’s plan to slash personal tax rates could deal a blow to the asset class,” BlackRock’s report said. Currencies Clinton Wins: The U.S. dollar would gain versus other developed-market currencies with the Democrat heading toward the White House as traders focus attention on the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in December, according to Capital Economics, a London-based research firm. Down the road, Bank of America sees the greenback gaining under Clinton only if the Democrats take Congress. Currencies from emerging markets have mostly priced in a Clinton win, which would be neutral or positive for all countries except Russia, Societe Generale SA said in a report. The Bloomberg Barclays Emerging Markets Local Currency Broad Government Index has gained 17 percent since its all-time low on Jan. 21. Mexico’s peso would benefit from a Clinton win more than any other emerging-market currency, Societe Generale said. It has acted as a barometer of the presidential contest, tending to move in tandem with her chances of defeating a candidate who promised to make the U.S.’s southern neighbor pay for a wall between the two countries. Look for China’s yuan to “strengthen modestly in response to a Clinton win as currencies sensitive to the outlook for global trade rally in relief,” said Sean Callow, senior strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney. Trump Wins: Following the immediate shock of a Trump win, the U.S. dollar may weaken as developed-market currencies including the yen (a traditional haven), euro, pound and franc rally on concern that China would dump U.S. assets and the Fed would delay tightening monetary policy. The greenback could then rally in a three- to nine-month horizon as Republicans usher in tax cuts and other fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth, Bank of America said. Obviously, the Mexican peso would take a hit if Trump wins. Elsewhere, the candidate’s hostility toward China -- including threats of steep tariffs over alleged currency manipulation -- likely would drive the offshore yuan down about 3 percent by year’s end, said Ken Cheung, a foreign-exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Hong Kong. Longer term, the currency may fall more gradually under Trump as he exerts political pressure on the country’s leaders to slow its depreciation, said Xu Gao, an economist at Everbright Securities Co. in Beijing. Risk adversity in the aftermath of a Trump win would also hurt other developing-world currencies on fears that his protectionist stances could hurt emerging economies by reducing imports from them. The South Korean won may take a hit, given questions Trump has raised about the need for U.S. troops on the North Korean boarder. Emerging Markets Clinton Wins: It’ll be risk-on if the Democrat retains control of the White House, which bodes well for developing markets. Investors may respond by bidding up Chinese defense shares because she comes across as the more hawkish candidate, said Francis Cheung, head of China and Hong Kong strategy at CLSA Ltd. Commodity producers in the developing world might rally on expectations that U.S. demand will increase along with infrastructure spending. Trump Wins: “I can’t think of any country that would benefit if Trump wins,” CMC Markets’ Yang said. Evercore’s report mentioned one nation that might get a boost, suggesting investors buy Russian equities to hedge against the Clinton-leaning polls being wrong. Citigroup sees the MSCI Emerging Markets Index immediately falling at least 10 percent, with Mexican stocks leading the way down. One possible bright spot for Mexico: Construction companies such as Cemex SAB de CV may be positioned for contracts to build Trump’s proposed border wall. In Asia, “China will bear the brunt of risks if Trump wins,” said Ken Peng, an investment strategist at Citi Private Bank in Hong Kong, by phone. “He’ll probably introduce trade policies targeted against China,” weakening its economy. Protectionist U.S. policies also would be “bad for a lot of economies that rely a lot on exports,” said Ben Bei, an analyst at CIMB Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. Peng said exporters from South Korea and Taiwan are among those with the most to lose. Yang adds Southeast Asia exporters to the list, including companies in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. To the extent that Trump is less welcoming to workers from abroad, his victory may hurt the Philippines’ broader economy, which gets the bulk of its overseas remittances from Filipinos employed in the U.S., Yang said. “India and Indonesia will be least affected if Trump wins,” due to their robust domestic growth, Peng said. Commodities Clinton Wins: Her environmental policies, especially her promise to combat climate change, will put pressure on coal and oil. The natural gas market could get a boost from her pledge to wean power plants off coal by using gas as “a bridge” to more reliance on renewables. Trump Wins: Natural gas prices likely would suffer as coal benefits under Trump. He has promised to roll back environmental rules that squeeze coal out of the U.S. power market and promoted “clean coal” during one of the debates. Bloomberg Intelligence in September estimated that a victory by the Republican would shave 11 percent off natural gas demand in 2030 from last year’s levels, boosting coal use. Oil prices could get a lift from the return of a risk premium if Trump continues with the “bellicose language that’s been heard on the campaign trail” about Iran and scraps President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with the country, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York hedge fund focused on energy. Gold, platinum and silver would the “biggest winners” if Trump wins, said Yang, the CMC Markets analyst. To see why, look at what happened on Oct. 28 after the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that it will examine newly discovered e-mails relevant of its inquiry of Clinton’s use of a private Internet server as secretary of state: Gold futures rallied to a three-week high because demand for the metal as a haven jumped. The other precious metals followed bullion’s lead. Copper may also get a bounce, Barclays said, citing moves in the metal’s price during the campaign suggesting “a Trump-related premium in infrastructure-related assets given expectations around his fiscal plan.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Big Data Cloud Computing Fintech Infosec Internet of Things Martech Wearable Tech What the Dyn DDoS Attacks Taught Us About Cloud-Only EFSS Posted November 1, 2016 By CloudTweaks Cloud-Only EFSS October 21st, 2016 went into the annals of Internet history for the large scale Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks that made popular Internet properties like Twitter, SoundCloud, Spotify and Box inaccessible to many users in the US. The DDoS attack happened in three waves targeting DNS service provider Dyn, resulting in a total of about three hours of service outage. The attack was orchestrated using a botnet of connected devices including a large number of webcams sold by a single manufacturer, which simultaneously made tens of millions of DNS requests on Dyn’s servers. Given the impact and severity, Dyn was quick to release a statement that more fully explained the incident from their side. DDoS attacks can be carried out in many ways and can either target individual properties, or services that support a multiple Internet properties. DNS services are common targets because they are essential to the operation of cloud-based services. Cyber Attacks are Getting Increasingly Sophisticated There’s a growing trend of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks targeting governments, political organizations, financial institutions and businesses in general. Victims of high-profile breaches in recent years include Target, eBay, Home Depot, JPMorgan Chase, LinkedIn, FDIC and Ashley Madison, but these are only a few notable names. Even as government and private organizations embrace cloud-based services, attacks such as the one on 10/21 should compel them to reevaluate “all in on the cloud” approaches to platforms, applications and data. While I am not advocating completely pulling back from the cloud and into on-premises systems, this is a situation that pleads for a diversified risk mitigation strategy. Organizations need to have solutions in place that will not interrupt operations and kill productivity during situations like this. As we have always advocated, a hybrid solution can certainly mitigate risk and give organizations alternative ways to work in the event of attacks or outages. The Polarity Problem A major problem for many organizations is their polar philosophies around infrastructure, the thinking that everything has to be in one place or another – either in the cloud or on-premises. Here’s where hybrid approaches come into their own. What if your application ran on the public cloud, but failed over to an on-premises or private cloud instance in the event of a public-cloud outage? What if your content (data) could reside in the cloud, on-premises or in both places simultaneously, depending how business critical, voluminous or regulated it is? Consider the Enterprise File Synchronization and Sharing (EFSS) solution space. Cloud-only providers like Box and Dropbox – that emerged as consumer services and subsequently moved into the business segment – arguably don’t account for the mission-critical use cases of governments and businesses, and their need for business continuity in the event of such outages. Consider how your organization will be impacted if all its corporate information resided in the cloud, and a DDoS or other form of cyber attack (or even a natural calamity) brought the cloud infrastructure down for several hours. How will it affect employee productivity? What would the revenue impact be? How would your brand image be affected? For most organizations, the impact of a cloud outage will be very significant. As such, exploring hybrid approaches becomes mission critical. Hybrid is the Answer MJM, a marketing and communications agency owned by WPP, initially used a cloud-only EFSS service for file sharing and collaboration but moved over to Egnyte a few years ago after realizing that what it really needed was a hybrid file sharing solution. Thankfully they did, as disaster struck in 2012 during Hurricane Sandy, devastated the Northeast Coastline in the United States. With no internet and power going in and out, the employees at MJM were still able to work through the disaster and not lose any time or money. When it comes to the enterprise, we have a steadfast philosophy that: 1) Enterprises need purpose-built solutions. From our inception, we’ve had a razor-sharp focus on serving the file sharing needs of organizations rather than consumers. 2) While we enthusiastically embraced the cloud, we’ve always been aware that our customers need safeguards. Our hybrid approach to file sharing allows customers to leverage the advantages of both cloud and on-premises infrastructures for agility, reliability and business continuity. If your cloud provider suffers an outage, a hybrid solution can seamlessly failover to your on-premises infrastructure and ensure that users, business processes and workflows remain unaffected. What’s more, these solutions can seamlessly failover to your on-premises infrastructure and ensure that users, business processes and workflows remain unaffected. It is best to assume that Internet outages are inevitable, and plan for continued access to essential files when your cloud infrastructure or Internet connectivity become unavailable. When the next outage occurs, will you be prepared?

The meat supplier, partly-owned by KKR and Baring Private Equity, opened in the morning about 6.5 per cent below HK$2.00 set for the offering of its 975.6 million shares – already at the bottom end of its marketed price range as a result of tepid investor appetite. Shares closed Tuesday at HK$1.66, down 17 per cent from the float price. The benchmark Hang Seng Index edged up 0.93 per cent. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley were joint sponsors of the US$251 million IPO, according to filings to the Hong Kong stock exchange. “Cofco Meat only managed to turn to profits last year following two years of losses, which obviously did not offer a good reason for investors to buy,” said Sam Chi-yung, a senior strategist with South China Financial Holdings. The floundering debut of the Beijing-based hog producer drew parallels to a slew of companies whose shares limped out of the starting gate after high-profile IPOs over the last a few months. China Resources Pharmaceutical, the country’s second biggest drugmaker, and Postal Savings Bank, the world’s largest IPO this year, both failed to ignite investor enthusiasm on their debut, after raising billions of US dollars in their mega public offerings. Cofco Meat only managed to turned to profits last year following two years of losses Sam Chi-yung, South China Financial Holdings. Local media reported Ma Jianping, president of Cofco Meat, saying Tuesday morning that “it was common to see stock price volatility”. Last week, rival WH Group, the country’s biggest pork producer, plunged the most in almost two years after its second biggest shareholder private equity firm CDH slashed its holding to 12.94 per cent after selling HK$10.6 billion through a share placement. WH Group’s main subsidiary Shuanghui Development posted worse-than-expected third quarter earnings, with its net profit slipping 0.96 per cent from a year earlier. China’s pork prices entered a downward spiral starting from June, while high inventory costs continued to weigh on the bottom line of the country’s leading hog producers, analysts said. Cofo Meat’s cornerstone investors include Haier Group, which committed US$57.4 million, and China Life Insurance, the country’s biggest insurer, which agreed to invest US$20 million.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Hong Kong property experts ‘shocked’ at record sale result for Kai Tak area site 2 Outdated fintech regulations hurting Hong Kong, Jack Ma says 3 The next black swan could be fast approaching from a region that few are talking about 4 China, Russia join the crowded sky: widebody planes to cut reliance on Airbus, Boeing 5 Zhongwang says it’ll bring jobs stability to Aleris, hits back at US opposition to US$2.3 bln takeover Shared 1 Hong Kong property experts ‘shocked’ at record sale result for Kai Tak area site 2 Outdated fintech regulations hurting Hong Kong, Jack Ma says 3 Two-thirds of smartphone users now paying by mobile 4 The next black swan could be fast approaching from a region that few are talking about 5 Zhongwang says it’ll bring jobs stability to Aleris, hits back at US opposition to US$2.3 bln takeover Commented 1 Beijing interpretation on Legislative Council oath taking rattles Hong Kong 2 Hong Kong oath-taking saga shows ugly side of city’s colonial legacy 3 Mainland paper slams Hong Kong independence advocates in 1,000-word commentary 4 Youngspiration duo increasingly isolated by pan-democratic allies, as antics cause harm and chaos 5 Time to resume talks, Taiwanese president tells the mainland Promotions Order your FREE copy of the MICE BIZ 2016 2H       You may also like China How new Xinjiang party boss became front runner in race to be one of China’s most powerful men 30 Oct 2016 - 11:24pm 2 Shaping up: Home-grown app, Green WALK Hong Kong, is the pick of the mobile apps In partnership with: HKT PREMIER Why bankers and cocaine are best of friends 30 Oct 2016 - 8:46pm 9 The expanded campus at GSIS highlights the school’s commitment to improvement Brought to you by: German Swiss International School Hong Kong Illegal fees, little rest and no documents: domestic helpers in Hong Kong continue to fight for their rights 30 Oct 2016 - 8:07am 21 Hong Kong Should history lessons in schools include details about Hong Kong’s 1967 riots? 30 Oct 2016 - 10:29pm 9 China A billion billion calculations per second: where no computer has gone before 29 Oct 2016 - 8:00am 4 Hong Kong Meet Viveca Chow, Broadway musical star from Hong Kong Oct 28th 2016, 11:57pm World Plane bursts into flame at Chicago airport Oct 29th 2016, 3:45pm China China has world’s most skewed sex ratio at birth – again 27 Oct 2016 - 10:04pm 2 Post Magazine The Asian men who buy sex with Cambodian virgins 28 Oct 2016 - 10:54am 3 Post Magazine With the paedophile-hunters on the streets of Phnom Penh 28 Oct 2016 - 10:55am 1 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!
