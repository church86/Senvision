Belvedere | @Matt_Belvedere Friday, 4 Nov 2016 | 12:07 PM ETCNBC.com SHARES show chapters <p>October jobs report pointing to full employment?</p> <p>Discussing the October jobs report and its potential implication for the Federal Reserve with David Kelly, JPMorgan Funds Chief Global Strategist, and Vincent Reinhart, Standish Mellon Asset Management Chief Economist.</p> October jobs report pointing to full employment?    Friday, 4 Nov 2016 | 10:01 AM ET | 03:22 The October jobs report was "very good" and indicates the economy is running at "full employment," JPMorgan Asset Management Chief Global Strategist David Kelly told CNBC on Friday. Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Standish Mellon, agreed in the same "Squawk on the Street" interview. The Federal Reserve views full employment as the level of employment that does not push up on inflation or bring inflation down. Even though nonfarm job growth of 161,000 last month was slightly worse than expected, wage growth as measured by average hourly earnings posted a 2.8 percent annualized increase. That's the largest rise in seven years. The unemployment rate ticked down slightly to 4.9 percent. The numbers do seem to add to the case for a December interest rate hike. Central banks last increased the cost of borrowing in December 2015, the first such move in more than nine years. "There's evidence on labor hoarding on the part of firms. You don't see many quits [or] many layoffs. The fact that they've got to pay workers more to keep them on the job tells you the market is pretty hot," Reinhart said. But for Kelly, the wage growth number did not tell the biggest story. "To me, the most remarkable statistic ... is the number of people who are short-term unemployed — people unemployed less than five weeks. That is lower than it's been 98 percent of the time in the last 50 years." In October, the number of people unemployed less than five weeks was nearly 2.4 million on a seasonally adjusted basis, down from 2.57 million in September. "We are basically out of easily employable workers," Kelly argued. Reinhart said there's no doubt the labor market has been tightening, but "composition of the job gains isn't very attractive." "We're getting service employment but not manufacturing employments. We're getting the lower wages rather than the higher paying wage industries hiring," he explained. "That's bad for income distribution. It's bad for income growth generally." Meanwhile, the labor-force participation rate in October edged lower to 62.8 percent, and remained around the low levels last seen in the late-1970s. Kelly called the participation rate "the most abused statistic" in all of economics, saying the reason for the low rate is because "baby boomers are retiring by the millions," not that people are giving up and dropping out of the workforce. Out of what he calls the many "misused economic statistics," Reinhart said he'd put the participation rate lower on his list.

"Following" : "Follow"}} November 04, 2016 11:18am   Comments Share: Related W Williams-Sonoma Down To Neutral At Baird Ahead Of Q3 Earnings 22 Stocks Moving In Tuesday's Pre-Market Session Wayfair Inc (NYSE: W) stock popped into many traders radars Friday following unconfirmed reports that analysts at JPMorgan had made negative comments on the stock. According to the chatter, analysts at JPMorgan see Wayfair's sales in the bottom half of 2016 being at risk. Wayfair is one of the stocks that Citron's Andrew Left highlighted as an attractive short. In fact, Left told Benzinga on Friday that the "only thing" Wayfair has going for it is sales and investors should "forget about profits." He mentioned that the stock should be "cut in half." Wayfair's stock hit an intra-day low of $31.55 and was recently trading around $31.96. Citron Research commented on Wayfair on August 31, 2015, and suggested that Wayfair's stock is the "most mispriced" in years. Citron's report resulted in a selloff in Wayfair's stock which closed that trading session at $37.30. "First we would like to stress the obvious, which everyone except the company and the analysts will admit," Citron said in its short report last August. "Wayfair is Overstock, plain and simple. The only difference is that Overstock has better brand recognition and higher traffic." Citron added, "for longs, a challenge: Finish this sentence: Wayfair is the next __________________________???... Exactly." Left reaffirmed his bearish stance on Bloomberg TV back in February. "At $10 a share this is still a billion dollar company," he said. "There is nothing about this company that is even worth a billion dollars."

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Investors are increasing their hedges against Donald Trump pulling off a stunning upset on Nov. 8 and upending assumptions that the U.S. election would result in more of the same, a Democrat in the White House kept in check by Republicans in Congress. The S&P 500 Index is on its longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis, shedding about 3 percent in eight days, or roughly the number of points Hillary Clinton’s lead has shrunk in that period. Since the Federal Bureau of Investigation reignited controversy over her e-mail practices on Oct. 28, haven assets are rising and riskier ones are falling. That’s in line with -- albeit less dramatic than -- what analysts have said will happen if the Republican wins, much like the aftermath of the U.K.’s June vote to leave the European Union. “In case of a Trump win, we envision a violent flight to quality,” Barclays Plc said in a report. A Democratic sweep may also be disruptive, though that’s an increasingly remote possibility. JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised a third potential surprise in a report that it said may produce a similar market reaction. The title said it all: “I demand a recount.” The recent moves reflect worries that investors aren’t sure whether to believe reassurances from analysts including Morgan Stanley (Clinton “still favored”) and Citigroup Inc. (toss-up “overstates” Trump’s odds). Over the longer term, both candidates want to increase spending and cut taxes which would be bullish for stocks and bearish for fixed income. Below is a look at potential winners and losers. But first, a caveat. Investors’ immediate reaction to U.S. elections often doesn’t last, as shown by this chart: With that... Stocks Clinton Wins: “The market has already priced in a Clinton victory,” said Margaret Yang, a CMC Markets analyst in Singapore. “Any upside will be limited if she wins.” Barclays Plc said in a report this week that the S&P 500 Index could gain as much as 3 percent after a Clinton triumph. Beyond an initial “risk-relief rally on the prospect of policy continuity and predictability,” Deutsche Bank AG said that Clinton’s plans to limit the capital gains tax break may “have negative/dampening impact on some key risk bellwether assets like equities into the turn of the year.” The biggest losers would be finance and drug companies. “A potential Democratic sweep would represent one of the toughest election outcomes for banks,” Morgan Stanley said in a report, citing the risk of tougher rules and tax changes that might hurt companies like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Moves against carried-interest rules that benefit asset managers, also targeted by Trump, would hurt firms including Janus Capital Group Inc. and Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. Under Clinton, pharmaceutical and biotech stocks “could be hit by renewed pressure to curb price increases on drugs,” BlackRock Inc. researchers said in a report, noting her complaints about rising costs. Citigroup Inc. cut its rating on the European health-care industry to underweight in September, citing U.S. election risks. Drugmakers Novo Nordisk A/S and Roche Holding AG have trailed the broader market this year as Clinton’s prospects rose, with the shares gaining only during times when her polling numbers fell. Hospital operators and Medicaid providers such as HCA Holdings Inc. and Universal Health Services Inc. may benefit from continued Affordable Care Act subsidies, according to analysts from Strategas Research Partners, LPL Financial Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG. Her plans to reduce dependence on fossil fuels would boost alternative energy producers, with Morgan Stanley touting the prospects of Sunrun Inc. and NextEra Energy Inc. under Clinton. Strategas also likes First Solar Inc. in that scenario. Evercore ISI adds General Electric Co., Tesla Motors Inc., SolarCity Corp. and Exelon Corp. to the list in its pre-election report. A Democratic sweep increases the odds for a minimum wage hike, which cuts both ways for consumer stocks, Morgan Stanley said. Trump Wins: “Valuations of U.S. equities are quite high, and a Trump victory will trigger a massive selloff,” CMC’s Yang said. Many would consider that a classic “black swan event,” she added, so the reaction would be “much more severe” than Brexit, which caused the S&P 500 Index to fall 5.3 percent in two days as benchmarks in Europe and elsewhere lost even more. Investors seeking haven in the yen would be “a negative for Japanese exporters,” Yang said. Barclays predicted the S&P 500 may nosedive by between 11 percent and 13 percent if Trump wins. Citigroup equity strategist Tobias Levkovich put the hit at no more than 5 percent in a report Thursday. The Republican’s shifting policy positions make his longer-term impact on particular sectors harder to assess. BlackRock’s analysis of the correlation between the two candidate’s polling numbers and sector stock performance suggest drugmakers, insurers and banks are expected to do better under Trump. Bloomberg News did a similar analysis for individual U.S. stocks. Even some of these sectors, however, face Trump-related risks. He favors repealing Obamacare and allowing the importation of prescription drugs, which could hurt pharmaceutical companies, Morgan Stanley said. And finance companies may prefer Trump, but BlackRock warned that repealing the post-crisis Dodd-Frank law, derided by the industry’s Republican allies, may result in “simpler and blunter but equally onerous rules.” Companies that build and maintain civil infrastructure, such as Caterpillar Inc. and Ingersoll-Rand Corp., would have bigger opportunities for government work under Trump, given that his plans for such spending are much more ambitious than Clinton’s. The same holds true for military contractors, Credit Suisse said. Morgan Stanley sees NRG Energy Inc., which uses coal to produce electricity, benefiting under a Republican White House, due to less regulation and slower growth in the use of renewables. The bank said consumer stocks could be hurt by a Trump win because tougher immigration restrictions could crimp labor supply and consumer demand. Bonds Clinton Wins: A victory by the Democrat would initially drive up yields as investors sell off Treasuries in favor of riskier assets, Bank of America Corp. analysts said in a report. Ripple effects would raise borrowing costs for individuals and corporations worldwide because U.S. sovereigns are the global debt benchmark. Yields on 10-year U.S. bonds have risen as much as 36 basis points since Clinton’s lead over Trump started widening in late July, and the bank’s analysts called the Democratic Party’s improving prospects “a major factor” behind that move. They’ve fallen a bit since the FBI’s Oct. 28 announcement about the e-mails. Market participants surveyed by Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, predicted an average increase of 5 basis points if Clinton wins, he said Thursday. Over the longer term, a Clinton victory would do little to yields -- as long as Republicans retain control of at least one chamber of Congress -- because her fiscal stimulus would be relatively small, especially compared to Trump’s plans for bigger tax cuts and more infrastructure spending. A Democratic sweep would likely result in more spending and drive yields higher. Municipal debt could gain under Clinton because any increased taxes she imposes on the wealthy would make tax-free bonds more attractive, BlackRock said. Trump Wins: In the two weeks after the U.K. gobsmacked pollsters and voted to leave the EU on June 23, the U.S. benchmark 10-year yield fell 39 basis points and didn’t return to pre-Brexit levels until September. Something akin to that may happen if Trump defies conventional wisdom. Credit Agricole SA predicts a “massive disjoint” that would send 10-year yields down at least 10 basis points if he prevails. Lyngen’s survey average predicted a smaller drop. After the dust settles, Trump’s tax cuts and infrastructure-spending plans may drive yields back up, especially if Republicans hold both the House and Senate. That impact could be exaggerated if the Republican’s isolationist foreign policy prompts countries with large Treasury stakes to unload them, Credit Agricole analysts said. Fiscal largess would also benefit inflation-linked bonds, which already are outperforming nominal securities this year. Yields would only remain flat under Trump, according to Bank of America, in the unlikeliest event of all: President Trump finds himself up against Democrats controlling both houses of Congress, because they would resist his massive tax cuts. Trump’s support for fossil fuels could spur a rebound for energy industry bonds, especially high-yield ones, after two years of major losses in the commodities slump, Wells Fargo & Co. said in a report. As for munis, “Trump’s plan to slash personal tax rates could deal a blow to the asset class,” BlackRock’s report said. Currencies Clinton Wins: The U.S. dollar would gain versus other developed-market currencies with the Democrat heading toward the White House as traders focus attention on the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in December, according to Capital Economics, a London research firm. Down the road, Bank of America sees the greenback gaining under Clinton only if the Democrats take Congress. Currencies from emerging markets have mostly priced in a Clinton win, which would be neutral or positive for all countries except Russia, Societe Generale SA said in a report. Mexico’s peso would benefit from a Clinton win more than any other emerging-market currency, Societe Generale said. It has acted as a barometer of the presidential contest, tending to move in tandem with her chances of defeating a candidate who promised to make the U.S.’s southern neighbor pay for a wall between the two countries. Look for China’s yuan to “strengthen modestly in response to a Clinton win as currencies sensitive to the outlook for global trade rally in relief,” said Sean Callow, senior strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney. Trump Wins: The foreign-exchange markets this week are suggesting what might happen if the Republican triumphs, with the dollar tumbling against most major currencies and the Mexican peso bucking the trend as one of the worst performers against the greenback. Societe Generale SA predicted that Mexico’s currency would weaken to as much as 23 pesos per dollar, from an average of just under 19 over the past three months. Even after the immediate shock of a Trump win, the U.S. dollar may weaken as developed-market currencies including the yen, euro, pound and franc rally on concern that China would dump U.S. assets and the Fed would delay tightening monetary policy. The greenback could then rally in a three- to nine-month horizon as Republicans usher in tax cuts and other fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth, Bank of America said. The candidate’s hostility toward China -- including threats of steep tariffs over alleged currency manipulation -- likely would drive the offshore yuan down about 3 percent by year’s end, said Ken Cheung, a foreign-exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Hong Kong. Longer term, the currency may fall more gradually under Trump as he exerts political pressure on the country’s leaders to slow its depreciation, said Xu Gao, an economist at Everbright Securities Co. in Beijing. Risk adversity in the aftermath of a Trump win would also hurt other developing-world currencies on fears that his protectionist stances could hurt emerging economies by reducing imports from them. That “could be negative for high-yielder countries,” Credit Agricole said in a report. The South Korean won may take a hit, given questions Trump has raised about the need for U.S. troops on the North Korean border. Commodity-linked currencies including the Canadian dollar "would lose ground," BMO said. If Republicans sweep, the euro might fall against the dollar, BMO said, because they would be inclined to open a foreign-earnings repatriation window for American companies to bring money back home, and "a high concentration of U.S.-based multinationals’ earnings are held" in Europe. Emerging Markets Clinton Wins: It’ll be risk-on if the Democrat retains control of the White House, which bodes well for developing markets. Investors may respond by bidding up Chinese defense shares because she comes across as the more hawkish candidate, said Francis Cheung, head of China and Hong Kong strategy at CLSA Ltd. Commodity producers in the developing world might rally on expectations that U.S. demand will increase along with infrastructure spending. Trump Wins: “I can’t think of any country that would benefit if Trump wins,” CMC Markets’ Yang said. Evercore’s report mentioned one nation that might get a boost, suggesting investors buy Russian equities to hedge against the Clinton-leaning polls being wrong. Citigroup sees the MSCI Emerging Markets Index immediately falling at least 10 percent, with Mexican stocks leading the way down. The Institute for International Finance explained why in a report on Thursday: “Nearly 80% of Mexico’s exports go to the U.S.” and “workers’ remittances are one of the three largest sources of foreign currency,” behind oil and tourism. One possible bright spot for Mexico: Construction companies such as Cemex SAB de CV may be positioned for contracts to build Trump’s proposed border wall. In Asia, “China will bear the brunt of risks if Trump wins,” said Ken Peng, an investment strategist at Citi Private Bank in Hong Kong, by phone. “He’ll probably introduce trade policies targeted against China,” weakening its economy. Protectionist U.S. policies also would be “bad for a lot of economies that rely a lot on exports,” said Ben Bei, an analyst at CIMB Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. Peng said exporters from South Korea and Taiwan are among those with the most to lose. Yang adds Southeast Asia exporters to the list, including companies in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. Citigroup called Latin America "most vulnerable" to U.S. protectionism. To the extent that Trump is less welcoming to workers from abroad, his victory may hurt the Philippines’ broader economy, which gets the bulk of its overseas remittances from Filipinos employed in the U.S., Yang said. “India and Indonesia will be least affected if Trump wins,” due to their robust domestic growth, Peng said. Commodities Clinton Wins: Her environmental policies, especially her promise to combat climate change, will put pressure on coal and oil. The natural gas market could get a boost from her pledge to wean power plants off coal by using gas as “a bridge” to more reliance on renewables. Trump Wins: Natural gas prices likely would suffer as coal benefits under Trump. He has promised to roll back environmental rules that squeeze coal out of the U.S. power market and promoted “clean coal” during one of the debates. Bloomberg Intelligence in September estimated that a victory by the Republican would shave 11 percent off natural gas demand in 2030 from last year’s levels, boosting coal use. Oil prices could get a lift from the return of a risk premium if Trump continues with the “bellicose language that’s been heard on the campaign trail” about Iran and scraps President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with the country, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York hedge fund focused on energy. Gold, platinum and silver would the “biggest winners” if Trump wins, said Yang, the CMC Markets analyst. Since the day before the FBI’s surprise announced that it will examine newly discovered e-mails relevant to its inquiry of Clinton’s use of a private Internet server as secretary of state, all precious metals are up, including a 3.9 jump percent in silver and a 2.6 percent advance in gold. Copper may also get a bounce, Barclays said, citing moves in the metal’s price during the campaign suggesting “a Trump-related premium in infrastructure-related assets given expectations around his fiscal plan.”   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.

The S&P 500 Index is on its longest losing streak since the 2008 financial crisis, shedding about 3 percent in eight days, or roughly the number of points Hillary Clinton’s lead has shrunk in that period. Since the Federal Bureau of Investigation reignited controversy over her e-mail practices on Oct. 28, haven assets are rising and riskier ones are falling, as shown by this chart: That’s in line with -- albeit less dramatic than -- what analysts have said will happen if the Republican wins, much like the aftermath of the U.K.’s June vote to leave the European Union. “In case of a Trump win, we envision a violent flight to quality,” Barclays Plc said in a report. A Democratic sweep may also be disruptive, though that’s an increasingly remote possibility. JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised a third potential surprise in a report that it said may produce a similar market reaction. The title said it all: “I demand a recount.” What Happens If Nobody Wins the Presidency: QuickTake Q&A The recent moves reflect worries that investors aren’t sure whether to believe reassurances from analysts including Morgan Stanley (Clinton “still favored”) and Citigroup Inc. (toss-up “overstates” Trump’s odds). Over the longer term, both candidates want to increase spending and cut taxes which would be bullish for stocks and bearish for fixed income. Below is a look at potential winners and losers. But first, a caveat. Investors’ immediate reaction to U.S. elections often doesn’t last, as shown by this chart: With that... Stocks Clinton Wins: “The market has already priced in a Clinton victory,” said Margaret Yang, a CMC Markets analyst in Singapore. “Any upside will be limited if she wins.” Barclays Plc said in a report this week that the S&P 500 Index could gain as much as 3 percent after a Clinton triumph. Beyond an initial “risk-relief rally on the prospect of policy continuity and predictability,” Deutsche Bank AG said that Clinton’s plans to limit the capital gains tax break may “have negative/dampening impact on some key risk bellwether assets like equities into the turn of the year.” The biggest losers would be finance and drug companies. “A potential Democratic sweep would represent one of the toughest election outcomes for banks,” Morgan Stanley said in a report, citing the risk of tougher rules and tax changes that might hurt companies like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Moves against carried-interest rules that benefit asset managers, also targeted by Trump, would hurt firms including Janus Capital Group Inc. and Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. Under Clinton, pharmaceutical and biotech stocks “could be hit by renewed pressure to curb price increases on drugs,” BlackRock Inc. researchers said in a report, noting her complaints about rising costs. Citigroup Inc. cut its rating on the European health-care industry to underweight in September, citing U.S. election risks. Drugmakers Novo Nordisk A/S and Roche Holding AG have trailed the broader market this year as Clinton’s prospects rose, with the shares gaining only during times when her polling numbers fell. Hospital operators and Medicaid providers such as HCA Holdings Inc. and Universal Health Services Inc. may benefit from continued Affordable Care Act subsidies, according to analysts from Strategas Research Partners, LPL Financial Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG. Her plans to reduce dependence on fossil fuels would boost alternative energy producers, with Morgan Stanley touting the prospects of Sunrun Inc. and NextEra Energy Inc. under Clinton. Strategas also likes First Solar Inc. in that scenario. Evercore ISI adds General Electric Co., Tesla Motors Inc., SolarCity Corp. and Exelon Corp. to the list in its pre-election report. A Democratic sweep increases the odds for a minimum wage hike, which cuts both ways for consumer stocks, Morgan Stanley said. Trump Wins: “Valuations of U.S. equities are quite high, and a Trump victory will trigger a massive selloff,” CMC’s Yang said. Many would consider that a classic “black swan event,” she added, so the reaction would be “much more severe” than Brexit, which caused the S&P 500 Index to fall 5.3 percent in two days as benchmarks in Europe and elsewhere lost even more. Investors seeking haven in the yen would be “a negative for Japanese exporters,” Yang said. Barclays predicted the S&P 500 may nosedive by between 11 percent and 13 percent if Trump wins. Citigroup equity strategist Tobias Levkovich put the hit at no more than 5 percent in a report Thursday. The Republican’s shifting policy positions make his longer-term impact on particular sectors harder to assess. BlackRock’s analysis of the correlation between the two candidate’s polling numbers and sector stock performance suggest drugmakers, insurers and banks are expected to do better under Trump. Bloomberg News did a similar analysis for individual U.S. stocks. Even some of these sectors, however, face Trump-related risks. He favors repealing Obamacare and allowing the importation of prescription drugs, which could hurt pharmaceutical companies, Morgan Stanley said. And finance companies may prefer Trump, but BlackRock warned that repealing the post-crisis Dodd-Frank law, derided by the industry’s Republican allies, may result in “simpler and blunter but equally onerous rules.” Companies that build and maintain civil infrastructure, such as Caterpillar Inc. and Ingersoll-Rand Corp., would have bigger opportunities for government work under Trump, given that his plans for such spending are much more ambitious than Clinton’s. The same holds true for military contractors, Credit Suisse said. Morgan Stanley sees NRG Energy Inc., which uses coal to produce electricity, benefiting under a Republican White House, due to less regulation and slower growth in the use of renewables. The bank said consumer stocks could be hurt by a Trump win because tougher immigration restrictions could crimp labor supply and consumer demand. Bonds Clinton Wins: A victory by the Democrat would initially drive up yields as investors sell off Treasuries in favor of riskier assets, Bank of America Corp. analysts said in a report. Ripple effects would raise borrowing costs for individuals and corporations worldwide because U.S. sovereigns are the global debt benchmark. Yields on 10-year U.S. bonds have risen as much as 36 basis points since Clinton’s lead over Trump started widening in late July, and the bank’s analysts called the Democratic Party’s improving prospects “a major factor” behind that move. They’ve fallen a bit since the FBI’s Oct. 28 announcement about the e-mails. Market participants surveyed by Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, predicted an average increase of 5 basis points if Clinton wins, he said Thursday. Over the longer term, a Clinton victory would do little to yields -- as long as Republicans retain control of at least one chamber of Congress -- because her fiscal stimulus would be relatively small, especially compared to Trump’s plans for bigger tax cuts and more infrastructure spending. A Democratic sweep would likely result in more spending and drive yields higher. Municipal debt could gain under Clinton because any increased taxes she imposes on the wealthy would make tax-free bonds more attractive, BlackRock said. Trump Wins: In the two weeks after the U.K. gobsmacked pollsters and voted to leave the EU on June 23, the U.S. benchmark 10-year yield fell 39 basis points and didn’t return to pre-Brexit levels until September. Something akin to that may happen if Trump defies conventional wisdom. Credit Agricole SA predicts a “massive disjoint” that would send 10-year yields down at least 10 basis points if he prevails. Lyngen’s survey average predicted a smaller drop. After the dust settles, Trump’s tax cuts and infrastructure-spending plans may drive yields back up, especially if Republicans hold both the House and Senate. That impact could be exaggerated if the Republican’s isolationist foreign policy prompts countries with large Treasury stakes to unload them, Credit Agricole analysts said. Fiscal largess would also benefit inflation-linked bonds, which already are outperforming nominal securities this year. Yields would only remain flat under Trump, according to Bank of America, in the unlikeliest event of all: President Trump finds himself up against Democrats controlling both houses of Congress, because they would resist his massive tax cuts. Trump’s support for fossil fuels could spur a rebound for energy industry bonds, especially high-yield ones, after two years of major losses in the commodities slump, Wells Fargo & Co. said in a report. As for munis, “Trump’s plan to slash personal tax rates could deal a blow to the asset class,” BlackRock’s report said. Currencies Clinton Wins: The U.S. dollar would gain versus other developed-market currencies with the Democrat heading toward the White House as traders focus attention on the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in December, according to Capital Economics, a London research firm. Down the road, Bank of America sees the greenback gaining under Clinton only if the Democrats take Congress. Currencies from emerging markets have mostly priced in a Clinton win, which would be neutral or positive for all countries except Russia, Societe Generale SA said in a report. Mexico’s peso would benefit from a Clinton win more than any other emerging-market currency, Societe Generale said. It has acted as a barometer of the presidential contest, tending to move in tandem with her chances of defeating a candidate who promised to make the U.S.’s southern neighbor pay for a wall between the two countries. Look for China’s yuan to “strengthen modestly in response to a Clinton win as currencies sensitive to the outlook for global trade rally in relief,” said Sean Callow, senior strategist at Westpac Banking Corp. in Sydney. Trump Wins: The foreign-exchange markets this week are suggesting what might happen if the Republican triumphs, with the dollar tumbling against most major currencies and the Mexican peso bucking the trend as one of the worst performers against the greenback. Societe Generale SA predicted that Mexico’s currency would weaken to as much as 23 pesos per dollar, from an average of just under 19 over the past three months. Even after the immediate shock of a Trump win, the U.S. dollar may weaken as developed-market currencies including the yen, euro, pound and franc rally on concern that China would dump U.S. assets and the Fed would delay tightening monetary policy. The greenback could then rally in a three- to nine-month horizon as Republicans usher in tax cuts and other fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth, Bank of America said. The candidate’s hostility toward China -- including threats of steep tariffs over alleged currency manipulation -- likely would drive the offshore yuan down about 3 percent by year’s end, said Ken Cheung, a foreign-exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Hong Kong. Longer term, the currency may fall more gradually under Trump as he exerts political pressure on the country’s leaders to slow its depreciation, said Xu Gao, an economist at Everbright Securities Co. in Beijing. Risk adversity in the aftermath of a Trump win would also hurt other developing-world currencies on fears that his protectionist stances could hurt emerging economies by reducing imports from them. That “could be negative for high-yielder countries,” Credit Agricole said in a report. The South Korean won may take a hit, given questions Trump has raised about the need for U.S. troops on the North Korean border. Commodity-linked currencies including the Canadian dollar "would lose ground," BMO said. If Republicans sweep, the euro might fall against the dollar, BMO said, because they would be inclined to open a foreign-earnings repatriation window for American companies to bring money back home, and "a high concentration of U.S.-based multinationals’ earnings are held" in Europe. Emerging Markets Clinton Wins: It’ll be risk-on if the Democrat retains control of the White House, which bodes well for developing markets. Investors may respond by bidding up Chinese defense shares because she comes across as the more hawkish candidate, said Francis Cheung, head of China and Hong Kong strategy at CLSA Ltd. Commodity producers in the developing world might rally on expectations that U.S. demand will increase along with infrastructure spending. Trump Wins: “I can’t think of any country that would benefit if Trump wins,” CMC Markets’ Yang said. Evercore’s report mentioned one nation that might get a boost, suggesting investors buy Russian equities to hedge against the Clinton-leaning polls being wrong. Citigroup sees the MSCI Emerging Markets Index immediately falling at least 10 percent, with Mexican stocks leading the way down. The Institute for International Finance explained why in a report on Thursday: “Nearly 80% of Mexico’s exports go to the U.S.” and “workers’ remittances are one of the three largest sources of foreign currency,” behind oil and tourism. One possible bright spot for Mexico: Construction companies such as Cemex SAB de CV may be positioned for contracts to build Trump’s proposed border wall. In Asia, “China will bear the brunt of risks if Trump wins,” said Ken Peng, an investment strategist at Citi Private Bank in Hong Kong, by phone. “He’ll probably introduce trade policies targeted against China,” weakening its economy. Protectionist U.S. policies also would be “bad for a lot of economies that rely a lot on exports,” said Ben Bei, an analyst at CIMB Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. Peng said exporters from South Korea and Taiwan are among those with the most to lose. Yang adds Southeast Asia exporters to the list, including companies in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. Citigroup called Latin America "most vulnerable" to U.S. protectionism. To the extent that Trump is less welcoming to workers from abroad, his victory may hurt the Philippines’ broader economy, which gets the bulk of its overseas remittances from Filipinos employed in the U.S., Yang said. “India and Indonesia will be least affected if Trump wins,” due to their robust domestic growth, Peng said. Commodities Clinton Wins: Her environmental policies, especially her promise to combat climate change, will put pressure on coal and oil. The natural gas market could get a boost from her pledge to wean power plants off coal by using gas as “a bridge” to more reliance on renewables. Trump Wins: Natural gas prices likely would suffer as coal benefits under Trump. He has promised to roll back environmental rules that squeeze coal out of the U.S. power market and promoted “clean coal” during one of the debates. Bloomberg Intelligence in September estimated that a victory by the Republican would shave 11 percent off natural gas demand in 2030 from last year’s levels, boosting coal use. Oil prices could get a lift from the return of a risk premium if Trump continues with the “bellicose language that’s been heard on the campaign trail” about Iran and scraps President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with the country, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York hedge fund focused on energy. Gold, platinum and silver would the “biggest winners” if Trump wins, said Yang, the CMC Markets analyst. Since the day before the FBI’s surprise announced that it will examine newly discovered e-mails relevant to its inquiry of Clinton’s use of a private Internet server as secretary of state, all precious metals are up, including a 3.9 jump percent in silver and a 2.6 percent advance in gold. Copper may also get a bounce, Barclays said, citing moves in the metal’s price during the campaign suggesting “a Trump-related premium in infrastructure-related assets given expectations around his fiscal plan.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

How High-Tech Banks Are Fighting Back Against Patent Trolls By Brian Patrick Eha November 4, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Related  Enlarge This Image Related B of A's Bessant on AI, Blockchain, Patents and Swift Fintech Patent Trolls Can't Be Allowed to Win What's Behind the Huge Increase in Bank Patent Filings?  Enlarge This Image "If you want to pursue banking 3.0 technologies, there's a high probability you're going to be running" into patent trolls, said TD Bank's Josh Death. How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue In the old fairy tale, there is a troll who lives under a bridge and eats everybody who tries to get across. In the real world today, there are trolls that lurk in the underbelly of the innovation economy and exact a pound of flesh from legitimate companies. Because their weapon of choice is intellectual property, in the form of patents, they have preyed for years on technology companies, the Googles and Apples of the world, costing them billions of dollars. But now top banks, like the leading firms in so many industries, are becoming technology companies in their own right. That makes them newly vulnerable to the depredations of these corporate bullies, popularly known as patent trolls. It also means they need new protections. One organization that has made itself a bulwark against patent trolls is the LOT Network, a nonprofit consortium of companies that have mutually agreed to grant their fellow members a free license to any of their patents, should those patents fall into the hands of a troll. In other words, LOT members—a club that includes top technology firms and financial institutions—immunize each other from the threat of being sued. Between them, they hold more than 585,000 patents. Joining the network, then, is equivalent to getting vaccinated against more than half a million diseases all at once. The consortium was founded in 2014 by Google, Canon and the multinational software companies Red Hat and SAP. Among top American banks, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are members, and last week, TD Bank Group became the latest financial institution to join. This move arose from the Toronto company's realization that patent trolls were a growing threat to its future. The $900 billion-asset TD has made such a huge commitment to digital banking that it now has the largest finance-focused patent portfolio in all of Canada, according to Josh Death, its associate vice president of legal. "While our core products aren't changing—a mortgage is a mortgage is a mortgage—we're leveraging technology more and more," Death said. "The new customer is transitioning to a very digital environment, and we want to be there in a position to service them." The LOT Network has nearly 100 members, and more than 10% of them are financial institutions or fintech startup, said Ken Seddon, the consortium's chief executive. "Just as the automobile industry is effectively turning the car into a smartphone on wheels," he said, "banks are incorporating tons of technology from outside their industry. And when you do that, you're basically chumming the waters for patent trolls." Know Thy Enemy The official term for patent trolls is "nonpracticing entities," so called because they don't create anything, don't provide any product or service, but instead make money entirely from suing productive businesses. Another term is "patent-assertion entities," reflecting the fact that they don't use their portfolios of patents for commercial purposes, the way banks and software firms do. They merely assert them against other companies, even when their claim of infringement is shaky at best. While the goal of such litigation is always the same—to get a payday—patent trolls use various strategies in their shakedowns. One is what Death calls the "smash-and-grab," in which the infringement claim is dubious but the cost of defending the litigation far outweighs the cost of a small settlement. Another is the "lottery win." In this strategy, the nonpracticing entity does significant due diligence in order to build a strong case, and is prepared to take it all the way in order to score "massive dollars," Death says. Beginning in 2006, "there was a tremendous explosion in patent suits," and things never returned to the status quo ante, said Eric Schulman, who drafted the original LOT agreement as a legal director at Google and now serves on the consortium's advisory board. Today, 70% of all patent litigation is brought by patent trolls. Google, Schulman's former employer, has long been one of the biggest targets. At one point, he said, the Silicon Valley giant found itself fighting 100 active patent suits simultaneously. Big banks are also in the crosshairs. In the past eight years, JPMorgan has been hit with lawsuits involving 104 different patents, according to Seddon. For most banks this is a new phenomenon. Several years ago, before mobile apps and remote account opening, banks were mostly brick-and-mortar operations—as unappetizing to patent trolls as lamb to a vegan. That is no longer the case. The more innovation labs banks open, the more fintech partnerships they forge, the plumper and juicier they become in the eyes of trolls. And the trolls' appetites are not to be taken lightly. The average lawsuit brought by one, if it goes to trial, costs the defending company about $3 million in legal fees alone. The problem looks even more serious on a national scale. A study by James Bessen and Michael Meurer of Boston University School of Law found that in 2011, American companies were forced to shell out $29 billion in litigation and settlement costs as a result of patent-troll litigation. That expenditure amounts to an enormous tax on innovation, experts say. « 1  |  2  |  3 »     view entire article Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints JOIN THE DISCUSSION Comment SEE MORE IN Bank Technology RELATED TAGS National/Regional, Comments (0) Be the first to comment on this post using the section below.

The series 2011B variable rate demand bonds (VRDB) are supported by a letter of credit (LOC) from JPMorgan Chase. The Rating Outlook is stable. SECURITY Debt payments are secured by a pledge of the accounts and general intangibles of the obligated group. The obligated group includes Munson Healthcare, Munson Medical Center (MMC), Paul Oliver Memorial Hospital, Munson Healthcare Grayling, Munson Healthcare Cadillac, Munson Healthcare Charlevoix, Munson Home Health, Munson Home Care, Munson Home Services, North Flight, Inc., and Munson Healthcare Regional Foundation. The obligated group accounted for 98% of total assets and 97% of system operating revenue in fiscal 2016. KEY RATING DRIVERS DISTINCTLY LEADING MARKET POSITION: Munson maintains a distinctly leading market position over a broad service area, with very limited direct acute care competition. GOOD LIQUIDITY: Munson's liquidity metrics are strong, including cash-to-debt of over 260% at fiscal year-end 2016. TRACK-RECORD OF OPERATING PROFITABILITY: Munson has a track-record of profitability (4.3% operating margin in fiscal 2016), although its operating EBITDA margin (9.5% in fiscal 2016) lags the category median. LIGHT DEBT BURDEN: Munson's debt burden is light with maximum annual debt service (MADS) equal to 1.3% of fiscal 2016 revenue. Based on the system's adequate cash flow generation, debt ratios are in-line with category medians. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN: Munson has a defined benefit pension plan that was frozen to new entrants in 2005. The plan had a 67% funded ratio at fiscal year-end 2016 (approximately $148 million underfunded). RATING SENSITIVITIES MAINTAIN PERFORMANCE: Fitch expects Munson Healthcare to maintain adequate operating margins to continue to generate good debt service coverage. Maintenance of strong liquidity is expected. Also, Fitch does not anticipate any material threat to Munson Healthcare's very strong market position. CREDIT PROFILE Headquartered in Traverse City, MI, Munson consists of MMC, a major tertiary referral hospital with 391 beds, seven owned or affiliated hospitals, outpatient facilities, and home based medical services. Total operating revenue measured over $840 million in fiscal 2016. During calendar year 2015, Munson acquired three hospitals that it previously had managed: Munson Healthcare Cadillac Hospital and Munson Healthcare Grayling Hospital (from 'AA' rated Trinity Health Credit Group) in February 2015; and Charlevoix Area Hospital in December 2015. While the acquisitions are somewhat dilutive to Munson's operating margins, and contributed to softer results in fiscal 2016, management has identified operating improvements at the newly acquired affiliates to drive system-wide margin improvement. DISTINCTLY LEADING MARKET POSITION Munson maintains a distinctly leading market position over a broad service area, which is a key credit positive for the system. Munson's primary service area (PSA) covers five counties, centered around Grand Traverse County. Munson maintains a PSA inpatient market share of approximately 75%. Of Grand Traverse County, the economic hub of the northern portion of the lower peninsula of Michigan, Munson maintains 90%-plus market share. Demographic characteristics in Grand Traverse County are favorable. Based on U.S. Census Bureau of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data, the population growth rate in the county is greater than the national average and well ahead of state average, the median household income is above state average and just below national average, the poverty rate is well below average, and the unemployment rate is well below average. GOOD LIQUIDITY Munson's liquidity metrics are good. At fiscal year-end 2016 (June 30 year-end), cash-to-debt of 266% and the cushion ratio of 46% were well in excess of the 'AA' medians of 198% and 30%, respectively. Cash on hand measured an adequate 237 days ('AA' median is 277 days). Munson maintains a comparatively conservative investment allocation, particularly considering its modest debt load. Cash and investments are allocated essentially entirely to cash, fixed income, and equities, with only a small allocation to international equities. The portfolio is very liquid, with no exposure to hedge funds or private equity. TRACK-RECORD OF OPERATING PROFITABILITY Favorably, Munson has a track-record of profitability (4.3% operating margin in fiscal 2016), although its operating EBITDA margin (9.5% in fiscal 2016) lags the category median (11.7%). (Fiscal 2016 operating margins do not include a $20 million one-time gain due to the termination of the retiree health benefit plan). Margins moderated in fiscal 2016, after the system recorded an adjusted 5.8% operating margin and 11.4% operating EBITDA margin in fiscal 2015 (adjusted to remove $4 million rural floor settlement funding). The primary drivers for the softer margins in fiscal 2016 include: (a) adding Cadillac and Grayling were dilutive to the system's results; and (b) Munson experienced some nursing shortages, particularly among OR staff, which lead to an increased use of agency nurses and a greater than inflationary wage increase. Also as a result of the Cadillac and Grayling acquisitions, Munson received an increase in provider tax net funding, from $4.9 million in fiscal 2014 to $8.7 million in fiscal 2015 to $16.8 million in fiscal 2016. Munson receives approximately $25 million of Medicare sole community provider funding. While the cash flow received from these supplemental funding sources is a positive to Munson, any material cuts to these programs would require Munson to make commensurate expense reductions. Looking forward, Munson is budgeting margins for fiscal 2017 in-line with fiscal 2016, with a budgeted 4.4% operating margin and 9.7% operating EBITDA margin. Management is planning to generate improvements at its recently acquired hospitals. LIGHT DEBT BURDEN Another credit positive for Munson is its comparatively modest debt burden. MADS as a measured 1.3% of fiscal 2016 revenue ('AA' median is 2.2%). Consequently, based on the system's adequate cash flow generation, debt ratios are in-line with category medians. In fiscal 2016, MADS coverage from EBITDA measured 5.7x ('AA' median is 6.0x) and debt-to-capitalization 26% ('AA' median is 28%). At fiscal year-end 2016, Munson's debt portfolio was 87% fixed rate and 13% variable rate. The variable rate debt consists of the series 2011B VRDBs, which are supported by an LOC from JPMorgan Chase (which expires in August 2019). Financial covenants in Munson's bond documents include: minimum debt service coverage of 1.35x; if the debt service coverage ratio is less than 2.25x and there is no funded debt service reserve fund, then Munson must maintain a cushion ratio of at least 2.0x; minimum cash on hand of 75 days (consultant call-in) and 45 days (event of default); and an additional indebtedness test with a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.20x. Munson's favorable debt ratios are diluted somewhat by the system's defined benefit pension plan. The plan was frozen to new entrants in 2005. The plan was approximately $148 million underfunded at fiscal year-end 2016, translating to a 67% funded ratio. Munson's capital spending plans are manageable in the coming years. Between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2021, the system has approximately $285 million of capital plans. Most recently, Munson opened its new cancer center on the MMC campus (in a clinical relationship with UM Health). Moving forward, capital spending will focus on information technology, ambulatory development, and replacing and expanding the NICU and ORs at MMC. In 2018 or 2019, Munson is considering adding approximately $30 million of new money debt. DISCLOSURE Munson covenants to provide annual and quarterly disclosure which it posts to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board's EMMA system.

Thanks for checking out our new design, please let us know if you have feedback SFist is a website about San Francisco View Pretty | Blog Arts & Entertainment Food News Popular Advertising Contact Newsletter RSS Feed Staff Our Cities Chicago London Los Angeles New York City San Francisco Shanghai Toronto Washington DC Sunday's 'Extra' Hour Of Sleep Cold Comfort To Those Who Despise Daylight Saving Time by Eve Batey in News on Nov 4, 2016 11:05 am Even Father Time wonders WTF we're still doing messing with DST in this day and age. Screencap: SKY TV It might be easier to stomach the August fizzle of a bill intended to kill off Daylight Saving Time in California given the extra hour of sleep the annual shift back to Standard Time will net you this Sunday, but that doesn't mean complaints from DST opponents have been quelled. As happens every year, at 2 a.m. Sunday clocks will "fall back," giving us all an extra hour in the early morning to do with what we will. (I choose "sleeping," but you guys are way more fun than me and probably have better ideas.) As the SFMTA cutely notes, (sic throughout) "While most smart phones will make the time adjustment automatically, don’t forget to wind those watches and clocks back one-hour." Yes, indeed, wind those things thataway! The change in time is also a cue for various publications to pen crabbypieces on why changing time is bad. My favorite this year comes from WDEF-TV 12, which "provides local programming as well as network programs from CBS to residents of Chattanooga and the Tennessee Valley." According to the station, "many Americans" will be "grumbling on Monday when they leave work and find full-on darkness awaiting," but they'll be more upset to learn that the time change is "not healthy for the economy." According to WDEF, a report from JPMorgan Chase Institute says that “There is a perception that DST increases spending among those consumers who make use of the extra daylight to frequent shops and restaurants, or spend money on outdoor recreation and other activities...Our unprecedented view of spending around the beginning and end of DST does not support consumer spending claims of DST advocates.” Basically, the report claims, people who find it dark when they leave work would rather head home than shop or dine out, which means businesses aren't seeing spending from these nightfall fearing consumers. Quartz also argues that "Fewer muggings and sexual assaults occur during DST months because fewer potential victims are out after dark," which not only seems to support JPMorgan's arguments regarding decreased nighttime activity, but suggests that those non-spending consumers have the right idea when they hustle home. Regardless of these arguments, California will continue to be a time-changing state, as opposition in the state Senate kept a bill letting voters choose DST's fate off next week's ballot. One of the proposal's most vocal opponents? Terming-out senator San Francisco Mark Leno, who objected that "there's some real unintended consequences" if CA voters agreed to pick one time and stick with it. For example, for half the year we'd be four hours behind the East Coast instead of three, a time difference that could make life well nigh insufferable for people with bosses back east. Not mentioned, but the first thing I wondered: Would the bill have meant that we'd get network broadcasts of TV shows "early" or "late"? I guess we'll never know, as San Jose Assemblyman Kansen Chu, who proposed the measure, hasn't indicated any interest in resuming the fight. Guess I'll see you back here on March 12, 2017, when DST resumes!

Think about your reward potential before you choose which card to use. Matthew Frankel (TMFMathGuy) Nov 4, 2016 at 7:23AM Image Source: Getty Images. When you go to the gas station, what's the best credit card to use? How about when you stay at a hotel? Even if all of your credit cards have reward programs, you may be surprised at the long-term difference using the right credit cards for the right purchases can make. Let's go over some of the big benefits of using the right card and one way to make the decision much easier. Different credit cards make sense for different purchases As an example, consider the four credit cards that are sitting in my wallet as I write this: Capital One Venture Rewards -- 2% back on all purchases American Express Delta SkyMiles Platinum -- One mile per dollar on all purchases, two miles per dollar on Delta purchases. Chase Freedom -- 1% back on most purchases, 5% back in rotating categories. Currently, the 5% cash back categories are department stores, wholesale clubs, and drug stores. American Express Starwood Preferred Guest Card -- One Starpoint per dollar on general purchases, two Starpoints per dollar at SPG hotels, and three if you have elite status. In this case, my go-to credit card is the Capital One, as it has the best general rewards rate. However, when I travel, it's a much better deal to charge my airline and hotel purchases on the two Amex cards, as the value of Delta Sky Miles and SPG Starpoints are significantly more than one cent apiece. Additionally, when I do my every-few-weeks trip to Costco, it makes the most sense to put the purchases on my Chase Freedom. It can be difficult to keep track The problem many people run into is keeping track of which card is best to use for which type of purchase at any given time. This can be especially difficult if your cards have rotating reward categories. One solution that may work for you is an app from Wallaby Financial, a subsidiary of Bankrate (NYSE: RATE). Not only does the app keep track of your reward rates, but it also takes other factors into account, such as interest-rate differences and fees, in order to tell you the best card to use at any time. Wallaby can also tell you the best card to use at individual retailers, or when you're shopping online. Image Source: Wallaby Financial. The company maintains a database of about 3,200 credit cards from 600 financial institutions, so all of your credit cards are most likely compatible. Over time, the app can even tell you how many rewards you've accumulated and how much you've missed out on by using the wrong card. In addition, the app monitors your linked credit card accounts for suspicious activity and fee increases. In other words, it's intended to help you keep track of all of your credit card accounts in one place. In addition, Wallaby can also analyze your actual spending data and suggest the best card to get next based on your estimated reward potential. Look at the big picture as well When selecting a credit card, rewards are important, but it's important to mention that they are just one piece of the puzzle. According to Matthew Goldman, founder and CEO of Wallaby, there are three main things to look for when selecting a new credit card: Reward potential. This is what we've been talking about, and it's important to keep in mind that your spending habits (and therefore your ideal rewards cards) can change over time. "For example, if you have a child, you may start spending more money on groceries, so it might be a good idea to get a credit card that rewards grocery spending," says Goldman. Fees. This category includes any annual fees and interest charges. Annual fees can be well worth it if the perks and rewards of the card justify them. And interest rates can vary significantly among credit cards, even for someone with an excellent credit rating. Amenities value. In addition to rewards, many credit cards offer additional perks. For example, the American Express Delta Platinum Sky Miles card offers free checked bags, which saves me $50 per round-trip flight, as well as a companion certificate each year (essentially a "buy one, get one free" airline ticket). These benefits alone more than justify the $195 annual fee I pay. Maximizing rewards only makes sense if... As a final thought, playing the credit card rewards game only makes sense if you're smart about your card usage. Carrying large credit card balances for the sole purpose of getting rewards is a bad financial decision. In a matter of a month or two, the interest charges you accumulate can easily add up to more than the value of your rewards. In other words, the No. 1 way to maximize your credit card rewards is to pay off your charges as soon as possible and avoid carrying balances. That's the best way to actually make money from your credit cards. Matthew Frankel owns shares of American Express. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Costco Wholesale.

Markets Boosted by "Trump rally," Dow hits new record By Aimee Picchi MoneyWatch November 4, 2016, 5:30 AM Daylight saving time isn’t sunny for the economy Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email The end of daylight saving time may leave many Americans grumbling on Monday when they leave work and find full-on darkness awaiting. Yet there’s another reason to grumble: It’s not healthy for the economy. Daylight saving time, which starts in the spring when America pushes forward its clocks by one hour, will end this Sunday, Nov. 6, when those clocks turn back an hour. The time change was created in World War I as a way to save energy by providing more hours of daylight in spring and summer evenings. (Farmers, contrary to widespread belief, didn’t support the measure because it meant they lost an hour of morning light.)  Aside from little proof that DST helps conserve energy, new research is shedding light on how consumers react to the time shifts, and it’s not a sunny picture. The time change has a net negative impact on consumer spending, according to an analysis of more than 380 million transactions by the JPMorgan Chase Institute, undercutting the belief that the extra hour of evening sunlight in the spring and summer is an economic boon.

The proposal cleared another state senate committee last week. CBSN's Elaine... “There is a perception that DST increases spending among those consumers who make use of the extra daylight to frequent shops and restaurants, or spend money on outdoor recreation and other activities,” the report said. “Our unprecedented view of spending around the beginning and end of DST does not support consumer spending claims of DST advocates.” It added, “Most of the impact stems from responses at the end of DST, when spending on goods drops more than spending on services, and spending during the work week drops more than weekend spending.” In other words, when the clock rolls back in November, Americans cut back on their spending, especially during the work week when employees find it’s already dark when they clock out of work. Some may take it as a signal to head home, rather than shop or meet friends for dinner. The study examined spending in two cities, Los Angeles and Phoenix. Because Arizona doesn’t observe DST, the researchers examined consumer spending in Phoenix as the comparison with spending behavior in Los Angeles, where residents jump forward an hour in the spring and fall back an hour in the autumn. Play Video CBSN Heart attack risk rises during Daylight Saving Time switch A recent study shows that setting the clocks ahead by an hour increases the risk of heart attacks. When clocks roll forward in the spring, consumers in Los Angeles spend 0.9 percent more on daily credit card spending per capita. While that seems like a positive, those gains are wiped out when DST ends in November, the study found. The fall roll-back coincides with a 3.5 percent decline in per capita daily card spending among Los Angelenos, the study found. Overall, it’s a net negative. “In our data, over two-thirds of the decline is due to a reduction in the number of transactions, which is consistent with the idea that daylight affects the decision to go to the store,” the study noted. Some spending categories are worse-hit than others, JPMorgan found. Grocery stores feel the biggest bite, with a decline of 6 percent in daily per capita spending when DST ends. Fuel and discount stores lose more than 4.5 percent, while restaurants, personal and professional services and health care see smaller declines. The impact of DST varies by city. JPMorgan noted that consumers in Denver spent 0.8 percent more at the start of DST and cut back by 4.9 percent in the fall, while consumers in San Diego spent only 2.2 percent less when daylight saving time ended. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc..

With traders worried that expectations for a status quo outcome -- Democrat in the White House kept in check by Republicans in Congress -- could be upended, the S&P 500 index fell for the ninth straight session, its longest losing streak since a few weeks after Ronald Reagan’s 1980 election. Clinton’s lead has plunged since the Federal Bureau of Investigation reignited controversy over her e-mail practices on Oct. 28, driving haven assets up and riskier ones down, as shown by this chart: On Friday, almost all of those assets became more hedged against a Trump win even as Clinton’s edge increased for the first time in a week, albeit by less than half a percentage point. The exceptions were the Japanese yen, a traditional safe harbor, and Mexico’s peso, with the former falling a bit from the day before and the latter rising 0.8 percent. The week’s trend away from riskier investments is in line with -- though less dramatic than -- what analysts predict if the Republican prevails, much like the aftermath of the U.K.’s June vote to leave the European Union. “In case of a Trump win, we envision a violent flight to quality,” Barclays Plc said in a report. A Democratic sweep may also be disruptive, but that possibility is increasingly remote. JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised a third potential surprise in a report that it said would produce a similar market reaction. The title: “I demand a recount.” What Happens If Nobody Wins the Presidency: QuickTake Q&A The recent moves reflect worries that investors aren’t sure whether to believe reassurances from analysts at Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc. and elsewhere that Clinton remains more likely to win. Options bets on where the S&P 500 Index will be the day after the election suggest the Democrat has a 63 percent chance of winning, less than what’s indicated by prediction markets and polling-aggregator forecasts, Janus Capital Group Inc. said in an e-mail on Saturday. Over the longer term, both candidates want to increase spending and cut taxes, which would be bullish for stocks and bearish for fixed income. Below is a look at potential winners and losers. But first, a caveat. Investors’ immediate reaction to U.S. elections often doesn’t last, as shown by this chart: With that... Stocks Clinton Wins: “The market has already priced in a Clinton victory,” said Margaret Yang, a CMC Markets analyst in Singapore. “Any upside will be limited if she wins.” Barclays Plc said in a report that the S&P 500 Index could gain as much as 3 percent. Beyond an initial “risk-relief rally on the prospect of policy continuity and predictability,” Deutsche Bank AG said that Clinton’s plans to limit the capital gains tax break may “have negative/dampening impact on some key risk bellwether assets like equities into the turn of the year.” The biggest losers would be finance and drug companies. “A potential Democratic sweep would represent one of the toughest election outcomes for banks,” Morgan Stanley said in a report, citing the risk of tougher rules and tax changes that might hurt companies like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan. Moves against carried-interest rules that benefit asset managers, also targeted by Trump, would hurt firms including Janus Capital Group Inc. and Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. Under Clinton, pharmaceutical and biotech stocks “could be hit by renewed pressure to curb price increases on drugs,” BlackRock Inc. researchers said in a report, noting her complaints about rising costs. Citigroup Inc. cut its rating on the European health-care industry to underweight in September, citing U.S. election risks. Drugmakers Novo Nordisk A/S and Roche Holding AG have trailed the broader market this year as Clinton’s prospects rose, with the shares gaining only during times when her polling numbers fell. Hospital operators and Medicaid providers such as HCA Holdings Inc. and Universal Health Services Inc. may benefit from continued Affordable Care Act subsidies, according to analysts from Strategas Research Partners, LPL Financial Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG. Her plans to reduce dependence on fossil fuels would boost alternative energy producers, with Morgan Stanley touting the prospects of Sunrun Inc. and NextEra Energy Inc. under Clinton. Strategas also likes First Solar Inc. in that scenario. Evercore ISI adds General Electric Co., Tesla Motors Inc., SolarCity Corp. and Exelon Corp. to the list in its pre-election report. A Democratic sweep increases the odds for a minimum wage hike, which cuts both ways for consumer stocks, Morgan Stanley said. Trump Wins: “Valuations of U.S. equities are quite high, and a Trump victory will trigger a massive selloff,” CMC’s Yang said. Many would consider that a classic “black swan event,” she added, so the reaction would be “much more severe” than Brexit, which caused the S&P 500 Index to fall 5.3 percent in two days as benchmarks in Europe and elsewhere lost even more. Barclays predicted an S&P 500 nosedive of as much as 13 percent if Trump wins. Citigroup equity strategist Tobias Levkovich put the hit at no more than 5 percent in a report. Judging the Republican’s longer-term impact is difficult to assess because “some of Trump’s policy proposals are so unconventional (trade, immigration) and others so vague (fiscal),” said John Normand, JPMorgan’s head of foreign exchange, commodities and international rates research, in a report on Friday. BlackRock’s analysis of the correlation between the two candidate’s polling numbers and sector stock performance suggest drugmakers, insurers and banks are expected to do better under Trump. Bloomberg News did a similar analysis for individual U.S. stocks. Even some of these sectors, however, face Trump-related risks. He favors repealing Obamacare and allowing the importation of prescription drugs, which could hurt pharmaceutical companies, Morgan Stanley said. And finance companies may prefer Trump, but BlackRock warned that repealing the post-crisis Dodd-Frank law, derided by the industry’s Republican allies, may result in “simpler and blunter but equally onerous rules.” Companies that build and maintain civil infrastructure, such as Caterpillar Inc. and Ingersoll-Rand Corp., would have bigger opportunities for government work under Trump, given that his plans for such spending are much more ambitious than Clinton’s. The same holds true for military contractors, Credit Suisse said. Morgan Stanley sees NRG Energy Inc., which uses coal to produce electricity, benefiting under a Republican White House, due to less regulation and slower growth in the use of renewables. The bank said consumer stocks could be hurt by a Trump win because tougher immigration restrictions could crimp labor supply and consumer demand. The Japanese stock market may get hit harder than others, falling as much as 10 percent due to the yen strengthening, Citigroup said Friday in a report. “There could be investment opportunities in infrastructure names and military-related stocks in any subsequent correction,” the report said, citing Hitachi Ltd., Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., among others. Bonds Clinton Wins: A victory by the Democrat would initially drive up yields as investors sell off Treasuries in favor of riskier assets, Bank of America Corp. analysts said in a report. Ripple effects would raise borrowing costs for individuals and corporations worldwide because U.S. sovereigns are the global debt benchmark. Yields on 10-year U.S. bonds have risen as much as 36 basis points since Clinton’s lead over Trump started widening in late July, and the bank’s analysts called the Democratic Party’s improving prospects “a major factor” behind that move. They’ve fallen a bit since the Oct. 28 announcement that the FBI would examine more Clinton-related e-mails. Market participants surveyed by Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, predicted an average increase of 5 basis points if Clinton wins, he said. Normand sees a much smaller reaction, titling the Clinton section of his report “next to nothing changes.” Over the longer term, a Clinton victory would do little to yields -- as long as Republicans retain control of at least one chamber of Congress -- because her fiscal stimulus would be relatively small, especially compared to Trump’s plans for bigger tax cuts and more infrastructure spending. A Democratic sweep would likely result in more spending and may drive yields higher. Municipal debt could gain under Clinton because any increased taxes she imposes on the wealthy would make tax-free bonds more attractive, BlackRock said. Trump Wins: In the two weeks after the U.K. gobsmacked pollsters and voted to leave the EU on June 23, the U.S. benchmark 10-year yield fell 39 basis points and didn’t return to pre-Brexit levels until September. Something akin to that may happen if Trump defies conventional wisdom. Credit Agricole SA predicts a “massive disjoint” that would send 10-year yields down at least 10 basis points if he prevails. Lyngen’s survey average predicted a smaller drop. JPMorgan’s Normand said the yield would fall below 1.7 percent in the days after a Trump win, from 1.78 percent on Friday. After the dust settles, Trump’s tax cuts and infrastructure-spending plans may drive yields back up, especially if Republicans hold both the House and Senate. That impact could be exaggerated if the Republican’s isolationist foreign policy prompts countries with large Treasury stakes to unload them, Credit Agricole analysts said. Fiscal largess would also benefit inflation-linked bonds, which already are outperforming nominal securities this year. Yields would only remain flat under Trump, according to Bank of America, in the unlikeliest event of all: President Trump finds himself up against Democrats controlling both houses of Congress, because they would resist his massive tax cuts. Trump’s support for fossil fuels could spur a rebound for energy industry bonds, especially high-yield ones, after two years of major losses in the commodities slump, Wells Fargo & Co. said in a report. As for munis, “Trump’s plan to slash personal tax rates could deal a blow to the asset class,” BlackRock’s report said. Currencies Clinton Wins: The U.S. dollar would gain versus other developed-market currencies, with the Democrat heading toward the White House as traders focus attention on the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in December, according to Capital Economics, a London research firm. Down the road, Bank of America sees the greenback gaining under Clinton only if the Democrats take Congress. Emerging-market currencies would see “modest and transitory” gains because a Clinton win “is mostly -- but not fully -- priced in,” though Russia may be an exception, Societe Generale SA said in a report. Mexico’s peso would benefit the most, the report said. It has acted as a barometer of the presidential contest, moving in tandem with her chances of defeating a candidate who wants to revamp trade deals, restrict immigration and make the U.S.’s southern neighbor pay for a border wall. If Clinton triumphs, the peso would strengthen to 18.25 per dollar, a 4.3 percent gain from Friday, and the Canadian dollar would also rise, though not quite as much, Normand of JPMorgan said. Elsewhere, most Asian currencies would rally 2 percent or so in relief, said Cliff Tan, a strategist in Hong Kong for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. Trump Wins: The foreign-exchange markets this week are suggesting what might happen if the Republican triumphs, with the dollar tumbling against most major currencies and the Mexican peso bucking the trend as one of the worst performers against the greenback. Societe Generale sees Mexico’s currency weakening 17 percent from Friday’s close to 23 per dollar, while Bank of America said traders already “have gone a long way toward pricing in a surprise Trump victory.” JPMorgan’s Normand predicted one-day slides of 8 percent for the peso and 5 percent for the Canadian dollar -- based on a President Trump’s power to impose protectionist measures unilaterally. The currencies of the U.S.’s neighbors would then recover some, he said, with Mexico’s central bank intervening to defend the peso and Congress moving to restrain Trump’s trade policies. Other developed-market currencies including the yen, euro, pound and franc may also gain on concern that China would dump U.S. assets and the Fed would delay tightening monetary policy, analysts said. Normand sees the yen gaining 3 percent. Commodity-linked currencies including the Canadian dollar also “would lose ground,” BMO said. The greenback could then rally in a three- to nine-month horizon as Republicans usher in tax cuts and other fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth, Bank of America said. The candidate’s hostility toward China -- including threats of steep tariffs over alleged currency manipulation -- likely would drive the offshore yuan down about 3 percent by year’s end, said Ken Cheung, a foreign-exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Hong Kong. Longer term, the currency may fall more gradually under Trump as he exerts political pressure on the country’s leaders to slow its depreciation, said Xu Gao, an economist at Everbright Securities Co. in Beijing. Risk aversion in the aftermath of a Trump win would also push down other developing-world currencies on fears that his protectionist stances could hurt emerging economies by reducing imports from them. That “could be negative for high-yielder countries,” Credit Agricole said in a report. The South Korean won may take a hit, given questions that Trump has raised about the need for U.S. troops on the North Korean border. If Republicans sweep, the euro might fall against the dollar, BMO said, because they would be inclined to open a foreign-earnings repatriation window for American companies to bring money back home, and “a high concentration of U.S.-based multinationals’ earnings are held” in Europe. Emerging Markets Clinton Wins: It’ll be risk-on if the Democrat retains control of the White House, which bodes well for developing markets. Investors may respond by bidding up Chinese defense shares because Clinton comes across as the more hawkish candidate, said Francis Cheung, head of China and Hong Kong strategy at CLSA Ltd. Commodity producers in the developing world might rally on expectations that U.S. demand will increase along with infrastructure spending. Trump Wins: “I can’t think of any country that would benefit if Trump wins,” CMC Markets’ Yang said. Evercore’s report mentioned one nation that might get a boost, suggesting investors buy Russian equities to hedge against the Clinton-leaning polls being wrong. Nadia Kazakova, a Russian oil and gas specialist for Saxo Group, said she’s not convinced the country would benefit economically from Trump. If he wins, the global shock “could strike Russian markets much harder than others” due to risk aversion and falling commodities. “And as Trump makes America great again, would he still have the heart for a great deal with not-so-great Russia?” she wrote in a report. Citigroup sees the MSCI Emerging Markets Index immediately falling at least 10 percent, with Mexican stocks leading the way down. The Institute for International Finance explained why in a report on Thursday: “Nearly 80% of Mexico’s exports go to the U.S.,” and “workers’ remittances are one of the three largest sources of foreign currency,” behind oil and tourism. One possible bright spot for Mexico: Construction companies such as Cemex SAB de CV may be positioned for contracts to build Trump’s proposed border wall. In Asia, “China will bear the brunt of risks if Trump wins,” said Ken Peng, an investment strategist at Citi Private Bank in Hong Kong, by phone. “He’ll probably introduce trade policies targeted against China,” weakening its economy. Protectionist U.S. policies also would be “bad for a lot of economies that rely a lot on exports,” said Ben Bei, an analyst at CIMB Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. Peng said exporters from South Korea and Taiwan are among those with the most to lose. Yang adds Southeast Asia exporters to the list, including companies in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. Citigroup called Latin America “most vulnerable” to U.S. protectionism. To the extent that Trump is less welcoming to workers from abroad, his victory may hurt the Philippines’ broader economy, which gets the bulk of its overseas remittances from Filipinos employed in the U.S., Yang said. “India and Indonesia will be least affected if Trump wins,” due to their robust domestic growth, Peng said. Commodities Clinton Wins: Her environmental policies, especially her promise to combat climate change, will put pressure on coal and oil. The natural gas market could get a boost from her pledge to wean power plants off coal by using gas as “a bridge” to more reliance on renewables. Trump Wins: Natural gas prices likely would suffer as coal benefits under Trump. He has promised to roll back environmental rules that squeeze coal out of the U.S. power market and promoted “clean coal” during one of the debates. Bloomberg Intelligence in September estimated that a victory by the Republican would shave 11 percent off natural gas demand in 2030 from last year’s levels, boosting coal use. Oil prices could get a lift from the return of a risk premium if Trump continues with the “bellicose language that’s been heard on the campaign trail” about Iran and scraps President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with the country, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York hedge fund focused on energy. JPMorgan’s Normand sees Brent crude oil rising to $54 a barrel by year’s end, an 18 percent gain from Friday, but not before falling 5 percent initially “in sympathy with equities, much as occurred after Brexit.” Gold, platinum and silver would the “biggest winners” if Trump wins, said Yang, the CMC Markets analyst. Since the day before the FBI’s surprise announcement about the Clinton e-mail inquiry on Oct. 28, all precious metals have risen, with silver and gold up 4.5 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively. Normand sees gold immediately rising to $1,350 an ounce if Trump wins, 3.4 percent higher than Friday, before retreating in the next month to $1,225. Copper may also get a bounce, Barclays said, citing moves in the metal’s price during the campaign suggesting “a Trump-related premium” based on his plans to boost spending on bridges, roads and the like. Normand disagrees, calling Trump’s “gargantuan infrastructure ambitions” too vague and unrealistic to support base-metal prices for long. Given the danger his trade agenda poses to Asian growth, he sees copper immediately falling 3 percent if Trump wins. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

A recent study by the JPMorgan Chase Institute showed that when daylight saving time (DST) ends, there's a 3.5 percent drop in credit card spending in the following 30 days. In particular, consumer spending on goods drops more than services, and weekday spending drops more than weekends. JPMorgan has access to millions of credit card transactions on its network, and the anonymized data allows the company to see exactly how consumer behavior changes immediately as a result of the one-hour shift. When DST begins in the spring, there is a 0.9 percent increase in daily credit card spending per capita in Los Angeles. But the 3.5 percent drop in spending that happens when DST ends means the total economic effect of DST is a net loss. Remember, this weekend's end of DST means we "fall back," turning our clocks back an hour. We all sleep an extra hour, making the mornings brighter and the evenings darker. According to JPMorgan's data, grocery stores (down 6 percent per day per capita) suffered the most among consumer goods categories. Contrast that with health care, which saw almost no drop. That makes sense, because those types of decisions aren't going to change because of the time difference. You can really see the stark difference when comparing weekday spending versus weekend spending. All of a sudden, weeknights lose an hour of light, digging into the limited time people had in the first place to shop then anyway. Then there are the fatalities If that's not bad enough, data from New York City show that the end of DST has a direct effect on the deaths of pedestrians, who are being hit by automobiles that are now being driven more in the dark. The New York Times recently reported on the issue, saying the city's Department of Transportation is concerned about added darkness increasing the danger to pedestrians during the evening commute. The city will spend $1.5 million on a "dusk and darkness" advertising campaign. Last year, there were nine pedestrian fatalities in the first eight days after DST ended on November 1. The city provides the full data on pedestrian deaths by the time of day and the week of year. While a lot of people are concerned the election could hurt economic spending and endanger people in the streets, here's the thing: It's going to happen no matter what.

But that system tends to overlook good programmers from other schools or gifted dropouts, according to recruiters. So the industry is turning to outside firms to evaluate prospective programmers based on objective measurements, not their pedigree. Bloomberg photo by Michael Nagle.   Hugh Son Bloomberg     For almost five years, Gregory Furlong worked 50-hour weeks as a shipping clerk at a Best Buy two miles from his childhood home in Wilmington, Delaware. It was a kind of employment purgatory for a computer obsessive who tinkers with motherboards in his free time. So last year, Furlong, 30, enrolled in a three-month coding boot camp that uses HackerRank, a web platform that trains and grades people on writing computer code. After earning a top ranking for Java developers globally, Furlong was hired by JPMorgan Chase in December for its two-year technology training program. This is Wall Street's new tech meritocracy. Financial institutions traditionally coveted graduates from Stanford and other big-name schools and people already working in Silicon Valley. But that system tends to overlook good programmers from other schools or gifted dropouts, according to recruiters. And besides, banks need to fill so many programming jobs that elite schools can't possibly pump out enough candidates. So the industry is looking in places it never did, turning to outside firms to evaluate prospective programmers based on objective measurements, not their pedigree. The idea is that people lacking a computer science degree -- art majors, graphic designers and chemistry graduates from the University of Delaware like Furlong -- can still make the leap to well-paid careers in technology. By using algorithms to spot talented coders, HackerRank and competitors with names like Codility claim they've essentially increased the world's supply of developers. "This is purely about skill," said 28-year-old Vivek Ravisankar, a HackerRank co-founder who used to work for Amazon.com. "Most really good programmers learn on their own and just continue to build their skills. Probably the really good programmers are college dropouts." The service is part of a broader trend among U.S. corporations to bring data rigor into recruitment, instead of relying only on resumes and interviews. Those methods have been known to perpetuate biases and aren't always predictive of on-the-job success. Goldman Sachs said in June it was overhauling the way it hires junior staff, using resume-screening software and replacing campus interviews with video submissions that are scored. "Finding people through alternate channels, we weren't doing that five years ago," said Michael Zbranak, a managing director in JPMorgan's global technology division. "Now we absolutely do it, because we've seen it work." There are at least 500,000 technology workers at banks globally, and about 10 percent of them have to be replaced annually due to attrition, according to Chris Skinner, a London-based technology consultant to financial firms. JPMorgan, with more than 40,000 technology workers, hires thousands annually just to replace those who depart. HackerRank is free for coders and makes money from fees from corporate clients. Users perform challenges and watch video tutorials to sharpen their skills in specific coding languages such as Java; solving harder problems results in higher rankings. They can also join contests set up by employers with challenges related to jobs they want to fill. Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and hedge fund Two Sigma are among HackerRank clients, as is Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News. Finance firms aren't the only ones who need help finding coders. Other clients include retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and medical products maker Stryker Corp. BlackRock uses HackerRank to evaluate each of the several hundred programmers hired annually to work on improvements to its critical Aladdin software, the investment and risk-management platform that handles $15 trillion in assets. "The old way of doing things is you cast a wide net, you get a bunch of resumes, you start screening through the resumes manually, and you hope the person looking at them is doing a good job," said Sunil Dalal, chief operating officer of the Aladdin product group. "There's a lot left to luck." Programmers are especially ripe for merit hiring. They usually can't show recruiters the code they created for past employers because of proprietary reasons, so in the past they've been judged solely by their resumes, Ravisankar said. The opaqueness of that talent market in turn created bidding wars for graduates from schools like Stanford or top tech firms, discounting coders from elsewhere, he said. Ravisankar and Hari Karunanidhi, a former IBM Corp. engineer, started HackerRank four years ago. Working in India, the pair struggled with two failed business plans until they landed on using algorithms to evaluate programmers' code. In 2012, they were accepted into Silicon Valley startup incubator Y Combinator, and soon clients included West Coast technology firms Twitter, Yelp and Dropbox. The firm, which has a million users globally, has raised almost $28 million in funding. For Furlong, who bears a resemblance to Elijah Wood from the "Lord of the Rings" movies, his new life couldn't be more different from his Best Buy days. He's more fulfilled, he says, and he's paid off student loans with pay that's double his previous earnings. He's also replaced a 2003 Volvo with a new Subaru Impreza, which he drives to JPMorgan's year-old Wilmington tech hub, a 335,000-square-foot complex filled with 2,000 developers. "Things have changed so much," Furlong said. "There's much more opportunity for people to break through and change their lives." --- Bloomberg's Dakin Campbell contributed.

Developing-nation stocks have seesawed in 2016, first making the worst start to a year ever and then swinging to a bull market. Published: 10:36 November 5, 2016 Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE London: Emerging-market share sales are tipped to rebound in 2017 from their slowest pace in more than a decade. Companies in developing nations excluding China are reviving plans for initial and secondary public offerings as they become more convinced they can generate enough demand, according to investors as well as underwriters from Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS Group AG. Sales should pick up next year, they said, once US presidential elections and the Federal Reserve’s December policy decision are out of the way. The anticipated recovery signals the rally that boosted the value of the 31 biggest emerging equity markets this year by $3.3 trillion (Dh12.1 trillion) will soon translate into appetite for primary issuance. Investors have poured $8 billion into actively managed stock funds since July, ending a 16-month stretch of outflows, according to data from EPFR Global. Active funds are a key source of capital for newly issued shares. “Issuers are more willing to engage now,” said Nick Koemtzopoulos, the head of UK and emerging-market equity capital markets at Credit Suisse in London. “We are seeing early signs of global funds doing work on emerging markets like Russia, and could see that translate into investments.” US elections Developing-nation share sales outside of China are set to drop 32 per cent per cent this year, according to Freeman & Co, a New York-based financial advisory firm. Companies have been slow to return to equity markets in part because flows into actively managed stock funds have lagged behind those that invest in bonds or exchange-traded funds. Some are also staying away as they weigh risks around the US elections on November 8, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Capital Management. “The corporates have been extremely cautious because they’ve felt the demand wouldn’t be there if they built the deal,” Anthony Cragg, a San Francisco-based portfolio manager at Wells Capital Management. Developing-nation stocks have seesawed in 2016, first making the worst start to a year ever and then swinging to a bull market. Hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve and Britain’s vote to leave the European Union caused further swings. The fragility of the rally made investors delay an unwinding of bearish bets and pushed companies to wait for greater stability, according to Georgy Egorov of UBS in London. “In order to prepare an IPO, you need at least four to five months,” said Egorov, the head of emerging-market equity capital markets at the Swiss bank. “Dramatic changes in the market have made issuers cautious on timing.” Lag effect At least twice in the past decade and a half, the IPO market took about a year to rebound after stocks started an uptrend, suggesting a lag between the two. In 2003, when a new commodity cycle spurred gains in developing-nation equities, new issues declined. The next year, share sales more than doubled. A similar trend was seen in 2009-2010. For much of 2016, the primary market was dominated by stake sales from companies in the developed world. General Electric Co sold a majority stake in its Czech banking unit at the bottom of the target-price range. Barclays Plc and UniCredit SpA, looking to strengthen capital, cut stakes in Barclays Africa Group Ltd and Poland’s Bank Pekao SA, respectively. That is now changing. The value of public offerings jumped 35 per cent to $27 billion since June from the same period last year, according to Freeman & Co, and local companies are among the major issuers. Mexico’s largest pipeline operator, Infraestructura Energetica Nova SAB de CV, raised $1.45 billion in Latin America’s biggest offering since April. Brazil’s world-beating equity performance enabled Alliar Medicos A Frente SA, a medical-diagnostics company, to raise $242 million in the country’s first IPO since 2015. South Korea’s Lotte Group revived plans for a $4.5 billion offering of its hotel unit, while Samsung Biologics Co priced its $2 billion issue at the top of the price range. “I’m cautiously optimistic,” Egorov of UBS said.

The biannual time shift coming this weekend means you’ll soon be leaving for work in the dark and grumbling about how your sleep cycle is thrown out of whack. But there’s another big area of your life you likely didn’t realize was affected by daylight saving time: your wallet. A new study out from JPMorgan Chase Institute found that the switch back to standard time is associated with a drop in spending between 2.2% and 4.9%, depending on where you live. Daylight saving time starts in the spring when clocks are pushed forward an hour and ends in the fall when clock are set back to standard time. The policy affects over 300 million Americans. One of the supposed advantages of the policy is that the extra hour of sunlight encourages Americans to stay out and spend money, giving a boost to small businesses and the economy in general. To test that theory, JPMorgan compared spending in two cities—Los Angeles and Phoenix—in the 30 days before and after the start of DST in March, and 30 days before and after the end of DST in November. Los Angeles has an additional hour of post-work sunlight while Phoenix, which doesn’t follow DST, remains unchanged. Read more: Why We Need Daylight Saving Time Year Round “If the extra hour induces additional spending, we would expect to see an increase in local commerce in Los Angeles relative to local commerce in Phoenix,” the study’s authors write. “In November, the opposite should happen.” But that’s not what happens. Researchers found that while there is an slight increase in spending in the spring, the corresponding drop in the fall is larger. The analysis found the time switch is associated with a 0.9% increase in daily card spending per capita in Los Angeles at the beginning of DST, but a reduction in daily card spending per capita of 3.5% at the end of DST. Daily card spending drops significantly more during the week in Los Angeles than during the weekend. Supermarkets are the most affected category covered in the study, losing almost 6% of daily retail per capita spent at the end of DST. Because the magnitude of the drop in spending in November outweighs increased spending at the beginning of DST, that calls into question whether the policy is actually a booster to the economy. JPMorgan researchers also found that the spending effects varied depending on geography. In San Diego, for example, the authors found a relative increase of 2.9% at the beginning of DST and a relative decrease of 2.2% at the end of DST. In Denver, the switch was associated relative increase at the start of DST was 0.8%, while the relative decrease at the end was 4.9%. Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

David Lynch Foundation/YouTube Around eight years ago, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio introduced Transcendental Meditation to his 735 employees. Dalio had already established a unique, intense culture at Bridgewater that he likes to say is akin to being part of an "intellectual Navy SEALs," and he believed that Transcendental Meditation, or TM, would work as an effective counterbalance. "I did it because it's the greatest gift I could give anyone — it brings about equanimity, creativity, and peace," Dalio told me in an email. Since then, TM has popped into the mainstream, and over the last three years, the David Lynch Foundation TM center has taught almost 2,500 professionals — 1,150 in 2016 alone — and roughly 55% are from Wall Street. Dalio has always done things differently, from having his employees memorize his list of life "Principles" or recording their conversations as part of a culture of "radical transparency." So his obsession with TM isn't surprising, but what is unusual is the way that it has caught on with the rest of Wall Street over the past few years. Dalio began practicing TM in 1969 as a college student, after seeing that its founder, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, taught it to the Beatles. Dalio is also one of the biggest supporters of the David Lynch Foundation — founded by the acclaimed director ("Twin Peaks," "Mulholland Drive") in 2005 to teach TM for free to underserved students, veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, and victims of domestic abuse — and has donated about $20 million to the DLF through the Dalio Foundation over the past decade, with funds specifically allocated to students in New York and San Francisco and veterans. The Dalio Foundation accounts for 20% of the DLF's funding. I wanted to find out why Dalio would speak so emphatically and passionately about this meditation technique, and why other power players like Third Point manager Dan Loeb and JPMorgan wealth management CEO Barry Sommers were compelling others in finance to try it out. And as someone who had been practicing mindfulness meditation for nearly a year, I was questioning the bureaucracy and mystery of TM, wondering if it was all a racket constructed over a simple, overblown technique. Film director David Lynch's foundation has become the go-to TM center for Wall Street. Bryan Bedder/Getty Images Over the past six weeks, I spent hours talking to many people about their own experiences with TM, went through years of scientific studies conducted, dug into the organization that teaches it, and pored over the ancient literature and tradition that inspired the founder to develop and spread the technique. Knowing I couldn't truly understand its appeal without experiencing the practice, I learned TM through the DLF and have practiced it for the recommended two 20-minute sessions every day, missing only a few sessions. The foundation offered to waive its $960 fee, which it had done with other journalists, so I'd have more context for my research. Practitioners can go deep into the history of TM and even learn advanced techniques for deeper meditations, but at its heart, TM is a simple and effective technique, and those who stick to the basics can still see real results. It's one of the reasons hyper-busy, intense investors are embracing it. Bob Roth, the foundation's executive director, and my teacher, Mario Orsatti, are thrilled by the rising interest, which surprises even them. Because of a number of coinciding factors — the recent cultural normalization of meditation in the US, public evangelizing by figures like Dalio and Jerry Seinfeld, increasingly distracted lives, increasingly frustrating markets, and the fact that institutions such as the American Heart Association have cleared TM as a tool for a healthy lifestyle — TM is having its moment on the Street. Bringing meditation to the West Any TM student will be shown videos of the Maharishi, a small man with long wispy hair, a scraggly beard, a high-pitched voice, and a penchant for giggling. Born in India as Mahesh Prasad Varma in 1918, he renounced his name and familial ties in typical Hindu monk fashion after graduating from Allahabad University in 1942 with a physics degree and traveling to Jyotir Math in the Indian Himalayas to study under and serve Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, the man he reverentially called Guru Dev, which literally means "divine teacher." TM founder Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1975. AP Saraswati was the leader of the city's monastery. When the Maharishi — a title that means "seer" and is commonly used as shorthand — began his global tour of spreading TM in 1958, he made it clear that although he and his guru were Hindu monks and TM was rooted in the ancient Vedic scriptures, his practice was not tied to the Hindu faith. Because of the caste he was born into, the Maharishi could not succeed Saraswati, but Saraswati entrusted him with the mission of spreading meditation around the world for the purpose of fostering peace. The mission was not religious proselytizing, but rather making available a technique that anyone, whether they were Hindu, Christian, or atheist, could practice. "I think where we are today is where Maharishi always wanted it to be — which is science-based, and evidence-based, and fits in with medicine and mainstream wellness programs," Roth told me. He said the Maharishi, whom he knew from 1970 until the Maharishi's death in 2008, was as scientific as he was spiritual, and that he believed that the health benefits he felt from meditation could be proven. Researching the effects of TM was one of the reasons he founded a college, the Maharishi University of Management, in Fairfield, Iowa, in 1971. Though I was skeptical of research coming from such a potentially biased source, the school has received tens of millions of dollars from the National Institutes of Health — a federal organization that does not liberally give out that level of funding. The school's findings have also been corroborated by other institutions, like Harvard Medical School and Stanford Medical School. The wealth of peer-reviewed research on TM's ability to lower blood pressure and decrease the presence of stress-causing hormones at a rate significantly higher than other forms of stress relief has caused institutions such as the AHA to inspire doctors to tell their patients about it. Mike Nudelman/Business Insider Meditating at the world's largest hedge fund Dalio brought TM to his Bridgewater through the foundation's teachers, who still regularly visit. Practitioners must learn TM from a certified teacher, who gives them one of many mantras, a meaningless "vibration sound," and assists them with perfecting the technique. Meditators sit still for 20 minutes and repeat this mantra in their head, letting thoughts float by and possibly "transcending," reaching a pleasant and invigorating state of "restful alertness." The initial deal Dalio proposed around 2008 was that any employee with a tenure of six months or longer could take the $1,000 four-month course and, upon completion, Dalio would reimburse half the cost out of his own pocket. After a few years, the course became popular, and many employees began regularly meditating twice a day. Dalio and his management team decided that it would be best to create a formal corporate reimbursement and training plan. Bridgewater Associates' headquarters in Westport, Connecticut. Bridgewater Associates In the past eight years, around 500 employees have been trained. (Bridgewater's employee count ranged from roughly 735 to 1,700 employees in that time.) Also in that time, Dalio has become easily the most vocal and influential proponent of TM in the finance community. Though Bridgewater, which now has $150 billion in assets under management, became the world's largest hedge fund in 2005, it remained largely under the radar until 2011, when Dalio received mainstream press, including a full profile in The New Yorker. When the media asked him about his "secrets to success," he would laud TM. As he's quoted as saying in the 2011 book "Transcendence," not coincidentally written by his son Paul's psychiatrist, Norman Rosenthal, TM is "the single biggest influence" in his life. It was Paul who convinced Rosenthal to revisit TM, which Rosenthal had learned years before, and to investigate it from a scientific standpoint. Both Paul and his father are quoted in "Transcendence" and its 2016 follow-up, "Super Mind," and Rosenthal has supplemented his career as a practicing psychiatrist and Georgetown Medical School professor with speaking tours about the health benefits of TM. This increase in literature about the health benefits of TM is one of the reasons the practice has exploded in popularity over the past few years, despite being taught in the US since the 1960s. It's connected especially during this time with Wall Street power players, many of whom now practice it daily. TM on Wall Street As Andrew Ross Sorkin, the founder of The New York Times Dealbook, told me over email, "Trading is a mental game, and anything that gives you even a slight edge is valuable." Sorkin has been practicing TM "on and off" for the past three years. Brian Koppelman and David Levien, Sorkin's cocreators on the Showtime series "Billions" are regular meditators. The show is about a corrupt hedge funder's battles with a US attorney, and both characters have scenes where they try to collect themselves during TM sessions — a manifestation of the creators' shared habit as well as a nod to TM's recent rise in the financial world. At the David Lynch Foundation, I took two group classes with Didier Phitoussi, who has been in the hedge fund industry for 23 years. I caught up with him recently, and he told me that he feels as though it has caught on in that world at this specific moment in time because "no one has been making any money." Phitoussi told me that for investors, it's "being in front of a computer, looking for ways to make money and not finding anything. It's very frustrating." TM, he thinks, allows people in these situations to better deal with this stress and have a clearer head — similar to the way people would abuse a drug, he said, except meditation is healthy. David Lynch Foundation Executive Director Bob Roth, left, and Director of the Center of Leadership Performance Mario Orsatti have taught TM to Wall Street's power players. Sarah Jacobs For Mark Axelowitz, managing director at UBS Wealth Management, the first step to become a meditator was reading Dalio's "Principles." Axelowitz was reading up on Dalio before he called to ask him if he'd like to speak at his and Bill Ackman's annual fundraiser for the Boys & Girls Harbor foundation. Early in "Principles," Dalio writes about how he discovered meditation in college after seeing that the Beatles did it. "It helped me think more clearly and creatively, so I'm sure that enhanced my enjoyment of, and success at, learning," Dalio wrote. "The second I read that I decided I'm done — I'm meditating," Axelowitz said. During his call with Dalio, Axelowitz asked him how he could begin meditating, and Dalio referred him to the David Lynch Foundation. Axelowitz began learning the next month, January 2012. Since then, he has practiced it every day, missing only one or two of the twice-daily sessions each week, if any. He now serves on the foundation's board. When I asked him if he had any reservations about TM, he said he could see no downside at the time, since no one was forcing him to do or believe anything he didn't want to. And if it proved ineffective, he'd be giving himself some time to rest. Ray Dalio, left, with "Super Mind" author Norman Rosenthal and UBS Wealth Management managing director Mark Axelowitz in 2016. Mark Axelowitz "I had at the time a Blackberry and an iPhone, and my life was nonstop work," Axelowitz said. He said he's awake 18 hours a day, and that his time is split among his Wall Street job, philanthropy, his side job as an actor — he's had numerous bit parts in big productions since 2004 — and his three kids. "And I knew that if TM did not work, it gave me 40 minutes of downtime, with no interruption," he said. But he found that it profoundly affected him. He said that since making TM a daily habit, he has been able to have a clearer mind, which has allowed him to be more present in both his professional and personal life. He also believes this regular training of his mind has allowed him to be more creative, which has allowed him to take on more significant and enjoyable acting gigs. And to make everything more attractive, as it does for many Wall Streeters, he believed in the foundation's mission of teaching the technique to those who could benefit from it but can't afford its $960 price tag. The foundation was created in 2005 to take a fee from those who could afford it and use that money to teach veterans with PTSD, students in underserved schools, and victims of abuse. The foundation told me that all funds go toward operations, and that "paying for others to learn" means subsidizing the work hours of a teacher on a pro bono lesson; I was told DLF teachers have salaries of roughly $40,000 to $80,000. Over the past 11 years, the foundation has taught more than 500,000 people for free. Axelowitz became a trustee of the foundation and would invite some of his buddies on Wall Street to informational events. He said he's always happy to encourage others to look into learning TM from the foundation if they ask about it. He believes this network effect is one of the fundamental reasons the technique has spiked in popularity among finance types. I spoke with two of the people to whom he's recommended it: Ken Gunsberger, a senior vice president at UBS Financial Services, and Barry Friedberg, CEO of the hedge fund FriedbergMilstein. Both Gunsberger and Friedberg have also donated to the foundation. "When you're investing in the market, and the markets are moving around ... a lot of people get very emotional," Gunsberger said. "So it affects your day. If you have a stock or a fund that's not doing well temporarily, it bogs you down, it bothers you, so it affects your productivity. TM allows you to think through that, to see through that, and be less emotional." UBS Financial Services senior vice president Ken Gunsberger meditates in his office in a moment captured for DLF video. DLFTV/Vimeo Gunsberger has been practicing it daily for the past two years, after Axelowitz recommended it to him during a particularly rough period in his life. Gunsberger told me he noticed the effects of TM a month after practicing it. He was no longer feeling frantic or distracted. Gunsberger added that, like both Dalio and Lynch have said, he will have TM sessions where a thought passes through his head that suddenly provides a solution he's been looking for. The practice itself gets its name from the idea of "transcendence," a unique, blissful feeling of simultaneous detachment and awareness that arises when the mind is quiet. But these moments are not required of a TM meditation, and in between them the passing of ideas can start to feel less chaotic. That's what allows the mind to seemingly magically stumble upon the answer to a question it has been trying to solve. Friedberg is also drawn to this invigorating sensory deprivation that is so elusive to Wall Streeters. "I never leave a session where I don't feel energized," he told me. "I've almost never had a meditation session where I didn't get a good idea." He's been practicing TM for the past two years, initially doing the full 40 minutes every day, but cutting down the 20-minute sessions to 15 minutes, and practicing now four or five days each week — yet still feeling "substantial benefits" to his mood and creative process. He had tried mindfulness meditation and yoga throughout his life, and so he was open to trying TM when Axelowitz told him about it over lunch two years ago. He was further intrigued by the foundation's philanthropic mission, and decided the lesson fee was money well spent. Dalio himself is far from a casual meditator using the technique as a way to take some quiet time — he seeks out moments of transcendence and has found them to have changed the way he interacts with life. He told Rosenthal, in a passage from "Transcendence" now regularly cited in the TM community, that his decades of practicing TM have made him more "centered," in the sense of "being in a calm, clear-headed state so that when challenges come at you, you can deal with them like a ninja — in a calm, thoughtful way. "When you're centered, your emotions are not hijacking you. You have the ability to think clearly, put things in their right place, and have good perspective." The appeal of philanthropic self-help Middle school students meditate in a Los Angeles school. The David Lynch Foundation teaches TM to middle school and high school students in underserved areas free of charge. DLFTV/Vimeo Roth and Orsatti think TM has finally weathered the storm of misunderstanding or dismissal and is only going to get more popular. Lynch agrees. "In the past 11 years I have seen a complete transformation in the recognition by the scientific community of the benefits of TM for reducing stress, improving health, and promoting creativity and performance," he wrote to me in an email. "My goal for the foundation is to ensure that TM is available, at no cost, to every person who suffers from trauma and toxic stress — veterans with PTSD, abused women, and young people in underserved schools." With the foundation as Wall Street's go-to meditation center, Lynch's mission is gaining traction as its wealthy business practitioners eagerly fund its pro bono work and scholarships for interested students who can't afford the full fee. The scientific validation of TM, the increased popularity of meditation in general, and the ease of learning are all reasons its spreading. But it's also because of people like Ray Dalio. "They see Ray's success — how are you going to argue with a guy who makes $5 million a day?" Gunsberger said. "You going to argue with that?"

JP Morgan Chase Institute compared credit card transactions in Los Angeles, a city that turns its clocks back one hour in the fall, and Pheonix, which does not take part in daylight saving time. Researchers found that consumers spend significantly less at the end of daylight saving time, when clocks go back one hour. Daily spending per capita drops 3.5 per cent, compared to a smaller 0.9 per cent boost at the start of daylight saving time in May. Grocery stores are hardest hit, with a 6 per cent drop in spending, while gas stations, retailers and discount stores lose 4.5 per cent. The JP Morgan results match with a body of research on DST that show more losses than gains from switching back and fort, said Werner Antweiler, a professor of economics at the University of British Columbia. In 2015 Antweiler surveyed a number of studies on daylight saving time for a blog post questioning whether Canada should abolish DST. A study of Indiana’s introduction of DST in 2007 showed that people used less energy for lighting their homes, but more for heating, resulting in an overall 1 per cent increase in electricity use. Other researchers have found energy efficient lighting is now erasing past gains in energy savings. People don’t just feel tired after falling back: they are less productive at work and worse drivers. UBC professor Mark Levi documented the “Monday” effect — workers are less productive at the start of the week — and found that the effect is “magnified” by 200-500 per cent on the Monday following the end of DST. Levi calculated the effect could result in a $31 billion one-day loss on the stock exchange. Daylight saving time can even be deadly: one study found that extending DST to be all year-round would reduce pedestrian fatalities by 13 per cent, and traffic deaths by 3 per cent. The JP Morgan survey notes that daylight saving time is a “live issue,” with California recently debating a bill to end DST and Washington State considering legislation last year. But Antweiler doesn’t think Canada will move to change the current system until more American jurisdictions lead the way. Most people don’t suffer that much from the switch, save for a day of “jetlag,” Antweiler said. It’s only when researchers study the entire range of effects that the negative patterns, like an increase in traffic accidents, show up.

Governments keen to lock in record-low borrowing rates have obliged by issuing longer and longer debt. A spate of 30-year and 50-year issuances have seen average maturities rise to 9.8 years, from 8.5 in 2011, according to JP Morgan's global government bond index - a huge shift for the multi-trillion dollar market. However if central banks raise rates to boost growth, bond prices will fall, with longer-dated ones sinking more sharply. This could trigger a sell-off that could be as bad or worse than the 2013 market rout - the "taper tantrum" - when the U.S. Federal Reserve began tapering its massive bond-buying programme, according to fund managers. At least one major central bank – the Fed – is imminently looking to raise rates and others in Japan and European countries, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, are looking at ways to tighten policy.This undermines the status of government bonds as "safe haven" assets, and leaves traditionally conservative pension, endowment and insurance funds loaded with "safe" bonds that now face huge capital losses if interest rates do indeed turn."It will be much worse than the taper tantrum in the U.S.," said Louis Gargour, chief investment officer at London-based credit hedge fund LNG Capital. "That move was caused by the anticipation of rates going higher. Now the reality is setting in and the cycle has changed and the market is done. I think the effect will be significantly more dramatic." 70-YEAR BOND Longer-dated bonds typically have a higher "duration" – a calculation used to determine how long it takes to recoup your original investment via annual coupons – which makes their prices far more sensitive to an interest rate hike. The average duration of global bond portfolios is at a record high of seven years, from five years in 2008, International Monetary Fund data. This comes at a time when demand for bonds has grown more than any other asset class - by $410 billion this year alone, Lipper data shows.The stretching of the so-called duration of many funds' bond portfolios around the world shows how vulnerable the assets are to a severe crash. "The possibility of a sharp rise in interest rates (causing a reaction) akin to the previous taper tantrum is a scenario we are highly focused on," said Kathleen Hughes, head of European institutional sales at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. Austria's recent 2 billion euro 70-year bond is one high-profile example of how state borrowers have issued longer and longer debt to take advantage of low rates. The duration of that bond is estimated to be a whopping 42 years, and buyers have already suffered some pain. Robeco portfolio manager Jeroen Blokland estimates that when the yield on the Austria bond rose 20 basis points in the short time after it launched, buyers would have lost as much as 8 percent of their investment. CONVEXITY COMPLEXITY Tanguy Le Saout, head of European fixed income at Pioneer Investments, said the attraction lies in another bond market calculation called "convexity" - or how the duration of the bond changes with movements in rates. "If the yield of the Austrian 2086 bond were to rise by 50bp (basis points), the price will drop by about 17 points - say from 97 to 80. However, if its yield were to drop by 50bp, the price goes up by 23 points - say from 97 to 120," he said. Others have bought long-dated bonds in the past to hedge against the possibility of the euro zone bloc falling into a Japan-style deflationary spiral. [nL5N1816BQ]Anthony Doyle, fund manager at M&G Investments, said prices of longer-duration debt tended to fall further in a sell-off but the bonds would likely find buyers in the form of pension funds and insurance companies, looking to match liabilities. "You're more likely to see most of the action at the belly of the curve, so the 10-year is where you'll see most of the price action," he added. At least one major investor believes a sell-off would be tempered by the overwhelming demand for a return of any form. In the case of the European Central Bank - which is widely believed to be reconsidering its aggressive stimulus stance of recent years - it would still be buying bonds for several months longer even if announced a taper, said Seamus Mac Gorain, portfolio manager at JP Morgan Asset Management."So while yields are likely to remain under pressure in the near term, a rise in yields will ultimately become a buying opportunity for investors."

 Transcendental Meditation, which Bridgewater's Ray Dalio calls 'the single biggest influence' on his life, is taking over Wall Street Richard Feloni Nov. 4, 2016, 1:45 PM 22,420 facebook linkedin twitter email print Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio. David Lynch Foundation/YouTube Around eight years ago, Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio introduced Transcendental Meditation to his 735 employees. Dalio had already established a unique, intense culture at Bridgewater that he likes to say is akin to being part of an "intellectual Navy SEALs," and he believed that Transcendental Meditation, or TM, would work as an effective counterbalance. "I did it because it's the greatest gift I could give anyone — it brings about equanimity, creativity, and peace," Dalio told me in an email. Since then, TM has popped into the mainstream, and over the last three years, the David Lynch Foundation TM center has taught almost 2,500 professionals — 1,150 in 2016 alone — and roughly 55% are from Wall Street. Dalio has always done things differently, from having his employees memorize his list of life "Principles" or recording their conversations as part of a culture of "radical transparency." So his obsession with TM isn't surprising, but what is unusual is the way that it has caught on with the rest of Wall Street over the past few years. Dalio began practicing TM in 1969 as a college student, after seeing that its founder, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, taught it to the Beatles. Dalio is also one of the biggest supporters of the David Lynch Foundation — founded by the acclaimed director ("Twin Peaks," "Mulholland Drive") in 2005 to teach TM for free to underserved students, veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, and victims of domestic abuse — and has donated about $20 million to the DLF through the Dalio Foundation over the past decade, with funds specifically allocated to students in New York and San Francisco and veterans. The Dalio Foundation accounts for 20% of the DLF's funding. I wanted to find out why Dalio would speak so emphatically and passionately about this meditation technique, and why other power players like Third Point manager Dan Loeb and JPMorgan wealth management CEO Barry Sommers were compelling others in finance to try it out. And as someone who had been practicing mindfulness meditation for nearly a year, I was questioning the bureaucracy and mystery of TM, wondering if it was all a racket constructed over a simple, overblown technique. Film director David Lynch's foundation has become the go-to TM center for Wall Street. Bryan Bedder/Getty Images Over the past six weeks, I spent hours talking to many people about their own experiences with TM, went through years of scientific studies conducted, dug into the organization that teaches it, and pored over the ancient literature and tradition that inspired the founder to develop and spread the technique. Knowing I couldn't truly understand its appeal without experiencing the practice, I learned TM through the DLF and have practiced it for the recommended two 20-minute sessions every day, missing only a few sessions. The foundation offered to waive its $960 fee, which it had done with other journalists, so I'd have more context for my research. Practitioners can go deep into the history of TM and even learn advanced techniques for deeper meditations, but at its heart, TM is a simple and effective technique, and those who stick to the basics can still see real results. It's one of the reasons hyper-busy, intense investors are embracing it. Bob Roth, the foundation's executive director, and my teacher, Mario Orsatti, are thrilled by the rising interest, which surprises even them. Because of a number of coinciding factors — the recent cultural normalization of meditation in the US, public evangelizing by figures like Dalio and Jerry Seinfeld, increasingly distracted lives, increasingly frustrating markets, and the fact that institutions such as the American Heart Association have cleared TM as a tool for a healthy lifestyle — TM is having its moment on the Street. Bringing meditation to the West Any TM student will be shown videos of the Maharishi, a small man with long wispy hair, a scraggly beard, a high-pitched voice, and a penchant for giggling. Born in India as Mahesh Prasad Varma in 1918, he renounced his name and familial ties in typical Hindu monk fashion after graduating from Allahabad University in 1942 with a physics degree and traveling to Jyotir Math in the Indian Himalayas to study under and serve Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, the man he reverentially called Guru Dev, which literally means "divine teacher." TM founder Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1975. AP Saraswati was the leader of the city's monastery. When the Maharishi — a title that means "seer" and is commonly used as shorthand — began his global tour of spreading TM in 1958, he made it clear that although he and his guru were Hindu monks and TM was rooted in the ancient Vedic scriptures, his practice was not tied to the Hindu faith. Because of the caste he was born into, the Maharishi could not succeed Saraswati, but Saraswati entrusted him with the mission of spreading meditation around the world for the purpose of fostering peace. The mission was not religious proselytizing, but rather making available a technique that anyone, whether they were Hindu, Christian, or atheist, could practice. "I think where we are today is where Maharishi always wanted it to be — which is science-based, and evidence-based, and fits in with medicine and mainstream wellness programs," Roth told me. He said the Maharishi, whom he knew from 1970 until the Maharishi's death in 2008, was as scientific as he was spiritual, and that he believed that the health benefits he felt from meditation could be proven. Researching the effects of TM was one of the reasons he founded a college, the Maharishi University of Management, in Fairfield, Iowa, in 1971. Though I was skeptical of research coming from such a potentially biased source, the school has received tens of millions of dollars from the National Institutes of Health — a federal organization that does not liberally give out that level of funding. The school's findings have also been corroborated by other institutions, like Harvard Medical School and Stanford Medical School. The wealth of peer-reviewed research on TM's ability to lower blood pressure and decrease the presence of stress-causing hormones at a rate significantly higher than other forms of stress relief has caused institutions such as the AHA to inspire doctors to tell their patients about it. Mike Nudelman/Business Insider Meditating at the world's largest hedge fund Dalio brought TM to his Bridgewater through the foundation's teachers, who still regularly visit. Practitioners must learn TM from a certified teacher, who gives them one of many mantras, a meaningless "vibration sound," and assists them with perfecting the technique. Meditators sit still for 20 minutes and repeat this mantra in their head, letting thoughts float by and possibly "transcending," reaching a pleasant and invigorating state of "restful alertness." The initial deal Dalio proposed around 2008 was that any employee with a tenure of six months or longer could take the $1,000 four-month course and, upon completion, Dalio would reimburse half the cost out of his own pocket. After a few years, the course became popular, and many employees began regularly meditating twice a day. Dalio and his management team decided that it would be best to create a formal corporate reimbursement and training plan. Bridgewater Associates' headquarters in Westport, Connecticut. Bridgewater Associates In the past eight years, around 500 employees have been trained. (Bridgewater's employee count ranged from roughly 735 to 1,700 employees in that time.) Also in that time, Dalio has become easily the most vocal and influential proponent of TM in the finance community. Though Bridgewater, which now has $150 billion in assets under management, became the world's largest hedge fund in 2005, it remained largely under the radar until 2011, when Dalio received mainstream press, including a full profile in The New Yorker. When the media asked him about his "secrets to success," he would laud TM. As he's quoted as saying in the 2011 book "Transcendence," not coincidentally written by his son Paul's psychiatrist, Norman Rosenthal, TM is "the single biggest influence" in his life. It was Paul who convinced Rosenthal to revisit TM, which Rosenthal had learned years before, and to investigate it from a scientific standpoint. Both Paul and his father are quoted in "Transcendence" and its 2016 follow-up, "Super Mind," and Rosenthal has supplemented his career as a practicing psychiatrist and Georgetown Medical School professor with speaking tours about the health benefits of TM. This increase in literature about the health benefits of TM is one of the reasons the practice has exploded in popularity over the past few years, despite being taught in the US since the 1960s. It's connected especially during this time with Wall Street power players, many of whom now practice it daily. TM on Wall Street As Andrew Ross Sorkin, the founder of The New York Times Dealbook, told me over email, "Trading is a mental game, and anything that gives you even a slight edge is valuable." Sorkin has been practicing TM "on and off" for the past three years. Brian Koppelman and David Levien, Sorkin's cocreators on the Showtime series "Billions" are regular meditators. The show is about a corrupt hedge funder's battles with a US attorney, and both characters have scenes where they try to collect themselves during TM sessions — a manifestation of the creators' shared habit as well as a nod to TM's recent rise in the financial world. At the David Lynch Foundation, I took two group classes with Didier Phitoussi, who has been in the hedge fund industry for 23 years. I caught up with him recently, and he told me that he feels as though it has caught on in that world at this specific moment in time because "no one has been making any money." Phitoussi told me that for investors, it's "being in front of a computer, looking for ways to make money and not finding anything. It's very frustrating." TM, he thinks, allows people in these situations to better deal with this stress and have a clearer head — similar to the way people would abuse a drug, he said, except meditation is healthy. David Lynch Foundation Executive Director Bob Roth, left, and Director of the Center of Leadership Performance Mario Orsatti have taught TM to Wall Street's power players. Sarah Jacobs For Mark Axelowitz, managing director at UBS Wealth Management, the first step to become a meditator was reading Dalio's "Principles." Axelowitz was reading up on Dalio before he called to ask him if he'd like to speak at his and Bill Ackman's annual fundraiser for the Boys & Girls Harbor foundation. Early in "Principles," Dalio writes about how he discovered meditation in college after seeing that the Beatles did it. "It helped me think more clearly and creatively, so I'm sure that enhanced my enjoyment of, and success at, learning," Dalio wrote. "The second I read that I decided I'm done — I'm meditating," Axelowitz said. During his call with Dalio, Axelowitz asked him how he could begin meditating, and Dalio referred him to the David Lynch Foundation. Axelowitz began learning the next month, January 2012. Since then, he has practiced it every day, missing only one or two of the twice-daily sessions each week, if any. He now serves on the foundation's board. When I asked him if he had any reservations about TM, he said he could see no downside at the time, since no one was forcing him to do or believe anything he didn't want to. And if it proved ineffective, he'd be giving himself some time to rest. Ray Dalio, left, with "Super Mind" author Norman Rosenthal and UBS Wealth Management managing director Mark Axelowitz in 2016. Mark Axelowitz "I had at the time a Blackberry and an iPhone, and my life was nonstop work," Axelowitz said. He said he's awake 18 hours a day, and that his time is split among his Wall Street job, philanthropy, his side job as an actor — he's had numerous bit parts in big productions since 2004 — and his three kids. "And I knew that if TM did not work, it gave me 40 minutes of downtime, with no interruption," he said. But he found that it profoundly affected him. He said that since making TM a daily habit, he has been able to have a clearer mind, which has allowed him to be more present in both his professional and personal life. He also believes this regular training of his mind has allowed him to be more creative, which has allowed him to take on more significant and enjoyable acting gigs. And to make everything more attractive, as it does for many Wall Streeters, he believed in the foundation's mission of teaching the technique to those who could benefit from it but can't afford its $960 price tag. The foundation was created in 2005 to take a fee from those who could afford it and use that money to teach veterans with PTSD, students in underserved schools, and victims of abuse. The foundation told me that all funds go toward operations, and that "paying for others to learn" means subsidizing the work hours of a teacher on a pro bono lesson; I was told DLF teachers have salaries of roughly $40,000 to $80,000. Over the past 11 years, the foundation has taught more than 500,000 people for free. Axelowitz became a trustee of the foundation and would invite some of his buddies on Wall Street to informational events. He said he's always happy to encourage others to look into learning TM from the foundation if they ask about it. He believes this network effect is one of the fundamental reasons the technique has spiked in popularity among finance types. I spoke with two of the people to whom he's recommended it: Ken Gunsberger, a senior vice president at UBS Financial Services, and Barry Friedberg, CEO of the hedge fund FriedbergMilstein. Both Gunsberger and Friedberg have also donated to the foundation. "When you're investing in the market, and the markets are moving around ... a lot of people get very emotional," Gunsberger said. "So it affects your day. If you have a stock or a fund that's not doing well temporarily, it bogs you down, it bothers you, so it affects your productivity. TM allows you to think through that, to see through that, and be less emotional." UBS Financial Services senior vice president Ken Gunsberger meditates in his office in a moment captured for DLF video. DLFTV/Vimeo Gunsberger has been practicing it daily for the past two years, after Axelowitz recommended it to him during a particularly rough period in his life. Gunsberger told me he noticed the effects of TM a month after practicing it. He was no longer feeling frantic or distracted. Gunsberger added that, like both Dalio and Lynch have said, he will have TM sessions where a thought passes through his head that suddenly provides a solution he's been looking for. The practice itself gets its name from the idea of "transcendence," a unique, blissful feeling of simultaneous detachment and awareness that arises when the mind is quiet. But these moments are not required of a TM meditation, and in between them the passing of ideas can start to feel less chaotic. That's what allows the mind to seemingly magically stumble upon the answer to a question it has been trying to solve. Friedberg is also drawn to this invigorating sensory deprivation that is so elusive to Wall Streeters. "I never leave a session where I don't feel energized," he told me. "I've almost never had a meditation session where I didn't get a good idea." He's been practicing TM for the past two years, initially doing the full 40 minutes every day, but cutting down the 20-minute sessions to 15 minutes, and practicing now four or five days each week — yet still feeling "substantial benefits" to his mood and creative process. He had tried mindfulness meditation and yoga throughout his life, and so he was open to trying TM when Axelowitz told him about it over lunch two years ago. He was further intrigued by the foundation's philanthropic mission, and decided the lesson fee was money well spent. Dalio himself is far from a casual meditator using the technique as a way to take some quiet time — he seeks out moments of transcendence and has found them to have changed the way he interacts with life. He told Rosenthal, in a passage from "Transcendence" now regularly cited in the TM community, that his decades of practicing TM have made him more "centered," in the sense of "being in a calm, clear-headed state so that when challenges come at you, you can deal with them like a ninja — in a calm, thoughtful way. "When you're centered, your emotions are not hijacking you. You have the ability to think clearly, put things in their right place, and have good perspective." The appeal of philanthropic self-help Middle school students meditate in a Los Angeles school. The David Lynch Foundation teaches TM to middle school and high school students in underserved areas free of charge. DLFTV/Vimeo Roth and Orsatti think TM has finally weathered the storm of misunderstanding or dismissal and is only going to get more popular. Lynch agrees. "In the past 11 years I have seen a complete transformation in the recognition by the scientific community of the benefits of TM for reducing stress, improving health, and promoting creativity and performance," he wrote to me in an email. "My goal for the foundation is to ensure that TM is available, at no cost, to every person who suffers from trauma and toxic stress — veterans with PTSD, abused women, and young people in underserved schools." With the foundation as Wall Street's go-to meditation center, Lynch's mission is gaining traction as its wealthy business practitioners eagerly fund its pro bono work and scholarships for interested students who can't afford the full fee. The scientific validation of TM, the increased popularity of meditation in general, and the ease of learning are all reasons its spreading. But it's also because of people like Ray Dalio. "They see Ray's success — how are you going to argue with a guy who makes $5 million a day?" Gunsberger said. "You going to argue with that?"
