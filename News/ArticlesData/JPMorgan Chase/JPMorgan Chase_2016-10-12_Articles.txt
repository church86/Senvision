In a landmark case, the Financial Services Authority is challenging a lower court decision that it improperly identified Achilles Macris when it fined JPMorgan 138 million pounds ($170 million) over the so-called "London Whale" scandal in 2013. The hearing in the Supreme Court, which could take three months to publish a judgment, is being closely watched by lawyers as it will set a precedent for seven similar cases in which traders say they were unfairly criticised in FCA penalty notices but were unable to contest findings. Macris was the former chief investment officer of JPMorgan's synthetic credit portfolio team in London, which ran up $6.2 billion in losses in 2012 in what were called the "London Whale" trades because of their magnitude. The bank was fined $1.0 billion by U.S. and UK regulators for management failings. The 55-year-old Greek citizen has so far argued successfully that the FCA's reference in its JPMorgan enforcement notice to "CIO London management" referred to a particular individual and not to a body of people. Former Deutsche Bank trader Christian Bittar won a similar case last year after arguing that although he had not been named, he had been identified when the FCA fined the bank in a rate rigging investigation in 2015. The debate hinges in part on how the identification principle should be broadened beyond the use of proper names or unique job titles, as those working in financial services can be more easily identified by peers than ordinary readers. THIRD PARTY RIGHTS The FCA's enforcement notices do not name individuals but they often use references such as "Trader A" or "Manager B" when publishing details of electronic messages or emails to illustrate wrongdoing. Individuals who are identified have a right to respond to the FCA before notices are published, can refer adverse comment to a tribunal and ask the FCA to disclose relevant material. Some lawyers say the legal debate risks disrupting the regulatory process and limiting the FCA's scope to criticise companies. Others say there are bigger issues at stake. "The real concern is not third party rights but the regulators' practice of investigating and settling with the institutions before dealing with any individuals caught up in the case," said Harvey Knight, a lawyer at Withers in London. "Consequently, individuals have to contend with a case that their former employer has already settled with their regulators and the die is cast before these individuals are given any right of reply." Macris was fined almost 800,000 pounds by the FCA in February for failing to be "open and cooperative" with the regulator as losses mounted in the JPMorgan division he oversaw between March and April 2012. Macris, who has spent the last four years trying to clear his name, at the time called the fine a "major climbdown" by the FCA. Bittar, along with five other former traders, faces a criminal trial next September over alleged conspiracy to manipulate Euribor interest rates.

The Financial Conduct Authority asked the Supreme Court to overturn a ruling that it failed to properly hide the identity of Achilles Macris, the former JPMorgan Chase & Co. manager of the so-called London Whale trader, in a settlement with the bank three years ago. If the Macris ruling is upheld, the FCA may have to overhaul how it presents all its reports. For years the FCA has used monikers such as “Trader A” in settlement notices with firms to get around a requirement that a person must be given the chance to respond to allegations if they’re identified. The anonymity allows the agency to illustrate misconduct by publishing real chatroom transcripts that demonstrate the behavior.  "The person who is prejudiced has to be identified,” Jonathan Crow, a lawyer for the FCA, told the five-judge panel Thursday, arguing that Macris was never identified in any regulatory notices. "If a collective label is used, a person has not been identified." Traders have fought back over recent years, claiming the FCA doesn’t go far enough in disguising them. Macris’s lawsuit is one of a number the FCA is facing, but the first to reach the U.K.’s top court. London Whale In Macris’s case, JPMorgan was fined 138 million pounds ($168 million) in 2013 after a trader nicknamed the London Whale incurred $6.2 billion in losses. The FCA referred throughout the notice to “CIO London management,” which Macris contended easily identified him because he was responsible for JPMorgan’s chief investment office in Europe and was based in London. So far, the U.K. courts have agreed with him. "If you use generic phrases like management and senior management and you have to find out from outside the notice what the management structure was, then the notice is not doing the identifying," Crow said. Lawyers for Macris said that he was clearly identified in the notice and that he should’ve been allowed to respond to the FCA’s findings before they were published in the JPMorgan settlement documents. Other traders suing the FCA over the issue include ex-Deutsche Bank AG trader Christian Bittar, who claims he was identifiable in the German lender’s Libor settlement last year, and Julien Grout, another former JPMorgan trader involved in the London Whale case. The issue isn’t necessarily identification, but that regulators settle with banks before dealing with individuals making it difficult to defend their actions, according to Harvey Knight, a London lawyer who isn’t involved in the lawsuit. "The real concern is not third-party rights, but the regulators’ practice of investigating and settling with the institutions before dealing with any individuals caught up in the case," said Knight, a partner at Withers. "Consequently individuals have to contend with a case that their former employer has already settled with their regulators and the die is cast before these individuals are given any right of reply." Macris oversaw JPMorgan’s Chief Investment Office in Europe where trader Bruno Iksil made market-distorting bets on derivatives. Iksil’s bad bets led to more than $900 million in penalties from regulators including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the FCA. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

This round was led by JPMorgan Chase & Co., with ICAP, Barclays and Point72 Ventures. The round also includes individual participation by the principals of several leading trading firms, such as Hudson Ridge Asset Management, who were among Cloud9's early customers. "We are thrilled to welcome Point72 Ventures and our other investors as we continue to build a technology that acts as a catalyst in terms of changing the communication and process around trading," said Gerald Starr, CEO of Cloud9 Technologies. "Cloud9 has ushered trader communication into the modern age, while bringing mobility, enhanced compliance and security, and more agile communication to the industry. With the close of this round, our team is poised to continue development of products and services that will change the way the financial industry and enterprise businesses communicate and collaborate." To date, more than 2,700 users in 29 countries have adopted Cloud9. Firms have cited several reasons for Cloud9's popularity among financial services professionals, including the platform's ease-of-use, mobility features, strong value proposition and interoperability with other solutions. "Cloud9's technology inspired us to revisit our trader voice communication strategy and related workflow," said Rick Smith, Head of Private Investments at JPMorgan Chase. "We believe that Cloud9 will empower traders through its ease of use and management, while improving efficiency, enhancing compliance and reducing communications costs." Cloud9 will use the funding to support innovation, accelerate the development of several products in great demand by its customer base and expand the service offering into new markets. Most recently, Cloud9 opened an office in Singapore to meet growing demand in the Asia Pacific region, and the company has plans to expand operations in other markets by early next year. "The rapid growth of Cloud9 since the company's launch in 2014 has paralleled the industry's adoption of cloud technology and we've seen the opportunity to extend the platform's benefits into areas such as workflow, compliance and advanced analytics," said Richard Kerschner, Chief Corporate Development Officer of ICAP's Post Trade, Risk and Information Services Division."Cloud9 is best positioned to provide next generation solutions that will create improved efficiency and additional benefits for traders, brokers, and other financial market players." ICAP's participation was led by Euclid Opportunities, ICAP's investment arm focused on emerging fintech companies. "We believe Cloud9 is an emerging leader in transforming the way the buy-side and sell-side communicate across the capital markets," said Pete Casella, Partner at Point72 Ventures. "We are excited to partner with Jerry and his team to help attract more of our peers and trading counterparts into the Cloud9 ecosystem." "We have been using Cloud9 since the beginning," said Michael Intrator, President and CEO of Hudson Ridge Asset Management, LLC. "We chose to personally invest in Cloud9 because the technology has been reliable, and transformative for us. We believe that the company has a future that extends beyond creating an integrated lifecycle around trading communications and beyond the finance industry." In July, Cloud9 announced the successful launch of its Gateway Service, which connects Cloud9 users to their counterparties, even if they are not yet using the Cloud9 application. This kind of interoperability gives traders and brokers an edge, allowing them to connect with counterparties that they otherwise might not have had access to via the Cloud9 community. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz served as legal advisor to Cloud9 in connection with the funding round, which commenced earlier in 2016. About Cloud9 Technologies Cloud9 Technologies is a cloud communications service provider that delivers high performance voice and collaboration services designed for the unique functional and compliance needs of institutional traders. The company delivers its services from the cloud using software applications that leverage the Internet and advanced WebRTC technologies.

JPMorgan Chase, Deutsche Bank, Allen & Co., Barclays and Credit Suisse Group reportedly also will play a role. The IPO, expected as early as this spring, could result in a valuation of $25 billion or more. That would make Snap one of the highest-profile IPOs in years. It also would make it the biggest company to go public on an exchange in the United States since 2014, when Alibaba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange placed its value at $168 billion. At its most recent private funding round this spring, Snap's value was pegged at $17.8 billion. The company has projected $250 million to $350 million in revenue for this year and a possible $1 billion in 2017. It appears it already has passed the $350 million revenue mark, however. Last year, Snap reported revenue of $60 million. "An IPO could make sense for Snap and its investors, given the still favorable stock market conditions," said Andreas Scherer, managing partner at Salto Partners. Facebook's Footprints Comparisons to Facebook, which owns competitor Instagram, are "inevitable," Scherer told the E-Commerce Times, but "this is where Snap falls short." Facebook "was a profitable business with an established revenue model based on its ad sales business, and a growth story that promised more traction in the mobile space," he noted. "On both of these fronts, Facebook delivered." On the other hand, Snap "is a VC-backed company that's still losing money," Scherer pointed out. "Some might say that this IPO is the best way for the private equity companies to get their money back before it's too late." An IPO often is inevitable for two reasons, according to a McKinsey report published this spring. First, a company might be forced to go public if it should exceed the maximum number of 2,000 shareholders allowed as a private entity. Second, it might face pressure from shareholders seeking liquidity. IPOs can be effective strategic tools to accelerate growth, the McKinsey report notes. An IPO can provide financing to scale up a business, improve brand credibility, and attract and retain key talent. Assessing Snap's Worth More than 100 million people were accessing Snapchat daily as of this June, according to a Mediakix report, and 8 million videos were published daily on the app. Among the report's other findings: More than 60 percent of smartphone users in the United States aged 13 to 34 used Snapchat in June; Seven out of 10 users were millennials; 85 percent of Snapchat's monthly U.S. users were between 13 and 34 years old; More than 50 percent of new users were 25 years or older; The percentage growth of those 35 years and older was greater than the penetration rate for 18-to-24 year-olds; More than half of Snapchat's users were on the platform daily; 30 percent of teen users considered Snapchat their most important social network; and 60 percent of college-student users said they would purchase from a brand if sent a coupon on Snapchat. All that translates to a great demographic for advertisers, so Snapchat in essence is selling its future promise. Snapchat earlier this year announced Snapchat Partners, its long-awaited ad API that allows third parties to sell ad space on its app. It launched a pilot run with 10 brands. Snap expanded its pilot to more companies this summer. Bad Timing Still, this is "an ugly time" to file an IPO, according to Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group, because of Brexit and the U.S. presidential elections. Both are "likely to cause a lot of fallout," he told the E-Commerce Times, and the market might not settle until 2018. A successful IPO "would likely uplift the social media segment if it wasn't offset by a problem, say Twitter's failure, in the same period," Enderle suggested. "There's too much volatility in the market right now," he said. "Any IPO is a crap shoot, but social media properties, thanks largely to Twitter, are at even greater risk." Richard Adhikari has written about high-tech for leading industry publications since the 1990s and wonders where it's all leading to. Will implanted RFID chips in humans be the Mark of the Beast?

General Electric: What To Do If The Stock Drops Next Time (Seeking Alpha) On October 14, three big banks, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC) and Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C) will kick-start the earnings season for the financial sector. Interestingly, all three companies have delivered either positive EPS surprises or in-line expectations in the last two quarters of the current year. There are at least two factors investors will be looking for from these companies. The first one is their outlook for the year ahead, and the second is the prospect of a rate hike, which is expected in December by most economists. Argus pointed out that the financial sector suffered over 4 percent in the current year compared to the overall market. One of the primary reasons is the rate hike schedule, which was disappointing. The Brexit vote also played its part in hurting the financial segment, injecting ambiguity into world banking performances.

However, investors' sentiments remained negative ahead of the results, with the stocks trading down. The following companies will report their third quarter results on October 14: Citigroup: The Street sees EPS of $1.16 and revenue of $17.34 billion. JPMorgan: Analysts expect $1.39 EPS on revenue of $23.99 billion. Wells Fargo: The Street is looking for an EPS of $1.01 on $22.22 billion in revenue. The following banks are scheduled to release their results next week: Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC): The Street sees the company to deliver $0.33 EPS and revenue of $20.94 billion when the company announces its results on October 17. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS): The company will reveal its results on October 18. Analysts expect EPS of $3.79 and $7.42 billion revenue. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS): The Street expects the company to generate $8.16 billion revenue to earn $0.63 EPS as the company would disclose its results on October 19. At Last Check: Bank of America was down 1.03 percent at $15.86. Citigroup was down 0.29 percent at $48.57. Goldman Sachs was down 1.23 percent at $167.41. JPMorgan was down 0.53 percent at $67.76.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 13, 2016 2:19pm   Comments Share: The third-quarter earnings season focus shifts to three of the nation’s largest banks, which report results ahead of the bell Friday and are, to many traders, the real start of the period. First up are JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C) and the beleaguered Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC). As a group, the big banks aren’t expected to rock Wall Street’s expectations, as the industry continues to wrestle with regulatory issues and shrinking profits amid this low-interest rate environment. While the trading climate for big banks appears to have improved, the fundamentals don’t look as robust as some would like, according to analysts. Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at CFRA Research, expects flat Q3 net interest income, noninterest income and total revenues, but he expects an improvement from the declines of previous quarters, he said in a research note. “Planned reductions continue to affect C’s revenues, but the rest of the large banks will likely show some year-over-year revenue growth,” he wrote. The key word here is “some,” which, according to Wall Street’s forecasts, won’t be much. The Firestorm at WFC Let’s take a look at the first of the three, WFC, which has been mired in controversy and widespread criticism over a sham customer account scandal that broke in September. The bank agreed last month to pay $185 million in fines for illegally opening millions of accounts for unsuspecting customers. Thousands of employees were let go over the scandal, and CEO John Stumpf was put on the defensive, appearing twice before Congressional committees, which took him to task over company practices. On Wednesday, only two days before the bank’s Q3 earnings and investor conference call, Stumpf unexpectedly sent a letter to his board announcing he would retire immediately, according to a number of published reports. On Friday, Timothy Sloan, WFC’s president and chief operating officer, will man the conference call as the new CEO. Investors likely want to know what’s next. How will WFC handle operations going forward? How much has this scandal cost the bank in fines, in any remaining obligations, in lost revenues and business, in lost market capitalization and reputation? What is left to be done to meet new regulatory investigations, including a Labor Dept. probe into retaliation against whistleblowers? What is the effect on the bank’s business model, and is there more fallout ahead? And how will WFC regain trust with customers and rebuild business in the retail bank? That’s all forward-looking information and doesn’t even take much of Q3’s results into account. Analysts reporting to Thomson Reuters are pegging a per-share profit of $1.01 on revenues of $22.2 billion. That’s about flat to the year-ago results as well as the Q2. Short-term options traders have priced in a potential 2% share price move in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator on the thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. Ahead of earnings, traders were mostly focusing on the 46-strike calls and the 45-strike puts. The implied volatility is relatively high at the 40th percentile. (Please remember past performance is no guarantee of future results.)

Fewer Flames at JPM When JPM reports results ahead of the bell, analysts may be more interested in how Chief Executive Jamie Dimon is reading the consumer tea leaves for the fourth quarter and beyond than for the results from the previous quarter. Last quarter, JPM handily outpaced Wall Street’s expectations and its stock price has risen about 7% since then, though it has traded in a fairly tight range in recent weeks. How likely is a repeat performance? The Q2 earnings were powered partly by trading activity and loan growth, and some analysts say they don’t expect a repeat of that in the Q3. “Trading revenues are likely to improve, primarily driven by higher fixed-income trading, but may compare unfavorably with the big jump in the second quarter caused by Brexit-induced uncertainty,” according to the Nasdaq site. Low interest rates have likely been a hindrance to loan origination and, as they are for many financial institutions, a drag on revenues and profits. For the quarter, analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see, on average, profit of $1.40 per share on top line sales of $23.9 billion. That’s well off the year-ago earnings of $1.68 a share, though sales are a bit higher than last year’s $23.5 billion. Short-term options traders have priced in a slim 1.87% share price move in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator. Options trading has been slow, with calls at the 68.5 strike and puts at the 67- and 67.5-strike points. The implied volatility is at the 22nd percentile. Few Sparks May Flicker at C Wall Street is forecasting the third straight drop in earnings and revenue for C, but the bank group may see an uptick in its U.S. credit-card business tied to its new partnership with Costco. Strength in C’s currencies and interest-rate trading businesses were up in the “mid-single digits” percentage range, C’s chief financial officer said last month, according to published reports. But investment banking was running a “little lighter than we had estimated,” he added. C may also report higher than expected expenses linked to the recently announced four-year, $1.5 billion investment in its Mexico operations. To that end, Thomson Reuters analysts are looking for $1.16 a share profit on revenues of $17.3 billion. Last year at this time, C turned in $1.35 a share earnings on sales of $18.5 billion. Short-term options traders have priced in a 2.7% share price move in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move™ indicator. Options trading has been active at the 50-strike calls and the 47.5-strike puts. The implied volatility is at the 22nd percentile.

When the big U.S. banks report earnings over the next four business days, investors and analysts will focus on three things: loan growth, expenses and activity in the capital markets. Third-quarter earnings season begins in earnest this Friday as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo are set to post results before the bell. Given banks' involvement in many aspects of overall business activity, their earnings are watched as an indicator of U.S. economic growth. "I think you're going to learn a lot about the strength of the U.S. economy tomorrow," said Marc Chaikin, CEO of Chaikin Analytics. "You'll get a feel for the housing market based on what they're saying about mortgage applications," he said. Bank of America is set to report next Monday, followed by Goldman Sachs next Tuesday and Morgan Stanley next Wednesday. All eyes on Wells Fargo However, Wells Fargo's quarterly report this Friday will likely take the immediate spotlight as the bank struggles to recover from a consumer sales scandal and continued scrutiny from authorities. John Stumpf retired as chairman and CEO of the bank Wednesday, but not all analysts are convinced the succession of well-liked Tim Sloan to the position of CEO will be enough to restore confidence in the bank. "The main thing is, how management handles the call and how they describe the ramifications of the account scandal, how they reset expectations for fee income and how they grow the business," said Kevin Barker, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray, which reiterated an underweight rating and $43 price target on Wells in a Thursday note. "The big question is, how does this affect people wanting to walk in the door and get an account at Wells?" Barker said. The bank paid $185 million in penalties for opening possibly 2 million consumer deposit and credit card accounts without customer authorization. Where the sector stands now For banks overall, analysts are watching loan growth as a gauge of the economic health of businesses and consumers. "I think loan growth will really make or (break) the quarter for the bank sector," said Kelly Bogdanov, vice president and portfolio analyst at RBC Wealth Management. She expects solid loan growth in commercial and consumer real estate, and good levels of consumer lending in general. "What we need to see is the economy continue to grow for the banks to continue to have loan growth," she said. show chapters <p>Wasserstrom: Macro continues to weigh on bank earnings</p> <p>Discussing the fallout for Wells Fargo as well as what to expect from third quarter bank earnings with Eric Wasserstrom, Guggenheim Securities, and Paul Miller, FBR Capital Markets.</p> Wasserstrom: Macro continues to weigh on bank earnings    Thursday, 13 Oct 2016 | 10:37 AM ET | 04:29 Another issue investors are watching in this post-financial crisis era is how the banks deal with regulation and any settlements that may come along. Banks will need to show they have enough capital on hand to pay for any potential charges, although most analysts are confident the firms are in good shape. "I'm sure (regulation will) come up and people will ask for their insights on it," said Jeffery Harte, principal, Sandler O'Neill Partners. However, he said, "the underlying message will remain, the big banks have a lot of capital, the big banks have a lot of cash and they'll probably manage pretty well." Harte has a hold rating on Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase, and a buy on Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup. "We expect sluggish investment banking results with modest declines year over year and double-digit declines quarter over quarter. Increased volatility has dampened the revenue outlook for mergers and acquisitions and equity capital markets." -Macquarie analysts, in a research note For these investment banks, figures on trading and corporate deal activity will stand as important indicators on the health of financial markets. The third quarter, which includes the summer holidays, is often slower than other quarters of the year. "We expect sluggish investment banking results with modest declines year over year and double-digit declines quarter over quarter," Macquarie analysts said in a Wednesday note. "Increased volatility has dampened the revenue outlook for mergers and acquisitions and equity capital markets," the latter of which includes companies' initial public offerings. Guidance for capital markets activity will be particularly of interest, since IPO and corporate deal activity picked up at the end of the third quarter, after 2016 started sluggishly. I'm "looking to see whether there are continued signs of momentum into year-end," said Devin Ryan, analyst at JMP Securities, which has a market perform rating on Goldman Sachs a market outperform rating on Morgan Stanley. "The market's been a bit more resilient recently than earlier in the year," he said. The value of global mergers and acquisitions, excluding spinoffs, was about $860.6 billion in this year's third quarter, up from roughly $736.6 billion in the first quarter, but down from around $1.1 trillion in the third quarter last year, according to Dealogic. Renaissance Capital expects 30 to 40 more IPOs for the rest of the year, putting 2016 on track for more than 100 deals raising a total of more than $16 billion, according to a Sept. 30 note from the firm. But many challenges for the IPO market may arise in the next few months, given the presidential election, the usual trading slowdown around the holidays and a potential interest rate hike, Renaissance said. "Even at the high end of our estimates, the 2016 U.S. IPO market will go down as the least active year since the financial crisis and will most likely trail both 2008 and 2009 in terms of proceeds raised," the note said. Over the last three months, financials themselves are the second-best performers in the S&P 500. But the sector has struggled the whole year with moderate economic growth, lowered expectations for a U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike and one of the worst starts to a year for the U.S. stock market.

Ogg October 10, 2016 1:31 pm EST Print Email Tweet Noble Midstream Partners L.P. (NYSE: NBLX) has received mostly positive analyst coverage upon the expiration of its quiet period. This is not unusual to see more Buy or Outperform rating after an initial public offering. Noble Midstream Partners is a master limited partnership which was formed by Noble to own oil and gas gathering assets in Colorado’s DJ basin. It raised some $281 million after selling some 12.5 million units at $22.50 per unit. Its indicated price range was $19.00 to $21.00. Barclays, Baird, JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, DNB Markets, Mizuho Securities, Mitsubishi UFJ Securities and Wells Fargo Securities were in the underwriting syndicate. Deutsche Bank Securities started coverage with a Hold rating, issuing a $29 price target. These were the following Buy and Outperform types of ratings we have seen so far on Monday: Barclays started it as Overweight with a $35 price target. Citigroup started it as Buy with a $33.50 price target. JPMorgan started it as Overweight with a $34 price target. Mizuho started it as Buy and with a $33 price target. Robert W. Baird started it as Outperform with a $39 price target. A report from MUFG’s US Equity Research team issued an Overweight rating and assigned a $32 price target. That report said: We are initiating coverage on Noble Midstream Partners with an Overweight rating and a $32 price target, which implies a one-year IRR of 21.7%. We think the partnership’s existing asset base, which includes midstream service acreage dedications, coupled with its drop-down growth prospects provide a strong valuation upside with lower-than-average cash-flow risk compared with the broader midstream sector. In addition, NBLX launched its IPO with a completely unlevered balance sheet and $350M of liquidity, which provides several avenues with which to fund growth. The cash-flow stability and visibility offered by the partnership’s healthy relationship with its producer-sponsor results in limited downside for NBLX, in our opinion. We would also point out that a recent filing showed that Tortoise Capital recently reported a 13.4% passive stake in Noble Midstream Partners. That was as of September 30, and was for the firm’s funds. Noble Midstream Partners was up by 2.8% at $28.50, and the post-IPO range has been $26.00 to $28.99. If 24/7 Wall St. uses the seven available price targets shown here, the consensus analyst price target would be $33.64.

Morgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C) ahead of earnings this Friday, says TheStreet's Jim Cramer. JPMorgan Chase overtook Wells Fargo as the largest U.S. bank by market capitalization in September, at $248.3 billion, after Wells shares sank amid a bogus accounts scandal.

CItigroup may report higher-than expected-expenses in the third quarter after announcing a four-year, $1.5 billion investment in Mexico in October.

JPMorgan Chase & Co, Deutsche Bank AG, Allen & Co, Barclays Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG will be joint book runners, the source said, asking not to be named because the information was not yet public. Snapchat, whose parent is Snap Inc, and the banks were not immediately available to comment on the news first reported by Bloomberg News. Snapchat started in 2012 as a free mobile app that allows users to send photos that vanish within seconds. It has more than 100 million active users, about 60 percent of whom are aged 13 to 24, making it an attractive way for advertisers to reach millennials. Awash in venture funding, the company raised $1.81 billion in May, which valued it at about $20 billion, media reports said at the time. But investors worry that Snapchat’s advertising sales, which began last October, is the company’s only significant revenue source. Snap in September starting describing itself as a camera company. Its first physical product will be glasses with an embedded video camera. Users will be able to record video from their perspective in 10-second increments, which can be synched with their smartphones. The company’s last round of funding included General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital, T. Rowe Price and Lone Pine. Previous rounds included Fidelity Investment, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Yahoo! Inc. The U.S. IPO market has been unfriendly to technology companies for most of 2016. Year to date, technology IPOs have raised roughly $2.3 billion, compared to $5.2 billion over the same period in 2015. But a recent string of such IPOs has instilled more confidence among investors.

 Microsoft Wallet is adding Chase support BI Intelligence Oct. 13, 2016, 12:30 AM 2,384 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also Citi has unveiled its own mobile wallet called Citi Pay Apple Pay web users can get exclusive offers Here's how Mobile Order & Pay could lift Starbucks This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. JPMorgan Chase reportedly plans to begin supporting Microsoft Wallet, Microsoft's mobile wallet, in 2017, according to a tweet from Chase Support. With the addition of Chase, Microsoft Wallet will be supported by a number of high profile banks, including Bank of America, PNC Bank, and US Bank, giving it access to a large user base in order to compete with other major carriers. Microsoft Wallet is adding major banks likely as part of a move to expand, but intense competition and shrinking market share could pose challenges.  Adding Chase could help spark adoption for the wallet. With the addition of Chase, four out of the top six largest US banks by assets will support Microsoft Wallet. These partnerships are important for Microsoft, as they allow the company to reach a larger user base that increasingly wants more mobile payment capabilities. This could result in more consumers buying Microsoft Wallet compatible phones and in turn becomes appealing to more customers of participating banks. Even with the addition of a major bank, Microsoft Wallet faces major hurdles.  Windows Phone holds a very small share of the smartphone market. In Q2 of 2016, Windows smartphone sales represented only 0.6% of the market, down nearly 2% from the previous year, according to Gartner. That means, even if the Microsoft Wallet is popular amongst users, its unlikely to reach enough people to make much of an impact. Conventional wisdom would also suggest that the Microsoft Wallet could eventually come to desktops and even potentially Xbox, which would reach a much larger audience considering these two channels' popularity.  Microsoft is far behind mobile wallet competitors. Apple, Google, and Samsung, who own the largest share of smartphone sales, have all launched mobile wallets that include rewards and loyalty programs, in addition to both on- and offline payment capabilities. Not only does Microsoft have to compete with major carriers, it has to compete with the increasing amount of major retailers that have adopted their own mobile wallets, such as Wal-Mart, Starbucks, and Target. Mobile payments are becoming more popular. But they still face some high barriers, such as consumers' continued loyalty to traditional payment methods and fragmented acceptance among merchants. But as loyalty programs are integrated and more consumers rely on their mobile wallets for other features like in-app payments, adoption and usage will surge over the next few years. Evan Bakker, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile payments that forecasts the growth of in-store mobile payments in the U.S., analyzes the performance of major mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay, and addresses the barriers holding mobile payments back as well as the benefits that will propel adoption. Here are some key takeaways from the report: In our latest US in-store mobile payments forecast, we find that volume will reach $75 billion this year. We expect volume to pick up significantly by 2020, reaching $503 billion. This reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 80% between 2015 and 2020. Consumer interest is the primary barrier to mobile payments adoption. Surveys indicate that the issue is less the mobile wallet itself and more that people remain loyal to traditional payment methods and show little enthusiasm for picking up new habits. Integrated loyalty programs and other add-on features will be key to mobile wallets taking off. Consumers are showing interest in wallets with integrated loyalty programs. Other potential add-ons, like in-app, in-browser, and P2P payments, will also start fueling adoption. This strategy has been proved successful in China with platforms like WeChat and Alipay.

Low rates, global challenges confound banks USA TODAY 10/12/2016 Roger Yu © AP A customer uses a Wells Fargo bank ATM in New York Wells Fargo (WFC), reeling from a widespread scandal that attracted ire from lawmakers, will draw attention again Friday as it reports quarterly profit results.  Quotes in the article JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▲ 76.69 +0.04 +0.05% Wells Fargo & Co WFC ▲ 51.73 +0.10 +0.19% Citigroup Inc C ▼ 52.83 -0.78 -1.46% JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C) are also reporting third-quarter earnings Friday. But bank stock investors will be paying particular attention to Wells Fargo’s losses from and plans to address the “cross-selling” scandal that has rocked the San Francisco-based company. Its employees allegedly created upwards of 2 million phony accounts without customers' consent, triggering federal investigations, congressional inquiries and lost business.   The banks’ financial statements and executives’ conference calls also will be parsed for the effects of lingering global challenges — such as Brexit, the sluggish European economy, Deutsche Bank’s recent woes and the rising Libor interest rate — that cloud otherwise resilient domestic economic conditions. The overall picture will undoubtedly be part of the calculation used by Federal Reserve policy makers looking to possibly raise interest rates in December for the first time this year.  "During the third quarter, banks faced another challenging operating environment, with uncertainty and volatility arising after the Brexit vote and lackluster global economic growth continued," Brian Kleinhanzl, an industry analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods wrote in a recent note to investors.  Parsing Wells Fargo Those seeking to gauge the extent of the damage for Wells Fargo from its actions will have a clearer picture Friday as its executives are expected to lay out their going-forward plans. To manage expectations, its top executives, led by CEO John Stumpf, held an hour-long call with about 500 senior executives Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported.  The executives were assured efforts by some states to suspend some business with the bank “weren’t having much effect,” the WSJ reported. The bank is still reporting growth in new checking accounts even as the growth rate slowed, COO Timothy Sloan is reported to have said. "To say the last month has been difficult is an understatement," Sloan said. “It’s going to be harder for a while, and we get that.” In a recent KBW podcast, Kleinhanzl said he estimates the bank could lose about $400 million in both 2017 and 2018 “due to friction” stemming from the scandal.  Wells Fargo's earnings per share for the third quarter are estimated to fall 4% to $1.01, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.  Slowing loan growth  Low interest rates have helped fuel the mortgage market, one of the brighter spots for the bank sector. But bank revenues also have been pressured by the narrow spread in the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The banks still managed to eke out a 1.4% year-over-year earnings growth in the second quarter, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Consumer loans and other businesses compensated for the narrow interest rates spread. But sluggish demand for commercial and industrial loans remains a concern for analysts as banks want to make up for the interest income squeeze with greater loan volume. Commercial and industrial loans were flat in the third quarter compared to the previous quarter, according to data from the Federal Reserve last week.  A slow commercial loan growth rate in the third quarter is due largely to “seasonal softness” in auto dealership business, tepid manufacturing activity in summer months, weak corporate acquisition activity and the energy’s industry ongoing troubles, Brian Klock, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said in a podcast.  Brexit concerns could also be keeping some companies from borrowing as they keep their plans on hold while Britain considers details of its exit from the European Union.  Global investors are also spooked by Deutsche Bank’s woes, with some even comparing it to the early dramas of Lehman Brothers, a large U.S. brokerage firm that crumbled in 2008 and set off the financial crisis. The German behemoth saw its investment banking business plummet this year and its market value cut about half as it faces a multibillion-dollar fine from U.S. regulators for its role in the events that led to the 2008 financial crisis. It’s also accused of manipulating the Libor in 2012.  “What happens in Europe doesn’t stay in Europe,” Kleinhanzl said.

In addition, Carle expects to issue $50 million of series 2016B taxable variable rate demand bonds. Proceeds from the series 2016 financing will be used to finance construction of new facilities, refund Carle's series 2009D variable rate demand revenue bonds and pay the costs of issuance. The series 2016A bonds will be issued as long-term fixed rate obligations and are expected to sell via negotiated sale the week of Oct. 24. In addition, Fitch has affirmed the 'AA-' long-term rating on the following revenue bonds issued by the authority on behalf of Carle: --$234.7 million series 2011A; --$7.9 million series 2009A; --$160 million series 2009B-E*. *Underlying rating. The bonds are supported by bank letters-of-credit issued by The Northern Trust Company or JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Rating Outlook is Stable. SECURITY Debt payments secured by a security interest in the gross receipts of the Obligated Group (OG; which includes the Carle Foundation, the Carle Foundation Hospital, Carle Health Care, Inc. and Carle Retirement Centers, Inc.). There is no mortgage or property pledge or debt service reserve fund. The OG represents approximately 48% of total system revenues and 77% of total system assets. KEY RATING DRIVERS FINANCIALLY STRONG, INTEGRATED SYSTEM: Fitch views as a credit strength Carle's fully integrated clinical model that includes a tertiary hospital, a large base of employed physicians, and a health plan. Despite recent softening in operating profitability due to losses within the health plan, unrestricted liquidity at June 30th remains solid at approximately $1.2 billion equating to 159% of pro forma debt. MANAGEABLE PRO FORMA DEBT BURDEN: Pro forma debt metrics, including the impact of the 2016 borrowing, are supportive of the rating. Pro forma MADS to total revenues of 1.7% compares favorably to the 'AA' category median of 2.2% for the six-month 2016 interim period. Despite compressed profitability in fiscal 2015 and through the six-month interim period, historical coverage of pro forma MADS of 4.6x and 4.1x, respectively, is adequate given Carle's market position and integrated delivery model. LEADING MARKET SHARE: Carle has further extended its leading inpatient market share position to 46.8% in 2016 from 46.3% in 2015 in its primary service area of Champaign-Urbana. Carle's market share has grown every year since 2002. In addition, most of Carle's patient volume numbers continue to show growth. CONTINUED CAPITAL SPENDING: Fitch expects capital expenditures to remain above 1x depreciation, as Carle continues to execute on its five-year capital plan. Favorably, the majority of planned projects are expected to be revenue-enhancing and no additional debt is currently planned, apart from the series 2016 borrowing. RATING SENSITIVITIES CONTINUED STRENGTH IN PERFORMANCE: Fitch expects operating performance at the Health Alliance Medical Plan (HAMP) to improve with the decision to exit the Managed Medicaid business by the end of 2016. The improvement in insurance operations combined with steady operating performance at the Carle Foundation hospitals should allow the system to move back towards financial performance more consistent with historical results. CREDIT SUMMARY Located in Urbana, IL, Carle Foundation consists of 393-bed Carle Foundation Hospital, Carle Health Care, Incorporated (which includes Carle Physician Group, comprised mostly of former Clinic physicians), Carle Retirement Centers, a 174-unit retirement center d/b/a The Windsor, and a health plan. Fitch's credit analysis is based on the results of the consolidated entity, which includes Health Alliance Medical Plans, Inc. (HAMP), a non-obligated health insurer licensed in the State of Illinois. In fiscal 2016, HAMP accounted for roughly 69% of the $2.5 billion in consolidated operating revenues. SOLID CREDIT PROFILE The 'AA-' rating reflects the strategic benefit of Carle's integrated delivery model, its growing market share position and its stable financial profile over the last few years. In 2015, on a fully consolidated basis, Carle generated income from operations of $32.7 million on total revenues of $2.5 billion (1.3% margin). Through the six months ended June 30, 2016, Carle generated operating income of $26.5 million on revenues of $1.3 billion, improving operating margin to 2.1%. On an OG-only basis, Carle generated an operating margin of 6.83% in 2015 and 9.51% in the six-month interim period. Though solid, consolidated operating margins in both fiscal 2015 and the six-month interim period of 2016 were weaker than the 5% operating margin Carle posted in fiscal 2014. Additionally, days cash on hand slipped to 173.4 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from 194.8 in fiscal 2015 and 231.3 in fiscal 2014. The biggest source of weakness in these two ratios came from HAMP, which is experiencing compressed operations due mainly to delayed payments from the State of Illinois, which remains without a budget. Approximately 47% of HAMP's premium revenues come from state insurance contracts. Management has taken proactive steps to counteract the effects of these delayed payments and shore up its operations and liquidity position. To bolster its operating margin, Carle plans to exit its Managed Medicaid business by January 2017. Carle also continues to sell its state receivables aged 90 days or more to continue to grow its liquidity position. Fitch therefore expects liquidity and profitability to improve. LIQUIDITY GROWTH At June 30, 2016, Carle had unrestricted cash and investments of approximately $1.2 billion, up from just under $1.1 billion at year-end 2013. Cushion ratio of 26.6% as of June 30, 2016 compares favorably to Fitch's 'AA'-rated median. Current cash-to-debt is also a comfortable 215.7% as of the six-month interim, but this ratio declines to 159.2% when the new money debt is factored in. The strong overall growth in unrestricted cash and investments helps offset concerns about the state of Illinois' delayed payments to HAMP. SOLID MARKET POSITION Carle has further increased its leading inpatient market share in its primary service area of Champaign County over the last six years to 46.8% in 2016 from 39.1% in 2010. Presence Covenant has the second-largest market share position at 16.7%, and that has fallen from 20.1% in 2010. Carle remains the market leader in key clinical lines, such as neurosciences, heart and vascular, oncology and women's services. Regionally, Carle continues to extend its reach through growth of clinical alignments with smaller, regional hospitals and expanding outpatient sites. HAMP also has a strong regional presence, and Carle and HAMP continue to explore regional business opportunities, as well as other potential initiatives around health care reform, including its ability to manage care coordination and control costs. HAMP has expanded into Washington State and Iowa, as well. CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS Collective proceeds from both a portion of the series 2016A bonds and a portion of the series 2016B taxable bonds will be used to finance construction of several projects that Carle identified in its five-year capital improvement plan. Major projects include a sports and orthopedic medicine center, expansion to administrative spaces for both Carle and HAMP, as well as clinical expansions at various sites. Total project costs are estimated at $200 million and will be entirely funded from the proceeds of the 2016 borrowings. DEBT STRUCTURE/BURDEN Including the net new money debt from the 2016 borrowings, Carle's pro forma long-term debt will total approximately $715 million. Following these transactions, Carle will have approximately 61% of fixed-rate debt and 39% variable rate debt. Of the variable-rate debt, approximately $160 million is letter of credit (LOC) supported and the remaining is bank loans. Expiration dates on the LOC's and bank loans range from 2019 to 2024, with no more than two expiring on any one date. Carle has four swaps in place - two fixed payor swaps and two basis swaps. Total notional value of the swaps is $192 million. There are four counterparties, which provides for good counterparty diversity as it limits exposure to any single counterparty. The collateral thresholds on the swaps range from $15 million to $20 million and Carle has never had to post collateral. The mark-to-market on the swaps is negative $22.1 million at June 30, 2016. Pro forma leverage metrics have moderated over the historical period and are manageable at the current rating level. Following the 2016 transactions, MADS will increase from $38 million to $43 million. In the six-month interim, pro forma MADS coverage was a solid 4.1x. DISCLOSURE Carle covenants to disclose annual financial information within 150 days of each fiscal year-end and quarterly information within 50 days of each fiscal quarter-end to EMMA. Disclosure to date has been excellent and includes both consolidated and consolidating balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flows, as well as management discussion and analysis.

(Photo: AP) Wells Fargo (WFC), reeling from a widespread scandal that attracted ire from lawmakers and cost its CEO his job, will face a barrage of questions again Friday as it reports quarterly profit results. JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C) are also reporting third-quarter earnings Friday. But bank stock investors will be paying particular attention to Wells Fargo as the company elaborates on Chairman and CEO John Stumpf's sudden departure Wednesday and the extent of the losses from and plans to address the “cross-selling” scandal that has rocked the San Francisco-based company. Its employees allegedly created upwards of 2 million phony accounts without customers' consent, triggering federal investigations, congressional inquiries and lost business. The large banks’ financial statements and executives’ conference calls also will be parsed for the effects of lingering global challenges — such as Brexit, the sluggish European economy, Deutsche Bank’s recent woes and the rising Libor interest rate — that cloud otherwise resilient domestic economic conditions. The overall picture will undoubtedly be part of the calculation used by Federal Reserve policy makers looking to possibly raise interest rates in December for the first time this year. "During the third quarter, banks faced another challenging operating environment, with uncertainty and volatility arising after the Brexit vote and lackluster global economic growth continued," Brian Kleinhanzl, an industry analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote in a recent note to investors. Parsing Wells Fargo Stumpf's surprising departure — he had insisted on staying even after some critics, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, called for his resignation — thickens the plot for Wells Fargo investors, who will want to hear reassuring words and concrete strategy from Stumpf's immediate replacement, COO Timothy Sloan. To manage expectations, Stumpf and Sloan held an hour-long call with about 500 senior executives Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported. Sloan, who was named CEO and elected to the board Wednesday, will now field questions from Wall Street largely on his own. During the internal conference call, Wells Fargo executives were assured that efforts by some states to suspend some business with the bank “weren’t having much effect,” the WSJ reported. The bank is still reporting growth in new checking accounts even as the growth rate slowed, Sloan is reported to have said. "To say the last month has been difficult is an understatement," Sloan said. “It’s going to be harder for a while, and we get that.” In a recent KBW podcast, Kleinhanzl said he estimates the bank could lose about $400 million in both 2017 and 2018 “due to friction” stemming from the scandal. Wells Fargo's earnings per share for the third quarter are estimated to have fallen 4% to $1.01, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. USA TODAY Chicago cuts off Wells Fargo for a year Slowing loan growth Low interest rates have helped fuel the mortgage market, one of the brighter spots for the bank sector. But bank revenues also have been pressured by the narrow spread in the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The banks still managed to eke out a 1.4% year-over-year earnings growth in the second quarter, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Consumer loans and other businesses compensated for the narrow interest rates spread. But sluggish demand for commercial and industrial loans remains a concern for analysts as banks want to make up for the interest income squeeze with greater loan volume. Commercial and industrial loans were flat in the third quarter compared with the previous quarter, according to data from the Federal Reserve last week. A slow commercial loan growth rate in the third quarter is due largely to “seasonal softness” in auto dealership business, tepid manufacturing activity in summer months, weak corporate acquisition activity and the energy’s industry ongoing troubles, Brian Klock, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said in a podcast. Brexit concerns could also be keeping some companies from borrowing as they keep their plans on hold while Britain considers details of its exit from the European Union. USA TODAY Is Deutsche Bank the next Lehman moment? Global investors are also spooked by Deutsche Bank’s woes, with some even comparing it to the early dramas of Lehman Bros., a large U.S. brokerage firm that crumbled in 2008 and set off the financial crisis. The German behemoth saw its investment banking business plummet this year and its market value cut about half as it faces a multibillion-dollar fine from U.S. regulators for its role in the events that led to the 2008 financial crisis. It’s also accused of manipulating the Libor in 2012. “What happens in Europe doesn’t stay in Europe,” Kleinhanzl said.

Roz Edward, Michigan Chronicle Managing Editor Leave a comment The Great Lakes Women’s Business Council is pleased to announce it has received a $320,000 grant from JPMorgan Chase. These funds will support the Detroit Business Growth Initiative, an innovative program to grow existing certified businesses in Detroit-specifically advanced certifications for minority women and veteran-certified businesses. The grant is part of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s $100 million, five-year commitment to Detroit’s economic recovery. Launched in 2014, the investment in Detroit focuses on community development, blight mitigation, job skills training, small business promotion and other economic growth initiatives. The Detroit Business Growth Initiative addresses the priority of accelerating small business growth. There are approximately 32,000 minority-owned small businesses in Detroit, according to the U.S. Census, which makes Detroit the fourth largest U.S. city for the number of minority-owned businesses. Small businesses require three elements to be sustainable: capital, capacity and customers. There are several organizations in Detroit addressing capital and capacity. What has not been a focus is connecting small businesses to contract opportunities through major corporations and government entities. “Small businesses are the backbone of our economy in Detroit and, together, we can do more to not only improve their chance to succeed but also reduce unemployment in the city and expand opportunity for all,” says Tosha Tabron, Relationship Manager for Global Philanthropy at JPMorgan Chase & Co. “By investing in this program, we are improving access to customers and that’s the best way to help them grow their businesses.” The program, which is expected to create 25 new jobs, leverage $500,000 in financing and increase sales by 35% on average, will provide expert led training and coaching to connect existing Detroit-based businesses to contract opportunities in the corporate and government arenas. Participants will have access to our 20+ years’ experience in procurement and certification along with 30+ years of relationships and small business loan programs. The Detroit Business Growth Initiative will feature a series of trainings, individual counseling and coaching streamlined to help participants fully utilize certifications, capital and contract opportunities. “Detroit small businesses deserve the best we have to give.  We are providing all of our business growth skills and experience as well as our relationships with 100+ corporations interested in doing business with certified business owners.  These Detroit businesses will accelerate their growth”, says Michelle Richards, Great Lakes WBC Executive Director.

Rowe Price Group Inc. and Invesco Ltd. are getting ready to start buying one of the corporate-bond market’s biggest laggards. Bank bonds have high yields relative to riskier securities and are safe havens in a market where some fund managers are growing less comfortable with valuations broadly, said Jacob Habibi, a senior credit analyst at Invesco, which oversees $820 billion in assets. The U.S. stock market has fallen about 1 percent this week, and some investors are bracing for corporate bonds to weaken. U.S. banks started posting earnings on Friday and often sell debt after releasing results. “As U.S. banks’ earnings come in, it may make sense to buy new bank debt," Habibi said on Friday. “Today’s results mark a clear improvement in banks’ fixed-income trading and energy lending” and improving profitability should help bank bonds perform better, he said. Some investors are shying away from the debt. So far this year, financial bonds maturing between five and 10 years have risen just 6.8 percent, trailing the 9.4 percent gains for industrial bonds with similar duration and the 8.6 percent increase for similar-duration investment-grade corporates overall, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Index data show. The gap between yields for banks and industrial companies is close to its widest in more than three years. But over the rest of this year, bank bonds could perform in line with overall investment-grade corporate bonds or better, said Steven Boothe, a money manager at T. Rowe Price Group Inc., which oversees $777 billion. Boothe said he’s looking at buying bank bonds after they release earnings. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. kicked off third-quarter earnings on Friday by posting stronger-than-expected results, buoyed by a rise in bond-trading revenue, while Wells Fargo & Co. saw profit drop 2.6 percent as expenses climbed and the bank set aside more money for soured loans. Next week, Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley are due to report. "Bank bonds are cheap -- I think they’re really attractive," Michael Collins, a money manager at Prudential Financial Inc.’s fixed income unit, said Friday on Bloomberg TV. "That’s been the trade for a long time. The senior debt, even the subordinated debt of the banks is really safe, they have pristine credit quality. The equity has been the challenge." ‘Net Positive’ Federal Reserve officials expect to hike rates by a quarter percentage point this year, according to materials the central bank released last month. Small rate increases can allow banks to raise the interest they charge on long-term loans, without usually forcing them to lift the rates they pay depositors, resulting in higher profit. "Modestly rising interest rates should be a net positive for U.S. banks and their bonds," said David Brown, head of global investment-grade credit at Neuberger Berman, which oversees $246 billion of assets. Bank bonds were among the strongest performers in the corporate debt market in 2015. One reason they have lagged this year is that big financial holding companies are issuing more debt to comply with new regulations known as Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity rules. Some banks could sell more TLAC debt after posting earnings, said T. Rowe Price’s Boothe. Preferred Equity Other investors are looking at banks’ riskier securities, such as subordinated bonds or preferred shares. There are more than $10 trillion of bonds in Europe and Asia with negative yields, and fund managers in those regions that are starved for yield may grow more interested in riskier bank instruments in the future. "You can make an argument for some bank debt down the capital structure including subordinated and preferred securities relative to high-quality junk debt," said Jeff Cucunato, head of U.S. investment-grade credit at BlackRock Inc., which has $4.9 trillion under management. Any strength in the economy could help as well, said Mark Kiesel, chief investment officer for global credit at Pacific Investment Management Co., which has $1.5 trillion under management. The firm has a higher proportion of its portfolio in bank debt than its index does. "Bank debt is a pure play of the economy, and the U.S. economy is going to modestly pick up," Kiesel said.

(Mark Kauzlarich/Bloomberg) Investor pessimism pummels banking shares as U.S. stocks falter Add to ... Dani Burger Bloomberg News Published Thursday, Oct. 13, 2016 2:28PM EDT Last updated Thursday, Oct. 13, 2016 2:55PM EDT Comments AA It’s going to take more than solid earnings growth to lure investors into financial shares. Undeterred by forecasts that project lenders growing third-quarter profits the most among S&P 500 Index industries, retail investors extended withdrawals from an exchange-traded fund tracking the group to the longest stretch of the bull market, while options traders have pushed the cost of protecting against declines in the fund to the highest level since April 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors have grown pessimistic on financial stocks a day before JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. deliver their latest earnings reports. While analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect the group to boost profits by 4 per cent in the third quarter, it’s an uphill battle to lure investors to a sector tainted by recent upheavals at Deutsche Bank AG and Wells Fargo & Co. At the same time, uncertainty abounds amid bets that interest rates will rise only gradually, capping profit growth amid sluggish economic expansion. Financial shares plunged the most since June Thursday before paring losses, as a rally in Treasuries sent bond yields lower after Chinese trade data rekindled angst over the strength of the global economy. Banks lost 1.5 percent at 1:50 p.m. in New York, leading the S&P 500 lower by 0.4 per cent to 2,129.74. The gauge trimmed declines that reached 1.1 per cent as utilities and airlines rallied. “Maybe investors have finally caught on that analysts are too optimistic,” Brian Frank, portfolio manager at Key Biscayne, Fla.-based Frank Capital Partners LLC, said by phone. “Another risk is a systemic-type risk -- the ouster of Wells Fargo’s CEO, Deutsche Bank today coming out with a hiring freeze. I don’t think it’s over for the too-big-to-fail banks, and that’s causing some hedging.” Banks have been unloved for most of the year, with the S&P 500 financial index down almost 1 percent in 2016 compared with a 4 percent gain for the broader index. Deutsche Bank rattled the global sector last month after U.S. authorities sought a fine of up to $14 billion for crisis-era problems. Wells Fargo, which also reports results Friday, added to the mistrust when it was accused of creating fake accounts that led to Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf’s departure. Investors have taken note, pulling $6-billion from banking ETFs so far this year, more than from any other industry. The SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF, or XLF, has seen three straight quarters of withdrawals, the longest stretch since the bull market began, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Options protecting against a 10-per-cent drop in the XLF cost 9.5 points more than calls betting on a 10-per-cent rise on Sept. 30, according to six-month data compiled by Bloomberg. That marked the highest spread since April 2014. The spread was 6.8 points on Wednesday, still 11 per cent above the measure’s two-year average. Earnings season started with a thud this week, with the S&P 500 tumbling 1.2 per cent Tuesday after Alcoa Inc. missed estimates and companies from Illumina Inc. to Seagate Technology Plc reported or warned of disappointing results. JPMorgan is one of the few big banks expected to report earnings growth in the July-to-September period. Citigroup and Wells Fargo will see profits fall by 12 per cent and 4.2 per cent, respectively, according to analyst estimates. Banks weren’t alone in Thursday’s sell-off, as miners tumbled to the lowest since early July after data showed Chinese imports fell more than forecast. Power companies were the only group to advance as investors sought out safety. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 78 points, or 0.4 percent, to 18,066.20, paring an earlier slide by more than half. “China’s trade data below estimates is an overhang in the market, and from Europe, we’re hearing about a hard Brexit that’s making markets more jittery,” said Jeff Zipper, managing director of investments for The Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank. “We also had yesterday’s Fed minutes showing a strong chance we move in December, and the market is concerned about earnings season as well. It’s all of these things hitting at once.” Bets that the Fed will hike by December have increased, while a bitter U.S. presidential campaign that’s entering its final weeks is also keeping investors on edge. Traders are pricing in a 66-per-cent chance the Fed will raise rates in December, though Fed officials remain steadfast in their intention to tighten policy only gradually. A report today showed filings for unemployment benefits were at a four-decade low over the past two weeks. Upcoming economic data will give investors more indications about the potential rate path, including figures on retail sales, consumer sentiment and producer prices due on Friday. “It’s going to take some pretty lousy data to persuade the Fed to not raise rates,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist and director of research for Wunderlich Securities. “When you have the doves like Rosengren from Boston clearly turning hawkish, there’s been a pivot here. The Fed’s letting us know that December is something they have to be talked out of, not into.” The CBOE Volatility Index climbed for a third day on Thursday for the first time in six weeks. The measure of market turbulence known as the VIX rose 5.8 per cent to 16.83, poised for a one-month high, after posting its lowest quarterly average in two years.   Report Typo/Error   WFC-NWells Fargo & Co Latest Price$51.73 0.00 (0.00%) JPM-NJPMorgan Chase & Co Latest Price$76.69 0.00 (0.00%) C-NCitigroup Inc Latest Price$52.83 0.00 (0.00%) DB-NDeutsche Bank AG Latest Price$16.19 0.00 (0.00%) Updated November 11 4:00 PM EST. Delayed by at least 15 minutes.

"The macro picture still remains very mixed. I think the bigger issue for this particular quarter is that loan growth, which for Wells Fargo and most of the banks is really the critical driver of current and future earnings, has been pretty spotty," Wasserstrom told "Squawk on the Street." Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Citi report quarterly earnings before Friday's opening bell. On Wednesday, John Stumpf announced his retirement from Wells Fargo as chairman and CEO a month after the bank agreed to settle with regulators for $185 million for opening about 2 million accounts for bank customers who had never asked for them. Problems in big bank retailing do not necessarily mean chaos for the banking sector, said Miller. "Wells has a big balance sheet, they have a big mortgage company, they have other parts of that company besides the retail side that [do] very well," the FBR Capital Markets analyst said. "I think down the road it's going to be very difficult to rein a lot of this stuff in. That's why I think you've got to bring somebody from the outside to run that retail side." Wasserstrom said he is watching one of the quarter's worst performers, Citi, ahead of Friday's earnings reports. "I'm quite constructive on Citi," Wasserstrom said. "Part of the real benefit is, in fact, what's going on internationally, particularly among their consumer lending business in Mexico and a couple of other regions, which I think have the opportunity to provide top-line upside and positive operating leverage, which many other institutions will have difficulty generating," he said. When asked about an expected Federal Reserve interest rate hike in December, Miller said it will likely not be enough to have sweeping effects. "We need a lot of rate hikes, not just one or two," Miller contended. "You need four to eight rate hikes to really materially impact … net interest margins." "I don't think we're there yet, I don't think the economy's there yet. What I would like to see is a GDP growth rate north of 5 percent, that's going to cure all the ills, and I just don't see that here yet," Miller said.

Although only one of these financial institutions has been under investigation recently for systematic fraud, all have been feeling it as regulators are becoming more imposing. Solid earnings for this quarter have the potential to take the heat off the stock if only a little. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) has been making a very strong push since the Brexit this summer, with shares up over 25% in that time. Second-quarter results helped with these gains over the summer, even though the bank warned that profits for the quarter could drop by as much as 25% in June. However, results were much better than expected. Looking at the third quarter, Citigroup has not had any real hang-ups. Compared to this group of banks, it has performed the best in this time. The consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters are $1.16 in earnings per share (EPS) and $17.37 billion in revenue. When it reported its second-quarter results, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) set the standard for the other major banks. This megabank is known for its ironclad balance sheet, and at that time, it would seem, JPMorgan’s earnings lifted the market, giving a little more faith to the U.S. financial sector, as well as the rally that lasted through late September. Will JPMorgan have a repeat performance in the third quarter and pull the market up again? This has yet to be seen. But at a glance, its stock has performed well since the Brexit in terms of its peer group. As for what analysts are saying, the consensus estimates are $1.39 in EPS and revenue of $23.94 billion for this quarter. Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC) has been at the center of controversy in the financial sector after it was revealed that the company was creating unauthorized bank accounts and cross-selling these accounts without actually selling. Things got bad enough that former CEO John Stumpf was forced to step down from his position after facing a barrage of questions and accusations from congressional committees. Keep in mind that this is the only major bank that has been worse off since the Brexit, which is no easy feat. Even if earnings manage to impress, it’s very possible that the negative sentiment around this stock could cancel out any gains. But on the other hand, one has to ask if this stock has bottomed out. The consensus estimates call for EPS of $1.01 and $23.19 billion in revenue.

The Detroit Savings Bank Building project, which has five floors of office space and 56 apartments, was completed in February 2015. The Bloomfield Hills office of New York City-based Pillar Capital Finance LLC has originated $11.8 million in long-term debt for a $37 million Capitol Park redevelopment. The Detroit Savings Bank Building project at 1212 Griswold St. by Lansing-based Karp + Associates LLC has five floors of office space for the Archdiocese of Detroit and 56 apartments on the upper seven floors. Completed in February 2015, the new loan that closed Sept. 21 paid off a short-term J.P. Morgan Chase construction loan on the project, said David Wilkins, the managing director in the local Pillar office that originated the new Fannie Mae loan. Pillar has also done financing work for The Griswold, the 80-unit apartment development going in five floors above a parking deck at Michigan Avenue and Griswold Street downtown, among others.

U.S. Representatives vow to continue probes into cross selling Questions remain about whether Sloan can appease critics Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp John Stumpf’s decision to step down as chairman and chief executive officer of Wells Fargo & Co. won praise from analysts as way for the bank to put its cross-selling scandal behind it, even as lawmakers demanded more. “The decision is good news in the short term because it removes a dark cloud of uncertainty that was hanging over the bank,” Ian Katz, an analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, said in a note Wednesday after the company announced Stumpf’s retirement. Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, and Republican Richard Shelby, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, vowed to continue their investigations into the company. Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who called on Stumpf to step down last month, said he still needs to give back “every nickel he made while this scam was going on.” Wells Fargo shares, which had lost 9 percent since word of the scandal became public last month, dropped 1.4 percent to $44.67 at 3:23 p.m. in New York. That’s still a better performance than the 1.7 percent decline in the 24-company KBW Bank Index on Thursday. Tim Sloan, 56, the chief operating officer long viewed as Stumpf’s most likely successor, was named CEO Wednesday, and the San Francisco-based company named a new non-executive chairman and vice chair. Wells Fargo had already refunded $2.6 million to affected customers and said it’s ending sales incentives that have been blamed for the abuses. Stumpf previously agreed to forgo $41 million in unvested stock that had been granted for performance, as well as some of his salary. The bank is at risk of losing market share to local or regional firms such as U.S. Bancorp, Charles Peabody, an analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television Thursday. The full extent of damage probably won’t be know until “well into 2017,” Peabody said. The stock fell as much as 12 percent after settlements tied to the scandal were announced, and its subsequent rebound hasn’t been enough for Wells Fargo to retake the top spot in market value among U.S. banks, which it relinquished to JPMorgan Chase & Co. ‘Still Solid’ But the announcement Wednesday “signals the board’s acknowledgment of the severity of the sales practice issue and its commitment to addressing the required changes,” analysts led by John Pancari at Evercore ISI wrote in a note to clients late Wednesday. They also will preserve the bank’s “still-solid culture and formidable banking presence throughout other areas of the company,” according to Evercore. Stumpf’s nine-year tenure as CEO saw Wells Fargo grow to become the biggest U.S. home lender with returns that were the envy of other bank executives. The profits were driven in part by cross-selling -- offering credit cards to customers who opened checking accounts, for example -- the strategy that’s at the center of the scandal that brought Stumpf down. His unraveling began Sept. 8, when the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that Wells Fargo had agreed to pay $185 million to settle allegations it secretly opened the unauthorized accounts. Multimillion-dollar settlements have become almost routine in the banking industry, but the brazenness and breadth of the misconduct struck a nerve. The U.S. Senate called a hearing, and two weeks later Stumpf traveled to Washington for a three-hour grilling, where lawmakers took turns berating him. Warren accused him of “gutless leadership” for blaming junior employees. “You should resign,” she told Stumpf. “You should be criminally investigated by both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.” At a second hearing on Sept. 29, called by the House Financial Services Committee, Stumpf denied there was any organized effort to open sham accounts. Lawmakers suggested the bank should be broken up and called for his arrest. Questioning Sloan Sloan’s ascent may not appease the bank’s critics. He’s close to Stumpf, serving on the operating committee and holding several of the company’s most senior posts. And Sloan was chief financial officer for three years until 2014, when he took over the bank’s Wall Street operations. He became president and chief operating officer last November, overseeing key divisions that include the retail arm, where abuses occurred. “We should still expect heightened regulatory scrutiny of incentive structures and persistent legislative calls for breaking up the nation’s biggest banks,” Isaac Boltansky, an analyst at Compass Point, said in a note Thursday. “Mr. Sloan’s long and prominent career at Wells Fargo is likely to leave many lawmakers with the sense that the bank has not sufficiently distanced itself from the cultural collapses that facilitated the account scandal.” U.S. Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, said in a statement that she’s concerned about Sloan’s role in the scandal, because he had “a central role in the chain of command that ought to have stopped this misconduct.” Yet Sloan is highly regarded internally and, importantly, didn’t work within the tainted branch network during the misconduct, said Marty Mosby, an analyst at Vining Sparks. “His background has been the wholesale bank and not the consumer bank,” Mosby said. So the appointment “is kind of a fresh slate.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Payment cards still inflict pain of a different sort. American merchants paid more than $40 billion to process debit- and credit-card transactions in 2015. Despite a reform by the Federal Reserve in 2011 aimed at reducing these costs, revenue from these so-called “interchange fees” has more than doubled since the financial crisis. Retailers are still in revolt; banks are still resisting. That is not surprising, since they rely on the fees for a large and growing share of their income. American consumers favour debit and credit cards over cash by more than two to one. But this convenience comes at a cost. The seller is charged a fee for every card purchase: in America, typically 0.5% to 3% of its value. These fees are set by payment-card networks, such as Visa and MasterCard and collected by card issuers, such as Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase. Some portion of these fees is borne by consumers, including those who pay by cash, in the form of higher prices.   Retailers have long argued that card networks use their market power to set excessively high fees. Card providers maintain that such fees are necessary to cover the cost of processing payments and combating fraud. Policymakers have struggled to settle the debate. Payment-card markets are hard to regulate. Cap fees too harshly and banks may not bother issuing cards; allow them to climb too high and merchants will stop accepting them. Either way, the consumer would be the loser. In 2011 the Federal Reserve capped fees on most debit-card transactions at 21 cents plus 0.05% of the value of the transaction. Payment networks responded by ending discounts on low-price transactions, so fees went up for many small outlets, such as convenience stores. Meanwhile, banks raised customer fees and cut rewards. In 2014 economists at the Federal Reserve estimated that banks recouped nearly half of the lost income with higher service charges and lower card rewards. Interchange fees have continued to grow—by over 8.5% a year between 2012 and 2015. Many banks have become increasingly reliant on these fees, which now account for 43% of card fees, according to R.K. Hammer, a bank-card advisory firm (see chart). Chase, America’s largest credit-card issuer, earns nearly 16% of its total revenue from interchange fees. Merchants have developed strategies for avoiding card fees. Some no longer accept more expensive cards, or impose credit-card minimums. Others steer their customers to cheaper payment methods. In 2015, Kroger, a Cincinnati-based grocer, installed point-of-sale terminals that routed debit-card payments over PIN debit networks, rather than more expensive, less secure signature networks. After Visa fined it $7m for the offence, Kroger filed suit. Walmart and Home Depot have each sued Visa over similar disputes. To offset rising costs, some merchants—from taxi-drivers to utilities—now charge customers for paying with cards. This practice, known as “surcharging”, is no longer banned by payment-card rules, but is still illegal in ten states. The Supreme Court will soon weigh in, hearing a case brought by a group of New York retailers who say the state’s ban on credit-card surcharges is unconstitutional. Whoever wins the legal battle, the plastic wars will rumble on. twitter icon facebook icon more iconMore linkedin icon googleplus icon mail icon print icon purchase-rights icon View comments (1) Editors’ picks America’s new presidentThe Trump era His victory threatens old certainties about America and its role in the world.

[Illustration: MaryliaDesign/iStock] Ben Schiller 10.10.16 10:50 AM At the Greater Lowell Technical High School in Massachusetts, students are learning what it takes to run a CVS store. The school has a full mockup CVS complete with a stocked pharmacy and shelves full of deodorant, toothbrushes, and notebooks. In the very definition of "hands on," students fill prescriptions, manage merchandise and pricing, and market the brand (though the pills they count don't contain active ingredients). To Willa Seldon, a partner with the Bridgespan Group, the initiative is a good example of how companies and schools can work together to develop the talent businesses want. CVS Health has a deep need for entry level staff: it hires 1,000 workers a week to keep its 9,600 locations up and running. And recently it's been looking for "innovative ways to leverage un-tapped talent pools," in the words of David Casey, its vice president of workforce strategies. Three-quarters of the students at Greater Lowell are from low-income backgrounds, and, in the past, they might have been overlooked in favor of applicants who have completed high school and already developed workplace skills. Bridgespan, a consultancy based in Boston, says companies are increasingly meeting their needs by hiring "opportunity youth"—the estimated 6.7 million people aged 16-24 who are neither in school or working. Seldon and her colleagues give some examples in a recent piece in the Stanford Social Innovation Review. State Street, Starbucks, Walmart, JPMorgan Chase, and Gap are all training teens and young adults from low-income communities (sometimes, as in CVS, before youths have left school). Forty-five companies have now joined the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative—a coalition committed to accessing "new sources of talent from communities that have not traditionally been included in our nation’s prosperity." "There's an opportunity to address both the issues companies are facing but also address the issues of youth," Seldon says. "As we think about our future, these youth will ultimately be in positions that will sustain our economy. Not investing in them is a huge long-term issue." Research shows that when young people aren't employed for more than a year, it seriously hurts their future. If you compare males with the same background and one gets a job and the other doesn't, there's a 23% difference in earnings 10 years later. And at the moment, many youths don't have jobs. At 12%, the unemployment rate for 16-to-24 year-olds is roughly double the full out-of-work rate. Seldon says companies are recognizing they can meet their needs while doing good for their communities. "Many companies make some effort to introduce young people to what they do. What's new is that some are now saying 'we actually have a problem finding entry level workers who will stay with our organization' and they are taking a different approach," she argues. That includes collaborating with nonprofits like Year Up, which identifies at-need urban youth, works with companies to understand the skills they need, and then trains young people in IT, finance and sales skills, as well as soft skills like how to dress for an interview and how to deal with criticism during a personnel review. Seldon says investing in such programs produces a win-win in the shape of higher retention rates and reduced costs from having to repeatedly hire new people. For example, Year Up interns that work at State Street, the financial services firm, stay an average of 45 months compared to just 16 months for 20-to 24-year-olds on average across the country. Hiring someone with less schooling and training does come with challenges, and companies need different HR strategies than they've used in the past, Seldon argues. That includes screening candidates for native aptitude rather than their formal educational accomplishments. It means more one-on-one mentoring once young people are on the job. And it means more empathy and flexibility around home-life challenges, from childcare to court dates. But Bridgespan thinks these extra responsibilities are worth it. It estimates companies will have 6 million entry-level positions to fill by 2022. Not to the mention the wider social impact of employing young people. "It’s a business imperative with very real social benefits," says David Casey, at CVS. "By offering opportunities for youth development, companies like ours are able to provide youth with a source of dignity, pride and identity through meaningful work and a more defined career track."

(NYSE: TWLO) has made a huge run since its initial public offering (IPO) debut this summer and now shareholders are looking to cash in. Twilio is following in the footsteps of another unicorn, Acacia Communications Inc. (NASDAQ: ACIA). Both companies are having secondary offerings to cash in on their massive runs over the summer. A secondary offering after a stock has jumped massively is one way for companies (or selling shareholders) to literally cash in on their success. In some cases the company is diluting shareholders, but it is funding further growth within the company. In other cases selling shareholders are just looking to cash in on the run. Twilio filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a proposed follow-on offering. No pricing details were given in the filing, but the offering is valued up to $400 million. The company has a total market cap of $5 billion. The underwriters for the offering are Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Allen, Pacific Crest, JMP Securities and Canaccord Genuity. Bank in June, Twilio entered the market with a bang. The company ended up pricing its IPO at $15, above of the expected price range of $12 to $14. However, it actually entered the market close to $25. There were 10 million shares in the offering, with an overallotment option for an additional 1.5 million. Just last Friday, Acacia announced the pricing of its follow-on public offering of 4.5 million shares at $100 per share, with an overallotment option for an additional 675,000 shares. At this price the entire offering is valued up to $517.5 million. The offering consists of 1,210,302 shares from the company and 3,289,698 shares from certain existing stockholders. Keep in mind Acacia Communications currently has a total market cap near $3.7 billion. The underwriters for the offering are Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, Needham, Cowen, William Blair and Northland Capital Markets. Looking back at its IPO in May, the company priced its 4.5 million shares at the high end of its range of $21 to $23 per share. At this price, the entire offering would have been valued up to roughly $119 million. However, the stock actually entered the market at $29, well above the set price. Since that time, the stock has risen to over $125 per share. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Shares of Twilio were trading down over 7% at $56.14 on Monday, with a consensus analyst price target of $39.00 and a 52-week trading range of $23.66 to $70.96. Acacia shares were down more than 3% to $96.66. The consensus price target is $114.00, and the 52-week range is $27.05 to $128.73.

(AAPL) Stock Offers a Sneaky, Safer Way to Go Long View All Posts Looming earnings reports from key financials and little in the way of clarity from the Fed result in a stalemate on Wednesday. For its part, the S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) finished down a narrow .05% in tight, inside trade worthy of keeping autumnal volatility seekers of all kinds at arm’s length. Indecision, indecision, indecision. That sums up Wednesday’s indecisive markets and the Fed’s Minutes from its September meeting. Fed fund futures are currently and still pricing in a 60% chance interest rates will be nudged higher by 25 basis points for just the second time since last December’s raise. Bottom-line, Yellen & Co. are unsurprisingly divided between being data dependent, handmaids to Wall Street and those members recognizing “lower for longer” has already run its course. Following Tuesday’s relatively dramatic selloff within the S&P 500’s (still) tight trading range, indecision to act out further or for that matter, “buy, buy, buy!” may be a function of investors waiting on the boys in pinstripes. Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C), JPMorgan & Chase Co. (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) are set to announce their quarterly results Friday morning and possibly set the tone for earnings season. 7 Stocks That Will Hit the Skids by Christmas Within Wednesday’s quiet on the western front, the energy complex slid for a second straight session. NYMEX crude dipped 0.80% to finish below $50 a barrel at $49.78. Backing the follow-through profit-taking, traders appear to be still giving weight to Tuesday’s bearish OPEC production report for September which saw output at its highest level since 2008. Biotech was also under technical duress for a second session. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index ETF (NYSEARCA:IBB) sank nearly 2.50% and in the process, hitting a three month low while giving up 200-day simple moving average support. With no specific sector news traders could simply be pricing in the price of a Clinton presidency and its impact on abusive healthcare price practices. Coupled with Tuesday’s 3.8% tailspin, the two day selloff in IBB is the deepest for the sector since June’s Brexit event. Shares of biotech giant Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:REGN), which slumped by 3.26% on no apparent news and Illumina, Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN) which warned on Tuesday, were two pieces of eye candy for bears. Unusual Movers: Options With bulls and bears wrestling with future price direction and hoping for beneficial autumnal volatility, the CBOE Volatility Index found a modest bid of 3.45% to 15.89%. The quick rush to buy portfolio insurance this week has driven the notorious “fear gauge” roughly 19% above its 10-day simple moving average. Typically, spreads in excess of 15% represent short-term opportunities to fade aggressive and generally, temporary behavior. At the same time and repeating yesterday’s observation, with most historical panics coinciding with readings in excess of 25% to 30% in the VIX and recognizing we’re only in the first half of October; we’re probably not there yet. Facebook It appears someone really likes Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB). The social media darling saw 9,300 of the Weekly Nov. 4 $137 calls trade on Wednesday and was among one of the most active contracts for S&P 500 constituents. Compared to open interest of 3,600, Wednesday’s trading activity in the short-term and out-of-the-money call contract points to an opening and very bullish buyer. The contract is currently stationed above FB stock by 6% but with a closing price of 1.23 would require about 7% to breakeven at expiration. You Don’t Have to Like Trump to Love Smith & Wesson With just 7 trading days of life for the call, the assumed purchase appears to be a wager on Facebook delivering an earnings report worthy of other investors “liking” FB shares when it reports after the closing bell on Nov. 2.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Thursday, 13 October 2016 | MYT 3:51 PM Snapchat picks Morgan Stanley, Goldman to lead IPO: sources Early reports: Snapchat, whose parent is Snap Inc, and the banks were not immediately available to comment on the news first reported by Bloomberg News. — Reuters US messaging app Snapchat has chosen Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc as lead underwriters for an initial public offering that could come as early as March, a source familiar with the situation said on Oct 12.  The banks were notified earlier this week that they had been awarded one of most coveted and potentially lucrative IPO mandates in recent years, as the Venice, California-based company vies for a US$25bil (RM105.50bil) valuation in the stock market.  JPMorgan Chase & Co, Deutsche Bank AG, Allen & Co, Barclays Plc and Credit Suisse Group AG will be joint book runners, the source said, asking not to be named because the information was not yet public.  Snapchat, whose parent is Snap Inc, and the banks were not immediately available to comment on the news first reported by Bloomberg News.  Snapchat started in 2012 as a free mobile app that allows users to send photos and messages that vanish within seconds. It has more than 100 million active users, about 60% of whom are aged 13 to 24, making it an attractive way for advertisers to reach millennials.  Awash in venture funding, the company raised US$1.81bil (RM7.63bil) in May, which valued it at about US$20bil (RM84.38bil), media reports said at the time.  But investors worry that Snapchat's advertising sales, which began last October, is the company's only significant revenue source.  Snap in September starting describing itself as a camera company. Its first physical product will be glasses with an embedded video camera. Users will be able to record video from their perspective in 10-second increments, which can be synched with their smartphones.  The company's last round of funding included General Atlantic, Sequoia Capital, T. Rowe Price and Lone Pine. Previous rounds included Fidelity Investment, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Yahoo! Inc.  The US IPO market has been unfriendly to technology companies for most of 2016. Year to date, technology IPOs have raised roughly US$2.3bil (RM9.70bil), compared to US$5.2bil (RM21.94bil) over the same period in 2015. But a recent string of such IPOs has instilled more confidence among investors. — Reuters You May Be Interested Overwatch will be free to play for a weekend Progress, but uphill slog for women in tech EU questions US over Yahoo e-mail scanning, amid privacy concerns Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

Plan That Could Make Its Founders Billions Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Snap To It Snapchat Moves Forward with I.P.O. Plan That Could Make Its Founders Billions The $18 billion messaging company has chosen Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to lead its initial public offering. by Maya KosoffOctober 13, 2016 8:25 am Email Facebook Twitter Digital Colorization by Ben Park; From NurPhoto/Getty Images. Evan Spiegel has been clear about his intentions to take Snapchat public for the past year. In 2015, before the company announced it would be moving beyond ephemeral messaging and into hardware, he sat onstage at Recode’s annual Code conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, and teased the idea of a public offering. “We need to I.P.O., we have a plan to do that,” he said. Now, Snapchat’s newly named parent company, Snap, seems to be putting a plan to go public into action. Snap has picked Morgan Stanley, which led an earlier round of debt financing, and Goldman Sachs to lead its I.P.O., Bloomberg reports. Not wanting to be left out of a potentially huge tech I.P.O., Credit Suisse, Barclays, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, and Allen & Co. will also all be joint bookrunners in a public offering that is expected to value the company at $25 billion or more. That valuation is based on Snapchat’s own revenue forecasts and user growth. A pitch deck from Snapchat’s Series F round of funding revealed that last year, Snapchat brought in $59 million in revenue—a low number that reflected the fact that Snapchat had only just began to monetize its business. This year, Snapchat says it will generate revenues between $250 million and $350 million. And next year, the company estimates it will reach revenues between $500 million and $1 billion. Analysts at eMarketer also say that Snapchat could reach nearly $1 billion in ad revenue in 2017. Those numbers are bolstered by a number of new efforts to generate revenue. Though it first offered expensive advertisements a year ago, asking brands for a minimum of $750,000 for a one-day ad, Snapchat has since built out its advertising offerings. Now, for example, advertisers can pay in the neighborhood of $250,000 for a “Live Story” ad or $50,000 to take over a publisher’s channel on Snapchat Discover. Advertisers can also create “Lenses,” customized, popular face-distorting photo filters, and pay for them to appear in front of Snapchat users. A Snapchat I.P.O. would be good news for Silicon Valley, which has seen a slowdown in public offerings since 2014, when Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba went public at a $168 billion valuation. A Snap I.P.O., which could happen as soon as the first three months of 2017, would also be vindication for Spiegel and co-founder Bobby Murphy, who famously turned down an acquisition offer from Facebook for $3 billion in 2013. In the event of a $25 billion I.P.O., both co-founders would own a $4 billion stake in the company, CNBC reports.

Jason Estremera, 33, Lakewood Co-owner of Trunk, a men's boutique in the Gordon Square Arts District, director of the non-profit Hispanic Business Center, on the boards of Cleveland Public Theatre and Young Latino Network and involved in the Hispanic theater group Teatro Publico de Cleveland. You've brought someone today, who? James Ventura is my best friend and business partner in Trunk. We have different styles and bring that to the store. Tell us about the Hispanic Business Center. Hispanic Business Center is a small business development center (SBDC). We work with anyone and we can do most of our services in Spanish. We work with folks who are starting or growing their businesses. That's my 9 to 5 job. Have you always been interested in theater? Yes, I have. My personality is very theatrical! I was in "Johanna: Facing Forward." It was the story of Johanna Orozco, the Cleveland teen who survived a gunshot to her face by her ex-boyfriend. It was a big production; I played Juan Ruiz, the ex-boyfriend. Fashion Flash: Jason Estremera visits How did you find yourself here, doing what you do? I was born in Cleveland, we moved to Chicago when I was 2 years old. I got my bachelor's in textiles, apparel and merchandising from Northern Illinois University. My original journey was to work in fashion. I had a corporate position with Kohl's and then went into banking with JP Morgan Chase. I moved back to Cleveland seven years ago while still in banking. It wasn't my journey, but it landed me back in Cleveland. I stayed with banking for a few years and got my MBA from Cleveland State University. Then I was recruited by the Hispanic Business Center. Trunk is a beautiful store, tell us about it. I love Chicago and I think that aided in the way the store feels and what it is. There are stores there that have a certain thing about them and I wanted to bring that feeling here. About a year ago, I decided to create a store with the products and the edginess we lacked. It's on Detroit in the Detroit Shoreway neighborhood. I won $1,000 in a business plan competition with the Detroit Shoreway Development office. I did everything by hand at night after theater rehearsals. I was building the store sometimes until 2 a.m. I made all of the fixtures, I did a lot of garbage picking for cool pieces. I put an old fence on the wall for decoration. What is the mission of Trunk? James and I met, we both liked fashion. We liked being a little wild with our looks and bringing some frivolity to going out in Cleveland. There were some stores opening that catered to men, but they just didn't fit my personal style. There's a store in Chicago called the Belmont Army Surplus. It's three floors with used military clothing, new designer pieces, shoes and second-hand. It had everything for men and women. It was my playground. I wanted to bring that kind of feel to Cleveland, where you can feel connected to your personal style. The people who shop there vary. It's a comfortable place for everyone. There isn't one image or style. Trunk is a great place to play and experiment. We have clothing and accessories, tie pins and bars, belts and bolo ties. We also have wonderful skin care and life style products including a line from John Masters Organics. How do you build a wardrobe? I sometimes go to Saks or Nordstrom to buy one crucial piece and then build onto it with things I can buy for a quarter or a dollar elsewhere. How do you curate for the store? Trunk started with just second-hand clothing from estate sales. I go to those on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Now we carry new and used men's clothing. I look for the right fit and condition. For instance, I don't want to carry dress shirts with the awful cuts from the '80s or '90s. I don't want that feeling that you have to sift through bad stuff to find one good thing. I only want to carry the best things. I find the best pieces in the fabrics of the current season. We also carry new things from brands like Quicksilver, Puma and Happy Socks and we carry items from local makers like Wright & Rede, Forest City Portage and Brutal Beard. The biggest thing is that everything needs to be affordable. We serve the community needs. Our neighborhood is largely low-income and some higher-income people moving into the Battery Park area. I'm interested in people having good, affordable clothes so we offer resale and new for that reason. What drives you to work so hard and own your own business? Two important things happened. One of my very first sales was based out of love. I helped two women who were getting married find a pair of perfect wool pants to match a jacket that one of them owned and wanted to wear for the ceremony. We had the pants. And, last holiday season as I assumed people wouldn't gift used clothing, families from the neighborhood came in and bought clothes for gifts, I thought it was amazing that we could offer affordable, nice things and they would still have money to create a wonderful holiday table. It meant so much to me. When it comes to business, you have to love what you're doing or get out. I also like that we get to know our customers. Is the store run by just the two of you? We've partnered with YOU, Youth Opportunities Unlimited and Ohio Guidestone, a foster care program. We provide foster care kids with work experience. They get paid to be at the store. We've put four people through the program. When they're at the store they also put together resumes and do mock interviews. Now they've been hired out to other jobs. We identify where their interests are and teach them all the functions of running a store. Do you also offer styling? Yes, we like to help with personal styling. If anyone needs help, they can stop in or call. James just helped a man who was visiting from Scotland. Unexpectedly, he had a date and needed something casual but nice. He bought a great outfit for about $50. We also had a man who was color blind and had been embarrassed to ask for help. We have some nice stories of helping men and women. We have androgynous pieces and menswear is in for women, as well. Other than at Trunk, where else do you shop? I go to Urban Outfitters. I love the G-Star brand carried at Brigade at Beachwood Place. I love West Side Skates in Lakewood for Vans. I collect shoes. How do you describe your style? I am Street meets office wear. I'm modern, put-together and often unexpected. Who are your fashion icons? Growing up, I really looked up to David Bowie, Trent Reznor, Robert Smith, Johnny Rotten, all musicians who challenged the norms of how men can express themselves through fashion. Music inspires so much of my every day and when I look for inspiration, I turn to music but I also feel inspired by everyday people. There's an amazing energy to Midwest style that I find dynamic, honest and tough. What do you think about trends? Karl Lagerfeld famously said, "Trendy is the last stage before tacky." I think that anything in excess is dangerous, and that applies to trends. Which designers do you like? Vivienne Westwood, Tom Ford, DSquared, Marc Jacobs, Jeremy Scott, Rick Owens What are your pet peeves about local fashion? Tom Ford once said, "Dressing well is a form of good manners." When it comes to one's appearance, wherever you live, we should respect ourselves and others by showing up put together. Where do you get your sense of style? Initially from my mother who was always wearing something different and she raised me on a diet of rock music. My pops always told me to be true to myself and these two experiences really shaped how I approach style. My father lived in a suit and tie and my mother was definitely the opposite. When I look in the mirror, I can definitely see their influences in the way I dress. What's your best fashion advice? Always be yourself. What else is happening at Trunk? We are opening for designer Valerie Mayen's Hullabaloo fashion show on Nov. 5, it's a fundraiser for the Cleveland Food Bank. We'll have a pop-up shop and we have 10 looks walking the runway. We're having an art show on Nov. 30 with some great local Hispanic artists and photographers. Trunk is located at 6515 Detroit Avenue. Check TrunkCleveland.com for information.

JPMorgan Saying that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) was among the leaders in the mortgage arena, as well as in credit cards, retail branch banking, asset management and investment banking, analyst Biggar noted that the company has been recording healthy capital levels. JPMorgan has undertaken significant share buybacks, while also announcing dividend hikes. The company has benefited from efficiency improvements. Biggar commented that JPMorgan was “pretty well diversified” and that its share price “should continue to do well." BofA Among the large banks, Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC) has the capability of generating the biggest upside surprises in earnings. The analyst added, “After limping thru some stress tests in recent years, it's in a much stronger position now in terms of capital levels.” Bank of America had been rapidly announcing dividend hikes and undertaking share buyback activity. BB&T BB&T Corporation (NYSE: BBT) was more of a “pure-play regional,” Biggar mentioned. While the company is based in North Carolina, it had a significant presence in Florida, Virginia and Washington DC, regions that are “growing above the national average in terms of deposit growth and loan growth."

Business Market report: EnQuest in £82m cash call as North Sea oil sale flops Jamie Nimmo Thursday 13 October 2016 11:19 BST Under pressure: EnQuest is struggling to cope with huge debts amid low oil prices EnQuest Struggling North Sea oil firm EnQuest today asked shareholders for an £82 million lifeline in its bid to stay afloat under the weight of huge debts. Shares in the company, one of the largest producers in the UK’s North Sea, fell 0.92p, or 3.3%, to 26.83p as it confirmed plans to tap shareholders in a placing and open offer at 23p per share. Chief executive Amjad Bseisu pledged to back the offer to the tune of £28 million. The discounted share sale, run as an accelerated bookbuild by JPMorgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch, was unveiled alongside changes to its revolving credit facility which EnQuest said it had agreed with “key stakeholders”. They include Aberdeen Asset Management and Schroders. It comes after the company failed to sell part of its stake in the Kraken oil field, which is expected to start producing next year. The FTSE 100 slipped back below 7000, off 39.52 points to 6984.49, and the pound was back below $1.22. Miners were the main culprits for the Footsie’s slide after weak trade data from China, reigniting concerns about its appetite for industrial metals. Anglo-Aussie iron ore giants BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto bore the brunt of the sell-off. BHP dropped 55.01p, or 4.4%, to 1183.49p and Rio lost 115.5p, or 4.3%, to 2592p. Standard Life, down 16.7p at 332.2p, followed miners lower after Barclays cut its rating on the investment giant to underweight. Analyst Alan Devlin said the performance of Global Absolute Return Strategies, its flagship fund, has been poor over the past 18 months. “We have seen a similar experience at flagship funds at both Hendersons and M&G (owned by the Pru), where earnings estimates have declined 10% and 20% respectively,” Devlin added. Marks & Spencer was 2p cheaper at 326.1p after Liberum threw the retailer onto its conviction Sell list.  The broker warned that online clothing sales would not make up for falling store sales of clothing over the next few years. Silver miner Hochschild Mining shone on the mid-cap index, up 7.4p to 259.4p, after record third-quarter production prompted it to raise full-year output forecasts for the second time.  Booker Group, owner of Budgens and Londis stores, improved 2.5p to 178.1p, inspired by solid interim results that revealed sales grew 13% to £2.5 billion, with pre-tax profits up 9% to £81 million.  Online trading firm Plus500 added 10.5p at 643p after JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley increased their stakes to above 5%.
