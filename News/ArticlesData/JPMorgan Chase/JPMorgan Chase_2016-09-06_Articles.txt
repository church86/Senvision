 JPMorgan just made two big promotions in a key trading business Matt Turner Sep. 7, 2016, 11:15 AM 6,040 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. Thomson Reuters JPMorgan has announced two new coheads of its equities business, following the departure of Tim Throsby to Barclays. The bank announced today that Mark Leung and Jason Sippel would become global coheads of equities, effective immediately. They will also manage the prime services business, which caters to hedge funds, with James Kenny. They will also join the corporate and investment bank management team. Both Leung and Sippel are longtime JPMorgan employees. Leung joined JPMorgan in 1997 and went through the bank's markets training program. He was most recently head of the equities business in Asia Pacific. Sippel has been with the bank for 14 years and was most recently global head of prime services, having previously headed Americas equities. JPMorgan has made its equities business a key focus in recent years. The bank finished 2015 ranked third for equities revenues, according to data from the analytics firm Coalition. That compares with a No. 1 ranking in fixed income, currencies and commodities, and investment banking. Cash equities, or stock trading, was the one business line in which the bank did not have a top-three ranking in 2015. "We are positioned incredibly well and yet, we still see more opportunities for us to invest and grow," Daniel Pinto, CEO of the corporate and investment bank, said in a memo announcing the changes.

That’s according to Adrian Mowat, the chief Asian and emerging-market equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., who predicts the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index will climb a further 11 percent by the end of the year. The benchmark gauge of mainland companies traded in the city jumped 8.8 percent in the month through Tuesday to beat all global indexes tracked by Bloomberg. Mowat said investors are still too downbeat on the nation’s equities given better-than-estimated profits by companies most exposed to swings in economic growth. Some 65 percent of stocks on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index beat expectations in the first half of the year, the best performance since 2012. Even after the rebound, the gauge trades at an earnings multiple 60 percent lower than the global average. “There’s too much pessimism around China," said Mowat, the Hong Kong-based strategist who turned bullish on the nation’s equities in April. “If you look at the profit numbers we’re beginning to see the cyclical sectors beat." The gauge of so-called H shares has rebounded 32 percent since reaching a seven-year low in February, when concern over China’s economic slowdown and heavy-handed state intervention in mainland financial markets had investors fleeing for the exits. The index, which is still 33 percent below last year’s peak in May, climbed 0.3 percent to a nine-month high on Wednesday. Insurers were among companies topping forecasts with first-half earnings. Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. reported an 18 percent increase in net income as growth in premiums and banking revenue helped offset the impact of stock-market declines. The earnings outlook for state-owned enterprises is still clouded. More than twice as many companies on the H-share index reported negative first-half growth than last year and the economic picture is subdued. Data on exports, industrial production and retail sales all fell short of economists’ estimates in July. "We’re not saying that China doesn’t have any structural problems, but perhaps after the big fall we saw in the A share market last year and all the concerns on the yuan, investors’ level of anxiety is still a little bit too high," Mowat said. The H-share index has climbed about 12 percent since he raised his rating on Chinese stocks to overweight. Relative Strength Technical indicators suggest the Hang Seng China Enterprise’s rebound is at risk of overheating. The gauge’s 14-day relative strength index has climbed above the 70 level that signals to some traders gains are overdone. Ping An’s RSI has risen to 72.7, while that of Bank of Communication Co. is the highest in a decade. Mowat’s forecasts haven’t always panned out in the past. He said last June that a slump in mainland shares would be a buying opportunity because of expected government support. The Shanghai Composite Index fell more than 30 percent in the next two months. Still, he’s not alone in seeing an extended rally in H shares. Deutsche Bank AG is also bullish, predicting in a note last week that profit growth by non-financial companies will accelerate in the second half, prompting analysts to raise their estimates. “If you get profits, you’ve got a little bit less of a risk premium and China does well," Mowat said. “So I’m upbeat about that."

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Sep 6, 2016 at 4:00PM When it comes to dividends and stock buybacks, these two banks make it rain. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. One reason investors have long had a penchant for bank stocks is because they tend to pay generous dividends. But quarterly distributions are only half the story when it comes to rewarding shareholders. To get a true sense of how much capital a bank returns to its shareholders, you also have to factor in stock buybacks. If you combine the amount of money that the nation's biggest banks pay out to shareholders through both of these methods, two bank stocks separate themselves from the pack: Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Over the past 12 months, these banks distributed nearly twice as much capital as third- and fourth-place finishers Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. There are three reasons that Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase are in a league of their own when it comes to returning capital, the first of which relates to their size. JPMorgan Chase is the biggest bank in the country. At the end of the second quarter, the New York City-based bank had $2.5 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet. And if you include assets that it administers but are owned by clients -- namely, assets under management or custody -- then its size balloons to nearly $25 trillion. Wells Fargo, by contrast, ranks third, with $1.9 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet. This is smaller than Bank of America, which has $2.2 trillion in assets, but Wells Fargo is gaining quickly on its larger rival. It eclipsed Citigroup last year to lay claim to the No. 3 spot, and at Wells Fargo's current rate of growth, it could do the same to Bank of America in the near future. The second reason that Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase distribute so much capital to shareholders is because they earn a lot of money. Wells Fargo reported $22.4 billion in net income over the past 12 months, according to data from YCharts.com, while JPMorgan Chase earned an even more impressive $23.9 billion. They have little choice but to pay out a lot of capital, in other words, to ensure that it doesn't build up on their balance sheets and thereby weigh down their return on equity, which is the primary profitability metric tracked by bank stock investors. This helps to explain why Bank of America and Citigroup trade for such low valuations, as their less-generous dividend and buyback programs have swelled their respective shareholders' equities. The final reason that Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase pay out so much more than their counterparts is because they can. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed in the wake of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve gained veto power over bank capital plans. Now, if a bank wants to boost its dividend or its repurchase authorization, it must request the Fed's permission in the comprehensive capital analysis and review (CCAR), the second stage of the annual stress tests. This is inconvenient, but it hasn't stopped Wells Fargo or JPMorgan Chase from raising their dividends every year since 2011. Bank of America and Citigroup, by contrast, haven't been as fortunate. Both have had their capital proposals rejected by the central bank multiple times since the stress tests were inaugurated six years ago. The net result is that they've been allowed to boost their dividends only twice each since the crisis, most recently this year. In sum, if you're looking for bank stocks that return the most capital to shareholders, then the obvious place to start is by going with the biggest and best banks in the country: Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase.

"QE reduces lending rates to negative and we are going to expect negative lending rates until 2021," Kian Abouhossein, head of European banks equity research at JPMorgan told CNBC Tuesday. "So as long as that is the case, margins will not improve. Sixty percent of revenues is net interest income and as long as that's the case earnings will not improve. So return on equity is very low." European banks are more akin to their Japanese counterparts and less like Wall Street, warns JPMorgan, who has detailed how a negative interest rate policy has led to ongoing pressure on revenues and profit margins. Europe has seen a balance sheet recession since the economic crisis of 2008, it said, highlighting that a 10.9 percent increase in reserves at these banks has failed to increase lending to the wider economy. "QE has worked initially and helped to stabilize asset prices, and to lower funding cost for banks …. However, the secondary long-term effects of QE are manifesting themselves in the form of pressure on revenues for European Banks with customer margins in euro area declining from 2.5 percent in 2011 to 1.8 percent in 2015," the report said. The European Central Bank (ECB), the Danish National Bank (DNB), the Swedish Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) have all pushed key short-term policy rates into negative territory. A negative interest rate policy, or NIRP, essentially charges banks to hold cash at a central bank in the hope that they will instead lend to the real economy. Many expect banks to pass on this disincentive to save to its customers by trimming rates or by ramping up borrowing costs. The policy is increasingly being seen as a viable option for central bankers after Japan's move below zero earlier this year. While this stimulates growth in some cases, negative rates put pressure on other sectors of the economy. A number of leading analysts have called for a balance of monetary and fiscal measures in order to slowly get the economy out of "QE infinity" – a paradox whereby low rates and seemingly endless rounds of bond-buying programs encourage cheap borrowing. Alberto Gallo, head of macro strategies and manager of the Algebris Macro Credit Fund, told CNBC last week that for the global economy to exit this QE infinity trap, government action and reforms to improve productivity are needed. "Many governments are reluctant to accept the need for these measures, often instead implementing policies that win votes but compound the distortions of easy monetary policy e.g. housing affordability programmes, mortgage subsidies," he said. Without an adequate fiscal response from governments, growing imbalances make it harder to withdraw stimulus, warned Gallo. However, profit margins are not the only problems that banks in Europe are facing currently. "There are two factors," Abouhossein told CNBC. "Operationally it is cost cutting and second is finding a price for non-performing loans. Non-performing loans need to come off the balance sheet. We have 700 billion euros($781 billion) of non-performing loans, half of that in southern Europe, 30 percent in Italy so we need to clean up." Italian policymakers and European Union (EU) officials have been pondering how to improve Italy's fragile banking system in recent months, which has been bogged down by non-performing loans estimated to total around 360 billion euros ($401 billion).

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search JPMorgan’s Capital Market Assumptions Suggest a New Type of Portfolio Construction September 6, 2016 11:11am NYSE:JPM ShareTweet A number of asset managers publish their long-term capital market assumptions on at least an annual basis.  For the unfamiliar, capital market assumptions present an individual’s or firm’s view on asset class returns, volatilities, and correlations. Typically, we tend to be skeptical of these types of forecasts.  Not because we think capital market assumptions are useless, but rather because they are often presented as truths instead of assumptions. That being said, we are big fans of J.P. Morgan’s capital market assumption piece.  They published the 20th anniversary version of their outlook in October of last year. There are three things that really set J.P. Morgan’s work apart. They do not suffer from black box syndrome. The assumptions are not presented devoid of any context as to where they came from.  Instead, they go into quite a bit of detail on their methodology and the beliefs that form the foundation of their forecasts.  This transparency is crucial.  It allows investors to use the assumptions in a thoughtful, informed way.For example, the following graphic presents their forecasts for the evolution of cash interest rates in the United States, United Kingdom, Eurozone, and Japan over the next fifteen years.  If you agree with their beliefs, great.  If you don’t, you don’t have to throw away their capital market assumptions.  Instead, you could adjust the assumptions based on how you think cash rates with evolve. They recognize the limitations of normality. Post-2008, most investors seem to now be aware that many asset class returns are not normal, but instead exhibit “fat tails.” By summarizing asset class behavior with expected returns, volatilities, and correlations, most sets of capital market assumptions either ignore this reality or try to adjust for it in their volatility/correlation estimates in some non-transparent way. J.P. Morgan tackles the problem head-on, including a six-page article titled “Modelling and managing fat-tailed market risks.” The article starts on page 36 of the full document. They hold themselves accountable by comparing their past projections to the market reality that actually unfolded subsequent to publication.  To date, actual market returns have been statistically consistent with J.P. Morgan projections. All of this being said, we do find J.P. Morgan’s piece to be a bit lacking when it comes to laying out simple, actionable takeaways for portfolio construction. Now, this very well could be intentional and so is not meant as a criticism.  However, we thought it would make sense to explore what J.P. Morgan’s asset class views imply for portfolio construction. Quick sidebar: This commentary is not an endorsement by Newfound of J.P. Morgan’s views.  While we agree with much of what they say, we have disagreements as well.  Instead, this commentary is meant to explore the implications for portfolio construction if J.P. Morgan’s assumptions are accurate.  All capital market assumptions discussed come from J.P. Morgan Asset Management as of September 30, 2015 except for hedge fund returns and indices, which are as of June 30, 2015.  Capital market assumptions are – as the name states – assumptions and are not a guarantee of future performance.  Traditional Stock/Bond Risk Profiles Are Suboptimal… Constraining portfolios to only stocks and bonds is costly in today’s market environment. Using J.P. Morgan’s assumptions, we can significantly improve the efficient frontier by removing asset class constraints and considering a full palette of investment options.  For example, J.P. Morgan estimates a 6.0% expected return and 10.6% volatility for a 60/40 portfolio of global stocks (MSCI ACWI) and U.S. core bonds (Barclays Aggregate). For the same 10.6% target volatility, the expected return rises by 1.1% to 7.1% when we consider unconstrained access to the full universe. Source: Capital market assumptions from J.P. Morgan.  Optimization performed by Newfound Research using a simulation-based process to account for parameter uncertainty.  Certain asset classes listed in J.P. Morgan’s capital market assumptions were not considered because they were either (i) redundant due to other asset classes that were included or (ii) difficult to access outside of private or non-liquid investment vehicles. 1.1% of extra annual return is meaningful.  However, flipping the perspective gives even better context. On the full frontier where all asset classes are considered, how much volatility do we need to take on to achieve the same 6.0% expected return as the traditional 60/40 portfolio?  The answer: 6.5%, a nearly 40% reduction in volatility just from taking off the asset class handcuffs. The Takeaway: Passive, market-cap weighted stock/bond allocation profiles ignore macroeconomics, fundamentals, valuations, and risk and so may be non-optimal.    …But Doing Better Than Traditional Stock/Bond Risk Profiles Means Stomaching Tracking Error Like anything in life, this potential improvement does not come free.  In this case, the most stomach-churning cost – assuming that the capital market assumptions are accurate – likely comes from tracking error since the unconstrained portfolios would almost surely be benchmarked against their traditional counterparts. We computed the tracking error between unconstrained portfolios on the efficient frontier and traditional MSCI ACWI / Barclays Aggregate portfolios with the same target volatility.  In this context, positive (negative) numbers imply that the unconstrained portfolio outperforms (underperforms).  Below, we use this data to plot a 90% confidence interval for the annual return differential between the two approaches. Source: Capital market assumptions from J.P. Morgan.  Optimization performed by Newfound Research using a simulation-based process to account for parameter uncertainty.  Certain asset classes listed in J.P. Morgan’s capital market assumptions were not considered because they were either (i) redundant due to other asset classes that were included or (ii) difficult to access outside of private or non-liquid investment vehicles.    Sidebar: You might be wondering why in the graph above the leftmost column is labeled as a 4/96 stock/bond portfolio instead of a 0/100 stock/bond portfolio.  We use the 4/96 portfolio since this is the minimum volatility profile assuming that the allocation decision is only between the MSCI ACWI and Barclays Aggregate Bond.  In other words, a 0/100 portfolio is actually more volatility using J.P. Morgan’s assumptions than a 0/100, so we use the 4/96 as our lowest risk comparison point.     Let’s return to our 60% MSCI ACWI / 40% Barclays Aggregate Bond example to understand exactly what this means.  As we mentioned before, the volatility of this portfolio – using J.P. Morgan’s capital market assumptions – is 10.6%.  An unconstrained portfolio, targeting the same 10.6% volatility, is expected to outperform by 1.1%. However, this expected outperformance comes with tracking error of 3.4%.  The 90% confidence interval ranges from -4.5% to 5.6%.  In non-statistical language, this means that while we expect the unconstrained portfolio to outperform by 1.1%, this is by no means a guarantee.  The actual performance differential will vary year-by-year.  The confidence interval implies that we can be 90% confident that the actual outcome will range from the unconstrained model underperforming by 4.5% to the unconstrained modeloutperforming by 5.6%. Quite a range of possibilities! Another way to think about this issue is through the lens of underperformance probability.  Assuming that J.P. Morgan’s assumptions are correct – i.e. the unconstrained portfolio really is expected to outperform on average – what is the likelihood that the unconstrained portfolio underperforms its traditional counterpart over various holding periods? For a 1-year holding period, the probability of underperforming is not much less than the probability of losing a coin flip.  For longer holding periods, the chances of underperforming declines, but still remains meaningful.  The unconstrained portfolio has a 29%, 23%, and 15% probability of underperforming the traditional 60/40 over 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year holding periods, respectively. Source: Capital market assumptions from J.P. Morgan.  Optimization performed by Newfound Research using a simulation-based process to account for parameter uncertainty.  Certain asset classes listed in J.P. Morgan’s capital market assumptions were not considered because they were either (i) redundant due to other asset classes that were included or (ii) difficult to access outside of private or non-liquid investment vehicles.    The Takeaway: For optimized portfolios to be better than traditional stock/bond risk profiles, they must be different.  Allocation differences create tracking error and the possibility of underperformance, especially over shorter time horizons.    Satellite Fixed Income Is King The reason for the tracking error discussed in the last section becomes obvious when we look under the hood of the unconstrained frontier. Source: Capital market assumptions from J.P. Morgan.  Optimization performed by Newfound Research using a simulation-based process to account for parameter uncertainty.  Certain asset classes listed in J.P. Morgan’s capital market assumptions were not considered because they were either (i) redundant due to other asset classes that were included or (ii) difficult to access outside of private or non-liquid investment vehicles.    The optimized portfolio with 60/40 equivalent volatility has only 35% core stocks and 3% core bonds with the remaining 62% split between satellite fixed income (e.g. high yield corporates, high yield municipals, emerging market bonds, levered loans) and alternatives.  A similar pattern emerges for other volatility levels. Interesting results include: Core fixed income is significantly underweight relative to traditional risk profiles. For most conservative risk profiles, alternatives serve as a risk management complement to core fixed income without the return drag from historically low interest rates. Equities are also significantly underweight. When equities do enter the portfolios, there is a major bias towards international equities and away from U.S. equities. Satellite fixed income is king.  These asset classes, many of which exhibit hybrid fixed income/equity characteristics, have decidedly un-satellite-like allocations.  They help carry the risk mitigation burden of core bonds and the return generation burden of core stocks. The Takeaway: Most investors need both return generators and risk mitigators in their portfolio.  Historically, core stocks and bonds have slotted nicely into these roles.  Going forward, it is becoming increasingly important to look to other asset classes (e.g. satellite fixed income) and strategies (e.g. managed futures, equity long/short) to fulfill these roles.  Practical Considerations In reality, a moderate allocation portfolio with 2% invested in U.S. equities is problematic.  Almost all investors exhibit favoritism towards their home markets, and U.S. investors are no different.  This home market bias means that the considerable tracking error that the unconstrained portfolio would have to U.S. equities could create behavioral problems. Even if we were 100% sure of the accuracy of these assumptions – and therefore the long-term efficacy of our portfolio – having U.S. equities as a core reference point may create considerable short-run anxiety during periods our optimized portfolio underperforms.  Ultimately, a portfolio is only long-term optimal if we can have the discipline to stick with it in the short-run. This is, of course, all before we even consider we can never actually be sure that any set of capital market assumptions, no matter how thoughtfully constructed, fully and accurately represent asset class behavior.  Uncertainty around these assumptions is just another form of model risk. Managing these behavioral and model risks is a combination of art and science.  On the science front, we can employ optimization techniques that explicitly account for parameter uncertainty.  On the art front, we may wish to blend a number of complementary allocation approaches.  For a traditional “60/40” investor, this may mean something like this: 1/3rd allocation to market-cap weighted, passive “60/40” reference portfolio. 1/3rd allocation to unconstrained, long-term optimized portfolio using capital market assumptions (here we continue to use J.P. Morgan assumptions). 1/3rd allocation to tactical asset allocation (for the example, we use an equally weighted combination of our Risk Managed Global Sectors, Multi-Asset Income, and Total Return strategies). As of today, the individual sleeve and overall portfolio allocations would look something like this: Allocations are presented as an illustrative example of how an investor may think of portfolio construction.  Allocations are subject to change and should not be considered investment advice.  Client Talking Points Based on J.P. Morgan’s outlook, investors looking to maximize success over the next decade must look beyond core stocks and bonds. For these forward-looking investors, satellite fixed income asset classes like high yield bonds may offer valuable diversification without necessarily sacrificing return since they offer attractive yields. Alternatives, especially those strategies with a focus on risk management, can be attractive risk mitigators in a low-interest rate environment where large allocations to core bonds, the classic risk mitigator, will likely drag down overall portfolio returns. Employing forward-looking asset allocations generally means deviating from traditional stock/bond risk profiles. To be better, we have to be different.  Allocation differences will inevitably lead to periods of short-term underperformance.  Successfully implementing a forward-looking asset allocation means having appropriate expectations as well as the discipline to stick with it through periods of underperformance.

"QE reduces lending rates to negative and we are going to expect negative lending rates until 2021," Kian Abouhossein, head of European banks equity research at JPMorgan told CNBC Tuesday. "So as long as that is the case, margins will not improve. Sixty percent of revenues is net interest income and as long as that's the case earnings will not improve. So return on equity is very low." Balance sheet recession European banks are more akin to their Japanese counterparts and less like Wall Street, warns JPMorgan, who has detailed how a negative interest rate policy has led to ongoing pressure on revenues and profit margins. Europe has seen a balance sheet recession since the economic crisis of 2008, it said, highlighting that a 10.9 percent increase in reserves at these banks has failed to increase lending to the wider economy. "QE has worked initially and helped to stabilize asset prices, and to lower funding cost for banks …. However, the secondary long-term effects of QE are manifesting themselves in the form of pressure on revenues for European Banks with customer margins in euro area declining from 2.5 percent in 2011 to 1.8 percent in 2015," the report said. The European Central Bank (ECB), the Danish National Bank (DNB), the Swedish Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) have all pushed key short-term policy rates into negative territory. A negative interest rate policy, or NIRP, essentially charges banks to hold cash at a central bank in the hope that they will instead lend to the real economy. Many expect banks to pass on this disincentive to save to its customers by trimming rates or by ramping up borrowing costs. The policy is increasingly being seen as a viable option for central bankers after Japan's move below zero earlier this year. QE infinity Kazuhiro Hogi | AFP | Getty Images A pedestrian walks past an electric quotation board displaying the rate of the Japanese yen against the US dollar (R) in Tokyo on July 29, 2016. Tokyo shares rose on July 29 with lenders boosted by the Bank of Japan's decision not to cut interest rates further into negative territory. While this stimulates growth in some cases, negative rates put pressure on other sectors of the economy. A number of leading analysts have called for a balance of monetary and fiscal measures in order to slowly get the economy out of "QE infinity" – a paradox whereby low rates and seemingly endless rounds of bond-buying programs encourage cheap borrowing. Alberto Gallo, head of macro strategies and manager of the Algebris Macro Credit Fund, told CNBC last week that for the global economy to exit this QE infinity trap, government action and reforms to improve productivity are needed. "Many governments are reluctant to accept the need for these measures, often instead implementing policies that win votes but compound the distortions of easy monetary policy e.g. housing affordability programmes, mortgage subsidies," he said. Without an adequate fiscal response from governments, growing imbalances make it harder to withdraw stimulus, warned Gallo. The NPL problem However, profit margins are not the only problems that banks in Europe are facing currently. "There are two factors," Abouhossein told CNBC. "Operationally it is cost cutting and second is finding a price for non-performing loans. Non-performing loans need to come off the balance sheet. We have 700 billion euros($781 billion) of non-performing loans, half of that in southern Europe, 30 percent in Italy so we need to clean up." Italian policymakers and European Union (EU) officials have been pondering how to improve Italy's fragile banking system in recent months, which has been bogged down by non-performing loans estimated to total around 360 billion euros ($401 billion).

WASHINGTON (TNS) — For millions of Americans, a reminder of the economic damage of the 2007-09 recession has arrived every week or two for years — in their paychecks. Painfully slow wage growth has limited economic recovery, with many workers getting few if any raises. But there are signs that has started to change. The falling unemployment rate has led to more competition for workers, spurring solid gains in average hourly earnings in recent months. Those pressures, amplified by laws providing minimum-wage increases in California, New York and elsewhere, also are triggering changes for the workers who need raises the most. Beginning last year, large companies such as Wal-Mart, Starbucks, McDonald’s and JPMorgan Chase increased what they pay their lowest-level employees. “A pay increase is the right thing to do,” JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said recently in announcing raises that would bring the hourly pay of bank tellers, customer service representatives and other employees to at least $12 an hour in three years, from the current $10.15. “Wages for many Americans have gone nowhere for too long,” he wrote in a New York Times opinion article. The same message has emanated from the presidential campaigns of Republicans and Democrats. When adjusted for inflation, median annual household incomes declined to $53,657 in 2014, the most recent year for which government data are available, from $57,724 in 2000. “Household incomes are more than $4,000 lower than their levels in the year 2000,” Republican nominee Donald Trump said at a rally in Virginia last month. “Think of it … you’re making $4,000 less now than you did 16, 17 years ago.” Wage growth already was taking a hit this century for several reasons. One factor is the loss of bargaining power caused by a drop in the share of private-sector unionized workers; another is the decline in higher-paying manufacturing jobs as companies moved more factories abroad. As a result, the share of money flowing into households from wages began falling sharply compared with capital income from interest and dividends, according to a study last year by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The 2008 financial crisis and the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression amplified those changes, further stifling overall wage growth. But after two years of strong job growth, job openings are near record levels. That’s forced employers to raise pay to attract new workers and retain existing ones, economists said. Average hourly earnings increased 2.4 percent for the 12 months ended Aug. 31. Annual wage gains have been consistently in that range since last fall — they reached a seven-year high of 2.7 percent year-over-year in July — an improvement from the tepid 2 percent during much the first six years of the recovery. With annual inflation running below 1 percent, the accelerating wage growth is boosting workers’ purchasing power. In addition, more middle-income jobs are being created than was the case earlier in the economic recovery, indicating that wage gains are being spread more evenly among the workforce. From 2010 to 2013, new jobs that paid between about $30,000 and $50,000 annually lagged well behind high- and low-wage positions, according to research released recently by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But from 2013-15, the U.S. added about 2.3 million middle-income jobs in fields such as construction, education, and transportation. During the same period, the economy created about 1.5 million high-paying jobs and about 1.6 million low-paying jobs. Some states and localities have tried to accelerate wage recovery for low-income workers by raising minimum wages. There now are 29 states, plus the District of Columbia, that have minimum wages higher than the federal level of $7.25 an hour, which hasn’t budged since 2009. In April, California Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that will raise the minimum wage in California to $15 an hour by 2022. Also in April, New York enacted legislation that will raise the minimum wage there to $15. The increases vary by region — faster for New York City, slower for more rural areas — and it is unclear when the entire state will hit that level. As the states with the nation’s largest and third-largest populations moved to increase their minimum wages, large companies realized that they’d soon have to raise the pay of many of their workers. That was one factor behind the nationwide pay raises that several began announcing last year. “We certainly are mindful of wage increases in various states throughout the country,” McDonald’s chief financial officer Kevin M. Ozan said during an earnings call in July “It has, from a purely business standpoint, created an incentive to lift the wages at the bottom across their workforces,” said Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, which has been pushing for a $15-an-hour minimum wage. “A lot of companies … were getting a lot of bad press about how they treated their employees, and raising wages was an obvious way to respond to that,” she said. Early last year, Wal-Mart became the first major employer to announce raises for its lowest-paid workers. It now pays them at least $10 an hour once they finish the company’s training program. Wal-Mart is spending $2.7 billion over two years to increase pay, bringing the average full-time hourly rate for its workers to $13.38. Brett Biggs, the company’s chief financial officer, predicted the investment “will pay off long-term.” “Whether it’s lower attrition rates in the stores, better motivated associates, we think we’ll see the benefits from that,” he told an investor conference in June. Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz cited similar reasons after announcing this summer that the company would raise base pay for its workers by at least 5 percent in October. The company’s baristas earn an average of about $9.40 an hour, according to Glassdoor. “What we want to try and do is really get ahead of any federal or state mandate to be the employer of choice,” Schultz told analysts on an earnings call in July. After saying last year that he opposed an increase in the federal minimum wage, Trump this summer said he thought it should be raised to at least $10. The Democratic Party’s official platform calls for increasing the federal minimum wage to $15. “Raising the federal minimum wage won’t just put more money in the pockets of low-income families, it also means they will spend more at the businesses in their neighborhoods,” Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton told a Michigan crowd last month. “We need to get incomes and wages rising, and it will help the whole economy grow and be fairer.” Tags Wage Worker Employee Company Gain Minimum Wage Job MARC WEHRS Follow MARC WEHRS Close Get email notifications on MARC WEHRS daily!

Regina H. Boone/Detroit Free Press (Photo: Regina H. Boone, Detroit Free Press)Buy Photo The Detroit Jazz Festival has always celebrated the city's remarkable jazz heritage as a core value. But the 37th annual event, which came to a close Monday evening with a vivacious performance by the Ron Carter Great Big Band at Hart Plaza, felt even more connected to the city's tradition than usual. There are some lessons here. Carter, 79, the influential Detroit-bred bassist who served as the 2016 artist-in-residence, is only the second hometown hero to have occupied the position. The other is violinist Regina Carter (no relation), who inaugurated the program in 2007. Having Ron Carter as the face of the festival, the cornerstone of its artistic and marketing efforts for the year, and performing once a day at the helm of different ensembles kept reminding audiences in the most powerful way possible that Detroiters live on hallowed ground. ►Related: Saturday at the Detroit Jazz Festival: A critic on the move ►Related: Ron Carter opens Detroit Jazz Fest -- a jazz 'Super Bowl' As the city reinvents itself, it's important that it builds on its strengths. Music — particularly African-American idioms with jazz as a baseline — remains critical to the city's cultural identity, and it belongs in any blueprint for the future. Having one Detroiter as the festival's artist-in-residence every nine or 10 years isn't enough — not in a city that since the middle of the 20th Century has been turning out more world-class jazz musicians than practically any other. Of course, not every great player would necessarily make a great artist-in-residence. The job requires a certain kind of multi-layered artistic expansiveness, gravitas, collaborative mind-set and a willingness to truly commit to the event. Among those with Detroit roots I'd be mulling if I were festival director Chris Collins would be pianist-composer Geri Allen, alto saxophonists Charles McPherson and Kenny Garrett and tenor saxophonist James Carter (again, no relation). Ron Carter wore the mantle with authority over the weekend, turning in terrific performances, including an especially divine set by his quartet on Saturday with the always-inventive pianist Renee Rosnes riding shotgun. He also revealed a conceptual streak with his nonet, a band that positions his piccolo bass as the sole "horn," with a conventional rhythm section and four cellists alongside. I don't think such a dulcet-toned ensemble is cut out for an outdoor festival, particularly opening night, but it's a credit to Detroit audiences that they hung right in there with every quiet note. Ron Carter plays his double bass at the opening of the Detroit Jazz Festival on Friday, Sept. 2, 2016 in downtown Detroit. Born in Ferndale, Carter is among jazz's most widely-recorded bassists. Now 79, Carter has been playing upright stringed instruments since the age of 10.  (Photo: Lex Dodson, Special to the Free Press) On another front, the multifaceted festival tribute to the late Kenn Cox provides a model for similar efforts going forward. Cox was a Detroit pianist, composer and mentor and the key driver of the city's Contemporary Jazz Quintet in the 1960s and '70s, a band that still has a national cult following among musicians to this day. On Saturday, CJQ bassist Ron Brooks led a quintet before a 12-piece ensemble excavated rarely heard eight-horn arrangements (including tuba) that Cox did during the '70s and '80s, when he was a true cultural warrior. The group of mostly former Cox associates needed more rehearsal, but love was in the air. On Sunday, New York trumpeter David Weiss, who prepared the arrangements for the performance, led his own Point of Departure sextet (including two guitarists) through beguiling CJQ material like Cox's "Sojourn" and the late Charles Moore's "Number Four." The band's stream-of-consciousness playing was long-winded, but it sounded fresh: a 21st-Century spin on the CJQ's post-bop style that itself was modeled on the open, modal forms of the Miles Davis Quintet of the late '60s. Detroit-born tenor saxophonist JD Allen was the most satisfying soloist. Bassist Matt Clohesy and the relentless drummer Kush Abadey kept shifting grooves without losing momentum. The festival's deep dive into Cox's music — like the continuous presence of Carter and other details such as the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra's Sunday set devoted mostly to the innovative compositions and arrangements of the Pontiac-born legend Thad Jones — allowed the spirit of Detroit jazz to watch over the weekend like a guardian angel. I wouldn't go so far as to credit this for the four days of perfect weather and large crowds. But to put a local spin on a favorite saying of jazz impresario Todd Barkan: Take care of Detroit jazz, and it will take care of you. Other highlights and notes from the weekend: Best Set, Small Band Division: Stanley Cowell's quintet with incendiary tenor saxophonist Billy Harper and trumpeter Charles Tolliver on the front line on Saturday offered the most intense music of the weekend. It merged a connoisseur lineup and adventurous profile with the kind of energy and honesty that anyone, expert or novice, could relate to, and it conjured up the spiritually minded post-John Coltrane post-bop of the '70s by the players who helped create the sound in the first place. Cowell's solos were full of startling originality. Bassist Jay Anderson and drummer Carl Allen completed the group. (Pyramid Stage, Hart Plaza) Best Set, Large Band Division: It was thrilling to hear the music of Thad Jones played Sunday by the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra — the current incarnation of the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Jazz Orchestra founded in New York in 1966 — on Sunday in downtown Detroit, about five miles from the Blue Bird Inn on the west side, where Jones cut his teeth in the '50s. After using Jim McNeely's "Thad," which quotes from myriad Jones classics, as a kind of overture, the band dove into the suite-like "Central Park North," one of Jones' most formally adventurous works, loaded with expressive dissonance, a Jones trademark. The program list also included the expansive "My Centennial" and wildly imaginative takes on standards "All of Me" and "I Love You." The latter was a mini-concerto for an inspired Dick Oats on alto saxophone. Bob Brookmeyer's "Rich" (featuring the snaky ruminations of tenor man Rich Perry) completed the set. Having lived with this music for decades, the veteran-laden band phrased as one, swinging with a beautiful sense of proportion and dynamics. Strong solos across the board. (Main Stage, Cadillac Square) Most Sublime Moment: Ron Carter's quartet with pianist Renee Rosnes, drummer Peyton Crossley and percussionist Rolando Morales-Matos floated through a hallucinatory version of Miles Davis and Bill Evans' "Flamenco Sketches" on Saturday. Every time the harmony cycled into the Spanish-sounding Phrygian mode, percussion subtly transported the band to a bullfight. The song segued quietly into Luiz Bonfá's "Samba de Orpheus," a set piece for Carter in which his rich sound and deceptively simple rhythmic, melodic and harmonic wrinkles distilled the music down to its essence. (Pyramid Stage) You Can Go Home Again, But It's Not Always Easy: A homecoming trio of pianist Kirk Lightsey, drummer Louis Hayes and bassist Robert Hurst got off to a shaky start on Sunday. At 79, Hayes, an all-time great, is not as consistent as he used to be. But he found the pocket on a bluesy and swinging "Fe-Fi-Fo-Fum" by Wayne Shorter and the music snapped to attention and stayed dialed in for the rest of the set. Hurst's arco treatment of the ballad "My One and Only Love" was a highlight, as was the basssist's unerring pulse, the melodic character of Lightsey's solos and accompaniment and the lightly tippin' groove of Hayes'  cymbal beat and brushes. (Amphitheater, Hart Plaza) Best Use of Strings: Five bands made substantial use of strings, from quartets to full orchestras. Especially rewarding was saxophonist and composer Chris Potter on Saturday seamlessly integrating a string quartet into "Imaginary Cities," an ambitious suite for his 11-member Underground Orchestra that traversed an electric-acoustic fault line. (Amphitheater) History Lesson:  What was most striking about the Monday set by pianist Jason Moran & the Bandwagon (bassist Tarus Mateen and dummer Nasheet Waits) was the way the players collapsed a century of African-American vernacular music into the present tense. They took themes by Fats Waller, Thelonious Monk, Ornette Coleman and Moran, along with rural blues and ran everything through an encyclopedia of rhythmic grooves, textures and languages — from Harlem stride to swing to bebop to hip-hop. Also in the mix were electronics, sampled voices and furious keyboard broadsides that had Moran sweeping across the piano in waves of abstraction. The music was rich with ideas, emotion and in-the-moment revelation. (Water Front Stage, Hart Plaza) Best Line: Trombonist John Mosca introducing the members of the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra: "I think you'll find it's easier to buy the guys a drink if you know their names (pregnant pause). We'll start with the guys who are still drinking." (Main Stage) Home Sweet Home: The infectious spirit and joy that 84-year-old tenor saxophonist and clarinetist Charlie Gabriel brought to the festival on Monday was a reminder of how much his adopted home of Detroit misses his presence following his return to his native New Orleans a number of years ago. Come back more often, Charlie. (Pyramid Stage) Missed Opportunity: Vocalist and guitarist George Benson gave the masses what they came for on opening night Friday, offering polished renditions of his hits from the get-go, among them "Breezin'," "Turn Your Love Around," "Kisses in the Moonlight" and others. But there were too many sappy R&B ballads and constrictive back beats for my taste. Benson — one of the great jazz guitarists of our time — could have easily mixed in some no-nonsense jazz material and improvisation. C'mon, George. This is Detroit! Having said that, he unleashed a tornado guitar solo on "Mambo Inn" that was full of his lickety-split lines, gleaming tone and blues elocutions. It was as exciting as any solo I heard all weekend. (Cadillac Square) Biggest Surprise: I had heard a little of singer Charenee Wade on recordings, so I was aware of the rich opulence of her voice and the way she has drawn from singers like Betty Carter and Abby Lincoln without mortgaging her own individuality. But I wasn't prepared for the depth of expression and vibrancy that her big personality projects on stage. The portion of her Sunday set that I heard — in which she and a simpatico band reinterpreted material by Gil-Scott Heron — was off-the-charts, and it had me heading for the CD booth. (Pyramid Stage) Best Segue: David Weiss and Point of Departure opened their Sunday set devoted primarily to the music of Detroiters Kenn Cox and Charles Moore with Wayne Shorter’s “Paraphernalia.” The song was a staple of Miles Davis’ late ‘60s quintet, and its shifting meter and amorphous harmony had seismic impact on Cox and Moore and their Contemporary Jazz Quintet. In a savvy move, Weiss and company connected the dots by sliding from “Paraphernalia” directly into Cox’s “Sojourn.” (Water Front Stage) Carter’s Long Shadow: In addition to hearing countless reflections of Ron Carter’s bass sound and concept in the playing of others throughout the weekend, there was one three-hour block on Sunday in which three different bands played three different compositions that Carter originally recorded with Miles Davis’ quintet (Wayne Shorter’s “Paraphernalia” and “Pinocchio” and Tony Williams’ “Pee Wee”).

Forward-Looking Statements – Cautionary Language Certain statements made in this release and in other written or oral statements made by us or on our behalf are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("PSLRA"). A forward-looking statement is a statement that is not a historical fact and, without limitation, includes any statement that may predict, forecast, indicate or imply future results, performance or achievements, and may contain words like:  "believe," "anticipate," "expect," "estimate," "aim," "predict," "potential," "continue," "plan," "project," "will," "should," "shall," "may," "might" and other words or phrases with similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our businesses, prospective services, future performance or financial results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. We claim the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA. These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events.  Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements.  Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements, include, among others: certain risks and uncertainties associated with the proposed acquisition of Valence Health, including: revenues of Valence Health before and after the merger may be less than expected, and expected results of Evolent may not be impacted as anticipated; uncertainties related to the timing of the receipt of required regulatory approvals for the merger; the ability of Evolent and Valence Health to satisfy the closing conditions of the merger; the occurrence of any change that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; our ability to implement integration plans for the merger and to recognize the anticipated growth, benefits, cost savings and synergies of the merger; the risks that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement disrupt current plans and operations and the potential difficulties in retention of any members of senior management of Valence Health and any other key employees that Evolent is interested in retaining after the closing of the merger; the limitations placed on the ability of Evolent and Valence Health to operate their respective businesses by the merger agreement; the effect of the announcement of the merger on Evolent's and Valence Health's business relationships, customers, suppliers, other partners, standing with regulators, operating results and businesses generally; the amount of any costs, fees, expenses, impairments and charges related to the merger; and the market price for our Class A common stock potentially being affected, following the merger, by factors that historically have not affected the market price for our Class A common stock; the structural change in the market for health care in the United States; our ability to effectively manage our growth; the significant portion of revenue we derive from our largest partners; our ability to offer new and innovative products and services; the growth and success of our partners, which is difficult to predict and is subject to factors outside of our control, including premium pricing reductions and the ability to control and, if necessary, reduce health care costs; our ability to attract new partners; our ability to recover the significant upfront costs in our partner relationships; our ability to estimate the size of our target market; our ability to maintain and enhance our reputation and brand recognition; consolidation in the health care industry; competition which could limit our ability to maintain or expand market share within our industry; our ability to partner with providers due to exclusivity provisions in our contracts; uncertainty in the health care regulatory framework; restrictions and penalties as a result of privacy and data protection laws; adequate protection of our intellectual property; any alleged infringement, misappropriation or violation of third-party proprietary rights; our use of "open source" software; our ability to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information; our reliance on third parties; our ability to use, disclose, de-identify or license data and to integrate third-party technologies; data loss or corruption due to failures or errors in our systems and service disruptions at our data centers; breaches or failures of our security measures; our reliance on Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties and our own systems for providing services to our users; our dependency on our key personnel, and our ability to attract, hire, integrate and retain key personnel; risks related to future acquisition opportunities; the risk of potential future goodwill impairment on our results of operations; our future indebtedness and our ability to obtain additional financing; our ability to achieve profitability in the future; the requirements of being a public company; our adjusted results may not be representative of our future performance; the risk of potential future litigation; our ability to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting; our holding company structure and dependence on distributions from Evolent Health LLC; our obligations to make payments to certain of our pre-IPO investors for certain tax benefits we may claim in the future; our ability to utilize benefits under the tax receivables agreement; our ability to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that we currently expect to result from future exchanges of Class B common units of Evolent Health LLC for our Class A common stock, and to utilize certain tax attributes of Evolent Health Holdings and an affiliate of TPG; distributions that Evolent Health LLC will be required to make to us and to the other members of Evolent Health LLC; our obligations to make payments under the tax receivables agreement that may be accelerated or may exceed the tax benefits we realize; different interests among our pre-IPO investors, or between us and our pre-IPO investors; the terms of agreements between us and certain of our pre-IPO investors; our exemption from certain corporate governance requirements due to our status as a "controlled company" within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules; the potential volatility of our Class A common stock price; the potential decline of our Class A common stock price if a substantial number of shares become available for sale or if a large number of Class B common units is exchanged for shares of Class A common stock; provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws and provisions of Delaware law that discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of us; the ability of certain of our investors to compete with us without restrictions; provisions in our certificate of incorporation which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees; our intention not to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock; and our status as an "emerging growth company." The risks included here are not exhaustive.  Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements.  Our 2015 Form 10-K and other documents filed with the SEC include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors. Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

JPMorgan Chase is strong and steady. Wells Fargo is seen as the best managed and most innovative. Joe Morgan via Wikipedia By James K. Glassman, Contributing Columnist From Kiplinger's Personal Finance, October 2016 UPDATE: In the column below that appeared in the October 2016 issue of Kiplinger’s Personal Finance, I recommended all four of the largest U.S. banks. One of those was Wells Fargo. Since then, Wells has been embroiled in what can only be called a disgusting scandal. The bank fired 5,300 employees for opening about 2 million fake accounts, going back to 2011, and has announced that CEO John Stumpf will forfeit about $45 million in compensation as a sort of punishment. Wells shares have dropped from $48 to $45 since I recommended them. Do I continue to recommend the stock? Absolutely not. Mistakes and individual misbehavior, I can tolerate, but systemic fraud, I can’t. It’s rarely an isolated event. Why own this tainted company when there are so many good ones out there? In normal times, banking is a nice business—not hugely profitable, but consistently so. Banks borrow money, mainly by taking deposits, and pay interest for the privilege. Then they turn around and lend that money to businesses, governments and individuals at a higher rate of interest. The difference between those two rates (after accounting for expenses such as rent and salaries) is a bank’s profit. For the past 30 years, that difference for U.S. banks has bounced between three and five percentage points. That might not sound like much, but with billions of dollars in deposits, serious money is involved. See Also: Is There a Bubble in Dividend Stocks? Advertisement For banks, the cost of borrowing money has been extremely low lately, as anyone with a savings account knows. But the price that banks get for lending money has been extremely low as well. A recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that the average net interest margin (NIM)—that is, the difference between the rate at which banks lend and borrow—for U.S. banks is about three percentage points, which is near a historical low. In 2008, the NIM was 3.3 percentage points, and in the early 1990s it was nearly five points. For the big banks, which compete vigorously for large corporate customers, today’s interest margin is even lower. At the end of June, JPMorgan Chase (symbol JPM), the nation’s largest bank, reported an NIM of just 2.25 points. A small rise in NIM goes a long way. With about $800 billion in loans, Chase would boost its after-tax profit by $8 billion—or by more than one-fourth of its 2015 earnings—if its NIM were to climb by one percentage point. Unfortunately for banks, they have little control over the rates at which they borrow; those are set by the Federal Reserve and the market as a whole. The Fed has been reluctant to raise rates in an economy that remains sluggish nearly eight years after the end of the Great Recession. Banks traditionally do have some influence over the rates they charge borrowers, but the primary way they can boost rates is by taking on riskier loans. Because of concerns about repeating the mistakes of the past, both banks and their regulators have become highly averse to assuming credit risk. Cream of the crop. Still, some banks have performed well in recent years. The best of them, such as JPMorgan Chase, have boosted the bottom line by increasing the size of their loan portfolio and by cutting expenses. Chase’s lending was up 16% for the 12-month period that ended June 30, and, although revenues actually declined between 2011 and 2015, profits rose by one-third, thanks to lower costs. Advertisement Chase’s shareholders have been rewarded. The stock has more than quadrupled since the dark days of 2009, and over the past five years it returned 12.0% annualized. That’s 1.4 percentage points per year lower than Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, but it’s not bad for a highly regulated business. A good chunk of that return has come from a steadily rising dividend. In 2009, Chase slashed its dividend rate from $1.52 per share annually to just 20 cents. Its annual payout, after a 10% increase over the summer, now stands at a record $1.92 per share, and the stock, at today’s price of $64, yields a brisk 3.0%. (All returns and prices are as of July 31.) All the big banks have shored up their balance sheets since the financial meltdown, and government regulators have kept them on a tight leash, discouraging the kinds of loans and trading activity that were routine in the past. There’s little room for the kind of risk-taking or bold investing that mark sectors such as technology. Chase’s “common equity tier 1” ratio, the key measure of the buffer against another disaster, has risen from 7% in 2007 to 11.9% as of June 30. That’s an achievement, but it hasn’t changed the status of Chase and the other too-big-to-fail banks as practically wards of the state. “Banks cannot be utilities,” Jamie Dimon, Chase’s CEO, wrote in the company’s 2015 annual report. Because of the understandable fears of government officials and the public, however, that’s just what the giant banks have become. Chase is the largest of the four banks that dominate commercial banking. The others are Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC), each with about $2 trillion in assets. Besides lending, they all advise on mergers and acquisitions (M&A), manage mutual funds, underwrite bond issues, and trade currencies and other investments for their own accounts. My list excludes Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), which perform many of the same functions as the others but are mainly investment banks, focusing on such activities as M&A and underwriting rather than collecting deposits and making small loans. Advertisement The banks have different personalities. Chase is strong and steady. Wells, whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, is seen as the best managed and most innovative. Its stock has been the top performer over the past five years, with an annualized return of 14.0%. BofA and Citigroup suffered more during the financial crisis and still haven’t fully recovered. Neither has been profitable enough to raise its dividend to anywhere near pre-financial-crisis levels. (Citi’s stock yields just 0.7%; BofA’s, 1.4%.) Once a proud and powerful global bank, Citi has drastically reduced its footprint. It now has retail bank offices in 21 countries, down from 50 in 2007; over the same period, it cut the number of U.S. branches from 936 to 780. A large portfolio of mortgage-backed securities still burdens BofA. Low interest rates encourage borrowers to refinance, which can be particularly problematic for holders of mortgage securities. The bank’s second-quarter earnings fell 18% from the same quarter in 2015, and its return on equity (a measure of profitability) is the lowest of the four. A key measure of how investors view banks is the relationship between their share prices and book value, or net worth on the balance sheet. The figure reflects investors’ take on the real value of a bank’s loans and other assets. Both Citi and BofA stocks trade for about 40% less than their book values. Chase trades almost precisely at book value, and Wells trades at a one-third premium to book value. Of course, these valuations are measures of how the market assesses the banks today. As an investor, your concern is what will happen tomorrow. I like the future of all four big-bank stocks. Higher interest rates, waiting in the wings, will be the catalyst that drives up their share prices. Higher rates will likely lead to wider net interest margins and thus higher profits. Banks can continue to cut costs by closing branches and deploying new technologies. And although I am generally averse to heavy regulation, the constraints on banks have been largely beneficial. Advertisement Banks below the top tier also look like good buys now. My favorite way to invest in the sector is through Fidelity Select Banking (FSRBX), an actively managed mutual fund in which the big four banks, led by Wells, at 10.2% of assets, are among the top six holdings. Another good choice is SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE), an exchange-traded fund with a portfolio comprising about 60 large banks, none accounting for more than 3% of assets. I also like Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), a more diversified ETF that, in addition to bank stocks, holds insurers, asset managers and even real estate investment trusts. Or you can skip the funds and simply put the same amount of money into each of the big four banks. It looks like the time is right. James K.

Opinion 5.3k 0 0 September 7, 2016 Bernie Sanders, Jill Stein Oppose DAPL, So Where Is Hillary Clinton? Reno Berkeley The following article is entirely the opinion of Reno Berkeley and does not reflect the views of the Inquisitr. They say silence is worth its weight in gold, or in this case, crude oil. Members of various social media networks are loudly criticizing Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton for her silence concerning the Dakota Access Pipeline, or Bakken Pipeline, as it’s also known. Clinton’s former rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, has come out in strong opposition against the DAPL, calling it dangerous. Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein has joined the protesters in North Dakota, staying true to her activist roots. Energy comes in many forms. Water does not. #ReZpectOurWater #NoDAPL pic.twitter.com/EtTTs9ekmH — Dr. Jill Stein (@DrJillStein) September 7, 2016 So, where, everyone wants to know, is Hillary Clinton? Why has she remained silent in the face of one of the most contentious environmental protests in recent years? Actress and Bernie Sanders supporter Susan Sarandon has been one of Clinton’s most vocal critics, and the DAPL situation is no different. On September 6, Sarandon tweeted a section from Clinton’s website where she claims that she will support Native Americans. This is on ur website @HillaryClinton. Ur silence on the Dakota Access Pipeline is deafening. This is an emergency. pic.twitter.com/6SvCPKwtoE — Susan Sarandon (@SusanSarandon) September 6, 2016 “And Hillary will continue to stand for Tribal sovereignty and in support of Tribal resources and sacred sites.” Although some Clinton supporters have criticized Sarandon for questioning where their candidate’s loyalty lies, Sarandon has a point. No one but Clinton can say for sure why she has not come out in opposition to the DAPL, but one can deduce the reason for her silence by looking at her financials. @SenSanders @annaleclaire @MPRnews Where's Hillary, Bernie? — Shana Lin (@ShanaLin4) September 7, 2016 One of Clinton’s biggest contributors through SuperPACs is Goldman Sachs. Democracy Now has revealed that one of the DAPL’s major investors is — drumroll please — Goldman Sachs. During a show on September 6, Amy Goodman discussed this, and named several other DAPL investors. “A new investigation has revealed more than two dozen major banks and financial institutions are helping finance the Dakota Access pipeline, the investigation published by the research outlet LittleSis. It details how Bank of America, HSBC, UBS, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and other financial institutions have, combined, extended a $3.75 billion credit line to Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of Dakota Access.” This means that each of these banks wants a return on their investment, and they will not go quietly into the night. The DAPL construction began in May 2016, but once it hit North Dakota’s Standing Rock Sioux Tribal nation, the pipeline met with fierce resistance. Hillary Clinton will not likely not oppose the DAPL, or will skirt the issue when confronted. Her running mate, Tim Kaine, has already done so, telling 350 Action that he needs “more information” before he can decide whether to side with indigenous leaders or with the DAPL. BREAKING: @timkaine says he needs more info before siding with the indigenous leaders fighting #noDAPL. #nhpolitics pic.twitter.com/JgSeoughfk — 350 Action (@350action) September 1, 2016 Simon Moya-Smith, cultural editor of Indian Country Today and a member of the Oglala Lakota Nation, points out that the DAPL is a “clear violation of the Treaty of Fort Laramie,” which was signed in 1868 between the United States government and several Indian nations and tribes. “That document guarantees land, sovereignty, and hunting rights, and promises that the territory will be closed to all whites.” Moya-Smith has also questioned whether Clinton will oppose the DAPL and references her official stand on Native American issues where she promises to support indigenous peoples’ rights as sovereign. It is unlikely that Clinton will voice opposition against the DAPL, and if she does, it will be weak. Lee Fang and Steve Horn pointed out her hypocrisy in May regarding major polluters China and India. In the report, they reference a Clinton ad promising to protect New Yorkers from hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, ignoring the fact that during her time as Secretary of State she was an avid proponent of fracking in other nations around the world, including Poland. While fracking is different than transporting crude oil, it illustrates a pattern of Clinton’s, in which she appears to favor the fossil fuel industry. .ninaturner: RT MSNBC: Thousands protested at Standing Rock Sioux reservation over construction of oil pipeline … pic.twitter.com/wHWNf5hfUl — Berners 4 Jill Stein (@Vote4JillStein1) September 5, 2016 On September 6, the Wall Street Journal reported that Clinton had raised more money from people in the natural gas and oil industries than Donald Trump. “Individuals who work for oil and natural-gas companies donated $149,000 to Mr. Trump’s GOP campaign through July 30 … compared with $525,000 to Mrs. Clinton.” “The industry’s executives and employees have also donated $470,000 to a fundraising account Mr. Trump established … compared with $650,000 to a similar account Mrs. Clinton set up with Democrats.” Pipelines, whether they are underground or above ground, are notorious for their leaks. As the Inquisitr reported previously, between 1996 and 2015, nearly 12,000 pipeline incidents occurred with a total cost of nearly $6.9 billion. In 2015 alone, the United States experienced 708 pipeline incidents with 12 deaths, 49 injuries, and nearly $340 million in damages. Energy Transfer Partners, the main builder of the DAPL, knows that such pipelines are not immune to leaks, yet the company’s website claims they are safer than train transport. While the number of spills is lower with pipelines, the damage wreaked by such disasters is much worse. To compound this, the DAPL is set to be buried a mere three feet underground, and its own website states that the pipeline will run only 60 inches below waterways, such as the Missouri River. When an existing leg of the Keystone pipeline leaked earlier this year, then-candidate Senator Bernie Sanders was also critical of it. Another the Inquisitr report states that Sanders vowed to fight to protect the lands of Native Americans across the country, and while he is no longer running for president, his outspoken recriminations against the Keystone and DAPL have not gone unnoticed by supporters. Now that social media mavens have called Clinton out for her silence regarding the fight against the DAPL, it will be interesting to see whether she takes a stand on this issue and what it will be.

Photo / Qilai Shen China's got the world puzzling over its oil hoard. From underground caverns by the Yellow Sea to a scattering of islands in the Yangtze River delta, the government has been stockpiling crude for emergencies in a network of storage sites dotted around the country. Record purchases this year by the world's biggest energy consumer have helped oil prices recover from the worst crash in a generation. What the country plans to do next could determine where they go from here. The difficulty is that nobody outside China really knows for certain. The government won't say how much it's holding or when the tanks will be full. Energy Aspects says the country will probably keep buying and fill up commercial tanks if it has to, while the likes of JPMorgan Chase say the purchases may soon stop. The difference in opinion is equivalent to about 1.1 million barrels a day, or more than the Asian country buys from Saudi Arabia. "China seems to feel no obligation to report on its strategic stocks, and that might confer a genuine advantage in its favour," said John Driscoll, the chief strategist at JTD Energy Services, who has spent more than 30 years trading crude and petroleum in Singapore. "The scope of their purchases can dramatically affect fundamentals and prices. However, since they will likely be shrouded in secrecy, it will remain challenging to quantify the impact." China outlined in 2009 its plans to build reserves equivalent to 100 days of net imports. But since then it's only provided sporadic scraps of detail on its strategic petroleum reserves, or SPR. That stands in contrast to the US, where the Energy Department has been detailing data on American inventories for more than three decades. The Asian country had about 191 million barrels of crude in its SPR as of the middle of last year, according to a statement on the website of the National Bureau of Statistics in December. But it also said at the time that total combined capacity of seven above-ground sites and one location with underground caverns was the equivalent of only 180 million barrels. The figures haven't been updated since. Continued below. Related Content Comvita forms joint venture with China distributor The news story which saved China China Business: Zespri increases tempo in China The government also said at the time it has leased space in commercial sites, signalling it could buy additional oil while more of its own tanks are constructed. Nobody replied to a fax sent to the press office of the National Energy Administration asking for details about the SPR. China seems to feel no obligation to report on its strategic stocks, and that might confer a genuine advantage in its favour. "SPR has been a China mystery due to the lack of government data disclosure," said Ying Wang, a Hong Kong-based analyst at JPMorgan. The bank estimates the amount of crude China is putting into stockpiles by calculating how much more oil the country is buying and producing than it's using. That amounted to about 1.2 million barrels a day over the first half of the year, according to JPMorgan. The bank estimates the country built up a total of about 400 million barrels by mid-2016 out of a targeted 511 million barrels. That means at the current rate of stockpiling, the storage would be filled up by August, leading to a potential drop in imports in September. Energy Aspects looks at it differently. Because China can shift oil between commercial and strategic storage, the government may be able to increase purchases even if it runs out of its own space, said Michal Meidan, a London-based analyst for the industry consultant. Another 150 million barrels of commercial storage space is coming online by the end of next year that can be filled, she said. That means that while reserve buying may slow, it won't fall significantly. The Chinese seem to embrace the concept of asymmetric information which holds that those in possession of proprietary information and data hold a critical, strategic advantage over the less-informed. "Even if SPR tanks only come online later in the year, more commercial tanks are starting up," Meidan said. Energy Aspects sees demand for the reserves dropping by only 100,000 barrels a day in the second half of the year to 300,000 barrels daily. China's oil imports have averaged an unprecedented 7.5 million barrels a day so far this year, government data show. The purchases, along with temporary production outages in Nigeria and Canada, helped rebalance supply and demand in the market, leading Brent crude, the benchmark for more than half the world's oil, to jump almost 90 percent from mid-January to June. In the US, supplies in the strategic reserve were at 695 million as of August 26, enough to support 149 days of import protection, according to data from the Energy Department. The government regularly reports how much oil is at each of its four sites and even breaks down the quantity of crude that's held by sulphur level. When it purchased supplies for the reserve last year, it did so in a bidding system in which the sellers and even the price were publicly announced. China plans to build emergency reserves equivalent to 100 days of net imports by 2020, the nation's top refiner said in 2009, citing a plan approved by the State Council. It pushed back completion of the stockpile to beyond the 2020 deadline, according to a Five Year Plan released in March 2016. "The Chinese seem to embrace the concept of asymmetric information which holds that those in possession of proprietary information and data hold a critical, strategic advantage over the less-informed," JTD Energy's Driscoll said.
