Nigerian banks are safe and stable, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Director, Banking Supervision, Mrs. Tokunbo Martins, stated at the 329th meeting of the Bankers’ Committee held last week in Lagos. The apex bank’s assurance came despite unfavourable performances of top global lenders. Earnings by three of the world’s biggest banks- Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo – declined during the third quarter, ended September. Mrs. Martins assured customers that Nigeria’s financial sector is safe and sound, although she admitted that the nation’s banks are facing economic challenges. She said the lenders have strong capital buffers to weather the crisis. She dismissed reports published by Arqaam Capital, a foreign Investment and Research firm based in UAE insisting that some Nigerian banks are in crisis.  “Yes there was discussion around the stability of the banking sector. But even without the discussion, as Director Banking Supervision of the Central Bank of Nigeria, I can tell you that the report is false,” Mrs Martins said, adding, “ the banks are adequately capitalized, so the report is not true. That does not mean that the banking sector is not feeling the economic headwinds. The headwinds are also in every other jurisdictions. It is not strange. So, non-performing loans at 11.7 per cent is not what we should focus on”. She assured that Nigerian banks have the capacity to absorb whatever losses that  may arise from the level of non-performing loans in the industry. “But the fact is, do the banks have the capacity to absorb any further loses that would arise? The answer is that they do. They have very strong capital buffers. Another thing that is important is, do the banks have the capacity to generate huge income to absorb those loses? “Yes they do,”she said. “The underlying assets of the banks are still there and they are good. So, I think you should totally dispel or ignore that type of story. It should be expected to have Non-Performing Loans (NPLs). It is not the reason why any jurisdiction should be demonised. There are other jurisdictions that have NPLs as high as 15 per cent, 35 per cent and so on,” she argued.   Global banks’ earnings decline Citigroup’s net income fell 9.5 per cent to $3.8 billion, from $4.2 billion the same quarter a year ago. Revenues were also down 3.8 per cent to $17.8 billion during the July-September period, from $18.5 billion the same period last year. After the release of the results, shares of Citigroup fell 2.4 percent to $48.39 after opening Friday at $48.60 on the US stock market. At JP Morgan Chase, net income fell 7.3 per cent to $6.3 billion. That’s was down from $6.8 billion. Revenues, however, rose 8.5 percent to $25.5 billion after posting $23.5 billion in the third quarter of 2015. Shares of the bank fell 2.2 percent to $67.30 after they began the day at $68.80. Stirred with illegal banking activities, Wells Fargo’s earnings were highly anticipated. The bank said Friday its net income fell 3.4 percent to $5.6 billion in third quarter of 2016, from $5.8 billion during the same period a year ago. Revenues were up 1.8 percent to $22.3 billion from $21.9 billion. After opening at $45.17, shares of Wells Fargo fell 1.8 percent to $44.33. “I am deeply committed to restoring the trust of all of our stakeholders, including our customers, shareholders, and community partners,” new President and CEO Tim Sloan said in a statement. “We know that it will take time and a lot of hard work to earn back our reputation.” The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a $185 million fine for the illegal banking practices at Wells Fargo that dated to 2011, after employees opened millions of accounts and applied for half a million credit card accounts that were not authorised by consumers, in order to boost sales figures and meet sales targets. Wells Fargo fired 5,300 of its employees involved in the scandal. Then-CEO John Stumpf agreed last month to forfeit his equity awards valued at $41 million and retired Wednesday from the company. Wells Fargo & Co’s profit dropped for the fourth straight quarter as it set aside funds for potential legal costs from a bogus account scandal that cost former Chief Executive and Chairman John Stumpf his job. The bank still posted net income that topped analyst estimates, helped in part by lower-than-expected loan-loss provisions. Revenue rose two per cent to $22.33 bilion in the third quarter ended September 30, while non-interest income fell 0.4 per cent to $10.37bn. Net income applicable to shareholders fell 3.7 per cent to $5.24bn, or $1.03 per share, from $5.44bn, or $1.05 per share, a year earlier.   Stakeholders speak Former Executive Director, Keystone Bank, Richard Obire, said the decline in earnings of some leading global banks should not affect Nigerian banks because many of those lenders had already cut their dollar credit commitments to Nigeria due to the ongoing forex crisis. He said: “I do not see a strong link between these banks and the local banks and with the rise in crude oil prices, and continuous backing of the CBN, Nigerian banks will rise above the storm,” he said. He said that local banks have to shore up their capital positions to continue to surmount whatever economic-induced challenges that confront the banks. Oils sector analysts, Michael Stephens, said that Brent crude, the international oil price benchmark, initially dropped by 1.3 per cent to a little above $51 a barrel, while US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) dipped back below $50. The oil price recovery from below $43 per barrel a month ago, he said, represents positive dimensions to oil dependent economies including Nigeria. But other analysts expect oil to remain in a relatively narrow, if volatile, range until the next OPEC meeting in November and are buying and selling on any significant price movements higher or lower. Oil’s major producers and traders are betting that market optimism over a supply deal being agreed next month will prove to be misplaced. Investors have pushed the oil price above $50 in the past two weeks, but Reuters says “the people who produce, refine, ship or trade the real stuff on a daily basis” are putting their money on the rally continuing.   Health of the banks The CBN has also reiterated that no bank in the country is in distress, just as it reassured bank customers that their deposits are safe. The acting Director, Corporate Communications, CBN, Mr. Isaac Okorafor, said the attention of the central bank was drawn to the malicious rumours and unfounded speculations that some banks might have gone or be going into distress. He condemned the report as been totally false, saying, “in the strongest terms that these rumours and speculations are untrue and do not reflect the actual health of the individual banks and, indeed, the entire banking industry.” It, however, pointed out that no bank in the industry is in distress. “Therefore, the CBN would like to request the public to ignore speculations or rumours to the contrary as they could only be the handiwork of mischief makers who do not mean well for the Nigerian banking system and its economy. As the regulator of the industry, the CBN hereby reassures the banking and general public that their deposits remain safe in any Nigerian bank. There is therefore no need for panic withdrawals from any bank. “Going by both the CBN’s Examination Reports as well as analysis from market watchers, International Credit Rating Agencies, and Development Finance Institutions, the Nigerian banking industry remains strong in spite of the global economic challenges emanating from the collapse of global commodity prices. We therefore urge the banking public to remain calm and go about their normal businesses without panic. It is important that we do not create problems when none exists,” it added. Therefore, there is need for the central bank to take urgent step to arrest harmful marketing strategy because of its likely negative consequence on the industry. “The CBN wishes to state, and emphatically so, that it has not liquidated Skye Bank or any other deposit money bank for that matter. The bank also wishes to reiterate its earlier assurance that Skye Bank is not in distress and remains a healthy bank in the Nigerian banking system. Indeed, the health of the Nigerian banking system remains strong, all banks in Nigeria are safe and depositors have no cause to fear over their deposits,” further statement from the apex bank said.   Banks boost non-oil export CBN Director, Research and Development, Dr. Uwatt Uwatt said banks remain engine block of the economy and is doing everything possible to boost economic recovery. Speaking at the seminar for finance correspondents in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, he said there is need to reduce the cost of loan-able funds to non-oil exporters as such would raise production volumes and boost the country’s foreign exchange earnings. He explained that to check this trend, the apex bank canvassed for improved cheaper credits to everyone on the agric-value chain and also introduced the NIRAL scheme to de-risk agric lending. He also said the N200 billion Commercial Agricultural Credit Scheme and N220 billion Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) were also instituted to enable small businesses access cheap funds. Uwatt who spoke on the theme: ‘Overview of non-oil sector in Nigeria’, said the drop in prices of crude oil in international markets has rekindled the need to revamp the non-oil sector. “Declines in global crude oil prices have triggered major headwinds for the economy. Continued dependence on oil poses a big threat to economic stability. The nation is now trying to retrace its steps from over dependence on oil for major part of its revenues,” he said.

 Chase is more than doubling its commitment to small businesses Andrew Meola Oct. 18, 2016, 4:34 PM 852 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also THE PAYMENTS INDUSTRY EXPLAINED: The Trends Creating New Winners And Losers In The Card-Processing Ecosystem Credit cards are going the way of fax machines THE MOBILE PAYMENTS REPORT: Market forecasts, consumer trends, and the barriers and benefits that will influence adoption JPMorgan Chase is more than doubling its Small Business Forward program with a $75 million commitment over the next three years, the bank announced Monday. The money will support small businesses owned by women, minorities, and veterans. The $75 million includes a $1.9 million grant to the Association for Enterprise Opportunity (AEO), which links small business owners with alternative funding when they cannot qualify for standard loans. “Recent research from ICIC shows small businesses are more likely to hire from distressed neighborhoods where unemployment is high, reinforcing that small businesses are critical for employment,” said Janis Bowdler, Head of Small Business Initiatives, Global Philanthropy, JPMorgan Chase. “Increasing access to capital to underrepresented small businesses is vital to economic growth and the communities they serve. Small Business Forward will support a wide, diverse base of entrepreneurs so that economic growth is shared by all.”   On top of this, Chase has also extended its collaboration with nonprofit lender LiftFund with a $4.6 million grant for its new LiftUP Initiative, create more opportunities for diverse small businesses in Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio, New Orleans and Atlanta. This grant will provide quicker and less expensive loans to small business owners through an online program, with the goal of shortening loan approval time from an average of five weeks to just four days. Small businesses represent 99% of US companies, 54% of total sales, and 55% of all jobs, according to the US Small Business Administration. These businesses need capital in order to grow, but small businesses are underfunded — only half of small businesses with $100,000 to $1 million of annual revenue received at least some of the financing they applied for from large banks in late 2015. This is partially because banks have retreated from this segment because issuing loans to small businesses using the traditional underwriting model is expensive. This leaves a massive amount of unfulfilled loans that we estimate reached $96.5 billion in Q4 2015. Alternative lending companies have stepped in to capitalize on the opportunity available in helping meet more small business' lending needs.Alternative small business lending platforms use machine learning and digital tools to extend credit to a wide array of small businesses quickly and efficiently, particularly to those that have been rejected by banks. Alternative small business lending companies provide digital platforms that connect small business borrowers to capital using nontraditional means. We estimate that alternative small business lenders originated $5 billion and had a 4.3% share of the small business lending market in the US in 2015. But alternative small business lending platforms will originate $52 billion and gain a 20.7% share of the total market by 2020, driven by the continued growth of new players, increased borrower awareness and interest, and most importantly, major partnerships with big banks. Evan Bakker, research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on small business alternative lending that analyzes the market opportunity for alternative lenders, forecasts the market share and volume growth of alternative lending platforms, profiles key players, and addresses the main industry risks. Here are some key takeaways from the report: Alternative lending platforms are in a position to capitalize on this underfunding and also take share from banks. These companies use machine learning and digital tools to extend credit to a wide array of small businesses quickly and efficiently. We estimate that alternative lending companies' share of the small business lending market in the US will reach 20.7% by 2020. Alternative lenders are now partnering with banks and this will propel growth going forward. New lenders are finding opportunities to offer white-label services to major banks. We expect banking partnerships, like the one between JPMorgan and OnDeck, to add 7.7 percentage points to the alternative lending industry's market share by 2020. A flurry of new lenders have entered the market, but it's still early innings. A handful of small business lenders, from Funding Circle to Credibly, have entered the market and this is creating challenges as customer acquisition costs rise and alternative lending companies struggle to differentiate themselves. In full, the report: Forecasts the market share and volume growth of the small business alternative lending sector, and breaks down the main growth drivers. Explains why small businesses are underfunded, and quantifies the market opportunity for alternative lenders. Defines the different types of platforms that alternative lenders employ, including their revenue models.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Wed, Oct 19, 2016 - Page 12　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Mutual-fund balance declines as foreign funds exit By Crystal Hsu  /  Staff reporter Taiwan’s mutual-fund balance dropped 4.91 percent last month, as some foreign funds moved out of the local market amid growing global uncertainty, JPMorgan Asset Management Ltd said. Mutual funds dropped by NT$112 billion (US$3.54 billion) to NT$2.17 trillion, falling below the NT$2.2 trillion mark for the first time in six months, as global funds sought returns in other investment instruments, JPMorgan Taiwan said. The trend is fueling concern that foreign funds might flow to mature markets ahead of a potential interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve in December. “In the past, equity and multi-asset funds gain when currency funds decline, but fund managers prefer to stay on the sideline this time around until the uncertainty stabilizes,” JPMorgan Taiwan said. Currency funds stood at NT$860.1 billion last month, down 10.46 percent from one month earlier, the fund house said. Altogether, currency funds plunged 14.78 percent for the first nine months. Equity funds saw a 0.4 percent decline, while onshore and offshore fixed-income products retreated 4.89 percent and 1.82 percent respectively, it said. The light turnover in the local bourse reflected the waning investment interest. Mutual funds trimmed another NT$37.16 million worth of local shares yesterday after cutting their positions by NT$365.08 million last month, Taiwan Stock Exchange data showed. Net pullout accelerated to NT$2.05 billion this month, while foreign funds lowered their positions by NT$514.62 million, according to bourse statistics. This story has been viewed 994 times.

The Micex Index of 50 stocks added 0.5 percent to 1,967.10 by 6:15 p.m. in Moscow, having lost 2.2 percent in the previous four sessions. Bonds also rose, pushing yields on five-year local-currency OFZs down three basis points to 8.77 percent after rising to the highest in two months Monday on concern tensions with the U.S. over Syria may lead to new sanctions. The ruble strengthened 0.3 percent to 62.9475 per dollar. While OPEC’s decision to limit output for the first time in eight years last month turned the ruble into the world’s best-performing currency after Mexico’s peso, the benefits have yet to filter through to stocks. The Micex has fallen while oil has climbed 12 percent since the agreement on Sept. 28. “A potentially higher oil-price range is the catalyst for upgrading Russia,” JPMorgan analyst Adrian Mowat said in an e-mailed note, raising Russian stocks to overweight from neutral. “Valuations in Russia are cheap." Political Concern Russian shares on the Micex index are trading at 6.2 times estimated 12-month earnings, the lowest level among emerging markets, and half the valuation for MSCI Inc.’s emerging-market gauge. JPMorgan said that the energy sector stocks are pricing in $45-per-barrel oil, not $50. Brent crude retreated 0.3 percent to $51.39 a barrel on Tuesday. The dollar-denominated RTS Index is up 30 percent this year, the fourth-biggest gains among equity indexes worldwide. Germany on Monday joined the U.S. and Britain in weighing fresh sanctions against the Syrian and Russian governments over the bombardment of Aleppo, a development that could “pose some risks to OFZs,” according to Morgan Stanley. “We still see OFZs as an attractive carry trade in the medium term," analysts including Gordian Kemen said in an e-mailed note.

As the group chief security officer for Barclays, he has a squad of elite ex-government agents patrolling the company’s digital perimeter. He also has a hefty budget to acquire state-of-the-art technology to protect Britain’s second-biggest bank from cyber attacks. But Oerting, with no small dose of grudging admiration, says his adversaries excel at something that can’t be addressed with deep pockets or killer software: They’re superb networkers. “The organized crime groups in cyber are sharing much better than we are at the moment,” says Oerting, a Dane with a square jaw and the watchful eyes of a cop who’s investigated the underworld for 35 years. “They are sharing methodologies, knowledge, tools, practices—what works and what doesn’t.” Illustrator: Matt Chase Illustration: Matt Chase Now he and his counterparts at other big banks are doing some networking of their own. Oerting, who led the European Cybercrime Centre in The Hague before joining Barclays in 2015, has assigned some of his people to join allies from four other big U.K. banks at an operations center in London’s Canary Wharf complex. They sit side by side with police officers from the U.K. National Cyber Crime Unit. The idea is that this industry-government “fusion cell,” the Cyber Defense Alliance, will let the sleuths swap tips, techniques, and hunches the same way the bad guys do. “To do this right, you need to have trust,” Oerting says. “If I give information to another bank about my breaches, I don’t want to see this on the front page of the newspaper the next day.” The effort, the first of its kind in the U.K., mirrors a similar initiative in the U.S. called the National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance, a nonprofit in Pittsburgh that brings together academics, corporate security executives, intelligence operatives, and law enforcement officials. Barclays has also installed an analyst at Interpol’s cyber investigations unit in Singapore. Joining forces marks a big change for institutions long reluctant to share information about their IT systems, let alone how they’re compromised. They’ve decided they better reboot that mindset fast if they want to counter the online onslaught assailing their walls. In the second quarter of this year, cybercriminals tried to inject more than 1 million malware programs into financial companies worldwide, a 50 percent jump from the same period in 2015, according to Kaspersky Lab, a global cybersecurity company. Troels Oerting Photographer: Simon Dawson JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have all been cyberjacked in some way in the past couple of years. So has Swift, the cross-border payments messaging network that constitutes the global economy’s circulatory system. No surprise, then, that banks are throwing a lot of treasure at the problem. JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in September that he expected the bank’s $600 million annual outlay on IT security to soar to $1 billion in the next few years. Yet cyberthieves are getting wilier by the day. In so-called ­ man-in-the-middle attacks, they pretend to be trusted organizations to trick targets into sending them money or data. That happened in February when unidentified fraudsters sent fake Swift messages to the New York Fed, directing it to wire almost $1 billion from the accounts of Bangladesh’s central bank to accounts they controlled. The fraudsters got away with $81 million before the authorities caught on. As many as a dozen other lenders may have been similarly targeted. A rapidly escalating scheme is “ransomware,” where criminals use viruses to seize virtual control of a company’s computers and refuse to release them until they’re paid off, invariably in bitcoin. Then there are “whaling attacks.” By using sophisticated e-mails that pretend to be from a trusted friend or institution, frauds trick top corporate executives into divulging personal details. Thieves can then impersonate the execs and direct subordinates to transfer company funds to their own accounts. Even projects that bankers believe are top secret turn out to be far from it. A major U.S. lender recently learned that a supposedly unknown prototype for its new online portal had become a hot topic in a chat room used by criminals. Hackers were already testing malware on the site, says Alastair Paterson, the CEO and co-founder of Digital Shadows, the cyberdefense company that uncovered the scheme. Many of the instruments in such skulduggery are free or for sale on the web. Password-cracking programs with names such as Hashcat and Medusa have become staples of the digital toolkit. Thanks to bitcoin, it’s easy to buy more sophisticated penetration code and even ready-made hacks on the dark web, the subterranean layer of the internet untouched by conventional search engines. Cyber attacks are becoming even more spectacular. In September, Yahoo! disclosed that hackers had stolen the names, passwords, birth dates, and other personal data of more than 500 million users. Governments, organized crime gangs, and hacktivists have never been better equipped to damage a bank’s most valuable asset: its reputation. Financial companies are responding by dispatching their personnel to learn the dark arts of the digital world and share their knowledge with colleagues. On a recent morning, about a dozen men and women are tapping on computers in a training center near Cambridge, England, as part of an “ethical hacking” course taught by 7Safe, a British cybersecurity company. The pupils, a mix of corporate IT guys in jeans and polo shirts and hoodie-clad coders from a “white hat” collective called Hacker House, are working through a series of penetration tests on a fictional entity dubbed BeSureBank. One of the trainees, a young would-be cyberconsultant, is using a tool called Metasploit to expose BeSureBank’s IT specs in a process called enumeration. In minutes she’s scrolling through a catalog of the bank’s databases, ports, operating software, and, best of all, the usernames for all the accounts on the network. Next she starts cracking the passwords for those accounts by employing John the Ripper, an open source program that computes character combinations until it finds a match. Soon enough she’s logging in to the system with the administrator’s password. The consultant surveils another user’s keystrokes in real time and figures it could be a senior executive at BeSureBank accessing a sensitive database. “I’m sniffing the keystrokes,” she says to herself. “So that’s cool.” The lesson concludes when all the trainees launch a “payload,” or virus, into BeSureBank’s system and take it down in a simulated DDoS attack, or distributed denial of service. In the real world, this type of assault mobilizes networks of hijacked computers called botnets to overwhelm the target. Such operations are on the rise in finance. On the morning of Jan. 29, a payday for many employees, unidentified hackers launched a DDoS attack on HSBC’s U.K. site and took it offline for a few hours until the bank could repel the incursion. During a break in the class, a couple of corporate security directors grumble that their jobs aren’t getting any easier when so much data is flying out the door of their companies. It’s an important point. Every day employees at any number of companies take their work home with them on laptops, smartphones, and tablets. They log in to their banks’ networks from trains, conferences, airport lounges. So, too, do customers and myriad fintech startups that are increasingly augmenting banking services with innovative offerings of their own. In January 2018 a European Union law, Payment Services Directive 2, will require lenders to let outside companies access their customers’ accounts and connect their applications to the banks’ own systems. Banks, in other words, will start to look less like isolated fortresses and more like open-border platforms hosting numerous apps and services, like Google’s Android system. While digitization may be the future, it poses a major security migraine. “Every time there is a new app or a new channel opened, that provides criminal opportunities,” says Jamie Saunders, the director of the U.K. National Cyber Crime Unit. “Banks are taking enormous care to design security into their apps, but as the technology evolves, the criminal will evolve, too, and vulnerabilities will open up.” By then, Oerting plans to be drawing strength from his networking push and the next generation of cyberdefenses. He helps select and mentor promising startups in the accelerators that Barclays runs in Tel Aviv, London, and other cities. He’s championed Post-Quantum, a startup that recently went through the bank’s U.K. accelerator program. Post-Quantum’s military-grade encryption for instant messaging, which has been tested by NATO, is being eyed for deployment to top Barclays bankers. The company also protects digital documents by splitting the “master keys” needed to unlock files into pieces and distributing the code to different keepers. That way, “when a hacker comes in, there’s nothing to hack,” says Andersen Cheng, Post-Quantum’s CEO and the former chief operating officer of Carlyle Group’s European venture fund. For all the whiz-bang technology and talent at Oerting’s disposal, he’s still paranoid something terrible might happen now that we’ve entered the age of the spectacular attack; just look at how Russian hackers reportedly made off with e-mails from the Democratic National Committee during the U.S. presidential primaries. “My nightmare is to wake up one morning and realize we’ve lost data for millions of credit cards, or a huge amount of money, or in-boxes of e-mails for top executives,” Oerting says. “There is no such thing as absolute security.” At least by working together, the banks hope they’ll be in a better position to improve their odds.   —With assistance from Donal Griffin.   Robinson covers finance from London.     Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Joshua Lott/File Photo By Richa Naidu and Dan Freed Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported its first profit increase in three quarters on Monday, foiling expectations for another drop, as bond trading surged and expenses fell. Like rivals JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N), Bank of America enjoyed a boost from a resurgence in trading. That came as clients scrambled to reposition after Britain's surprise June vote to leave the European Union, and changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan's cost-cutting campaign also paid off as expenses fell in each of its four major business segments. On a pretax basis, quarterly profit was at its highest in a decade. Net income attributable to shareholders rose 6.6 percent to $4.45 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 41 cents, from 38 cents in the same period of 2015. Analysts, on average, had estimated a decline to 34 cents a share. Revenue grew 3 percent to $21.64 billion, beating the $20.97 billion expected by analysts. Net profit in Bank of America's trading-focused Global Markets arm jumped 34 percent from a year earlier as revenue from dealing fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities surged 39 percent. Equity trading revenue fell 17 percent. Last week, JPMorgan reported a 48 percent increase in bond trading and Citi posted a 35 percent gain. Trading in stocks rose 1 percent and fell 34 percent respectively at JPMorgan and Citi. Like Bank of America, JMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo beat third-quarter profit and revenue forecasts but their net earnings declined; JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) by 7.6 percent, Citigroup Inc's (C.N) by 10.5 percent and Wells Fargo & Co's (WFC.N) by 3.7 percent. Shares of Bank of America were little changed, up 0.15 percent in afternoon trading. Ahead of Monday, the stock had shed 4.9 percent since the start of the year, compared to a 2.5 percent decline in the KBW banking index .BKX. DUAL ROLES After scandal-ridden Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) separated its chief executive and chairman roles last week with the retirement of John Stumpf, Moynihan was asked during a conference call on Monday whether he expected renewed pressure to give up his dual role from regulators or shareholders. "Our lead independent director duty is as strong as anybody's in the industry," said Moynihan, who had faced down a shareholder vote last year over whether to split the roles. He added that he felt "comfortable" with the bank's current governance. Bank of America's large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities make it particularly dependent on a rise in interest rates to boost profits. To compensate for stubbornly low interest rates, Moynihan made trimming costs a top priority, saying in July he would cut annual expenses by another $5 billion by 2018, which would take the total to about $53 billion from about $58 billion in 2015. In the third quarter, non-interest expenses fell 3.3 percent to $13.48 billion as headcount fell by 3 percent. Like rivals, Bank of America got a boost from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more than $300 trillion worth of financial products worldwide. Libor moved to a seven-year high during the third quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings in short-term bank debt in advance of new regulations. Bank of America's net interest income rose 3 percent to $10.20 billion, the first increase in three quarters. Like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, BofA set aside more money to cover potential bad loans. The bank's provisions rose 5.5 percent to $850 million in the quarter. Income from investment banking rose 13.3 percent to $1.46 billion, driven by higher debt and equity issuance activity. Revenue for advising on deals tumbled 19 percent as companies held off making acquisitions amid political uncertainty in the United States and Brexit-related volatility in Britain. Adjusted revenue from Bank of America's wealth and investment management unit, which includes Merrill Lynch, fell 1.7 percent to $4.38 billion, but a 6 percent drop in non-interest expenses helped to boost net income by 10 percent. The wealth business, which has been a stable source of revenue growth when trading and investment banking revenues have fluctuated, is undergoing its own changes, with a new boss, longtime executive Andy Sieg, expected to take over in 2017 and amid a regulatory overhaul of financial advice in the United States.

Like rivals JPMorgan and Citigroup , Bank of America enjoyed a boost from a resurgence in trading. That came as clients scrambled to reposition after Britain's surprise June vote to leave the European Union, and changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan's cost-cutting campaign also paid off as expenses fell in each of its four major business segments. On a pretax basis, quarterly profit was at its highest in a decade. Net income attributable to shareholders rose 6.6 percent to $4.45 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 41 cents, from 38 cents in the same period of 2015. Analysts, on average, had estimated a decline to 34 cents a share. Revenue grew 3 percent to $21.64 billion, beating the $20.97 billion expected by analysts. Net profit in Bank of America's trading-focused Global Markets arm jumped 34 percent from a year earlier as revenue from dealing fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities surged 39 percent. Equity trading revenue fell 17 percent. Last week, JPMorgan reported a 48 percent increase in bond trading and Citi posted a 35 percent gain. Trading in stocks rose 1 percent and fell 34 percent respectively at JPMorgan and Citi. Like Bank of America, JMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo beat third-quarter profit and revenue forecasts but their net earnings declined; JPMorgan Chase & Co's by 7.6 percent, Citigroup Inc's by 10.5 percent and Wells Fargo & Co's by 3.7 percent. Shares of Bank of America were little changed, up 0.15 percent in afternoon trading. Ahead of Monday, the stock had shed 4.9 percent since the start of the year, compared to a 2.5 percent decline in the KBW banking index <.BKX>. DUAL ROLES After scandal-ridden Wells Fargo & Co separated its chief executive and chairman roles last week with the retirement of John Stumpf, Moynihan was asked during a conference call on Monday whether he expected renewed pressure to give up his dual role from regulators or shareholders. "Our lead independent director duty is as strong as anybody's in the industry," said Moynihan, who had faced down a shareholder vote last year over whether to split the roles. He added that he felt "comfortable" with the bank's current governance. Bank of America's large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities make it particularly dependent on a rise in interest rates to boost profits. To compensate for stubbornly low interest rates, Moynihan made trimming costs a top priority, saying in July he would cut annual expenses by another $5 billion by 2018, which would take the total to about $53 billion from about $58 billion in 2015. In the third quarter, non-interest expenses fell 3.3 percent to $13.48 billion as headcount fell by 3 percent. Like rivals, Bank of America got a boost from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more than $300 trillion worth of financial products worldwide. Libor moved to a seven-year high during the third quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings in short-term bank debt in advance of new regulations. Bank of America's net interest income rose 3 percent to $10.20 billion, the first increase in three quarters. Like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, BofA set aside more money to cover potential bad loans. The bank's provisions rose 5.5 percent to $850 million in the quarter. Income from investment banking rose 13.3 percent to $1.46 billion, driven by higher debt and equity issuance activity. Revenue for advising on deals tumbled 19 percent as companies held off making acquisitions amid political uncertainty in the United States and Brexit-related volatility in Britain. Adjusted revenue from Bank of America's wealth and investment management unit, which includes Merrill Lynch, fell 1.7 percent to $4.38 billion, but a 6 percent drop in non-interest expenses helped to boost net income by 10 percent. The wealth business, which has been a stable source of revenue growth when trading and investment banking revenues have fluctuated, is undergoing its own changes, with a new boss, longtime executive Andy Sieg, expected to take over in 2017 and amid a regulatory overhaul of financial advice in the United States.

After working off card balances he built up during college, Low started collecting new cards in May specifically to reap the increasingly lucrative travel awards banks are offering to encourage spending on their cards. In August, Low snagged a new Sapphire Reserve card, from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, which has become a magnet for millennials willing to pay the $450 annual fee for a sign-up bonus worth as much as $1,500 in travel, plus $300 in annual spending credits and more freebies. Low illustrates the problem. JPMorgan won't know if he will become a profitable customer for another year because the up-front rewards are so great. He may drop the Reserve card before the next annual fee. He has already acquired two more cards and now is spending on those to meet their requirements for more sign-up bonuses. And he doesn’t intend to borrow on his cards. That could be bad for JPMorgan because credit card companies historically have made about three-fourths of their revenue from interest. The rest has come from fees, which are being whittled away by the rising costs of the givebacks. Still, JPMorgan executives say they are thrilled that many more young people applied for the Reserve card than they ever expected. That's especially true with millennials - people who reached adulthood around 2000 - who are the next generation of depositors and borrowers. To make money from the card, JPMorgan has to have the right mix of customer spending, annual renewals and borrowing with repayments, said John Grund, a partner at card industry consulting firm First Annapolis. Marianne Lake, JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, declined to say how much card debt the bank needs customers to take on.

It’s finally paying off. Embed from Getty Images   Bloomberg News reports that Citigroup’s fixed-income revenue surged 35% to $3.47bn in the third quarter, and JPMorgan Chase posted $4.33bn from the business, $1bn more than analysts’ average estimates. Marianne Lake, JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, said Friday that the momentum continued into October. That would be a welcome change from the past seven years. Revenue from trading fixed-income products -- typically bonds, currencies and commodities -- tumbled to $70bn in 2015 at the world’s biggest investment banks, about half the 2009 level, according to data compiled by financial-research firm Coalition Ltd. U.S. banks have been counting on a rebound, as European rivals such as UBS retreated or cut deep to save money. Friday’s earnings reports may bode well for Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which report third-quarter results next week.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Matt Turner (mturner@businessinsider.com) Oct 17th 2016 11:11AM Banks are giving away credit cards at a rate. Bank of America Merrill Lynch just reported strong third-quarter earnings, and buried in the earnings release was this factoid: new US consumer credit card issuance hit the highest level since 2008. The bank issued 1.3 million credit cards during the three month period, with total credit card loans for the period averaging $88.2 billion in the US, with a further $9.7 billion outside the US. There was a similar story at Citigroup, where credit-card loans hit $147.8 billion, up 13% from a year ago. And at JPMorgan, there was a whopping 2.7 million new accounts opened during the third quarter, sending JPMorgan's credit card balance to $133.4 billion, up 5% from a year ago.

The boom in credit cards is something we've been tracking for a while at Business Insider. In August, the Liberty Street Economics blog at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published a study on recent developments in consumer credit card borrowing that highlighted booming new card issuance. The increase has been driven by those with lower credit scores, though these individuals were getting lower credit limits than in the past. "Although new cards are disproportionately issued to lower credit score borrowers, the overall extension of new credit, measured by increases in aggregate credit limits, continues to go overwhelmingly to those with credit scores above 720," the researchers wrote. The business case for growing credit card balances is clear. Bank of America said in its earnings release that the yield for US credit cards stood at 9.3% in the third quarter, making it a highly profitable business. Of course, you know, there's risks involved too.

REUTERS/Joshua Lott/File Photo By Richa Naidu and Dan Freed Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported its first profit increase in three quarters on Monday, foiling expectations for another drop, as bond trading surged and expenses fell. Like rivals JPMorgan (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N), Bank of America enjoyed a boost from a resurgence in trading. That came as clients scrambled to reposition after Britain's surprise June vote to leave the European Union, and changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan's cost-cutting campaign also paid off as expenses fell in each of its four major business segments. On a pretax basis, quarterly profit was at its highest in a decade. Net income attributable to shareholders rose 6.6 percent to $4.45 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 41 cents, from 38 cents in the same period of 2015. Analysts, on average, had estimated a decline to 34 cents a share. Revenue grew 3 percent to $21.64 billion, beating the $20.97 billion expected by analysts. Net profit in Bank of America's trading-focused Global Markets arm jumped 34 percent from a year earlier as revenue from dealing fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities surged 39 percent. Equity trading revenue fell 17 percent. Last week, JPMorgan reported a 48 percent increase in bond trading and Citi posted a 35 percent gain. Trading in stocks rose 1 percent and fell 34 percent respectively at JPMorgan and Citi. Like Bank of America, JMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo beat third-quarter profit and revenue forecasts but their net earnings declined; JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) by 7.6 percent, Citigroup Inc's (C.N) by 10.5 percent and Wells Fargo & Co's (WFC.N) by 3.7 percent. Shares of Bank of America were little changed, up 0.15 percent in afternoon trading. Ahead of Monday, the stock had shed 4.9 percent since the start of the year, compared to a 2.5 percent decline in the KBW banking index .BKX. DUAL ROLES After scandal-ridden Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) separated its chief executive and chairman roles last week with the retirement of John Stumpf, Moynihan was asked during a conference call on Monday whether he expected renewed pressure to give up his dual role from regulators or shareholders. "Our lead independent director duty is as strong as anybody's in the industry," said Moynihan, who had faced down a shareholder vote last year over whether to split the roles. He added that he felt "comfortable" with the bank's current governance. Bank of America's large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities make it particularly dependent on a rise in interest rates to boost profits. To compensate for stubbornly low interest rates, Moynihan made trimming costs a top priority, saying in July he would cut annual expenses by another $5 billion by 2018, which would take the total to about $53 billion from about $58 billion in 2015. In the third quarter, non-interest expenses fell 3.3 percent to $13.48 billion as headcount fell by 3 percent. Like rivals, Bank of America got a boost from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more than $300 trillion worth of financial products worldwide. Libor moved to a seven-year high during the third quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings in short-term bank debt in advance of new regulations. Bank of America's net interest income rose 3 percent to $10.20 billion, the first increase in three quarters. Like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, BofA set aside more money to cover potential bad loans. The bank's provisions rose 5.5 percent to $850 million in the quarter. Income from investment banking rose 13.3 percent to $1.46 billion, driven by higher debt and equity issuance activity. Revenue for advising on deals tumbled 19 percent as companies held off making acquisitions amid political uncertainty in the United States and Brexit-related volatility in Britain. Adjusted revenue from Bank of America's wealth and investment management unit, which includes Merrill Lynch, fell 1.7 percent to $4.38 billion, but a 6 percent drop in non-interest expenses helped to boost net income by 10 percent. The wealth business, which has been a stable source of revenue growth when trading and investment banking revenues have fluctuated, is undergoing its own changes, with a new boss, longtime executive Andy Sieg, expected to take over in 2017 and amid a regulatory overhaul of financial advice in the United States.

 Banks are giving away credit cards like it's 2008 Matt Turner Oct. 17, 2016, 10:15 AM 12,630 facebook linkedin twitter email print Scott Barbour / Getty Images Banks are giving away credit cards at a rate. Bank of America Merrill Lynch reported strong third-quarter earnings on Monday, and buried in the earnings release was this factoid: New US consumer credit card issuance hit the highest level since 2008. The bank issued 1.3 million credit cards during the three-month period, with total credit card loans for the period averaging $88.2 billion in the US and a further $9.7 billion outside the US. There was a similar story at Citigroup, where credit card loans hit $147.8 billion, up 13% from a year ago. And at JPMorgan, a whopping 2.7 million new accounts were opened during the third quarter, sending JPMorgan's credit card balance to $133.4 billion, up 5% from a year ago. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan CEO, even mentioned the bank's Sapphire Reserve, the credit card people have been going nuts for, in his earnings comments. The boom in credit cards is something we've been tracking for a while at Business Insider. In August, the Liberty Street Economics blog at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published a study on recent developments in consumer credit card borrowing that highlighted booming new card issuance. The increase has been driven by those with lower credit scores, though these people were getting historically lower credit limits.

All products or services are presented without warranty. Photo Credit: John Cumming/Getty Images The best rewards credit cards boast attractive cash back percentages, travel rewards, appealing sign-up bonuses and simple redemption models. Rewards credit cards can be divided into 2 general categories: travel and cash back cards. Some rewards cards offer a combo of those and points instead of straight cash back. The card that's best for you depends on your lifestyle and personal financial goals. Travel rewards cards typically offer perks and bonuses for spending on items such as airline purchases, dining, restaurants and hotels. <!-- iframe --> Cash back cards generally offer a percentage back for daily spending, cash back on specific categories and bonus cash for spending a specific amount within a certain time frame. In October 2016, CreditCards.com rounded up some of the best credit cards from its partners, including the best rewards credit cards. Here are the some of the best rewards credit cards, according to the October 2016 roundup from CreditCards.com: The best rewards credit cards Credit Card Variable APR Category Chase Freedom Unlimited 14.24% to 23.24% Top all-around rewards card Citi® Double Cash Credit Card 13.24% and 23.24% Top no annual fee rewards card Blue Cash Preferred® Card 13.24% and 23.24% Top cash-back rewards card Chase Sapphire Reserve 16.24% and 23.24% Top travel and airline rewards card Chase Sapphire Preferred® 16.24% to 23.24% Top points rewards card 1. Top all-around rewards credit card: Chase Freedom Unlimited CreditCards.com rated the Chase Freedom Unlimited credit card as one of the best for all-around rewards. With multiple redemption options, it offers unlimited 1.5% cash back on every purchase made. This card also boasts a $150 statement credit after spending $500 within 3 months of opening the account. Highlights: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card pays 1.5% cash back on every purchase. Chase Freedom Unlimited cardholders earn a solid $150 bonus statement credit for spending $500 purchases within the first 3 months of opening an account. This card allows you to redeem rewards for cash in any amount at any time. Those cash back rewards don't expire as long as the account is open. Chase Ultimate Rewards® points, worth 1 cent, can be transferred to other Chase cards that earn Chase Ultimate Rewards® points. Points can be redeemed for gift cards and trips booked through Chase. Fees and APR: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card has no annual fee. This card offers a 0% intro APR for 15 months on purchases and balance transfers. After the initial introductory period, the Chase Freedom Unlimited card offers a variable APR of 14.24% to 23.24%. There's a balance transfer fee of 5% of the amount transferred with a $5 minimum on the Chase Freedom Unlimited Card. Who should get this card: The Chase Freedom Unlimited is ideal for the consumer who wants a straightforward card for everyday purchases. Anyone looking for a wide range of redemption options will enjoy this card's versatility. The Chase Freedom Unlimited is especially useful for those who already hold other high-end Chase cards – like the Chase Sapphire Preferred or the Ink Plus Business Card -- since Chase Ultimate Rewards® can be transferred to other Chase cards. Disadvantages: While the Chase Freedom Unlimited has its perks – like unlimited rewards points – it has its limitations as well. Its cash-back rewards are middle of the road. The Chase Freedom Unlimited card's rate on cash back is good, but it's not the highest flat-rate available. The Citi® Double Dash Card offers 1% cash back on every dollar spent plus an additional 1% on every dollar that's paid off. There are no bonus categories. Perhaps the biggest downside to the Chase Freedom Unlimited is that it doesn't offer bonus categories. Those who spend frequently in one area may find that a card with bonus categories offers more value. Bottom line: The Chase Freedom Unlimited card is a solid all around choice as a flat-rate card for rewards on everyday spending. It might be best utilized alongside another Chase card or bonus category card that offers higher percentages on spending in specific categories. 2. Top no annual fee rewards card: Citi® Double Cash Credit Card The Citi® Double Cash Credit Card recently took 1st place in CreditCard.com's cash back credit card competition for its industry-leading cash back on everyday purchases. But it also made the site's October 2016 list as the top no annual fee credit card. It has a simple rewards structure with no categories to track, no caps on cash back and no annual fee. Highlights: The opportunity to earn generous rewards using the Citi® Double Cash credit card is what makes it stand out from the crowd. It offers 1% cash back on general purchases and an additional 1% when you pay your bill on time. There's no limit on what you can earn in cash back with this card. You can start redeeming for as little as $25. Redemption options include a statement credit, a gift card or a check. As a perk for some, the Citi® Double Cash credit card has no rotating categories requiring cardholders to remember to opt in and score rewards. The Citi® Double Cash card has no annual fee, making it cheaper than some competing cards, such as the Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express. Not only does the Citi® Double Cash offer generous cash back rewards, it has perks including purchase protection and trip cancellation protection. Citi® Double Cash cardholders can benefit from the Citi Price Rewind program. The company will automatically search for lower prices on items registered online and refund the difference on better deals. Fees and APR: There's no annual fee with the Citi® Double Cash credit card. This card comes with a 0% APR on balance transfers for 18 months. That makes it a good option for those interested in consolidating and paying down debt. This card comes with a variable APR between 13.24% and 23.24%. Who should get this card: The Citi® Double Cash credit card is best for those who would like a flat-rate, everyday cash back card with no limits on rewards and an easy-to-use rewards structure. Those looking for simplicity in a card will also find this card ideal. There's no chasing bonus categories, no rotating categories and no annual fee. Disadvantages: The opportunity to earn cash back twice and the simplicity of this card make it a very attractive option, but there are some drawbacks. Carrying a balance can eat up rewards with this card. Interest charges can add up quick on this card's 13.24% to 23.24% variable APR. You have to pay on time. In order to earn cash back twice, the card requires you to pay your bill on time each month. If you typically carry a balance, or often fail to pay on time, this may not be the card for you. There's no sign-up bonus. Sign-up bonuses are something you'll find on many competing cards, but not on the Citi® Double Cash. There are no bonus categories. This card certainly has a high rewards rate, but there's no opportunity to earn more for spending in certain categories. If you frequently spend big on a particular category – like groceries – you may want to consider another card. Bottom line: The Citi® Double Cash credit card is a great option for straight cash back rewards. It doesn't offer bonus categories, but it’s a great go-to card for earning rewards on daily purchases. Consider using this card alongside another card that offers more for where you spend the most. Compare Rewards Credit Cards 3. Top cash back card: Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express The Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express tied for 2nd place with the Chase Freedom Unlimited card in CreditCard.com's recent cash back card competition. It earns big kudos for very generous rewards on categories – 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets and 3% cash back on gas stations and select department stores. Highlights: The Blue Cash Preferred® is a top-notch card for high rewards rates on categories. It offers 6% cash back at U.S. supermarkets up to $6,000 per year. It also offers 3% cash back at U.S. gas stations and select department stores. On general purchases, this card pays 1%. For the 1st 6 months, the Blue Cash Preferred® card offers 5% cash back on eligible travel purchases up to $200. The Blue Cash Preferred® offers a $150 statement credit after spending $1,000 within the 1st 3 months of opening an account. Other perks with the Blue Cash Preferred® include a cash back tracker, purchase protection, return protection and roadside assistance. Fees: The Blue Cash Preferred® credit card has a variable APR between 13.24% and 23.24%, comparable to the other cards on this list. This card has a $95 annual fee, which is on the high side. But the generous rewards program, when used properly, can offset that fee. Who should get this card: The Blue Cash Preferred® credit card is best for those who spend big on groceries, gas and department stores. Those who already have a card for everyday spending might find this card as a nice supplement. Pair this card with an everyday flat-rate card to get more for your money where you spend the most. The 0% APR on purchases and balance transfers for 12 months make the Blue Cash Preferred® credit card a good option for anyone interested in financing a big purchase or consolidating and paying down debt. Disadvantages: The outstanding rewards on categories make the Blue Cash Preferred® credit card from American Express an attractive option, but it's not without its limitations. It has a spending cap. The $6,000 annual spending cap on groceries means the most you could earn is $360 at 6% before the relatively low 1% rate kicks in. It's not as widely accepted. American Express isn't as widely used as Visa, MasterCard and Discover. That might make it necessary to keep a backup card, or to use this card strategically with others. The $95 annual fee is higher than other cash-back cards. You'll need to make sure you spend often in this card's bonus categories to get the most value. Bottom line: The Blue Cash Preferred® Card from American Express can be used as an everyday card, but it really shines as a bonus category card. It might best be used alongside a card like the Citi® Double Cash or Chase Freedom Unlimited. CARD SEARCH: Compare the top rewards credit cards. 4. Top travel and airline credit card: Chase Sapphire Reserve The Chase Sapphire Reserve cards earns high ratings on CreditCards.com's best credit cards for October 2016 list for its travel and airline rewards.

Fees: The Chase Sapphire Reserve card has an annual fee of $450, similar to other cards in its class like the Citi Prestige® Card.

This card comes with a variable APR between 16.24% and 23.24%. Who should get this card: The Chase Sapphire Reserve card is best for the avid traveler who spends big on travel and dining and is fine with redeeming rewards through Chase Ultimate Rewards® program. Disadvantages: The Chase Sapphire Reserve offers big rewards to the frequent traveler, but it's not without its downsides. The card's hefty $450 annual fee can certainly eat into rewards if you're not spending heavily on travel and dining related expenses. You'll get the most benefit from this card by redeeming through the Chase Ultimate Rewards® program. If it's not a program you're fond of, it might be best to find another card. The bottom line Overall, the Chase Sapphire Reserve card is a solid choice for the frequent traveler. Its points program and bonus can more than make up for the somewhat hefty $450 annual fee. But you'll need to spend big in order to enjoy the benefits of this card. 5.

Cardholders can transfer points to one of Chase's partner airline or hotel loyalty programs at a 1:1 rate. There are no blackout dates or travel restrictions with this card.

Who should get this card: The Chase Sapphire Preferred® card is ideal for someone interested in an everyday, low-fee travel card with an outstanding sign-up bonus. Frequent travelers who are comfortable using the Chase Unlimited Rewards will find this card even more useful. When redeemed through the program, points are worth 25% more. Disadvantages: The generous points and sign-up bonus make the Chase Sapphire Preferred® a go-to for the frequent traveler, but it has a few disadvantages. Those who don't spend enough to earn the sign-up bonus or pay for the annual fee won't benefit much from this card. Travel options are somewhat limited with this card. You'll need to fly on one of Chase's travel partners – like United, Virgin Atlantic or Southwest – to get the most out of it. The bottom line: The Chase Sapphire Preferred® credit card is a great choice if you spend big on travel and dining at restaurants. It's also a good option if you typically use Chase's travel partners. But if you're not a big spender and need more flexible traveling options, it's wise to choose a different card.

Business Home LBoard Labuan-Sabah bridge will interest China, Japan, says economist Robin Augustin Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Bank of America profit rises on bond trading, cost cuts Reuters | October 17, 2016 Chief Executive Brian Moynihan's cost-cutting campaign also paid off as expenses fell in each of its four major business segments. NEW YORK: Bank of America Corp, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported its first profit increase in three quarters on Monday, foiling expectations for another drop, as bond trading surged and expenses fell. Like rivals JPMorgan and Citigroup Bank of America enjoyed a boost from a resurgence in trading. That came as clients scrambled to reposition after Britain’s surprise June vote to leave the European Union, and changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan’s cost-cutting campaign also paid off as expenses fell in each of its four major business segments. On a pretax basis, quarterly profit was at its highest in a decade. Net income attributable to shareholders rose 6.6 percent to $4.45 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 41 cents, from 38 cents in the same period of 2015. Analysts, on average, had estimated a decline to 34 cents a share. Revenue grew 3 percent to $21.64 billion, beating the $20.97 billion expected by analysts. Net profit in Bank of America’s trading-focused Global Markets arm jumped 34 percent from a year earlier as revenue from dealing fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities surged 39 percent. Equity trading revenue fell 17 percent. Last week, JPMorgan reported a 48 percent increase in bond trading and Citi posted a 35 percent gain. Like Bank of American, JMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo beat third-quarter profit and revenue forecasts but their net earnings declined; JPMorgan Chase & Co’s by 7.6 percent, Citigroup Inc’s by 10.5 percent and Wells Fargo & Co’s by 3.7 percent. Shares of Bank of America rose 1.07 percent in premarket trading. Its stock has fallen 4.9 percent since the start of the year, compared to a 2.5 percent decline in the KBW banking index .BKX. Costs Bank of America’s large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities makes it particularly dependent on a rise in interest rates to boost profits. To compensate for stubbornly low interest rates, Moynihan made trimming costs a top priority, saying in July he would cut annual expenses by another $5 billion by 2018, which would take the total to about $58 billion from about $53 billion in 2015. In the third quarter, non-interest expenses fell 3.3 percent to $13.48 billion. Like rivals, Bank of America got a boost from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more than $300 trillion worth of financial products worldwide. Libor moved to a seven-year high during the third quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings in short-term bank debt in advance of new regulations. Bank of America’s net interest income rose 3 percent to $10.20 billion, the first increase in three quarters. Like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, BofA set aside more money to cover potential bad loans. The bank’s provisions rose 5.5 percent to $850 million in the quarter. Income from investment banking rose 13.3 percent to $1.46 billion, driven by higher debt and equity issuance activity. Adjusted revenue from Bank of America’s wealth and investment management unit, which includes Merrill Lynch, fell 1.7 percent to $4.38 billion, but a 6 percent drop in non-interest expenses helped to boost net income by 10 percent. The wealth business has played a significant role in the bank’s strategy to grow revenue from more stable businesses that require relatively little capital.

Stocks slip as investors digest data, earnings; energy lags CNBC 10/17/2016 Fred Imbert © Provided by CNBC U.S. stocks traded slightly lower on Monday as investors digested a number of corporate results, key economic data while keeping an eye on the Federal Reserve. "I think the market needs to get assurance from Corporate America. They want to know that things are getting better," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "This is still a market that's trying to figure out whether it wants to break higher or lower." Quotes in the article International Business Machines Corp IBM ▲ 161.27 +1.05 +0.66% Hasbro Inc HAS ▲ 84.59 +0.69 +0.82% Netflix Inc NFLX ▼ 114.78 -0.64 -0.55% Charles Schwab Corp SCHW ▲ 36.08 +0.82 +2.33% The Dow Jones industrial average fell about 15 points, with McDonald's and Merck contributing the most losses. The S&P 500 slipped 0.1 percent, with energy leading decliners. U.S. crude fell more than 1 percent to $49.80 per barrel, weighed by a rising rig count in the United States. "A pullback unfolded last week, leading to a successful test of initial support near 2115 by the SPX. Short-term momentum has weakened, but oversold conditions are widespread enough to suggest that the pullback will mature this week," Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG, said in a Monday note. The Nasdaq fell 0.14 percent, as shares of Apple and the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) dropped 0.4 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively. At the open, the three major indexes hovered around the flatline. Banking giant Bank of America and toymaker Hasbro were among the firms reporting quarterly earnings before the bell. Both firms beat Wall Street estimates. IBM and Netflix are among the companies scheduled to release results after the close on Monday. Earnings season has gotten off to a good start. Of the 34 S&P 500 companies that had reported as of Friday morning, 79 percent had beaten Wall Street estimates for earnings per share, according to Nick Raich of The Earnings Scout. Last week, banking giants JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo all reported better-than-expected profits and sales. Investors also digested industrial production data, which showed a 0.1 percent increase in September, slightly below a consensus estimate of 0.2 percent. Meanwhile, the New York Fed's Empire State business conditions showed manufacturing in the state contracted for the third straight month. "Manufacturing production in the US has basically flat lined over the past two years and there are no signs that will change anytime soon to the upside," said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. Investors have been heavily scrutinizing U.S. economic data, as well as remarks from key Fed officials, gauging the likelihood the central bank raises rates before year's end. Later on Monday, Fed Vice Chair Stanley Fischer is scheduled to speak at the Economic Club of New York. A slew of economic data is scheduled for release later this week, including CPI, housing starts and the Beige Book. "I think the most important report this week will be the CPI report. I think it will show inflation further rising here," said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. He added the report would carry added weight after Fed Chair Janet Yellen's speech on Friday. Yellen said it's useful to consider the benefits of a "high-pressure economy," adding the post-financial crisis period has pushed policymakers into reconsidering the dynamics of inflation. Overseas, Chinese GDP, retail sales and industrial profits are all scheduled for release on Wednesday. Last week, U.S. stocks were weighed down by a surprise fall in Chinese exports. "It's pretty clear that China is bumping along the bottom. When we'll see a turnaround, that's unknown," said Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors. But "when you talk to companies that have boots on the ground, ... I think that's gives better color on the data." Ogg pointed specifically to Caterpillar, which is scheduled to report quarterly results next week. Elsewhere, U.S. Treasury yields slipped but remained close to recent highs, with the two-year note yield around 0.82 percent and the 10-year yield near 1.77 percent. The U.S. dollar fell slightly against a basket of currencies, with the euro steady below $1.10 and the yen just below 104. —CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

These are the three best MLP ETFs designed to track portfolios assembled by top index providers Alerian and Cushing Asset Management. Jordan Wathen (TMFValueMagnet) Oct 16, 2016 at 8:04PM Image source: Getty Images. Master limited partnerships (MLPs) offer sky-high dividend yields earned primarily from the transportation of oil and gas. Although they're simple to buy individually, investing in a diversified portfolio of MLPs in index funds can be tricky, as obscure tax and fund laws require fund sponsors to jump through hoops to design workable sector funds. These three MLP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) simplify tax complications and carry low expense ratios, making them the best MLP ETFs on the market today. MLP ETF Expense Ratio  Yield Alerian MLP ETF (NYSEMKT:AMLP) 0.85% 7.6% JPMorgan Alerian MLP ETN (NYSEMKT:AMJ) 0.85% 6.9% Credit Suisse X-Links Cushing 30 MLP Infrastructure ETN (NYSEMKT:MLPN) 0.85% 6.5% Data source: ETF and ETN sponsors. Here's why these exchange-traded products earn a top spot in diversified MLP investments. A true MLP ETF -- sort of The largest ETF in its industry, the Alerian MLP ETF is designed to simplify the process of investing in MLPs. This fund seeks to track the Alerian MLP Infrastructure Index, which tracks a portfolio of 25 MLPs that generate the majority of their cash flow from midstream activities in energy.  The Alerian MLP ETF is market-cap-weighted, so the largest MLPs make up substantially more of its portfolio than smaller MLPs. As a result, the three largest holdings -- Magellan Midstream Partners, Enterprise Products Partners, and Energy Transfer Partners -- make up more than 30% of the portfolio on a combined basis. The Alerian MLP ETF operates as a corporation rather than a true fund, and thus it pays corporate taxes on the distributions received on its MLP investments. Distributions from the ETF to its shareholders are then taxed again as dividend income. The upside to its structure is that investors who own it receive a simple 1099 from the company at tax time, and do not have to file Schedule K-1 that can cause a headache for investors who are not familiar with the extra tax responsibilities that come with MLP investing. This fund's biggest advantage is also its biggest disadvantage. Because the fund pays corporate taxes on distributions, it has lagged the performance of its index considerably. Over the five-year period ended Dec. 31, 2015, admittedly a poor period for the MLP industry as a whole, the fund generated average annual returns of 0.64% versus 3.01% for the underlying index, due to corporate taxation on MLP distributions and, to a lesser extent, fees charged to the fund. So, while this is an excellent fund for tracking the changes in MLP share prices, taxation on the fat dividends paid by MLPs leads it to underperform its index over time. The next two funds may be better-suited for investors who are interested in long-term return potential.  This ETN tracks the MLP index  Though it isn't an ETF by definition, the JPMorgan Alerian ETN offers investors the ability to invest in a product that tracks the performance of the MLP industry. It tracks the Alerian MLP Index, which includes 44 companies and weights them by market capitalization, seeking to invest in companies that make up 85% of the industry's collective market value. Exchange-traded notes do not invest in stocks that make up the underlying index like ETFs do. They are simply notes issued by an issuing bank (JPMorgan Chase, in this case) that are designed to track the value of an index. In effect, an ETN is a debt security issued by a bank that trades on the stock market. Its structure as a note is important for several reasons. First, an exchange-traded note is only as good as the credit of the issuing bank, but JPMorgan's status as a "too big to fail" institution is comforting to many investors. Second, because it is an ETN, all of its distributions are taxed as ordinary income because the ETN is a debt security and thus its "dividends" are actually interest. Finally, because it is an ETN, you'll receive a simple 1099 form at tax time, rather than the Schedule K-1 you would receive from individual MLPs. Though the underlying index is a very popular index for MLPs, investors should note that the index is market-cap-weighted and float-adjusted, resulting in an index where a handful of MLPs drive the majority of its performance. Its top three holdings -- Enterprise Products Partners, Magellan Midstream Partners, and Energy Transfer Partners -- combined make up just over 39% of the index. An MLP ETN with higher return potential Credit Suisse's premier MLP product is also an ETN, and thus it has all of the same tax and risk factors as the JPMorgan product. The primary difference is that this ETN is issued by Credit Suisse and tracks the Cushing 30 MLP Index, an equal-weighted index of 30 midstream MLPs. Stocks are picked for the index by a proprietary formula that selects companies based on fundamental metrics like cash flow generation. The real difference maker is how the underlying index works. The index weights all 30 stocks equally, and as a result the portfolio has significantly more small-cap exposure than other MLP ETFs and ETNs, as the index does not give preference to companies with larger market capitalizations. This ETN is inherently more volatile than other sector ETFs and ETNs. The chart below shows its price performance in comparison with those of the Alerian MLP ETF and JPMorgan Alerian MLP ETN over a recent five-year period. AMLP, AMJ, and MPN price change. Data by YCharts. When MLPs were red hot in 2014, Credit Suisse's MLP ETN rose faster than large-cap-dominated ETFs and ETNs. When investors turned cold on MLPs and the energy sector as a whole in 2015, it declined faster and to a greater degree than other ETFs and ETNs. This is typical of any investment with more small-cap exposure.  A current annualized yield of about 6.5% makes this the lowest-yielding MLP ETF or ETN on the list, primarily due to its focus on smaller companies. It is thus a better holding for the investor who wants to own MLPs for capital appreciation resulting from fluctuations in energy prices, increased drilling activity, or the resulting increased demand for energy transportation. Before you buy an MLP ETF or ETN There are a few things you should know before diving headfirst into MLPs for their high dividend yields. First, although Kinder Morgan is largely viewed as the bellwether for the MLP industry, it changed its structure to a C corporation in 2015, and thus it isn't included in many MLP ETFs and ETNs. That might be fine if you're a purist about corporate structure, but while Kinder Morgan isn't structured as an MLP, its core business is very much MLP-like. Investors who want to own the whole industry might want to buy Kinder Morgan on the side. Second, the tax benefits that MLP investors enjoy from buying MLP shares individually do not translate into ETFs or ETNs. When you own an MLP share directly, a portion of your distribution can be a return of capital, which reduces your cost basis and results in the deferral of taxes until you sell your shares of the MLP. Distributions from the Alerian MLP ETF are treated as dividends after a layer of corporate taxes, while income earned from shares of JPMorgan Alerian MLP ETN and Credit Suisse X-Links Cushing 30 MLP Infrastructure ETN are treated as ordinary interest income.  Put simply, MLP ETFs and ETNs negate many of the reasons why investors want to own MLPs in the first place. Investors who intend to hold MLPs for a long time would likely be better off owning a diversified portfolio of individual MLPs in a taxable account rather than an MLP ETF or ETN in a taxable or tax-deferred account like a 401(k) or IRA. Ultimately, it comes down to how much you're willing to pay for convenience. ETFs and ETNs make investing in MLPs much easier than investing in individual MLPs at the expense of some lost tax advantages. Jordan Wathen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

These are the three best MLP ETFs designed to track portfolios assembled by top index providers Alerian and Cushing Asset Management. Jordan Wathen (TMFValueMagnet) Oct 16, 2016 at 8:04PM Image source: Getty Images. Master limited partnerships (MLPs) offer sky-high dividend yields earned primarily from the transportation of oil and gas. Although they're simple to buy individually, investing in a diversified portfolio of MLPs in index funds can be tricky, as obscure tax and fund laws require fund sponsors to jump through hoops to design workable sector funds. These three MLP exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and exchange-traded notes (ETNs) simplify tax complications and carry low expense ratios, making them the best MLP ETFs on the market today. MLP ETF Expense Ratio  Yield Alerian MLP ETF (NYSEMKT:AMLP) 0.85% 7.6% JPMorgan Alerian MLP ETN (NYSEMKT:AMJ) 0.85% 6.9% Credit Suisse X-Links Cushing 30 MLP Infrastructure ETN (NYSEMKT:MLPN) 0.85% 6.5% Data source: ETF and ETN sponsors. Here's why these exchange-traded products earn a top spot in diversified MLP investments. A true MLP ETF -- sort of The largest ETF in its industry, the Alerian MLP ETF is designed to simplify the process of investing in MLPs. This fund seeks to track the Alerian MLP Infrastructure Index, which tracks a portfolio of 25 MLPs that generate the majority of their cash flow from midstream activities in energy.  The Alerian MLP ETF is market-cap-weighted, so the largest MLPs make up substantially more of its portfolio than smaller MLPs. As a result, the three largest holdings -- Magellan Midstream Partners, Enterprise Products Partners, and Energy Transfer Partners -- make up more than 30% of the portfolio on a combined basis. The Alerian MLP ETF operates as a corporation rather than a true fund, and thus it pays corporate taxes on the distributions received on its MLP investments. Distributions from the ETF to its shareholders are then taxed again as dividend income. The upside to its structure is that investors who own it receive a simple 1099 from the company at tax time, and do not have to file Schedule K-1 that can cause a headache for investors who are not familiar with the extra tax responsibilities that come with MLP investing. This fund's biggest advantage is also its biggest disadvantage. Because the fund pays corporate taxes on distributions, it has lagged the performance of its index considerably. Over the five-year period ended Dec. 31, 2015, admittedly a poor period for the MLP industry as a whole, the fund generated average annual returns of 0.64% versus 3.01% for the underlying index, due to corporate taxation on MLP distributions and, to a lesser extent, fees charged to the fund. So, while this is an excellent fund for tracking the changes in MLP share prices, taxation on the fat dividends paid by MLPs leads it to underperform its index over time. The next two funds may be better-suited for investors who are interested in long-term return potential.  This ETN tracks the MLP index  Though it isn't an ETF by definition, the JPMorgan Alerian ETN offers investors the ability to invest in a product that tracks the performance of the MLP industry. It tracks the Alerian MLP Index, which includes 44 companies and weights them by market capitalization, seeking to invest in companies that make up 85% of the industry's collective market value. Exchange-traded notes do not invest in stocks that make up the underlying index like ETFs do. They are simply notes issued by an issuing bank (JPMorgan Chase, in this case) that are designed to track the value of an index. In effect, an ETN is a debt security issued by a bank that trades on the stock market. Its structure as a note is important for several reasons. First, an exchange-traded note is only as good as the credit of the issuing bank, but JPMorgan's status as a "too big to fail" institution is comforting to many investors. Second, because it is an ETN, all of its distributions are taxed as ordinary income because the ETN is a debt security and thus its "dividends" are actually interest. Finally, because it is an ETN, you'll receive a simple 1099 form at tax time, rather than the Schedule K-1 you would receive from individual MLPs. Though the underlying index is a very popular index for MLPs, investors should note that the index is market-cap-weighted and float-adjusted, resulting in an index where a handful of MLPs drive the majority of its performance. Its top three holdings -- Enterprise Products Partners, Magellan Midstream Partners, and Energy Transfer Partners -- combined make up just over 39% of the index. An MLP ETN with higher return potential Credit Suisse's premier MLP product is also an ETN, and thus it has all of the same tax and risk factors as the JPMorgan product. The primary difference is that this ETN is issued by Credit Suisse and tracks the Cushing 30 MLP Index, an equal-weighted index of 30 midstream MLPs. Stocks are picked for the index by a proprietary formula that selects companies based on fundamental metrics like cash flow generation. The real difference maker is how the underlying index works. The index weights all 30 stocks equally, and as a result the portfolio has significantly more small-cap exposure than other MLP ETFs and ETNs, as the index does not give preference to companies with larger market capitalizations. This ETN is inherently more volatile than other sector ETFs and ETNs. The chart below shows its price performance in comparison with those of the Alerian MLP ETF and JPMorgan Alerian MLP ETN over a recent five-year period. AMLP, AMJ, and MPN price change. Data by YCharts. When MLPs were red hot in 2014, Credit Suisse's MLP ETN rose faster than large-cap-dominated ETFs and ETNs. When investors turned cold on MLPs and the energy sector as a whole in 2015, it declined faster and to a greater degree than other ETFs and ETNs. This is typical of any investment with more small-cap exposure.  A current annualized yield of about 6.5% makes this the lowest-yielding MLP ETF or ETN on the list, primarily due to its focus on smaller companies. It is thus a better holding for the investor who wants to own MLPs for capital appreciation resulting from fluctuations in energy prices, increased drilling activity, or the resulting increased demand for energy transportation. Before you buy an MLP ETF or ETN There are a few things you should know before diving headfirst into MLPs for their high dividend yields. First, although Kinder Morgan is largely viewed as the bellwether for the MLP industry, it changed its structure to a C corporation in 2015, and thus it isn't included in many MLP ETFs and ETNs. That might be fine if you're a purist about corporate structure, but while Kinder Morgan isn't structured as an MLP, its core business is very much MLP-like. Investors who want to own the whole industry might want to buy Kinder Morgan on the side. Second, the tax benefits that MLP investors enjoy from buying MLP shares individually do not translate into ETFs or ETNs. When you own an MLP share directly, a portion of your distribution can be a return of capital, which reduces your cost basis and results in the deferral of taxes until you sell your shares of the MLP. Distributions from the Alerian MLP ETF are treated as dividends after a layer of corporate taxes, while income earned from shares of JPMorgan Alerian MLP ETN and Credit Suisse X-Links Cushing 30 MLP Infrastructure ETN are treated as ordinary interest income.  Put simply, MLP ETFs and ETNs negate many of the reasons why investors want to own MLPs in the first place. Investors who intend to hold MLPs for a long time would likely be better off owning a diversified portfolio of individual MLPs in a taxable account rather than an MLP ETF or ETN in a taxable or tax-deferred account like a 401(k) or IRA. Ultimately, it comes down to how much you're willing to pay for convenience. ETFs and ETNs make investing in MLPs much easier than investing in individual MLPs at the expense of some lost tax advantages. Jordan Wathen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

From the perspective of their benchmark interest rates, they are looking increasingly similar. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 18, 2016 at 6:11PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. The United States has now experienced eight consecutive years where its primary short-term interest rate benchmark has been, for all intents and purposes, 0%. In this way, the American economy is starting to look more and more like that of Japan, which has seen short-term rates near the "zero-bound" for more than two decades. For investors in banks like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), this has significant implications, as all of those institutions will make much more money if and when rates eventually rise. Japan 2 Year Government Bond Interest Rate data by YCharts. Japan vs. United States To be clear, there's no question that the U.S. economy has stronger fundamentals than Japan's, which should give investors hope that rates here won't stay as low for as long. Most importantly, we have population growth, while Japan doesn't. Over the past five years, Japan's population has shrunk by 1 million, according to The Washington Post. That equates to somewhere around a negative 0.2% annual growth rate. By contrast, while there aren't enough babies born in the United States each year to offset deaths, the population is still growing thanks to positive net immigration. The latest data shows that the U.S. population is expanding at somewhere around 0.8% a year. On top of this, we've learned over the past decade that the United States is sitting on some of the greatest oil and natural gas reserves in the world. This is an enormous advantage, given that economic growth is literally and figuratively fueled by energy. Japan, by contrast, is the second-largest net importer of fossil fuels in the world, behind only China. This was one of the principal reasons, in fact, that Japan tried to expand its territorial empire so aggressively in the lead-up to World War II. Normalized interest rates But even though our economy is predicated on stronger fundamentals than Japan's, that doesn't mean that interest rates are bound to rise anytime soon. Sure, the Federal Reserve increased the fed funds rate by a token 0.25% last December, but it's since been reluctant to go further. Analysts and commentators in the financial community talk about this in the context of "normalized" interest rates. The underlying assumption is that rates will at some point return to historically "normal" levels given inflation expectations over a long period of time. But the problem with this assumption is that there's simply no such thing as a historically normal interest rate. One could even go so far as to argue that the most normal rates we've experienced since the mid-1950s are the ultra-low rates right now. As you can see in the chart below, this has been the only period in which the Fed Funds rate has held steady for a long stretch of time. Effective Federal Funds Rate data by YCharts. Anyone who invests in bank stocks needs to take note of this. The primary bull thesis right now underlying shares of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and others, is that they will make gobs more money once rates rise. And that's true: Bank of America says it'll earn around $7.5 billion more in pre-tax net interest income if rates increase by only 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point. JPMorgan Chase would earn $3 billion more under the same scenario. And while Wells Fargo doesn't disclose a precise dollar figure, it too would see its earnings go up by something like 2% if rates headed higher. The point here is that interest rates are the single most important catalyst for bank stocks, but we have no idea if or when they'll rise. You should accordingly approach the sector with humility.

Surprise: Banks have thrived in the post-Brexit world CNBC 10/18/2016 Evelyn Cheng Major banks have topped expectations so far this earnings season, helped primarily — and a bit ironically — by post-Brexit market volatility that spurred a surge in bond trading.  Quotes in the article SPDR® S&P Bank ETF KBE ▲ 38.94 +0.71 +1.86% Deutsche Bank AG DBK ▲ 15.03 +0.11 +0.76% Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS ▲ 203.94 +3.07 +1.53% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▲ 76.69 +0.04 +0.05% The surprise U.K. vote in June to leave the European Union was supposed to destabilize the financial system, but has had limited effect so far. It was more of an event for early summer, and the only evidence of the surprise vote right now is the drop in pound sterling, said Thierry Albert Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie. Benchmark global sovereign bond yields touched all-time lows in July and August after Brexit. Signals that central bank policy might be changing also contributed to the move in rates, and benchmark yields began recovering in the last several weeks. That's all to the benefit of fixed income and currency trading desks. "Anything that influences people to trade, buying or selling, that's better for broker-dealers," said Brandon Swensen, co-head of the fixed income desk at RBC Global Asset Management. "Volumes translate to revenues." As a result, a surge in fixed income trading revenue has been a consistent theme for the earnings and revenues beats from four major banks that have reported so far. "There's been a certain amount of volatility in interest rates (given) concern about the Fed in raising rates, reluctance of other central banks to continue with" quantitative easing, Macquarie's Wizman said. "Generally customers have sought to protect themselves from a back up in rates." Goldman Sachs (GS) said Tuesday that net revenues in fixed income, currency and commodities client execution rose 49 percent in the third quarter of this year from the same period in 2015, based on accounting including the debt valuation adjustment. That gain topped a 16 percent rise expected by KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl, and followed JPMorgan (JPM)'s 48 percent rise in fixed income markets revenue and a 35 percent jump for Citigroup (C), based on their earnings reports released last Friday. "Rates performance was particularly strong, with good client activity, as markets remained active throughout the quarter, post the Brexit vote and in anticipation of central bank actions as well as money market reform," JPMorgan said in its earnings press release. JPMorgan holds the largest global market share of fixed income and currency trading by revenue, according to analysis of rankings from 2013 to the first half of this year from Deutsche Bank Securities. Citigroup is second, followed by Deutsche Bank (DBK-DE), the data showed, while Goldman Sachs fell to sixth place in the first half of this year from fifth place last year. Bank of America (BAC) also said fixed income trading revenue jumped 32 percent year-over-year. Morgan Stanley is the only major bank left and is expected to report earnings Wednesday. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the firm to report earnings per share of 63 cents on revenue of $8.17 billion. Elevated activity in fixed income trading is expected to continue, especially on growing expectations of a Fed rate hike later this year and market talk of the European Central Bank winding down its asset purchase program known as quantitative easing. That potentially supports further gains in the fixed income trading business for the major banks. "We think whether it be in the U.S. elections or what's happening with central banks in Asia or Europe, there remain more volatility ahead," Swensen said. Analysts also pointed to benefits for fixed income desks from the resurgence in corporate debt issuance in the middle part of this year, after the risk-off sentiment last August and at the start of the year. That said, the third quarter rise in fixed income trading revenue "wasn't so much about tailwinds as it was not having so many headwinds for the quarter, and of course it translated nicely for us," Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said Tuesday on the bank's conference call. The bank stocks haven't responded significantly. Goldman Sachs shares were up 1.8 percent on the day as of early afternoon Tuesday trade, while the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) (KBE) was 1.4 percent lower over the last five trading days. "The market hasn't given banks credit for trading-related beats this quarter," KBW's Kleinhanzl said in a Tuesday note.

However, the Tuscan bank did not shut the door completely on a rival capital-strengthening blueprint submitted last week by veteran banker and former industry minister Corrado Passera. Monte dei Paschi, which emerged as the weakest lender in the latest round of Europe's stress tests this summer, needs to raise cash and get some 28 billion euros of bad loans off its balance sheet quickly to avert the risk of being wound down. The bank spurned Passera's first, 11th-hour approach in late July, opting instead for a salvage plan arranged by JP Morgan which had won preliminary approval from the European Central Bank. Since then however, the JPMorgan-led plan has stalled because of scant investor interest, and Passera has come back with a revised scheme which, according to sources close to the proposed deal, has the backing in principle of private equity funds including Warburg Pincus. Tuesday's board meeting, which was called to examine Passera's plan after he presented his new proposal to the bank on Oct. 13, lasted eight hours - an indication he may have been taken more seriously than in July. Passera was also asked by market regulator Consob to explain his plan on Tuesday. Passera's proposal involves a 2.5 billion euro capital increase reserved for private equity funds including Warburg Pincus and a 1 billion euro share sale to existing Monte dei Paschi investors. "It could be a wonderful plan if it goes like it should," Passera said on his way in to the Consob meeting. Monte dei Paschi shares were nearly 13 percent higher at the close of trading on expectations Passera's scheme would get some traction. In a statement after its board meeting, the bank confirmed its "firm" intention to press ahead with the JPMorgan deal and present a business and capital-boosting plan to the market on Oct. 24. However, it said that after that date, the board would proceed with an in-depth study of Passera's plan, already started by advisers. JPMorgan is now looking at a revised proposal which would involve Monte dei Paschi raising up to 2 billion euros via a debt-for-equity swap to be launched in November, according to people familiar with the matter. The bank would then launch a capital increase of up to 3 billion euros as early as Dec. 5, the day after a referendum on constitutional reform that could topple Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's government. However, sources say JPMorgan appears to have so far failed to find an anchor investor that would commit money to the capital increase. Detractors of Passera's plan in turn say his preliminary proposal is non-binding, does not name any of the private equity funds he claims are willing to invest, and is subject to due diligence. Some sources expect the two sides to eventually strike a compromise, but others say that is unlikely to happen given time constraints and personal rivalries.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Firms led by JPMorgan test blockchain-powered equity swaps post-trade By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss ReutersOctober 18, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Share By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK (Reuters) - Eight financial services companies led by JPMorgan Chase & Co and Barclays Bank Plc [BARCR.UL] have completed the test of an equity swaps post-trade transaction using blockchain technology and smart contracts, financial technology firm Axoni said in a statement on Tuesday. The blockchain-powered post-trade prototype was built by Axoni. The other participating institutions are Credit Suisse, Citigroup Inc, financial data and technology provides Thomson Reuters Corp and IHS Markit, as well as business consulting firm Capco. Thomson Reuters is the parent company of Reuters News. Blockchain technology powers the digital currency bitcoin and enables data-sharing across a network of individual computers. It has gained worldwide popularity because of its usefulness in recording and keeping track of assets across practically all industries. Smart contracts, on the other hand, are self-executing transaction agreements. Greg Schvey, Axoni chief executive, said the blockchain-enabled post-trade processing system could translate into substantial cost savings for the financial companies involved in the transaction. "The parties run a node that connects them with others on the network," he told Reuters in an interview Schvey said the current processing of equity swaps could be cumbersome and time-consuming, with each individual dealer having its own internal systems and a single trade going through several such systems. Given the complex nature of equity swaps, trades often break down because of the myriad layers of processing a transaction goes through before being completed, he added. "What happens now is that with this technology, the parties to the transaction, by virtue of the way blockchains work, are both co-processing and simultaneously running the same code, updating the state of that contracts over time, such that it removes the room for misalignment." The pilot project started in June. In early September, the participants conducted a diverse set of 133 structured test cases to assess the capabilities of blockchain technology for use with equity derivatives, Axoni said. "The proof of concept has shown that blockchain technology lends itself well to solving for the operational complexity and volumes of equity swaps lifecycle processing," said Roman Eisenberg, global head, prime services technology, at Credit Suisse. "This can possibly present an opportunity to not only save costs but also reduce operational risks while growing the client offering," he added.

The surprise U.K. vote in June to leave the European Union was supposed to destabilize the financial system, but has had limited effect so far. It was more of an event for early summer, and the only evidence of the surprise vote right now is the drop in the pound, said Thierry Albert Wizman, global interest rates and currencies strategist at Macquarie. Benchmark global sovereign bond yields touched all-time lows in July and August after the Brexit vote. Signals that central bank policy might be changing also contributed to the move in rates, and benchmark yields began recovering in the last several weeks. That's all to the benefit of fixed income and currency trading desks. "Anything that influences people to trade, buying or selling, that's better for broker-dealers," said Brandon Swensen, co-head of the fixed income desk at RBC Global Asset Management. "Volumes translate to revenues." show chapters <p>Banks beat, but why no rally?</p> <p>CNBC&#039;s Bob Pisani takes a closer look at bank earnings trends, and why banks have been selling off despite good news. The &ldquo;Fast Money&rdquo; traders weigh in.</p> Banks beat, but why no rally?    Monday, 17 Oct 2016 | 5:42 PM ET | 02:57 As a result, a surge in fixed income trading revenue has been a consistent theme for the earnings and revenue beats from four major banks that have reported so far. "There's been a certain amount of volatility in interest rates (given) concern about the Fed in raising rates, reluctance of other central banks to continue with" quantitative easing, Macquarie's Wizman said. "Generally customers have sought to protect themselves from a backup in rates." Goldman Sachs said Tuesday that net revenue in fixed income, currency and commodities client execution rose 49 percent in the third quarter of this year from the same period in 2015, based on accounting including the debt valuation adjustment. That gain topped a 16 percent rise expected by KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl, and followed JPMorgan's 48 percent surge in fixed income markets revenue and a 35 percent jump for Citigroup, based on their earnings reports released last Friday. "Rates performance was particularly strong, with good client activity, as markets remained active throughout the quarter, post the Brexit vote and in anticipation of central bank actions as well as money market reform," JPMorgan said in its earnings release. US 10-year Treasury yield year to date Source: Reuters JPMorgan holds the largest global market share of fixed income and currency trading by revenue, according to an analysis of rankings from 2013 to the first half of this year by Deutsche Bank Securities. Citigroup is second, followed by Deutsche Bank, the data showed, while Goldman Sachs fell to sixth place in the first half of this year from fifth place last year. Bank of America also said fixed income trading revenue jumped 32 percent year over year. Morgan Stanley is the only major bank left and is scheduled to report earnings Wednesday. Analysts polled by Reuters expect the company to post earnings per share of 63 cents on revenue of $8.17 billion. Elevated activity in fixed income trading is expected to continue, especially on growing expectations for a Fed rate hike later this year and market talk of the European Central Bank winding down its asset purchase program known as quantitative easing. That potentially supports further gains in the fixed income trading business for the major banks. "We think whether it be in the U.S. elections or what's happening with central banks in Asia or Europe, there remain more volatility ahead," Swensen said. Analysts also pointed to benefits for fixed income desks from the resurgence in corporate debt issuance in the middle part of this year, after the risk-off sentiment last August and at the start of the year. That said, the third-quarter rise in fixed income trading revenue "wasn't so much about tail winds as it was not having so many headwinds for the quarter, and of course it translated nicely for us," Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said Tuesday on the bank's conference call. The bank stocks haven't responded significantly. Goldman Sachs shares were up nearly 2 percent midafternoon Tuesday, while the SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE) was 1.4 percent lower over the last five trading days. "The market hasn't given banks credit for trading-related beats this quarter," KBW's Kleinhanzl said in a Tuesday note.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon offered a read-between-the-lines prediction that the next U.S. president will be Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. “I hope the next president, she reaches across the aisle,” Dimon, 60, said Monday at a conference sponsored by the New York-based bank, when asked what advice he’d give an incoming U.S. leader. The remark was met with loud applause. Partisan lawmakers haven’t been able to pass budgets or tackle issues including immigration and trade, he said. “We’re not acknowledging all these problems. We’re not getting that stuff done.” While Dimon’s comment was largely predictive, and stopped short of an endorsement, it makes him one of few heads of a large bank to publicly wade into the election. He prefaced the remark with a poke at Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has proposed “extreme vetting” of people entering the U.S. and vowed to build a wall along the border with Mexico, labeling some immigrants from that country “rapists.” “First of all, I want to say if you are Muslim, African American, an immigrant, a Mexican, you are completely welcome at JPMorgan Chase,” Dimon said. “Three of my grandparents immigrated from Greece, and you know, I don’t think any of them graduated high school to tell you the truth. How proud would they be to see their grandson run JPMorgan Chase." With three weeks to go before election day, Clinton is leading Trump by an average of 6.9 percentage points in national polls, according to RealClearPolitics. In 2008, Barack Obama won the presidency by 7.2 points, a margin that narrowed to 3.9 points when he was re-elected in 2012. Blankfein’s Reluctance Most Wall Street leaders have shied this year from indicating which candidate they want to see in the highest U.S. office. Such an endorsement risks backfiring at a time when the industry faces populist anger across the political spectrum. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein declined in February to take sides, saying his imprimatur could harm that person’s chances. “I don’t want to help or hurt anybody by giving them an endorsement,” he told CNBC. In the U.K., bankers were ineffective in persuading Britons to vote against leaving the European Union. A roster of financial industry leaders including Dimon backed then-Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in warning of economic fallout. The measure known as Brexit passed in June. During this year’s contentious U.S. campaign, Dimon has repeatedly emphasized the need for bipartisan collaboration. In 2012, he said he was still “barely” a Democrat and criticized the economic views of some politicians in Clinton’s party. Moelis’ Prediction Ken Moelis, the veteran dealmaker who runs his own investment bank, predicted in late September that Trump would win because voters are eager for a new approach. But that was before a 2005 video surfaced in which Trump bragged about being able to do anything to women because of his fame. Several women soon went public with accusations he sexually assaulted them. Trump has slid in polls while denying the allegations. There is a “desperate desire to change,” Moelis said of his prediction at the time. Still, he added, “either one of them can blow it.”   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is conducting a “deep dive” into its sales practices after rival Wells Fargo & Co. settled a probe into the opening of unauthorized accounts. While JPMorgan found some lapses, the problem wasn’t “systemic,” Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said Friday in a conference call with journalists, adding that the review is ongoing. “We will occasionally find issues,” she said. “The important thing is we are focused on finding them. We’re not seeing anything rising to the level where we would be concerned.” Banks are under increased pressure from lawmakers and customers to avoid abuses after Wells Fargo agreed to pay $185 million to resolve investigations into bogus accounts. Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf, who stepped down this week, had promoted the cross-selling of products, such as pitching credit cards to deposit account customers. Wells Fargo said it fired 5,300 employees over fake accounts, and Lake said that JPMorgan has already taken action in instances of staff misbehavior. ‘Right behaviors’ “We can’t have zero defects,” Lake said. “Our incentive compensation is designed for the right behaviors.” Wells Fargo is eliminating products sales goals for members of the retail banking team, and new CEO Tim Sloan said that he is “deeply committed” to restoring trust in the San Francisco-based company. Customer visits to branches declined about 4% in September, the month that the settlement was announced, compared with August, the lender said Friday in a presentation. There was a 30% reduction in the number of consumer checking accounts opened, and a decline in credit-card applications. Wells Fargo shares have lost 18% this year through Thursday. Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said rivals need to be sensitive to risk of employee abuses in an era of increased scrutiny. “When regulators start digging deep, they like to find things," Miller said in a Bloomberg Television interview Friday. “We’re very concerned that regulators really dig, coming after these banks too aggressively."

Alamoudi will be responsible for JPMorgan’s operations and strategy in the kingdom, the bank said in a statement Tuesday. He was previously CEO of JPMorgan Saudi Arabia Ltd., the local investment banking unit, and will report to Sjoerd Leenart, senior country officer for the Middle East, Turkey and Africa, and Khaled Hobballah, head of Middle East and North Africa markets. Al Deweesh will continue to act as head of investment banking for Saudi Arabia and report to Karim Tannir, Middle East and North Africa investment banking head. JPMorgan has had a role on some of the most high-profile deals in Saudi Arabia as the government seeks to build a $2 trillion sovereign-wealth fund and reshape the economy away from its reliance on oil sales. The bank advised the Public Investment Fund on its $3.5 billion investment in Uber Technologies Inc. in June and has an advisory role on the planned sale of shares in state oil company Saudi Aramco, people familiar with the matter said in April. The bank is also one of the global coordinators on the kingdom’s debut international bond sale, which is due to be completed this week. Even amid the slump in oil revenue there is a “huge opportunity here,” and JPMorgan planned to increase headcount in the kingdom by about 10 percent this year, Alamoudi said in an interview with Bloomberg in January. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Home Companies Goldman Sachs’ profit jumps 58 per cent as bond trading surges Goldman Sachs’ profit jumps 58 per cent as bond trading surges Goldman Sachs Group Inc reported a stronger-than-expected 57.9 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday as revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities surged. By: Reuters | Published: October 18, 2016 6:17 PM Net income applicable to shareholders jumped to .10 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from .33 billion a year earlier, while earnings per share rose to .88 from .90. (Reuters) Goldman Sachs Group Inc reported a stronger-than-expected 57.9 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday as revenue from trading bonds, currencies and commodities surged. Net income applicable to shareholders jumped to $2.10 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $1.33 billion a year earlier, while earnings per share rose to $4.88 from $2.90. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $3.82 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was the bank’s second straight rise in quarterly profit after four quarters of decline. Revenue from trading fixed-income securities, commodities and currencies increased 34 percent to $1.96 billion, helping to boost total net revenue by 19 percent to $8.17 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $7.42 billion. Goldman joins JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp in reporting stronger revenue from trading, which got a boost from Britain’s surprise vote to quit the European Union as well as from uncertainty about monetary policy in the United States and elsewhere. Goldman’s chief rival, Morgan Stanley, is due to report results on Wednesday, wrapping up what has been a better-than-expected reporting period for big U.S. banks. The bank’s annualized return on average common equity – a measure of how well a company uses shareholder money to generate profit – was 11.2 percent in the quarter and 8.7 percent for the first nine months of the year. Many investors think ROE should be at least 10 percent to cover the cost of capital. Goldman’s shares, which have fallen 6.2 percent this year, were up 1.37 percent at $171.32 in premarket trading. “We saw solid performance across the franchise that helped counter typical seasonal weakness,” Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said in a statement. Goldman, like other big banks, has been slashing costs and streamlining its businesses to help make up for sluggish revenue from trading and investment banking as well as to meet stricter capital requirements imposed after the financial crisis. Operating expenses in the latest quarter rose 10.07 percent to $5.3 billion, while compensation costs – the bank’s biggest expense – rose 36.4 percent to $3.21 billion. Goldman embarked on a cost-saving program earlier this year that it hopes will result in annual savings of $700 million. Overall trading revenue rose 16.7 percent to $3.75 billion. Investment banking revenue, which includes income from advising on mergers and acquisitions as well as underwriting bond and share offerings, fell 1.2 percent to $1.54 billion. Goldman Sachs topped all banks globally in M&A fees in the quarter, a slow one for deals, but trailed JPMorgan in revenue from underwriting bond and equity offerings, according to Thomson Reuters data. Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings fell to $46 million from $416 million. Please Wait while comments are loading...

At JP Morgan Chase, net income fell 7.3 percent to $ 6.3 billion.

Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon offered a read-between-the-lines prediction that the next US president will be Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. “I hope the next president, she reaches across the aisle,” Dimon, 60, said Monday at a conference sponsored by the New York-based bank, when asked what advice he’ll give the next US leader. The remark was met with loud applause. Lawmakers have struggled to pass budgets and haven’t tackled issues including immigration and trade, he said. “We’re not acknowledging all these problems. We’re not getting that stuff done.” Signs on a wall: Wall Street braces for Democratic win in US polls in November While Dimon’s comment was mainly predictive, and stopped short of a direct endorsement, it makes him one of the few senior Wall Street executives to weigh in publicly on the election. He also prefaced the remark with a poke at Republican nominee Donald Trump, who has proposed “extreme vetting” of people entering the US and vowed to build a wall along the border with Mexico, labelling some immigrants from that country “rapists.” “First of all, I want to say if you are Muslim, African American, an immigrant, a Mexican, you are completely welcome at JPMorgan Chase,” Dimon said. “Three of my grandparents immigrated from Greece, and you know, I don’t think any of them graduated high school to tell you the truth. How proud would they be to see their grandson run JPMorgan Chase.“ With three weeks to go before election day, Clinton is leading Trump by an average of 6.9 percentage points in national polls, according to RealClearPolitics. In 2008, Barack Obama won the presidency by 7.2 points, a margin that narrowed to 3.9 points when he was re-elected in 2012.   Most Popular Viewed 1 WikiLeaks' Assange vows to release ‘significant’ documents before US election 2 Hong Kong government has not been told if Beijing will intervene to ban pro-independence lawmakers 3 Launch of China’s most powerful rocket helps Beijing close gap with US 4 Obama caught in middle of unseemly spat over Clinton emails 5 In extraordinary move, Obama condemns FBI for Clinton email disclosure: ‘We don’t operate on innuendo’ Shared 1 Beijing ‘strongly dissatisfied’ after South Korean coastguard fires machine guns at Chinese trawlers 2 Decision on Hong Kong localist duo should be made by Legco, not court, lawyers argue in high-stakes hearing over oath saga 3 China Eastern pilot who avoided Shanghai runway collision rewarded with 3 million yuan 4 Hong Kong government has not been told if Beijing will intervene to ban pro-independence lawmakers 5 WikiLeaks' Assange vows to release ‘significant’ documents before US election Commented 1 Young professor blazes trail for Hong Kong scientists in mainland China as she shines light on puzzle that eluded Einstein 2 Foreign investment in China is ‘not a level playing field, but a one-way street’ 3 Launch of China’s most powerful rocket helps Beijing close gap with US 4 China’s 30-year long march to its biggest ever rocket launch 5 Terrified of ever being unconnected?

"I hope the next president, she reaches across the aisle," Dimon, said at a conference sponsored, according to Bloomberg. Clinton's main presidential competitor is Republican nominee Donald Trump — so unless the banking executive is predicting a victory for Green Party nominee Jill Stein (who is averaging low single digits in polls), then his use of the feminine pronoun indicates he is expecting the former Secretary of State will win the White House. Dimon's comment was met with "loud applause," Bloomberg reported. Clinton is averaging a multi-point lead in national polls: 6.9 percentage points in a four-way race, and 6.4 points head-to-head against Trump, according to RealClearPolitics. In May, Dimon told CNBC that the presidential candidates should stop their "denigration" and "finger-pointing," and get down to the business of uniting the nation. "If the next president does the right things around immigration, corporate and individual tax reform, [and] infrastructure spending, America would be booming," Dimon said at the time. "That boom would help the people who need it the most, the people at the bottom of the ladder."

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Oct 17, 2016 at 9:37AM Image source: Getty Images.  Concerns about a recession have been rippling through the market since the beginning of the year when the stock market entered a correction and oil prices were at rock-bottom levels. JPMorgan Chase predicted that there was a 67% chance of the U.S. hitting a recession by the end of 2017,  while the big banks generally agreed that 20% of the country was entering a recession, defined as two straight quarters of negative growth, this year. That didn't happen. Oil prices have recovered somewhat, and the S&P 500 is back near record highs. Strong job growth has continued -- with the country near full employment and the unemployment rate at 5%. Still, after seven years of expansion, cyclical forces are likely to send the economy into a recession at some point in the next few years -- the longest economic expansion in the modern era was the decade-long tech-boom in the 1990s. For investors looking to protect themselves from a potential recession, here are four stocks to consider. 1. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) The social networking leader may seem like an odd choice for a recession, but the company has as bulletproof a business model as any other and the job loss and downtime that come during a recession is only likely to promote the use of a service many already view as an easy diversion or a time waster. Of course, monthly average users are nice but that alone won't drive Facebook's business. The company needs to bring in advertising dollars, and while some businesses cut ad budgets during an advertising downturn, there is significant evidence that doing so damages a brand long term. Just as Facebook has a unique opportunity to add new users during a recession, so brands have a chance to increase market share and customer loyalty by maintaining their marketing budgets, especially with an essential service. Rival Alphabet was able to maintain positive revenue and earnings growth during the last recession. 2. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) A high-priced growth stock like Netflix may be the opposite of what's generally considered a defensive recession-proof stock, but there are a number of reasons why the leading video streamer could thrive during a recession. Like Facebook, the company offers an easy escape for those who may be struggling in the job market or have additional free time. Notably, movie theaters were some of the few businesses that boomed during the Great Depression as Americans sought escapist entertainment. Netflix has the ability to offer a similar benefit during a downturn, and it has a strong value proposition at a price of just $10 per month, compared to cable packages that now cost on average more than $100 a month. If tough times hit, it's easy to see how millions of Americans may decide to cut the cord and get a Netflix subscription instead. Furthermore, Netflix could see benefits on the cost side of the equation as prices for content could easily come down as competition among peers decreases and producers become more eager to make deals and bring in the extra income that comes with a streaming contract. All in all, Netflix could emerge as a big winner during a recession. During the last recession, the company continued to grow revenue and earnings at a fast pace, and the stock barely flinched. 3. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Wal-Mart is well regarded by the market as a strong stock to own during the recession. The retail giant has staked its reputation on Everyday Low Prices and is well known among consumers for its price competitiveness. The company tends to cater to a low- and middle-income population, but during a recession, its potential shopper base can swell as customers who might ordinarily spend their money somewhere else flock to Wal-Mart to save. As a Dividend Aristocrat that has raised its quarterly payout every year for 41 consecutive years, the company has upheld its commitment to increase shareholder returns. It now offers a dividend yield of 3%, making it the typical defensive stock that investors turn to during a recession. The stock also has a beta of just 0.1, meaning there's little correlation between its performance and the broader market's. The stock has also done well during the market pullbacks in the past. During the correction early this year, Wal-Mart was actually one of the few stocks that continued to gain as investors assumed it was a good bet during a potential downturn. Similarly, the retail giant weathered the 2008-2009 recession much better than the broader market. 4. Portfolio Recovery Associates (NASDAQ:PRAA) Looking for a stock that actually directly benefits from tough times? Look no further than Portfolio Recovery Associates.  The company specializes in debt collection -- its business acquires, collects, and processes unpaid accounts receivables. A recession can create an opportunity for PRA as more accounts go unpaid. During the last recession, it was able to collect 13% more consumer debt by targeting banks and using more aggressive tactics.  It can take several years for the company to collect unpaid debts, meaning that a recession doesn't immediately provide a boon to its business, but as it creates more uncollected accounts, the company can take advantage by growing its portfolio, which can fuel its collections over the coming years.  A recession can also make debt cheaper, giving the company an additional advantage as debt prices were estimated to fall 40% during the last recession, and PRA stock also recovered quickly. Following the stock's recent drop, a recession could be just the thing to help PRA bounce back. The son of PRA Group's CEO is currently employed by The Motley Fool.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 17, 2016 9:31am   Comments Share: Related HOG Technical Alert: Harley-Davidson Reaches Highest Level Since July 2015 Moats Are A Must; Get Them With This ETF Wunderlich’s Rommel Dionisio expects Harley-Davidson Inc (NYSE: HOG) to report “relatively sluggish” retail sales trends when the company reports it Q3 results. Dionisio maintains a Hold rating on the company with a price target of $52. Encouraging Checks The analyst mentioned, however, that “with a broad slate of new product innovations unveiled to dealers recently, including the first major engine redesign in 18 years, recent dealer feedback we have received from our most recent channel checks have been encouraging.” Dionisio expects Harley Davidson’s U.S. momentum to potentially improve over the next several months against the backdrop of a moderating competitive promotional environment. Related Link: Jefferies Initiates Coverage On Harley-Davidson At Hold The analyst stated that he could get more bullish on the stock if the company sees a rebound in its market share, along with improved industry sell-through trends. Sluggish Q3 Trends “With Harley's new model year 2017 (MY17) vehicles not arriving in dealerships until late Sept., HOG saw relatively sluggish retail sell-through trends in U.S. dealerships for most of the quarter, according to feedback from our proprietary channel checks,” Dionisio cautioned. The analyst noted that the heavyweight motorcycle industry has been generally lackluster for most of 2016, although Harley Davidson’s market share had remained mostly stable, with the easing of competitive promotional pressures, as compared to a year ago. New Product Cycle “Harley completely overhauled its important Touring line for MY17 by introducing a complete redesign of its classic V-Twin engine, called the Milwaukee Eight,” according to the Wunderlich report. This introduction represents the eight time that Harley Davidson has redesigned its VTwin motor in its 113-year history, and Dionisio believes this could possibly be the most significant powerplant launch since 1998.

Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Oct 17, 2016 at 9:37AM Image source: Getty Images.  Concerns about a recession have been rippling through the market since the beginning of the year when the stock market entered a correction and oil prices were at rock-bottom levels. JPMorgan Chase predicted that there was a 67% chance of the U.S. hitting a recession by the end of 2017,  while the big banks generally agreed that 20% of the country was entering a recession, defined as two straight quarters of negative growth, this year. That didn't happen. Oil prices have recovered somewhat, and the S&P 500 is back near record highs. Strong job growth has continued -- with the country near full employment and the unemployment rate at 5%. Still, after seven years of expansion, cyclical forces are likely to send the economy into a recession at some point in the next few years -- the longest economic expansion in the modern era was the decade-long tech-boom in the 1990s. For investors looking to protect themselves from a potential recession, here are four stocks to consider. 1. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) The social networking leader may seem like an odd choice for a recession, but the company has as bulletproof a business model as any other and the job loss and downtime that come during a recession is only likely to promote the use of a service many already view as an easy diversion or a time waster. Of course, monthly average users are nice but that alone won't drive Facebook's business. The company needs to bring in advertising dollars, and while some businesses cut ad budgets during an advertising downturn, there is significant evidence that doing so damages a brand long term. Just as Facebook has a unique opportunity to add new users during a recession, so brands have a chance to increase market share and customer loyalty by maintaining their marketing budgets, especially with an essential service. Rival Alphabet was able to maintain positive revenue and earnings growth during the last recession. 2. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) A high-priced growth stock like Netflix may be the opposite of what's generally considered a defensive recession-proof stock, but there are a number of reasons why the leading video streamer could thrive during a recession. Like Facebook, the company offers an easy escape for those who may be struggling in the job market or have additional free time. Notably, movie theaters were some of the few businesses that boomed during the Great Depression as Americans sought escapist entertainment. Netflix has the ability to offer a similar benefit during a downturn, and it has a strong value proposition at a price of just $10 per month, compared to cable packages that now cost on average more than $100 a month. If tough times hit, it's easy to see how millions of Americans may decide to cut the cord and get a Netflix subscription instead. Furthermore, Netflix could see benefits on the cost side of the equation as prices for content could easily come down as competition among peers decreases and producers become more eager to make deals and bring in the extra income that comes with a streaming contract. All in all, Netflix could emerge as a big winner during a recession. During the last recession, the company continued to grow revenue and earnings at a fast pace, and the stock barely flinched. 3. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Wal-Mart is well regarded by the market as a strong stock to own during the recession. The retail giant has staked its reputation on Everyday Low Prices and is well known among consumers for its price competitiveness. The company tends to cater to a low- and middle-income population, but during a recession, its potential shopper base can swell as customers who might ordinarily spend their money somewhere else flock to Wal-Mart to save. As a Dividend Aristocrat that has raised its quarterly payout every year for 41 consecutive years, the company has upheld its commitment to increase shareholder returns. It now offers a dividend yield of 3%, making it the typical defensive stock that investors turn to during a recession. The stock also has a beta of just 0.1, meaning there's little correlation between its performance and the broader market's. The stock has also done well during the market pullbacks in the past. During the correction early this year, Wal-Mart was actually one of the few stocks that continued to gain as investors assumed it was a good bet during a potential downturn. Similarly, the retail giant weathered the 2008-2009 recession much better than the broader market. 4. Portfolio Recovery Associates (NASDAQ:PRAA) Looking for a stock that actually directly benefits from tough times? Look no further than Portfolio Recovery Associates.  The company specializes in debt collection -- its business acquires, collects, and processes unpaid accounts receivables. A recession can create an opportunity for PRA as more accounts go unpaid. During the last recession, it was able to collect 13% more consumer debt by targeting banks and using more aggressive tactics.  It can take several years for the company to collect unpaid debts, meaning that a recession doesn't immediately provide a boon to its business, but as it creates more uncollected accounts, the company can take advantage by growing its portfolio, which can fuel its collections over the coming years.  A recession can also make debt cheaper, giving the company an additional advantage as debt prices were estimated to fall 40% during the last recession, and PRA stock also recovered quickly. Following the stock's recent drop, a recession could be just the thing to help PRA bounce back. The son of PRA Group's CEO is currently employed by The Motley Fool.

Politics Trump names Priebus and Bannon as top White House aides and says deportations will begin immediately Consumer Confidential With David Lazarus BUSINESS Consumer Confidential Newsletter California Inc.: DMV running down rules for robot vehicles Optimus Prime DreamWorks Autonomous vehicles may not be as sophisticated as Transformers, but they're here and the DMV wants to make sure there are rules to the road. Autonomous vehicles may not be as sophisticated as Transformers, but they're here and the DMV wants to make sure there are rules to the road. (DreamWorks) David Lazarus Welcome to California Inc., the weekly newsletter of the L.A. Times Business Section. I'm Business columnist David Lazarus, and here's a rundown of upcoming stories this week and the highlights of last week. It’s earnings season, so all eyes are on corporate balance sheets. Last week, big banks reported solid numbers, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo each posting profit and sales numbers that exceeded analyst expectations. However, Wells said its third-quarter profit slipped 3% from a year earlier as the company tries to recover from that bogus-accounts scandal. LOOKING AHEAD Checking out China: Wang Jianlin, chairman of China’s Dalian Wanda Group, will speak Monday night at LACMA on “Navigating Business in China.” Wanda is based in Beijing and owns AMC Entertainment, Legendary Entertainment and is trying to buy Dick Clark Productions. Some lawmakers have raised concerns about Wanda’s investments in Hollywood. VW deal: The proposed $15-billion settlement of Volkwagen’s emissions-cheating scandal will go before U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer for final approval on Tuesday. The settlement calls for Volkswagen to spend up to $10 billion buying back or repairing about 475,000 vehicles that were rigged to cheat on air pollution tests, and paying their owners an additional $5,100 to $10,000. It also includes more than $2.5 billion for unspecified environmental mitigation and an additional $2 billion to promote zero-emissions vehicles. Breyer gave the deal preliminary OK in July. Robot cars: How will driverless vehicles be regulated in California? On Wednesday, the Department of Motor Vehicles is hosting a public workshop in Sacramento to discuss rules for autonomous vehicles. The DMV is reviewing federal guidelines on driverless cars that were released last month and is planning to release draft California regulations in the coming weeks. Currently 15 companies — including Google, Honda, Tesla and Nissan — hold permits to test driverless vehicles in California. Airport expansion: On Thursday, the city of Long Beach will hold a public hearing to discuss allowing international flights in and out of Long Beach Airport. The hearing will focus on a just-released study by Jacobs Engineering that concluded new international flights could replace existing domestic flights at Long Beach Airport without exceeding current noise limits. Some Long Beach residents have opposed the plan for fear of increased noise. The hearing begins at 6:30 p.m. at the Long Beach Gas & Oil Auditorium, 2400 E. Spring St. Jobs data: The California employment report for September will be released Friday by the state Employment Development Department. The closely followed economic indicator brought good news last month, showing that the state added a net 63,100 jobs in August and the unemployment rate held steady at 5.5%. Economists say California is nearing full employment, which is when nearly everyone who wants a job has one. That means there are fewer people in the state to recruit into the labor market. THE AGENDA Monday’s Business section looks at the cost of living. When it comes to inflation, the price might not always be right, and that has consequences for the pocketbooks of individual Americans and the nation’s economic health. But calculating the inflation rate is complicated and doesn’t always reflect what many Americans experience when they open their wallets to make a variety of everyday purchases. “It’s inherently an imprecise thing,” says Laurence Ball, an inflation expert and head of the economics department at Johns Hopkins University. “Different people consume different baskets of goods, so my personal inflation rate and your personal inflation rate could be different.” STORY LINES Here are some of the other stories that ran in the Times Business section in recent days that we’re continuing to follow: Bank CEO resigns: John Stumpf resigned as chairman and chief executive of Wells Fargo & Co., bowing to mounting criticism from lawmakers and others who said he should lose his job over revelations that bank employees created as many as 2 million accounts without customers’ authorization. Stumpf, 63, had been chief executive since 2007 and chairman of Wells Fargo’s board since 2010. Timothy J. Sloan, 56, a longtime Wells Fargo executive who was named president of the company last year, will replace Stumpf as chief executive. Affordable housing: The city of Los Angeles has won nearly $65 million in state funding to develop six affordable housing projects amid a homelessness crisis. The money allows for 553 below-market units to be built, the office of L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti announced. Nearly 350 of those residences are for formerly homeless individuals and planned for projects with supportive services. The remaining are for low-income households, who are increasingly struggling to afford a home in one of the nation’s most expensive cities. Yahoo sale: Verizon’s deal to buy Yahoo for $4.83 billion could be on shaky ground after the Internet company disclosed last month a 2014 data breach that affected at least 500 million Yahoo accounts. The breach — one of the largest in the history of cyberattacks — included user data such as email addresses, dates of birth, encrypted passwords and security answers. Yahoo said in September that it was not aware of the cyberattack when it signed the deal with Verizon in July of this year. Republic of Samsung: South Koreans sometimes call their country the Republic of Samsung, and they’re only half-joking. Samsung accounts for 20% of the country’s gross domestic product, and its footprint is everywhere. So it is with some jitters that people in Samsung’s home country have watched the crisis surrounding the company’s Galaxy Note 7 smartphone. Beastly decision: One of the nation’s most popular travel booking sites is taking a stand on animal welfare by halting the sale of tickets to attractions that let tourists ride or touch wild or endangered animals. TripAdvisor announced plans to adopt the changes by early 2017, partly in response to pressure from animal rights groups to stop selling tickets to attractions that they feel exploit animals without offering any educational value. WHAT WE’RE READING And some recent stories from other publications that caught our eye: Hard feelings: Bloomberg tells the tale of L.A. residents who traded their front lawns for gravel landscaping. A company called Turf Terminators that specialized in such transitions is accused by some of creating eyesores. “My yard just looks worse than ever,” one says. Chat bots: The New York Times explores so-called conversation computing (think Siri) and the challenge of finding just the right voice. “Choosing a voice has implications for design, branding or interacting with machines. A voice can change or harden how we see each other.” A fitter Twitter? NPR asks if Twitter, now reportedly up for sale, would do best as a nonprofit. “In the second quarter it lost more than $100 million — so perhaps it already is a nonprofit.” Not so sweet: In yet another illustration of the insane U.S. drug market, the Wall Street Journal observes that insulin prices are soaring, not just because manufacturers are boosting list prices, but also because industry middle men “demand higher rebates in exchange for including the drug on their preferred-drug lists.” Tough gig: The New Yorker profiles Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump’s campaign manager and spokeswoman. “Running Donald Trump’s campaign is like being the drummer in Spinal Tap: Those who take the position tend to disappear in mysterious circumstances.” SPARE CHANGE To what was the New Yorker referring with that Spinal Tap reference? Why, to this, of course. As the band’s David St. Hubbins points out: “Dozens of people spontaneously combust each year. It’s just not widely reported.” For the latest money news, go to www.latimes.com/business. Until next time, I'll see you in the Business section. David Lazarus' column runs Tuesdays and Fridays.

Equities in the Middle East declined the most in the world as companies from Emirates NBD PJSC to Alinma Bank reported earnings that missed analysts’ forecasts. Chinese shares denominated in US dollars dropped the most in nine months on concern the yuan will depreciate further. Turkish bond yields headed for an almost three-month high and the lira weakened the most in emerging markets on speculation a rate cut expected Thursday may be bigger than previously forecast. JPMorgan Chase & Company downgraded emerging-market stocks to neutral from overweight, citing “an opportunity to book in some profits.” Investors’ appetite for risk has diminished with the futures market indicating a two-thirds probability of a US interest-rate hike in December and Republican candidate Donald Trump pledging to renegotiate trade deals if he wins the November 8 presidential elections. China’s third-quarter gross domestic product data will be closely watched on Wednesday after exports fell in September. “There is a bit of caution ahead of the last US presidential debate and concerns about how much growth is slowing in China,” said Per Hammarlund, the chief emerging-market strategist at SEB in Stockholm, who favours ruble bonds and the Brazilian real. “Investors are waiting for a new catalyst to restart the rally, which has stalled.” Trump will face Democrat Hillary Clinton in the third and final presidential debate on Wednesday, as part of an acrimonious campaign that has made investors nervous over America’s future relationship with the world, including deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index slid 0.6 percent to 892.05 at 11:37 a.m. in London, paring its gains this year to 12 percent. The currencies gauge fell 0.4 percent, trimming its 2016 rally to 5.3 percent. Yet most investors including JPMorgan point to improving outlook for emerging markets in the medium term. US exchange-traded funds that invest in developing nations witnessed inflows for a 20th successive week, adding $23.5 billion cumulatively. -With assistance from Liau Y-Sing and Choong En Han.

Reuters has not verified the newspaper reports, and cannot vouch for their accuracy. New items are marked with (*). For a complete list of diary events in Italy please click on . POLITICS Florence, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi attends meeting on the Italian language. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi announced his 2017 budget plan on Saturday, hoping to persuade the European Commission to approve its minimal reduction in the budget deficit next year while avoiding unpopular belt-tightening. La Repubblica newspaper said on Sunday without naming sources that the Commission warned it would not approve the budget if Renzi does not lower the deficit target. The paper said the Commission could also revoke flexibility it had allowed Italy in 2015-16. Industry Minister Carlo Calenda told Corriere della Sera on Sunday that Italy would not "arm wrestle" with Brussels over the budget. "As ever, there will be discussions about single measures and tenths of percentage points, but in the end the budget will pass," Calenda said. ECONOMY ISTAT releases August foreign trade data (0800 GMT). DEBT Treasury starts offer of new October 2024 'BTP Italia' inflation-linked bond reserved to retail investors; ends on Oct. 19 barring early closure. A referendum vote Italy will hold on Dec. 4 on the government's constitutional reform could easily feed market volatility, the head of public debt Maria Cannata said on Friday. (*) Cannata said the Treasury expects gross debt issuance to total around 375 billion euros this year. COMPANIES MONTE DEI PASCHI DI SIENA, The Italian bank on Friday gave a clean bill of health to its newly appointed chief executive, Marco Morelli, saying he met good repute criteria for his position. MPS said on Saturday it had received a non-binding proposal on Oct. 13 from former Industry Minister Corrado Passera, presenting an alternative plan to boost the lender's capital, and had given its CEO a mandate to analyse it further. The bank's board may discuss the proposals at a meeting on Tuesday, a source told Reuters. MPS has given a mandate to Lazard to discuss Passera's plan with his advisers, Il Sole 24 Ore reported on Sunday. Passera's ideas could be merged with a turnaround project arranged by JPMorgan already underway at the troubled bank if Passera can bring in investors to inject capital, Il Sole said, adding that the former minister could be appointed chairman of the bank if the two plans are merged. Il Messaggero said on Saturday the bank is in talks with Arab sovereign funds including that of Qatar to find an "anchor investor" that can help attract more investors to follow. A source told Reuters earlier this month talks with a sovereign wealth fund had fallen through. Bank of Italy Director General Salvatore Rossi rejected a suggestion that JPMorgan had a monopoly in Italy, telling an interviewer on SkyTG24 on Sunday, "I don't think so at all", and adding JPMorgan was an adviser to MPS. BANCA POPOLARE DI MILANO, BANCO POPOLARE , UBI BANCA Shareholders in both banks approved their merger on Saturday, giving the final green light to the creation of Italy's third-largest bank by assets. A majority of 99.5 percent of Banco Popolare shareholders and 71.8 percent of BPM shareholders backed the deal. Shares in the two lenders had rallied on Friday as investors bet shareholders would approve the merger, which is set to be the first prompted by reforms the government introduced early last year to promote tie-ups and boost bank profitability. Banco Popolare is working on the sale of a 650 million euro bad loan portfolio which it expects to close by the end of the year, its CEO said on Saturday. Bank of Italy Director General Salvatore Rossi told SkyTG24 on Sunday that the merger was "obviously positive", although many had expected the new law to prompt more such deals. BPM, POSTE ITALIANE, ANIMA HOLDING BPM said on Friday Poste had decided not to renew a shareholder pact over asset manager Anima after it expires on April 17, 2016. A source close to the matter said the decision stemmed from Poste's desire to strengthen its role over Anima in relation to possible transactions both in the short- and long-term. A consortium comprising Poste, Anima and state lender CDP is in the running for UniCredit's asset manager Pioneer. UNICREDIT, PZU BANK PEKAO Italy's biggest bank said on Saturday it was in talks with Polish insurer WZU and development fund Polski Fundusz Rozwoju about selling its Bank Pekao unit, but there was no certainty these would lead to a deal. Separately, state-run PZU said it had started negotiations with the Italian bank over buying Bank Pekao. (*) FIAT CHRYSLER AUTOMOBILES Canadian manufacturing workers at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles voted on Sunday to approve a tentative labour agreement with the automaker, their union said, averting a strike and clearing the way for talks with Ford Motor. Tougher European car emissions tests being introduced in the wake of the Volkswagen scandal are about to bring surprising consequences: bigger engines. LEONARDO-FINMECCANICA, AIRBUS Airbus is in "constructive talks" with Leonardo-Finmeccanica over possibly buying the Italian group's stake in European missiles maker MBDA, Il Sole 24 Ore quoted Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders saying on Saturday.

The producer of family fare like “Finding Dory” had gone so far as to hire two investment banks, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Guggenheim Partners LLC, to help evaluate a bid for Twitter. Disney management also listened to a presentation about the business from Twitter executives, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions were private. There were other reasons for Disney not to pursue Twitter. The social media pioneer, creator of the 140-character tweet, is losing money and yet sports a market value of almost $12 billion. That would be a big deal even for Disney, which has a market value 12 times that. Some of Disney’s largest investors called the company over the past few weeks to express their displeasure with a Twitter purchase for those reasons, people close to the companies said. Salesforce.com Inc. also decided against a Twitter bid, as did Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Another Milestone Twitter could have been another milestone in the career of Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger. The 65-year-old can point to the success of other acquisitions made under his tenure such as Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm. In a public chat at Boston College earlier this month Iger talked about how critical it is for Disney’s brands to establish a direct connection to consumers via mobile devices. Iger recruited Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey to the Disney board three years ago. Dorsey has said he respects Iger and considers him a mentor. Iger was invited to speak to Twitter’s senior staff about leadership at the beginning of the year. Dorsey has been resistant to selling the company, however, hoping instead for more time to prove that a new live-video streaming strategy can help increase user growth, people familiar with the matter have said. Twitter’s board decided to retain bankers to explore the option after receiving interest from a prospective bidder that has since backed out.

You will now receive the Game Plan newsletter Twitter has for years faced criticism for its hands-off approach to abuse and harassment on its service. Because people don’t have to use their real names, racist, sexist and anti-Semitic internet “trolls” have thrived on the platform. The company has pledged to become more serious about the issue in the last year, working on solutions such as letting people block keywords. Still, attacks this year have led to temporary departures of high-profile users including Leslie Jones, an actress in the movie “Ghostbusters,” as well as a New York Times journalist. Twitter has only recently started exploring technological solutions to harassment on its service.

Goldman Sachs's bond-trading engine revs up to beat estimates Tuesday , October 18, 2016 - 10:31 AM1 comment Dakin Campbell   (c) 2016, Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs’s commitment to fixed-income trading through a seven-year slump paid off in the third quarter, as revenue from the business surged 49 percent to propel the firm past analysts’ earnings estimates. The rebound in bond trading added to the second quarter’s 33 percent advance, validating Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein’s strategy of sticking with the business as some competitors pulled back. The gains helped fuel a 47 percent increase in earnings for the three months ended Sept. 30, the New York-based firm said Tuesday in a statement. Blankfein, 62, has been cutting jobs, giving more responsibility to junior employees and lowering compensation to prepare the firm for when activity rebounds from the downturn, which saw industrywide revenue from fixed income fall by half last year compared with 2009. JPMorgan Chase reported third-quarter bond-trading revenue last week that beat estimates by $1 billion, and Citigroup said revenue from the business surged 35 percent. “For a really slow start to a year where you are digging yourself out of a hole, you get a couple good quarters and that pendulum around sentiment swings back to the middle,” Devin Ryan, an analyst at JMP Securities, said in an interview. “People say, ‘Maybe I shouldn’t be so dire about the outlook for this business."‘ Goldman Sachs’s stock rose 2.3 percent to $172.90 at 9:35 a.m. in New York, the second-best performance on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The shares have dropped 6.2 percent this year through Monday, trailing the 3.8 percent advance for the Dow. The bank is trying to show investors it can generate a return on equity above its cost of capital after years of returns often in excess of 20 percent were the envy of the industry. ROE in the third quarter was 11.2 percent annualized. Fixed-income trading revenue climbed to $1.96 billion excluding year-earlier accounting adjustments, beating the $1.7 billion average estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Equities-trading revenue of $1.78 billion surpassed the $1.69 billion estimate. The sales-and-trading division is overseen by Isabelle Ealet, Pablo Salame and Ashok Varadhan. Net income rose to $2.09 billion, or $4.88 a share, from $1.43 billion, or $2.90, a year earlier, according to the statement. That surpassed the $3.88 average estimate of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net revenue in the quarter rose 19 percent to $8.17 billion. That compares with the $7.41 billion estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg. Expenses increased 10 percent to $5.3 billion, higher than the $4.9 billion estimate, as compensation and benefits jumped 36 percent from a year earlier. Through the first nine months, the company set aside 41 percent of revenue to pay its employees, up from 40 percent in the same period last year. Revenue from investment banking -- run by Richard Gnodde, David Solomon and John Waldron -- declined 1.2 percent to $1.54 billion, beating the $1.47 billion estimate. Debt-underwriting revenue increased 17 percent to $652 million, topping the $586 million estimate. Revenue from equity underwriting rose 19 percent to $227 million, missing the $233 million estimate, and advisory revenue dropped 19 percent to $658 million, falling short of the $685 million estimate. Revenue from investment management, run by Tim O’Neill and Eric Lane, climbed 4.4 percent to $1.49 billion, while the investing and lending division, which houses the firm’s debt and equity stakes, posted revenue that more than doubled to $1.4 billion. Goldman Sachs enacted at least four rounds of job reductions in New York this year that accounted for more than 400 dismissals. It also extended cuts in its fixed-income division to roughly 10 percent of staff, double what it normally culls each year, and eliminated dozens of managing directors, executive directors and vice presidents across the mergers and debt and equity capital-markets teams. In recent weeks, Goldman Sachs has reduced its projection for job cuts in Asia. The firm now intends to trim about 15 percent of its investment-banking jobs in Asia outside Japan, fewer than the 25 percent, or 75 positions, initially considered last month, a person with knowledge of the matter said Monday. The company has also sought to develop new businesses to help generate revenue and boost returns. The bank this month began offering loans through its online-lending platform, which offers unsecured consumer credit. It also has an online deposit-taking franchise that it purchased from General Electric Co. this year. Consumers can open a savings account there with as little as $1. --- Bloomberg’s Yalman Onaran contributed. goldman Keywords: GOLDMAN-FIXED-INCOME Sign up for e-mail news updates.   Recommended for You {{m[i].title}} {{shortdesc}} {{m[i].title}} {{shortdesc}} Popular Galleries Trunk-Or-Treat in Farr West Remembering Joe Martinez Men of Song South Ogden defeats Sand Ridge for Weber district football title Delta Defeats Morgan Prep Football Playoffs Fremont beats Taylorsville in 5-A quarterfinals American Fork defeats Syracuse in 5-A quarterfinals Weber State hoops beats Black Hills in exhibition   332 Standard Way, Ogden UT 84412 801-625-4200 · 1-800-651-2105 Announcements News Teen Suicide Police & Fire Sports Weber State Utah Jazz Standard Stars Ogden Raptors BYU Utah Utes Utah State NBA Entertainment Lifestyle Opinion Terms of Service | Privacy Policy Ogden Publishing Corporation All rights reserved.

MUST CREDIT: Bloomberg photo by Xaume Olleros. China casino detentions cast pall over Macau’s recovery Traffic passes by the Crown Casino complex in Melbourne, Australia, March 19, 2016. (Jason Reed/Reuters) By DANIELA WEI BLOOMBERG China’s detention of 18 Crown Resorts Ltd. employees may have been intended as a warning to foreign casinos, but it’s also unsettling gambling businesses in Macau, the nation’s own betting enclave. In theory, the detentions of workers at the Australian company late last week shouldn’t affect Chinese casinos and could even help them by putting higher scrutiny on competitors outside of Macau. But a more watchful government eye is unwelcome in an industry that has been roiled by corruption crackdowns in the past few years. Just hours after the news of China’s clampdown on the Australian casino company, at least three Macau junket operators said they have called off meetings with Chinese high-rollers. The operators, who lend money to VIP visitors who bet hundreds of thousands of dollars during excursions to the former Portuguese colony, asked not to be identified as the plans are confidential. Gambling revenue has just starting to rebound after two years of declines in Macau’s $29 billion gaming market, where foreign companies run casinos with Chinese partners. The question is whether that nascent recovery can survive a renewed focus on foreign casino operators that market in China. “The Crown incident is raising concerns in Macau’s gaming market,” said Ben Lee, managing partner at Asian gaming consultancy IGamiX. “We expect the direct VIP and premium mass market will dive over the next several months.” The Chinese government hasn’t specified any of the charges. The Foreign Ministry has only said the Australians are being detained for gambling-related crimes based on China’s laws. Not only is it illegal to gamble in China. Anyone who entices its citizens overseas to bet, or try to force them to repay debts later, can be punished with jail terms. While gambling is legal in Macau, the gaming hub is highly regulated in other ways. The medium-term impact for Macau’s casinos “could be limited as there’s little evidence to suggest the crackdown could involve ‘local’ casinos or junkets,” JPMorgan Chase analyst DS Kim wrote in a note. “There was no meaningful impact on Macau’s VIP or premium-mass after the Korean casino incidents last year. We don’t see why this Australian case is different.” The next few weeks will determine if the Crown detentions have a more widespread chilling effect. Casinos in Macau are expected to stop sending marketing executives across the border to facilitate fund transfers and entertain high-rollers and the next category of elite players known as premium mass, said Lee. To avoid scrutiny, the junket operators said they won’t travel to meet high-stakes players in Guangdong province and Shanghai that were scheduled in upcoming weeks. “It is almost a certainty that Macau will see shorter-term operational pressures,” said Daiwa Capital Markets Hong Kong analyst Jamie Soo. “It is uncertain how long the impact will last as it remains to be seen what steps China will take.” Of course, rival casinos in other countries are also likely to pull back on marketing in China because of the detentions. In the short-term, Asia casinos will stop aggressively promoting in China for a while, hurting their high-roller revenue, said JPMorgan’s Kim. Further out, foreign casinos — such as in South Korea, the Philippines and Singapore — will be increasingly careful about marketing, hurting their ability to acquire new players, Kim said. China arrested employees of Korean casino operators Paradise Co. and Grand Korea Leisure Co. in June last year. All six of its employees who were arrested have been released after serving jail time, a Paradise spokeswoman said Monday. Out of Grand Korea’s seven jailed employees, three were set free in August and four on Monday, its spokesman said Tuesday. The latest detentions also pose uncertainties for the planned spinoff of international assets by Australian billionaire James Packer’s Crown, including its stake in Macau casino operator Melco Crown Entertainment. The split had been designed to isolate Crown’s Australian casino business from the wider group, which Crown Chairman Robert Rankin said investors undervalued because of Macau’s gambling downturn. Crown still owns a 30 percent stake in Nasdaq-listed Melco Crown, which saw its net income tumble last year amid the Macau slump. “We will continue to make all efforts needed to observe evolving requirements,” Melco Crown said in a statement when asked about the impact of the latest detentions, adding that its marketing practices “are guided by the prevailing legal requirements.” The company declined to comment on the Crown detentions.

But the Wall Street firm's surprisingly strong earnings report Tuesday was grounded in one of its oldest businesses: trading. Goldman's trading and investment-banking core performed strongly, in line with rivals like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. that also benefited from investors shifting around their portfolios in response to mixed signals from the Federal Reserve on interest-rate policy and uncertainty surrounding the U.K.'s exit from the European Union. Wednesday, Morgan Stanley, another investment bank that depends heavily on trading and corporate advice, is slated to report earnings, with expectations running high after a string of better-than-expected bank results. At Goldman, revenue jumped 19% to $8.17 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected Goldman to earn $ 3.82 a share on revenue of $7.42 billion. Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz attributed the improved performance to the absence of major setbacks as well as a low bar set by 2015's third quarter, when sluggish trading activity led to one of the worst quarters during Mr. Blankfein's decadelong tenure atop the firm. The bank's profitability also improved. Goldman's 11.2% return on equity was the best among trading-oriented firms so far this quarter and marks the first time Goldman has returned more than 10% -- its theoretical cost of capital -- since early last year. Still, the strong quarter wasn't enough to pull Goldman to positive growth for 2016. Firmwide revenue of $22.4 billion through the first nine months is down 15% from last year, and each of Goldman's four business lines has earned less than it did in 2015. While trading carried third- quarter results, Goldman's first foray into consumer credit generated numerous analyst questions for Mr. Schwartz. The unit made its first loan this week, he noted. Goldman's online deposit platform, which opened to the public in the spring and has grown in part through an acquisition of GE Capital's deposits, are small compared to behemoths like J.P. Morgan. "The firm is as focused on navigating today's environment as we are on preparing for the future," Mr. Schwartz said. "You have to do the first really well to be in a position to do the latter." Goldman's trading revenue rose 17% to $3.75 billion, and in fixed-income, currency and commodity trading -- Goldman's specialty -- revenue rose 34% to $1.96 billion. Stock-trading revenue edged up 2% to $1.78 billion, compared with sharp decreases at Bank of America and Citigroup Inc. Overall, trading didn't rely on any big one-time events, Mr. Schwartz said. That suggests a turnaround, following a better-than-expected second quarter, could have legs -- welcome news to Goldman investors who have watched trading revenue swing and sputter for years. What's more, Goldman made more money while taking less risk. Value at risk, a measure of how much the firm could lose on an average day, fell to $57 million in the quarter. That is down from $62 million last quarter and a postcrisis low. It suggests the firm is becoming more efficient with its risk taking. "The third quarter has been tough the past few years, so expectations were low," Barclays PLC analyst Jason Goldberg said. "People just forgot what a normal quarter could look like, especially in fixed income." Also helping boost results were a slightly lower tax rate and buybacks that cut the share count to an all-time low. Shares rose 2.2%, the best-performing big bank stock on the day. On the investment-banking side, underwriting revenue rose 18%, with gains evenly shared between debt and stock sales. One potential trouble spot was a 19% decline in fees from arranging mergers, though Mr. Schwartz said the pipeline of unannounced deals was "pretty good" and that the factors that have driven record deal making remain, such as cheap debt and slower economic growth. Despite Goldman's recent push into consumer businesses, the firm still relies heavily on investment banking and trading to generate profits. Those divisions have been hurt over the past year by increasingly skittish clients, reduced volatility and quieter initial public offerings markets. In response, Goldman has shed several hundred jobs this year, including traders in New York and London and investment bankers in Asia. Noncompensation expenses fell 15% from a year earlier, as Goldman automates some tasks and shifts jobs to lower- cost places like Salt Lake City and Warsaw. Compensation expenses have edged up slightly this year to 41% of revenue, but that is roughly on pace with last year and almost 10 percentage points lower than in the heyday of Wall Street pay. Head count is down 5% from a year earlier. Revenue from Goldman's investment-and-lending arm, a $99 billion collection of debt and equity holdings, more than doubled from a year earlier to $1.4 billion. The mix of holdings has shifted more toward debt than equity and is now 78% invested in credit, Mr. Schwartz said.

The increase in banking sector non performing loans (NPLs) to 11 per cent, far above the five per cent threshold that was set by the regulator has also been the focus of industry analysts in recent times. Crude oil price has declined by about 50per cent between mid-2014 and mid-2016 to about $50 per barrel presently, thereby leading to significant losses in export earnings for Nigeria and other commodity exporters. This has seriously affected purchasing power in the country as individuals and firms find it difficult to honour their obligations with banks. However, with forecasts of uncertainties and risks in the global economy, the recent results from the three world’s biggest banks which showed decline in earnings in their third quarter results raises fresh concerns of spill over effects on Nigerian banks. Citigroup last week reported that its net income fell by 9.5 per cent to $3.8 billion, from $4.2 billion the same quarter a year ago. Its revenues were also down 3.8 per cent to $17.8 billion during the July-September period, from $18.5 billion the same period last year. After the release of the results, shares of Citigroup fell 2.4 percent to $48.39 after opening Friday at $48.60 on the U.S. stock market. Similarly, JP Morgan Chase’s net income fell 7.3 percent to $6.3 billion. That’s was down from $6.8 billion. Its revenues, however, rose 8.5 percent to $25.5 billion after posting $23.5 billion in the third quarter of 2015. Shares of the bank fell 2.2 percent to $67.30 after they began the day at $68.80. Stirred with illegal banking activities, Wells Fargo’s earnings were highly anticipated. The bank said last Friday that its net income fell 3.4 percent to $5.6 billion in third quarter of 2016, from $5.8 billion during the same period a year ago. Revenues were up 1.8 percent to $22.3 billion from $21.9 billion. After opening at $45.17, shares of Wells Fargo fell 1.8 percent to $44.33. But the Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Derivatives Company Limited, Mr. Bismarck Rewane, pointed out that the afformetioned three global banks are strong decline the reduction in their earnings. “The banks are solid. They all passed the stress test. They did stress test in Europe and the United States and they all passed. So, both on a credit rating basis and capital adequacy basis, the banks are sound and solid,” he explained. He dismissed the insinuation of a likely contagion effect, saying they total size of Nigerian banking system is insignificant Nonetheless, adverse commodity price shocks, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) can also contribute to financial fragility through various channels. Firstly, a decline in commodity prices in commodity-dependent countries results in reduced export income, which could adversely impact economic activity and agents’ (including governments) ability to meet their debt obligations, thereby potentially weakening banks’ balance sheets. Secondly, a surge in bank withdrawals following a drop in commodity prices may significantly reduce banks’ liquidity and potentially lead to a liquidity mismatch. Financial fragility can be defined as the increased likelihood of a systemic failure in the financial system, for which the most obvious indicator would be a systemic banking crisis. Last year, the regulator gave three commercial banks until June 2016 to recapitalise after they failed to hit a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 15per cent. CBN’s Assurance But the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Mr. Godwin Emefiele pointed out that a recent reports of the World Economic Outlook showed weakness in the global economy “When you have situation where there is a weak global outlook as we have now, practically all financial market suffer same kind of issues such as weakening of balance sheets and the rest of them. “But I must say that for the Nigerian banking environment, it is not as bad as people may think, given that we have strong prudential guidelines and ratios in place. I think we can only continue to strengthen the banks by putting in place strong prudential regulations that would continue to shield the banks and protect depositors,” the CBN governor said. The CBN also allayed concerns over the soundness of Nigerian banks, assuring the public that they are sound and have strong capital buffers. However, the Director, Banking Supervision, CBN, Mrs. Tokunbo Martins, admitted that just like in other oil and commodity-dependent economies, banks in the country were also feeling the headwinds in the economy. She added: “That is not to say that the banking sector is not feeling the economic headwinds, they are. Just like every other jurisdiction. It is not strange. NPLs at 11 per cent is not what we need to focus on. What we need to focus on is if the banks have the capacity to absorb losses that may arise from those NPLs? And the answer is yes. They have very strong capital buffers. “Another thing that is important is that Nigerian banks have very huge capacity to generate income to also absorb those losses, if they do arise. And then the loans that are non-performing, can they re-perform? Yes they will because the underlying assets are still there and they are good. “The fact that the country has NPLs at a period like this should be expected and is not a thing that any jurisdiction should be demonised about. “Other jurisdictions going through what we are also going through are experiencing the same thing. There are countries that have NPLs as high as 15 per cent, some 30 per cent, and some countries in Europe have NPLs as high as 80 per cent.” Risk of Downgrade Despite the assurance from the central bank, Fitch, an international ratings agency, acknowledged that banks in the country had experienced a sharp rise in NPLs, adding that other key concerns in the banking industry include forex scarcity, weakening capital adequacy ratios, and the sovereign’s ability to support banks, given its weaker financial flexibility. “If current challenges do not ease, the banks could face further downgrades,” Fitch said. Fitch Ratings also warned of downgrades if NPLs continued to deteriorate. Worsening NPL trends in the sector have accelerated since the end of 2015. Fitch expects this to continue because operating conditions remain difficult. The CBN’s latest financial stability report released this week showed that the sector’s NPLs rose to 11.7 per cent of gross loans as of June ending 2016 from 5.3 per cent at the end of 2015. This exceeded Fitch’s start-of-year expectations of a 10 per cent NPL ratio by the end of 2016. But NPLs are not evenly spread among banks and sector NPL ratios are distorted by some exceptionally high concentrations. For example, First Bank of Nigeria, the country’s largest bank, reported a 23 per cent NPL ratio at end-June 2016. “If current challenges do not ease, the banks could face further downgrades. Our discussions with banks indicate that most impairment is concentrated in the private sector, which is affected by foreign currency shortages and the depreciation of the naira. “Borrowers are struggling to access scarce FC and those dependent on naira income are finding it hard to meet escalating repayment costs triggered by the depreciation. “Sector NPLs would have been higher if banks had not undertaken widespread restructuring of loans to the oil and gas sector, which accounts for 30 per cent of total sector loans,” Fitch added. On his part, a former CBN Governor, Prof. Charles Chukwuma Soludo has called on the CBN as well as other central bankers across the globe to start taking preemptive, proactive contingency planning, in anticipation of the next global crisis, which according to him might happen in few years’ time. According to him, there is a whole lot of uncertainty and risks everywhere, saying that it would take one major crisis in one country and it will snowball into another global crisis. He argued that there was an uptick in the level of uncertainties in the global economy, saying that the world was yet to get over the 2008-2009 global financial crisis. He pointed out that there was still tepid growth in Europe and America, as well as concerns over China. Soludo stressed that the key thing for central banks and policy makers over the world to be concerned about ought to be the state of affairs of the global economy and the financial system.

The New York-based firm reported a profit of $2.09 billion, or $4.88 a share. That compares with $1.43 billion, or $2.90 a share, in the same period last year. Revenue grew 19% to $8.17 billion from $6.86 billion a year earlier, when sluggish trading activity across Wall Street -- particularly in fixed-income, where Goldman is strongest -- dragged down earnings. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected Goldman to earn $3.82 a share on revenue of $7.42 billion. Shares climbed 1.5% premarket. "We saw solid performance across the franchise that helped counter typical seasonal weakness," Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said in prepared remarks. "We continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively and are benefiting from the breadth of our offerings to clients." Goldman's return on equity, a closely watched measure of profitability, stood at 11.2% in the third quarter. It was 7% in the year-earlier quarter and hadn't exceeded 10% -- the firm' theoretical cost of capital -- since early 2015. Investors' expectations of a strong quarter built in recent days after rivals including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. reported big boosts in their trading businesses. Goldman's trading revenue increased 17% to $3.75 billion from $3.21 billion in the same quarter last year. That was driven largely by a 34% increase in revenue from fixed income, currency and commodities trading. Meanwhile, equities trading revenue edged up 2%, helped by derivatives. The bank gets the biggest chunk of its revenue from trading, where it buys and sells stocks, bonds, currencies and other instruments on behalf of investing clients. Goldman shares are up 14% since the end of the second quarter but remain down 6.2% year to date, worse than a 2.9% decline in the KBW Nasdaq Bank index. The New York firm is more reliant than many of its rivals on trading, which typically makes up half the firmwide revenue. Goldman has been disproportionately bruised by the volatility and overall decline in trading activity since the financial crisis. Investment banking revenue, which include merger advisory and underwriting fees, fell 1.2% to $1.54 billion from $1.56 billion in the third quarter of 2015. Goldman said its financial advisory revenue declined 19% to $658 million in the quarter, reflecting an industrywide decline in completed mergers and acquisitions. But its underwriting revenue grew 18% to $879 million amid a boom in debt underwriting. Revenue from Goldman's investment-and-lending arm, a collection of debt and equity holdings, more than doubled to $1.4 billion from $670 million a year prior. That business tends to swing wildly as positions are marked to market, and began 2016 with its worst quarter in five years. The firm's investment management arm, which oversees money for pension funds and other big institutional investors, posted revenue of $1.49 billion, up 4.4% from $1.42 billion last year. It has seen inflows over the past year, a rarity among active managers as investors shift toward passive strategies. Despite Goldman's recent push into consumer-facing businesses, such as offering savings accounts and online loans, the firm still relies heavily on its investment banking and trading businesses. Skittish clients, reduced volatility and quieter IPO markets have dinged those divisions over the past year. In response, Goldman has shed several hundred jobs this year, including traders in New York and London and investment bankers in Asia. Expenses in the third quarter rose 10% from a year earlier to $5.3 billion, as Goldman's accrual for compensation and benefits increased 36% to $3.21 billion and non-compensation expenses slid 15% to $2.09 billion.

Earnings from the financials dominate the early part of earnings season, setting the pace for the rest of the period, and so far it looks pretty good. The big banks that have reported so far have largely exceeded the Street's forecast, with trading revenue, loan growth and interest income among the highlights. Last Friday, JPMorgan Chase was one of the first of the big banks out of the gate with earnings. The largest U.S. bank by assets reported earnings per share of $1.58 on revenues of $25.51 billion, topping estimates by 19 cents per share and revenue by more than $1.5 billion. Working with analytics firm Kensho, CNBC ran a screen looking at how the markets performed two weeks after JPMorgan beat earnings per share estimates by at least 18 cents. In the past decade, JPMorgan topped earnings per share estimates by at least 18 cents on eight occasions, and two weeks later the Dow Jones industrial average traded positively 75 percent of the time, returning an average of just under 1 percent. The S&P 500 and the largest financial ETF, the XLF, were also consistently positive on average, though to a lesser degree, each trading up 63 percent of the time. JPMorgan itself has historically been a coin flip, trading positively half the time, gaining an average of 1.2 percent. This historical trend continued when looking at Goldman Sachs after a big beat. The investment bank posted third-quarter earnings Tuesday morning of $4.88 per share, on revenue of $8.17 billion, beating the Street's earnings per share estimates by $1.06 a share and revenue expectations by $740 million. Using Kensho once again with the same parameters, we found a similar story. The S&P was consistently positive, up 82 percent of the time, with an average return of 1.2 percent. The Dow and the XLF are also historically positive, each finishing better 64 percent of the time, returning an average of 1.27 percent and 0.47 percent respectively. Most surprisingly, perhaps, Goldman Sachs itself was negative more often than positive, on average, down 55 percent of the time, but still managing an average return of 0.49 percent.

Fiji Time: 7:48 PM on Monday 14 November Home Politics Local Sport World Letters Editorial Nai Lalakai Business Features Classifieds Weather Gallery Archives / Front page / Business Customers reap rich card travel awards Reuters Wednesday, October 19, 2016 Morrie Low, a 27-year-old Seattle cocktail server, has found an unlikely new source of pleasure: credit card companies. After working off card balances he built up during college, Mr Low started collecting new cards in May specifically to reap the increasingly lucrative travel awards banks are offering to encourage spending on their cards. In August, Mr Low snagged a new Sapphire Reserve card, from JPMorgan Chase & Co, which has become a magnet for millennials willing to pay the $450 annual fee for a sign-up bonus worth as much as $1500 in travel, plus $300 in annual spending credits and more freebies. Now he is planning a trip to Germany with his girlfriend on JPMorgan's dime. "I have never been to Europe, so that is something pretty cool about this hobby," he said. The Reserve card opens up a new front in the war among banks to build up their lucrative credit card businesses. While it may be fun for customers, investors and analysts worry that the battle will eat away the fat profit margins that made the sector so attractive to banks in the first place. "You have five or six big national players and they are going around killing one another," said Chris Kotowski, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. Mr Low illustrates the problem. JPMorgan won't know if he will become a profitable customer for another year because the up-front rewards are so great. He may drop the Reserve card before the next annual fee. He has already acquired two more cards and is now spending on those to meet their requirements for more sign-up bonuses. And he doesn't intend to borrow on his cards. That could be bad for JPMorgan because credit card companies historically have made about three-fourths of their revenue from interest. The rest has come from fees, which are being whittled away by the rising costs of the givebacks. Back to top Fiji Times & Kaila Frontpage PDF Downloads Use the free Acrobat Reader to view.

Adam Shell , USA TODAY 4:44 p.m. EDT October 18, 2016 Trader Ryan Falvey works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 17, 2016. (Photo: Richard Drew, AP) Corporate earnings growth is again flashing green after four quarters of drowning in red. Profit reports that topped Wall Street forecasts at the start of the third-quarter reporting season have nudged the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index's earnings growth rate into positive territory, raising hopes that the earnings recession that began in the second half of 2015 is coming to an end. Thanks to earnings "beats" this week from financial titan Goldman Sachs, health care giant Johnson & Johnson and video streaming service Netflix, the earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 on Tuesday swung from negative to positive, edging higher to +0.2%, up from a projected contraction of -0.5% on Oct. 1, according to Thomson Reuters. After four straight quarters in which the S&P 500 posted earnings that were smaller than the same period a year earlier, earnings may finally be moving in the right direction powered by banks and tech companies. USA TODAY Average retired Social Security beneficiary to get measly $5 raise in 2017 "The third quarter is shaping up to be a key inflection point and ultimately a positive catalyst for stocks," Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, noted. Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, U.S. equity strategist at JPMorgan, said in a report that he expects S&P 500 earnings to top current analyst profit forecasts by 3 or 4 percentage points, which would equate to low, single-digit profit growth for the just-ended third quarter. Driving the earnings rebound, Lakos-Bujas says, is improving economic growth in the U.S. and overseas, rising commodity prices and a stabilization in the U.S. dollar, as a weaker dollar makes American products cheaper overseas and helps boost sales and profits. But while the good news is the profit recession could be nearing an end, the bad news is that future profits — despite lofty estimates for coming quarters — might not be as strong as expected, says Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. "I doubt earnings growth will be robust going forward," he says, citing falling productivity, a still slow-growth economy and rising wages. He also says profit could be impacted by faster-than-expected interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. Much of the negativity surrounding earnings is due to the depressed earnings in the oil patch, which has clouded an otherwise solid profit picture for most other sectors. If you strip out the energy sector, the S&P 500 has only suffered one quarter of negative earnings (the first quarter of 2016), according to Citigroup strategist Tobias Levkovich. "The alleged earnings 'recession,' " Levkovich argued in a recent report "actually reflects an oil and gas depression which appears to be reversing." Indeed, the price of U.S.-produced crude oil is back above $50 per barrel after briefly trading in the mid-$20s back in January. 1 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2eq5Arf
