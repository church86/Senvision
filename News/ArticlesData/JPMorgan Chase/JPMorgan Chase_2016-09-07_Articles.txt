Enthusiasts extol its virtues all over the internet. Millennials are clamoring for it. It's not a new video game, or some fancy food craze, or even Apple's latest iPhone, but a credit card. Calling it plastic wouldn't do it justice. It is a high-end, high-fee, high-reward card made of a metallic alloy that gives it a satisfying heft and an impressive thunk when you toss it onto the table to pick up the check. This photo provided by JPMorgan Chase shows a likeness of the bank's newest credit card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card. The card has become the hottest credit card on the market after being available only two weeks, to the point of running out of the metal cards used to make it. (JPMorgan Chase via AP) The Chase Sapphire Reserve Card has become the hottest card on the market just two weeks after being introduced, even though it came out during the slow, end-of-summer period, it carries a hefty $450 annual fee, and JPMorgan Chase spent nothing on advertising it. "I'm telling all my friends about it," said Maddy Novich, 33, of New York, who applied for the card, as did her husband. Like so many crazes these days, this one has been fueled by social media, word of mouth and the internet. Frequent travelers and those who try to game travel-loyalty programs have been writing extensively about the card on blogs and forums. "I have never seen such interest in a credit card, and I've been doing this for 15 years," said Gary Leff, who runs the travel and points blog View From the Wing . Chase has approved tens of thousands of applications for the card, said spokeswoman Lauren Francis. Most of the customers are millennials, who typically shun credit cards and are not usually a target for high-fee, ultra-premium plastic. The demand has been so high that Chase ran out of the alloy, whose composition is a trade secret. Customers are being issued temporary plastic cards. "We quickly ordered more, but because they are handcrafted, they take more time to make," said Lisa Walker, general manager of Chase's Sapphire credit card program. Credit cards with high fees but generous rewards are aimed at well-to-do customers who spend and travel extensively. The market has long been dominated by American Express with its Platinum Card. So why's the Chase card so hot? Chase offers a 100,000-point sign-up bonus if the customer meets certain spending targets. Those points can be worth up to $1,500 in travel rewards. They can also be converted to hotel or airline points that could secure, oh, a dreamy hotel suite in the Maldives or a first-class ticket for, say, a honeymoon. The card also comes with a $300 annual credit toward travel, which effectively makes the annual fee really $150. It has a generous points-earning program, with triple points on travel and dining, and gives access to airport lounges. "It's one of the best offers I've ever seen. With the amount of travel and dining we do, I saw it as a worthwhile card to get," Novich said. The card's metal composition is also clearly part of the appeal. Only a handful of other credit cards are metal, including the American Express Centurion Card, commonly known as the AmEx "black card," which is typically available only to millionaires, billionaires and celebrities. Kayla Kania, a 33-year-old manager at an accounting firm from Rockville, Maryland, proudly posted a picture of her new Chase card on Instagram and said she has received compliments about it from cashiers and a co-worker. "The metal part of it, people get excited about it. It's weird," she said. She added: "It's such a conversation piece." ___ On the Net: https://we.tl/fDJOLtm7y7 ___ Ken Sweet covers banking and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Sep 8, 2016 at 9:21AM Image source: Getty Images. MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) stock received a massive upgrade last week, as JPMorgan promoted the company from neutral to overweight and raised its price target by more than 50%, from $133 to $200 per share. MercadoLibre stock is trading above $186 per share as of the time of this writing, so JP Morgan's price target is only 7.5% above the current price.  Since MercadoLibre stock has gained over 60% year to date, we could say that the recommendation comes behind the curve. However, the research note from JPMorgan highlights the fact that growth is accelerating, and this is a major positive for investors in the company. MercadoLibre is gaining steam As a general rule, growth tends to slow down as a company gains size and market penetration levels increase over the years. This is just a natural phenomenon in the business world, since sustaining rapid growth in percentage terms is relatively easier when the business is still young and the revenue base is small. In MercadoLibre's particular case, the company operates 100% in Latin America, and many countries in the region are struggling with economic instability lately.  However, you wouldn't have guessed that by looking at MercadoLibre's financial reports for the second quarter of 2016. Not only is the business firing on all cylinders, but growth is even accelerating under challenging conditions.  Items sold in the company's e-commerce platform reached 43.7 million units during the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 44.7% versus the same period one year ago. This is the fastest growth rate that MercadoLibre has reported since 2009. Different indicators across the board are pointing in the same direction. Gross merchandise volume reached more than $2 billion last quarter, a 21.2% increase in U.S. dollars and growing 67.9% in local currencies. Total revenue amounted to $199.6 million, an annual increase of 29.4% in U.S. dollars and a 72.5% jump in local currencies.  MercadoLibre owns a digital payments platform called MercadoPago, and performance in this business looks stronger than ever. Total payment transactions were 31.9 million last quarter, a 76% increase versus the second quarter in 2015. Total payment volume reached $1.8 billion, growing 50.6% in dollars and 101.6% in local currencies. MercadoPago's on-platform penetration reached a record high of 75% last quarter, almost 20% points higher than in the second quarter of 2015. Brazil is MercadoLibre's biggest market, and its economy has been under considerable pressure over the past several years. According to estimates from OECD, Brazil's GDP is expected to contract by 4.3% in 2016, while inflation is forecasted to be in the area of 9.2% during the year.   In spite of these difficulties, MercadoLibre is producing record performance in this key market, and this is one of the main reasons why JPMorgan upgraded the stock. According to analyst Andre Baggio, as quoted by Barron's: MercadoLibre's best performing operation is Brazil, despite being its largest and likely most penetrated market, signaling that e-commerce is still at initial stages, given 4% of retail penetration. Revenue growth in the country reached 61% year-over-year, reaching one of the highest levels on disclosed record, which we attribute to increased confidence from Brazilian consumers on e-commerce and marketplace platforms in general. Moving forward MercadoLibre is the undisputed market leader in all of the main countries where it operates, and the company is consolidating its competitive position on the back of brand recognition generating customer trust. Besides, an expanding ecosystem of services in areas such as payments, shipping, and advertising make the platform increasingly valuable to both buyers and sellers. The economy in Latin America tends to be particularly unstable, but the e-commerce industry is gaining acceptance among customers, and growth is accelerating. Management calculates that nearly 9.9% of all retail sales in the U.S. will happen online in 2016, while the number is a much lower 3% in Latin America. This indicates that the Latin America e-commerce industry should be fertile ground for growth going forward, and no company is better positioned than MercadoLibre to profit from such opportunity.  MercadoLibre stock is aggressively priced in terms of current earnings, but valuation doesn't look too excessive when factoring growth into the equation. In terms of PEG ratio, which measures price-to-earnings ratio adjusted by growth expectations, MercadoLibre looks, in fact, cheaper than bigger industry players such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).  Looking at the table below, the Latin American player looks fairly priced versus Amazon and eBay, and its market value still has room to run. Company Market Cap  P/E Ratio 5-Year Expected Growth Rate PEG Ratio MercadoLibre $7.68 billion 62.9 24.3% 2.6 Amazon $373.1 billion 196.7 50.6% 3.9 eBay $36.42 billion 19.4 5.7% 3.4 Data source: FinViz.  In a nutshell, MercadoLibre is gaining steam in spite of growing market penetration and difficult economic conditions in Latin America. The stock is priced for demanding expectations, but its valuation doesn't seem unreasonable for such a promising growth business. With this in mind, it's not too hard to understand why Wall Street analysts are increasingly bullish on MercadoLibre stock. Andrés Cardenal owns shares of Amazon.com and MercadoLibre.

 JPMorgan just made two big promotions in a key trading business Matt Turner Sep. 7, 2016, 11:15 AM 6,040 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. Thomson Reuters JPMorgan has announced two new coheads of its equities business, following the departure of Tim Throsby to Barclays. The bank announced today that Mark Leung and Jason Sippel would become global coheads of equities, effective immediately. They will also manage the prime services business, which caters to hedge funds, with James Kenny. They will also join the corporate and investment bank management team. Both Leung and Sippel are longtime JPMorgan employees. Leung joined JPMorgan in 1997 and went through the bank's markets training program. He was most recently head of the equities business in Asia Pacific. Sippel has been with the bank for 14 years and was most recently global head of prime services, having previously headed Americas equities. JPMorgan has made its equities business a key focus in recent years. The bank finished 2015 ranked third for equities revenues, according to data from the analytics firm Coalition. That compares with a No. 1 ranking in fixed income, currencies and commodities, and investment banking. Cash equities, or stock trading, was the one business line in which the bank did not have a top-three ranking in 2015. "We are positioned incredibly well and yet, we still see more opportunities for us to invest and grow," Daniel Pinto, CEO of the corporate and investment bank, said in a memo announcing the changes.

That’s according to Adrian Mowat, the chief Asian and emerging-market equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase & Co., who predicts the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index will climb a further 11 percent by the end of the year. The benchmark gauge of mainland companies traded in the city jumped 8.8 percent in the month through Tuesday to beat all global indexes tracked by Bloomberg. Mowat said investors are still too downbeat on the nation’s equities given better-than-estimated profits by companies most exposed to swings in economic growth. Some 65 percent of stocks on the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index beat expectations in the first half of the year, the best performance since 2012. Even after the rebound, the gauge trades at an earnings multiple 60 percent lower than the global average. “There’s too much pessimism around China," said Mowat, the Hong Kong-based strategist who turned bullish on the nation’s equities in April. “If you look at the profit numbers we’re beginning to see the cyclical sectors beat." The gauge of so-called H shares has rebounded 32 percent since reaching a seven-year low in February, when concern over China’s economic slowdown and heavy-handed state intervention in mainland financial markets had investors fleeing for the exits. The index, which is still 33 percent below last year’s peak in May, climbed 0.3 percent to a nine-month high on Wednesday. Insurers were among companies topping forecasts with first-half earnings. Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. reported an 18 percent increase in net income as growth in premiums and banking revenue helped offset the impact of stock-market declines. The earnings outlook for state-owned enterprises is still clouded. More than twice as many companies on the H-share index reported negative first-half growth than last year and the economic picture is subdued. Data on exports, industrial production and retail sales all fell short of economists’ estimates in July. "We’re not saying that China doesn’t have any structural problems, but perhaps after the big fall we saw in the A share market last year and all the concerns on the yuan, investors’ level of anxiety is still a little bit too high," Mowat said. The H-share index has climbed about 12 percent since he raised his rating on Chinese stocks to overweight. Relative Strength Technical indicators suggest the Hang Seng China Enterprise’s rebound is at risk of overheating. The gauge’s 14-day relative strength index has climbed above the 70 level that signals to some traders gains are overdone. Ping An’s RSI has risen to 72.7, while that of Bank of Communication Co. is the highest in a decade. Mowat’s forecasts haven’t always panned out in the past. He said last June that a slump in mainland shares would be a buying opportunity because of expected government support. The Shanghai Composite Index fell more than 30 percent in the next two months. Still, he’s not alone in seeing an extended rally in H shares. Deutsche Bank AG is also bullish, predicting in a note last week that profit growth by non-financial companies will accelerate in the second half, prompting analysts to raise their estimates. “If you get profits, you’ve got a little bit less of a risk premium and China does well," Mowat said. “So I’m upbeat about that."

Cautionary Statements and Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results This news release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical facts, but instead represent the current expectations of NextEra Energy Partners, LP (together with its subsidiaries, NEP) regarding future operating results and other future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of NEP's control. Forward-looking statements in this news release include, among others, statements concerning cash available for distributions expectations and future operating performance. In some cases, you can identify the forward-looking statements by words or phrases such as "will," "may result," "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "intend," "plan," "seek," "aim," "potential," "projection," "forecast," "predict," "goals," "target," "outlook," "should," "would" or similar words or expressions. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance. The future results of NEP and its business and financial condition are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause NEP's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, or may require it to limit or eliminate certain operations. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: NEP has a limited operating history and its projects include renewable energy projects with a limited operating history. Such projects may not perform as expected; NEP's ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders is affected by wind and solar conditions at its renewable energy projects; NEP's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects can be materially adversely affected by weather conditions, including, without limitation, the impact of severe weather; As a result of the acquisition of NET Holdings Management, LLC (the Texas pipeline business), NEP's operations and business have substantially changed. NEP's expansion into the natural gas pipeline industry may not be successful; NEP may fail to realize expected profitability or growth, and may incur unanticipated liabilities, as a result of the Texas pipelines acquisition; NEP is pursuing the expansion of natural gas pipelines in its portfolio that will require up-front capital expenditures and expose NEP to project development risks; NEP's ability to maximize the productivity of the Texas pipeline business and to complete potential pipeline expansion projects is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas production in the Texas pipelines' areas of operation; Operation and maintenance of renewable energy projects involve significant risks that could result in unplanned power outages, reduced output, personal injury or loss of life; The wind turbines at some of NEP's projects and some of NextEra Energy Resources, LLC's (NEER) right of first offer (ROFO) projects are not generating the amount of energy estimated by their manufacturers' original power curves, and the manufacturers may not be able to restore energy capacity at the affected turbines; NEP depends on the Texas pipelines and certain of the renewable energy projects in its portfolio for a substantial portion of its anticipated cash flows; Terrorist or similar attacks could impact NEP's projects or surrounding areas and adversely affect its business; NEP's energy production and pipeline transportation capability may be substantially below its expectations if severe weather or a natural disaster or meteorological conditions damage its turbines, solar panels, pipelines or other equipment or facilities; The ability of NEP to obtain insurance and the terms of any available insurance coverage could be materially adversely affected by international, national, state or local events and company-specific events, as well as the financial condition of insurers. NEP's insurance coverage does not insure against all potential risks and it may become subject to higher insurance premiums; Warranties provided by the suppliers of equipment for NEP's projects may be limited by the ability of a supplier to satisfy its warranty obligations, or by the terms of the warranty, so the warranties may be insufficient to compensate NEP for its losses; Supplier concentration at certain of NEP's projects may expose it to significant credit or performance risks; NEP relies on interconnection and transmission facilities of third parties to deliver energy from its renewable energy projects and, if these facilities become unavailable, NEP's wind and solar projects may not be able to operate or deliver energy; NEP's business is subject to liabilities and operating restrictions arising from environmental, health and safety laws and regulations; NEP's renewable energy projects may be adversely affected by legislative changes or a failure to comply with applicable energy regulations; A change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of the Texas pipeline  entities' assets, or a change in law or regulatory policy, could result in increased regulation of these assets, which could have material adverse effect on NEP's business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEP may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of pipeline integrity management program testing and any necessary pipeline repair or preventative or remedial measures; The Texas pipelines' operations could incur significant costs if the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety  Administration or the Railroad Commission of Texas adopts more stringent regulations; Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) may claim certain immunities under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act and Mexican law, and the Texas pipeline entities' ability to sue or recover from Pemex for breach of contract may be limited; Portions of NEP's pipeline systems have been in service for several decades. There could be unknown events or conditions or increased maintenance or repair expenses and downtime associated with NEP's pipelines that could have a material adverse effect on NEP's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make distributions; Natural gas operations are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures, increase NEP's cost of operations and affect or limit its business plans, or expose NEP to liabilities; Natural gas gathering and transmission activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents or otherwise affect the Texas pipelines' operations; NEP's partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of its common units, and under certain circumstances this could be reduced to 10%; NEP does not own all of the land on which the projects in its portfolio are located and its use and enjoyment of the property may be adversely affected to the extent that there are any lienholders or leaseholders that have rights that are superior to NEP's rights or the BLM suspends its federal rights-of-way grants; NEP is subject to risks associated with litigation or administrative proceedings that could materially impact its operations, including, without limitation, proceedings related to projects it acquires in the future; NEP's wind projects located in Canada are subject to Canadian domestic content requirements under their Feed-in-Tariff contracts; NEP's cross-border operations require NEP to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and non-U.S. jurisdictions; NEP is subject to risks associated with its ownership or acquisition of projects that remain under construction, which could result in its inability to complete construction projects on time or at all, and make projects too expensive to complete or cause the return on an investment to be less than expected; NEP relies on a limited number of customers and NEP is exposed to the risk that they are unwilling or unable to fulfill their contractual obligations to NEP or that they otherwise terminate their agreements with NEP; NEP may not be able to extend, renew or replace expiring or terminated power purchase agreements (PPAs) at favorable rates or on a long-term basis; NEP may be unable to secure renewals of long-term natural gas transportation agreements, which could expose its revenues to increased volatility; If the energy production by or availability of NEP's U.S. renewable energy projects is less than expected, they may not be able to satisfy minimum production or availability obligations under NEP's U.S. Project Entities' PPAs; If third-party pipelines and other facilities interconnected to the Texas pipelines become partially or fully unavailable to transport natural gas, NEP's revenues and cash available for distribution to unitholders could be adversely affected; NEP's growth strategy depends on locating and acquiring interests in additional projects consistent with its business strategy at favorable prices, NextEra Energy Operating Partners, LP's (NEP OpCo) partnership agreement requires that it distribute its available cash, which could limit NEP's ability to grow and make acquisitions; NEP's ability to consummate future acquisitions will depend on NEP's ability to finance those acquisitions; Lower prices for other fuel sources may reduce the demand for wind and solar energy; Reductions in demand for natural gas in the United States or Mexico and low market prices of natural gas could materially adversely affect the Texas pipelines' operations and cash flows; Government regulations providing incentives and subsidies for clean energy could change at any time and such changes may negatively impact NEP's growth strategy; NEP's growth strategy depends on the acquisition of projects developed by NextEra Energy, Inc. (NEE) and third parties, which face risks related to project siting, financing, construction, permitting, the environment, governmental approvals and the negotiation of project development agreements; Acquisitions of existing clean energy projects involve numerous risks; Renewable energy procurement is subject to U.S. state and Canadian provincial regulations, with relatively irregular, infrequent and often competitive procurement windows; NEP may continue to acquire other sources of clean energy, including, without limitation, natural gas and nuclear projects, and may expand to include other types of assets including, without limitation, transmission projects, and any further acquisition of non-renewable energy projects, including, without limitation, transmission projects, may present unforeseen challenges and result in a competitive disadvantage relative to NEP's more-established competitors. A failure to successfully integrate such acquisitions with NEP's then-existing projects as a result of unforeseen operational difficulties or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on NEP's business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to grow its business and make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEP faces substantial competition primarily from regulated utilities, developers, independent power producers, pension funds and private equity funds for opportunities in North America; The natural gas pipeline industry is highly competitive, and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect NEP's business; Risks Related to NEP's Financial Activities; NEP may not be able to access sources of capital on commercially reasonable terms, which would have a material adverse effect on its ability to consummate future acquisitions; Restrictions in NEP OpCo's subsidiaries' revolving credit facility and term loan agreements could adversely affect NEP's business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; NEP's cash distributions to its unitholders may be reduced as a result of restrictions on NEP's subsidiaries' cash distributions to NEP under the terms of their indebtedness; NEP's subsidiaries' substantial amount of indebtedness may adversely affect NEP's ability to operate its business and its failure to comply with the terms of its subsidiaries' indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on NEP's financial condition; Currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect NEP's operations; NEP is exposed to risks inherent in its use of interest rate swaps; NEE exercises substantial influence over NEP and NEP is highly dependent on NEE and its affiliates; NEER may lose key employees assigned to manage the Texas pipelines; NEP is highly dependent on credit support from NEE and its affiliates. NEP's subsidiaries may default under contracts or become subject to cash sweeps if credit support is terminated, if NEE or its affiliates fail to honor their obligations under credit support arrangements, or if NEE or another credit support provider ceases to satisfy creditworthiness requirements, and NEP will be required in certain circumstances to reimburse NEE for draws that are made on credit support; NEER or one of its affiliates is permitted to borrow funds received by NEP's subsidiaries, including, without limitation, NEP OpCo, as partial consideration for its obligation to provide credit support to NEP, and NEER will use these funds for its own account without paying additional consideration to NEP and is obligated to return these funds only as needed to cover project costs and distributions or as demanded by NEP OpCo. NEP's financial condition and ability to make distributions to its unitholders, as well as its ability to grow distributions in the future, is highly dependent on NEER's performance of its obligations to return all or a portion of these funds; NEP may not be able to consummate future acquisitions from NEER or from third parties; NextEra Energy Partners GP, Inc. (NEP GP) and its affiliates, including, without limitation, NEE, have conflicts of interest with NEP and limited duties to NEP and its unitholders, and they may favor their own interests to the detriment of NEP and holders of NEP common units; Common units are subject to NEP GP's limited call right; NEE and other affiliates of NEP GP are not restricted in their ability to compete with NEP; NEP may be unable to terminate the Management Services Agreement among NEP, NextEra Energy Management Partners, LP (NEE Management), NEP OpCo and NEP GP (MSA); If NEE Management terminates the MSA, NEER terminates the management sub-contract or either of them defaults in the performance of its obligations thereunder, NEP may be unable to contract with a substitute service provider on similar terms, or at all; NEP's arrangements with NEE limit NEE's liability, and NEP has agreed to indemnify NEE against claims that it may face in connection with such arrangements, which may lead NEE to assume greater risks when making decisions relating to NEP than it otherwise would if acting solely for its own account; The credit and business risk profiles of NEP GP and its owner, NEE, could adversely affect any NEP credit ratings and risk profile, which could increase NEP's borrowing costs or hinder NEP's ability to raise capital; NEP's ability to make distributions to its unitholders depends on the ability of NEP OpCo to make cash distributions to its limited partners; If NEP incurs material tax liabilities, NEP's distributions to its unitholders may be reduced, without any corresponding reduction in the amount of the IDR fee; Holders of NEP's common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect NEP's general partner or NEP GP's directors; NEP's partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of NEP's common units for actions taken by NEP GP that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duties; NEP's partnership agreement replaces NEP GP's fiduciary duties to holders of its common units with contractual standards governing its duties; Even if holders of NEP's common units are dissatisfied, they cannot initially remove NEP GP without NEE's consent; NEE's interest in NEP GP's and the control of NEP GP may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent; The IDR fee may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent; NEP may issue additional units without unitholder approval, which would dilute unitholder interests; Reimbursements and fees owed to NEP GP and its affiliates for services provided to NEP or on NEP's behalf will reduce cash distributions to or from NEP OpCo and from NEP to NEP's unitholders, and the amount and timing of such reimbursements and fees will be determined by NEP GP and there are no limits on the amount that NEP OpCo may be required to pay; Discretion in establishing cash reserves by NextEra Energy Operating Partners GP, LLC may reduce the amount of cash distributions to unitholders; While NEP's partnership agreement requires NEP to distribute its available cash, NEP's partnership agreement, including, without limitation, provisions requiring NEP to make cash distributions, may be amended; NEP OpCo can borrow money to pay distributions, which would reduce the amount of credit available to operate NEP's business; Increases in interest rates could adversely impact the price of NEP's common units, NEP's ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes and NEP's ability to make cash distributions to its unitholders; The price of NEP's common units may fluctuate significantly and unitholders could lose all or part of their investment and a market that will provide unitholders with adequate liquidity may not develop; The liability of holders of NEP's common units, which represent limited partnership interests in NEP, may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of NEP's business; Unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them; Except in limited circumstances, NEP GP has the power and authority to conduct NEP's business without unitholder approval; Contracts between NEP, on the one hand, and NEP GP and its affiliates, on the other hand, will not be the result of arm's-length negotiations; Unitholders have no right to enforce the obligations of NEP GP and its affiliates under agreements with NEP; NEP GP decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for NEP; The New York Stock Exchange does not require a publicly traded limited partnership like NEP to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements; NEP's future tax liability may be greater than expected if NEP does not generate NOLs sufficient to offset taxable income or if tax authorities challenge certain of NEP's tax positions; NEP's ability to use NOLs to offset future income may be limited; NEP will not have complete control over NEP's tax decisions; A valuation allowance may be required for NEP's deferred tax assets; Distributions to unitholders may be taxable as dividends; Unitholders who are not resident in Canada may be subject to Canadian tax on gains from the sale of common units if NEP's common units derive more than 50% of their value from Canadian real property at any time.

(Michael Nagle/Bloomberg News) As the economy improves, more people are landing jobs and using traditional bank accounts, a new survey shows. The share of consumers who were unbanked fell faster than expected last year to 7 percent, down from 7.7 percent in 2013, according to a new report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. That percentage has been dropping since it peaked at 8.2 percent in 2011 and is now the lowest it has been since the survey was started in 2009. Consumers were defined as being unbanked if no one in their household had a bank account. The FDIC also looked at the underbanked, meaning that someone in the household had a bank account but that the person still turned to nontraditional — and sometimes costly — financial services, such as payday loans, pawn shops or auto title loans. About 1 in 5 consumers said they were underbanked last year, about the same as in 2013. Consumers across income brackets and racial groups became more likely to have bank accounts over the past couple of years. African American households that are unbanked drop to 18.2 percent last year from 20.6 percent in 2013. Among Hispanic households, the rate dropped to 16.2 percent from 17.9 percent. One exception was Asian households, which saw the share of unbanked nearly double to 4 percent in 2015 from 2.2. percent in 2013. Even households with incomes below $15,000 a year, who are typically less likely to have bank accounts, saw their unbanked rate drop “significantly” to 25.6 percent in 2015 from 27.7 percent in 2013. The share of households that are unbanked dropped almost across the board in 2015 from 2013. One exception was Asian households, which saw a slight increase in the unbanked. (Courtesy of the FDIC) It’s unclear exactly why there was such a strong increase in the share of people with bank accounts. The FDIC is still studying the reasons why different groups are more or less likely to be unbanked, Chairman Martin Gruenberg said in prepared remarks. More details will be released with the full report in October. But generally speaking, the decline among the unbanked is partly the result of a more robust economy. One-third of the people who opened bank accounts over the past year said that the move was connected to a new job or because they wanted to have their checks deposited directly into their accounts. “Many households enter and exit the banking system for job-related reasons,” Gruenberg said. People who have lost their jobs or who saw a sudden drop in income are less likely to have a bank account, as are people with unsteady paychecks, the report found. Four percent of households with stable pay that earned between $30,000 and $50,000 a year lacked bank accounts. The share more than doubled to 9.5 percent for households with similar earnings but irregular paychecks, the report found.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 08, 2016 2:05pm   Comments Share: Related EMB EM Bond ETFs Are Still Attractive iShares EM ETFs Are Raking In Cash Emerging Markets React Strongly To Trump Victory (Seeking Alpha) Exchange-traded funds holding emerging market bonds, including the iShares JPMorgan USD Emer Mkt Bnd Fd ETF (NYSE: EMB), have had the wind at their backs this year, as the Federal Reserve has held off on raising interest rates, suppressing the dollar in the process. Contextual Backdrop The case for the dollar-denominated debt held by EMB and rival ETFs is bolstered in the a “lower for longer” environment, because emerging market bonds denominated in dollars have previously proven sensitive to rising Treasury yields. Related Link: A Marvelous Multi-Factor ETF Importantly, there are other factors at play bolstering the case for emerging market bond ETFs that extend beyond tempting yields and the Fed not raising rates. While ETFs such as EMB are often beholden to external factors such as Fed policy and dollar strength, improving domestic fundamentals in some developing economies help matters. Economic Growth And EMB, Peers “Emerging market economic growth managed to hang on to much of its momentum over August according to the latest release of the IHS Markit Emerging Market Composite PMI index. The August reading indicated that emerging market economies stayed in expansion territory for the third month in a row for the first time since the spring of last year,” said Markit in a recent note. “Growth in developed economies, while still in expansion territory, continued to be challenged with the current pace of expansion materially lower than the pace seen at the turn of the year.” Some of EMB's largest country allocations, including the Philippines and Indonesia, show expanding economies. Russia, on the other hand, as the ETF's third-largest geographic weight, is working its way out of its worst post-Soviet era recession. The rush to emerging markets bonds have the asset class sporting equity-like returns this year. Year-to-date, EMB is up 15.3 percent, which trails the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 230 basis points, but the bond ETF has been only a quarter a volatile as the widely followed developing world equity benchmark. Yield Of course, yield is also motivating investors to embrace ETFs like EMB. EMB has a 30-day SEC yield of 4.38 percent, far superior to what investors will find on most developed world sovereigns. That likely explains why EMB has added $4.3 billion in new assets this year, a total exceeded by just two other fixed income ETFs. “Strong returns delivered by sovereign EM bonds has knocked over 110bps off the asset class’ yield ytd, which is nearly twice the tightening seen by US Treasuries bonds over the same period of time. These plunging yields mean that US investors are now receiving 2.9 percent of extra yield by parking their money in dollar denominated EM sovereigns, which is roughly 20bps less than the average extra yield delivered by the trade in the six years since the Markit iBoxx USD Emerging Markets Sovereigns launched in 2010,” added Markit.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 08, 2016 1:14pm   Comments Share: Related LLY 10 Notable Stocks Trading Ex-Dividend Friday, November 11 Biotech Is Getting A Big Boost Following Clinton's Loss Amgen On Track For 2018 Migraine-Drug Launch, Beating 'Crowded Field' (Investor's Business Daily) JPMorgan has upgraded Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE: LLY) to Overweight from Neutral based on the potential for new product driven upside to estimates in 2017 and beyond. The brokerage's bullish thesis also reflects a favorable risk/reward for solanezumab data in Alzheimer patients late this year. Notably, Lilly modified the study to include only a cognitive endpoint (ADAS-Cog14) as its primary endpoint, moving the more challenging function endpoint (ADCS-iADL) to a secondary earlier this year. "While the FDA recommends both cognitive and function endpoints for Alzheimer's drug approvals, we would not be surprised to see a positive cognitive endpoint and a trend towards functional benefit ultimately being sufficient for approval," analyst Chris Schott wrote in a note. Outcomes And Probabilities The analyst sees more than 15 percent upside in the stock if EXP-3 study meets both primary and secondary endpoints, which he states are between a 10–20 percent probability. The analyst expects a more muted 10 percent upside if the study hits on its primary but only shows a trend on secondary endpoints (50–60 percent probability). Further, Schott predicts a 10 percent drop in stock if the study fails both endpoints (about 30 percent probability). Moreover, irrespective of the outcome of solanezumab, Schott sees a diverse range of new product opportunities supporting Eli Lilly's greater than 5 percent top-line growth target. Related Link: Apple, Eli Lilly, U.S. Steel: Fast Money Picks For September 7 The analyst forecast about 6 percent top-line growth through 2020, with about 5 percent excluding risk adjusted solanezumab sales. The analyst's sales growth target is also supported by a number of $1+ billion product opportunities such as Trulicity, Jardiance, Taltz, baricitinib and abemaciclib. "In aggregate, we forecast recent/upcoming new product launches to generate $11.4 billion in sales by 2020," Schott highlighted. Driven by healthy top-line growth, the analyst also projects significant margin expansion over the next several years and predicts margins of about 32 percent by 2020 versus about 22.5 percent estimated in 2016. As a result, Schott anticipates annual EPS growth of about 16 percent though 2020. At time of writing, shares of Lilly rose 1.57 percent to $79.82, while the analyst raised his price target by $3 to $95 (implying 21 percent upside potential over last close).

Moynihan, in an interview with CNBC on Thursday, said he was bullish on the consumer and strong spending is showing up in his company's businesses. "As you look at the month of August, which we just got the final details on, it'll be the strongest consumer spending growth in debit and credit cards year-over-year this year," he said, adding the consumer is "very constructive." show chapters <p>BAC CEO: US consumers in very good shape</p> <p>Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan discusses the state of the U.S. economy, the quality of loans the bank is giving out and the state of the U.S. consumer.</p> BAC CEO: US consumers in very good shape    Thursday, 8 Sep 2016 | 7:40 AM ET | 04:18 "Year-to-date consumers on our debit and credit cards are spending 4.7 percent more than they did last year, and the pace is accelerating. So, the consumer is in very good shape credit-quality-wise, spending-wise," he said. Moynihan's comments on August spending patterns are particularly interesting since auto sales slowed in the month and the ISM manufacturing survey and ISM nonmanufacturing survey were both shockingly weaker than expected for the month. Retail sales, expected next Thursday, are the next really important data for the markets — and the Federal Reserve. Headline retail sales are projected to be flat but up 0.3 percent when auto sales are not counted. Excluding autos, sales fell 0.3 percent in July and were flat on the headline. "Implicit in what he said is the retail sales number could be really good," said Richard Bove, bank analyst at Rafferty Capital. Bove said JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon made a similar comment when his bank's earnings were released last month. "All of them are seeing the consumer using their credit card to a greater degree and spending aggressively. Even in the GDP figures for the second quarter, even though GDP was up a minimal amount, consumer spending was up 4.2 percent," Bove said. Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics, said the consumer is still doing fairly well and seems to have had a good back-to-school shopping season. She said the sales report could be skewed with heavier spending on building materials because of the flooding in Louisiana and a slowdown in car sales. "You can have mixed signals. We know the auto sales are down, and we hope the consumers reallocated their money somewhere else," she said. "There has to be a slowdown from the second quarter, at a pace of 4.2 percent." But both Bove and Swonk point to problems with the way retail sales data are measured by the government, and both say they have been in communication with the Commerce Department which is trying to fix it. Online sales and changes in the way consumers spend are making it very difficult to measure the consumer. "They're not getting all the online sales," said Swonk. July's retail sales report, for instance, was flat but online spending was higher, raising speculation that Amazon.com's one-day shopping holiday, Prime Day, may have snatched more sales away than normal from bricks-and-mortar retailers. Bove said the Commerce Department is trying to change its methodology. "That's the issue that we have in looking at the economy. It's pretty simple to see the industrial economy is very troubled. New orders are down, ISM is bad. Capacity utilization is weak. Capital spending is lower than one would hope. All of the data is being picked up reasonably well. On the consumer side, we don't know whether the methodology in place are correctly picking up what the consumer is doing," he said. Swonk said consumers, about 70 percent of the U.S. economy, are increasing credit card use after the financial crisis dramatically curbed available credit and forced a consumer pullback. She said the consumer is now back to 1995 levels of credit card usage as it relates to GDP. "The important issue is in the consumer credit numbers — the only growth had been in auto loans and student loans. We're finally moving the needle on the credit cards," she said. Swonk said auto sales probably peaked, after consumers loaded up on vehicles and car debt. Sales were weaker in August, with Ford seeing a decline of 8.4 percent in U.S. sales, and GM down 5.2 percent. But the annualized pace of sales was still more than 17 million.

 Inside a Wall Street innovation lab set up to 'reshape the entire work experience' Tina Wadhwa Sep. 8, 2016, 12:33 PM 5,387 facebook linkedin twitter email print Tina Wadhwa Can 5,000 square feet transform a bank?  BNP Paribas clearly hopes so. It opened what it's calling an "innovation zone" Wednesday on the 30th floor of its midtown Manhattan US headquarters. Banking is changing fast, with startups encroaching on the big companies' turf, and new technologies like blockchain, which is decentralized, threatening to take some control away from big banks.  That's why competitors are acquiring startups and launching accelerators. BNP Paribas is hoping this lab will help it stay relevant.  "The goal here is to foster all kinds of innovation and to reshape the entire work experience," said Bruno d'Illiers, COO of BNP Paribas North America. He sees it as a place where employees from different divisions can meet and brainstorm.  "The lab is open to everybody," he said.  BNP Paribas is a big player in international finance worldwide. However, its US presence is a growing, but relatively small part of its business. It has 188,000 employees worldwide, with 16,000 in North America.  Its better-known competitors are racing to acquire or partner with hot fintech startups. JPMorgan teamed up with On Deck Capital, an online lender. UBS' wealth-management arm teamed up with SigFig, a so-called robo-advisor. Another automated investment company, FutureAdvisor, was acquired by BlackRock.  And BNP has watched as other banks like Wells Fargo, Citi and UBS have established their own in-house fintech labs and innovation centers in recent years, complete with the kind of startup-style that's synonymous with Silicon Valley. Tina Wadhwa BNP's is no different. Its kitchen has free drinks and snacks. Its desks and chairs are made of recycled materials. It looks more Brooklyn than big bank.   "I was inspired by how my own kids are working these days," said Cecile  Vilaraseau-Remy, head of transformation and premises at BNP Paribas Americas. There's a bright and airy feel. It's modern, if rather stark.  The employees that do come up to the lab are likely to spend a lot of time thinking about blockchain, the technology behind Bitcoin. It's thought to be a more secure way to send and verify financial transactions, as it eliminates middlemen and ensures everyone involved has an indelible record of money coming and going.  BNP Paribas is an investor in Digital Asset Holdings (DAH), the blockchain startup run by former JPMorgan CFO Blythe Masters. BNP's head of commodities and FX, Catherine Flax, sits on the board and is involved with the startup's efforts to implement blockchain technology to business processes. BNP is also one of forty banks that signed on to R3, the industry wide body trying to bring blockchain technology to finance. To show it's serious, the launch of the innovation lab was combined with what it's calling "America’s Blockchain Bizhackathon," which brought together industry leaders in the blockchain community including the CMO of Digital Asset Holdings, the co-Founder of R3, fintech investors, and a blockchain strategist at Microsoft. Tina Wadhwa More than 200 employees attended the event and some will spend part of this week figuring out how BNP might benefit from implementing blockchain technology. Then the space will open up to all employees.  Others using the space may work on big data, robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence, areas that have only recently started to infiltrate the staid world of banking.  The company is also running what it calls an "Ideation Campaign," which asks employees to submit proposals to improve the bank's business processes.  Innovation labs have a mixed track record. It can be hard to transplant a freewheeling creative spirit into companies with strong hierarchies and an entrenched culture, and some companies end up pulling the plug on the experiments.  Its high ceilings and laptop-friendly wood tables may inspire BNP's employees come up with the ideas that help the company adapt and compete. Or it could just be a place for employees to get a free snack.  NOW WATCH: The real estate tricks billionaires use to sell their penthouses faster and for more money Loading video...

Thanks to an energizing combination of inflows and a supportive technical backdrop, the asset class has delivered a total return of 17.1% as of September 7, according to JP Morgan's GBI-EM Global Diversified index, making it the best performing mainstream credit market this year. In the emerging markets alone, the index has outperformed the EMBI Global Diversified, which measures sovereign dollar bonds, by 250bp. Against the Barclays Global Aggregate index, the return is even more impressive, with an outperformance of close to 700bp. With recent economic data from emerging economies showing signs of improvement - Moody's expects growth for G20 developing countries of 4.4% this year and 5% for 2017 - and valuations for local currency debt attractive, investors have returned to the asset class. "Currencies have adjusted, nominal yields are high, and anything dollar-denominated has become very expensive. All natural conditions are in place for a rotation into local currency," said Alan Cameron, economist at Exotix. Local currency bonds have seen US$11.34bn of net inflows this year, according to EPFR Global, compared with net outflows of US$16.87bn in 2015 and US$12.83bn in 2014, as investors sniff bargains. "Not only have EM currencies depreciated to close to their 20-year lows, but bond yields have also increased to the highest levels since the 2008 crisis, in real as well as nominal terms," said Alexis De Mones, head of fixed income at Ashmore. The average yield on the GBI-EM GD index is 6.17%, while 10-year Treasuries are at 1.54% and 10-year Bunds are negative yielding. "Relative to US real interest rates, yields of emerging markets local bonds on the GBI EM GD currently trade close to all-time highs," De Mones said. ALPHA Still, there are potential risks, not least US rate hikes and FX fluctuations, although investors believe that, given valuations, EM currencies offer a means to add alpha. "Given that currencies generally exhibit mean reverting characteristics, the deviation from the historical average we are seeing now suggests that an exposure to EM currencies could potentially add to the return on EM local bonds," said Olga Yangol, portfolio manager at HSBC Global Asset Management. The outlook for local rates is also constructive. "There is definitely room for EM central banks to cut rates," said Rob Simpson, portfolio manager at Insight Investment. "At the same time, growth is picking up. Russia and Brazil signaled rate hikes but are now in cutting mode." Some fund managers believe the asset class is only at the beginning of a prolonged period of outperformance. "We believe local bonds will deliver strong risk adjusted returns in the medium to long term, and for investors concerned with timing, we're in a particularly strong environment as the asset class currently displays a combination of strong value and momentum," said De Mones. However, as the poor performance between May 2013 and December 2015 shows - triggered by the taper tantrum and continued thanks to the slump in commodity prices - investors can get their fingers' badly burned. Currently South Africa, for example, is proving volatile thanks to political uncertainty. The rand has seen huge fluctuations over the past month, trading in a range of 13.26 to 14.73 against the dollar. It is now at 14.03. "South Africa is an interesting case," said Yangol. "There's been an improvement in the trade balance. If we didn't read the news and just looked at the fundamentals then it would be a key candidate for adding exposure. But it's cheap for a reason."
