John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Nov 14, 2016 at 4:46PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. News that Donald Trump won the presidential election last week has sent bank stocks surging across the board, with the KBW Bank Index up nearly 13% since last Tuesday's close. But even though this performance has been broad-based, few banks stand to gain as much from a Trump presidency as Citigroup (NYSE:C). Short- vs. long-term benefits to Citigroup If you've been following Citigroup's stock performance over the past week, this may surprise you. I say that because shares of the nation's fourth biggest bank by assets are lagging those of its peers. While the KBW Bank Index is up almost 13% since last Tuesday, Citigroup's stock is up only 9%. Before its shareholders get disappointed, though, it's worth pointing out that the New York-based bank is still creaming the broader market, which is up only 1% over the same stretch. KBWB data by YCharts. But just because Citigroup has lagged its big-bank peers since the election results were announced doesn't mean it will continue to underperform them. In fact, I think there are reasons to believe it will more than make up for the difference over the next year. Why Citigroup has so much to gain Over the long run, Citigroup has the most to gain if Trump follows through on his campaign platform. Its shares currently trade for the lowest valuation among blue-chip bank stocks, priced at a 27% discount to book value. Meanwhile, the discount on Bank of America's shares is a more reasonable 18%. And both JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo's shares trade for premiums to their book values -- at 24% and 48%, respectively, according to data from Yahoo! Finance. Additionally, Trump's promise to reduce regulations on the financial industry, and to roll back the Dodd-Frank Act in particular, should be particularly beneficial to Citigroup. Thanks to regulations passed pursuant to Dodd-Frank, the megabank must currently hold more capital relative to its assets than any other bank but JPMorgan Chase. Because this reduces the amount of leverage Citigroup can use relative to its peers, it also means the bank must work even harder than competitors to generate the type of profitability investors expect from a bank its size. Trump hasn't come out and said specifically that he intends to reduce capital requirements on banks, but if you read between the lines, that's essentially what he means when he says banks aren't loaning as much as they otherwise might under a less strict regulatory environment. Finally, if Trump's administration eliminates or dials back the annual stress tests big banks must undergo, this will also be distinctly beneficial to Citigroup. Among other things, the stress tests give regulators the authority to veto big bank capital plans -- i.e., how much they return to shareholders via dividends and stock buybacks. Citigroup has struggled more than most banks to appease regulators in the past on this front, having requests to increase its dividend denied repeatedly over the past six years. The net result is that Citigroup pays out a smaller share of its earnings by way of dividends than any other major bank. Its payout ratio is currently only 6.5%, which is half as much as Bank of America's 16%, and even less than that of JPMorgan and Wells Fargo's plus-30% payout ratios. It remains to be seen whether the stress tests will in fact be affected in this way, but if they are -- and it isn't unreasonable to think they could be -- then Citigroup could scale up its dividend faster and to a greater degree than any other big bank. This would almost certainly stimulate its share price. Thus, even though Citigroup's shares haven't risen as much since the election as they have at Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo, investors in Citigroup should feel confident that it's likely to close the gap as time passes.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Nov 14, 2016 at 2:24PM JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon is allegedly being considered for Treasury Secretary in President-elect Donald Trump's administration. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. Last week's presidential election was the best thing that's happened to bank stocks since well before the financial crisis. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of this trend, with its shares breaching new all-time highs on a daily basis. All told, JPMorgan Chase's stock has climbed 13% since before the presidential election last Tuesday. Today alone, its shares are up nearly 3% halfway through the trading session. JPM data by YCharts. Sentiment for bank stocks is improving The surge in bank stocks since the election is being fueled by President-elect Donald Trump's campaign promises to increase economic growth in the United States. His strategy is to do so through a combination of tax breaks, lower regulation, and higher government spending. Higher government expenditures to improve things like bridges, roads, and airports would serve as a particularly potent economic stimulant. Thanks to British economist John Maynard Keynes, it's been well-known for nearly a century now that the best way to get an ailing economy rapidly growing again is to offset lagging consumer expenditures with higher government spending. Not only would this boost the nation's gross domestic product, or GDP, but it would also almost certainly spur inflation -- both of which are great news for bank stocks, and JPMorgan Chase in particular. A faster growth rate would spur loan demand, which is the most important financial product banks sell. And higher inflation would translate into higher interest rates and thus wider profit margins from the loans that are made. Earlier today, The Wall Street Journal reported that economists have raised their forecasts on both counts. Economists now expect the U.S. economy to grow at 2.2% in 2017 and 2.3% the following year, compared to only about 1.5% over the past 12 months. And they expect inflation to come in at 2.2% next year, which would be the first time the figure has eclipsed the Federal Reserve's 2% threshold since the 2008 crisis. In response to expectations like these, traders sent the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds soaring on Monday. After beginning October at 1.7%, the benchmark long-term rate is now above 2%. 10-Year Treasury rate data by YCharts. Why this is good news for JPMorgan Chase If forecasts like these prove to be accurate, it will very likely lead to a surge in bank profits. In JPMorgan Chase's latest regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the bank estimates that a boost of 100 basis points to short- and long-term rates will translate into an added $2.8 billion in annual net interest income. That's not as big of a game changer for JPMorgan Chase as it is for, say, Bank of America, which would earn twice as much under a similar scenario, but it would still equate to a roughly 12% increase to JPMorgan Chase's profits based off last quarter's figures. It's important to point out as well, that Trump's promise to roll back regulations on the financial sector is likely to have a similarly positive effect on bank earnings. Trump in particular wants to roll back the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that weigh most heavily on the nation's biggest banks -- JPMorgan Chase being the largest of all. If Trump is able to follow through on these promises, it could free up hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of assets on JPMorgan Chase's balance sheet, which could then be deployed more profitably into loans as opposed to low-yielding government securities. Along these same lines, any dilution in financial consumer protection laws, which is also a priority of the Republican party, could spur innovation in the industry and reduce regulatory and compliance costs at banks like JPMorgan Chase. In short, while it remains to be seen how much of Trump's campaign agenda will materialize into actual policies, there's little question that any movement in that direction will be good news for JPMorgan Chase.

Agents arrested Ricardo Hill, 38, last month. A criminal complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan charged him with conspiring to operate an unlicensed bitcoin exchange called Coin.mx. Prosecutors have said that the exchange was masterminded by Gery Shalon, an Israeli accused of orchestrating a massive attack on JPMorgan and other companies, and that it was operated by another Florida man, Anthony Murgio. FBI Special Agent Joel Decapua wrote in the complaint filed against Hill in October that Hill was aware the exchange was being used to launder the loot from ransomware schemes. Hill began working for Coin.mx as a marketing manager and business development coordinator in January 2014. According to the complaint, Hill discussed with the other operators how dealing with ransomware crooks could get them brought up on charges of money laundering. Coin.mx allegedly kept processing payments on behalf of the victims of ransomware schemes, pocketing a 7.5% fee with the transactions, which were likely to be reported as fraudulent. One of the ransomware schemes that lined the pockets of the bitcoin exchange operators was the infamous CryptoLocker: one of the best-known ransomware variants ever released, and one that’s spawned clones such as CryptoWall. Another of its offspring was one that borrowed the CryptoLocker name and then got packaged up with a phishing email about fake speeding fines. According to Hill’s estimates, ransomware victims made up about 40% percent of Coin.mx’s customers, based on the volume of calls he received from them, the complaint said. Sophos Home Stop ransomware with our free personal security software Learn More In November 2015, the Justice Department charged Shalon, Orenstein, and an American named Joshua Samuel Aaron with computer hacking crimes against JPMorgan, as well as other financial institutions, brokerage firms and financial news reporters, including the Wall Street Journal. Aaron was a fugitive until last month, when he turned up at a facility for illegal immigrants outside Moscow. He had failed to show police a valid passport during a midnight check at his apartment, according to court documents seen by Bloomberg. The JPMorgan breach was initially thought to involve the theft of as many as 83 million customer records. Altogether, the trio has been accused of ripping off the data of more than 100 million customers from JPMorgan and other companies, and then using it in schemes such as stock manipulation that generated hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit gains. Hill was released on $75,000 bond on Thursday. Pending his trial, the court also barred him from going on to money exchanges via the internet.

In recent years, bank stocks have been held back by heavy regulation and historically low interest rates which have sapped the earnings potential of their massive cash holdings. But optimism about the sector’s outlook is growing. Interest rates are rising and investors are betting that Trump will follow through on his campaign promise to review the increased number of regulations put on the banking system after it nearly keeled over in the 2008 financial crisis. The S&P 500 bank subsector rose 10.2 per cent in the three days following Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. This was the index’s best three-day performance since August 2009. In those three days, Wells Fargo Co shares rose 13.6 per cent, JPMorgan Chase & Co climbed 9.5 per cent and Bank of America gained 11.9 per cent. Some investors and analysts watching banks say the stocks are likely not near the end of their run. “They are not close to being expensive yet,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. The S&P 500 banks are currently trading at about 11.2 times forward earnings estimates as a group, up from about nine times in February, when the index hit its lowest since May 2013. Valuation is still well off peak levels of over 33 times earnings estimates in May of 2009, though it trades near levels seen between 2002 and 2008, before many current regulations were put in place. If rates continue to rise and the Trump administration gives some clarity on how regulations will change, then bank valuations “certainly can move higher,” Piper Jaffray analyst Kevin Baker said. Baker stopped short of giving a specific P/E estimate but he pointed to the higher valuations of banks that are not designated as systemically important financial institutions, commonly referred to as “too big to fail”. Today, the minimum asset threshold for too-big-to-fail designated banks is US$50 billion (RM219.5 billion). If this threshold is lifted to US$250 billion in a regulatory overhaul it would give a lot more flexibility that could likely boost valuations of banks operating in that range, Baker said. Valuations for too-big-to-fail designated banks are at around 12.5 times forward earnings compared with multiples of 13 to 15 for banks outside of this category, according to Baker. Ed Keon, managing director and portfolio manager of QMA, a multi-asset manager owned by Prudential Financial, said he has been buying into the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, the ETF that tracks the S&P financial sector, in the last couple of weeks. He is betting on higher interest rates and a pick-up in economic growth. The potential for lighter regulation added to his enthusiasm for the sector. “Of course, no one yet knows exactly what policy changes will occur and exactly how much they will help profits, but I think the benefit might be solid enough that I am maintaining my overweight holdings in the sector,” Keon said. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Nepal PM phones India’s Modi over rupee chaos Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites European equities drift higher United to delay taking Boeing jets in US$4.8b savings push Snapchat files for one of the biggest tech IPOs in years, sources say Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter Most Watched Now Week An in-depth look at Mazda’s SKYACTIV-G engine Reuters Video: Groin-flashing frog discovered in Australia Reuters Video: Supermoon dazzles in Havana Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Related Articles Wall Street week ahead eyes Alphabet possibly toppling Apple from its perch Jobs report may test Wall St complacency Don’t leave small-cap stocks for dead Wall Street week ahead: Spring fever brings hope for US earnings Stocks face earnings blues after tech slide Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Music News Entertainment Politics Features Share < br />this article: Report: Former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin frontrunner for secretary of treasury In Politics by Jamie Peck / November 14, 2016 Share < br />this article: Follow @jamie_elizabeth Last week, there was some speculation that Donald Trump meant to ask JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon to be the U.S. Treasury Secretary, despite the fact that he didn’t want the job. Now Bloomberg News reports that former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner Steven Mnuchin is the transition team’s top pick, as had been earlier speculated. Bloomberg News reports that two sources “familiar with the process” say the prominent capitalist is the transition team’s top pick for the job. This would make sense, as Mnuchin threw in with Trump early and helped him raise millions of dollars as finance chairman of his campaign. After amassing a fortune of over $40 million via his position at Goldman Sachs, he left the investment banking firm and took his money to Hollywood, where he has produced big budget films like “Suicide Squad” and the “X-Men” franchise. Assuming Mnuchin gets the job, his appointment will represent one more departure from Trump’s populist rhetoric. While Trump gained middle class support by pledging to take on Wall Street and the political establishment, it doesn’t get much more establishment than Mnuchin, who would be the third ex-Goldman executive to fill the post since the mid-1990s (one under Clinton, and one under Bush II). As Bloomberg points out, his resume reads like a parody of everything Trump voters hate, right down to his involvement in the 2009 foreclosure crisis Via Bloomberg: Before joining Trump, Mnuchin rose through the kind of elite institutions the president-elect spent his campaign vilifying. Mnuchin was tapped into Yale’s Skull and Bones secret society, became a Goldman Sachs partner like his father before him, ran a hedge fund, worked with George Soros, funded Hollywood blockbusters and bought a failed bank, IndyMac, with billionaires including John Paulson. They renamed it OneWest, drew protests for foreclosing on U.S. borrowers, and ultimately generated considerable profits, selling the business last year to CIT Group Inc. for $3.4 billion. On the upside, he’s probably no worse than Hillary Clinton’s secretary of the treasury would have been, which is more than we can say of some Trump appointments.

You might need to take a pill to figure out if you'll be hit with a surprise ATM fee even if you're a customer of this huge bank. Customers using Chase ATMs at Walgreens and Duane Reade locations could be getting new notifications that they'll have to pay a surcharge if they try to withdraw their own cash from the machines. In April, Cardtronics announced it bought 2,586 ATMs from Chase, primarily in Walgreens and Duane Reades, as well at several airports and other retail locations across the U.S. Pat Kiernan, a weekday morning anchor for local cable television news channel NY1 and a Chase customer, was using a Chase ATM at the Duane Reade inside Penn Station in New York City on Monday morning. He was about to withdraw cash from the machine , but stopped when he saw a notification on the screen saying he would incur a $3 surcharge imposed by Cardtronics. Previously, Chase customers such as Kiernan were exempt from such fees at stand-alone Chase ATMs in such locations. "I don't understand how hard it is to take the sign off the ATM before you change the software," Kiernan told CNBC. @patkiernan: Bad enough that @Chase sold off its convenient Duane Reade ATMs. Beware - they're off Chase network but still have Chase signs. #surcharge Penn Station is the busiest railway station in North America, serving 1,000 passengers every 90 seconds, according to Railway Technology. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said the station served more than 50 million riders in 2015. It's the busiest station in the Amtrak system, serving more than 10 million passengers a year. It is also the busiest New Jersey Transit station, accommodating more than 92,000 average weekday boardings. Weeks ago, Chase's customer service team said via Twitter that "if it has the Chase logo on or around the ATM, then it is a Chase ATM." @Chase ATM in Duane Reade now says Cardtronics. Will I be charged fee if I use it? 99% of my w/draws are at DRs, branches r inconvenient @AlykatAlyssa If it has the Chase logo on or around the ATM, then it is a Chase ATM. ^WP Chase spokesman Mike Fusco, when contacted about Kiernan's situation, told CNBC he would look into why the screens on Chase ATMs reflected Cardtronics ownership while the Chase logo and signage remained. "From now until early next year, we've been notifying customers on the screens that the machine will no longer be a Chase ATM," Fusco said. "But as long as the Chase brand remains on the screen, it will remain free for customers." Photo: Pat Kiernan A Chase-branded ATM that says it will charge Chase customers a fee for using Fusco later followed up with an email to CNBC that said the "message" on the ATM screen that Kiernan saw "is incorrect." "And we are working with Cardtronics to fix the issue," Fusco said. "We have confirmed that Chase customers are not being charged and we will continue to monitor." A Cardtronics spokesman told CNBC the company has been integrating locations into its ATM fleet since its announcement in April announcement. He said the company "expects to have news on the topic of ATM branding later this year." — CNBC's Dan Mangan contributed to this report.

E.S.T. Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story BEIJING — Asian stocks were mostly lower Tuesday as expectations of a U.S. rate hike boosted the dollar and investors watched President-elect Donald Trump for signs of policy direction. KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2 percent to 3,204.31 points and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 was flat at 17,670.77. Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 tumbled 0.5 percent to 5,320.60 and Seoul's Kospi was almost unchanged at 1,974.27. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.4 percent to 22,314.62. Benchmarks in Southeast Asia and New Zealand were mixed. WALL STREET: Tech companies including Apple and Microsoft took big losses on concern Trump's policies might hurt their sales in China and other global markets. Bank stocks surged as bond yields rose, which allows them to make more money from lending. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. RISING DOLLAR: The dollar climbed as high as 108.30 yen from Monday's 107.87 yen as expectations of a U.S. rate hike rose. Trump's surprise election initially raised expectations the Federal Reserve might put off a rate hike until his plans were clear. But analysts say the latest comments from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan indicate the Fed is sticking to plans to act in December. "There appears no stopping the U.S. dollar's recent ascent based on the current interest rate trajectory," Stephen Innes of OANDA said in a report. TRUMP WATCH: Investors were watching for signs of what Trump, who gave few details of his plans on the campaign trail, might do in office. Analysts say his promises of tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending could boost economic growth but also spur inflation. His threats of sanctions against China and other trading partners that he accuses of acting unfairly have rattled trade-dependent Asian economies. ANALYST'S TAKE: "Moving forward, the spotlight could shine on the contentious trade policy proposals that the president-elect had raised during his campaign," said Jingyi Pan of IG in a report. "The latest soundbite from outgoing President Barack Obama seems to suggest that the incoming president is 'ultimately pragmatic'," said Pan. "It is without a doubt that emerging Asian markets would be negatively impacted should a trade war break out between US and China, although the delayed address could mean that the President-elect may indeed be more pragmatic than we have known."

ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gained 89 cents to $44.21 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract shed 9 cents on Monday to close at $43.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 75 cents to $45.19 in London. It lost 32 cents on Monday to $44.43. Continue reading the main story We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. RISING DOLLAR: The dollar climbed as high as 108.30 yen from Monday's 107.87 yen as expectations of a U.S. rate hike rose. Trump's surprise election initially raised expectations the Federal Reserve might put off a rate hike until his plans were clear. But analysts say the latest comments from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan indicate the Fed is sticking to plans to act in December. "There appears no stopping the U.S. dollar's recent ascent based on the current interest rate trajectory," Stephen Innes of OANDA said in a report. TRUMP WATCH: Investors were watching for signs of what Trump, who gave few details of his plans on the campaign trail, might do in office. Analysts say his promises of tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending could boost economic growth but also spur inflation. His threats of sanctions against China and other trading partners that he accuses of acting unfairly have rattled trade-dependent Asian economies. ANALYST'S TAKE: "Moving forward, the spotlight could shine on the contentious trade policy proposals that the president-elect had raised during his campaign," said Jingyi Pan of IG in a report. "The latest soundbite from outgoing President Barack Obama seems to suggest that the incoming president is 'ultimately pragmatic'," said Pan. "It is without a doubt that emerging Asian markets would be negatively impacted should a trade war break out between US and China, although the delayed address could mean that the President-elect may indeed be more pragmatic than we have known." CURRENCY: The euro was little-changed at $1.0752. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gained 89 cents to $44.21 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract shed 9 cents on Monday to close at $43.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 75 cents to $45.19 in London. It lost 32 cents on Monday to $44.43. 0 Shares Email Star Comments Asian Stocks Meander as Dollar Gains, Markets Watch Trump " Giuliani Could Be Next Secretary of State " Trump Receives 1st Presidential Daily Brief " Report Warns of Asia Arms Race if Trump Withdraws US Forces " West Virginia Mayor Resigns After Controversial Post About Michelle Obama " Why Trump's Appointment of Steve Bannon Has Raised Alarms " Hundreds Hospitalized Due to Wildfires in Southeast " Airline Worker Dead in Oklahoma Airport Shooting " Google, Facebook Move to Block Fake News From Ad Services " Trump Will Change Views on Climate Change: UN Secretary General " 5 Takeaways From Donald Trump's '60 Minutes' Interview " GOP Lawmakers Struggle to Respond as Democrats Denounce Bannon Hire " Trump Tells Putin He Wants 'Strong' Relationship With Russia " Could Trump Really Dismantle the Iran Nuke Deal?

The rally in global markets since the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president was showing signs of running out of steam Monday, Nov. 14, 2016, as bond investors fretted over the inflationary impact of his policies. That rise in U.S. bond yields saw the dollar notch up some further solid gains, though. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig, File) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • Bank stocks are climbing Monday morning as bond yields continue to rise. Bond yields are climbing to their highest levels this year, which points to higher interest rates and bigger profits for banks from lending money. Investors have been selling bonds, pushing yields higher, as they expect the spending plans of president-elect Donald Trump to lead to higher inflation. The big moves for financial firms are pulling the broader stock market higher. Investors are selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. The dollar is also rising. VIDEOS TOP JOBS KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average rose 79 points, or 0.4 percent, to 18,926 as of 8:20 a.m. Mountain time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 6 points, or 0.3 percent, to 2,170. The Nasdaq composite added 3 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,240. BANK BONANZA: Bank stocks continued to surge. They're rising in part because of the big jump in bond yields since the election. Investors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. Trump's election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Bank of America rose 98 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $20 and JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.96 percent, or 3.9 percent, to $79.65. DOING DEALS: South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes products for connected cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.08, or 25.2 percent, to $109.73. MENTORING: German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor's stock rose $5.67, or 18.5 percent, to $36.35. DIG IT: Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.83, or 14.8 percent, to $13.38 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it's too low. Belden stock added $1.88, or 2.7 percent, to $71.58. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.25 percent. Bond trading was closed Friday for the U.S. Veterans' Day holiday. The 10-year yield, which is a benchmark for interest rates on home mortgages and other kinds of loans, finished at 2.06 percent on Thursday. The day before the Nov. 8 presidential election the yield was 1.83 percent. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose sharply against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.41 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0714 from $1.0845. LAGGARDS: Stocks that pay large dividends, like phone and utility companies and real estate investment trusts, all traded lower. Those stocks are most appealing to investors when bond yields are low. American Tower fell $4.64, or 4.4 percent, to $101.07 and NextEra Energy lost $2.42, or 2.1 percent, to $111.12. TRUMP FACTOR: Stocks went into a long skid as the presidential campaign came to its conclusion, but in the last few days stocks have risen as investors hope a Trump presidency will mean cutbacks in regulations that affect energy and banks, among other businesses. The Dow has reached record highs, with the biggest recent gains going to financial firms Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, machinery maker Caterpillar and drug company Merck. ENERGY: With the dollar gaining strength, benchmark U.S. crude fell 59 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $42.82 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 55 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $44.20 a barrel in London. OVERSEAS: France's CAC 40 was up 0.4 percent and Germany's DAX rose 0.3 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 0.3 percent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 percent after a strong reading on Japan's economic growth. The dollar has been particularly strong against the Japanese yen lately and that's helped the country's exporters. Most other Asian markets fell. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent.   Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY VIEW PHOTO GALLERY JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES LDS Church 'retires' Mormon apostle's 'little factory' pamphlet Police: Multiple stabbings at Mountain View High School, suspect in custody Critics cringe at Trump strategist Bannon's ties to alt-right, rhetoric targeting Mormons Audit: Utah athletics can improve financial, hiring and inventory practices Rolly: Utah girl shunned by some in Mormon ward.

KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2 percent to 3,204.31 points and Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 was flat at 17,670.77. Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 tumbled 0.5 percent to 5,320.60 and Seoul’s Kospi was almost unchanged at 1,974.27. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.4 percent to 22,314.62. Benchmarks in Southeast Asia and New Zealand were mixed. WALL STREET: Tech companies including Apple and Microsoft took big losses on concern Trump’s policies might hurt their sales in China and other global markets. Bank stocks surged as bond yields rose, which allows them to make more money from lending. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks came back from an early loss and finished almost unchanged Monday. Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week's election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump's policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. "The market is sniffing out the belief that some of these Trump policies may drive some better economic growth but also may in fact be somewhat inflationary," said PNC Chief Investment Strategist Bill Stone. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple gave up $2.72, or 2.5 percent, to $105.71 while Facebook declined $3.94, or 3.3 percent, to $115.08 and Microsoft slid 90 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $58.12. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $18.53, or 2.4 percent, to $753.22. Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump's spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 2.25 percent from 2.14 percent late Thursday. Bond trading was closed Friday for the Veterans' Day holiday. The day before the Nov. 8 election, the yield was 1.83 percent. That's a huge move for that benchmark rate. Goldman Sachs rose $5.24 percent, to 2.6 percent, to $209.18 and Bank of America rose $1.06, or 5.6 percent, to $20.08. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.82, or 3.7 percent, to $79.51. Stone said investors are focused on potential corporate and individual tax cuts, a "wave of deregulation" that eliminates some of the rules governing businesses like energy companies and banks, and more protectionism on trade, which could hurt sales for companies that do a lot of business overseas. Investors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. For example, Trump's election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Stone added that corporate dealmaking could increase if Trump's administration takes a looser approach to antitrust regulation. Several companies announced deals or deal offers Monday. South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes electronics for cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.07, or 25.2 percent, to $109.72. German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor's stock rose $5.61, or 18.3 percent, to $36.29. Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.75, or 15 percent, to $13.40 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it's too low. Belden stock added $1.52, or 2.2 percent, to $71.22. The dollar rose against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.51 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0726 from $1.0845. Investors are also selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. Verizon fell 51 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.18 and American Electric Power lost $1.27, or 2.1 percent, to $58.72.

Ben Wilmot The Australian 12:00AM November 15, 2016 Save Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on email Share more... Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Whatsapp Print this articleX Ben Wilmot Commercial property reporter Sydney The heavyweight JPMorgan Asset Management has tied up the purchase of the St Collins Lane fashion and dining precinct in Melbourne for $247 million in its second big-ticket purchase in the city. The group bought a Southbank office bank tower for $286m in August, and buying the retail complex from the LaSalle Asia Opportunity Fund III will help put it on the map as a major buyer in the sector. The investment arm of the US bank was a contender for Sydney’s MidCity Centre and is chasing more large assets, both for mandates it holds and its own diversified fund. The deal also rounds out LaSalle’s exit from the property it bought five years ago from the then listed Thakral Holdings and has since dramatically overhauled. The firm’s LaSalle Asian Opportunity Fund III bought Collins Street mall, previously called Australia on Collins, and the associated hotel for $204m. The Singapore-listed Frasers Hospitality Trust in September bought the Novotel Melbourne on Collins, which sits above the retail centre, from LaSalle for $237m. The sales will see LaSalle reap $484m in total. The sale of the retail complex was struck on a fully leased yield of about 5 per cent, in keeping with the re-rating of city retail assets. With regional malls so tightly held, investors have turned to CBD properties at a time when international retailers are also seeking up-market spaces in major capitals. Heavyweight owners, including Vicinity Centres, Sinagpore’s GIC Real Estate, Stockland, ISPT and Dexus Property Group have developed or are developing city holdings to capitalise on the trend. St Collins Lane sits in the heart of Melbourne’s Collins Street and spans more than 9000sq m of gross lettable area across four floors, plus a mezzanine level, comprising more than 60 stores. The retail centre won pre-commitments from a host of international brands including Coach, TAG Heuer, Reiss, Maje, Sandro Paris, Voltaire and The Kooples, along with local brands and restaurants. British retailer Debenhams will also open its first store in St Collins Lane, further lifting the tenancy mix. The retail sale was negotiated by JLL’s Simon Rooney. “The revitalisation of the CBD retail core has driven further strengthening of investor demand for these high quality assets and this was reflected in the competitive sale process for St Collins Lane,” Mr Rooney said. He said this year had seen a record number of CBD retail transactions with $1.6bn to date, eclipsing the $1.2bn last year, as investors chased assets with growth potential. Offshore groups fuelled stiff bidding for St Collins Lane. They have a lower cost of capital and prefer CBD retail assets. “Although offshore investors have moved into other retail categories in recent years — primarily subregional retail — CBD assets remain the top preference for groups with a core strategy,” Mr Rooney said.

News Stocks Technology Healthcare Politics World Videos The Tape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsHow to Play the Stock Market Under President Trump How to Play the Stock Market Under President Trump It’s a rare event when one of Wall Street's most accurate forecasters says the U.S. stock market is poised to go higher. November 14, 2016 WSP The massive stock market rally following Donald Trump’s stunning win and the Republican sweep of the Congress that briefly carried The Dow Jones to its biggest jump since Dec. 2011 and to a record high of 18,855, still has more to go on the upside despite Friday’s retracement. “We think [the markets] can go a bit higher from here,” JPMorgan’s (NYSE:JPM) Marko Kolanovic told CNBC’s “Fast Money” this week. Kolanovic, seen as one of Wall Street’s most accurate forecasters, predicts that Trump’s policies, which would include more fiscal spending and a cut in corporate and personal income taxes, which by the way is bullish for stocks as it will boost growth prospects, would be great for equities—at least in the short-term. “This would be reflationary in nature,” he said. JPMorgan, which has a 2,100 year-end price target for the S&P 500, implying the index will decline by nearly 3% by the end of the year, says the S&P, which is currently trading at 2,164.45 points, or only within 2% of a record price, could surge to 2,300, or 6.3% from current levels in early fiscal 2017. However, Kolanovic acknowledged the risks that some of Trump’s policies like his protectionist agenda when it comes to trade by threatening to slap a 45% tariff on Chinese imports, declare China a currency manipulator on his first day in office, or tax imports from Mexico, pose to the markets. If Trump were to pursue these policies, they might spark a global trade war, “which could easily trigger a global recession,” Citigroup’s Willem Buiter wrote in a note to clients. “There are still uncertainties,” noted JPMorgan’s Kolanovic. “We do think that should keep realized volatility over the market a bit elevated. There are going to be things the market is going to be surprised” about,” he said. “I wouldn’t necessarily shun all safe-haven assets.” Previous article Next article Be the first to comment Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

 Donald Trump's win looks like good news for Wall Street — and bank stocks are flying high Portia Crowe Nov. 10, 2016, 2:56 PM 3,257 facebook linkedin twitter email print Stuart C. Wilson / Stringer / Getty Images US bank stocks were climbing for a second straight day Thursday following president-elect Donald Trump's electoral win. Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo all ended the day in the green Thursday. Most were up by about 4%, while Wells Fargo closed up 7.4%. One major reason for the jump appears to be because Trump is expected to reduce regulation hampering bank profitability. His win could also lead to increased inflation pressures, indicating that the Federal Reserve could begin increasing its rate of interest rate hikes. Trading desks could also benefit from increased market volatility. There are, of course, some risks for the financial industry on the horizon, as KBW's Frederick Cannon and Brian Gardner highlighted in a recent note. Those include a US retrenchment from the global economy and trade agreements. Regional banks could perform better than the universal banks in the long-term because of the larger banks' international exposure. Citigroup, Bank of America, and JPMorgan, for example, have larger international lending portfolios and could be hurt by isolationism, the analysts wrote. Citigroup in particular is at risk from its large exposure to Mexico and other emerging markets, wrote KBW's Brian Kleinhanzl, noting that Citi generates 40% of its revenue from emerging markets. But, as the analysts point out, the near-term benefits appear clearer and more immediate than the risks. Reduced regulation? On the regulatory front, the market appears to be pricing in the fact that Trump's administration will introduce laxer rules. Trump has said he would "dismantle" the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, for example, and "massively" cut back on other regulation. He has also said that he disagrees with breaking up the big banks, according to Barclays' Jason Goldberg. This would be good news for banks. That said, neither KBW's nor Barclay's analysts believe the Dodd-Frank Act will ultimately be repealed. Barclays' Goldberg also does not believe that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will be dismantled, as has also been suggested. The analysts over at Fitch wrote in a note Thursday that the elimination of the CFPB, if it were to happen, would be "unlikely to have a material impact for banks in the aggregate," noting that there has been little talk of repealing the Volcker Rule, specifically. Economic growth? For Goldberg, the main reason Trump's win could be a boon for the banks is if he has a positive impact on GDP growth. "While it's unclear the ultimate impact the new administration will have on GDP growth, it bears watching closely," Goldberg wrote. "Factors that could influence growth either way include increased infrastructure spending, reduced taxes, a potentially larger federal deficit, possibly higher interest rates/inflation and reduced global trade." And from Fitch: "Generally, US financial institutions' performance tends to be correlated with the overall US macroeconomic environment, particularly as it relates to economic growth. Judging by the campaign, the new administration's economic policy is likely to revolve around tax cuts, renegotiating trade agreements, de-regulation and higher infrastructure spending." Of course, there's a big "if" here. As Fitch's analysts wrote, "it remains to be seen the degree to which Trump will implement or be able to carry out his policy initiatives and the long-term effect policy changes will have on growth."

Ken Sweet Leave a comment 26 reads THASUNDA DUCKETT             NEW YORK (AP)— Thasunda Duckett became the CEO of JPMorgan Chase’s consumer banking division in late September, becoming the first African American to hold that job at the nation’s largest bank by assets. Duckett, a mother of four, spoke to The Associated Press about how she started her career and what role she tries to fill as a mentor and how she tries to balance work and personal life in her new job. Q: How’d you get your start in banking? I got into banking through a program called Inroads. It’s a program that prepares minorities for corporate and community leadership. Honestly, when I think about where I am today, I would say that being a part of Inroads was and still is one of the most impactful professional moments in my life. If you talk to successful minorities, specifically African Americans, you’ll be surprised how many are Inroads alums. It really is a special program. My career started at Fannie Mae, which Inroads helped me get. I grew up in the company and really believed in the mission of making home ownership affordable and accessible but I wanted to be closer to the customer. I joined JPMorgan in 2004 doing a lot of work around affordable lending and minority home ownership programs. Q: As an African American woman, what advice would you give to young women, particularly young African American women, who are just starting their careers? For me, I understand that I am on the shoulders of giants. To whom much is given, much is required. It is humbling to be in the position I’m in. But I go back to things that my parents instilled in me when I was younger: I knew there is no challenge I can’t overcome. I want everyone to be proud of themselves. I think it’s beautiful to be me, to be a woman, to be Black, to be born in New York and raised in Texas because that is who I am. I tell women or other minorities to be confident in who you are and know that you do belong. I also tell a lot of the people I speak to: don’t own someone else’s bias and negativity. Don’t subscribe to that. That’s not who you are. Q: What does your typical day look like? There is no typical day, but I would say one of my constants is I work hard to make sure I see my kids before I leave in the morning. One of my special mommy moments, if you will, is my daughter Madison will make my coffee and she will write me a little note on my coffee for me to read on my way to work on the train. That is really special to me. At work, my days are like any other executive. But I try to talk to as many employees as possible to know the business from all levels. When I was made CEO of Auto, one of the first things I did was meet with the guys in the mailroom. I don’t think they’ve ever had a CEO in the mailroom. The reason why I did that is, one, to say thank you and help them understand the role that they play in delivering customer experience. If a customer puts the wrong address on an envelope and it doesn’t post on time that creates a bad customer experience. I wanted them to know how important their job was. I do also spend a lot of time mentoring people. People that want to see how great of a company this is and what type of career mobility there is here. Q: You recently created a charity. Can you tell us about it? It’s called the Otis and Rosie Brown Foundation, named after my parents. What we do is we give scholarships based on character and often seed local organizations or individuals that are making an impact. Think about those unsung heroes in our community and to be able to shine that light on them and say “thank you.’’ The website is extraordinaryis.org.   Like us at https://www.facebook.com/pages/New-Pittsburgh-Courier/143866755628836?ref=hl Follow @NewPghCourier on Twitter  https://twitter.com/NewPghCourier     Also On New Pittsburgh Courier: Red Carpet Rundown: 2016 Oscars 22 photos Launch gallery Red Carpet Rundown: 2016 Oscars 1.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Who thinks President-Elect Trump will be good for U.S. stocks? Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and the JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist known as 'Gandalf,' to name one high-profile pair. A Goldman team led by Equity Strategist Benjamin Snider highlighted the potential for corporate tax reform as a major tailwind for the financial performance of Corporate America. “Each percentage point change in the effective U.S. corporate tax rate is worth about $1.50 of 2017 S&P 500 earnings per share [EPS],” the team writes. “A change in the effective tax rate to 20 percent from the current 26 percent would boost our EPS forecast by 8 percent to $125." This would represent year-over-year growth of 20 percent, or double their current expectation. Appetite for U.S. stocks has been immense since the election. Two-day inflows into the SPDR S&P 500 exchange traded fund, the largest ETF by assets, hit their highest level in over a year on Thursday. After slumping as the election results started to roll in, the front-month S&P 500 futures contract jumped nearly 7 percent from trough to peak on Wednesday. Another benefit to U.S. stocks that Goldman sees is an increase in buybacks, also linked to changing tax policy under Trump. Historically, when there is a repatriation tax holiday like the one Trump discussed on the campaign trail, firms have used cash brought back from oversees for share repurchases, which has been a huge source of net demand for stocks throughout this bull market. JPM Global Head of Quantitative and Derivatives Strategy Marko Kolanovic, meanwhile, has long disagreed with the overwhelming consensus that a Trump victory would be negative for markets. But the extent of investor enthusiasm since the election has caught the strategist off guard. "The previously quoted (though often overblown) risks of Trump's presidency are now likely higher, not lower," writes Kolanovic, who was likened to the Lord of the Rings wizard after his prescient calls on related to the Chinese devaluation of 2015. "While we think that Trump’s win is medium-term positive for equities, we are not fully out of the woods yet."  At this point, the markets appear to have been more fixated on the aspects of a Trump presidency that could be positive for growth, like new infrastructure spending and tax reform, than the potentially detrimental aspects, like limits on immigration and trade protectionism. "As we advocated in our previously published research: emerging market assets, Commodities, Gold and Value stocks should outperform, and USD, Bond proxies and Quality should underperform," writes Kolanovic. "This long term trend, which is reinforced by Trump’s win, is ‘cautiously optimistic reflation,' rather than a ‘full risk on’ and ‘hawkish Fed’ trade." Goldman's team added that the bond market selloff could limit the extent to which stocks rise due to the regime change. “Historically low rates lifted U.S. equity valuations to near-record highs, and if risk-free rates continue to rise they may result in lower equity valuations,” concludes Snider.   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.

After choppy trading late in the session, the Dow ended at a record high while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite dipped. “I think all we're doing is trimming our sails a little from the violently positive rally we had post-election results last week,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has been under pressure since the November 8 election as investors poured money into sectors such as financials, industrials and energy, which are seen benefiting from President-elect Donald Trump's policies. The financial index rose 2.3 per cent, with banks including Bank of America JPMorgan providing the biggest boost. The index has risen 10.8 per cent since the election on hopes of deregulation and higher interest rates. While the financial rally gained steam, the S&P technology index closed down 1.7 per cent, leading the decliners. The index has fallen 3 per cent since the election. Apple fell 2.5 per cent and weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, followed by Facebook and Microsoft. Since technology valuations have soared in recent years, investors are switching money to sectors such as banks, which has been relatively cheaper but should now benefit from rising interest rates, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Investors have been betting technology will look relatively less attractive if Trump lives up to his promise to review regulation in healthcare and financial sectors and to increase government spending on infrastructure to boost economic growth. “If growth becomes more even and available, we may see a continuation of rotation into lower-valuation, more cyclical businesses and out of high-valuation growth stocks like technology,” said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.03 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 18,868.69, the S&P 500 lost 0.25 points, or 0.01 per cent, to 2,164.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.72 points, or 0.36 per cent, to 5,218.40. The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting, with traders pricing in a 91-per cent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The industrial index finished up 0.4 per cent, buoyed by prospects for increased infrastructure outlays. Harman International rose 25.2 per cent to US$109.72 (RM476.31) after Samsung Electronics announced an $8 billion deal to buy the company.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    U.S. stocks came back from an early loss and finished almost unchanged Monday. Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week's election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump's policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. "The market is sniffing out the belief that some of these Trump policies may drive some better economic growth but also may in fact be somewhat inflationary," said PNC Chief Investment Strategist Bill Stone. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple gave up $2.72, or 2.5 percent, to $105.71 while Facebook declined $3.94, or 3.3 percent, to $115.08 and Microsoft slid 90 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $58.12. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $18.53, or 2.4 percent, to $753.22. Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump's spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 2.25 percent from 2.14 percent late Thursday. Bond trading was closed Friday for the Veterans' Day holiday. The day before the Nov. 8 election, the yield was 1.83 percent. That's a huge move for that benchmark rate. Goldman Sachs rose $5.24 percent, to 2.6 percent, to $209.18 and Bank of America rose $1.06, or 5.6 percent, to $20.08. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.82, or 3.7 percent, to $79.51. Stone said investors are focused on potential corporate and individual tax cuts, a "wave of deregulation" that eliminates some of the rules governing businesses like energy companies and banks, and more protectionism on trade, which could hurt sales for companies that do a lot of business overseas. Investors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. For example, Trump's election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Stone added that corporate dealmaking could increase if Trump's administration takes a looser approach to antitrust regulation. Several companies announced deals or deal offers Monday. South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes electronics for cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.07, or 25.2 percent, to $109.72. German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor's stock rose $5.61, or 18.3 percent, to $36.29. Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.75, or 15 percent, to $13.40 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it's too low. Belden stock added $1.52, or 2.2 percent, to $71.22. The dollar rose against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.51 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0726 from $1.0845. Investors are also selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. Verizon fell 51 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.18 and American Electric Power lost $1.27, or 2.1 percent, to $58.72. Oil prices bounced back from a big loss early on. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped just 9 cents to $43.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 32 cents to $44.43 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.28 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 13 cents, or 5 percent, to $2.75 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $2.60 to $1,221.70 an ounce. Silver lost 49 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $16.89 an ounce. Copper picked up 1 cent to $2.52 a pound. France's CAC 40 rose 0.4 percent and Germany's DAX added 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed 0.3 percent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 percent after a strong reading on Japan's economic growth. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent. © Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has been under pressure since the Nov. 8 election as investors poured money into sectors such as financials, industrials and energy, which are seen benefiting from President-elect Donald Trump's policies.The financial index rose 2.3 percent, with banks including Bank of America JPMorgan providing the biggest boost. The index has risen 10.8 percent since the election on hopes of deregulation and higher interest rates. While the financial rally gained steam, the S&P technology index closed down 1.7 percent, leading the decliners. The index has fallen 3 percent since the election. Apple fell 2.5 percent and weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, followed by Facebook and Microsoft. Since technology valuations have soared in recent years, investors are switching money to sectors such as banks, which has been relatively cheaper but should now benefit from rising interest rates, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.Investors have been betting technology will look relatively less attractive if Trump lives up to his promise to review regulation in healthcare and financial sectors and to increase government spending on infrastructure to boost economic growth. "If growth becomes more even and available, we may see a continuation of rotation into lower-valuation, more cyclical businesses and out of high-valuation growth stocks like technology," said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.03 points, or 0.11 percent, to 18,868.69, the S&P 500 lost 0.25 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,164.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.72 points, or 0.36 percent, to 5,218.40.The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting, with traders pricing in a 91-percent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.The industrial index finished up 0.4 percent, buoyed by prospects for increased infrastructure outlays.

  Home U.K. News Sports U.S. Showbiz Australia Femail Health Science Money Video Travel Columnists Wires Home My Profile Logout Login Feedback DailyMail NEW ARTICLESHomeTop Share show ad US STOCKS-Wall St ends flat as financials' rise offsets tech drop By Reuters Published: 16:39 EST, 14 November 2016 | Updated: 16:39 EST, 14 November 2016 e-mail By Sinead Carew Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed little changed on Monday after rising dramatically the week before and a decline in the technology sector offset a steep rise in financial stocks as investors bet on higher interest rates. After choppy trading late in the session, the Dow ended at a record high while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite dipped. "I think all we're doing is trimming our sails a little from the violently positive rally we had post-election results last week," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has been under pressure since the Nov. 8 election as investors poured money into sectors such as financials, industrials and energy, which are seen benefiting from President-elect Donald Trump's policies. The financial index rose 2.3 percent, with banks including Bank of America JPMorgan providing the biggest boost. The index has risen 10.8 percent since the election on hopes of deregulation and higher interest rates. While the financial rally gained steam, the S&P technology index closed down 1.7 percent, leading the decliners. The index has fallen 3 percent since the election. Apple fell 2.5 percent and weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, followed by Facebook and Microsoft. Since technology valuations have soared in recent years, investors are switching money to sectors such as banks, which has been relatively cheaper but should now benefit from rising interest rates, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Investors have been betting technology will look relatively less attractive if Trump lives up to his promise to review regulation in healthcare and financial sectors and to increase government spending on infrastructure to boost economic growth. "If growth becomes more even and available, we may see a continuation of rotation into lower-valuation, more cyclical businesses and out of high-valuation growth stocks like technology," said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.03 points, or 0.11 percent, to 18,868.69, the S&P 500 lost 0.25 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,164.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.72 points, or 0.36 percent, to 5,218.40. The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting, with traders pricing in a 91-percent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The industrial index finished up 0.4 percent, buoyed by prospects for increased infrastructure outlays. Harman International rose 25.2 percent to $109.72 after Samsung Electronics announced an $8 billion deal to buy the company. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.44-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 82 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 423 new highs and 31 new lows. About 10 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday, far above the 7.7 billion average for the previous 20 sessions.

 Trivago files to go public in what could be one of the biggest IPOs of the year Portia Crowe Nov. 14, 2016, 4:12 PM 5,564 facebook linkedin twitter email print YouTube/trivago Trivago, the online hotel search company backed by Expedia, has filed to go public. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley are leading the deal, which will list on the Nasdaq under the ticker "TRVG." Allen & Company, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Cowen and Company, and Guggenheim Securities are also on the deal. Analysts have previously valued Trivago at $5 billion . Business Insider previously reported that Trivago was looking to list its shares by the end of November. A filing at this point in the month makes that impossible, but Trivago could still debut before the end of the year.  Expedia said in July that Trivago had generated $200 million in revenue in the second quarter, and more than $660 million on a trailing 12-month basis. The listing would mark another step toward the tech IPO market's comeback. Deal activity all but stopped last year as investor sentiment soured, and has been slow to pick up in 2016.  The largest tech IPO to date was by Japanese messaging app Line, which listed in Tokyo and New York in July and raised $1.24 billion, about two-thirds of which was in the US. Nasdaq vice chairman Bruce Aust told Business Insider earlier this month that he expects four or five technology IPOs before the end of the year.  SEE ALSO: Reynolds American has reportedly rejected British American Tobacco's $47 billion takeover offer NOW WATCH: Twitter will lay off more than 300 employees to cut costs Loading video...

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it Trader Gordon Charlop works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016. Stocks are opening modestly higher on Wall Street, led by gains in banks as interest rates continue to rise. (Richard Drew/Associated Press) By Marley Jay | AP November 14 NEW YORK — U.S. stocks came back from an early loss and finished almost unchanged Monday. Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week’s election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump’s policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. “The market is sniffing out the belief that some of these Trump policies may drive some better economic growth but also may in fact be somewhat inflationary,” said PNC Chief Investment Strategist Bill Stone. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple gave up $2.72, or 2.5 percent, to $105.71 while Facebook declined $3.94, or 3.3 percent, to $115.08 and Microsoft slid 90 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $58.12. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $18.53, or 2.4 percent, to $753.22. Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump’s spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 2.25 percent from 2.14 percent late Thursday. Bond trading was closed Friday for the Veterans’ Day holiday. The day before the Nov. 8 election, the yield was 1.83 percent. That’s a huge move for that benchmark rate. Goldman Sachs rose $5.24 percent, to 2.6 percent, to $209.18 and Bank of America rose $1.06, or 5.6 percent, to $20.08. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.82, or 3.7 percent, to $79.51. Stone said investors are focused on potential corporate and individual tax cuts, a “wave of deregulation” that eliminates some of the rules governing businesses like energy companies and banks, and more protectionism on trade, which could hurt sales for companies that do a lot of business overseas. Investors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. For example, Trump’s election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Stone added that corporate dealmaking could increase if Trump’s administration takes a looser approach to antitrust regulation. Several companies announced deals or deal offers Monday. South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes electronics for cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.07, or 25.2 percent, to $109.72. German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor’s stock rose $5.61, or 18.3 percent, to $36.29. Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.75, or 15 percent, to $13.40 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it’s too low. Belden stock added $1.52, or 2.2 percent, to $71.22. The dollar rose against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.51 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0726 from $1.0845. Investors are also selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. Verizon fell 51 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $46.18 and American Electric Power lost $1.27, or 2.1 percent, to $58.72. Oil prices bounced back from a big loss early on. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped just 9 cents to $43.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 32 cents to $44.43 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.28 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 13 cents, or 5 percent, to $2.75 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $2.60 to $1,221.70 an ounce. Silver lost 49 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $16.89 an ounce. Copper picked up 1 cent to $2.52 a pound. France’s CAC 40 rose 0.4 percent and Germany’s DAX added 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed 0.3 percent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 percent after a strong reading on Japan’s economic growth. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent. ____ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

By: Reuters | Published:November 15, 2016 2:09 am President-elect Donald Trump. (AP Photo) US stocks were lower in early afternoon trading on Monday as tech stocks weighed and investors looked for more clarity on President-elect Donald Trump’s policies. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has remained under pressure as investors pour more money in other sectors that are seen benefiting from Trump’s policies. The S&P technology index’s 2.08 percent fall led the decliners, with the index having lost more than 3 percent since the election last week. Apple was down 3.4 percent and weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, followed by Facebook and Microsoft. Visa’s 5.5 percent fall dragged the Dow. The Dow, which capped off its best week in five years on Friday, hit a another record-high just after the start of trading but soon lost those gains. Since Trump’s triumph last Tuesday, investors have been betting on his campaign promises to simplify regulation in the health and financial sectors and boost spending on infrastructure. Watch What Else Is Making News  However, analysts said investors want specific details regarding Trump’s policies and are also awaiting key appointments in his administration. “In any election cycle, many candidates make a lot of election promises and obviously they can’t deliver for a variety of reasons on all these promises,” said Mohannad Aama, managing director at Beam Capital Management in New York. “Right now during this transition period, there is a lot of pricing in the unknown.” The financial index rose 1.77 percent, with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan providing the biggest boost. The index has risen over 8 percent in the last three sessions on hopes of deregulation and higher interest rates. The industrial index was also up 0.36 percent, buoyed by prospects for increased infrastructure outlays. At 12:40 p.m. ET (1740 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 9.28 points, or 0.05 percent, at 18,838.38, the S&P 500 was down 5.51 points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,158.94 and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 35.30 points, or 0.67 percent, at 5,201.81. The risk of faster domestic inflation and wider budget deficits if Trump goes on a spending binge sent yields on U.S. Treasury and other benchmark global bonds higher. The dollar index surged to an 11-month high. Yields on the U.S. 10-year Treasury notes climbed to their highest since January on Monday at 2.30 percent, while 30-year paper shot above 3 percent. Rising inflation hurts bond prices because it makes their future interest payments worth less. A host of U.S. Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to make appearances on Monday, including Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker and San Francisco Fed President John Williams. The central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting, with traders pricing in an 91 percent chance, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Oil fell more than 2 percent to its lowest in three months, as the prospect of another year of oversupply and weak prices overshadowed chances OPEC will reach a deal to cut output. Harman International rose 25.1 percent to $109.66 after Samsung Electronics announced an $8 billion deal to buy the company. Mentor Graphics surged more than 19 percent to a record high of $36.55 after Siemens agreed to buy the company in a $4.5 billion deal. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,604 to 1,388. On the Nasdaq, 1,532 issues rose and 1,247 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 79 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 394 new highs and 24 new lows.

Photograph: Daniel Leal-Olivas/AFP/Getty Images Monday 14 November 2016 15.06 EST Last modified on Monday 14 November 2016 17.59 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger It remains early days for assessing Donald Trump’s economic plans, not least because of the difficulty in separating the serious policies from the wilder campaigning rhetoric, but the bond market seems clear on the central point: the president-elect intends to cut tax taxes, increase spending and deregulate. Investors know what that cocktail produces. It boosts growth, at least for a while, and it generates inflation. Even famed liberal economist Paul Krugman has switched from predicting an imminent global recession. “Don’t be surprised if economic growth actually accelerates for a couple of years,” he says, because the “dire effects of Trumpism” will take time to become manifest. In the bond market, a mini-rout is under way as yields on government debt climb across the board. US 1o-year Treasuries were yielding 1.35% in the summer and 1.85% on the eve of Trump’s victory; now they are 2.19%, a huge move in such a short space of time. In the UK, the 10-year gilt yield, which fell as low as 0.5% in the same summer lull, is now 1.4%. Global bonds slump as Trump prompts inflation fears Read more A return of more normal yields, encouraged by the prospect of fiscal stimulus and higher rates of growth, is just what the world has been crying out for, many at both ends of the political spectrum would agree. Years of near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing haven’t rebooted the global economy, so try something different. Well, yes, but let’s not pretend that such fiscal medicine is risk-free, especially when taken in the dosage Trump intends. A cut in the business tax rate from 35% to 15%, and $550bn to be spent on new infrastructure, represent crisis-style responses. But, as JP Morgan’s chief global strategist David Kelly argues, the idea that the US is massively underperforming its potential for growth and requires a big fiscal stimulus is wrong. The US economy is at virtual full employment and the federal budget deficit is already rising. Indeed, the US Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated in September that Trump’s plans for massive personal and corporate tax cuts plus more defence spending would push the US national debt to 105% of GDP by 2026, against 77% currently and 86% assumed for 2026 under current laws. “The truth is, boosting the federal debt to these levels is fiscally reckless,” argues Kelly. The inflationary impact of a spending spree looks likely to be even more severe if the US is simultaneously blocking skilled immigration and imposing 1930s-style trade tariffs around the world. A big boom followed by an almighty bust? That script seems very plausible. Nor should we surprised if there are accidents on the way. In the early days of quantitative easing, central banks used to warn us that the exit from the bond bubble they created would have to be managed carefully because of its capacity to destabilise the financial system. You can understand why they worried: if government debt, supposedly the safest form of asset, is suddenly imposing double-digit losses on holders, there will be consequences. Prepare to see them soon: the bond bubble has been 30 years in the making and it won’t deflate painlessly. William Hill back in the race after failed merger It should not be news that a gambling company is appointing to its board some non-executives with experience of the gambling industry. It is at William Hill, where the boardroom is currently populated by non-specialists, a shortcoming that was cruelly exposed when shareholders shot down the board’s half-baked idea of exploring a £4.6bn merger with Amaya, a Canadian online poker company. John O’Reilly, formerly of Ladbrokes and Coral, and Mark Brooker, former chief operating officer at Betfair, will improve the board’s gambling quota from zero to two. Robin Terrell, a former digital wizard for Tesco, also looks a sensible hire. Gareth Davis, chairman for the past six years, did not explain why the obvious gap in expertise had not been filled previously but he has heard the criticisms and responded, which may quell the calls for his own departure. Full rehabilitation will depend on the two other factors. First, the company needs to avoid further trading upsets while Davis completes his search for a chief executive to relieve Philip Bowman, whose own lack of a gambling background makes him an imperfect candidate. On that front, news that full-year operating profits are still expected to arrive towards the top of a £260m to £280m range gets a tick. The other factor will be evidence that William Hill won’t have its head turned by the next flashy Amaya-style proposal. The new boardroom appointments suggest self-help is indeed the priority again. Good, but the path to this point should not have been so roundabout.

KEEPING SCORE: The Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.2 percent to 3,204.31 points and Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 was flat at 17,670.77. Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 tumbled 0.5 percent to 5,320.60 and Seoul’s Kospi was almost unchanged at 1,974.27. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 0.4 percent to 22,314.62. Benchmarks in Southeast Asia and New Zealand were mixed. WALL STREET: Tech companies including Apple and Microsoft took big losses on concern Trump’s policies might hurt their sales in China and other global markets. Bank stocks surged as bond yields rose, which allows them to make more money from lending. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. RISING DOLLAR: The dollar climbed as high as 108.30 yen from Monday’s 107.87 yen as expectations of a U.S. rate hike rose. Trump’s surprise election initially raised expectations the Federal Reserve might put off a rate hike until his plans were clear. But analysts say the latest comments from Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan indicate the Fed is sticking to plans to act in December. “There appears no stopping the U.S. dollar’s recent ascent based on the current interest rate trajectory,” Stephen Innes of OANDA said in a report. TRUMP WATCH: Investors were watching for signs of what Trump, who gave few details of his plans on the campaign trail, might do in office. Analysts say his promises of tax cuts and higher infrastructure spending could boost economic growth but also spur inflation. His threats of sanctions against China and other trading partners that he accuses of acting unfairly have rattled trade-dependent Asian economies. ANALYST’S TAKE: “Moving forward, the spotlight could shine on the contentious trade policy proposals that the president-elect had raised during his campaign,” said Jingyi Pan of IG in a report. “The latest soundbite from outgoing President Barack Obama seems to suggest that the incoming president is ‘ultimately pragmatic’,” said Pan. “It is without a doubt that emerging Asian markets would be negatively impacted should a trade war break out between US and China, although the delayed address could mean that the President-elect may indeed be more pragmatic than we have known.” CURRENCY: The euro was little-changed at $1.0752. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude gained 89 cents to $44.21 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract shed 9 cents on Monday to close at $43.32. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 75 cents to $45.19 in London. It lost 32 cents on Monday to $44.43.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidMore By Sinead Carew (Reuters) - U.S. stocks closed little changed on Monday after rising dramatically the week before and a decline in the technology sector offset a steep rise in financial stocks as investors bet on higher interest rates. After choppy trading late in the session, the Dow ended at a record high while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite dipped. "I think all we're doing is trimming our sails a little from the violently positive rally we had post-election results last week," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has been under pressure since the Nov. 8 election as investors poured money into sectors such as financials, industrials and energy, which are seen benefiting from President-elect Donald Trump's policies. The financial index <.SPSY> rose 2.3 percent, with banks including Bank of America JPMorgan providing the biggest boost. The index has risen 10.8 percent since the election on hopes of deregulation and higher interest rates. While the financial rally gained steam, the S&P technology index <.SPLRCT> closed down 1.7 percent, leading the decliners. The index has fallen 3 percent since the election. Apple fell 2.5 percent and weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, followed by Facebook and Microsoft . Since technology valuations have soared in recent years, investors are switching money to sectors such as banks, which has been relatively cheaper but should now benefit from rising interest rates, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Investors have been betting technology will look relatively less attractive if Trump lives up to his promise to review regulation in healthcare and financial sectors and to increase government spending on infrastructure to boost economic growth. "If growth becomes more even and available, we may see a continuation of rotation into lower-valuation, more cyclical businesses and out of high-valuation growth stocks like technology," said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> closed up 21.03 points, or 0.11 percent, to 18,868.69, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 0.25 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,164.2 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 18.72 points, or 0.36 percent, to 5,218.40. The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting, with traders pricing in a 91-percent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The industrial index <.SPLRCI> finished up 0.4 percent, buoyed by prospects for increased infrastructure outlays. Harman International rose 25.2 percent to $109.72 after Samsung Electronics <005930.KS> announced an $8 billion deal to buy the company. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.44-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 82 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 423 new highs and 31 new lows. About 10 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday, far above the 7.7 billion average for the previous 20 sessions.

Treasury Pick Mnuchin Drew Praise, Scorn After IndyMac Deal By Kristin Broughton November 14, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Risk taker: "He took a company that was a very visibly failed institution of the mortgage crisis and rehabilitated it," an analyst said about Steven Mnuchin's career in banking.

Before Steven Mnuchin became President-elect Donald Trump's likely nominee to lead the Treasury Department, he was a driving force behind one of the most controversial banking turnarounds during the financial crisis. Mnuchin was the top fundraiser for Trump's victorious presidential campaign. That experience has paid off in a big way for the former Wall Street banker, whom Trump's transition team has recommended that he nominate for Treasury secretary, according to a Bloomberg News report citing sources familiar with the process. Other candidates floated in connection with the job included House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling and even JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. Mnuchin, who spent nearly two decades at Goldman Sachs, had drawn attention in recent years for a big gamble he and fellow investors took in commercial banking. He was instrumental in the recapitalization of the failed mortgage lender IndyMac, its return to financial health as OneWest Bank and its ultimate sale to CIT Group in a lucrative deal. He joined the CIT board after the 2015 sale and has since pushed the $66 billion-asset company to slim down and boost returns. How that experience will translate into a career in public service is unclear. Though Mnuchin — who has never held public office — has a track record of success in financial services, there have also been hiccups along the way, including criticism from community groups for ignoring the needs of underserved communities. "He took a company that was a very visibly failed institution of the mortgage crisis and rehabilitated it," said Vincent Caintic, an analyst with Stephens. "He made it into a stable and viable company and sold it successfully for double the money." Caintic said that Mnuchin's experience rehabilitating companies could bode well for a career in government. Additionally, the fact that he worked closely with regulators, negotiating the terms of a failed-bank acquisition, could work in his favor. But memories of Mnuchin's crisis-era move into banking still gnaw at some community activists. Mnuchin in 2009 led a group of Wall Street investors — including George Soros and John Paulson — in rebuilding IndyMac under the OneWest brand. "In some ways, the bank was the poster child for income inequality," said Kevin Stein, deputy director at the California Reinvestment Coalition, noting the disconnect between the high-profile bank investors and borrowers who were struggling during the crisis to pay their mortgages. Stein said that the company generated ill will around its Pasadena, Calif., footprint, in particular, because of foreclosures it made on widows through Financial Freedom, its reverse-mortgage-servicing business. Financial Freedom is currently under investigation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for issues related to its accounting. CIT has discontinued the business. The deal also was one of those that attracted intense scrutiny because of the windfall it generated for private-equity investors, former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chair Sheila Bair has said. Though a nomination is uncertain, especially in as fluid a situation as the days following Trump's stunning win over Hillary Clinton, it would mark a career shift for Mnuchin, a financial executive who has had a somewhat peripatetic career. Mnuchin began his financial services career in 1985 at Goldman, where he ultimately rose to partner and chief information officer. He left the investment banking giant in 2002 and, two years later, established the investment firm Dune Capital Management. Outside of his career in banking, he has also earned a reputation in film. He has helped finance hit movies such as "Avatar." He also briefly served as co-chairman of Relativity Media but resigned last year before the Beverly Hills, Calif., studio filed for bankruptcy. Within the world of bread-and-butter banking, though, Mnuchin has earned a reputation for getting results. Mnuchin decided to enter the business back in 2008, when he saw a TV news shot of customers lined up outside of the $32 billion-asset IndyMac, hoping to withdraw their money. He decided that the time was right to buy a bank, according to a Bloomberg Businessweek story on him. He led a group of investors who bought the assets of IndyMac in 2009, nine months after its blockbuster failure. The group negotiated lucrative terms to a loss-share agreement with the FDIC and within less than a year turned a $1.6 billion profit. As chairman of the newly formed OneWest, Mnuchin helped lead a rapid turnaround. The company moved away from risky mortgage loans and sought to become a more of a "full-service" regional bank with additional branches, according to Caintic. In August 2015, OneWest was sold to CIT, which was run at the time by Wall Street icon John Thain. The deal pushed CIT — another crisis-era turnaround story — above the threshold to be considered a systemically important financial institution. A key priority of Thain was asset growth and burnishing CIT's reputation as a major industry player. But Mnuchin has been influential in pushing CIT to focus, instead, on boosting returns and simplifying its business model. « 1  |  2 »     view entire article Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints JOIN THE DISCUSSION Comment SEE MORE IN National/Regional RELATED TAGS Law & Regulation, Dealmaking & Strategy Comments (0) Be the first to comment on this post using the section below.

Visa's 5.5 percent fall dragged the Dow.The Dow, which capped off its best week in five years on Friday, hit a another record-high just after the start of trading but soon lost those gains.Since Trump's triumph last Tuesday, investors have been betting on his campaign promises to simplify regulation in the health and financial sectors and boost spending on infrastructure.However, analysts said investors want specific details regarding Trump's policies and are also awaiting key appointments in his administration."In any election cycle, many candidates make a lot of election promises and obviously they can't deliver for a variety of reasons on all these promises," said Mohannad Aama, managing director at Beam Capital Management in New York. "Right now during this transition period, there is a lot of pricing in the unknown."The financial index rose 1.77 percent, with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan providing the biggest boost. The index has risen over 8 percent in the last three sessions on hopes of deregulation and higher interest rates.The industrial index was also up 0.36 percent, buoyed by prospects for increased infrastructure outlays.At 12:40 p.m. ET (1740 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 9.28 points, or 0.05 percent, at 18,838.38, the S&P 500 was down 5.51 points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,158.94 and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 35.30 points, or 0.67 percent, at 5,201.81. The risk of faster domestic inflation and wider budget deficits if Trump goes on a spending binge sent yields on U.S. Treasury and other benchmark global bonds higher. The dollar index surged to an 11-month high.Yields on the U.S. 10-year Treasury notes climbed to their highest since January on Monday at 2.30 percent, while 30-year paper shot above 3 percent.Rising inflation hurts bond prices because it makes their future interest payments worth less.A host of U.S. Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to make appearances on Monday, including Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker and San Francisco Fed President John Williams. The central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting, with traders pricing in an 91 percent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.Oil fell more than 2 percent to its lowest in three months, as the prospect of another year of oversupply and weak prices overshadowed chances OPEC will reach a deal to cut output. Harman International rose 25.1 percent to $109.66 after Samsung Electronics announced an $8 billion deal to buy the company.Mentor Graphics surged more than 19 percent to a record high of $36.55 after Siemens agreed to buy the company in a $4.5 billion deal.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,604 to 1,388. On the Nasdaq, 1,532 issues rose and 1,247 fell.The S&P 500 index showed 79 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 394 new highs and 24 new lows.

Lost in the post-election stock market euphoria is the fact that the bond market has suffered a dramatic wave of selling that is rare in recent history. It’s sent interest rates on U.S. bonds spiking, making it more expensive for the federal government to borrow money. The rate on 10-year Treasury notes has surged to 2.3%, from 1.77% before the election. Last week’s spike in Treasury rates was so big, that it had only happened three times before in the last decade. BlackRock’s Russ Koesterich called it a “violent reaction.” The move stands to have broad repercussions for all Americans. Not only will the U.S. government have to pay more to borrow money, but mortgage rates and car loan costs should also rise. That’s because Treasuries are used as the benchmark for many other forms of credit. The bond market’s reaction shows investors believe Trump’s plans will add to America’s already-massive debt load and cause inflation to rise. Here’s a rundown on the major forces causing the bond market to tank: Spending concerns: Trump has pledged to give the American economy a shot in the arm by spending heavily on infrastructure. “We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,” Trump declared in his victory speech. That pledge has been great news for infrastructure stocks like Caterpillar and U.S. Steel. Trump’s win has also sent defense stocks like Lockheed Martin flying higher because he wants to ramp up military spending. But the bond market is concerned about whether America can afford all of that spending. “The federal budget is already dangerously out of balance,” David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds, wrote in a note on Monday. Debt worries: On top of heavy spending, Trump has promised massive tax cuts that would reduce revenue by $7 trillion in the first decade alone, according to the Tax Policy Center. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates Trump’s fiscal plans, especially the tax cuts, would cause the U.S. debt to soar to 143% of GDP by 2026, compared with 104% today. “The truth is boosting the federal debt to these levels is fiscally reckless,” Kelly wrote. That partly explains why the 30-year Treasury rate topped 3% on Monday for the first time since January. Inflation back from the dead? Investors are also bracing for Trump stimulus to carry inflation out of the post-crisis doldrums. Prices could also rise if Trump’s anti-trade stance means more goods are made in America, according to Ed Yardeni, president of investment advisory Yardeni Research, wrote in a note. “The bond market seems to be raising the odds of Trumponomics’ inflationary consequences,” Yardeni wrote in a note. Fed rate hikes: Rates are rising because many anticipate the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates next month for the first time in a year. If Trump’s policies end up causing growth and inflation to tick up, it could cause the Fed to raise rates faster than previously planned. Fallout: It’s possible the bond market reaction is overdone. Much will depend on what policies Trump actually pursues — and how much support he gets from the Republican-led Congress. However, if bonds continue to sell off, the consequences could be profound. Higher rates will make it more expensive for the U.S. government to finance its increasingly-large debt load. Bespoke Investment Group warns “soaring” Treasury rates signal a significant jump in mortgage rates that on top of rising home prices could hurt the housing market. So far, the stock market hasn’t seemed too concerned by the rip higher in bond rates. But that may change. After all, extremely low interest rates helped fuel the stock market’s rise over the past seven years. By contrast, higher returns for risk-free Treasuries may make investors think twice before betting on risky stocks. Continued selling in the bond market could also mark the end of the decades-long bull market in bonds. BlackRock’s Koesterich said absent a “pretty catastrophic shock” to the global economy, bond rates likely bottomed earlier this year. Walter Zimmerman, senior vice president at United-ICAP, argues the “historic bubble has burst” and warns that selling could be dramatic. “No speculative bubble in history has ever slowly leaked out,” Zimmerman said.

Posted 14 Nov 2016 22:10 Updated 15 Nov 2016 06:00 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., November 10, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: U.S. stocks closed little changed on Monday after rising dramatically the week before and a decline in the technology sector offset a steep rise in financial stocks as investors bet on higher interest rates. After choppy trading late in the session, the Dow ended at a record high while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite dipped. "I think all we're doing is trimming our sails a little from the violently positive rally we had post-election results last week," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has been under pressure since the Nov. 8 election as investors poured money into sectors such as financials, industrials and energy, which are seen benefiting from President-elect Donald Trump's policies. The financial index rose 2.3 percent, with banks including Bank of America JPMorgan providing the biggest boost. The index has risen 10.8 percent since the election on hopes of deregulation and higher interest rates. While the financial rally gained steam, the S&P technology index closed down 1.7 percent, leading the decliners. The index has fallen 3 percent since the election. Apple fell 2.5 percent and weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, followed by Facebook and Microsoft. Since technology valuations have soared in recent years, investors are switching money to sectors such as banks, which has been relatively cheaper but should now benefit from rising interest rates, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Investors have been betting technology will look relatively less attractive if Trump lives up to his promise to review regulation in healthcare and financial sectors and to increase government spending on infrastructure to boost economic growth. "If growth becomes more even and available, we may see a continuation of rotation into lower-valuation, more cyclical businesses and out of high-valuation growth stocks like technology," said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.03 points, or 0.11 percent, to 18,868.69, the S&P 500 lost 0.25 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,164.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.72 points, or 0.36 percent, to 5,218.40. The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting, with traders pricing in a 91-percent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The industrial index finished up 0.4 percent, buoyed by prospects for increased infrastructure outlays. Harman International rose 25.2 percent to US$109.72 after Samsung Electronics announced an US$8 billion deal to buy the company. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.44-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 82 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 423 new highs and 31 new lows. About 10 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges on Monday, far above the 7.7 billion average for the previous 20 sessions.

Photo: AP SEE ALSO Why the markets decided to love Trump after all :0 When the unexpected happens, like Britain exiting the European Union... Why the markets decided to love Trump after all The Donald Trump rally spread to a fourth day on Monday morning. The Dow Jones industrial average opened at a record high, driven by financial stocks, after the index capped off its best week since 2011 following Trump’s unexpected victory in the presidential election on Nov. 8. The Dow was up in each of the three days since the Trump victory. Since Trump’s triumph last Tuesday, investors have been betting on his campaign promises to simplify regulation in the health and financial sectors and boost spending on infrastructure. The Dow rose 2.2 percent to its highest level since 2008. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan provided the biggest boost to both the S&P 500 and the Dow. The Nasdaq Composite was little changed, weighed down by tech giants Apple, Facebook and Microsoft. Stock markets around the world were affected by a continued selloff in the global bond market as investors looked for more clarity regarding Trump’s policies. The risk of faster domestic inflation and wider budget deficits if Trump goes on a spending binge sent yields on Treasury and other benchmark global bonds higher. The dollar index surged to an 11-month high. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes climbed to their highest since January on Monday at 2.30 percent, while 30-year paper shot above 3 percent. “The bond market could subject the Trump rally to a halt,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. “The prospect of higher inflation due to higher fiscal spending under the Trump administration has caused bonds to sell off and while higher inflation is good for the US economy in the long run, it is seen as a negative factor in the short term because this market is used to near zero interest rates.” At 10:55 a.m. , the Dow was up 10 points, to 18,857.18. The S&P 500 was down 3 points , at 2,161.72. The Nasdaq Composite was down 26 points, 5,210.77. A host of Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to make appearances on Monday, including Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker and San Francisco Fed President John Williams. The central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting, with traders pricing in an 81 percent chance, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said on Friday economic growth prospects appear strong enough for a gradual hike in interest rates. Oil prices were at around three-month lows as the prospect of another year of oversupply and weak prices overshadowed chances that OPEC would reach a deal to cut output.

According to a research report published today, Blacks and Latinos are “severely underrepresented” among borrowers who obtained a loan from a major bank to purchase a home in the city of Oakland. The report, by the Greenlining Institute and Urban Strategies Council, also found that banks issued a much smaller total number of home mortgage loans in Oakland compared to Fresno and Long Beach, two other cities analyzed in the study. And Black and Latino borrowers in Oakland applied for home loans at very low rates, and were approved at lower rates than whites. This dearth in mortgage lending by major banks in Oakland, compounded by low numbers of mortgage loan applications from Black and Latino customers, and lower loan approval rates, is perpetuating and exacerbating wealth disparities, the authors of the study concluded. See also: JP Morgan Chase's Home Loans in Oakland Mostly Went to White and Wealthy Residents The study analyzed bank lending data for the year 2013 that was obtained from the federal government. The twelve largest banks, measured by the total dollar amount of loans originated in California, were included in the study. The authors compared Oakland, Fresno, and Long Beach because these cities are of similar size and have racially diverse populations, and they represent different geographic areas of the state with different economies. The data analyzed by the Greenlining Institute and Urban Strategies Council showed that major banks are making far fewer total mortgage loans in Oakland compared to Fresno and Long Beach. “Despite comparable populations, Oakland had less than one quarter as many loan applications and originations as Long Beach and Fresno,” the report states. It’s unclear why major banks are approving fewer home loans in Oakland, but it may be due to Oakland’s increasingly unaffordable prices, and the presence of cash investors who crowd out buyers who need bank loans to close a deal. Whatever the cause, this lower level of bank lending in Oakland is compounded by racial disparities. According to the report, Black and Latino residents make up 56 percent of Oakland’s total population, but they received just 10 percent of the total dollars lent by major banks for home purchases. “Across the board, what the report shows is that Black and Latino communities were way under-represented when it comes to obtaining mortgage loans,” said Zachary Murray of the Greenlining Institute, one of the authors of the report. Greenlining Institute and Urban Strategies Council found that in 2013 the top twelve banks only approved a total of four loans for Black borrowers to purchase homes in the city of Oakland. The other 44 home mortgage loans made to Black borrowers in Oakland were refinance loans. In the same year, Latinos only obtained sixty mortgage loans in Oakland, and just seven of these were to purchase a home. By contrast, white borrowers obtained 358 mortgage loans in 2013 and 40 of these were to purchase homes. Asians obtained 186 mortgage loans, and 37 of these were to buy a home. Particular banks exhibited wide racial disparities in their mortgage lending activities. According to the report, Wells Fargo Bank, US Bank, and CashCall all exhibited much lower loan origination rates for Blacks and Latinos than for Asians and whites. A loan origination rate measures what percent of applicants for a loan are approved and receive the loan. Some banks, including Chase and Bank of America did better, originating loans at almost equal rates for Black and Latino customers as they did for white and Asian customers. But for all of the twelve banks analyzed in the report, white and Asian customers were more likely to have their loans approved than Black and Latino customers. Sasha Werblin of Greenlining, one of the authors of the study, said that lower average household wealth and income could be one reason that Blacks and Latinos are less able to obtain home loans. The economic crisis and recession of 2007-2010, and the foreclosure crisis that peaked in 2011-2012 reduced the savings of many families, and had a disproportionately harmful impact on Black and Latino households in California. But Werblin said that it is also incumbent on banks to offer sustainable and quality financial products that help them build wealth and secure housing. “What are banks doing to market to these individuals? Do they have products that would fit the needs of these individuals?” said Weblin in a previous interview.

Back to site Activism Banking Spain These Spanish Activists Have Taken Punishing Bankers Into Their Own Hands Their work is a model for citizen action against the architects of financial collapse. By Anne Koch Yesterday 8:00 am Facebook Twitter Email Print Protestors wear masks of Rodrigo Rato, the former director of the International Monetary Fund, as they march outside the National Court, Madrid, Spain, December 20, 2012. (AP Photo / Andres Kudacki) It is often said that no one responsible for the financial crash of 2008 ever went to prison. In Spain, however, a group of ordinary citizens are in the process of dragging one of Spain’s most eminent bankers through the criminal courts for fraud, money laundering, and embezzlement. Ad Policy At the heart of this campaign is Simona Levi, a slight, dark-haired, softly spoken woman, born in Turin to left-wing intellectuals, and related to Primo Levi. She is a dancer and actress by training, a student of Turin’s School of Dance and of Jacques Lecoq’s theater school in Paris. She has lived in Barcelona since 1990. A theater director and a performance artist, she is also a prominent activist in a variety of movements for social justice. Levi’s opponent is Rodrigo Rato, a former president of Bankia, one of the biggest banks in Spain, and a banker of global repute, once holding the top job at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington. As respected and powerful in Spain as JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was on Wall Street, Rato presided over a massive fraudulent sale of the bank’s shares. Rodrigo Rato is now facing jail, a success for Simona Levi and an unlikely group of people of which she is leader. It demonstrates that bankers can be brought to justice when ordinary people unite and force prosecutors to do their jobs. The 2008 economic crisis hit Spain hard. The government brought in tough austerity measures, and inequality and unemployment rose sharply—at its peak, more than one-quarter of the working population was out of work. Despair was widespread and people were angry—as in other Southern European countries, conditions triggered popular protest. Simona Levi reacted by setting up an organization with a group of activists. It became known as Xnet, “a peaceful guerrilla movement,” as she puts it. Their manifesto, Democracy, period, calls for greater institutional transparency; “wikilegislation,” giving citizens the right to participate in drawing up laws and proposals; and what Xnet calls a “permanent vote” that would ensure referendums are held regularly on important issues. Xnet and others also created a political party, Partido X or X Party. Like many others they wanted to break the hold of the People’s Party and the Spanish Socialist Workers Party, which had taken turns running the country since the death of the fascist dictator Franco in 1975 and whose misrule had led to the crisis. Austerity in Spain didn’t work. Incomes continued to fall and youth unemployment reached a staggering 46 percent in the autumn of 2011. Popular protest movements grew. On May 15, 2011 the main squares in cities and towns throughout Spain were occupied for weeks; the movement that would later be called the Indignados, also known as 15M for the day it began, demanded radical political change, and out of the mass occupations, collectives of activists and citizens organized themselves into neighborhood and workplace assemblies. Simona Levi and Xnet were part of this movement.

Levi was appalled and couldn’t understand how it had happened. She invited some other Xnet members to an informal meeting in a bar off Las Ramblas to discuss what they could do. Those around the table were activists Levi previously had gone to battle with and trusted, and were, she said, people she valued for their independence of thought. They included a gardener, a chef, and a young female IT expert. Sipping their drinks, they talked about how the government had given billions of euros to the banks, but despite this, the crisis had only worsened; now it was Bankia that had failed. Levi had read two pieces of news that horrified her: Bankia had swallowed up a quarter of all the government financing, received by Spain from the EU, to bail out the banks. According to Levi’s calculations, the failure of this single bank accounted for one-seventh of the whole of Spanish government debt. She told me how shocked she was when she saw the latter figure in particular; it was her light-bulb moment, she said. She’d been reading about the fiasco in Iceland and following the work being done by one of the Indignado groupings, the Citizen Debt Audit Platform, but when she read the Bankia figures, it struck her, as she put it to me, that “you have to do something very wrong to have a debt like that.” No one gathered in the bar with her could explain it, so Levi proposed that Xnet try to investigate by focussing on this one bank, Bankia, and its president, Rodrigo Rato. The consequences of this meeting in a Barcelona bar are still unfolding. Bankia was formed in 2010 through the merger of seven small, highly indebted and vulnerable savings banks or “cajas.” The 300-year old Caja Madrid was by far the largest, and its president, Rodrigo Rato, became president of the entire group. The conglomerate was set up to absorb all the profitable business and surviving loans of these cajas, while their risky assets, a result of hugely speculative property deals, were hived off to another specially created bank. This toxic bank would be owned by the government, while the healthy Bankia, now the fourth-largest bank in Spain, with 4,000 branches and 25,000 employees, could be sold off. Its shares were offered to the public in May 2011. However, investment bankers and other financial institutions showed little interest in the IPO, and so most of the initial 3.1 billion euros was raised by selling the shares to small domestic savers—about 360,000 of them. GET A DIGITAL SUBSCRIPTION FOR JUST $9.50! Subscribe Rato, when he took over the banking conglomerate, stood at the pinnacle of Spain’s establishment: He was a former minister of finance and economics, vice president of the center-right People’s Party government; a former managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF); and a partner at Lazard, the prestigious international investment bank. As Simona Levi put it, “He was untouchable, the Margaret Thatcher of Spain, a god for Spanish conservatives, the destroyer of workers’ rights to his enemies, with vast influence, and the architect of the neoliberal policies followed by Spain and other countries.” Under his watch in May 2012 Bankia announced profits of 328 million euros. Then, abruptly, Bankia went bust. Two weeks after Rato had announced Bankia’s profits, he resigned. Under pressure from the Bank of Spain, profit became a loss of more than 4 billion euros. A year later, it would be revised again to a gigantic 19 billion euros, an unimaginable reversal in the accounts for such a large financial institution. This was “the biggest financial debacle in Spanish history,” according to the newspaper El País. The Spanish government took control once more and Bankia was bailed out to the tune of more than 23 billion euros, a figure that has recently been revised upwards—to 46 billion euros. It was the biggest bailout ever of a Spanish financial institution, paid for by taxpayers in Spain and Europe. The deal rode roughshod over Spanish regulations that protect investors: Tragically, almost all of Bankia’s small investors ended up losing most of their money, a loss estimated to be close to 2 billion euros. It was this total reversal in the company accounts that raised suspicions in Levi’s mind, and also galvanized the other members of Xnet. They started with two basic questions. First, the dramatic collapse of Bankia’s share price from about 3.75 euros when it was first listed, to 2.07 euros a year later to 0.01 euros or virtually nothing in just two years, suggested someone hadn’t been telling the truth about the state of the bank when its savers were persuaded to buy Bankia shares. Second, if Bankia’s bailout had absorbed one-seventh of the total amount spent on bailing out the Spanish economy, the managers of the bank must have had ample warning that something was wrong. Levi told me that all she really did was ask why, a question she has been asking since she was a child. “Why did the bank collapse?” Simona Levi, one of the founders of 15 MpaRato, an organization created to investigate Bankia’s collapse, protests at an anti-austerity rally, Plaça de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain, May 2012. (CC BY-SA 2.0) Soon after their meeting in the bar, Levi took the microphone at a huge anti-austerity rally at Plaça de Catalunya (Catalonia Square) in Barcelona in May 2012, announced to those assembled that a group, called 15 MpaRato, had been created to investigate the bank’s collapse, and asked for others to join their efforts. Photographs of the demonstration show a thoughtful, confident, striking woman in a black dress with a print of big red and white flowers. In front of a huge, enthusiastic crowd she announced that they would sue Bankia’s former chairman, Rodrigo Rato, and his accomplices at Bankia. In truth Levi had little evidence, but standing on the platform, thrilled by the response of thousands of people, she called on victims to come forward, appealing to the crowd for evidence and support. The campaign was launched. Levi and the others on the team set out a five-year plan to succeed in convicting Rodgrigo Rato by 2017. * * * Spanish law allows individual citizens or groups to file criminal complaints for review by the court if they believe a law has been broken, regardless of whether they were personally affected. Levi and her Xnet network began by presenting, via lawyers, their two fundamental questions about the workings of Bankia to National Court Judge Fernando Andreu on June 14, 2012. Once he agreed to investigate and seek evidence on his own accord, as is not unusual in Spain, Simona and colleagues continued gathering information to support their case. They also made sure they were part of the case, rather than merely providing evidence and information. They used a variety of approaches. First they worked with lawyers to locate a number of small savers who believed they’d been personally defrauded by the bank but couldn’t say how. Hundreds of citizens also began submitting information online. Evidence that Levi and her friends thought might take a year to gather was collected in just two weeks. The 15MpaRato activists helped analyze the material, and sent it to journalists and lawyers. They also published it online, allowing the public to analyze and share the information themselves. At the same time 15MpaRato launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds to pay for their lawsuit. In just 24 hours, much to Levi’s surprise and delight, they had raised 130 percent of their goal (15,000 euros). The campaign against Bankia quickly became a thriving network. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Xnet’s lawsuit against Rodrigo Rato initially represented 15 people, but grew to 44. Their case was based on five main allegations related to deliberate misinformation, forgery, and fraud. Levi told me that the people who came to them, without exception, had very sad stories. Many of them were pensioners with few savings who had trusted what Levi called “the smart young men in the bank,” and felt humiliated and stupid. Throughout the years Levi worked with this group of people, all of them assumed, as she did, they would never get their money back; they just wanted justice. In early July 2012, after considering the evidence, as well as evidence from others, including one of Spain’s smaller political parties, Judge Andreu indicted Rodrigo Rato and 33 other board members of the bank as well as its parent company as targets of an investigation into alleged financial crimes in the run-up to the bank’s collapse. It was a good start, but 15 MpaRato’s work was far from finished. Levi and the others on the team continued to investigate and in 2013 created an online tool, Xnet Leaks, inspired by Wikileaks. The tool was designed to ensure anonymity for people who wanted to submit information about Rato and others. It works like this: Anyone with information—someone with a complaint or a whistle-blower—is ensured anonymity by accessing the TOR network. This is software that conceals his or her IP address. According to Levi about 10 percent of what they receive is judged to be worth following up on and it is sent to a second mailbox that other Xnet members can access without seeing the original sender’s identity. Then the information or the allegations are handed over to the Spanish media so journalists can probe deeper—and also to legal experts so they can assemble evidence for the ongoing court case. As Simona Levi put it, “It’s an evolution and a domestic adaptation of what we learned from Wikileaks. Less than one year into their five-year plan, by May 2013, they had circulated over 4,000 processed leaks and pieces of evidence, along with jokes and pictures. Important information came in from multiple sources, including Bankia employees. Judge Andreu expanded his investigation from the alleged fraudulent sale of shares at the time of Bankia’s flotation and opened a second front as a result of the leaks the activists had received. He now began investigating how the two biggest banks in the Bankia conglomerate in addition had sold one financial product in particular: “preferentes” or preferred shares to small savers for over 10 years. Preferred shares are complex, high-risk financial products that can legally be sold only to people with demonstrated financial knowledge, after the risks had been explained to them. Some workers in Bankia leaked an internal document related to the preferred shares, which had been circulated to managers and branches, and which explained how to encourage small savers to buy these preferred shares. Printed on every page was a notice that read: “This information should not be visible to customers.” Despite the fact that these shares are considered to be suitable only for experienced investors, it later emerged that some who sunk their investments into the Bankia scheme were so poorly educated that they had to sign the contract with a fingerprint. A source within the National Stock Exchange Commission leaked an internal commission document to 15MpaRato showing how small savers were encouraged to buy these preferentes with intentionally misleading information. Judge Andreu now had evidence of falsified accounts and information related to the public offering of bank shares, and, in addition, evidence of a 10-year history of bank customers’ being deliberately misled into risky products. Levi and her group were able to ask him to initiate criminal proceedings against Bankia, based on Article 282 bis of the Spanish Criminal Court, which covers fraud and misrepresentation in connection with the sale of securities. Judge Andreu agreed, thanks to leaks received by Levi and her colleagues. In Spain, violating Article 282 is punishable with up to six years imprisonment. Judge Andreu then commissioned a report by two experts at the Bank of Spain who later were to reaffirm that there were inconsistencies in the published information regarding Bankia’s flotation and in later reports of the bank’s accounts—and that they were falsified by Rato and his successor, who had been aware of it and had deliberately concealed it. * * * Further explosive revelations were to follow, opening up yet another investigation. In December 2013, about 18 months into Levi’s five-year plan, the media and citizens learned about the contents of around 8000 e-mails from Caja Madrid (as noted previously, the largest of the seven small banks that united to form Bankia), which were leaked to 15MpaRato—“another extremely useful source” as Levi put it matter-of-factly. The huge tranche of e-mails, and the scandal itself became known as the “Blesa’s e-mails” or the “Blesa black-card case,” after Miguel Blesa, effectively Rodrigo Rato’s predecessor at the bank. “Blesa’s e-mails” revealed that when Miguel Blesa was in charge, and during the transition to the leadership of Rodrigo Rato, bank executives used corporate credit cards to spend some 15 million euros of bank money on luxury goods, lavish holidays, and even petty supermarket purchases. Rodrigo Rato himself, the e-mails reveal, misused his company credit card, making 159 purchases between October 24, 2010 and November 28, 2011, spending almost 100,000 euros on alcoholic beverages, shoes, and tailoring; in restaurants and garden centers and elsewhere. They also showed that two days before he quit as chairman of Bankia, Rato took out 1,000 euros in cash on his corporate credit card. The e-mails reveal personal greed, but also that political favors, loans, and bribes were paid—and that political parties and trade unions were aware of this and took the funds from the bank regardless: Eighty-six people from every main political party and trade union were in receipt of the bank’s cash. To Levi, the details of such payoffs were “extremely significant,” starkly revealing “the complicity between politics and money, the hypocrisy and corruption at the top—the way the system really works in Spain.” Rodrigo Rato, former director of the International Monetary Fund and head of Bankia, steps into a car after a court hearing, Madrid, Spain, February 19, 2016. (Reuters / Juan Medina) Xnet Leaks facilitated access to Blesa’s e-mails through an online search engine so that journalists, researchers, lawyers, and citizens could discover the true story as narrated in e-mail exchanges between Bankia’s board of directors. Judge Andreu agreed to investigate the existence of the so-called “black cards” as part of the Bankia case, adding a third strand to his investigations. Opening this third front in Judge Andreu’s investigation, the Blesa e-mails, was possible once again due to the work of Levi and her network. In fact, former Bankia executives faced a deluge of court cases. From the moment Levi and 15 MpaRato announced its public campaign against Bankia, other serious allegations of corruption at the bank quickly floated to the surface; it was as if the genie was out of the bottle. One case, following the 15MpaRato’s initiative, was brought by one of Spain’s smaller political parties, Union, Progress, and Democracy (UPyD), and launched on July 4 2012. They accused 33 former Bankia executives (including Rato) of fraud, price-fixing, and falsifying accounts. The Spanish government itself started its investigation only after Xnet acted, announcing that it was launching a criminal investigation into Bankia in July 2012. And the Spanish Association of Minority Shareholder Listed Companies collected thousands of individual complaints from Bankia shareholders and launched a separate lawsuit against former directors for misinforming investors. There currently are other active lawsuits against Bankia, including one against Blesa and 20 others who are charged with fraud and other allegations related to the granting of mortgages between 2003 and 2009. Levi’s original idea hatched in a dark Barcelona bar a year before had triggered an avalanche of disclosures that revealed the rotten core of one of Spain’s largest banks. The law was closing in. Judge Andreu assigned liability for the credit-card abuse to Rato and Blesa, and in October 2014 the former bankers and accomplices had to put up their own property (a total of 19 million euros) in personal bail. Rato was ordered to pay a bond of 3 million euros. He was also forced to resign from the People’s Party. On April 16, 2015, Rato was briefly placed under arrest for alleged fraud, embezzlement, and money laundering—as a result of a separate investigation by another judge in a different court into suspected tax fraud, again triggered by the main case. According to information leaked to the Spanish media by court sources, he is reported to have amassed a personal fortune using a web of companies and over 70 bank accounts. The judge overseeing this investigation ordered the freezing of all Rato’s bank accounts, and in October 2015 his passport was confiscated. He denies wrongdoing, and this case also continues. In early 2016 there was another development in the Blesa-e-mails strand of the case. Judge Andreu and Spanish prosecutors filed charges against 66 individuals related to the case, demanding a jail sentence of four and a half years for Rato, six years for Blesa, and multimillion-euro fines for each. The trial opened a month ago on September 26; both deny wrongdoing, and this case continues, too. On February 17 of this year, Bankia announced it would refund hundreds of thousands of savers who lost most or all of their money because of the bank’s disastrous—and dubious—efforts to shore up its books five years before. This announcement followed quickly on the heels of a Supreme Court decision a few weeks earlier that Bankia had to return the money to two such customers because they had been “intentionally misled,” the court said, by the bank during its ill-fated IPO in 2011. The bank clearly saw the writing on the wall and, in an effort to avoid thousands of potentially expensive lawsuits, it has now offered an out of court settlement to the hundreds of thousands of others. The loss to these ordinary savers has been estimated to be close to 2 billion euros, and so far about 1.2 billion euros has been paid out. Thanks to the work of Simona Levi and a network of activists and supporters, hundreds of thousands of small savers are getting their money (plus interest) back, crooked bankers and even politicians may be jailed and systemic corruption exposed. As Simona Levi put it, “Bankia was a fraud, and we, the people are winning. None of the savers we worked with throughout these years has ever mentioned money, but it is important that we can help many people who have been scammed to recover what is their money, thanks to the evidence we have made available to all.” And who exactly will pay the bill of about nearly 2 billion euros to compensate savers? Bankia will stump up some of it, but the Spanish government still owns nearly two-thirds of Bankia’s equity. So Bankia’s wholly state-owned parent bank BFA will cover most of the bill. In short, the taxpayers of a country still severely affected by the crash and with an economy remaining far below pre-crisis levels will pay yet again—a fact Bankia’s new chairman likes to gloss over. Rafael Hilario Gomez, 41, celebrates with activists from the Mortgage Victims Platform (PAH) outside a branch of Bankia after learning that his eviction has been suspended, Madrid, Spain, September 13, 2013. (Reuters / Juan Medina) * * * For Simona Levi and other activists who worked on the Bankia case, all the targets in their five-year plan have been reached—or nearly reached—well ahead of schedule. But Levi says their work on this case is not yet over. For one, the cases have not been closed and they are watching proceedings in the Madrid courtroom very closely. Levi and her fellow activists would also like to see the regulators held responsible—but that would be an expensive venture. She believes the government itself should be called to account for the Bankia fiasco. As she says this to me she waves a hand dismissively and lets out a deep sigh. But then she smiles. There is also the unsettling thought of the millions of euros they could be liable for if they lose their case. Levi remains optimistic on that score and tries to focus on “the beautiful things we could do if we win and our costs are paid.” Levi continues to run projects and to teach, as before, and she is setting up a Master’s program in law because it has proved so difficult to find lawyers with the relevant training to work on the Bankia case. But what she is most focused on now is the play she wrote and is directing based on the Bankia saga. She is a theater director, after all. Levi told me that the story is Shakespearean and had to be given back to the citizens of Spain and elsewhere. The play’s title is Hazte Banquero—Become a Banker—a quote from an advertising slogan used by Bankia to flog its dodgy shares to its small savers. It opened in July and has been packing in audiences as it tours the country. An English version has been completed, and discussions are taking place about whether to proceed with a play or film. And, of course, Levi and her network continue to work on other cases—the e-mails keep coming in. The story of how a group of organized citizen activists brought a huge bank and key members of the Spanish elite to account is relevant to the ongoing debate about the role of the Internet in social change. For Xnet and 15 MpaRato activists the digital media are critical not only for communication and organization but a also as a way to effectively and securely link individual citizens with evidence of corruption—whistle-blowers, in effect—to journalists and to lawyers, in order to fight impunity and restore democracy. Simona Levi puts it this way: “By creating 15MpaRato, and lodging a complaint that moved the Bankia case forward, and a year later with the leak of Blesa’s e-mails, the documents that brought to light the ‘Bankia black credit cards’ scandal that involved all the political parties and main trade unions in Spain, we’ve learned many things. But one of them was completely unexpected: It isn’t so difficult to indict bankers and politicians. What is difficult is to communicate to a wider public that it wasn’t members of the elite that brought this case to court but normal, everyday people. Normal, everyday people can take on the banks and win.” 2 Comments Facebook Twitter Email Print Anne Koch Anne Koch is an expert on corruption.

"If you block immigrants, or even illegal immigrants working in the states, wages will rise. If you think about trade policy, if you block Chinese exports to the U.S. prices will rise." Expectations of higher inflation would in turn boost expectations that interest rates would climb, which would likely attract inflows into the U.S. dollar. Hui expected that the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates at its December meeting. That was likely to push up U.S. bond yields, helping to drive further flows into the dollar. Other analysts also said they expected higher U.S. rates and a stronger dollar. "December is baked in the cake," Ray Attrill, co-head of foreign-exchange strategy at National Australia Bank, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Monday. But Attrill added that the market appeared to only be pricing in around 45 basis points of Fed hikes though to the end of 2017, including the expected 25 basis-point increase next month.  "Given what's happening with inflation expectations, given what the bond market signal is there, if the market's half right about inflation expectations and inflation next year, then that is probably going to be the next shoe to drop as far as U.S. interest rates are concerned," he said. Attrill expected short-term interest rates would continue creeping higher, pulling the dollar along for the ride. In the wake of last week's election outcome, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield (US10Y) climbed above 2 percent from levels below 1.80 percent in the days before the result. "Seeing those shorter rates creeping higher, I think is something we should be braced for and that's something that brings in its wake a still firmer U.S. dollar," Attrill said. —By CNBC.Com's Leslie Shaffer; Follow her on Twitter@LeslieShaffer1 Go to MSN Home More in Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY Up Next 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from CNBC CNBC View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Rees, global head of equity strategy at JPMorgan Private Bank, said Trump's plan could be a major hurdle to bond proxies, or companies in industries like telecommunications and utilities, as well as parts of the consumer staples sector. "The companies that don't really grow that pay a high yield, those are the companies we want to avoid here," Rees told CNBC's "Squawk Box." Still, considering Trump's promises for significant tax reform, repatriation of capital and rebuilding infrastructure nationwide, Rees said there may be good opportunities for upside regardless of how quickly rates rise. "The market is definitely focusing on the pro-growth, positive parts of the plan," said Rees.

Privacy Policy. Submit Please enter a valid email address Economist Steven Ricchiuto had a slightly more cautious view of December's expected hike. He said the Federal Reserve could overreact and raise rates too quickly in response to the president-elect's massive spending proposals. "All I know about these moves is they tend to move quicker, they tend to move further than anyone anticipates, and they create a very, very good opportunity on the other side, and they do take [an] economic hostage along the way," the chief U.S. economist at Mizuho Securities told "Squawk Box." The economic hostage would be the U.S. budget deficit of $616 billion, which Ricchiuto said could affect long-term interest rates if Trump adds billions to it through his proposed infrastructure spending. "I'm going to accumulate cash, see what happens with the Fed in December, see what they tell us about 2017," Ricchiuto said.

The dollar, which is at its strongest in nearly a year, has been roaring higher since Republican Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election on November 8. That triggered a massive sell-off in Treasuries, with investors expecting Trump's policies to ramp up domestic inflation. MSCI's emerging market equity index slipped nearly 1 percent on the day and has tumbled nearly 7 percent since the U.S. election. Markets in Asia tallied up heavy losses and stocks in Turkey and Russia fell around 0.8 percent. The most widely used emerging market hard-currency bond index, JPMorgan's EMBI Global Diversified Index, showed the premium investors demanded over U.S. Treasuries widened 4 basis points. The index has risen nearly 20 basis points since the U.S. election. Currencies also weakened. The Mexican peso, which has become a lightning rod for market anxiety, slipped 1.5 percent against the dollar. Russia's rouble and the Turkish lira traded 1 percent weaker. “The general gist is that investors are trying to figure what he is going to do as president,” said Cristian Maggio, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities. “No one has a clear answer to that question. We don't expect all his pledges to be implemented.” Asian currencies fared little better. Malaysia's ringgit traded near 10-month lows and China's yuan slipped 0.5 percent after the central bank dropped the trading midpoint to its weakest rate since September 2009. Meanwhile, a raft of data pointed to a stabilisation in the world's second largest economy, though there were some clouds ahead. Fixed-asset investment quickened slightly and beat expectations in January-October as the government stepped up infrastructure spending to support growth. “China's economy is at risk with his election, in particular that (Trump) would want to label China a currency manipulator,” TD Securities' Maggio said. “This is going to add strains to trade and diplomatic relations.” Egypt's pound proved the exception, strengthening around 1 percent to just over 15 to the dollar after Cairo won International Monetary Fund approval late on Friday for a three-year, $12 billion bailout program aimed at reviving a struggling economy, bringing down public debt and controlling inflation. Across central and eastern Europe, currencies hovered broadly flat against the euro after having traded near or at multi-month lows on Friday. REUTERS Hungry for more business news?

Published Mon, Nov 14, 2016  |  David Dittman, Editorial Director Donald Trump shocked the world with his victory in the U.S. presidential contest. He’s about to shock voters with his Establishment-flavored personnel and policy priorities. As we noted in last Friday’s issue, Donald Trump recognized the requirement that to govern in the United States, first you have to win an election. And the work he did to put together a winning coalition is genius level. He basically flipped the Obama hope-and-change script, turning Florida, Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin from blue to red by stoking a mix of anger and fear. I’ve seen this expression already, as I’m sure many of you have, probably in some social media meme. It’s another monumental culture-referencing color change: Orange is indeed the new black. The mainstream media and a large segment of the electorate would say he’s an idiot-savant. Nevertheless, today he’s Mr. President-elect. No longer on the campaign trail, he’s now preparing to go inside the Beltway. And my, things have changed… again. Let’s start with a genuinely constructive — magnanimous, even — tweet the president-elect issued early last Friday morning, in the wake of multiple protests around the country: Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud! At the same time, some of Trump’s main people and major policies may surprise his most vocal partisans. Indeed, as Winston Churchill said to Joseph Stalin while discussing the Allied invasion of Europe during the 1943 Tehran Conference, “In wartime, truth is so precious that she should always be attended by a bodyguard of lies.” Nevertheless, today he’s Mr. President-elect. No longer on the campaign trail, he’s now preparing to go inside the Beltway. So, too, the way-cagier-than-we-thought Trump seems to be demonstrating, in politics. Voters pissed at the Establishment and anxious about a future when the recent past has already left them behind might be — should be — alarmed by at least one of the names floated for a top slot in this newest, most critical Trump corporation. It’s Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), late of American Express Co. (AXP) and Citigroup (C), once a potential nominee for Treasury Secretary in the first Obama administration, and now, according to CNBC, a potential nominee for Treasury Secretary in the first Trump administration. He’s a consummate Wall Street elitist — indeed, the capo di tutti capi (“boss of all bosses”) up there. Alan “Ace” Greenberg, the late Bear Stearns chairman and CEO and “one of the most illustrious Wall Street personalities of all time,” once said when asked about attempts to rein in Wall Street, “I feel about Dodd’s bill and the other legislation, exact how Jamie Dimon feels.” And how was that? “I don’t know, but however he feels is how I feel.” Warren Buffett wrote the foreword to Greenberg’s 1996 book, Memos From a Chairman, a collection of his famous notes to employees. He wrote, “Ace Greenberg does almost everything better than I do: bridge, magic tricks, dog training, arbitrage — all of the important things in life.” “If Alan represents me on something, nobody else is going to know about it. He’s extremely close-mouthed.” That was Donald Trump praising Greenberg, who attended the president-elect’s 1993 wedding to Marla Maples. Though he hasn’t passed through it (yet) himself, Dimon, who also served on the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, knows how to meet, greet, and treat those who travel the Wall Street-Washington, D.C., wormhole. Signs of a moderating appeared during Trump’s first moments in public as president-elect. He was stunningly gracious toward “Crooked” Hillary Clinton. And one of the first things he mentioned in his victory speech, from a policy perspective, was “infrastructure” — which, by the way, was a cornerstone of Clinton’s economic plan. Signs of a moderating appeared during Trump’s first moments in public as president-elect. “We are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals,” said Trump. “We’re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.” We’ll see how much of that gets through a Congress populated by “movement conservatives” fixed on “small government,” cutting spending, and managing a budget like a household must. But maybe those were only Obama-era principles. Still, combined with Trump’s commitment to cutting taxes and boosting defense spending, a top-of-mind focus on “highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals” spells more debt and bigger deficits. Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose. (“The more it changes, the more it’s the same thing.”) “Second to none” infrastructure, in addition to Trump’s items, should include an expanded effort to build a hack-proof quantum network. As we detailed in the October 31 Wall Street Daily column, China is making impressive progress toward such a communications system. According to the University of Waterloo Institute for Quantum Computing, “Quantum computing is essentially harnessing and exploiting the amazing laws of quantum mechanics to process information.” And it has the potential to neuter those who would perpetrate the types of cyber-attacks that crippled the internet on October 21 with a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on one of the largest Domain Name System (DNS) service providers in the world. It will help us secure the Internet of Things, which is expanding at an incredibly rapid pace and opening up vulnerabilities at a similarly incredible pace. Still, combined with Trump’s commitment to cutting taxes and boosting defense spending, a top-of-mind focus on “highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals” spells more debt and bigger deficits. It’s also a matter of national security, a way to harden communications infrastructure against nation-states, terrorists, and criminals who, in an era of “blended threats,” combine to penetrate government and corporate networks to do us harm. On top of what we reported on October 31, IEEE Spectrum reported on November 8 that researchers at MIT and Harvard have taken what may be another “significant step toward realizing quantum computing.” According to a paper published November 3 in the journal Science: The realization of large-scale fully controllable quantum systems is an exciting frontier in modern physical science. We use atom-by-atom assembly to implement a platform for the deterministic preparation of regular one-dimensional arrays of individually controlled cold atoms. In our approach, a measurement and feedback procedure eliminates the entropy associated with probabilistic trap occupation and results in defect-free arrays of over 50 atoms in less than 400 milliseconds. The technique is based on fast, real-time control of 100 optical tweezers, which we use to arrange atoms in desired geometric patterns and to maintain these configurations by replacing lost atoms with surplus atoms from a reservoir. This bottom-up approach may enable controlled engineering of scalable many-body systems for quantum information processing, quantum simulations, and precision measurements. The big leap forward here is that using “optical tweezers” enabled the use of neutral atoms, or atoms with no electrical charge. Qubit particles — until now the basis of quantum computing — are much easier to trap due to their charge. But neutral atoms can be placed closer together. And the MIT-Harvard team has also solved the problem of trapping them using a laser beam. As IEEE Spectrum notes: Once the atoms are trapped in this way, they begin to emit light, making it possible for a charged-coupled-device (CCD) camera to capture an image of it. From the images, the researchers were able to determine which of the laser beams had successfully captured an atom and which were empty. The researchers were able to essentially switch off those beams that did not have an atom by selecting certain radio frequencies. In those beams’ place, they put the ones with atoms, yielding a defect-free array of atoms. In this way, the researchers achieved a maximum of 50 atoms that were held in place for a few seconds. A neutral atom can complete 100,000 quantum operations per second. The next step is establishing quantum gates, or “logic operations that occur between two quantum bits that are similar to logic gates in regular computer circuits,” using neutral atoms. This would be a first. A guy like Donald Trump oughta be able to see the genius in all this. Upticks, Downticks Yes, it’s a (ridiculously) small sample size, but the Trump Era has so far been incredibly kind to small-cap stocks. The Russell 2000 has posted a 7.2% rally over the three trading days since it became clear that Donald Trump would win the presidency. The main small-cap index is now just 14 points away from its all-time high of 1,296. According to the November 8 U.S. Department of Labor’s Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) report, the seasonally adjusted layoff rate slipped to a record low of 1.474 million in September from 1.692 million in August and 1.842 million a year ago. But the hiring rate was also lower, at a seasonally adjusted 5.081 million, down from 5.268 million in August and 5.131 million a year ago. According to FactSet, as of November 11, with 91% of S&P 500 companies reporting, 71% have reported earnings above the mean estimate and 55% have reported sales above the mean estimate. The blended earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 is 2.9%. This is the first time the S&P 500 has posted year-over-year earnings growth since the first quarter of 2015. The Labor Department reported on November 10 that seasonally adjusted initial claims for unemployment insurance were down by 11,000 to 254,000 for the week ending November 5. Analysts were expecting 260,000. The University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment for November surged 5.0% from October to 91.6, its highest level since mid-2016, on an improved outlook for the economy. The Sentiment Index is 0.3% higher than it was a year ago. The Chicago Board of Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX), often cited as the “Fear Gauge,” has eased back to 14.74, a decline of 34.5% from a Friday, November 4, close of 22.51. The 2016 Presidential Election Campaign is over. The 2020 Presidential Election Campaign is just getting started. No more “First Lady Bill Clinton” jokes. No more “First Lady Bill Clinton” jokes.

Trump’s victory poses a major challenge to the conventional wisdom on the global economy, which for years has relied on brisker cross-border trade and migration flows for growth. Apart from a nearly across-the-board rise in sovereign bond yields, however, the markets have so far mostly shrugged off the election result — despite previous fears of a meltdown in the event of victory for Trump, who espoused fiercely protectionist positions on trade in his campaign. Even the long-held view that the Federal Reserve will raise rates next month, a year after its initial step in that direction, hasn’t budged at all. Fed Chair Janet Yellen’s testimony to Congress on Thursday may set the stage for a year-end hike, despite the mild tightening in financial conditions in the past week. Everything is up for reassessment. “It will take time to gauge the global economic consequences of Donald Trump’s surprise victory,” JP Morgan’s Chief Global Economist Bruce Kasman wrote in a note. “Forthcoming policy changes are likely to generate growth cross-currents, but they should reinforce the tilt towards global reflation.” Trump’s proposals represent both a negative supply shock from curbs on trade and immigration as well as a positive demand shock from new fiscal spending, he added. With the US economy close to full employment — the jobless rate was 4.9 per cent in October — Trump’s election promise to cut taxes and upgrade the country’s ageing infrastructure could provide a big boost to both growth and inflation. Official US data on Thursday will likely show consumer price index inflation picked up slightly last month, up 0.4 per cent on the month and 1.6 per cent on the same month last year. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy, is expected to hit 2.2 per cent. That follows pre-election news of a pickup in average pay growth to 2.8 per cent, the highest since June 2009. Retail sales data due out on Tuesday are expected to have lost a little steam last month. INFLATION AHOY Sovereign bond markets are already out of the blocks in pricing in a rise in inflation expectations in the United States followed by the rest of the world. The 10-year US yield rose to 2.15 per cent, almost 30 basis points above its levels around 1.86 per cent just before the US election on Tuesday. The surge has strengthened the dollar against the euro and yen, which would ultimately help raise import costs in the euro zone and Japan. If inflation moves higher from here, supported by fiscal stimulus and rising energy prices, the current back-up in bond yields across the developed world is set to continue, possibly suggesting an end to a three-decade trend of falling yields. It is still early days, however. Starting on Monday, it will become clearer how industrialized economies such as the euro zone, Germany, Italy, and Japan fared in the third quarter —before the US political earthquake. Reuters polls show growth largely held steady in the euro zone despite a slowdown in Germany, and picked up slightly in Japan. Inflation was probably 0.5 per cent in October in the euro area, similar to a preliminary reading but above recent lows. The gradual rise in inflation in recent months will be welcome news for the European Central Bank which, after printing more than a trillion euros since March 2015 and cutting deposit rates to -0.4 per cent, is fast seen running out of policy tools. The ECB’s Governing Council next meets on December 8 to decide policy. Economists expect it to extend its asset purchase programme beyond the planned end date of March 2017. YELLEN’S FUTURE A snap Reuters poll conducted in the 24 hours after the US election result indicated no change at all in the expected future path for the policy rate. A series of Fed policymakers are scheduled to speak in the coming week and are likely to reinforce the view that the fed funds rate will move up 25 basis points to a range of 0.50-0.75 at the December 13-14 meeting. Crucial too for the rate trajectory is the future of Janet Yellen, appointed by President Obama as Fed Chair. A Reuters poll a few days ago found a majority of economists expect Yellen to serve out the remainder of her term until early 2018 but don’t think she will be reappointed. “What is relatively clear is that there will be conflicts between a Trump administration and Fed Chair Janet Yellen after Trump had severely attacked Yellen in his election campaign. The bridges between both of them appear to have been burnt,” Jorg Kramer, Chief Economist at Commerzbank, wrote to clients. Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May is scheduled to travel to Berlin on November 18, a trip in which she possibly hopes to get preliminary talks underway that would help the UK smoothly navigate the process of leaving the European Union. — Reuters About the author View all articles by Oman Observer ← Gulf money won’t leave the United States after all Zain Saudi told to pay rival Mobily $58.5m by arbitration panel → ← Previous Next → Search Recent Posts Recent Oman welcomes Yemen ceasefire HM receives greetings from Fahd Higher Committee for Conferences meets Kerry concludes oman visit Read More ...

Sizing up foreign policy clues – Peter Vale Friends & Friction: We must exploit our business talent Rand set for biggest weekly slump since August Dollar’s Trump-inspired surge sets off intervention Emerging markets extend post-Trump slump Trump vow to crack down on China set to run into complex reality   New York - The selloff in emerging markets after Donald Trump’s US presidential election was intense. A closer look reveals that things aren’t as bad as they might seem. While local-currency bonds suffered their biggest losses last week since 2008 following the Republican’s surprise victory, a gauge of volatility in developing-market currencies remained 16% below the levels seen in February. The cost to hedge against foreign-exchange losses is 38% cheaper than it was in August 2015 when China’s yuan devaluation rattled global investors. In a global bond selloff fuelled by expectations that Trump will increase government spending, emerging-market traders are by no means capitulating. While bracing for the risks of protectionist policies, they’re betting faster growth and narrowing current account deficits will help most developing countries weather the rout. The recent declines have “created a great buying opportunity,” said Koon Chow, a strategist at Union Bancaire Privee Ubp SA in London. “We could get to the stage where, in one or two weeks’’ time, US Treasury yields stabilise, and if that happens, emerging markets will come back.” While it’s too early to call a bottom, Chow said domestic bonds in Brazil and Russia start to look attractive, together with the Colombian and Peruvian currencies. Asian exchange rates are likely to remain under pressure, he said. More than $1.2trn was wiped off the value of global bonds last week as Trump’s win bolstered the view that a government spending splurge may accelerate US growth and inflation.  Emerging markets were among the hardest-hit as the real-estate mogul pledged on the campaign trail to pull America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, brand China a currency manipulator and build a wall along the border with Mexico. Restrained selling Since the November 8 election, developing-nation local-currency bonds have tumbled 7.3% through November 11, the biggest three-day slump since October 2008. The decline cut the bonds’ return this year to 8.5%. Investors yanked a record $301m from BlackRock’s $8.9bn emerging-market fixed-income fund on November 10. In the currency market, Mexico’s peso plunged 12% to a record low while the Brazilian real and South Africa’s rand have lost more than 6%. The rand was trading 1.8% lower on Monday by 06:30 at R14.34/$. The selling also extended to Asia on Monday. The Malaysian ringgit sank 0.9% to a nine-month low and South Korea’s won depreciated 0.5% to the weakest since June. The Indonesian rupiah extended declines after falling as much as 3% on Friday, the most on an intraday basis since September 2013. Bank Indonesia said on Friday it was in the market to stabilise the rupiah, adding that outflows were moderate and it expects the slide to be temporary. Bank Negara Malaysia said the monetary authority’s role is to continue managing “extreme volatilities in the ringgit, with no targeted level.” Indian state-run banks sold dollars on behalf of the Reserve Bank, according to two Mumbai-based traders, who asked not to be identified. Still, there are indications that the selloff may be limited. While hedging costs in the currency market increased to a five-month high of 4.3% on Nov. 10, they were lower than those of 6.9% in August 2015, according to data compiled by JPMorgan Chase. At 11.3%, JPMorgan’s gauge of currency volatility is below this year’s high of 13.4% set in February. Stronger fundamentals One reason is that emerging countries are on a stronger footing now compared with three years ago during the so-called taper tantrum when then Federal Reserve chairperson Ben Bernanke’s signal to reduce monetary stimulus sent a shock wave through global markets. Developing-nation local-currency bonds lost about 16% in less than four months. Economic growth is picking up this year for the first time since 2010 with Brazil and Russia digging themselves out of recessions, the International Monetary Fund estimates. The average shortfall of current accounts in South Africa, Brazil, Turkey, India and Indonesia, a group branded as the “fragile five” by Morgan Stanley in 2013, has shrunk to 2.4% of gross domestic product, from a record 5% in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Foreign reserves have increased in countries including Indonesia and India, providing them with ammunition to defend their currencies. “Fundamentals are much stronger than going into the taper tantrum.” said  Paul McNamara, a money manager at GAM UK Ltd. The selloff “just strikes me as a little bit extreme,” he said. Strategists at Morgan Stanley and Citigroup warn that the rout is likely to deepen. Trump’s protectionist overtures, if acted upon, would slow exports from and reduce investments to developing markets, they say. In addition, central banks in the US, Europe and Japan are either ready to raise borrowing costs or stop easing further, dragging Treasuries yields up and putting pressure on emerging markets, Citigroup’s analyst Dirk Willer wrote in a note on Friday. Local debt in Mexico, Poland and Hungary are most vulnerable to rising US yields, he said. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that investors are overweighting domestic bonds and have hedged between about 10% and 30% of their currency exposure in Brazil, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa. If the selloff extends, investors may have to cut their holdings and increase their purchases of insurance, exacerbating the decline. For now, McNamara said he’s willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt. He’s looking to buy the South African rand once there’s some clarity about the direction of the new US government. “We just sit tight at the moment,” said McNamara, whose Julius Baer Local Emerging Bond Fund returned 13% this year. “All the negative is based on various assumptions. We’ve got very little hard evidence in terms of what the new administration is going to mean for emerging markets.” Follow Fin24 on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Pinterest. 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24.

Morgan AM&#039;s Tai Hui talks about how expectations for growth and rising inflation have increased in U.S. markets on Donald Trump&#039;s election.</p> How markets have reacted post-election    Sunday, 13 Nov 2016 | 6:23 PM ET | 01:08 The dollar was likely to continue its lurch higher in the wake of the surprise presidential election win by Donald Trump, as inflation was set for a comeback, analysts said. The dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, rose as high as 99.247 in early Asia trade on Monday, from levels below 97 in the days before the U.S. election, which Trump won. Analysts said the market was now pricing in the billionaire businessman's surprise win. "It is very much the market building up expectation or pricing in his election campaign language," Tai Hui, chief Asia market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Monday. "His bias in terms of policy from an economist's standpoint is very much inflation, inflation, inflation." "Infrastructure, deficit spending, protectionism, immigration reform; everything he's mentioned so far is going to push prices higher in the U.S.," Hui said. "If you block immigrants, or even illegal immigrants working in the states, wages will rise. If you think about trade policy, if you block Chinese exports to the U.S. prices will rise." show chapters <p>December rate hike is &#039;baked in the cake&#039;: Expert</p> <p>National Australia Bank&#039;s Ray Attrill and J.P. Morgan AM&#039;s Tai Hui discuss why they think the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates in December.</p> December rate hike is 'baked in the cake': Expert    Sunday, 13 Nov 2016 | 6:48 PM ET | 01:46 Expectations of higher inflation would in turn boost expectations that interest rates would climb, which would likely attract inflows into the U.S. dollar. Hui expected that the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates at its December meeting. That was likely to push up U.S. bond yields, helping to drive further flows into the dollar. Other analysts also said they expected higher U.S. rates and a stronger dollar. "December is baked in the cake," Ray Attrill, co-head of foreign-exchange strategy at National Australia Bank, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Monday. But Attrill added that the market appeared to only be pricing in around 45 basis points of Fed hikes though to the end of 2017, including the expected 25 basis-point increase next month. Alexander Ryumin | TASS | Getty Images "Given what's happening with inflation expectations, given what the bond market signal is there, if the market's half right about inflation expectations and inflation next year, then that is probably going to be the next shoe to drop as far as U.S. interest rates are concerned," he said. Attrill expected short-term interest rates would continue creeping higher, pulling the dollar along for the ride. In the wake of last week's election outcome, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield climbed above 2 percent from levels below 1.80 percent in the days before the result. "Seeing those shorter rates creeping higher, I think is something we should be braced for and that's something that brings in its wake a still firmer U.S. dollar," Attrill said. —By CNBC.Com's Leslie Shaffer; Follow her on Twitter @LeslieShaffer1 Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Finance Search Wed, Nov 16, 2016, 12:10 PM AEDT - Australia Markets close in 3 hrs 50 mins Bank post-poll rally may be just appetizerAAP – Mon, Nov 14, 2016 9:51 AM AEDT Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print The US banking sector's dramatic rally post election day is likely just a taste of bigger gains to come, as investors expect banks to reap huge benefits from rising interest rates and lighter regulation under a Donald Trump presidency. In recent years, bank stocks have been held back by heavy regulation and historically low interest rates which have sapped the earnings potential of their massive cash holdings. But optimism about the sector's outlook is growing. Interest rates are rising and investors are betting that Trump will follow through on his campaign promise to review the increased number of regulations put on the banking system after it nearly keeled over in the 2008 financial crisis. The S&P 500 bank subsector rose 10.2 per cent in the three days following Trump's victory in the US presidential election. This was the index's best three-day performance since August 2009. In those three days, Wells Fargo Co shares rose 13.6 per cent, JPMorgan Chase & Co climbed 9.5 per cent and Bank of America gained 11.9 per cent. Some investors and analysts watching banks say the stocks are likely not near the end of their run. "They are not close to being expensive yet," said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. The S&P 500 banks are currently trading at about 11.2 times forward earnings estimates as a group, up from about nine times in February, when the index hit its lowest since May 2013. Valuation is still well off peak levels of over 33 times earnings estimates in May of 2009, though it trades near levels seen between 2002 and 2008, before many current regulations were put in place. If rates continue to rise and the Trump administration gives some clarity on how regulations will change, then bank valuations "certainly can move higher," Piper Jaffray analyst Kevin Baker said. Baker stopped short of giving a specific P/E estimate but he pointed to the higher valuations of banks that are not designated as systemically important financial institutions, commonly referred to as "too big to fail". Today, the minimum asset threshold for too-big-to-fail designated banks is $US50 billion. If this threshold is lifted to $US250 billion in a regulatory overhaul it would give a lot more flexibility that could likely boost valuations of banks operating in that range, Baker said. Valuations for too-big-to-fail designated banks are at around 12.5 times forward earnings compared with multiples of 13 to 15 for banks outside of this category, according to Baker. Ed Keon, managing director and portfolio manager of QMA, a multi-asset manager owned by Prudential Financial, said he has been buying into the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, the ETF that tracks the S&P financial sector, in the last couple of weeks. He is betting on higher interest rates and a pick-up in economic growth. The potential for lighter regulation added to his enthusiasm for the sector. "Of course, no one yet knows exactly what policy changes will occur and exactly how much they will help profits, but I think the benefit might be solid enough that I am maintaining my overweight holdings in the sector," Keon said. @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Macdonald quits Big W after just 10 monthsAAP Woolworths shares have slipped after it announced retail expert Sally Macdonald's resignation as Big W chief executive … Wages rose 0.4% in September quarterAAP Domino's hails 'world's first' drone pizzaAAP Trump links off to good start: TurnbullAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7545 -0.0007 -0.09% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.6056 -0.0009 -0.15% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.7025 -0.0015 -0.21% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Socceroos Currency Converter HMAS Darwin NZ Home loans Carrie Fisher Mortgage calculator Dwayne Johnson Budget Rent a Car WGEA pay gap Free iTunes download Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

"Following" : "Follow"}} November 13, 2016 2:59pm   Comments Share: This weekend's Barron's takes a look at the expected winners and losers following Donald Trump's election victory. The prospects for a leading biotechnology product development company and a prominent financial services company are also examined. Other featured stories offer where Jeffrey Gundlach sees bond yields going and more on what to expect in the Trump era. "Trump Win Creates Winners, Losers" by Andrew Bary says that Wall Street quickly decided that Trump's surprise election victory was good for business. See why Barron's thinks JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) are among the winners, while the likes of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ) are not. In "For-Profit Colleges Could Prosper Under Trump," Bill Alpert points out that investors have bid up shares of DeVry Education Group Inc (NYSE: DV), Capella Education Company (NYSE: CPLA) and others, on hopes for reduced regulations. See why the industry, a longtime underperformer, is giving high marks to a Trump presidency. Jack Hough's "Thermo Fisher Has 30% Upside" examines why, even though this biotechnology product development company has beaten earnings for 20 quarters in a row, its shares are valued no higher than other serial disappointers. Find out why Barron's believes Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE: TMO) is likely to grow its earnings per share at a double-digit clip for years to come. If Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) can grow its loan book just a little bit faster, the shares could offer a 12 percent return within the next year, according to "Discover: A Credit-Card Stock With a Rewards Program for Investors" by Robin Goldwyn Blumenthal. And if interest rates rise, says the article, Discover looks even more like a winner going forward. In Jack Hough's "10 Stocks Set to Win Big With Trump Tax Cuts," takes a look at companies that have gotten clobbered by taxes, such as Altria Group Inc (NYSE: MO), CVS Health Corp (NYSE: CVS) and CSX Corporation (NASDAQ: CSX). If rates slide, says Barron's, the earnings of these companies and more could soar and their shares could rally.

(BENJAMIN NORMAN/NYT) Not only did they not foresee a win by Donald Trump, they predicted that if it occurred the market would take a bath. In the short term, investors have disagreed. Share story By James B. Stewart The New York Times To the long list of pundits who called the election all wrong — as well as its likely consequences — add Wall Street analysts. As the presidential election approached, they were falling all over themselves to predict a Hillary Clinton victory and, afterward, a modest stock-market rally. The prospect of a win by Donald Trump was so remote as to be deemed a “black swan,” an event that was only distantly possible but would have potentially dire consequences for financial markets. Among the many predicting a drop in equity markets in the unlikely event of a Trump victory were analysts at Citibank, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. Keith Parker, head of cross-asset strategy research at Barclays, forecast a drop of 11 to 13 percent in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. The hedge fund Bridgewater Associates went even further, warning clients that the Dow Jones industrial average would fall 2,000 points.

But then, not only did Trump win, but U.S. stocks rose sharply. With benefit of hindsight, what’s extraordinary is how few professional investors saw it coming. Trump was derided as the candidate of “uncertainty,” which markets abhor, and many of his stated policies are vague, incoherent or inconsistent. But there was nothing uncertain about his overall pro-growth, pro-business and America-first tendencies, now backed by the firepower of a Republican House and Senate. “We see tremendous opportunity for economic growth,” said John Engler, a former governor of Michigan who is now president of the Business Roundtable, an influential group of chief executives often at odds with Trump during the campaign, especially over trade and immigration. Silver lining Now that the results are in, though, Engler sees a silver lining. “The Republicans understand,” he said, “that they’re on the spot to produce results.” Simon Lack, founder of SL Advisors, an investment-advisory firm and operator of a mutual fund that focuses on energy, carried the theme further. “Trump’s win is unambiguously positive” for many sectors of the economy, “especially energy infrastructure,” he said. The doomsayers also ignored a century of market reactions to presidential elections. “We’ve done extensive research that suggests presidential elections don’t affect markets,” said James Stack, president of InvesTech Research. “The reality is that the market is influenced to the greatest extent by economic factors and monetary policy.” “In almost all technical and macro aspects, this is still a bull market,” Stack said, and Trump’s election does not change that. Markets generally rally the day after a presidential election, said Jeffrey Hirsch, editor of the Stock Traders Almanac, because elections, whatever their outcome, eliminate a measure of uncertainty. “It doesn’t matter if it’s a Republican or Democrat.” Returns tend to be higher when an incumbent president is replaced or the party in power changes. And previous instances of the election of both a Republican president and Republican Congress have been followed, on average, by a first-year performance of 14 percent. There are more specific reasons as well that investors applauded Trump’s victory During the campaign, Trump said he wanted to “build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, seaports and airports.” If he can get his Republican Congress to go along, that could easily surpass President Obama’s stimulus plan in the depths of the recession. Trump has not put a price tag on his proposals, but suggested it could easily top $500 billion. Economists generally agree that government spending can act as a broad economic stimulus as well as a boon for construction companies. The Congressional Budget office estimated that Obama’s stimulus plan saved 2.1 million jobs in the last quarter of 2009, bolstering the economy by up to 3.5 percent and lowering the unemployment rate by as much as 2.1 percent. Construction-company stocks rallied Wednesday. Shares in Caterpillar, which makes the heavy equipment used in most infrastructure construction, jumped more than 8 percent. With Republicans in charge, the kind of sweeping tax overhaul and tax cuts long sought by investors seem likely. In many instances, Trump’s proposed tax cuts go even further than those advanced by House Republicans. He wants to cut the top rate on individuals to 33 percent and cut the corporate rate and taxes on so-called pass-through entities like limited-liability companies and partnerships to 15 percent. Economic stimulua Whatever their ultimate effect on deficits and interest rates — not to mention worsening income inequality — tax cuts are another form of economic stimulus. “Tax modernization is our top priority,” said Engler, of the Business Roundtable, arguing that it would substantially lift the economy a full percentage point beyond the growth rate of roughly 2 percent a year that it has been stuck in. “We’ve said that if you want to grow gross domestic product by 1 percent, get tax legislation done. The House Republican plan is a great blueprint. One percent growth over 10 years would be $3 trillion.” Investors and business leaders cheered the likely rollback of a host of time-consuming and costly regulatory measures: crucial parts of the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul legislation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, environmental regulations and labor protections. “Dodd-Frank has made it impossible for bankers to function,” Trump said during the campaign. Needless to say, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a Wall Street nemesis whom Trump mocked as “Pocahontas,” will not have a starring role in a Trump administration. Some of the biggest beneficiaries of deregulation are likely to be banks, drug companies and oil and gas pipelines. On Wednesday, shares in JPMorgan Chase rose 4.6 percent, biotech concern Biogen jumped more than 8 percent and pipeline operator Kinder Morgan rose 4.5 percent. Whether the “Trump rally” persists is another question. In their rush to buy stocks, investors seemed all too willing to ignore Trump’s hostile stands on immigration and free trade, as well as his seeming indifference to the federal deficit and the increased likelihood of higher interest rates. All those have the capacity to dampen growth or even tip the economy into recession. Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, was among those surprised by the strong market rally. “If we get a large stimulus on top of a full-employment economy,” he said, “it may give you some juice in the near term, but longer term, it’s going to hurt” by driving up interest rates and squeezing out other investments. “I was a strong advocate of deficit spending and tax cuts when unemployment was at 10 percent,” he said. “It doesn’t make sense at 5 percent.” Parker, of Barclays, said he had expected a sell-off initially, but also called for a recovery by year-end once investors absorbed signals from key economic policymakers. “What we thought would play out over weeks played out over hours,” he said, pointing to Trump’s victory speech, which made no mention of trade or immigration, as one catalyst. Like many, Parker now sees more gains for stocks if a Trump administration stays focused on a tax overhaul and fiscal policy, if real interest rates stay low and if inflation picks up. “The backdrop was and still is generally supportive of risk,” he said.

Yes No View Results  Loading ... @MedicineHatNews Follow Us By Alex Veiga, The Associated Press on November 10, 2016. Money traders watch a news program reporting the U.S. presidential election results at a foreign exchange brokerage in Tokyo, Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016. (AP Photo/Shizuo Kambayashi) 00000 Banks and other financial companies led U.S. stocks mostly higher in early trading Thursday, building on a strong rally the day before in the wake of the election of Donald Trump as the next U.S. president. Health care and industrial stocks were also big gainers, while safe-haven assets like utilities and phone companies slumped. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 122 points, or 0.7 per cent, to 18,712 as of 10:24 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gained 2 points, or 0.1 per cent, to 2,165. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 27 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 5,223. TRUMP BOUNCE: The upcoming Trump presidency, which will commence on Jan. 20, put many investors in a buying mood, giving many global stock indexes a lift early Thursday. Traders were focusing on Trump’s promises to boost U.S. economic growth through infrastructure spending and by cutting red tape, rather than uncertainties such as what he might do with trade agreements. Before the election, markets had been worried about a Trump presidency because his campaign promises carried few policy details, making him an unknown quantity compared with rival Hillary Clinton. BANKS SURGE: Several big banks were moving higher amid speculation that a Trump presidency could result in higher interest rates and less government regulation, which tend to benefit banks and other financial stocks. JPMorgan Chase climbed $3.10, or 4.3 per cent, to $76.38, the highest gainer in the Dow. Goldman Sachs rose $4.13, or 2.1 per cent, to $196.73. BETTER QUARTER: Macy’s rose 3.7 per cent after the department store chain raised its sale outlook for the year, citing improved business in the third quarter. The stock gained $1.42 to $39.80. BONDS: The sell-off in bonds continued, sending bond prices lower and kicking up the yield on the 10-year Treasury note to 2.12 per cent from 2.06 per cent late Wednesday. That yield is a benchmark used to set interest rates on many kinds of loans including home mortgages. Traders have been selling bonds more aggressively to hedge against the possibility that interest rates, which have been ultra-low for years, could rise steadily again under Trump’s administration. MARKETS OVERSEAS: In Europe, Germany’s DAX was up 0.2 per cent, while the CAC-40 in France was 0.3 per cent higher. Britain’s FTSE 100 was down 0.7 per cent. Russia was one of the biggest gainers in Europe amid optimism there that Trump’s election will improve relations. The Micex index in Moscow was up 3.4 per cent. In Asia, shares posted hefty gains as they responded to the optimism recorded in Europe and the U.S. the day before. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index was the standout performer, rocketing 6.7 per cent after sliding more than 5 per cent the day before. South Korea’s Kospi advanced 2.3 per cent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 1.9 per cent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 surged 3.3 per cent. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude was down 66 cents, or 1.5 per cent, at $44.61 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, was down 31 cents, or 0.7 per cent, at $46.05 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar has been fairly solid since Trump’s victory. The U.S. currency rose to 106.81 yen from 105.84 on Wednesday. The euro was down to $1.0878 from $1.0930. The Mexican peso recouped some losses after plunging against the dollar Wednesday. The dollar weakened to 20.59 Mexican pesos from 19.87 pesos, which was still near its lowest level in decades. The Mexican currency has been in a slump as traders look ahead to potential problems under a Trump presidency. He has repeatedly said he wants a wall built to keep illegal Mexican immigrants out of the United States and has threatened to tear up a North American trade agreement. 00000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

The result: it gives these small banks the ability to give out small home and business loans for areas that are being gentrified, so Black families don’t get pushed out and their businesses can thrive. _ Killer Mike The Top Largest and oldest running banks in the United Stated are: JPMorgan Chase Bank of America Wells Fargo Citigroup Goldman Sachs Wells Fargo is number one in the world and Chase is number 3. How many of us have any financial assets in the banks listed here? Most of us! Not one of them is Black owned! You always hear people talking about investing in the community and letting money circulate as a way to strengthen neighborhoods but did you know that doing this isn’t actually that hard? It turns out that there are already over 35 African-American owned banks and credit unions in the United States where you can put your money if you find these type of efforts for financial stability and reinvestment in the black community important. Currently African American owned banks have assets totaling over $4 billion or approximately 0.43 percent of African America’s $1.1 trillion in buying power. Historically, Black-owned banks were important institutions in the African-American community that provided loans and services to Blacks when white institutions refused. Black banks allowed African-Americans to progress economically by allowing them to obtain loans to purchase homes and start businesses. Today, these banks remain relevant for many of the same reasons, but have been edged out by fierce competition from corporate rivals and economic losses brought on by the recession. Here are four imperative reasons why Black Banks are relevant:   Jobs – Creates more jobs for African-Americans. We need black financial planners and bankers who can understand our needs and help our people in making smarter financial decisions. Growth of Black Business – Doing business with black banks keeps black businesses alive. With more black banks opened more loans can be issued to fund black businesses. Accountability – Creates financial accountability and awareness. We need to utilize one another in regards to saving and spending habits. Generational Wealth – It helps build wealth in the community.   Despite the challenges facing Black financial institutions, there is room for growth, which makes the future for Black banks optimistic. Teri Williams, CEO of OneUnited, the largest Black owned bank in the U.S states, “As a community we need to invest in technology, which OneUnited has done, and the importance of technology is not just a Black bank issue, it is a community bank issue. Integration became an issue for Black banks 20 years ago. Today it is a different issue. There are opportunities and challenges today. OneUnited is attracting black customers from across the country. You can open an account with us anywhere in the 50 states. We have customers all over, because we have the technology where you can open an account wherever you are. You can even pay people by text,” the bank president noted. “Really for us what is happening today is fueling our growth, but if you are a small bank and you don’t have that technology–and that’s Black or white–then you’re losing business. Black people just happen to have more of those small banks.” For a list of Black Banks owed in your area click the link http://blackoutcoalition.org/black-u-s-banks/ Staff Writer; Amber Ogden One may also view more of her work over at; AmberOgden.com.

Tech stocks continue getting beaten up while the financial and real estate sectors performed best today. WTI crude oil for December delivery settled at $43.49 a barrel, up 0.2% for the day after dropping to $42.20 earlier in the day. December gold dropped 0.2% on the day to settle at $1,221.70.

The DJIA and the S&P 500 are trading less than 0.1% on either side of the break-even line, so the final tally could be different after the bell rings. The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Monday was UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE: UNH) which traded up 4.12% at $152.45. The stock’s 52-week range is $107.51 to $152.92, and the high was posted late this afternoon. Trading volume was 30% above the daily average of around 3.4 million.

The stock’s 52-week range is $52.50 to $80.44, a new high set earlier this morning. Volume was about 2.5 times the daily average of around 15.4 million shares. Another good day for financial stocks.

Stocks are opening modestly higher on Wall Street, led by gains in banks as interest rates continue to rise. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)(Credit: AP) NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are slightly lower Monday as technology companies like Apple and Microsoft take big losses on fears about their overseas revenue. That’s canceling out huge gains for banks, which are trading higher as bond yields rise to their highest levels since January. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average gained 12 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,859 as of noon Eastern time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 2 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,162. The Nasdaq composite sank 21 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,215. TECH TROUBLES: Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple gave up $3.31, or 3.1 percent, to $105.12 while Facebook declined $4.36, or 3.7 percent, to $114.66 and Microsoft slid $1.23, or 2.1 percent, to $57.80. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $22.47, or 2.9 percent, to $749.28. Tech stocks have struggled over the last few days as investors wonder if Donald Trump’s policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. BANK BONANZA: Bank stocks continued to surge, as they’ve done since the election. Higher bond yields point to higher interest rates and bigger profits for banks from lending money. Investors have been selling bonds, pushing yields higher, as they expect the spending plans of president-elect Trump to lead to higher inflation. Investors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. Trump’s election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Bank of America rose 97 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $19.99 and JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.55, or 3.3 percent, to $79.24. DOING DEALS: South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes products for connected cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.35, or 25.5 percent, to $110. MENTORING: German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor’s stock rose $5.67, or 18.5 percent, to $36.35. DIG IT: Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.67, or 14.4 percent, to $13.33 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it’s too low. Belden stock added $1.69, or 2.4 percent, to $71.39. BONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.22 percent. Bond trading was closed Friday for the U.S. Veterans’ Day holiday. The 10-year yield, which is a benchmark for interest rates on home mortgages and other kinds of loans, finished at 2.06 percent on Thursday. The day before the Nov. 8 presidential election the yield was 1.83 percent. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose sharply against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.36 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0719 from $1.0845. ENERGY: With the dollar gaining strength, benchmark U.S. crude fell $1.12, or 2.6 percent, to $42.29 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost $1.11, or 2.5 percent, to $43.64 a barrel in London. That pulled energy companies lower. Anadarko Petroleum fell $1.87, or 3.1 percent, to $59.17 and Exxon Mobil lost $1.24, or 1.4 percent, to $84.43. DIVIDEND PAYERS DIVE: Investors are also selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. Phone and utility companies and real estate investment trusts all traded lower. Those stocks are most appealing to investors when bond yields are low. American Tower fell $4.72, or 4.5 percent, to $100.99 and Duke Energy lost 80 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $74.44. TRUMP FACTOR: Stocks went into a long skid as the presidential campaign came to its conclusion, but in the last few days stocks have risen as investors hope a Trump presidency will mean cutbacks in regulations that affect energy and banks, among other businesses. The Dow has reached record highs, with the biggest recent gains going to financial firms Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, machinery maker Caterpillar and drug company Merck. OVERSEAS: France’s CAC 40 was up 0.4 percent and Germany’s DAX rose 0.3 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 0.4 percent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 percent after a strong reading on Japan’s economic growth. The dollar has been particularly strong against the Japanese yen lately and that’s helped the country’s exporters. Most other Asian markets fell. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent. ____ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay More Marley Jay.

 Stock markets are predicting disaster in London property prices post-Brexit Oscar Williams-Grut Nov. 11, 2016, 3:53 AM 1,321 facebook linkedin twitter email print Lightning strikes near a church in south London. Lewis Whyld PA Archive/PA Images An Irish property tycoon says London's property market is "tanking by the day" in the wake of Brexit, with financial markets forecasting the second biggest ever collapse in the value of office and retail space in the capital. Scott Crowe, Chief Investment Strategist at CenterSquare, told Business Insider that financial markets are pricing in a 15% collapse in the value of commercial real estate in London as a result of the Brexit vote. Bloomberg reports on Friday that Stephen Vernon, chairman of Green Property, said at a conference that London property values are collapsing, creating a potentially "fantastic" buying opportunity. Green Property, which made a fortune selling Irish property before the bubble collapsed in 2008, has closed its London office for now and is waiting for prices to go lower before re-entering the market. Crowe told Business Insider: "We've gone back and we've looked at every single real estate correction in the last three decades in the UK. What the market is pricing in now is the second worst correction in commercial real estate prices after the great financial crisis. It's on par with the commerical real estate downturn that we actually saw in the early 1990s." CenterSquare is the real asset arm of US bank BNYMellon, with approximately $10 billion (£7.9 billion) in assets under management. Crowe says his view is stock markets are "over discounting" the fall in London office and shop space value. He says: "What we're seeing right now is the market is forecasting a 15% plus decline in real estate values, which we think is unrealistic. "We think rent is probably going to fall 5-10%, but mitigating that is two things. The first is the fact gilts have come in since Brexit making real estate debt costs cheaper. Certainly, capital availability from the banks for commercial real estate hasn't changed, so that's supportive of valuations. And secondly, the pound has also corrected by 15%. The pound and gilts are really going to be the shock absorbers for the market, even though office rents, particularly City office rents, are likely to correct. "So what we expect is a single digit decline, something like 5%, in commercial real estate values. That all sets up to make the UK REIT market relatively cheap, particularly on a global basis." CenterSquare has $1.5 billion (£1.1 billion) invested in European Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), with about half of that in the UK. Stock markets hate uncertainty and they always over discount it. That's where you have an opportunity as an active manager. London-focused REIT Great Portland Estates is down over 18% since the June 23 referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union, while Derwent London is down over 27%. Crowe says: "If you look at the evidence to date, it certainly supports our point of view. We had about two weeks of stress — some of the open-ended property funds had to put gates up, close the fund, and sell some assets. Those assets came on the market at a maximum of about 10% discount to prior valuation. They were scooped up very, very quickly by large institutional buyers. We really haven't seen any more selling since that two weeks of distress." At least nine UK-focused investment firms suspended trading in their property funds or market down prices in July, freezing £15 billion ($19.4 billion) of assets. It came after panicked investors rushed to withdraw money in the wake of the Brexit vote. Funds were forced to hold a fire sale to raise funds to pay back investors. But Crowe points out that inflows recently turned positive for the first time since the vote, meaning investors are note putting more money into UK property than they are withdrawing. Much of the decline in London-focused property stocks and funds has been driven by a fear that the capital is about to lose its status as the financial capital of Europe. EU officials have repeatedly signalled that Britain can't keep financial passporting rights unless it accepts Freedom of Movement, something that is seen as highly unlikely. 5,500 British firms with a combined turnover £9 billion ($11.3 billion) rely on passporting to sell services and products to Europe, according to the FCA. The loss of passporting rights would therefore likely lead to the loss or relocation of thousands of jobs out of the UK. JPMorgan, UBS, and the head of the British Bankers Association (BBA) have all publically warned this is the case and Goldman Sachs is said to be considering relocating as many as 2,000 jobs. France and Germany have also been publicly wooing finance firms to get them to relocate. Crowe is sceptical. He says: "If they took 10% of the financial industry in London and put it in Frankfurt, they'd almost double the size of the industry there. There's almost no other city in Europe that has the scale. Paris is not going to be the next financial capital of Europe. The labour laws in Europe are a barrier for people setting up headquarters of investment banks in these countries. "London's not going to go away but it is going to be diminished slightly. Some of these jobs are going to move to Europe." He says that investors seem to have "thrown out with the bathwater" when it comes to property prices in London's West End, saying: "I think the West End is going to be much more resilient than the City." Shaftesbury, which owns 14 acres of the West End, fell 13% the day after the Brexit vote but has since rallied. Is it still around 3% lower than its pre-vote peak, however. Crowe says: "Stock markets hate uncertainty and they always over discount it. That's where you have an opportunity as an active manager. I don't know when the stock prices revert to their underlying fair value but I know they will. It's a question of when not if."

Trivago said it planned to offer American depositary shares (ADSs), representing Class A shares of its affiliate, travel B.V. A portion of the ADSs will be issued and sold by the company and a portion by certain shareholders, the company said. The selling shareholders include Trivago's founders. In 2012, Expedia paid 477 million euros ($531 million) for a 62 percent stake in Trivago. Expedia, which is not selling any ADSs, and its affiliates will hold Class B shares after the IPO, the company said. Expedia Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi told investors in July that management and Trivago's founding team had agreed to an IPO to value Trivago as a standalone company. Monday's filing did not reveal how many shares the company planned to sell or their expected price. Trivago plans to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol "TRVG." JPMorgan Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs & Co and Morgan Stanley & Co LLC are the underwriters to the offering. The amount of money a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filings is used to calculate registration fees. The final size of the IPO could be different.

(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images) NEW YORK — Mary Jo White, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, announced Monday that she will step down two years before the end of her term, clearing the way for President-elect Donald Trump to reshape the way Wall Street is regulated. The SEC, which polices Wall Street and the financial markets, has been a key part of the Obama administration’s effort to rein in big banks following the 2008 financial crisis and prevent future taxpayer bailouts of the industry. The agency has pushed for more oversight of hedge funds and other asset managers and has established rules that make it more difficult for big banks to make risky bets on the markets. White, a former federal prosecutor, is known for a no-nonsense style and beefed up the agency’s enforcement efforts over the last three years, pushing for more companies to admit guilt and taking more cases to trial. But progressive Democrats were often critical of her efforts, complaining they did not go far enough. White was widely expected to step down no matter who won the election to allow the next president to appoint their own chair. Trump has already indicated he would usher in a period of deregulation, including dismantling 2010’s financial reform legislation, known as the Dodd-Frank Act. He appointed Paul Atkins, an industry veteran, who has called Dodd-Frank a “calamity,” to lead the agency’s transition. Atkins “is a guy in general who wants to let companies do their thing and not get in the way very much,” Ian Katz, a financial policy analyst with the research firm Capital Alpha Partners, said of Atkins. “You would see a lighter touch on enforcement and a lighter hand on corporate governance issue broadly.” Atkins served as an SEC commissioner for six years during the President George W. Bush administration. He could not immediately be reached for comment. In addition to replacing White, Trump will be able to fill two openings on the five-member commission. Trump could also choose to ignore the more than 20-year-old tradition of allowing the opposing political party to pick its own representative on the commission, one industry official said, further bolstering his influence over the agency. Also, Thomas Curry, the head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, another important Wall Street regulator, has less than six months on his term. Together, the openings should give the Trump administration wide latitude to change the way Wall Street is regulated.  “It is a game-changer at the SEC. The commission is going to have a very different agenda over the next four years than it would have,” said Edward Mills, a policy analyst at investment bank FBR Capital Markets. “In the long-term, it is going to be a big tilt towards free markets.” White took office with high expectations. The SEC had long suffered under the popular notion that it was a slow, toothless tiger. White appeared to be someone who might change that reputation. Prior to her appointment, she had been a federal prosecutor who took on the terrorists behind the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 and the Mafia boss John Gotti. “You don’t want to mess with Mary Jo,” President Obama proclaimed while announcing her nomination in 2013. In June 2016, Sen. Elizabeth Warren and SEC chair Mary Jo White faced off during a Senate Banking Committee hearing. (C-SPAN) White moved quickly to set a new tone at the agency. Soon after taking office, she announced that the SEC would begin requiring more companies to admit guilt as part of their settlements with the agency. It was a break from the SEC’s nearly 100-year history of extracting monetary penalties from companies, which typically would neither admit nor deny the charges lodged against them.  “The SEC had more leverage than it realized,” White said in a recent interview. Not requiring admissions of guilt could “undermine, at least, the perception of the strength of a settlement, the strength of its deterrence. In certain cases that public accountability, I think, is very important.” Critics would later complain that many large banks were still able to settle SEC cases without admitting guilt and that the agency’s toughest actions were reserved for smaller banks. The SEC also poured resources into improving its technical capabilities, hiring experts who could help it better track stock trading and catch fraud. The SEC’s technical capabilities have “really been transformed over the last three years,” White said. There have been several cases, including some involving insider trading, that would have been impossible without these advancements, she said. Examinations of trading patterns that used to take months can now be done in hours, she said. But in the years since, the SEC has also been overwhelmed by the task of implementing dozens of rules called for under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law and the 2012 JOBS Act, which aims to make it easier for small businesses to raise money. The 4,000-person agency has tussled repeatedly with Congress and complained that as Wall Street became more complex it needed a bigger budget to keep up. White ultimately became a target of progressive groups that questioned her resolve to crack down on Wall Street. In addition to serving as a prosecutor, White also spent years defending big banks, including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, as a white-collar lawyer, they noted. And while White trumpeted that she had secured settlements with nearly 90 high-level executives for financial-crisis related misdeeds, critics noted that officials at some of the country’s largest banks had emerged largely unscathed. Last year, CREDO Action, a liberal advocacy group, sent a  “Dump (Mary Jo) Truck” around D.C. to mark the anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Courtesy: CREDO Action Another group put up billboards in the D.C. Metro system depicting White as a superhero missing in action and asking “Where is Mary Jo White?” White’s unpopularity among some progressive Democrats was particularly pronounced when she found herself the target of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). In January, Warren issued a report arguing that U.S. companies get away with crimes that regular people don’t because of weak enforcement. The SEC “is particularly feeble, often failing to use the full range of its enforcement toolbox,” the report said. Then in June, Warren and White faced off during a Senate Banking Committee hearing. “A year ago I called your leadership at the SEC extremely disappointing,” Warren said. “Today I am more disappointed than ever.” White quipped: “I’m disappointed in your disappointment.” But White’s supporters, including many industry officials, say the criticism has been unwarranted. “As SEC chairs go, Mary Jo has been one of the very best,” said Harvey Pitt, who was SEC chairman under President George W. Bush. “No one in that position will go uncriticized. But, in my view, the criticism has been completely unwarranted.” White plans to formally depart when Obama leaves office.   business business true Please provide a valid email address.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News World's Largest Student Cyber Security Contest Names Winners BROOKLYN, N.Y., Nov. 14, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ — Students from high schools through doctoral programs throughout North America, the Middle East, North Africa, and India competed in the final rounds of the world’s largest student-run security games, the 13th annual New York University Cyber Security Awareness Week (NYU CSAW), held November 12-14, 2016. For the first time in the history of NYU CSAW, the final round of contests expanded beyond NYU Tandon School of Engineering in Downtown Brooklyn to regional hubs at NYU Abu Dhabi – for finalists from North Africa and the Middle East – and the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur (IIT Kanpur). Continue Reading To solve the fictional murder mystery posed in the 2016 NYU CSAW High School Forensics Contest, students had to examine evidence in an LG smart watch donated by Google. Cyber Security Awareness Week, the world’s largest student-run cybersecurity contests, was held Nov. 10-12 at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, NYU Abu Dhabi, and the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. Finalists bested more than 10,000 students from more than 100 countries who competed remotely in preliminary rounds of six separate competitions. The best high school cyber sleuths tangled in the final rounds for over $1 million in scholarships.  Additionally, the NYU Center for Cyber Security will offer doctoral scholarships and fellowships to the NYU Tandon School of Engineering to college-level finalists who prevailed against student hackers and researchers at NYU CSAW’s three hubs. Capture the Flag For the signature event of NYU CSAW, Capture the Flag (CTF), 34 teams from a preliminary field of more than 2,500 teams earned finalist slots in Brooklyn, Abu Dhabi, and Kanpur. Fifteen undergraduate teams in the United States, eight in the United Arab Emirates, and 11 in India competed in notoriously difficult final-round hacking challenges that lasted 36 consecutive hours. In Brooklyn, a CTF challenge created by tech firm Vector 35 required contestants to reverse engineer a derivation of the popular Pokémon Go game. Players had to hack the game so that they could amass in hours a score that would normally take weeks or even months to achieve. “To do that requires real-world network analysis and program reverse-engineering skills,” said Jordan Wiens, CTF judge and co-founder of Vector 35. “These are the same kinds of tools the data security world has a dramatic need for right now.” Unemployment in cybersecurity hovers near zero, and according to estimates by Cisco, there are one million cybersecurity job vacancies this year alone, including more than 200,000 in the United States. Frost & Sullivan, in an often-cited report, predicts 1.5 million unfilled security positions worldwide by 2020. The team 1064 Shellphish from the University of California (Santa Barbara) featured brothers Brandon and Andrew Dutcher. Andrew had competed in the CTF team 1064CBread, which won second place in 2015, when all members were graduates or students of Dos Pueblos High School in Goleta, California. John Grosen, who was also on that original 1064CBread team, is now a freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and competed with MIT’s CTF team Don’t Hack Alone. His brother Paul, who competed last year as a freshman on Dos Pueblos High School’s High School Forensics (HSF) team 1064CBread, returned this year as well. The team became the first HSF competitor to place in NYU CSAW’s rigorous Department of Homeland Security Quiz. For the eighth consecutive year in Brooklyn, a team from Carnegie Mellon took top honors in the CSAW CTF.

The challenge was designed by a team of top NYU security faculty and students mentored by NYU Assistant Professor Michail Maniatakos and Nektarios Tsoutsos, a computer science doctoral candidate studying under Maniatakos at NYU Abu Dhabi. Using special chipsets supplied by CSAW sponsor Intel, teams were tasked with modifying a configurable microchip to make it immune to memory corruption, a common attack used by hackers. To qualify for the final round, teams submitted papers describing the techniques they would use to enhance a basic chip design so that memory corruption could not harm the system. In Brooklyn, first place went to a team from the University of Central Florida (UCF), which has produced podium winners for the past five years. UCF fielded teams that won first place in 2014 and 2012, and second place last year and in 2013.

The finalists competing on site at NYU Tandon and NYU Abu Dhabi faced a daunting challenge: solve a fictitious murder in part by obtaining the victim’s biometric data from real LG smart watches supplied to the teams by CSAW sponsor Google. In the United States, top-performing teams from the Midwest, West, South, and Northeast earned prizes to travel to NYU Tandon in Brooklyn to compete in the finals. Additionally, seven wildcard teams were invited based on their outstanding scores. For the third year running, a team from Poolesville (Maryland) High School captured the top HSF honors. Poolesville, which had both a regional winner and a wildcard team in the finals this year, has fielded finalist teams in every HSF since that contest’s inauguration in 2009.

Cabrera, chief cybersecurity officer of Trend Micro. Lucie Hayward, managing consultant at Kroll, led “Women in Cybersecurity: Decrypt your Future,” a workshop for students and professionals. For the first time CSAW included a one-day workshop on open source security software, “Security: Open Source.” Organized by Brendan Dolan-Gavitt, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at NYU Tandon, the workshop featured developers discussing their software and how it has been used to solve real-world security problems. The yearly career fair featured 20 prominent institutions that came to entice the talented students competing in CSAW and other cybersecurity students in the greater New York area for internships and full-time positions. Closing NYU CSAW was Neil Hershfield, deputy section manager of Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, who spoke about the threat posed by control system malware and the dearth of analysts with control systems expertise. NYU students and volunteer judges spend months preparing challenges and organizing NYU CSAW, which has grown from an internal event at the school to one of the best known competitions for students. This year it was supported by 26 sponsors. For more information on CSAW, visit csaw.engineering.nyu.edu. Follow @CSAW_NYUTandon.

Posted 15 Nov 2016 05:29 Updated 15 Nov 2016 05:47 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) Enlarge Caption  Email More A A NEW YORK: The Dow finished in positive territory on Monday (Nov 14) for a sixth straight day but other indices closed lower as a decline in the technology sector offset a steep rise in financial stocks. The blue chip benchmark hit an all-time high shortly after 1500 GMT at 18,934.05, as investors favoured healthcare and financial stocks. But major tech companies, which may not benefit from policies under the coming Donald Trump administration, saw their share prices fall. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished up 21.03 points (0.11 per cent) at 18,868.69. But the broader S&P 500 slipped 0.25 points (0.01 per cent) at 2,164.20 and the Nasdaq fell 18.72 points (0.36 per cent) to 5,218.40. Large players in the healthcare industry posted strong gains, with UnitedHealth Group rising four per cent, Anthem Inc moving up 3.6 per cent and Cigna Corporation adding 1.4 per cent. Financial stocks were also buoyed higher: JP Morgan Chase gained 3.7 per cent, Goldman Sachs rose 2.6 per cent and Morgan Stanley finished up 2.2 per cent. Michael James of Wedbush Securities said investors were favouring industries that the administration of President-elect Donald Trump may benefit and rotating out of those it may not. "The biggest tech stocks continue to be the worst performers," said James, identifying financial services, healthcare and infrastructure as "those three groups that people are expecting to be the main beneficiaries of a Trump presidency." US drug manufacturers saw share prices drop: Johnson & Johnson fell 1.6 per cent, Eli Lilly and Co lost 0.8 per cent and Pfizer finished 0.6 per cent lower. While campaigning, Trump vowed to allow access to imported pharmaceutical products in a bid to reduce prescription drug prices. Samsung's announcement on Monday that it would purchase the automotive electronics company Harman International saw Harman's share price finish up more than 25 per cent at US$109.72 but that was shy of Samsung's per-share offer of US$112. - AFP/de Email More YOU MAY ALSO LIKE From Our Website From the Web Happening Now new window view more My Facebook Friends Back To Top JUMP TO Select Section Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Navigate to: News TV Watch Live GET OUR APPS iPhone/iPad Android Get Our News Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS News Asia Pacific World Sport Technology Lifestyle Photos Archives Singapore Business Entertainment Health Videos Special Reports TV Live News Schedule Shows Services Weather ADVERTISE WITH US Online Mobile TV Contact Sales Channel NewsAsia Channel News Asia About Us Coverage Hotel Partners Events & Seminars Presenters & Correspondents Contact Us Mediacorp Mediacorp News Group © 2016 About Mediacorp Pte Ltd Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Back To Top

Skip to content Military Technologies Military Press Releases World’s Largest Student Cyber Security Contest Names Winners Finalists bested more than 10,000 students from more than 100 countries who competed remotely in preliminary rounds of six separate competitions. The best high school cyber sleuths tangled in the final rounds for over $1 million in scholarships.  Additionally, the NYU Center for Cyber Security will offer doctoral scholarships and fellowships to the NYU Tandon School of Engineering to college-level finalists who prevailed against student hackers and researchers at NYU CSAW’s three hubs. Capture the Flag For the signature event of NYU CSAW, Capture the Flag (CTF), 34 teams from a preliminary field of more than 2,500 teams earned finalist slots in Brooklyn, Abu Dhabi, and Kanpur. Fifteen undergraduate teams in the United States, eight in the United Arab Emirates, and 11 in India competed in notoriously difficult final-round hacking challenges that lasted 36 consecutive hours. In Brooklyn, a CTF challenge created by tech firm Vector 35 required contestants to reverse engineer a derivation of the popular Pokémon Go game. Players had to hack the game so that they could amass in hours a score that would normally take weeks or even months to achieve. “To do that requires real-world network analysis and program reverse-engineering skills,” said Jordan Wiens, CTF judge and co-founder of Vector 35. “These are the same kinds of tools the data security world has a dramatic need for right now.” Unemployment in cybersecurity hovers near zero, and according to estimates by Cisco, there are one million cybersecurity job vacancies this year alone, including more than 200,000 in the United States. Frost & Sullivan, in an often-cited report, predicts 1.5 million unfilled security positions worldwide by 2020. The team 1064 Shellphish from the University of California (Santa Barbara) featured brothers Brandon and Andrew Dutcher. Andrew had competed in the CTF team 1064CBread, which won second place in 2015, when all members were graduates or students of Dos Pueblos High School in Goleta, California. John Grosen, who was also on that original 1064CBread team, is now a freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and competed with MIT’s CTF team Don’t Hack Alone. His brother Paul, who competed last year as a freshman on Dos Pueblos High School’s High School Forensics (HSF) team 1064CBread, returned this year as well. The team became the first HSF competitor to place in NYU CSAW’s rigorous Department of Homeland Security Quiz. For the eighth consecutive year in Brooklyn, a team from Carnegie Mellon took top honors in the CSAW CTF. NYU Tandon Winners: First place: PPP1, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh Team members: Tim Becker, Corwin de Boor, Samuel Kim, Matthew Savage Second place: RPISEC, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York Team members: Nick Burnett, Joshua Ferrell, Kareem El-Faramawi, Branden Clark Third place: Batman’s Kitchen, University of Washington, Seattle       Team members: Dan Arens, Stanley Hsieh, Alex Kirchhoff, Bo Wang NYU Abu Dhabi Winners: First place: dcua2, Mundiapolis University, Morocco Team members: Amine Cherrai, Bilal Kardadou, Ilyas Rahmani, Mohammed Belcaid Second place: MrAdmin, ENSIAS, Morocco  Team members: Anass Bouchnafa, Azzeddine Djekmani, Oualid Zaazaa, Yaakoub Najih Third place: DC21321, Bordj Bou Arreridj University, Algeria          Team members: Adel Merabet, Mohamed Zehraoui, Ramzi Bourahli IIT Kanpur Winners: First place: InfoSecIITR, Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee Second place: Bi0s, Amrita University Third Place: d4rkc0de, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi Embedded Security Challenge This year’s hardware security competition — the most difficult hacking event at NYU CSAW — brought five finalists to Brooklyn, seven to NYU Abu Dhabi and two to IIT Kanpur. The challenge was designed by a team of top NYU security faculty and students mentored by NYU Assistant Professor Michail Maniatakos and Nektarios Tsoutsos, a computer science doctoral candidate studying under Maniatakos at NYU Abu Dhabi. Using special chipsets supplied by CSAW sponsor Intel, teams were tasked with modifying a configurable microchip to make it immune to memory corruption, a common attack used by hackers. To qualify for the final round, teams submitted papers describing the techniques they would use to enhance a basic chip design so that memory corruption could not harm the system. In Brooklyn, first place went to a team from the University of Central Florida (UCF), which has produced podium winners for the past five years. UCF fielded teams that won first place in 2014 and 2012, and second place last year and in 2013. NYU Tandon Winners: First place: KnightSec, The University of Central Florida, Orlando Team members: Orlando Arias, Dean Sullivan, Heather Lawrence, Kelvin Ly Mentor: Yier Jiin Second place: Esisar, Grenoble INP-ESISAR, France Team members: Cyril Bresch, Adrien Michelet-Gignoux, Thomas Meyer, Laurent Amato Mentor: David Hely Third place: Wildcats, University of New Hampshire, Durham Team members: Sean Kramer, Zhiming Zhang Mentor: Qiaoyan Yu NYU Abu Dhabi Winners: First place: Breakfast Club(), NYU Abu Dhabi, U.A.E.

The finalists competing on site at NYU Tandon and NYU Abu Dhabi faced a daunting challenge: solve a fictitious murder in part by obtaining the victim’s biometric data from real LG smart watches supplied to the teams by CSAW sponsor Google. In the United States, top-performing teams from the Midwest, West, South, and Northeast earned prizes to travel to NYU Tandon in Brooklyn to compete in the finals. Additionally, seven wildcard teams were invited based on their outstanding scores. For the third year running, a team from Poolesville (Maryland) High School captured the top HSF honors. Poolesville, which had both a regional winner and a wildcard team in the finals this year, has fielded finalist teams in every HSF since that contest’s inauguration in 2009.

Cabrera, chief cybersecurity officer of Trend Micro. Lucie Hayward, managing consultant at Kroll, led “Women in Cybersecurity: Decrypt your Future,” a workshop for students and professionals. For the first time CSAW included a one-day workshop on open source security software, “Security: Open Source.” Organized by Brendan Dolan-Gavitt, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering at NYU Tandon, the workshop featured developers discussing their software and how it has been used to solve real-world security problems. The yearly career fair featured 20 prominent institutions that came to entice the talented students competing in CSAW and other cybersecurity students in the greater New York area for internships and full-time positions. Closing NYU CSAW was Neil Hershfield, deputy section manager of Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, who spoke about the threat posed by control system malware and the dearth of analysts with control systems expertise. NYU students and volunteer judges spend months preparing challenges and organizing NYU CSAW, which has grown from an internal event at the school to one of the best known competitions for students. This year it was supported by 26 sponsors. For more information on CSAW, visit csaw.engineering.nyu.edu. Follow @CSAW_NYUTandon.

Home Markets World markets Wall Street falls as tech drags; investors eye US president-elect Donald Trump policies Wall Street falls as tech drags; investors eye US president-elect Donald Trump policies U.S. stocks were lower in early afternoon trading on Monday as tech stocks weighed and investors looked for more clarity on President-elect Donald Trump's policies. By: Reuters | Published: November 15, 2016 1:53 AM U.S. stocks were lower in early afternoon trading on Monday as tech stocks weighed and investors looked for more clarity on President-elect Donald Trump’s policies. (Reuters) U.S. stocks were lower in early afternoon trading on Monday as tech stocks weighed and investors looked for more clarity on President-elect Donald Trump’s policies. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has remained under pressure as investors pour more money in other sectors that are seen benefiting from Trump’s policies. The S&P technology index’s 2.08 percent fall led the decliners, with the index having lost more than 3 percent since the election last week. Apple was down 3.4 percent and weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, followed by Facebook and Microsoft. Visa’s 5.5 percent fall dragged the Dow. The Dow, which capped off its best week in five years on Friday, hit a another record-high just after the start of trading but soon lost those gains. Since Trump’s triumph last Tuesday, investors have been betting on his campaign promises to simplify regulation in the health and financial sectors and boost spending on infrastructure. However, analysts said investors want specific details regarding Trump’s policies and are also awaiting key appointments in his administration. “In any election cycle, many candidates make a lot of election promises and obviously they can’t deliver for a variety of reasons on all these promises,” said Mohannad Aama, managing director at Beam Capital Management in New York. “Right now during this transition period, there is a lot of pricing in the unknown.” The financial index rose 1.77 percent, with Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan providing the biggest boost. The index has risen over 8 percent in the last three sessions on hopes of deregulation and higher interest rates. The industrial index was also up 0.36 percent, buoyed by prospects for increased infrastructure outlays. At 12:40 p.m. ET (1740 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average was down 9.28 points, or 0.05 percent, at 18,838.38, the S&P 500 was down 5.51 points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,158.94 and the Nasdaq Composite index was down 35.30 points, or 0.67 percent, at 5,201.81. The risk of faster domestic inflation and wider budget deficits if Trump goes on a spending binge sent yields on U.S. Treasury and other benchmark global bonds higher. The dollar index surged to an 11-month high. Yields on the U.S. 10-year Treasury notes climbed to their highest since January on Monday at 2.30 percent, while 30-year paper shot above 3 percent. Rising inflation hurts bond prices because it makes their future interest payments worth less. A host of U.S. Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to make appearances on Monday, including Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker and San Francisco Fed President John Williams. The central bank is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting, with traders pricing in an 91 percent chance, according to CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Oil fell more than 2 percent to its lowest in three months, as the prospect of another year of oversupply and weak prices overshadowed chances OPEC will reach a deal to cut output. Harman International rose 25.1 percent to $109.66 after Samsung Electronics announced an $8 billion deal to buy the company. Mentor Graphics surged more than 19 percent to a record high of $36.55 after Siemens agreed to buy the company in a $4.5 billion deal. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,604 to 1,388. On the Nasdaq, 1,532 issues rose and 1,247 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 79 new 52-week highs and three new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 394 new highs and 24 new lows. Please Wait while comments are loading...

PHOTO: REUTERS Nov 14, 2016 5:50 AM STOCK-MARKET bulls applauded the election of Donald Trump, driving the Dow Jones Industrial Average to a new record high amid bets that Mr Trump's pro-business goals rather than the more sinister aspects of his campaign would come to define his administration. But Wall Street strategists warn that longer term, Mr Trump's trade and domestic policies may not be so stock market-friendly. In the weeks ahead, volatility looks set to continue. Shares of drug makers, biotech companies, energy companies, miners and banks all soared for a simple reason: President-elect Trump will almost certainly cut regulatory fetters and tax bills for all of these companies. Shares of Silicon Valley giants Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix, Google (or Alphabet, as it's now known) - the quartet known as FANG - declined, however. These companies had thrived in the 21st century economic order, where America is only one of many important markets. Mr Trump has promised his followers to turn back the economic clock to the 1950s when the US reigned in the global economy, even if that means sacrificing free trade for domestic prosperity. Investors are piling into shares of copper miners and construction-machinery builders in the belief that he can make the rust belt great again - at least for a couple of years. Investors are also betting that Mr Trump, who, among his many boasts, advertises himself as the ultimate negotiator, will compromise on his most extreme positions. "There are still lots of checks and balances in there that would hopefully negate a lot of the bombastic things he said," said Ryan Detrick, senior investment strategist at brokerage LPL Financial. Few educated people would debate the dangerous nature of Mr Trump's promises or the danger they pose to the US economy - not to mention the society itself. The idea that optimists are harbouring, however, is that Mr Trump, the president, will be completely different from Mr Trump, the candidate. The fact that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote could inspire some humility in Mr Trump, some of these optimists say. "Most of Trump's more troubling policies (on immigration, protectionism) are likely to be toned down, and some of his policies can be seen as positive for equities (more fiscal spending and a cut in the corporate tax rate)," said analysts at brokerage Credit Suisse. Certainly, Mr Trump's acceptance speech sounded like it came from a different person than the bilious demagogue heard on the campaign trail. In victory, Mr Trump focused on his pledges to build roads, bridges and other infrastructure. Market strategists, such as Mr Detrick, predict this will be the first order of business for a Trump administration. That's one of the reasons copper prices and shares of heavy industry companies soared. Companies throughout the US could also benefit from a cut in the corporate tax rate, which will bring the nation from among the highest tax domiciles in the world to among the lowest, according to analysts at brokerage Goldman Sachs. The other reason for the rally was what Tom Elliott, international investment strategist at deVere Group, called "lightening the load of regulations on certain sectors". Regulation-trimming is very popular with Republicans and independents, and is set to be near the top of Mr Trump's agenda, too. A rally in financial stocks took banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America to levels not seen since the financial crisis. Already, on the website set up by Mr Trump's transition team, greatagain.gov, the president-elect has promised to "dismantle" Dodd-Frank, the 2010 regulations designed to rein in Wall Street and prevent the kind of financial-system failures that brought on the Great Recession. Mr Trump's transition team later walked the pledge back, telling The Wall Street Journal only certain provisions of the law would be amended. What's clear, however, is that Mr Trump wants a Wall Street- friendly Treasury secretary. Any lightening of bank regulation could pay massive dividends (literally) for investors - and the employees on banks' trading desks - in the short term, but could very well sow the seeds for the next financial crisis. After all, it was the repeal of Glass-Steagall Act - the 1930s predecessor to Dodd-Frank, itself less than a decade old - that some people cite for the 2008 financial crisis. Healthcare stocks surged last week as traders expressed relief that Mrs Clinton won't get a chance to impose controls on the price hikes that she railed against on the campaign trail. Profits and share prices of biotech companies had risen steadily alongside prices of their products for a decade until Mrs Clinton and others drew attention to the subject. Now, brokerages such as Morgan Stanley say investors will pay premiums for promising biotech companies - and make healthcare rally again. It's Mr Trump's more controversial policies that could trip up the stock market eventually. "The economic impact of the election depends on whether Congress or the President dictates policy," said analysts at brokerage Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in a research note. "The most bullish growth scenario combines a Trump policy (fiscal expansion) with a House Republican policy (free trade)." There are some signs that Mr Trump will govern in a more even-handed style than his bellicose campaign mode. So far, there is scant evidence that Mr Trump will "tone down" his approach to trade and immigration, however. Can Mr Trump revive Dwight Eisenhower or Ronald Reagan's America, like dusting off an old reality-show concept? Maybe he can - for a year or two - but neither the US economy nor the stock market can grow for long without population growth or expansion of trade.

Bond yields climbed to their highest levels this year, which pointed to higher interest rates and bigger profits for banks from lending money. Investors have been selling bonds, pushing yields higher, as they expect the spending plans of President-elect Donald J. Trump to lead to higher inflation. KEEPING SCORE The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up 0.1 percent, and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was unchanged. The Nasdaq composite index lost 0.4 percent. TECH TROUBLES Shares of technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple stock gave up 2.5 percent while Facebook stock declined 3.3 percent and shares of Microsoft slid 1.5 percent. Shares of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped 2.4 percent. Tech stocks have struggled over the last few days as investors wondered if Mr. Trump’s policies as president would hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. BANK BONANZA Bank stocks continued to surge, rising in part because of the big jump in bond yields since the election. Investors were also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. Mr. Trump’s election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Bank of America stock rose 5.6 percent and shares of JPMorgan Chase picked up 3.7 percent.

Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it was too low. Belden stock added 2.2 percent. BONDS AND CURRENCIES However, the view in bond markets was somewhat different, with investors fretting over the inflation outlook and the more lax spending environment. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds was up 0.09 percentage points Monday at 2.2 percent. The rise in bond yields has helped support the dollar as traders price in the prospect of bigger returns on their holdings. The euro was down 0.9 percent at $1.0753 while the dollar rose 1.3 percent to 108.06 yen. 3-Month Treasury Bills High rate at weekly auction. % 0.54 0.515% 0.48 0.42 0.36 0.30 0.24 Aug. Sept. Oct.

TRUMP FACTOR Stocks went into a long skid as the presidential campaign came to its conclusion, but in the last few days stocks have risen as investors hoped his presidency would mean cutbacks in regulations that affect energy and banks, among other businesses. The Dow has reached record highs, with the biggest recent gains going to the financial firms Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, the machinery maker Caterpillar and the drug company Merck. EUROPEAN MARKETS In Germany, the DAX rose 0.2 percent, and in France, the CAC 40 gained 0.4 percent. The FTSE 100 was up 0.3 percent in Britain.

A closer look reveals that things aren’t as bad as they might seem. While local-currency bonds suffered their biggest losses last week since 2008 following the Republican’s surprise victory, a gauge of volatility in developing-market currencies remained 16% below the levels seen in February. The cost to hedge against foreign-exchange losses is 38% cheaper than in August 2015 when China’s yuan devaluation rattled global investors. In a global bond sell-off fueled by expectations that Mr. Trump will increase government spending, emerging-market traders are by no means capitulating. While bracing for the risks of protectionist policies, they’re betting faster growth and narrowing current account deficits will help most developing countries weather the rout. The recent declines have “created a great buying opportunity,” said Koon Chow, a strategist at Union Bancaire Privee Ubp SA in London. “We could get to the stage where, in one or two weeks time, US Treasury yields stabilize and, if that happens, emerging markets will come back.” While it’s too early to call a bottom, Mr. Chow said domestic bonds in Brazil and Russia start to look attractive, together with the Colombian and Peruvian currencies. Asian exchange rates are likely to remain under pressure, he said. More than $1.2 trillion was wiped off the value of global bonds last week as Mr. Trump’s win bolstered the view that a government spending splurge may accelerate US growth and inflation. Emerging markets were among the hardest-hit as the real-estate mogul pledged on the campaign trail to pull America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, brand China a currency manipulator and build a wall along the border with Mexico. RESTRAINED SELLING Since the Nov. 8 election, developing-nation local-currency bonds have tumbled 7.3% through Nov. 11, the biggest three-day slump since October 2008. The decline cut the bonds’ return this year to 8.5%. Investors yanked a record $301 million from BlackRock Inc.’s $8.9 billion emerging-market fixed-income fund on Nov. 10. In the currency market, Mexico’s peso plunged 12% to a record low while the Brazilian real and South Africa’s rand have lost more than 6%. The selling extended to Asia on Monday. The Malaysian ringgit sank 0.9% to a nine-month low and South Korea’s won depreciated 0.5% to the weakest since June. The Indonesian rupiah extended declines after falling as much as 3% Friday, the most on an intraday basis since September 2013. Bank Indonesia said Friday it was in the market to stabilize the rupiah, adding that outflows were moderate and it expects the slide to be temporary. Bank Negara Malaysia said the monetary authority’s role is to continue managing “extreme volatilities in the ringgit, with no targeted level.” Indian state-run banks sold dollars on behalf of the Reserve Bank, according to two Mumbai-based traders, who asked not to be identified. Still, there are indications that the selloff may be limited. While hedging costs in the currency market increased to a five-month high of 4.3% on Nov. 10, they were lower than those of 6.9% in August 2015, according to data compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co. At 11.3%, JPMorgan’s gauge of currency volatility is below this year’s high of 13.4% set in February. STRONGER FUNDAMENTALS One reason is that emerging countries are on a stronger footing now compared with three years ago during the so-called taper tantrum when then Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s signal to reduce monetary stimulus sent a shock wave through global markets. Developing-nation local-currency bonds lost about 16% in less than four months. Economic growth is picking up this year for the first time since 2010 with Brazil and Russia digging themselves out of recessions, the International Monetary Fund estimates. The average shortfall of current accounts in South Africa, Brazil, Turkey, India and Indonesia, a group branded as the “fragile five” by Morgan Stanley in 2013, has shrunk to 2.4% of gross domestic product, from a record 5% in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Foreign reserves have increased in countries including Indonesia and India, providing them with ammunition to defend their currencies. “Fundamentals are much stronger than going into the taper tantrum,” said Paul McNamara, a money manager at GAM UK Ltd. The sell-off “just strikes me as a little bit extreme,” he said. Strategists at Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. warn that the rout is likely to deepen. Trump’s protectionist overtures, if acted upon, would slow exports from and reduce investments to developing markets, they say. In addition, central banks in the US, Europe and Japan are either ready to raise borrowing costs or stop easing further, dragging Treasuries yields up and putting pressure on emerging markets, Citigroup’s analyst Dirk Willer wrote in a note Friday. Local debt in Mexico, Poland and Hungary are most vulnerable to rising US yields, he said. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that investors are overweighting domestic bonds and have hedged between about 10% and 30% of their currency exposure in Brazil, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa. If the sell-off extends, investors may have to cut their holdings and increase their purchases of insurance, exacerbating the decline. For now, Mr. McNamara said he’s willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt. He’s looking to buy the South African rand once there’s some clarity about the direction of the new US government. “We just sit tight at the moment,” said McNamara, whose Julius Baer Local Emerging Bond Fund returned 13% this year. “All the negative is based on various assumptions. We’ve got very little hard evidence in terms of what the new administration is going to mean for emerging markets.” -- Bloomberg E-mail | Print |     From / email :     To :     E-mail (required) :     Message :     Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.    MORE STORIES Surprise farm growth boosts GDP hopes Nayong Pilipino, rail PPP lead approved projects September cash remittances highest for the year, so far; but growth slows Moody’s flags added credit risk SEC issues listing, trading rules for dollar-priced securities Government readies wider environmental audit Many emerging markets may be down but not yet out amid Trump tantrum Economists see robust Q3 growth Philippines among economies highly exposed’ to Trump policies Japan credit rater keeps PHL’s investment grade    MOST READ    MOST E-MAILED 1.

 Stock markets are predicting disaster in London property prices post-Brexit Oscar Williams-Grut Nov. 11, 2016, 3:53 AM 1,321 facebook linkedin twitter email print Lightning strikes near a church in south London. Lewis Whyld PA Archive/PA Images An Irish property tycoon says London's property market is "tanking by the day" in the wake of Brexit, with financial markets forecasting the second biggest ever collapse in the value of office and retail space in the capital. Scott Crowe, Chief Investment Strategist at CenterSquare, told Business Insider that financial markets are pricing in a 15% collapse in the value of commercial real estate in London as a result of the Brexit vote. Bloomberg reports on Friday that Stephen Vernon, chairman of Green Property, said at a conference that London property values are collapsing, creating a potentially "fantastic" buying opportunity. Green Property, which made a fortune selling Irish property before the bubble collapsed in 2008, has closed its London office for now and is waiting for prices to go lower before re-entering the market. Crowe told Business Insider: "We've gone back and we've looked at every single real estate correction in the last three decades in the UK. What the market is pricing in now is the second worst correction in commercial real estate prices after the great financial crisis. It's on par with the commerical real estate downturn that we actually saw in the early 1990s." CenterSquare is the real asset arm of US bank BNYMellon, with approximately $10 billion (£7.9 billion) in assets under management. Crowe says his view is stock markets are "over discounting" the fall in London office and shop space value. He says: "What we're seeing right now is the market is forecasting a 15% plus decline in real estate values, which we think is unrealistic. "We think rent is probably going to fall 5-10%, but mitigating that is two things. The first is the fact gilts have come in since Brexit making real estate debt costs cheaper. Certainly, capital availability from the banks for commercial real estate hasn't changed, so that's supportive of valuations. And secondly, the pound has also corrected by 15%. The pound and gilts are really going to be the shock absorbers for the market, even though office rents, particularly City office rents, are likely to correct. "So what we expect is a single digit decline, something like 5%, in commercial real estate values. That all sets up to make the UK REIT market relatively cheap, particularly on a global basis." CenterSquare has $1.5 billion (£1.1 billion) invested in European Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), with about half of that in the UK. Stock markets hate uncertainty and they always over discount it. That's where you have an opportunity as an active manager. London-focused REIT Great Portland Estates is down over 18% since the June 23 referendum on Britain's membership of the European Union, while Derwent London is down over 27%. Crowe says: "If you look at the evidence to date, it certainly supports our point of view. We had about two weeks of stress — some of the open-ended property funds had to put gates up, close the fund, and sell some assets. Those assets came on the market at a maximum of about 10% discount to prior valuation. They were scooped up very, very quickly by large institutional buyers. We really haven't seen any more selling since that two weeks of distress." At least nine UK-focused investment firms suspended trading in their property funds or market down prices in July, freezing £15 billion ($19.4 billion) of assets. It came after panicked investors rushed to withdraw money in the wake of the Brexit vote. Funds were forced to hold a fire sale to raise funds to pay back investors. But Crowe points out that inflows recently turned positive for the first time since the vote, meaning investors are note putting more money into UK property than they are withdrawing. Much of the decline in London-focused property stocks and funds has been driven by a fear that the capital is about to lose its status as the financial capital of Europe. EU officials have repeatedly signalled that Britain can't keep financial passporting rights unless it accepts Freedom of Movement, something that is seen as highly unlikely. 5,500 British firms with a combined turnover £9 billion ($11.3 billion) rely on passporting to sell services and products to Europe, according to the FCA. The loss of passporting rights would therefore likely lead to the loss or relocation of thousands of jobs out of the UK. JPMorgan, UBS, and the head of the British Bankers Association (BBA) have all publically warned this is the case and Goldman Sachs is said to be considering relocating as many as 2,000 jobs. France and Germany have also been publicly wooing finance firms to get them to relocate. Crowe is sceptical. He says: "If they took 10% of the financial industry in London and put it in Frankfurt, they'd almost double the size of the industry there. There's almost no other city in Europe that has the scale. Paris is not going to be the next financial capital of Europe. The labour laws in Europe are a barrier for people setting up headquarters of investment banks in these countries. "London's not going to go away but it is going to be diminished slightly. Some of these jobs are going to move to Europe." He says that investors seem to have "thrown out with the bathwater" when it comes to property prices in London's West End, saying: "I think the West End is going to be much more resilient than the City." Shaftesbury, which owns 14 acres of the West End, fell 13% the day after the Brexit vote but has since rallied. Is it still around 3% lower than its pre-vote peak, however. Crowe says: "Stock markets hate uncertainty and they always over discount it. That's where you have an opportunity as an active manager. I don't know when the stock prices revert to their underlying fair value but I know they will. It's a question of when not if."

Home Latest Popular Pakistan Today's Paper Opinion World Sport Business Magazine Culture Blogs Tech Multimedia Archive In Depth SEARCH Fed faces overhaul under new leader Jeanna Smialek | Christopher Condon — Updated Nov 14, 2016 10:05am WHATSAPP   1 Comment  Email Email Your Name: Recipient Email:  Print The leadership, powers and policies of the Federal Reserve may look very different in 18 months. Donald Trump can’t remove Fed Chair Janet Yellen from office before her four-year term expires. By mid-2018, however, Trump can replace the Fed’s top personnel and potentially alter monetary and regulatory policies. Some members of the Republican-controlled Congress may also take aim at the Fed’s independence from political influence. “Trump will have the ability to substantially reshape the nation’s central bank,” said Aaron Klein, a research fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Still, discussions of potential remakes come with one massive caveat. No Fed watchers seemed confident in predicting even what kind of nominees Trump is likely to put up for the Fed, nor what kind of regulatory approach he is likely to favour. During his campaign, Trump railed against the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which greatly increased restrictions on banks operating in the US, but also said he would reinstate a separation between bank lending and securities underwriting. As Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University puts it: “In every conversation I have about a President Trump, there is an asterisk of unpredictability.” Changes at the Fed can start with two vacancies on the Board of Governors in Washington, whose seven seats — when all filled — form a majority and centre of influence on the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee. Trump is likely to name one of his new picks to the also-vacant post of vice chair for supervision, a job created by Dodd-Frank. Mark Calabria, director of Financial Regulation Studies at the Cato Institute in Washington, called that job the Republican Party’s ‘best lever to shape the Fed in the near term.’ Filling that role may also create another opening on the Board. Governor Daniel Tarullo has led the Fed’s efforts on bank supervision and regulation for years, but never took on the formal title of vice chair for supervision, which requires Senate confirmation and annual testimony at public hearings on Capitol Hill. Several people interviewed said that they’d expect Tarullo to step down if his biggest job at the Fed were handed over to an incoming governor. A Fed spokesman didn’t respond to requests for comment. Trump will also get to name the central bank’s two most powerful officials when Yellen’s four-year term runs out in February 2018 and Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer’s expires in June of that year. Trump accused Yellen during the campaign of holding interest rates low to boost the economy until President Barack Obama left office. While many economists dismiss the notion that Yellen may resign under a Trump presidency, few expect him to reappoint either Yellen or Fischer, leading to a wide variety of opinions over the type of replacements he might favour. Fed leadership roles “could be filled with individuals less prone to follow the gradualist course laid out in recent” Fed policy statements, according to Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in New York. Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies LLC in New York, was more dubious. “Probably Trump was very critical of Janet Yellen when he thought she was helping Hillary Clinton,” McCarthy said. “A President Trump is going to be a lot more sympathetic to an accommodative Fed because he wants the economy to do well.” Other big changes could come through Congress, where Republicans have already crafted a number of bills the Fed views as hostile. One would force the Fed to set interest rates according to a formula — along the lines of the so-called Taylor Rule created by Stanford University Professor John Taylor — or to otherwise explain to lawmakers why they strayed from the formula. Trump economic adviser Stephen Moore said as recently as last month he favours the idea. Another proposal, backed by Kentucky Senator Rand Paul, would subject the Fed’s monetary policy making to regular ‘audits,’ or reviews. Yet another bill, backed by Alabama Republican Senator Richard Shelby, proposed creating a commission to review the structure of the central bank. The Fed has said the proposed changes weren’t necessary and largely represented attempts to influence monetary policy. None of the proposals passed Congress, and faced a likely veto from Obama if they had. While it isn’t clear that Republican leadership would back any of those measures next year, protection from the White House might now disappear. “Legislation to change the mandate, mission and independence of the Federal Reserve is very much on the table for this next Congress,” Brookings’ Klein said. “The Fed can no longer count on a veto from the president to save its independence.” McCarthy, from Jefferies, agreed: “The Fed has never had fewer friends in Washington than it has right now.” —With assistance from Craig Torres —Bloomberg/The Washington Post Service Published in Dawn, Business & Finance weekly, November 13th, 2016 DAWN_VIDEO - /1029551/DAWN-RM-1x1 WHATSAPP   1 Comment  Email  Print Newspaper Govt not withdrawing Rs5,000 banknote: Dar Interbank, open market gap widens to Rs2 per $ Most Popular 24 Hours 3 Days Commented Seven Pakistan Army soldiers killed in 'unprovoked' Indian firing across LoC: ISPR 'Today marks dawn of new era': CPEC dreams come true as Gwadar port goes operational Famed 'Afghan Girl' Sharbat Gula to travel to India Trump vows to immediately deport up to three million undocumented immigrants In the line of fire: Who were the soldiers who died last night?

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ By Ye Xie The selloff in emerging markets after Donald Trump’s US presidential election was intense. A closer look reveals that things aren’t as bad as they might seem. While local-currency bonds suffered their biggest losses last week since 2008 following the Republican’s surprise victory, a gauge of volatility in developing-market currencies remained 16 per cent below the levels seen in February. The cost to hedge against foreign-exchange losses is 38 per cent cheaper than it was in August 2015 when China’s yuan devaluation rattled global investors. In a global bond selloff fueled by expectations that Trump will increase government spending, emerging-market traders are by no means capitulating. While bracing for the risks of protectionist policies, they’re betting faster growth and narrowing current account deficits will help most developing countries weather the rout. The recent declines have “created a great buying opportunity,” said Koon Chow, a strategist at Union Bancaire Privee Ubp SA in London. “We could get to the stage where, in one or two weeks time, US Treasury yields stabilize, and if that happens, emerging markets will come back.” While it’s too early to call a bottom, Chow said domestic bonds in Brazil and Russia start to look attractive, together with the Colombian and Peruvian currencies. Asian exchange rates are likely to remain under pressure, he said. More than $1.2 trillion was wiped off the value of global bonds last week as Trump’s win bolstered the view that a government spending splurge may accelerate US growth and inflation. Emerging markets were among the hardest-hit as the real-estate mogul pledged on the campaign trail to pull America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, brand China a currency manipulator and build a wall along the border with Mexico. Restrained Selling Since the Nov. 8 election, developing-nation local-currency bonds have tumbled 7.3 per cent through Nov. 11, the biggest three-day slump since October 2008. The decline cut the bonds’ return this year to 8.5 per cent. Investors yanked a record $301 million from BlackRock Inc.’s $8.9 billion emerging-market fixed-income fund on Nov. 10. In the currency market, Mexico’s peso plunged 12 per cent to a record low while the Brazilian real and South Africa’s rand have lost more than 6 per cent. The selling extended to Asia on Monday. The Malaysian ringgit sank 0.9 per cent to a nine-month low and South Korea’s won depreciated 0.5 per cent to the weakest since June. The Indonesian rupiah extended declines after falling as much as 3 per cent Friday, the most on an intraday basis since September 2013. Bank Indonesia said Friday it was in the market to stabilize the rupiah, adding that outflows were moderate and it expects the slide to be temporary. Bank Negara Malaysia said the monetary authority’s role is to continue managing “extreme volatilities in the ringgit, with no targeted level.” Indian state-run banks sold dollars on behalf of the Reserve Bank, according to two Mumbai-based traders, who asked not to be identified. Still, there are indications that the selloff may be limited. While hedging costs in the currency market increased to a five-month high of 4.3 per cent on Nov. 10, they were lower than those of 6.9 per cent in August 2015, according to data compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co. At 11.3 per cent, JPMorgan’s gauge of currency volatility is below this year’s high of 13.4 per cent set in February. Stronger Fundamentals One reason is that emerging countries are on a stronger footing now compared with three years ago during the so-called taper tantrum when then Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s signal to reduce monetary stimulus sent a shock wave through global markets. Developing-nation local-currency bonds lost about 16 per cent in less than four months. Economic growth is picking up this year for the first time since 2010 with Brazil and Russia digging themselves out of recessions, the International Monetary Fund estimates. The average shortfall of current accounts in South Africa, Brazil, Turkey, India and Indonesia, a group branded as the “fragile five” by Morgan Stanley in 2013, has shrunk to 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product, from a record 5 per cent in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Foreign reserves have increased in countries including Indonesia and India, providing them with ammunition to defend their currencies. “Fundamentals are much stronger than going into the taper tantrum.” said Paul McNamara, a money manager at GAM UK Ltd. The selloff “just strikes me as a little bit extreme,” he said. Strategists at Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. warn that the rout is likely to deepen. Trump’s protectionist overtures, if acted upon, would slow exports from and reduce investments to developing markets, they say. In addition, central banks in the US, Europe and Japan are either ready to raise borrowing costs or stop easing further, dragging Treasuries yields up and putting pressure on emerging markets, Citigroup’s analyst Dirk Willer wrote in a note Friday. Local debt in Mexico, Poland and Hungary are most vulnerable to rising US yields, he said. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that investors are overweighting domestic bonds and have hedged between about 10 per cent and 30 per cent of their currency exposure in Brazil, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa. If the selloff extends, investors may have to cut their holdings and increase their purchases of insurance, exacerbating the decline. For now, McNamara said he’s willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt.

A closer look reveals that things aren’t as bad as they might seem. While local-currency bonds suffered their biggest losses last week since 2008 following the Republican’s surprise victory, a gauge of volatility in developing-market currencies remained 16 per cent below the levels seen in February. The cost to hedge against foreign-exchange losses is 38 per cent cheaper than it was in August 2015 when China’s yuan devaluation rattled global investors. In a global bond selloff fuelled by expectations that Trump will increase government spending, emerging-market traders are by no means capitulating. While bracing for the risks of protectionist policies, they’re betting faster growth and narrowing current account deficits will help most developing countries weather the rout. The recent declines have “created a great buying opportunity,” said Koon Chow, a strategist at Union Bancaire Privee Ubp SA in London. “We could get to the stage where, in one or two weeks time, US Treasury yields stabilise, and if that happens, emerging markets will come back.” While it’s too early to call a bottom, Chow said domestic bonds in Brazil and Russia start to look attractive, together with the Colombian and Peruvian currencies. Asian exchange rates are likely to remain under pressure, he said. More than US$1.2 trillion (RM5.1 trillion) was wiped off the value of global bonds last week as Trump’s win bolstered the view that a government spending splurge may accelerate US growth and inflation.  Emerging markets were among the hardest-hit as the real-estate mogul pledged on the campaign trail to pull America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, brand China a currency manipulator and build a wall along the border with Mexico. Restrained selling Since the November 8 election, developing-nation local-currency bonds have tumbled 7.3 per cent through November 11, the biggest three-day slump since October 2008. The decline cut the bonds’ return this year to 8.5 per cent. Investors yanked a record US$301 million from BlackRock Inc’s US$8.9 billion emerging-market fixed-income fund on November 10. In the currency market, Mexico’s peso plunged 12 per cent to a record low while the Brazilian real and South Africa’s rand have lost more than 6 per cent. The selling extended to Asia on Monday. The Malaysian ringgit sank 0.9 per cent to a nine-month low and South Korea’s won depreciated 0.5 per cent to the weakest since June. The Indonesian rupiah extended declines after falling as much as 3 per cent Friday, the most on an intraday basis since September 2013. Bank Indonesia said Friday it was in the market to stabilise the rupiah, adding that outflows were moderate and it expects the slide to be temporary. Bank Negara Malaysia said the monetary authority’s role is to continue managing “extreme volatilities in the ringgit, with no targeted level.” Indian state-run banks sold dollars on behalf of the Reserve Bank, according to two Mumbai-based traders, who asked not to be identified. Still, there are indications that the selloff may be limited. While hedging costs in the currency market increased to a five-month high of 4.3 per cent on November 10, they were lower than those of 6.9 per cent in August 2015, according to data compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co At 11.3 per cent, JPMorgan’s gauge of currency volatility is below this year’s high of 13.4 per cent set in February. Stronger fundamentals One reason is that emerging countries are on a stronger footing now compared with three years ago during the so-called taper tantrum when then Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s signal to reduce monetary stimulus sent a shock wave through global markets. Developing-nation local-currency bonds lost about 16 per cent in less than four months. Economic growth is picking up this year for the first time since 2010 with Brazil and Russia digging themselves out of recessions, the International Monetary Fund estimates. The average shortfall of current accounts in South Africa, Brazil, Turkey, India and Indonesia, a group branded as the “fragile five” by Morgan Stanley in 2013, has shrunk to 2.4 per cent of gross domestic product, from a record 5 per cent in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Foreign reserves have increased in countries including Indonesia and India, providing them with ammunition to defend their currencies. “Fundamentals are much stronger than going into the taper tantrum.” said  Paul McNamara, a money manager at GAM UK Ltd The selloff “just strikes me as a little bit extreme,” he said. Strategists at Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc warn that the rout is likely to deepen. Trump’s protectionist overtures, if acted upon, would slow exports from and reduce investments to developing markets, they say. In addition, central banks in the US, Europe and Japan are either ready to raise borrowing costs or stop easing further, dragging Treasuries yields up and putting pressure on emerging markets, Citigroup’s analyst Dirk Willer wrote in a note Friday. Local debt in Mexico, Poland and Hungary are most vulnerable to rising US yields, he said. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that investors are overweighting domestic bonds and have hedged between about 10 per cent and 30 per cent of their currency exposure in Brazil, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa. If the selloff extends, investors may have to cut their holdings and increase their purchases of insurance, exacerbating the decline. For now, McNamara said he’s willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt. He’s looking to buy the South African rand once there’s some clarity about the direction of the new US government. “We just sit tight at the moment,” said McNamara, whose Julius Baer Local Emerging Bond Fund returned 13 per cent this year. “All the negative is based on various assumptions. We’ve got very little hard evidence in terms of what the new administration is going to mean for emerging markets.” — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Nepal PM phones India’s Modi over rupee chaos Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites European equities drift higher United to delay taking Boeing jets in US$4.8b savings push Snapchat files for one of the biggest tech IPOs in years, sources say Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter Most Watched Now Week An in-depth look at Mazda’s SKYACTIV-G engine Reuters Video: Groin-flashing frog discovered in Australia Reuters Video: Supermoon dazzles in Havana Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Related Articles Ahead of Trump presidency, global investors sell bonds and grab stocks Dollar hits 11-month peak alongside US yields, bank stocks up Oil rebounds from three-month lows on renewed hopes for OPEC cut Wall Street ends flat as financials’ rise offsets tech drop Ringgit hit as higher US yields deepen Asia outflow worries Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Join the Conversation To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Store-brand credit card rates rising Patricia Sabatini, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 7:58 p.m. EST November 13, 2016 Among the stores with the highest rates were Big Lots at 29.99 percent, Zales at 29.24 percent and Staples at 28.24 percent (Photo: Dreamstime / TNS) The next time you step up to the register, beware the cashier promising freebies in exchange for signing up for a store credit card. Interest rates on cards issued by the nation’s largest retailers are averaging 23.24 percent, according to a new survey by comparison site Creditcards.com, based in Austin, Texas. It’s the highest rate since the website started tracking credit card rates in 2008 (when they averaged 18.28 percent). Overall, the average for all types of credit cards is 15.22 percent. “With their outrageously high (rates), most consumers would be wise to steer clear of these cards unless they’re 100 percent certain they can pay their balance off every single month,” said Matt Schulz, senior industry analyst at Creditcards.com. The survey reviewed 68 credit cards offered by 44 retailers. Nearly half of those store-branded cards carried an annual percentage rate of at least 25 percent. Among the stores with the highest rates were Big Lots at 29.99 percent, Zales at 29.24 percent and Staples at 28.24 percent. Those high rates look even worse considering that interest rates in general have been hovering at record lows since the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate to near zero at the end of 2008, where it remained until seeing a tiny quarter-point boost in December last year. The chief reason that retailer cards tend to charge higher rates than general-purpose cards is to compensate for the risk involved with extending instant approval at the register. The main lure among store cards is an immediate 10 percent or 15 percent discount at the check-out as a bonus for signing up. While the discount might pay off on a major purchase such as a refrigerator, most shoppers can get better rewards with a general purpose card, Schulz said. “Bonuses you get with a store card can’t compare … so you’re better off shopping around for another card,” he said. Sign-up bonuses have gotten sweeter in the last couple of years as card issuers compete for the best customers, he said. For example, the Chase Freedom Unlimited card offers a $150 cash back bonus for spending $500 in the first three months. “Percentage-wise, a store credit card can’t come close to matching that offer,” Schulz said. The Chase card also carries an introductory interest rate of 0 percent for the first 15 months, which rises to between 14.24 percent and 23.24 percent, depending on a customer’s creditworthiness. “It’s important that people don’t get pressured into making a bad choice” at the register, Schulz said. “If you are interested in an offer, take a brochure and read it at home. If you’re still interested, apply the next time you go to the store.” CONNECTTWEET 2 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2fplwxv TOP VIDEOS Pistons owner Tom Gores discusses possible move downtown 5:50 Tom Izzo on Dan Gilbert's $15 Million gift to MSU 2:14 ZF TRW automotive demonstrates self-driving technology 1:57 Building Mars spaceship parts in Metro Detroit 1:38 Tour the Detroit riverfront's industrial heart 2:27 Hamtramck’s Bon Bon Bon crafts artisan chocolates 3:55 Tomorrow's doctors have fun at the Little Medical School 0:39 New housing, retail development in New Center breaks ground 2:48 Henry Payne goes 0 to 60 in the Porsche Boxster-Cayman 2:01 Open Streets in Detroit 1:47

I learned the meditation technique taking over Wall Street and now I get why traders are willing to set aside 40 minutes a day Richard Feloni Nov. 13, 2016, 1:20 PM 130,690 facebook linkedin twitter email print That's me.Sarah Jacobs As I sat on a waiting room sofa in the David Lynch Foundation's office in September, it felt like a scene from one of Lynch's surrealist films. I was waiting for my first Transcendental Meditation lesson. My teacher Mario Orsatti, a man in his 60s with a penchant for big smiles and unwavering eye contact, took my offering of two apples, a kiwi, and purple irises I'd picked up at a bodega 20 minutes earlier as instructed, and ushered me into a plain, dark room. In front of an illustration of an Indian guru in an orange robe, sitting cross-legged with a golden aura, Mario handed me one of the irises and began solemnly reciting what I assumed to be a Sanskrit prayer. He proceeded to light candles and arrange the fruit and other items before him. Hedge fund billionaire Ray Dalio had helped popularize Transcendental Meditation (TM) on Wall Street when he proclaimed it "the single biggest influence in his life" a few years ago, but Dalio is widely known for his eccentricities. I wondered if other finance power players, like TM practitioners Third Point manager Dan Loeb and JPMorgan wealth management CEO Barry Sommers, were just following his lead. As for the celebrities who endorsed it — like Jerry Seinfeld, Martin Scorcese, Oprah Winfrey, and Dr. Oz — well, celebrities are often easy prey for this kind of stuff. I couldn't help but wonder: Was I being inducted into Wall Street's hot new cult? View As: One Page Slides The David Lynch Foundation's New York center is located on the 14th and 15th floors of a building in midtown, Manhattan. Sarah Jacobs Lynch, the acclaimed director ("Twin Peaks," "Mulholland Drive"), cofounded his foundation in 2005 with the intention of teaching TM for free to disadvantaged students, veterans with PTSD, and victims of domestic abuse. Bryan Bedder/Getty Images Through partnerships with middle and high schools in the US, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and shelters, the DLF has taught TM for free to 500,000 people. Sarah Jacobs Veterans can also take lessons at the DLF office, as one did during one of my trips. On my first visit, before my lessons began, I sat down with DLF teacher Mario Orsatti and DLF cofounder and executive director Bob Roth. Sarah Jacobs They're best friends of 40 years, and were fun to talk to — not at all the terrifying cult leaders I was afraid they might be. As they put it, TM is a simple but effective technique. The $960 fee offers lifetime access to all TM centers and teachers across the world, and it funds operations and the modest teacher salaries (roughly $40,000-$80,000) that allow them to teach people for free. If people seek out TM and cannot afford it, they can apply for scholarships. I returned for my introductory lesson two weeks later, on a pleasant fall Friday, late in the afternoon. Richard Feloni Roth and Orsatti offered me lessons with a fee waiver, as they had done with other journalists, so that I would have more context for my research.   I stopped off at the bodega down the street from the DLF office to buy some fruit and irises for the "traditional ceremony" I'd be participating in. I felt like I was about to step into one of Lynch's surrealist films. Orsatti had me take my shoes off and we walked into a darkened room. The materials for a puja ceremony to Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, the teacher to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of Transcendental Meditation.Ermindo Armino/AP He led me to a corner, where there was a small altar with an illustration of Brahmananda Saraswati, also know as Guru Dev ("divine teacher"). Guru Dev was the teacher of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of TM, and we were there to honor him before learning the technique. Orsatti handed me one of the irises and began solemnly reciting what I assumed to be a Sanskrit prayer. He proceeded to light candles and arrange the fruit and other items before him. I found it interesting, but I wouldn't figure out what was actually happening until weeks later. I was a little skeptical. My teacher Mario Orsatti doesn't look like a cult leader ...Sarah Jacobs But I didn't let myself off the hook! I allowed for the possibility that I was about to learn a valuable meditation technique ... even if it did seem a little cult-like. At the end of the ceremony, Orsatti turned to me and declared a meaningless "vibration word" that I recognized as my mantra, and I repeated it back to him. We sat down in sofas at either side of the room and began meditating. Mike Nudelman/Business Insider The technique itself is simple, consisting of sitting upright in a chair, closing your eyes for 20 minutes, and repeating a mantra — a meaningless "vibration word" provided by your teacher — in your head at no particular rhythm. It is recommended that one practice this twice daily, once in the morning and once in the evening. For most people, including myself, TM is easy to learn but takes a couple weeks to practice naturally. It's why your TM teacher checks in for a few followup lessons after the initial four-day introduction. My first meditation felt good. Sarah Jacobs This wasn't my first time meditating. Before this, I had spent eight months practicing mindfulness meditation (focusing on breathing and directing thoughts to certain images or ideas) for 10 minutes daily, through the app Headspace. It reminded me of my favorite aspects of meditations past, and I enjoyed the 20-minute duration, which was the longest I had ever meditated. The feeling of "transcendence" — which you get during especially good meditation sessions but not all — was familiar, and the feeling I had always gone for with other meditation techniques I had tried. As a side note: If you think meditating is like taking a nap from a seated position, you're doing it incorrectly. There is also years of peer-reviewed research that proves that the brain differentiates between sleep/dozing and meditation, and that meditation can quickly rid the body of stress-inducing hormones. I had three more days of training that week, to refine the technique. Headspace teacher Andy Puddicombe describes mindfulness using a highway metaphor.Headspace For example, I learned that if particularly stressful thoughts went through my head, it's helpful to stop repeating the mantra and let the thoughts float away before resuming it. There's a metaphor I learned from the creator of Headspace that applies to this type of meditation, as well. "Imagine yourself sitting by a busy highway," Headspace cofounder Andy Puddicombe says in one of his lessons. "Cars continue to pass by. You can choose to sit there and notice the cars without focusing on any of them, or you can follow a car down the road." It's the same with mindfulness meditation and TM. As you sit there with eyes closed, all kinds of thoughts may be flying through your mind. Instead of exerting energy to try to block them, which often backfires and makes the mind more cluttered, focus on breathing (mindfulness) or the mantra (TM), acknowledging that they exist without engaging them. I still had many questions about the organization behind TM. AP The best place to start finding answers was with the late Maharishi, the founder. In training classes, we were shown videos of the Maharishi (a title that means "seer"), a small man with long wispy hair, a scraggly beard, a high-pitched voice, and a penchant for giggling. As I learned more about him, my perception of him transformed from potential cult leader to one of several Indian philosophy teachers who introduced Westerners to their ancient traditions during an immigration wave in the early to mid-20th century. Born in India as Mahesh Prasad Varma in 1918, he renounced his name and familial ties in typical Hindu monk fashion after graduating from Allahabad University in 1942 with a physics degree and traveling to Jyotir Math in the Indian Himalayas to study under and serve Swami Brahmananda Saraswati, the man he reverentially called Guru Dev. Saraswati was the leader of the city's monastery, a lofty position within the religion. When the Maharishi began his global tour of spreading TM in 1958, he made it clear that although he and his guru were Hindu monks and TM was rooted in the ancient Vedic scriptures, his practice was not tied to the Hindu faith. One of the exceptions he made, however, was that TM teachers would perform a puja to Guru Dev in front of their students before an introductory lesson — that same ceremony with the fruit that made me uncomfortable on my first day. After learning more about the ritual itself and the Maharishi's intention to honor his teacher out of tradition, I was willing to accept this remnant of religion in a deliberately secularized practice. I discussed this with Orsatti at one of our follow-up meetings, and he told me that the Maharishi wanted to share this insight without restraining it to religion in any way. The highest aim of TM, then, is to make people more able to connect with others by having them be more in touch with themselves. In mid-October, after nearly 10 months of meditating, I went for my annual physical. One of the most significant studies that inspired doctors to begin taking TM seriously was one conducted by University of California, Irvine researchers in 1978. They compared stress hormone levels between subjects practicing TM for 20 minutes against a control group of people sitting with eyes closes for 20 minutes.University of California, Irvine via the David Lynch Foundation I told my doctor that I had been meditating for almost a year, first with mindfulness meditation, and then with TM. She said that there was a solid chance that it was a reason why my blood pressure was normal rather than moderately high for the first time in five years. She also told me she and other doctors she knows have recommended TM to patients due to the research out there from organizations like the American Heart Association and the University of California, Irvine. I was still left with a major question. A sadhu prays as he sits on the banks of Sangam, the confluence of the holy rivers Ganges, Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati, during the Maha Kumbh Mela on January 16, 2013 in Allahabad, IndiaDaniel Berehulak/Getty Images TM has spiritual roots but has also always been touted as a tool for healthy living. Were the two compatible, or was the TM organization being disingenuous? I discussed this dynamic with Suhag Shukla, executive director of the Hindu American Foundation, and while she has separate gripes about the general lack of understanding many Americans have of Hinduism's affect on popular culture, she said promoting meditation as part of a healthy lifestyle is actually authentic to its roots. You can understand the Vedas, she told me, as "scientific experiments of the mind," and so analyzing an ancient technique with the lens of modern science isn't a deceptive dilution. I've decided to continue practicing TM every day, for the recommended 20 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes at night. Sarah Jacobs I'm fully aware that I received $960 of training for free, and therefore I'm unable to comment on whether I can recommend someone pay that, or at least apply for a scholarship. For what it's worth, Bob Roth of the David Lynch Foundation told me he's been working to get TM lessons covered by insurance plans, given the accumulation of research in its favor, and he's hopeful it'll happen. As for me, I'm going to continue practicing TM twice a day. I use the app Meditation Timer, which I've set to chime after 20 minutes have passed, and again after the recommended two-minute "rest period" elapses. The extra two minutes help me ease back into a normal state, especially after a deep meditation. I'm a naturally anxious person, and meditating for the past year has improved my mood enough that my family and friends have told me they've noticed. Mindfulness meditation can do the trick, but I've decided to continue practicing TM due to its simplicity.

REUTERS/Tony Gentile/File photoMore MILAN (Reuters) - The board of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena will meet on Monday to set the terms for a bond-to-equity conversion that is part of the lender's capital boosting plans, a source familiar with the matter said on Sunday. Italy's third-biggest bank is planning to lay off a tenth of its staff, shut branches and sell assets to win investor backing for a 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) cash call, its third recapitalization in as many years. To help limit the size of the share sale it is studying a voluntary conversion of its subordinated debt. "The (conversion) operation will kick off after the shareholder meeting... and there will obviously be a premium offered to market price," the source said. The conversion plan will also include the Fresh hybrid instrument used to partly finance the costly acquisition of rival Antonveneta in 2007, the source said. Senior debt is not included in the plan.The bank - assisted by JP Morgan and Mediobanca - is due to hold an extraordinary shareholder meeting on Nov. 24 to approve the turnaround plan that also includes the sale of some 28 billion euros in bad loans at below book value. To underpin the cash call, management at the 544-year old lender has been on road shows to drum up support from potential anchor investors. Qatar's sovereign wealth fund has expressed a preliminary interest, sources said earlier this month. "Next week the road show will continue with a video call with U.S. and Asian investors," the source said. On Sunday, Il Sole 24 Ore said the bank was reaching out to Asian investors, especially Singapore wealth fund Temesek. According to the source, the board meeting on Monday will also take a decision on the sale of the lender's non-performing loans servicing platform known as Juliet.

(Photo Page) (image by leighblackall)   License   DMCA AS the election has drawn to a close, those on the left are in deep misery. We voted for Stein, or in some cases, chose not to vote (because not voting is the best way to rid elections of fraud.....or some argue) but we know that as proud as we are to have supported such an intelligent and honest person, that the media and public will hardly notice our votes. In 2012, I voted for Stein, who got her largest vote in my state Cali, but the next day, the media did not even report her vote totals. Our protest vote led to oblivion......in the media, but especially the young, who are being dealt out of the dying American dream, are looking for alternatives. Anonymous: the modern face of anarchism.. (Photo Page) (image by Pixabay: KlausHausmann)   License   DMCA I have voted for Stein again because we have reached a tipping point, of which the renewed interest in anti-establishment concepts like anarchism are looking attractive to many. The problem is that anararchism is a term so abused that it means, to one, a hippie commune and to another, bomb throwers. I try to define anarchism, provide a historical and philosophical context that places its evolution at the heart of the Left, which up until Bernie Sanders, was Left Out. And that is the condition of the Left today...it doesn't exist except among a minority of writers and other deviants. The Republican Party is totally taken over by the far right, going as far as to deny science, and the triangulated Democratic Party, which went center right under Bill Clinton (and Hillary is no different) as he joined with the Republicans to repeal Glass-Steagall. - Advertisement - Occupy graffiti: the beginning (Photo Page) (image by DrGarageland)   License   DMCA Glass-Steagall " was passed by Congress in 1933 and prohibits commercial banks from engaging in the investment business. It was enacted as an emergency response to the failure of nearly 5,000 banks during the Great Depression." In 1999 Congress passed the Gramm--Leach--Bliley Act, also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, which repealed its key provisions of barring commercial banks from being investment/casino banks. Bill Clinton signed this bill, co-sponsored by 3 Republicans and with a Republican House and Senate, as it was veto proof. Today, both Democrat, Republicans, and the public want to re-instate the wall of separation, which prevents reckless gambling at the public's risk. - Advertisement - Wall Street bombing 1920 wreckage (Photo Page) (image by Wikipedia (commons.wikimedia.org))   License   DMCA Bombing on Wall St.......past protests were robust! Trump's first choice for Secretary of the Treasury, Jaimi Dimon, is the billionaire CEO of the largest bank, JPMorganChase, and he is strongly opposed to bring back the Glass-Steagall separation. f*ck everybody! Wall St. rules. Such attitudes are birthing a new interests in anarchism. And so our next President will be a pathological billionaire pretending to be a populist, whose singular talent is showmanship and whose moral compass is so damaged that he started his campaign by appealing to the declining white poorly educated, offering them a scapegoat for the suffering that oligarchs like Trump, who has outsourced 95% of his jobs to slave labor states, has actually caused. This is somewhat like Hitler pretending to be a "socialist" as he sent the socialists, trade union leaders, and Social Democrats to die at Dachau. Trump will give us peace by choosing the Bush war team, on record of wanting to "Bomb Iran (see John Bolton, possible Secy of State, in his NYTimes op ed from last year). And he will dismantle the oligarchy by having Wall St cut its own throat.

Part I establishes the WHY and WHEN. Part II will explore whether anarchism is just a reaction, a kind of philosophical escape by intellectuals, or a growing movement with actual political power: is it just a mood....or is it the harbinger of a left anti-establishment movement, the counterpart to the Right's move towards the Police State, or as NIxon and now Trump call it, Law and Order. Part II also explores the various meanings of anarchism, on the premise that if we don't define our terms, when anarchism is widely viewed as either bomb-throwing or hippie communes, we won't be talking the same language and agreement will be either impossible or impotently abstract. Undefined terms leads to rhetorical but empty and impotent agreement. What are the varieties of anarchism, and what common ground can the bomb throwers and hippies and all in between find to form not just a mood of rebellion (I will not vote!) but a political movement which can join with the Greens, progressives, and possibly libertarian to take power and.....Make American Great at Last!

So how could anarchists possibly be seeking "actual political power"? Behind all your cartloads of wikipaedia data you live in a fantasy world of imaginary "power" whitewashed with the word 'solidarity'. You don't speak for anarchists because you are not an anarchist. And it is a given among anarchists that no one really speaks for anyone else. You don't speak for anyone but Dale Ruff and that is exactly what drives you up the wall into power fantasy.

But business and banking corporations exercise more mundane and intrusive power over people's economic and financial livelihoods. We do not actually live in a "democratic" society. We live in a "capitalist" society. Capitalism -- like feudalism before it -- is rule by ownership of the economic and financial infrastructure. Corporations own the now-globalized industrial production and distribution systems. Banking corporations own the money issuance and allocation system. Look at your actual life. Everything you do costs money. Only about 3% of the money supply is government/central bank-issued cash money. 97% -- virtually all -- of the money supply is commercial bank credit/debt. Private corporations -- commercial banks -- create the money supply as "loans". Banks "own" the credit-money that they create and "lend". Debtors owe the money supply "back" to the banks that created it. The power to issue and allocate money is the power to financially govern the economic life of nations. Debtors are beholden to creditors. Commercial bankers are the creditors who create the money supply that debtors borrow and spend. Monetary reformers since the 1920s have argued that governments should issue at least some of the national money supply, rather than suffer the private bank monopoly over money. Even if anarchists succeed in instituting a people-serving "democratic" government, the government will have no power (except police/military) unless it captures the money-issuing power from the banks who presently wield it. Otherwise the government is limited to trying to tax money from some people to fund its spending on behalf of other people, which creates a political division between taxpayers and spending recipients. As long as we live in a global economy and enjoy all the hi-tech fruits of corporate production and distribution, a corporate oligarchy "owns" the economy. The device you are reading this on is made of materials sourced by global supply chains. The components were manufactured in several different nations, then shipped to the final assembly plant, then shipped out to ports in every nation on Earth, then shipped by train and truck to a retailer near you. You cannot "democratize" the interlinked globalized corporate-owned industrial production and distribution system. Most of the food that most people eat is produced by agri-corporations, not by local farmers. Without money you can't buy food. Without agri-corps there is no food to buy. Banks own the money system. Corporations own the food production and sales system; and corporations produce and sell most of the other economic necessities and luxuries that we use in our daily lives. "The people" do not directly produce their daily necessities of life. The people are economically ruled by the corporations who own the industries who produce all the stuff that is offered "for sale" in "the economy". The people are financially ruled by the banks who own the money issuance and allocation system. Governments are financially ruled by banks and by "the bond market" (the capital markets). Everybody is ruled by the neoliberal worldview that believes everything "should" be owned and operated by global corporate capitalists. Individuals and small businesses are left to 'compete' in their local and nartional marketplace against billionaire oligopolists with access to global cheap labor and global supply chains. "The people" vote for global oligopolists by shopping at Walmart rather than shopping at a local independent store. The people do this because Walmart is cheaper, and when banks own the money-issuance system, money is always in scarce supply. Who are anarchists revolting against? Governments who have almost no power to govern anything? Or corporations who own the money system and the economy and who exercise economic and financial government over the nations? The boot stamping on the human face is not worn by a politician. It is worn by a corporate oligopolist.

The concept of anarchism being no government has been advanced by its enemies to make it sound absurd. Self-government as in the Kurdish region, in Spain in the 30's, and in thousands of workers coops in the US all have non-hierarchical democratic self-governance. Mondragon in Spain has 90,000 members, all with an equal voice. It is lunatic to suggest they have no government. Famous American anarchists of the libertarian socialist strain have included Bookchin, whose self-government idea is being adopted by the Kurds, Howard Zinn, Noam Chomsky, Gar Alperowitz, and Richard Wolfe. If you are not familiar with their form of anarchism, perhaps it's time to do some homework. Your concept of anarchism is the cartoon version; no serious anarchist movement or community has ever rejected self-government and chosen NO government, which is impossible, since all human cooperation involves decisions which effect the community and must be decided one way or the other, either through a hierarch (like a corporation) or through self-government. I buy my bread (Alvarez Bankery) from an anarchist group that formed in 1982 in Berkeley (where I lived and associated with many fellow anarchists), and they rule through democratic governance, voting on who should manage, what wages should be, etc etc. When a society has no government, no public way of managing affairs, either private parties take control or outsiders raid a community incapable of defending itself. Please allow that I, who have studied anarchism at UC Berkeley and Harvard Grad School of Government and been an anarchist of the lib soc variety for 55 years, am aware of the many varieties, including the right wing cartoon version you claim while denying what anarchists for centuries have written and practiced. You basic error is to confuse self-government with hierarchy: it is a total rejection of hierarchy, from the Diggers through the untopian socialist, the French Revolution (the Paris Commune had its own army, which of course required some form of management, through the libertarian socialist who clashed with the Marxists to the current crop like Bookchin and Chomsky. It is a rich and varied history and culture which you have reduced to an unworkable concept. This Part I is meant to say Why and When anarchism becomes attractive. I wish you would stay on topic. Part II will explore the many varieties, including yours....and you can comment there and present all your knowledge and sources to make your case. Divided we fall; you are rejecting 99% of anarchist history with the effect of a kind of radical purge of most anarchists, including Zinn, Chomsky, Wolf, etc etc. All philosophies of anarchism reject heirarchy (except if temporary and by democratic agreement) as with the need for self-defense, which clearly requires some form of organization. Please do not merely repeat your unsupported opinion, but share us your knowledge of history, philosophy, and practical experiences with anarchism. Anarchism is the rejection of all forms of tyranny and imposed hierarchy, seeking to embrace equality and self-government. This has been the case from the Diggers in the 17th Century to the libertarian socialist communities forming on the basis of Bookchins mutual aid society among some Kurds. Let's not fight; lets express our views, listen to others, and seek solidarity. Join....or die. Thank you for your comment....I hope to hear more when we get to the many varities of anarchism throughout history.

Their original name came from their belief in economic equality based upon a specific passage in the Book of Acts.[4][5] The Diggers tried (by "leveling" land) to reform the existing social order with an agrarian lifestyle based on their ideas for the creation of small egalitarian rural communities.

If you do not read, understand, and accept the wide variety of self-government, you will be sent to the Emma Goldman Finishing School!!! I suggest you stop repeating your dogmatic views and learn. Proudhon, Bukunin, and Thoreau all made important contributions. Bukunin " Bakunin was a Russian revolutionary anarchist, and founder of collectivist anarchism. He is considered among the most influential figures of anarchism, and one of the principal founders of the social anarchist tradition." That is the libertarian socialist strain that I belong to these 55 years. Here is the moment when the libertarian socialist movement named itself and took on "the dictatorship of the proletariat: " The "Bakuninist" or anarcho-socialist trend rapidly expanded in influence, especially in Spain, which constituted the largest section of the International at the time. A showdown loomed with Marx, who was a key figure in the General Council of the International. The 1872 Hague Congress was dominated by a struggle between Marx and his followers, who argued for the use of the state to bring about socialism, and the Bakunin/anarchist faction, which argued instead for the replacement of the state by federations of self-governing workplaces and communes." What anarchist authors do you recommend? Was Bukunin a fake anarchist in your view; were the Spanish anarchists who ran part of Spain for a while fakes? Are Bookchin, Chomksy, Zinn , etc all fakes like me?

The wave of anarchist bombings and assassinations of the 1890s (Auguste Vaillant, Ravachol, Emile Henry, Sante Caserio) and the practice of illegalism from the mid-1880s to the start of the First World War (Cle'ment Duval, Pini, Marius Jacob, the Bonnot gang) were twin aspects of the same proletarian offensive, but were expressed in an individualist practice, one that complemented the great collective struggles against capital."

My goal is to let anarchists speak for themselves...so here is Proudhon's set of options, from Principles of Anarchism: Regime of Authority 1. Government of all by one - monarchy 2. Government of all by all - communism Regime of Liberty 1. Government of all by each - democracy 2. Government of each by each - anarchy or self-government Perhaps the most biting criticism of anarchism was Robert Michaels who wrote The Iron Law of Oligarchy: " The "iron law of oligarchy" states that all forms of organization, regardless of how democratic they may be at the start, will eventually and inevitably develop oligarchictendencies, thus making true democracy practically and theoretically impossible, especially in large groups and complex organizations." This thesis led him eventually disown democracy and self-government and turn to fascism. Absolutists who reject all forms of government, including self-government, are the pain in the ass of the movement, as they represent not a process of transforming power into a democratic operation of equals but denounce all forms of self-government. Such absolutists have never once created a viable community. None the founders of modern anarchism were dogmatists but rejected the dogmatism of the Marxists, for instance, while sharing their common view of capitalism and the need for a new society based on equality. They differed on the means. Absolutism tends to The "iron law of oligarchy" states that all forms of organization, regardless of how democratic they may be at the start, will eventually and inevitably develop oligarchictendencies, thus making true democracy practically and theoretically impossible, especially in large groups and complex organizations." Absolutists who claim the one true anarchism have never created a viable community (the world has tens of thousands of worker coops using self-government to manage affairs) and tend to purge anyone who disagrees with their absolute beliefs. All the great modern anarchists believed in a process of eliminating Authority and Hierarchy and replacing it with Self-government, which is how every one of those tens of thousands coops works.

I agree with much of what you say, but we cannot have a meaningful discussion to build a unified anarchist movement. In my view, corporations are totalitarian in nature as they govern most of our waking lives and even tell when we can sleep, have lunch, etc. They are unaccountable except where government has created worker's rights, such as the co-determination programs in Northern Europe, Germany, etc, where workers are on the Board of Directors of private corporations and have a voice in management. For instance, if a recession comes, most US corporations will lay off workers, sometimes by the tens of thousands...or just sent them off to slave labor nations (Trump's clothing is made by garment workers in Bangladesh who make $50 a month and work in unsafe conditions----as part of the race to the bottom in terms of labor and health and safety. In 2012, over 100 died in a garment sweatshop fire, and in February another fire injured many. In Germany, the workers would never vote to outsource their jobs, and if revenue fell, they would not fire 10% of the workers but rather likely vote to take a 10% reduction in pay with 10% fewer hours worked. It's still a capitalist system but state laws force the corporations to share power (and profits, thru workers voices) with labor. That is the best a restrained capitalism has done this far. I want to go further, to a system in which workers coops, ESOPS, and non-profits expand democracy into the workplace and economy. Credit unions are non-profits with 90 million members; they did not collapse during the Great REcession, since they did not mingle casino gambling with normal commercial banking operations. Also municipal and state banks, as in North Dakota (which has never failed in 80 yrs), can represent ordinary people rather than rich owners and investors. There are many ways to move beyond capitalism, and the youth have already done so, since a Gallup poll in 2011 found they favored socialism over capitalism, and this year, all the polls showed that in a matchup, Sanders, a lifelong socialists of the mild social democratic variety, beat Clinton handily and crushed Trump. The times, they are a changin......we are primed to win in 2020 with a progressive President to represent the American people, most of whom are progressive according to all polls and support for single payer, raising the minimum wage, universal background checks, etc etc. Our times has come, not a minute too soon, as I am 75.

Local-currency bonds fall the most since 2008 financial crisis Currency volatility and hedging costs show no sign of panic Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp The selloff in emerging markets after Donald Trump’s U.S. presidential election was intense. A closer look reveals that things aren’t as bad as they might seem. While local-currency bonds suffered their biggest losses last week since 2008 following the Republican’s surprise victory, a gauge of volatility in developing-market currencies remained 16 percent below the levels seen in February. The cost to hedge against foreign-exchange losses is 38 percent cheaper than it was in August 2015 when China’s yuan devaluation rattled global investors. In a global bond selloff fueled by expectations that Trump will increase government spending, emerging-market traders are by no means capitulating. While bracing for the risks of protectionist policies, they’re betting faster growth and narrowing current-account deficits will help most developing countries weather the rout. The recent declines have “created a great buying opportunity,” said Koon Chow, a strategist at Union Bancaire Privee Ubp SA in London. “We could get to the stage where, in one or two weeks time, U.S. Treasury yields stabilize, and if that happens, emerging markets will come back.” While it’s too early to call a bottom, Chow said domestic bonds in Brazil and Russia start to look attractive, together with the Colombian and Peruvian currencies. Asian exchange rates are likely to remain under pressure, he said. More than $1.2 trillion was wiped off the value of global bonds last week as Trump’s win bolstered the view that a government spending splurge may accelerate U.S. growth and inflation.  Emerging markets were among the hardest-hit as the real-estate mogul pledged on the campaign trail to pull America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, brand China a currency manipulator and build a wall along the border with Mexico. Restrained Selling Since the Nov. 8 election, developing-nation local-currency bonds have tumbled 7.3 percent through Nov. 11, the biggest three-day slump since October 2008. The decline cut the bonds’ return this year to 8.5 percent. Investors yanked a record $301 million from BlackRock Inc.’s $8.9 billion emerging-market fixed-income fund on Nov. 10. On Monday, U.S. 30-year yields rose to 3 percent for the first time since January. In the currency market, Mexico’s peso plunged 12 percent to a record while the Brazilian real and South Africa’s rand have lost more than 7.8 percent each. On Monday, the Malaysian ringgit sank to a nine-month low and South Korea’s won depreciated to the weakest since June. Still, there are indications that the selloff may be limited. While hedging costs in the currency market increased to a five-month high of 4.3 percent on Nov. 10, they were lower than those of 6.9 percent in August 2015, according to data compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co. At 11.3 percent, JPMorgan’s gauge of currency volatility is below this year’s high of 13.4 percent set in February. Stronger Fundamentals One reason is that emerging-market countries are on a stronger footing now compared with three years ago during the so-called taper tantrum when then Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke’s signal to reduce monetary stimulus sent a shock wave through global markets. Developing-nation local-currency bonds lost about 16 percent in less than four months. Economic growth is picking up this year for the first time since 2010, with Brazil and Russia digging themselves out of recessions, the International Monetary Fund estimates. The average shortfall of current accounts in South Africa, Brazil, Turkey, India and Indonesia, a group branded as the “fragile five” by Morgan Stanley in 2013, has shrunk to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product, from a record 5 percent in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Foreign reserves have increased in countries including Indonesia and India, providing them with ammunition to defend their currencies. “Fundamentals are much stronger than going into the taper tantrum.” said Paul McNamara, a money manager at GAM UK Ltd. The selloff “just strikes me as a little bit extreme,” he said. Strategists at Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. warn that the rout is likely to deepen. Trump’s protectionist overtures, if acted upon, would slow exports from and reduce investments to developing markets, they say. In addition, central banks in the U.S., Europe and Japan are either ready to raise borrowing costs or stop easing further, dragging Treasuries yields up and putting pressure on emerging markets, Citigroup’s analyst Dirk Willer wrote in a note Friday. Local debt in Mexico, Poland and Hungary are most vulnerable to rising U.S. yields, he said. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate that investors are overweighting domestic bonds and have hedged between about 10 percent and 30 percent of their currency exposure in Brazil, Indonesia, Russia and South Africa. If the selloff extends, investors may have to cut their holdings and increase their purchases of insurance, exacerbating the decline. For now, McNamara said he’s willing to give Trump the benefit of the doubt. He’s looking to buy the South African rand once there’s some clarity about the direction of the new U.S. government. “We just sit tight at the moment,” said McNamara, whose Julius Baer Local Emerging Bond Fund returned 13 percent this year. “All the negative is based on various assumptions. We’ve got very little hard evidence in terms of what the new administration is going to mean for emerging markets.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

It is seeking to list its American depositary receipts on the Nasdaq under the symbol TRVG, according to a regulatory filing. Trivago will have two classes of shares after the offering. The company plans on selling Class A shares to the public, according to the filing. Those shares are currently held by Trivago management including Rolf Schroemgens, Peter Vinnemeier and Malte Siewert. Class B shares will be held solely by Expedia, which doesn’t plan to sell its stake. Expedia first bought into Trivago in 2012, paying about $628 million in cash and stock for 61.6 percent of the company. The acquisition was part of a push by Expedia to expand its presence in Europe. Trivago posted a net loss of $57.8 million on revenue of $425.6 million in the first nine months of this year, according to the filing.

So it was that in the days following Donald Trump’s data-defying upset in the presidential election, even the Masters of the Universe were struggling to comprehend the course of human events. “A Trump rally?” repeated Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein Thursday, after Andrew Ross Sorkin, the host of the Times’ annual “DealBook” conference for market movers and shakers, asked him about what some pundits had termed the market’s unexpectedly buoyant reaction to the news. “Oh, no, in the market,” said Blankfein, a Clinton supporter whose face Trump had actually used in an anti-elites campaign ad and who had certainly never shown it at one of Trump’s notoriously boisterous campaign events. The audience laughed weakly. The mood was, as one investment banker put it, “manic depressive.” PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi and Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz had railed against the president-elect’s sexism and racism, respectively, but said they were hoping for the best. “It’s a great day to be an American,” said the CEO of Oppenheimer Funds, a sponsor, in his speech.​ ​“​Fully half the country thinks we are going to hell​.” For his part, Blankfein said, he was “of course” no​t totally caught off guard by Trump’s win​ — ​​Goldman Sachs, after all,​ ​is well ​known for keeping a position on both sides of the deal​​. But he was surprised that the “jarring moment” when markets dipped on the news only lasted a short while​​. “​H​is policies are market-supportive,” he said with a shrug. “Market-friendly.” So far as anyone understood what Trum​p’s policies were, that is. “He really hasn’t put out any sort of cogent policy on anything,” one investment banker told me.​ ​Over lunch at the conference (roast beef and salmon), the banker, who is from Israel, was attempting to make sense of ​ ​the crumbs the candidate had laid out on the campaign trail along with another banker, who had flown in from Texas. “Lower taxes,” said Israel. “Lighter regulation.” “The feeling was that Hillary was going to have a lot more control, and now the markets are going to be rather unfettered,” explained Texas. (In the financial industry, this is viewed as a good thing.) Trump’s promise to repeal all or parts of Dodd-Frank and suggestions that he would also defang the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau struck them both as unrealistic. They, like others at the conference, were not convinced that Trump would, as he promised, institute “a 21st-century Glass-Steagall,” a law separating commercial and investment banks repealed by Bill Clinton in 1993. (“That omelette’s been made, that toothpaste is out of the tube, pick your metaphor,” observed Blankfein; Goldman Sachs opened retail operations this year.) “The plans, such as he has, don’t add up,” said Israel, pointing out that the fear could be seen in the bond market, which was plummeting in reaction to Trump’s nebulous comments on trade and immigration restriction, contributing to a sense that inflation was on its way. “When he talks about restrictions on trade, bringing jobs back that were lost — those jobs were not lost because of international trade. Everything will just become more expensive. Do we really want to go back to the way the U.S. was in 1960, where the cars were terrible, where the appliances were terrible?” he asked rhetorically. It was clear he was entering the depressive phase. “When did things get better? When competition came in.” Or repealing Obamacare. Texas couldn’t see how you can just end it, since millions of people are using it. Though he’s never been particularly fond of the program. “Congress kind of mucked it up, and you have the worst of everything,” he said. “It’s like that expression, ‘What’s a camel? It’s a horse designed by committee.’ ” “They are actually very efficient creatures,” said Israel, who then ​​slouched off, despondent, to get a cookie from the dessert bar. ​ Elsewhere, the pendulum was swinging toward manic​. “​My own I guess/optimistic take is that he will dial it all down a bunch,” one young hedge-funder told me of Trump​. “He’ll have a bunch of more Establishment Republicans running the show, and he’ll just turn into America’s cheerleader.” And when Bill Ackman, the activist hedge-fund manager who lost more than a billion dollars this past year on notorious pharmaceuticals giant Valeant, took the stage that afternoon, he was practically ebullient. “I woke up extremely bullish on Trump,” said Ackman. (Who, it should be noted, had also woken up to a pharmaceuticals sector that bounced on the defeat of Clinton, who had vowed to fight price-­gouging.) “It did occur to me on Tuesday night that some people might react to this positively,” said Richard Socarides, a Clinton adviser turned business consultant, as he filled his plate at the buffet line, adding that he was going through something that felt like the five stages of grief and was today feeling “sad with touches of anger.” He did not agree with Israel’s statement that the United States was “too great” to be destroyed by one person. “I think, long term, the risks to our economy are severe,” he said. “The United States for the last 50 to 75 years has been the central organizing and stabilizing force in the global economy, the safety net for people who believe there should be human rights and democracy and freedom and open markets and capitalism. If that underpinning of the global economy starts to be shaken, anything could happen.” As the day went on, the rumor that the incipient Trump administration was considering JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon for Treasury secretary circulated through the crowd. “He’d be a great Treasury secretary,” said Blankfein, Dimon’s arch-rival, adding that for him, it would be “good to kill two birds with one stone.” But the appointment of Dimon, who is not only Wall Street Establishment but an old Obama ally — would likely annoy the populace to whom Trump promised change. “He wants to be popular with everyone, but he also needs to stay popular with the people who elected him,” said Socarides, turning over the one facet of The Donald’s personality everyone is sure of: his narcissism. “And those people are not going to be happy if he doesn’t do what he said he was going to do. But if he does do what he said he was going to do, we are all in big trouble. But!” he said, his mood swinging, at least for a second, to the other side: “He could surprise us! It could be fantastic.” *This article appears in the November 14, 2016, issue of New York Magazine.

REUTERS/Michaela Rehle By Maria Sheahan | FRANKFURT FRANKFURT German engineering group Siemens (SIEGn.DE) has agreed to buy U.S.-based Mentor Graphics (MENT.O) in a $4.5 billion deal that will bolster its industrial software operations and help it keep pace with changes to manufacturing technology. Siemens will pay Mentor Graphics shareholders $37.25 per share, a 21-percent premium to Friday's closing price, and expects to fund the deal from cash reserves, it said on Monday. Siemens Chief Executive Joe Kaeser has set out to reshape the group, a household name in Germany, to make it more profitable and agile by selling off non-core businesses and investing in areas such as software that promise faster growth and fatter margins. Kaeser has so far managed to reassure investors that he will improve on his predecessor Peter Loescher's weak track record on making acquisitions pay off in the longer run. Mentor Graphics makes software that helps semiconductor companies design and test their chips before they manufacture them and represents Siemens's biggest deal in the industrial software sector since it bought UGS for $3.5 billion in 2007. Siemens said it now had all software that its customers needed to develop complex electronic machinery such as aeroplanes, trains and cars. "Our customers are driving a paradigm shift toward more and more complex and smart connected products such as autonomous vehicles," Siemens finance chief Ralf Thomas told analysts and journalists during a conference call on Monday. "This acquisition is our answer to this development," he added. Baader Helvea analyst Guenther Hollfelder, who has a "buy" recommendation on Siemens shares, said the acquisition did not appear overly expensive at a valuation of 18.5 times operating profit. ACTIVIST SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT Shares in Mentor Graphics jumped 18.5 percent to $36.37 in early U.S. trading, while Siemens was 1.1 percent higher by 1435 GMT. Mentor Graphics has been under pressure since activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp reported an 8.1 percent stake in the company in September and said its shares were deeply undervalued. Elliott said on Monday it supported the deal and saw it as "great outcome" for Mentor Graphics' shareholders and customers. People familiar with the matter had flagged the planned deal to Reuters, saying Siemens would pay $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion for Mentor Graphics, which competes with Synopsys (SNPS.O) and Cadence (CDNS.O). Siemens said last week that it planned a public listing of its $15 billion healthcare business, which pushed its shares to a 16-year high as investors hoped for an injection of capital to boost its valuation while funding new investments. Siemens said it expected the acquisition to add to its earnings per share within three years and to lift earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) by more than 100 million euros ($107.21 million) within four years. About half of the earnings boost will come from revenue synergies and the other half from lower costs, including from some job cuts, Siemens CFO Thomas said. The deal will boost its software revenue by about a third from 3.3 billion euros, to around 6 percent of group revenue. Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan advised Siemens on the transaction, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2017. Bank of America advised Mentor Graphics.
