And you won't find a big gold statue of Prometheus. But when JPMorgan Chase opens its new Plano campus in 2018, the planners for the 1.4 million -square-foot project hopes to take some design cues from New York City's landmark Rockefeller Center. David Arena, head of global real estate for JPMorgan Chase told developers meeting in Dallas Tuesday that planners for Chase's new 6-building office campus near the Dallas North Tollway studied great urban landscapes when laying out the project which is part of the $3 billion Legacy West development. "At Legacy West we studied some of the best street thoroughfares in the world," Arena said at a meeting of the Urban Land Institute, the country's largest commercial real estate organization. "We more our less copied the distance at Rockefeller Center where the channel gardens are to try and create more animation and a streetscape." Designed by Dallas architect HKS, Chase's 49-acre campus just south of State Highway 121 includes office buildings, parking garages and open space. The channel gardens Arena referenced include landscaping, fountains and walkways and run between the high-rise buildings fronting on Fifth Avenue. Chase's new Plano campus - being developed by KDC - will house about 6,000 workers when it opens. Planners for Chase's new campus in Plano studied pedestrian areas in New York's Rockefeller Center.

There are multiple reasons to conclude that JPMorgan Chase is a great stock for beginning investors. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 25, 2016 at 12:42PM Chase Tower in Phoenix, Arizona. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Beginning investors should wade carefully into stocks, picking ones that minimize the risk of capital loss while at the same time offering a reasonable opportunity for future gains. One bank stock that meets this criteria is JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Why JPMorgan Chase is good for beginning investors With $2.5 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet, JPMorgan Chase is the biggest bank in America. This gives it the resources needed to stay on the cutting edge of the financial services industry, which is under assault right now from financial technology companies. JPMorgan Chase's heft also offers economies of scale -- the bigger a company is, the easier it is to operate efficiently. In the third quarter of this year, JPMorgan Chase's operating expenses consumed 59% of its net revenue. Most other banks tend to spend well over 60% of their revenue operating their businesses. Thanks in part to its size, moreover, JPMorgan Chase's stock is highly liquid. An average of 13.5 million of its shares have traded hands each day over the past three months. If you were to buy shares of the New York-based bank, you can thus rest assured that you won't have any problem subsequently unloading them. The 10 Biggest Banks in America from John J. Maxfield. JPMorgan Chase is one of the most stable banks in the United States, too. Its performance through the financial crisis confirmed this. While hundreds of banks failed in the downturn, and countless others would have failed but for the government's assistance, JPMorgan Chase was in such a strong position that it not only survived the crisis, but actually thrived because of it. In 2008, the government went to the Jamie Dimon-led bank and asked for its help in rescuing Bear Stearns, the fifth largest stand-alone investment bank at the time. Later that same year, JPMorgan Chase stepped in to rescue Washington Mutual as well, taking the by-then failed savings and loan institution off the FDIC's hands. Finally, though not unrelated to the first four points, JPMorgan Chase is very capably run. Its CEO, Dimon, may be the finest banker of this generation. And you needn't take my word for it. Warren Buffett has repeatedly expressed admiration for Dimon, calling the bank CEO's latest interview "off the charts." Not coincidentally, one of Buffett's lieutenants at Berkshire Hathaway recently joined the JPMorgan Chase board. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. Risks related to JPMorgan Chase stock There are of course risks associated with JPMorgan Chase. Regulators have expressed in the past that they want universal banks (banks such as JPMorgan with both investment and commercial banking operations) to simplify their business models. One way regulators are attempting to accomplish this is to put added regulatory pressure on the nation's biggest banks, which could thereby depress their profits. Along these same lines, banks that have major Wall Street operations, as JPMorgan Chase does, face heightened risk from their trading activities. JPMorgan Chase learned this first hand in 2012, when a single trader in its London offices lost over $6 billion by making a wrong-way bet on derivatives tied to the health of American corporations. That said, Dimon is reputed to be obsessive about risk, and, at least in my opinion, there's every reason to believe that the bank's mistake four years ago won't be repeated anytime soon. This means that the primary driver of JPMorgan's earnings going forward will be higher interest rates, which are bound to materialize at some point. In short, if you're looking for a good bank stock to buy as a beginning investor, you could do a whole lot worse than starting at the top with JPMorgan Chase.

Eric Volkman (TMFVolkman) Oct 25, 2016 at 6:25AM We're still some time away from the end of the year, but it's safe to say that 2016 probably won't be a banner year for banking stocks. Still-thin interest rates, fallout from the Brexit vote earlier this year, and concerns about consumer borrowing have dampened share prices in the sector. The recent Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC) scandal hasn't helped the reputation of the sector, either. But the current unpopularity of banking stocks opens good opportunities to buy shares of some of the more solid lenders. Here are two banks I think are more than worthy of investment these days. Image source: Getty Images JPMorgan Chase Of the "big four" monster incumbent banks, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is best in class. Thanks to the Wells Fargo debacle, the company is now the largest of the quartet in terms of market capitalization in the U.S. JPMorgan Chase also tops the rest of the pack in terms of trailing 12-month revenue and net profit. The lender's key metrics are all going in the right direction. In its recently released Q3 results, it posted an encouraging 8% year-over-year improvement in total revenue (to almost $25 billion). Net profit dropped by the same amount (to nearly $6.3 billion), but that slide is on the back of a $2.2 billion tax benefit it booked in Q3 2015 that skews the comparison. Regardless, the resulting per-share net of $1.58 was well above the $1.39 expected by the market; the top line figure also beat estimates. Investment banking was the secret sauce flavoring those tasty results. JPMorgan Chase has one of the most robust IB operations among the incumbents. The segment is rather boom-and-bust -- and in Q3 it was very much the former, with the bank posting its best-ever Q3 revenue figure. To me, the company's investment banking arm isn't overwhelming relative to its size, so its downside is mitigated by the company's other operations. And when it does well, as it did this past quarter, the upside can juice overall results nicely. Finally, in a sector that can be fairly stingy with dividends, JPMorgan Chase pays out well. The company's distribution currently yields 2.8%, second only among the Big Four to beaten-down Wells Fargo, and notably higher than the payouts of Bank of America and Citigroup. Capital One Financial Over the years, Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF) has grown from Yet Another Credit Card Issuer to a multifaceted financial services company. Although it still draws the bulk of its net revenue from card operations, those banking activities have grown to comprise nearly 40% of that line item these days. Auto loans in particular have been a good lending segment of late: On the back of growing vehicle sales, the company increased its originations by 20% on a year-over-year basis in its most recently reported quarter. Speaking of that period, although Capital One missed expectations for both net revenue and net profit, the former advanced a robust 10% (to $6.25 billion). And the 4% decline in adjusted bottom line wasn't too worrying, because the company still landed well in the black at $979 million. Total assets saw a 9% rise, while deposits went north at a 6% pace. The company's business mix is unique among the nation's top lenders, if not necessarily a hit with the market lately because of worries about credit card risk (and, to a lesser degree, the impact on auto lending from vehicle sales growth, which is starting to slow). Those concerns are valid, but in the card sphere I feel that Capital One is a veteran issuer that has proven its worth as a risk manager. As for auto loans, its originations are outpacing recent vehicle sales growth, so I'd fully expect the company to keep performing in that segment. Meanwhile, like JPMorgan Chase, Capital One doesn't skimp on the dividend. Its payout annualizes to $1.60, good enough for a 2.2% yield -- relatively generous for the banking sector.

Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website 7  +  9  =  Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Keith Fitz-Gerald I just spotted the next global "black swan." But I think it actually looks like a giant Pteranodon. I'm talking about so-called "death derivatives." The Lowdown on "Death Derivatives" After betting trillions on everything from liar loans to mortgages that never should have been issued in the first place, the big banks are back and they're betting on death – yours and mine. It seems that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS), JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM), Deutsche Bank AG (NYSE: DB) and others now want to help securitize "longevity risk" through a newly created derivatives market. I don't know whether to laugh or cry. Here's the deal. The banks want to collect billions in fees from pension funds and other institutions by issuing insurance that will manage the risks associated with living longer than the financial planners planned. What Wall Street is proposing is to package up the fees from these instruments into bonds that are then securitized and sold to investors via a secondary marketplace the banks themselves will effectively create – a "death derivatives" market. You might think this is farfetched, but the idea is actually far enough along that several financial institutions have already created mortality -rate indices that will be used to price and trade these death instruments. For example, David Blake, director of the pensions institute at the London-based Cass Business School, helped JPMorgan and Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE ADR: CS) develop mortality indices for the United States, Germany, the Netherlands and Wales in 2007. He told Bloomberg that this is to help buyers and sellers price derivatives more accurately and to boost confidence to create a more liquid market. In my mind's eye, I can see and hear the nightly business news report that would result: "The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 200 points in trading today, while the death-note index spiked another 53 points on news that the nation's new healthcare plan failed to prevent market-related heart attacks." Or how about this one: "In an effort to maintain profitability and meet future liabilities, the Dewey, Cheatem and Howe Insurance Co. late today bumped off another class of policyholders. This continues a recent trend that began due to pressure from some of Wall Street's leading investment banks." The conspiracy theorists are going to go nuts. While I can understand the desire these companies have to offset the financial risks of living longer, we need to take a step back here and remember that we've been down this path before. And that "path" abruptly ended at a sheer cliff. Right now, the worldwide derivatives market is valued between a "conservative" $600 trillion and a potential peak of $1.5 quadrillion dollars, according to the latest research – but nobody knows for sure because so much of the market is totally unregulated even at this stage of the game. You'd think global regulators would have figured out that these things are bad news. But that's not the case at all. As a result … well, here we go again. The bottom line: There literally isn't enough money on the planet to bail out this market if or (more accurately) when it goes bad. And the last thing we need is more self-dealing derivatives and yet another set of financial instruments banks can "trade" amongst themselves – with very little, if any oversight. I find it particularly troubling that these instruments are being designed from the get-go to be traded off bank balance sheets, meaning there will be virtually no capital-reserve requirements. Talk about playing with fire. The Death-Derivatives Dilemma What's happened here actually is very simple. Thanks to better medicine, better diets and simple science, people are living longer and the companies that are responsible for pension plans and insurance payouts didn't plan for this. So they've got hefty future payments to make up. Every year of additional life expectancy typically adds as much as 4% to future pension requirements, according to Dutch insurer Aegon NV (NYSE ADR: AEG). Aegon said last week that money set aside to cover policyholders in the Netherlands, who are living longer than expected, resulted in a 12% hit to its first-quarter profits. Enter death derivatives. With these new instruments, if retirees die sooner than expected, the investors who buy the "death notes" profit. If those retirees live longer, investors will have to cough up the additional money needed to pay them off. In the meantime, they're holding "bonds," for lack of a better term, that pay 5% to 8% a year for 20 years. But here's the thing: Insurance companies have to meet reserve requirements and the money that funds their policies has to come from somewhere. This is why these types of companies "reserve" a portion of their policy premiums and overall earnings against future capital needs. I call this the "death-note dilemma," and it is actually quite a fine line. If these companies put too much money into reserves, they blow their quarterly or annual earnings – and investors don't like that. If they put too little into their reserves – and end up being "underfunded" – their policyholders won't have the money available to them when they need and expect it. Enter Wall Street. By taking the "death notes" into the financial markets, the companies now shunt risk to the rest of us, while placing bets that have nothing to do with stocks, bonds or even national debt. In other words, instead of trading risks between the pension fund and its pensioners, these notes allow investors to speculate on individuals over whom they have no vested economic interest in keeping alive. This is like buying fire insurance on your neighbor's house. Instead of safeguarding that property – as you would your own – you have every incentive to burn it down so that you might collect your payout. What's more, by creating vehicles outside the system that are self-priced and self-regulated, there are no capital requirements, no regulated exchanges, and almost no laws capable of restraining (or even assessing) the risks being taken – that is, until the very same companies that stand to collect billions in fees by selling these things for the next 20 years blow up and the rest of us have to bail them out … again! Even at the government's pathetically understated and completely manipulated 2.9% core inflation rate, $17 trillion turns into $30 trillion in 20 years. At the more realistic 9% rate that we're all feeling in our wallets right now, that same $17 trillion turns into $95.27 trillion within the very same time frame. And once a pension fund or other financial institution purchases one of these ticking financial time bombs, they're on the hook for an instrument that they can't adequately value, probably can't sell and, at a time of crisis, almost assuredly won't be able to unwind. That makes the so-called "counterparty risk" even riskier. The industry and the banks maintain the risks are somehow low or manageable because insurance companies don't go bust. But they do – the collapses of American International Group Inc. (NYSE: AIG) and Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc. (PINK: LEHMQ) are tangible evidence of that reality. How to Solve the Death-Derivatives Dilemma So now what? The way I see it, regulators the world over need to act — and act quickly. The very same companies that have already taken the world on a white-knuckle ride that it neither signed up for nor deserved will do it again. The solution is actually very simple. Instead of trying to regulate entities or markets, the powers that be need to regulate businesses by function. In this case, it doesn't matter if you call the "death note" a swap, a policy, an option, a bond or a cumquat. If the payout is based on the probability of some event occurring, that's insurance by any other name and it needs to be regulated as such – with the appropriate level of reserves to back it up. Absent that, these Wall Street "players" (and I imbue that term with all the scorn that is warranted) will once again gorge themselves – gambling on conditions they can't quantify by using self-created instruments that have no transparently determinable economic value and no clearly defined risks … but for which the entire global economy has been conscripted without its knowledge. That's one bet I don't want to make based simply on my own mortality. And it's sure as hell a bet I don't want somebody making on me in the name of profits.

Derivatives are a zero sum game. Somebody's gotta win and somebody's gotta lose. A pension fund that buys longevity bonds will win if people live longer than expected; however, those winnings are simply to cover the "loss" of having to pay pensions for longer than you expected. But if people don't live longer than expected, they are only out the fees paid for owning the derivative. So this is not a bet that will cause insurance companies to croak. It's actually making them safer. So the question is who is on the other side of this bet? And how are they going to come up with the funds should people live longer than expected. And why would that not be pure speculation? If the counter parties are large institutions, this would be a problem because small changes in mortality can have huge impacts on its balance sheet. It would only work if those counter-parties somehow profit when people more rapidly than expected. Unfortunately, I can't think of a natural counter-party for this type of risk. Reply Rocco | May 24, 2011 Not surprised but still deserves a "Wow". So, do you think any regulation of the markets would be necessary if Government has not consistently proven to be the bail out king…if moral hazard was allowed to play a role and inflict the pain on these financial (or should I say Gambling) institutions that they should have felt would they even consider building these houses of cards? I understand the pension side of this but do you think they will look at betting on whole life insurance policies too? Reply Denise | May 24, 2011 Holy Cow! I can't believe that there are zero responses! Are people that detached from what's going on? I'm beyond concerned for the future of our country. Reply db | May 24, 2011 I'll short American Death & long African, essentailly betting that Americans will live too long & Africans die too quickly. Reply Jeff Pluim | May 24, 2011 Futurists have predicted that there are people alive today who will be alive 2,000 years from today. I have been following the advances in genetic medicine. When geneticists overcome a single challenge of extending the ends of the DNA strands, and I believe that they are very close, those futurists' predictions will all come true. Because such an advance in human longevity seems unlikely, to the uninitiated who have not followed these advances in DNA medicine, these new derivatives will have the issuers caught with their pants down, and the taxpayer will end up holding the bag again. Reply John O'Connell | May 24, 2011 You've hit it on the head: it's insurance, and there should be reserves to cover losses. There is already a reinsurance marketplace, and we don't need this. However, if there are people who want to do this stuff, and they may go broke, or cause others to go broke, then let them. Just keep them out of the government-supported universe of banks and insurance companies. And if they go broke, so be it. And if someone else invests in them, and loses money, that's fine, too, but we don't allow our government-supported/insured/subsidized banks and industries do that. Goldman Sachs and their ilk need to either stop doing things like this, or get off the public dole and do it on their own dime. Divest their FDIC-insured commercial banking business, so that if they go broke it's none of our business. Reply we | May 24, 2011 600 Trillionj????? who does your RESEARCH?? Reply Frank | May 27, 2011 So when it starts to unravel down the road, when morals are likely to be worse than they are now it will be profitable to 'get rid' of the problem. I wonder what tool they will use? GMOs perhaps. Reply Aussie Mick | May 28, 2011 Best bet would be to give control of death derivitives to J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, Citibank and Wall St….look at how they manipulate the silver, gold, oil and other commodities markets..hate to see them miss out on a bit of 'extra' revenue…the boss would be upset (don't upset the Rockerfellers). Don't think their morals are likely to get worse…that is not possible. Reply David Mortimer | May 28, 2011 Thanks for this piece, Keith. You are a man of many parts. The article makes me very angry and fills me with frustration. I live in Australia and am too far from the action to have any effect on outcomes. We rely on the good old American common sense and values of what is right. Please bring these values to bear on the Vampire Squids. Reply norman cartmell | May 30, 2011 I think derivaties should be regulated otherwise in a few years time we are going to be in a mess again.All the greedy bankers care about are big profits they dont care about the ordinary guy in the street who are suffering because of there gambling.

(Reuters/Kim Hong-Ji) Share Written by Eshe Nelson October 24, 2016 The fallout from Samsung’s exploding Galaxy Note 7 smartphones could go well beyond Samsung. The fiasco of the Korean company’s recall, replacement, and then recall again of the fire-prone phones could affect the entire country’s stock market. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the US, downgraded their position on Korean equities to underweight because of the Galaxy Note troubles, Jan Loeys, the firm’s chief market strategist, noted last week. Samsung makes up 18% of KOSPI, the Korean stock market, and so its relative size can influence investors’ perceptions of the whole market. Meanwhile, JPMorgan has upgraded its outlook for Taiwanese stocks—on the assumption that Apple will benefit from the demise of this challenger smartphone. (Many of the companies in Apple’s supply chain are based in Taiwan.) You can see the fortunes of the two countries’ stock markets diverging in the past month, in time with the changing prospects of Samsung and Apple. Samsung’s share price has dropped about 3% since Oct. 11, when the company said it was halting all sales of the phone, which many airlines have banned passengers from carrying. A recent regulatory filing suggests the disaster could cost Samsung $2.3 billion in lost profits. We will know more when the company reports third-quarter earnings later this week. For Apple, orders for new iPhones exceeded analysts’ expectations in September and pushed up the share price of the US tech company. The Taiwanese stock market could get another boost tomorrow (Oct. 25) when Apple reports its latest quarterly earnings. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

It could be investment banking giant Goldman Sachs. AT&T’s more than $85 billion deal — $107 billion if debt is included — for Time Warner will lead to big advisory fees for Wall Street firms. But Goldman Sachs was notably shut out of the deal. According to regulatory filings about the blockbuster merger, boutique media banking firm Allen & Co, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley advised Time Warner. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch unit and another smaller specialty investment bank, Perella Weinberg, were the advisers to AT&T. BofA and JPMorgan also provided $40 billion in loans to AT&T for the deal. The fact that many of Goldman’s rivals are taking part in the Ma Bell-Time Warner hookup is hurting the Vampire Squid in the latest rankings of investment banks. Before the AT&T-Time Warner announcement, Goldman Sachs was ranked first in the so-called league tables, which ranks investment bankers based on the value of the deals it is working on that have been announced so far this year. But once you add the AT&T-Time Warner deal to the mix, both Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase vault ahead of Goldman Sachs, according to figures from Thomson Reuters. Morgan Stanley is now working on deals in the U.S. worth more than $408 billion. JPMorgan Chase’s deal volume totals $393 billion. Goldman remains stuck at $383 billion. And BofA, which remained in fourth, is now less than $8 billion behind Goldman in deal volume. The league tables represent bragging rights for Wall Street bankers. Merger fees are also based partly on the size of deals too. Goldman often finds itself on top of these rankings — so that is good for both its image and bottom line. So with just a little more than two months left to go in the year, it looks like Goldman is going to need to get working on more high profile deals if it wants to pull ahead of its two big rivals.

By Ben White and Andrew Hanna 10/24/16 08:00 AM EDT AT&T-TIME WARNER DEAL DOOMED? — Via a D.C. lobbyist: “If history is any guide, millions of dollars will be spent on lobbying the WH, Congress & key committees to nudge the merger towards approval. But anyone paying close attention to recent mega-telecom match-ups will realize that the FCC has managed a very tight inter-agency process that has kept outside political influences at bay. “Sometimes in the past the announcement of a potential merger began what was essentially a negotiation with the FCC on pricing, public access, etc. That system no longer rules…… If the application itself is wanting, marketplace actions taken in contemplation of FCC approval will have zero impact on the government's deliberations. FCC commissioners and staff are no longer messing around.” Story Continued Below CAVEAT … It’s not certain the FCC will even get the chance to shut the deal down (more on this below). TRUMP TEAM SAYS NO WAY — WSJ’s Bob Davis: “AT&T Inc.’s blockbuster weekend bid to purchase Time Warner Inc. quickly turned into a election-year issue, with Donald Trump’s campaign vowing to block the deal as part of an effort to use antitrust law to make it harder for big corporations to deepen their control over information. “‘We need a new way of looking at mergers that go beyond traditional model of oligopoly effect on price, quantity and economic efficiency,’ University of California at Irvine economist Peter Navarro, a senior advisor to the Republican presidential candidate, said in an interview. Mr. Navarro said regulators also need to look at the ‘effects of oligopoly on freedom of thought and influencing narratives that influence political process in ways that promote the agendas of the media conglomerates’” Read more. KAINE ALSO HAS QUESTIONS — POLITICO’s Isaac Arnsdorf: “Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine said Sunday he's concerned about the proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner, suggesting a Hillary Clinton administration might be skeptical of the deal if she wins the election. ‘I share those concerns and questions. We've got to get to the bottom of them,’ the Virginia senator told host Chuck Todd on NBC's ‘Meet the Press.’ ‘Less concentration, I think, is generally helpful, especially in the media.’ “Clinton hasn't commented on the deal but has previously called for strong regulatory scrutiny of major mergers. … Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) said it ‘raises some immediate flags about consolidation in the media market.’ The $85.4 billion merger would increase consolidation in the telecom industry by combining AT&T’s phone and internet services with Time Warner’s media brands such HBO, CNN and Warner Bros.” Read more. SANDERS: HELL NO! — Bernie Sanders on Twitter: “The administration should kill the Time Warner/AT&T merger. This deal would mean higher prices and fewer choices for the American people” WHAT’S AT STAKE FOR WALL STREET — Bloomberg: “Wall Street banks are writing some of their biggest checks ever to fund AT&T Inc.’s takeover of Time Warner Inc. as they seek a bonanza of fees. But there’s a dose of concern that the $40 billion loan pledge may get caught up in a regulatory impasse. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has pledged $25 billion of the financing, with Bank of America Corp. providing the rest … That’s believed to be the most JPMorgan has ever promised for a deal … “The lending commitment gives the banks an advantage on bond offerings that would find willing buyers among yield-starved investors … At the same time the banks face the risk that the deal, along with a chunk of their balance sheets, would be tied up if regulators delay approving it.” Read more. GOLDMAN ON 2017 — Via Goldman’s “Weekly Kickstart” report: “Regardless of victor, we expect that the most likely economic policy outcomes of the US presidential election are increased fiscal spending and tax reform. … Our economists expect that Clinton’s tax plans will closely resemble those put forward by the Obama Administration in the FY 2017 budget, which proposed a one-time tax of 14 percent on previously untaxed foreign profits. “Mr. Trump has echoed the proposal by House Republican leaders, which also includes a repatriation tax holiday … Our recently rebalanced basket of 50 S&P 500 stocks with the highest earnings invested overseas … should benefit from an earnings repatriation holiday. Stocks in our High Overseas Earnings basket hold $1.7 trillion of permanently reinvested foreign earnings, equal to 70 percent of the $2.4 trillion held by all S&P 500 firms” HAPPENING TODAY: WEISS AT THE NYFRB — Via a Treasury official on Monday’s Treasury conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York: “Antonio Weiss is delivering one of a number of speeches and he plans to articulate a view on transparency in the Treasury market in the wake of the last week’s FINRA rule becoming final that will allow the official sector to start collecting Treasury cash market data in July.” Full agenda/webcast.

RYAN’S DAYS AS SPEAKER NUMBERED? — Stan Collender in Forbes: “Never mind the next Congress: It now looks like Ryan could be deposed or forced to resign this Congress in the lame duck session that begins a week after Election Day. In other words, Ryan may no longer be speaker about four weeks from now. “I say this after hearing from several highly reliable sources that the House Freedom Caucus is seriously considering doing to Ryan what it did to former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) by threatening him with a privileged motion to vacate the chair. If a majority of the House supported the motion, Ryan would be removed immediately as speaker.” Read more. TRUMP WIN COULD CRUSH MARKETS — POLITICO’s Ben White: ‘Wall Street is set up for a major crash if Donald Trump shocks the world on Election Day and wins the White House. New research out on Friday suggests that financial markets strongly prefer a Hillary Clinton presidency and could react with panicked selling should Trump defy the polls and deliver a shocking upset on Nov. 8. … “The new report suggests that the stock market is worth 11 percent more under a Clinton presidency than a Trump presidency. This is a highly unusual circumstance because markets historically prefer Republican policies on taxes, regulation and trade to those of Democrats. … Current market action is the direct reverse of what happened in 2012 when President Barack Obama was running for reelection against former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. When Romney clearly beat Obama in the first debate, markets rallied” Read more. GOOD MONDAY MORNING — Only 15 days to go!

CALL … FROM CITIGROUP — An eagle-eyed reader found this post from Trump on his Trump University web site: “It’s a familiar scenario to me, because one night at 3am, when I was more than $9 billion in debt, I was summoned to Citibank for a conference call with a bevy of international bankers to whom I owed money. “It was pouring rain and I couldn’t get a cab, so I had to walk to the bank, 15 blocks from Trump Tower.

Ask someone about the Sunday Night Football game between Arizona and Seattle that ended in a 6-6 tie in incredibly bizarre fashion. ‘TRUST’ US — FT’s Matthey Garrahan: “AT&T faces an uphill battle to convince US regulators that its proposed $85.4bn purchase of Time Warner will not unfairly distort the media and communications industries after opponents of the deal said the combined entity would wield too much market power. “The purchase faces at least a year of regulatory scrutiny. In a joint statement, senators Mike Lee and Amy Klobuchar, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, said the deal ‘would potentially raise significant antitrust issues, which the subcommittee would carefully examine’.” Read more. MASSIVE SKEPTICISM — NYT’s Michael J. de la Merced: “Reaction to AT&T’s $85.4 billion purchase was swift — and, outside of Wall Street, full of skepticism. Much of the concern was rooted in how consumers have fared since Comcast bought NBCUniversal, a deal that provided a template for the consolidation of media and telecommunications. … [C]ombining a telecommunications company with a media company, in particular, raises questions about whether consumers would have less choice because the conglomerate both creates its own content and provides the pipes” … “In a statement, the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust subcommittee said they planned to hold a hearing on the deal. And even competitors like Disney quickly chimed in, urging regulators to pay close attention in their review. At issue is whether AT&T, with over 100 million subscribers across its wireless, broadband and DirecTV offerings, will somehow favor its own customers when it comes to HBO, CNN and Warner Bros. properties like the Batman and Harry Potter franchises” Read more. A LONG AND UPHILL BATTLE — FT’s Matthew Garrahan: “The purchase faces at least a year of regulatory scrutiny. In a joint statement, senators Mike Lee and Amy Klobuchar, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, said the deal ‘would potentially raise significant antitrust issues, which the subcommittee would carefully examine’. “‘I think AT&T is going into this knowing they have an uphill battle,’ said Amanda Wait, an antitrust partner at Hunton & Williams, a Washington law firm. ‘Any Clinton administration will take a tough look at it. The key issues here will be whether owning Time Warner content harms competition or whether it makes AT&T stronger.’” Read more. HOW IT COULD SUCCEED — WP’s Brian Fung: “[T]he FCC's involvement hinges on whether Time Warner sells certain assets to AT&T. If the FCC is excluded from the process, it could weaken regulators' ability to prevent harm to competition, said Gene Kimmelman, a former Justice Department antitrust official who is now president of the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. … “The FCC generally has a say in acquisitions that involve the sale of assets regulated by the agency. This may include, for example, TV stations owned by one of the two companies. But in Saturday's deal involving AT&T and Time Warner, no such assets may change hands. Time Warner owns just one Atlanta-based TV station, and it has not announced whether the station will be sold to AT&T. The station could be spun off and excluded from the deal — which would also eliminate any reason for the FCC to become involved” Read more. GAME OVER — WSJ’S Robert McMillan and Rory Jones: “The computerized attack that left more than 1,200 websites unreachable on Friday stemmed from efforts, years earlier, by players of online games to frustrate and slow their opponents, security experts say. “Several security experts say the computer instructions for the attack had been refined from code written by disaffected videogame players calling themselves Lizard Squad who launched attacks on Christmas Day 2014 against online-game services operated by Sony Corp. and Microsoft Corp.” Read more.

JUST CAPITAL — POLITICO’s Colin Wilhelm: “A top banking regulator is likely to include capital requirements for startups if it offers them a national charter, a decision that could discourage companies from pursuing the charter that several of them have long sought. “Industry stakeholders, as well as regulators themselves, say that a limited-purpose fintech charter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency will probably include some kind of capital requirements similar to what a bank would face.” Read more. RUSSIA TO MEET WITH OPEC — Reuter’s Rania el Gamal and Reem Shamseddine: “Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Sunday he had invited his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak to meet Gulf Arab energy ministers in Riyadh as part of efforts to cooperate with non-OPEC members to stabilize the oil market. “Falih said Novak had welcomed the invitation, ‘as a clear indication of sincere desire to continue cooperation and coordination with the oil producing and exporting countries for more stability in the market.’” Read more. ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR — WHAT TRUMP MEANS FOR BANKS — American Ian McKendry: “Despite more than a year of campaigning and discussing various issues … Trump remains a huge question mark when it comes to banking policies — making it unclear exactly what his priorities would be if he succeeds in seizing the White House. … “During the campaign, he's vacillated between populist views like calling for the return of Glass-Steagall and more traditional conservative ones like favoring a reduction in regulation. It makes it hard to gauge his real agenda, observers said.” Read more. COULD OBAMA TEAM STICK AROUND? — Via POLITICO’s Lorraine Woellert: “Meet the new boss: Same as the old boss? Hillary’s coattails are looking short, making it increasingly likely she’ll have to deal with a divided — and cranky — Senate. “To preserve political capital, she might want to skip a few confirmation battles, and a growing school of thought in Washington says she’ll ask some Obama people to stick around. HUD Secretary Julian Castro might be one of them. Housing is shaping up to be a low policy priority and there’s no burning need to make a strong political statement.” FIRST LOOK: NEW GSE REPORT — American Action Forum’s Douglas Holtz-Eakin has a new piece on Monday on the CBO’s recent analysis on the recap and release bill for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: “The best course forward is real GSE reform.

Then early next year about 20 banks will put the Zelle name on their mobile apps and web pages. A Zelle app also will be offered to the public for connections through other institutions. The consortium is taking a series of steps in its attempt to bring more than 100 million customers of banks and credit unions into Zelle without disrupting people who already use other ways to send money with phones and computers. “This is about creating a wide, and inclusive, alternative to cash and checks for everyone,” said Finch, who was at the Money 20/20 payments industry conference in Las Vegas to promote Zelle for its bank owners. The moves come five years after three of the biggest banks -JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co – formed a joint-venture, initially called clearXchange, to make it easier to send money to accounts at different banks. But the banks were slow to bring other financial institutions into the fold and market the network and so lost momentum to technology company upstarts. Citigroup Inc did not agree to join until September. The banks only recently decided to use the name Zelle. In the meantime, Venmo appeared. In the three months through September, Venmo processed $4.9 billion of person-to-person payments, up 131 percent from a year earlier. Venmo, now part of PayPal Holdings Inc, built its following by social networking young adults ready to share dinner tabs and apartment rents with their phones. But the banks have larger bases of customers to connect as they try to make Zelle ubiquitous. JPMorgan’s Chase “Quick Pay,” for example, processed $7.4 billion in the three months ended September, up 36 percent from a year earlier, according to bank spokeswoman Rebecca Acevedo. The initial set of 19 banks to offer Zelle early next year has about 76 million customers using mobile banking apps and about 65 percent of U.S. checking and savings accounts, Finch said. Agreements in place with additional financial institutions, debit card networks and other payment companies, such as Fiserv Inc, will bring the portion of accounts to 90 percent to 95 percent, Finch said. The bank consortium owners decided that for Zelle to succeed it needs to look and work the same for everyone. But some banks already have made digital payment brand names, such as JPMorgan’s Quick Pay, familiar to many of their customers. Those banks will use the Zelle name prominently alongside their established names as Zelle catches on, Finch said.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Canara Bank x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ Canara Bank EXPAND TO VIEW ALL What keeps the chief executive of the world’s most valuable lender JPMorgan Chase Jamie Dimon awake at nights is not a blow up in trading books, regulatory nightmares or shrinking bond markets, but cyber crimes that are becoming as routine an affair as daily trading. The US bank spends nearly $600 million a year on cyber security. Pose the same question to Indian banks, the top ones, including State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank, are not even willing to engage in conversations over the topic. Canara Bank is the only bank which replied saying that they have budgeted Rs 520 crore for IT security for the current financial year. Unlike the banks in the West, Indian lenders still do not appear to be sensitised to the threat from the cyber world, and their reactions to the possible theft of details of 3.2 million account holders in the biggest ever security attack reflect either their lack of seriousness or hesitation in admitting to the threat fearing dent to their reputation. Monetarily the damage from cyber attacks so far has been very limited, but it has the potential to get bigger and disrupt the nation’s financial architecture and even result in the collapse of the system. Most of the crimes here have been aimed at disruption rather than to steal money on a large scale, unlike in cases like Bangladesh where $81 million was lost. “Cyber crime is an issue that can actually bring down companies, and, at this point, banks need a more strategic approach in dealing with this,” says Amit Jaju, executive director, fraud investigation and dispute services, Ernst & Young, India. “It’s important that they identify cyber crime as a key agenda for the board.” Information from 19 banks were compromised with an estimated financial loss of Rs 1.3 crore in a mission that lasted for as long as six weeks before the banks woke up to the crime. While the regulator mandates that banks report any breach immediately, banks are reluctant to do so fearing damage to their reputation. The malware, reportedly introduced into the systems of Hitachi Payment Services, was lying undetected for weeks before consumer complaints exposed the technology deficiency of the banks and that of the service provider. No banker wanted to speak on record on this issue. Mails sent to many banks went unanswered. Police authorities that ET spoke with say that banks need to be more proactive in raising a red flag in such cases. “Sometimes banks are responsive and sometimes they are not. I think banks need to be more proactive with these cases,” said a senior police officer with Mumbai’s cyber cell. “Banks don’t report such incidents to us as they feel it harms their reputation. When we ask for information from the banks, they usually pass on the CCTV footage of the affected ATM.” The recent spate of attacks that had happened on the banking system of Japan and Bangladesh had shown that India could have been the next target. In Japan, the hackers made away with around $13 million with credit card data stolen from a South African bank. A major card skimming act was also discovered in Bangladesh in February this year where media reports from the country pegged the affected numbers at six ATM booths and three banks. So, are we really facing a threat of such proportion? “To be able to track and detect such attacks beforehand, banks need their systems to be more intelligent to be able to do a diagnosis,” says Atul Singh, regional director- banking, telecom and transport at Gemalto, a digital security firm. “The bigger problem is this network of hackers and fraudsters is usually a global symposium and cards defrauded here have been found to be used in the US or China where they do not have a second factor of authentication.” It is not just the technology installed in banks that would help detect such frauds, but the conduct of staff and internal policies and practices that are more important. In case of Bangladesh, for instance, the employees of the central bank were lured to visit certain websites and the moment an employee would visit a certain site, the malware would get downloaded into the bank’s systems. “Eighty per cent of the threats are coming from internal sources rather than external sources,” says Manoj Kulkarni, managing director, Barclays Technology Centre, India. “The discussions that are happening internally is that how do we make our employees aware how to beef up internal securities. We are also figuring out the internal processes that how alarms are raised, how are they tracked and how they are dealt with.” Indian banks are not the only ones exposed to cyber attacks, even the most sophisticated of the networks like the global payments messaging system SWIFT are also being attacked. With the interconnected nature of the industry, the financially weak state-run banks’ ability to invest in technology is also being questioned. “Banks are already considering several cost reduction strategies to address cost pressures in managing non-performing assets and shrinking margins,” said consulting firm PwC in a report named RBI’s Circular on Cyber Security. “In the wake of this, cyber security investment will not occur very easily. Banks will need to take a risk-based approach while building advanced capabilities. However, they may not be able to avoid baseline investments.” Regulator plays the most important role though in the wake of the recent fraud attack, it has only passed a statement instructing banks to adhere to its guidelines and review existing cyber security arrangements. In a country where banks are not willing to share even the list of defaulters to protect their own interests, to come out openly and share technology failures seems a distant dream. The RBI has issued guidelines for cyber security and it more or less covers all of it. What’s most important is how victims respond to such incidents. In Europe, there is something called the Cyber Defence Alliance. This alliance ensures that there is information sharing among various banks because cyber security is an issue which is faced by all financial institutions. “Going forward, regulators need to continue focusing on enforcing policies and procedures and the top management of banks need to come together to battle cyber criminals,” says Jaju of Ernst & Young, India.

By Ben White and Andrew Hanna 10/25/16 08:00 AM EDT GENSLER NOT GETTING A GIG? — MM hears that a senior Democrat on Capitol Hill has been assuring bank lobbyists that former CFTC Chair (and ex-Goldman Sachs exec and current Hillary Clinton campaign aide) Gary Gensler will probably not be getting a top spot in a potential Clinton administration. Progressives who love Gensler are not exactly thrilled with this. They are looking for Gensler to get a top spot in the West Wing or Treasury. But word going around the Hill is that Gensler will only get a “second tier” position. THE JOCKEYING — One Hill denizen noted that while Obama came to Washington with very little in the way of baggage and sprawling networks, Clinton has so many that “her coming to power is like the Roman Legions coming home.” Story Continued Below NO REPATRIATION? — In a other sign of the Dem on Dem violence to come should Clinton win, former Senate aide Tyler Gellasch emails: “As banks and corporations keep handicapping a repatriation tax holiday, the unassailable evidence from the 2004 holiday is that it was a complete disaster. “I don't think rewarding corporations who have avoided billions of taxes at the expense of the rest of us is likely high on Progressives' wish list. For the more moderate folks, it would be a bit cynical for a new Democratic Senate majority and President to agree on something that polls more than 70 percent against them.” HRC/WARREN LOVE … FOR NOW — Haroon Khan of the Federal Resources Group emails: “Interesting remarks by Sec Clinton today while campaigning with Senator Warren in NH. I wonder if she will have the same feeling as President particularly once the nomination process gears up.” He was referring to this from Clinton: “Some of the best TV you can see is on C-Span when Elizabeth going after a bank executive or a regulator. She is refusing to let them off the hook and she is not just speaking for herself, she is speaking for every single American who is frustrated and fed up. I am so looking forward to working with her to rewrite the rules of our economy … ” MORE ON TRUMP/CLINTON PLANS — Via the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget: “According to our findings, neither candidate would significantly increase economic growth to the 3 percent, 4 percent, or 5 percent growth levels hinted. Clinton would likely quicken growth because of her immigration reform while Trump would likely slow growth for the same reason. … “[W]when immigration reform is accounted for, we expect Clinton's plan to increase average real Gross Domestic Product growth from about 2.0 percent per year to 2.3 percent, while Trump's plan could reduce it to as low as 1.7 percent. Importantly, these estimates do not account for the candidates' trade, regulatory, or energy plans, all of which could further impact economic growth” Read more. BAYH MET WITH BANK LOBBYISTS DURING BAILOUT VOTE — POLITICO’s John Bresnahan: “Former Indiana senator and longtime Banking Committee member Evan Bayh held a series of private meetings with financial service industry executives and lobbyists throughout 2008 — just as Wall Street was collapsing and big banks were seeking a bailout from Washington, according to a newly obtained schedule for the ex-lawmaker now running to reclaim his seat. One of the engagements — which included lunches, dinners and golf outings — happened the day of the Wall Street bailout vote. “On Oct. 1, 2008, when the Senate voted to approve the $700 billion rescue package, Bayh held a ‘Lunch with Supporters’ that included lobbyists for the financial services industry, his schedule shows. Other meetings with industry lobbyists and officials took place in the weeks and months up to and following the bailout vote” Read more. LOVE YOU TOO, JOHN! — Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta in an email to communications director Jennifer Palmieri in July of last year with the subject line “Being a crazy person”: “Just read Ben White's piece in Politico on the speech. It was a joke. I think we might need to go postal on the press.” See the email. Here's the story that got Podesta so steamed up. MORE FROM WIKILEAKS: THE COURTING OF BOB WOLF — This appears to be from an exchange between Podesta and Clinton about Robert Wolf, a Wall Street exec and close confidante to President Obama. Podesta: “I think you may be seeing him today and wanted to let you know where his head is at. I spent an hour with him on Tuesday. I saw him a few days earlier at David Brock's book party and had heard he was cranky so asked if I could come see him. He wasn't so much cranky as trying to figure out where, if anywhere, he fits in the campaign. He has a super close relationship with Obama … . “He's not expecting that, but hoping that he could have some direct relationship with you and that the campaign would seek his views on economic issues. He raises money, but hopes that he isn't just connected to the campaign only as a fundraiser and only through Dennis. … Most importantly, Biden is courting him hard … All these guys are kind of pains in the ass in their own ways, but I find Robert pretty nice, pretty easy, and pretty smart.” GOOD TUESDAY MORNING — Officially just two weeks from Election Day!

DRIVING THE DAY — Trump campaigns in Sanford and Tallahassee, Florida … Clinton campaigns in Coconut Creek, Florida … Case-Shiller Home Prices at 9:00 a.m. expected to rise 0.2 percent … Consumer Confidence at 10:00 a.m. expected to dip to 101.5 from 104.1. GET TO KNOW TRUMP TOWER — Bloomberg has a new graphic going up Tuesday letting people explore Trump Tower: “On one half of the screen readers can dive into the incredible story of the building and on the other half users can click through the center of Trump's universe — Trump Tower — and view the tower, and its (in)famous tenants, floor by floor” Check it out. FRIENDS NOW/FRENEMIES LATER — POLITICO’sAnnie Karni: “This could be the ending of a beautiful friendship. Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren, dressed in matching jewel-toned pantsuits, touted each other’s virtues Monday … The happy rally represented an evolution for the two all-stars of the Democratic party. Clinton and Warren entered the campaign season as wary competitors who had never forged a personal bond during their overlapping years in power in Washington, D.C. “But there’s tension on the horizon: If Clinton wins, Warren has promised to rattle the gates of a Clinton White House — as she did to President Barack Obama — pushing for progressive, anti-Wall Street crusaders to fill posts as top economic advisers and, most importantly to her of all, treasury secretary. Warren and her staffers have already been feeding to the Clinton campaign lists of individuals they would consider appropriate for those posts — and signaling in unsubtle terms those whose appointment they would fight to block” Read more. SCRUTINIZER IN CHIEF — NYT’s Amy Chozick and Matt Flegenheimer: “[L]iberal Democrats are already looking past Election Day — and relying on Ms. Warren to become the thorn in chief in Mrs. Clinton’s side, scrutinizing her appointments and agenda. Mrs. Clinton has vowed that if elected she will work across the aisle with congressional Republicans, but relations with liberals, including Ms. Warren of Massachusetts and Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sherrod Brown of Ohio, could prove quite contentious” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: Now delivering: Retirement security for life! We know saving for retirement can be difficult, but policymakers can help by supporting policies to encourage saving, make retirement plans more widely available, and facilitate access to lifetime income strategies. Let’s send Americans paychecks for life. Learn more at: http://irionline.org/agenda. ** WEISS ON TREASURY TRANSPARENCY — POLITICO’s Patrick Temple-West: “The public needs more information about the U.S. government debt being bought and sold, but precautions need to be taken to keep businesses from getting burned by too much sunlight, a U.S. Treasury Department official said … ‘Trading in our nation's debt should be transparent to the public,’ Antonio Weiss, counselor to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, said at a New York Federal Reserve conference … ‘All significant participants in the Treasury market should be subject to comprehensive oversight and trade-reporting requirements.’ “But Weiss said regulators' desire for more Treasury transparency should accommodate businesses' concerns about possible disruptions to the market. ‘Transparency is not all or nothing, and one size may not fit all segments of the Treasury market,’ Weiss said. ‘We have heard the concerns regarding potential risks of increased transparency and believe that design is key.’” Full speech. MET LIFE VS FSOC — Compass Point’s Isaac Boltansky: “[T]he U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard oral arguments in MetLife v. FSOC. Lawyers from both sides faced pointed, and relatively detailed, questions from Judges Millett (Clinton appointee), Randolph (H.W. Bush appointee), and Srinivasan (Clinton appointee). “While it is dangerous to read too deeply into questions from the bench, our sense is the oral arguments in MetLife v. FSOC broke very slightly in favor of the government. Judge Randolph's questioning regarding cost-benefit analyses suggested sympathy for MetLife’s arguments. Questions from Judges Millett and Srinivasan suggested conceptual support for the FSOC’s unique position in the regulatory ecosystem, but stopped short of signaling a wholehearted acceptance of the government's position” TRUMP DOESN’T GET TRADE — Consumer Technology President Gary Shapiro in U.S. News: “In reality, any decline in manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has virtually nothing to do with competition from abroad and everything to do with a massive increase in productivity through the use of technology. … “Trump has also made a habit of attacking technology companies, such as Apple, openly suggesting that as president, he would strong-arm the company to build all its products in the U.S. What Trump doesn't say — or, more than likely, doesn't know — is that such a draconian move would do little to create jobs in America and would only result in vastly increased prices for Apple products to U.S. consumers.” Read more. CITI LOSES GROUND — TheStreet’s Brad Keoun: “As the largest U.S. banks race to reinvent themselves amid an onslaught of new regulations, Citigroup is falling behind. ‘On a key measure of profitability, Citigroup lags behind the other five big U.S. banks — and is barely halfway toward its own goal. During the first nine months of this year, the New York-based lender's return on tangible equity was just 7.7 percent, well behind the 14 percent at Wells Fargo and 13 percent at JPMorgan Chase. Citigroup has set a long-term goal in the "mid-teens," while refusing to set a timeline.” Read more. TWITTER PLANS JOB CUTS — Bloomberg’s Sarah Frier: “Twitter Inc. is planning widespread job cuts, to be announced as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter. “The company may cut about 8 percent of the workforce, or about 300 people, the same percentage it did last year when co-founder Jack Dorsey took over as chief executive officer, the people said. Planning for the cuts is still fluid and the number could change, they added. The people asked not to be identified talking about private company plans.” Read more. WELLS ADS BLITZ — FT’s Alistair Grey: “Wells Fargo is launching a television advertising campaign as part of a push by the bank’s new chief executive Tim Sloan to rebuild a brand damaged by the scandal over faked accounts. “The commercials, scheduled to begin on Monday evening, stop short of apologising for the debacle but tell viewers that the bank is ‘making changes to make things right’.” Read more. OBAMACARE COSTS TO RISE — FT’s Barney Jopson: “Health insurance costs under Barack Obama’s healthcare reforms will jump by an average of 25 per cent next year as the president’s signature initiative — which was designed to bring down costs for consumers — is undermined by growing problems. “The US Department of Health and Human Services said premiums for the most popular plans would rise by an average of 25 per cent, although the change in cost for many consumers would be less dramatic because the figure does not take account of government subsidies.” Read more. PROGRESSIVES PLAY LONG GAME — InsideSources’ Carter Dougherty: “Far from hankering for a fight similar to the one that torpedoed the nomination of a senior Treasury Department official in 2014, Democratic lefties and their outside allies are eyeing a complex process that doesn’t over-emphasize the importance of any single nomination. “With Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, at the center of the fight, progressives are also guarding against Clinton keeping power in the hands of White House staff or other appointees not confirmed by the U.S. Senate. The emphasis, say people close to the effort, is on the overall profile of her administration.” Read more. FRANCE CLEARS CALAIS — NYT’s Maurico Lima and Adam Nossiter: “Hundreds of migrants, mostly young men from Africa or Afghanistan, lined up in the cold on Monday for buses to take them to temporary housing all over France, as the government set in motion a plan in the port of Calais to clear the sprawling migrant camp known as the Jungle once and for all. “The squalid camp, growing and festering for over a year, has become a symbol of Europe’s faltering efforts to handle its migration crisis. Before Monday’s operation, the camp’s population was 6,000 to 8,000.” Read more. CHINA CHECKS INTO HILTON — Reuters’ Ankit Ajmera: “Chinese aviation and shipping conglomerate HNA Group said on Monday it would buy about 25 percent of hotel operator and manager Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc from biggest shareholder Blackstone Group LP for $6.5 billion “The deal will allow the HNA Group to appoint two directors to Hilton's board, raising its size to 10.” Read more. ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR — FIRST LOOK: FISCAL CONFIDENCE AT 52 — Via release out Tuesday: “As Election Day approaches, the nation’s fiscal health remains a top concern for voters … The Fiscal Confidence Index, modeled after the Consumer Confidence Index, is 52 (100 is neutral), indicating the nation’s fiscal future remains a top issue on voters’ minds as they head to the voting booth.” Read more. BI LAUNCHES MARKET DATA SITE — WSJ’s Lukas Alpert: “Business Insider’s partnership with German media conglomerate Axel Springer SE is growing closer. The nearly decade-old business news site is leveraging its relationship with its new corporate parent to launch MarketsInsider.com, a globally-focused markets data and news operation. The new site, which launches Monday, will be powered by data coming from Finanzen.net, Axel Springer’s German finance portal that crunches numbers coming from 100 exchanges around the world” Read more. HOW WALL STREET FUNDS GOV RACES — Via International Business Times: “Wall Street is getting around the SEC pay to play rule and funneling huge money into gubernatorial races in states where Wall St firms make big money off pension funds” Read more. TD TO BUY SCOTTRADE — WSJ’s Michael Wursthorn: “One of the nation’s biggest discount brokerages is buying a smaller rival as a decline in stock trading and a relentless price war in commissions push stock sellers to seek new ways to make money. The $4 billion acquisition of Scottrade Financial ServicesInc. by TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. joins two of the biggest names in online brokerage, a business that boomed in the late 1990s as technology stocks soared and individuals flocked online to buy stocks on their own for a fraction of what traditional brokers had charged them” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: As traditional pensions have disappeared, American workers have become more responsible for saving and preparing for their retirements. With longer lifespans, this often means saving for a longer retirement. These challenges have made planning and saving for retirement more difficult. But what if all Americans could get paychecks for life? Policymakers can help make this possible by supporting policies that encourage saving, make workplace retirement plans more broadly available, and facilitate access to lifetime income strategies.

Bethania Palma Oct 24, 2016 Share - - Claim: The Clinton Foundation suddenly transferred $1.8 billion to a bank in Qatar. false Origin:On 16 October 2016, the conspiracy-mongering fake new sites WhatDoesItMean.com, posted a story reporting that Hillary Clinton (or the Clinton Foundation, depending on whether one read the headline or the first paragraph) suddenly transferred $1.8 billion to the Qatar Central Bank. The story, posted by a blogger who uses the nom de plume Sorcha Faal, claimed the transfer was exposed by a report circulating in the Kremlin: An intriguing Ministry of Finance (MoF) report circulating in the Kremlin today says that elite Western bankers were “stunned/bewildered” a few hours ago after the Bank For International Settlements (BIS) registered a $1.8 billion transfer from the Clinton Foundation (CF) to the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) through the “facilitation/abetment” of JP Morgan Chase & Company (JPM) — and for reasons yet to be firmly established. According to this report, the Bank for International Settlements is the world's oldest international financial organization and acts as a prime counterparty for central banks in their financial transactions; the Qatar Central Bank is the bank of that Gulf State nations government and their “bank of banks”; JP Morgan Chase & Company is the United States largest “megabank”; and the Clinton Foundation is an international criminal money laundering organization whose clients include the Russian mafia. The article linked to a number of news sites and blogs but conveniently failed to link to the alleged Kremlin report that would support its main claim. The lack of proof that such a financial transfer was made hasn't stopped other unscrupulous web sites, such MegynKelly.org (which despite using her name doesn't have anything to do with the Fox News journalist Megyn Kelly) and Liberty Alliance from posting the story as though it were a legitimate news item. RationalWiki describes Sorcha Faal's blog as an "eyesore" that is taken seriously only by its conspiracy theorist audience, and even then only marginally: Sorcha Faal is the alleged author of an ongoing series of "reports" published at WhatDoesItMean.com, whose work is of such quality that even other conspiracy nutters don't think much of it. Each report resembles a news story in its style but usually includes a sensational headline barely related to reality and quotes authoritative high-level Russian sources (such as the Russian Federal Security Service) to support its most outrageous claims. Except for the stuff attributed to unverifiable sources, the reports don't contain much original material. They are usually based on various news items from the mainstream media and/or whatever the clogosphere is currently hyperventilating about, with each item shoehorned into the conspiracy narrative the report is trying to establish. As we have noted in the past, Sorcha Faal is a notorious poster of false information, but the Internet being what it is, such information gets picked up and spread by unwary readers. Previous yarns created by Faal contain headlines such as "Russia Names Hillary Clinton as 'Murder Suspect' in Death of Top UFO Researchers."

The venture, replacing an existing system called clearXchange next year, will be accessible to more than 76 million mobile banking customers when it starts, according to a statement Sunday from Early Warning, the bank-owned entity handling the project. The move is part of a tech upgrade and branding push by traditional financial firms eager to dispel their industry's image as slow, after past decades in which transferring funds between institutions often took days. Silicon Valley upstarts have been pushing into their turf with virtually instant payment systems such as PayPal's Venmo in recent years, even as a growing number of banks began matching their speed. Read more: • Crain's publishes list of largest commercial banks, thrifts • Homegrown banks grab more market share • Why overbanked Chicago has even more banks “The CEOs of these banks got together and said 'It's time to make this real,'” Paul Finch, chief executive officer of bank-owned Early Warning, said in a telephone interview. 'SPEED, AGILITY' Zelle is short for gazelle, which Finch said “conveys speed and agility.” The system lets consumers send money to one another using an e-mail address or mobile phone number registered with their financial institution. Users will be able to arrange real-time transfers online or, beginning next year, through Zelle's consumer mobile app. U.S. households made more than $1.2 trillion in person-to-person payments in 2014, according to Aite Group. About one-fifth of that was processed by non-banks like PayPal or Square Inc., Aite's research shows. Other firms set to use Zelle include Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Bank of New York Mellon, U.S. Bancorp, Capital One Financial, PNC Financial Services Group and BB&T. In the meantime, Finch says, the venture aims to build out the network to make it easier for additional regional and community lenders to join.

One of the big winners should the AT&T-Time Warner deal get done would be Morgan Stanley. The blockbuster $85.4 billion proposed unification of the two communications heavyweights pushed the investment bank to the top of the standings this year for U.S.-targeted mergers and acquisitions activity, according to Thomson Reuters figures updated Monday. In the largest deal of 2016, AT&T will pay $85.4 billion to acquire the media giant, should it get past significant regulatory hurdles. The deal has a total value of $108.7 billion when it includes Time Warner's net debt. M&A had been lagging in the U.S. and globally but has gotten some juice lately. The AT&T-Time Warner deal pushes the U.S. total to $1.23 trillion, lagging 2015's total of $1.61 trillion at the same juncture. Morgan Stanley has been in on 101 deals this year totaling $408.4 billion, lifting it from second place to first in the so-called league standings, ahead of JPMorgan Chase, which actually has done more total deals at 137 but for a value of $399.9 billion. Morgan Stanley did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The lift in revenue did little to boost the bank's share price, which was down slightly and trailing a broader market rally Monday. Other banks involved in the deal were JPMorgan, which moved up from third to second; Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which solidified its hold on fourth place; Citigroup, which moved from seventh to fifth; and Perella Weinberg Partners, which leaped from 32nd to 14th. Perella Weinberg, Bank of America and JPMorgan advised AT&T, with Bank of America and JPMorgan also offering bridge financing, while Sullivan & Cromwell and Arnold & Porter provided legal advice. Allen & Co, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley acted as financial advisors to Time Warner, while Cravath, Swaine & Moore was its legal advisor. — Reuters contributed to this report.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Mo Money Mo Problems America’s Biggest Banks Unveil Their Venmo Killer Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Mo Money Mo Problems America’s Biggest Banks Unveil Their Venmo Killer It’s called Zelle. by Maya KosoffOctober 24, 2016 1:49 pm Email Facebook Twitter From Bloomberg/Getty Images. Four years after Venmo revolutionized the mobile-payments space by giving millennials an easy way to exchange small amounts of money, instantly—and three years after PayPal acquired Venmo owner Braintree for $800 million— America’s biggest banks are finally catching up. On Sunday night, financial risk management company Early Warning announced that it has partnered with 19 U.S. banks—including Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citi, Capital One, and JPMorgan—to offer Zelle, a money-transfer service designed to compete with Venmo, PayPal, and Square Cash. Zelle—named for the “speed and agility” of a gazelle, according to Early Warning C.E.O. Paul Finch—will let users send money to others online or using a mobile app, beginning early next year. Unlike Venmo, PayPal, and other money-transfer services, however, Zelle allows users to gain access to their funds immediately at no extra cost. (Square Cash, Square’s answer to Venmo, charges a fee for instant deposits, while Venmo doesn’t offer such a service, requiring users to wait 1-2 business days before mobile deposits turn up in their real-world accounts.) Early Warning says 76 million mobile-banking customers will be able to access Zelle, which replaces an earlier money-transfer service called clearXchange, founded five years earlier by JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo. Zelle will have to make a compelling argument to millennials to get them to switch over from other services. Venmo still reigns as the quintessential millennial transaction platform, and it is still growing quarter-over-quarter. In the first three months of 2016, Venmo’s payment volume grew 154 percent, to $3.2 billion. PayPal ended 2015 with 179 million active customer accounts, growing its user base by 6.6 million in the last quarter of 2015. Several banks already have had their own digital payments services, like JPMorgan’s QuickPay, or Citibank’s PopMoney, but none have caught on widely. While it is unclear whether the Zelle name will simply paper over these banks’ existing brands and UX, creating a uniform experience, or whether the Zelle platform will supersede them entirely, Early Warning’s Venmo killer has one major advantage. It may not have the built-in cool factor that Venmo has cultivated over the years, but Zelle will benefit by being the default service provided automatically by many of the country’s biggest banks. While Venmo is already in wide use, it remains to be seen how loyal users will be once Zelle can provide instant transfers—an obstacle that third-party payments services haven’t been able to overcome.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) may need to change its timeline for an exit from the business of settling trades of U.S. government securities, Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell said on Monday. Powell said JPMorgan had publicly recognized the importance of not disrupting financial markets when it leaves the business. "The timeline set for a gradual transition over the next two years should be sufficient to avoid significant dislocations," Powell said in prepared remarks for a conference in New York on the structure of the U.S. Treasury market. "However, if unexpected complications arise, that timeline may need to be adjusted," Powell said. Currently, JPMorgan and Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) are the only two companies that provide settlement services for U.S. government securities. "Any disruptions to these critical market services could have serious consequences for financial stability," Powell said, adding that the Bank of New York Mellon will continue to be held to higher standards of resilience given its systemic importance.

Ogg October 24, 2016 11:50 am EST Print Email Tweet Shares of Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ARIA) were down handily on Monday. The drop follows news that JPMorgan downgraded the stock to Underweight from Neutral. The firm also set a $7 price target. What investors will care about here is that Ariad is not a typical downgrade stock. On top of that, Ariad just came under scrutiny for a drug price hike after Senator Sanders asked the company about the pricing of its blood cancer drug Iclusig. What is so different here from other cases in which drug price hikes have come under scrutiny is that Ariad is not yet profitable. Its shares fell as much as 15% in the past week or so when the Sanders query was made and on word of repeated and staggering price hikes. Reportedly, Ariad has raised its wholesale price of Iclusig as a therapy for a rare advanced form of leukemia four times over the course of a year. Bloomberg showed that its 30-day pack now costs over $16,000, for a cost of almost $200,000 per year. Iclusig sales almost doubled to $65 million in the second quarter of this year. Another word of caution came from RBC Capital Markets, which noted that Ariad’s estimates may be 20% too high as a result of the congressional inquiry into Iclusig. The fear is that even if nothing comes out bad against the company, Ariad will still have to make some form of concession. Even before the formal JPMorgan downgrade on Monday, the firm warned just last week that the pricing scrutiny made for a scenario in which the firm would not be surprised by some continued profit taking in the near term. Again, what stands out here on Monday is that the drug price hikes are against a company that is not even profitable. As of the end of 2015, the company’s accumulated deficit for retained earnings was −$1.445 billion. That figure was down to −$1.389 billion by the end of June. Another issue worth noting is that for the past four years, again while the company has been losing money, research and development has been the single largest expense on average and is generally more than 50% of its expenses. Ariad shares were trading at $13.07 on October 13, but they were down to $11.14 on October 14. Its stock has drifted lower almost every trading day since. After shares were down 3.7% to $10.38 on Friday, Monday’s initial trading was indicated down almost 4% at $9.97, but its shares were last seen down 7.5% at $9.60. While this stock is down 30% or so in the past month, share are still up about 50% so far in 2016. Ariad now has a consensus analyst price target of $13.33, according to Thomson Reuters. That is down from $10.43 just a month ago. Stay tuned. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Jon C.

Wall Street banks are writing some of their biggest checks ever to fund AT&T’s takeover of Time Warner as they seek a bonanza of fees. But there’s a dose of concern that the $40 billion loan pledge may get caught up in a regulatory impasse. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has pledged $25 billion of the financing, with Bank of America Corp. providing the rest, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified without authorization to speak publicly. That’s believed to be the most JPMorgan has ever promised for a deal, the person said. The lending commitment alone would bring about $110 million to $130 million in fees for JPMorgan and Bank of America, according to estimates from consulting firm Freeman & Co. It also gives the banks an advantage on bond offerings that would find eager buyers among yield-starved investors. At the same time, the banks face the risk that the deal, along with a chunk of their balance sheets, would be tied up if regulators delay approving it. “This could be an especially lucrative deal for the banking industry; they’re going to make a lot of money if the deal gets done” said Bert Ely, a banking consultant at Ely & Co. “The numbers on the credit piece look big, but I’m sure the credit risk will be spread widely. The big uncertainty hanging over this will be the battle for regulatory approval and what lender protections are included if the deal fails.” T-Mobile failure A failed megadeal wouldn’t be the first for AT&T. In 2011, the company abandoned its takeover of T-Mobile USA because of regulatory hurdles. JPMorgan had lined up $20 billion to finance that deal. Taking on commitments to underwrite large deals helps JPMorgan maintain its top position in leading corporate debt deals in the U.S. JPMorgan has occupied the top spot for managing dollar bond sales from highly rated companies since 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank has been the top provider of similarly rated loans for each year since 2005, Bloomberg data show. To help finance this proposed deal, AT&T brought in Bank of America as its partner on Thursday, keeping the number of participants to a minimum until the announcement, the person said. JPMorgan intends in the coming weeks to syndicate most of the $40 billion loan to other banks that already lend to AT&T. Bridge loan The loan is structured as an 18-month bridge deal, a type of financing that a borrower repays by issuing debt in capital markets. In the case of AT&T, most of the deal will be replaced by high-grade bonds, with a potential portion in the form of term loans, the person said. AT&T said that it’s seeking to hang onto its investment-grade credit rating after the deal is completed. But the lenders themselves are taking on other risks by using their balance sheet resources, according to Charles Peabody, a bank analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading.  “That is dangerous because this deal could be hung up in antitrust wranglings for a long time,’’ he said. JPMorgan and Bank of America won’t be protected if credit markets swing and they can’t sell the debt for what they had anticipated, he said.  Jessica Francisco, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, and Thomas Rottcher, a Bank of America spokesman, declined to comment. AT&T, based in Dallas, didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail and calls on Sunday. The deal caps AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson’s vision to expand the company into media and entertainment as its wireless business matures. Gaining premium cable channels HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros. studio means AT&T becomes a content owner rather than just a distributor of video. Yield hunger For the investors that would later be asked to buy bonds refinancing the bridge loan, the takeover means a juicy alternative to the more than $10 trillion of debt globally that’s yielding less than zero, driven down by easy-money policies from Europe to Japan. “The investor base is starved for yield,” said David Hendler, founder of Viola Risk Advisors and a veteran bank analyst. “This would be a good earning asset in a low yield world—which is very much in demand at the moment in the syndicate market. Banks are deposit-rich and looking to invest in loans.” The prospective deal has raised regulatory questions ahead of the U.S. election, as both the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees expressed suspicion of blockbuster deals. Hillary Clinton has been critical of big mergers and has called for “reinvigorating” antitrust enforcement while her opponent Donald Trump broke with Republican orthodoxy on Saturday by saying he would block the Time Warner acquisition, arguing that such deals leave too much power concentrated among too few companies. If AT&T’s deal doesn’t gain approval, it must pay a $500 million reverse break-up fee to Time Warner, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Bond trading Beyond collecting the fees that come from underwriting large takeovers, banks also benefit from trading that debt in the secondary market. CEO Brian Moynihan pointed to Bank of America’s debt underwriting business as a reason for his beat last week in estimates for third-quarter fixed-income trading revenue.  Wall Street’s biggest investment banks have been taking a greater percentage of their overall revenue from issuing new debt and trading fixed-income products, which includes corporate debt, sovereign debt, currencies and commodities. Debt underwriting made up 11.3% of U.S. investment banks’ third-quarter revenue, about a percentage point more than in the same period two years ago, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. U.S. banks relied on fixed-income underwriting and trading to propel 56 percent of their total investment banking business in the third quarter, a rise from 47% last year and 50% two years ago, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. “These guys are fairly anxious to generate fee income. This is an area where you can make money very quickly. And very big money,’’ said Compass Point’s Peabody.  Bank of America Corp.BankingWall StreetTechnologyFinanceInvestment Get Crain's Digital NY Alert Sign up for our FREE weekly Digital NY email newsletter.

He added, however, that the shares now reflect more than a healthy 2018, while underestimating the risks. Analyst Wertheimer downgraded the Machinery sector from Neutral to Negative, saying that valuation reflected “a relatively sharp rebound back to midcycle and trades even with multi industry in 2018…But cycle overhangs are larger than normal in every way.” Terex Wertheimer downgraded the rating on Terex Corporation (NYSE: TEX) from Equal-weight to Underweight, while maintaining the price target at $20. The new management team has been several positive changes in less than a year. The company’s balance sheet is now stronger, backed by asset sales. “What remains is a strategically well positioned Aerial Work Platform business, a cranes business that is struggling but which to be fair is now deeply cyclically depressed, and a very steady materials processing business of middling attractiveness.” The analyst noted, however, that the replacement cycle would likely be stepper and harder than is currently being anticipated. Actuant Wertheimer downgraded the rating on Actuant Corporation (NYSE: ATU) from Equal-weight to Underweight, while maintaining the price target at $19. Actuant has a dynamic new CEO, some high quality businesses and a few “straightforward paths to value creation.” Despite these positives, the challenges ahead for the company would likely be greater than the market is currently estimating, the analyst commented. WABCO Wertheimer upgraded the rating on WABCO Holdings Inc. (NYSE: WBC) from Equal-weight to Overweight, while maintaining the price target at $107. While the US downturn does not seem to have bottomed out, Europe would likely move downward for the next three to five years. The analyst added, “Wabco is, however, a high quality company with a clear and successful strategy, a path to outgrow tepid market growth across industrials, has a no-debt balance sheet, and trades under 16x our 2018 estimate.” Wertheimer believes that even in the absence of a supportive end market, Wabco’s growth would result in the stock being among the cheaper names in the group in a couple of years. Estimates already reflect weakness in the US and an EU downturn. While saying that there is potential for upside to growth, the analyst pointed out that Wabco’s balance sheet supports the possibility of acquisition, while other machinery companies have been repurchasing shares in recent years.

America's biggest banks are closing hundreds of branches Business Insider 10/24/2016 Tina Wadhwa © Provided by Business Insider   America's biggest banks are closing hundreds of branches. Quotes in the article Bank of America Corporation BAC ▲ 20.16 +0.08 +0.40% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 79.36 -0.15 -0.19% Citigroup Inc C ▲ 55.45 +0.77 +1.41% Wells Fargo & Co WFC ▼ 52.59 -0.63 -1.18% Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan shut 389 branches since the third quarter of last year.  Bank of America, which had over 6,000 branches before the financial crisis has now shrank to 4,629, according to third quarter accounts.  The bank has cut 112 financial centers from last year.  Paul Donofrio, CFO of Bank of America, said the closing of branches was part of a "shift to self-served digital channels, mobile, online, and ATM" in a 3Q earnings call transcript.  According to the 3Q earnings report, the bank has 21 million mobile banking active users and 18% of deposit transactions are completed through mobile devices. "That’s better for customers, it’s also better for our shareholders," said Donofrio. "It’s one-tenth the cost of walking into a branch." "So it’s a quality versus quantity and making sure we understand," said CEO Brian Monihyan on the earnings call. "I’d say we went from seven million visits probably four to five years ago to six to five. But those five are of a higher quality, and we think that’s important." There are less bank branches, but the ones that stand reflect changing customers' behaviors. As consumers opt to go online for transactional services like check deposits, bank branches now emphasize  more value added services that " you just have to do face to face" and are adding more mortgage and investment specialists.  They are becoming a place to come for advice according to life events - mortgages, investments, saving for college.  And the cuts aren't just in terms of bank branches but also in headcount. Bank of America indicated back in June that it planned to cut over 8,000 jobs from its consumer banking division. According to retail banking head and consumer banking co-head Thong Nguyen at a June conference, this is part of a broader cost-cutting and resource reallocation program to meet with consumers' changing banking habits. Bank of America isn't the only bank to restructure its branches. When Citigroup announced its third-quarter earnings last Friday, October 14, it revealed its branch count has shrunk 7% in North America from the third quarter of last year and is down 116 banks globally to 2,679. "We have spent the last several years reshaping our branch network, upgrading technology and deepening our focus on our core six markets, enabling us to grow revenues while reducing expenses and significantly improving the profitability of our retail bank," Citigroup CFO John Gerspach said on the 3Q earnings call. Earlier this year, Citi Global Perspectives and Solutions (GPS) produced a report that found that banks are quickly approaching their "automation tipping point," and they could soon reduce headcount by as much as 30%. "Banks' Uber moment will mean a disintermediation of bank branches rather than the banks themselves," the report said. "Specifically, it will mean the shift to mobile distribution being the main channel of interaction between customers and the bank," the report reads. © Provided by Business Insider   That means that there will be less need for bank branches, and the people who work inside them. JPMorgan has also been cutting back on the number of retail branches, with 161 less branches this quarter than the third quarter of last year. 3Q 2016 stores stand at 5,310, down from 5,471 in the same quarter last year.  According to JPMorgan CFO  Marianne Lake on the 3Q earnings call, new card account originations were up 35% this quarter, with more than three quarters of new accounts being opened through digital channels, and active mobile users were up 17% in 3Q.  JPMorgan is also focusing marketing efforts to millennial customers, who now compromise 57% of new checking account customers and are more likely to use mobile banking.  Major retail bank Wells Fargo historically hasn't cut branches as much as its peers and hasn't announced any major closures in light of its huge fraudulant account scandal. However, credit card applications, consumer loyalty and interactions between branch bankers and customers have declined sharply according to its 3Q earnings report last Friday, October 14. In the 3Q quarterly earnings report, the bank indicated a renewed shift to mobile, which they said "will allow us to review our branch footprint for consolidation opportunities." © Provided by Business Insider   Whether Wells Fargo realizes it or not, they're going to be closing 1,000 branches," CLSA bank analyst Mike Mayo told CNN Money. "It's a matter of when, not if." While traditional retail banks shift their focus to digital models, others not in the consumer space, like Goldman Sachs, are launching online only US savings account. Online only GS Bank launched this past April and Goldman's new consumer lending arm, Marcus, launched earlier this month.  "Digital technology is making large brick and mortar branches questionable," said Harit Talwar, head of Digital Finance at Goldman Sachs, in a podcast. "You don't need necessarily brick and mortar branch networks to get into consumer financial services. Why wait in line when I can do it in on the phone? The traditional distribution strengths that some of the large banks have, from distribution strengths have become legacy costs."

PHOTO: REUTERS Oct 24, 2016 12:40 PM [NEW YORK] By the end of December some US bank customers may begin to notice features of the new Zelle instant payments network appearing on their mobile phone and online banking apps as the financial industry tries to catch up to technology company rivals, such as Venmo. Paul Finch, chief executive of the bank network operator, Early Warning Services, said during the weekend that buttons on user screens for digital payments at some banks will gradually start to use a uniform procedure for individuals to send and receive money. Then early next year about 20 banks will put the Zelle name on their mobile apps and web pages. A Zelle app also will be offered to the public for connections through other institutions. The consortium is taking a series of steps in its attempt to bring more than 100 million customers of banks and credit unions into Zelle without disrupting people who already use other ways to send money with phones and computers. "This is about creating a wide, and inclusive, alternative to cash and checks for everyone," said Mr Finch, who was at the Money 20/20 payments industry conference in Las Vegas to promote Zelle for its bank owners. The moves come five years after three of the biggest banks -JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co - formed a joint-venture, initially called clearXchange, to make it easier to send money to accounts at different banks. But the banks were slow to bring other financial institutions into the fold and market the network and so lost momentum to technology company upstarts. Citigroup Inc did not agree to join until September. The banks only recently decided to use the name Zelle. In the meantime, Venmo appeared. In the three months through September, Venmo processed US$4.9 billion of person-to-person payments, up 131 per cent from a year earlier. Venmo, now part of PayPal Holdings Inc, built its following by social networking young adults ready to share dinner tabs and apartment rents with their phones. But the banks have larger bases of customers to connect as they try to make Zelle ubiquitous. JPMorgan's Chase "Quick Pay,"for example, processed US$7.4 billion in the three months ended September, up 36 per cent from a year earlier, according to bank spokeswoman Rebecca Acevedo. The initial set of 19 banks to offer Zelle early next year has about 76 million customers using mobile banking apps and about 65 per cent of US checking and savings accounts, Mr Finch said. Agreements in place with additional financial institutions, debit card networks and other payment companies, such as Fiserv Inc, will bring the portion of accounts to 90 per cent to 95 per cent, Mr Finch said. The bank consortium owners decided that for Zelle to succeed it needs to look and work the same for everyone. But some banks already have made digital payment brand names, such as JPMorgan's Quick Pay, familiar to many of their customers. Those banks will use the Zelle name prominently alongside their established names as Zelle catches on, Mr Finch said.

Three people familiar with the case say the government has been investigating at least a dozen Venezuelans and is expected to file charges in Houston against a few of them as soon as next month. Those on the list, including former executives of Petroleos de Venezuela, known as PDVSA, are suspected of having taken bribes from middlemen to award contracts at inflated prices, helping to siphon more than $11 billion out of the country. All three people spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing and sensitive due to its impact on U.S. foreign policy. The government has set its sights on a number of U.S. assets, including about 20 residential properties, some in West Palm Beach and the Houston suburbs. Venezuela’s opposition-run Congress is separately seeking to recover $11.3 billion that went missing from PDVSA between 2004 and 2014 while Rafael Ramirez, currently Venezuela’s ambassador to the United Nations, was company president. It seeks to hold him politically responsible. Ramirez has rejected the congressional accusations as lies. Investigators are also looking at the dealings involving PDVSA and a number of companies, including Pratt & Whitney, General Electric and Rolls Royce Holdings, as well as ProEnergy Services, a Missouri-based firm, two of the people said. The prosecutors have been tracking money that flowed through Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, they added. A Pratt & Whitney spokesperson declined to comment and noted that its power systems business, which operated in Venezuela, was divested in June 2013 and became PW Power Systems. PW Power Systems did not respond to requests for comment. The other three companies declined to comment, as did all three banks and PDVSA. The banks handled transactions through accounts held by the individuals who transferred some of their gains out of the country, two of the people said. Money-laundering controls may not have caught transactions done through shell companies, they said. The people under investigation include current Venezuelan government officials, prominent businessmen and individuals suspected of involvement with cocaine trafficking, two of the people said. Homeland Security Investigations, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI are all involved in the investigation, which has been under way for at least three years and looks at activity going back to 2005. The FBI declined comment, as did the DEA, the Justice Department, Homeland Security Investigations and the U.S. Attorney’s office in Houston. The investigation comes at a time when the cost of corruption is vividly apparent in Venezuela’s crumbling economy. A former finance minister, Jorge Giordani, has said that as much as $300 billion was embezzled from Venezuela in the last decade through high-level corruption. Meanwhile, hunger is spreading in a country that was once one of the world’s wealthiest. Struggling to avoid default, PDVSA on Monday reached an agreement with some creditors to push back bond maturities. In response to the national crisis, the opposition has sought a voter signature drive aimed at recalling President Nicolas Maduro. Last week the National Electoral Council, which is run by Maduro loyalists, suspended that effort. On Sunday, the opposition accused the president of carrying out a coup and vowed to try to replace key figures on the Supreme Court and electoral council and appeal to the International Criminal Court. The U.S. has a strong legal interest in the case because the allegedly ill-gotten money passed through its banks and was used to buy property here. The people under investigation have been linked to billions of dollars of gains, much of which was transferred to offshore accounts in Panama, the people said. The U.S. would seize homes and properties — many of them worth tens of millions each — as well as private jets and other assets to create a fund that would eventually be returned to the Venezuelan government after a democratic election, one of the people said. Ricardo Hausmann, a Venezuelan economist at Harvard who would like to see the current government replaced, said U.S. leadership in this area could prove important. “If the U.S. were to say, ‘We’ve identified billions of dollars,’ it would have a devastating political effect at home with Venezuela’s current government,” he said. Washington would also earn goodwill if it later returned any stolen funds, he added. Javier Corrales, a political scientist at Amherst College, said that in dealing with Venezuela the U.S. has made a point of sanctioning individuals rather than the government as a whole. Some within law enforcement have nonetheless alleged that the Obama administration is dragging its feet in pursuing Venezuelan officials because of its desire to avoid a political and economic implosion there and to help negotiate a soft landing from the current crisis. Corrales said that while political interference may play a role in the sealing of some indictments, the U.S. government largely lets its justice system do its work. PDVSA’s U.S. affiliate that handles international purchasing is in Houston, where the U.S. recently prosecuted a case which investigators say resembles this one. Roberto Rincon-Fernandez, a Venezuelan national living there, took part in a $1 billion bribery scheme to secure contracts with PDVSA. He pleaded guilty to two counts, including conspiracy to violate corruption laws. Ever since the leftist party of Hugo Chavez was elected in 1998, Venezuela has allied itself with historic opponents of the U.S., including Cuba and Iran. The U.S. accuses Venezuela of allowing itself to be used as a route for illegal drugs and of failing to adhere to international counter-narcotics agreements. Two nephews of President Maduro arrested in Haiti are being held in the U.S. on charges that they were involved in a drug-trafficking ring. They have denied it. A State Department official said they are cooperating with federal investigators.

Morgan Asset Management says quotas are not the long-term solution to achieving a balanced workplace</p> Mary Callahan Erdoes: Quotas are not solution to diversity in workplace    Tuesday, 25 Oct 2016 | 6:00 AM ET | 01:30 SHARES Women are still underrepresented in the corporate boardroom, and they only hold a scant 4 percent of CEO positions in Fortune 500 companies. According to JPMorgan Asset Management CEO Mary Callahan Erdoes, though, quotas are not the way to achieve a more balanced gender ratio. Setting legal quotas is a strategy that several European countries, including Germany and Norway, are using to get more women in the boardroom. It's also a strategy that Erdoes "fundamentally disagrees with," she tells CNBC. David A. Grogan | CNBC Mary Callahan Erdoes "I think any minority that gets to a position of power or gets added to a board because of a quota doesn't want to be there," Erdoes says. "You don't want to be there because of a quota. You want to be there because you earned the right to get there." She isn't the only one put off by the idea of gender quotas. As The Washington Post reports, many American businesswomen believe that quotas could lead to women being perceived as "token" board members, rather than having attained the position solely by merit. That being said, "quotas are often an important way to get something jump-started … to get people to realize that there is an issue at hand," Erdoes notes. "Maybe for short periods of time it's a good thing to have, but it is not the long-term answer to the problem."

Newsletter FAQ | Cancel Any Time | We Value Your Privacy Wall Street Daily Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us Home Innovation GeoMacro Special Situations Contributors Free Reports Archives About Us WSD Team Contact Us Archives Ensure Email Delivery Frequently Asked Questions Broker Listing Presidential Election: Who Benefits Most From the “Establishment’s” Status Quo? Published Tue, Oct 25, 2016  |  David Dittman, Editorial Director We’re two weeks out from yet another federal election. Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose: The more it changes, the more it’s the same thing. The U.S. government knows who you are. And it probably would have little trouble tracking you down, because there’s a pretty strong likelihood that it has a searchable image of you. That’s the chilling conclusion of a report from the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy & Technology released October 18, 2016. “The result of a year-long investigation and over 100 records requests to police departments around the country,” reads The Perpetual Line-Up: Unregulated Police Face Recognition in America “is the most comprehensive survey to date of law enforcement face recognition and the risks that it poses to privacy, civil liberties, and civil rights. “Combining FBI data with new information we obtained about state and local systems, we find that law enforcement face recognition affects over 117 million American adults. It’s also unregulated.” And who’s to blame for that? Two weeks from today, we’ll go to the polls (well, maybe as much as 40% of our total population of 324 million, if we’re lucky) to elect a new president, 34 senators, and 435 members of the House of Representatives. There are countless state and local races and issues on ballots across the country, as well. But come the end of voting on November 8, not much is likely to have changed. It’s tempting to say that Donald Trump, a charismatic figure around whom discontented Americans have rallied over the past 15 months, and Bernie Sanders, who embodied the leftist form of this widespread disaffection but was thwarted by a well-oiled machine, landed some blows against the empire. Still, the machine seems likely to prevail two weeks from today. The Washington Consensus runs on national security and neoliberalism. And we let it. We succumbed to fear in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and we cling to consumerism as the primary ideology of our everyday life. The big winner – perhaps the only winner – is Corporate America. Even the idea shops are for sale. Gawker writes that a joint New York Times-New England Center for Investigative Reporting investigation published on August 8, 2016, found that “several major think tanks, while they profess to be purely research-driven organizations eager to assist in America’s robust policy debates, court companies for charitable donations in exchanges for pushing their corporate agendas.” As the NYT reported: Thousands of pages of internal memos and confidential correspondence between Brookings and other donors – like JPMorgan Chase, the nation’s largest bank; K.K.R., the global investment firm; Microsoft, the software giant; and Hitachi, the Japanese conglomerate – show that financial support often came with assurances from Brookings that it would provide “donation benefits,” including setting up events featuring corporate executives with government officials, according to documents obtained by The New York Times and the New England Center for Investigative Reporting. Similar arrangements exist at many think tanks. On issues as varied as military sales to foreign countries, international trade, highway management systems and real estate development, think tanks have frequently become vehicles for corporate influence and branding campaigns. These are not new problems. Indeed, 180 years ago, in a May 27, 1836, speech, Senator John C. Calhoun, noted, “A power has risen up in the government greater than the people themselves, consisting of many and various and powerful interests… and held together by the cohesive power of the vast surplus in the banks.” Calhoun was perhaps the most eloquent defender of the concept of states’ rights in the Ante-bellum period. He also spoke forcefully on the dangers of the tyranny of the majority, though, ironically, he also defended Southern traditions, including slavery, and was the ideological godfather of that group of radicals known as “fire-eaters.” So it’s easy to dismiss Calhoun and his ideas with the benefit of “presentism.” Let’s not, however, mince words: Slavery was a moral wrong, a violation of natural law from the jump. But Calhoun’s influence on U.S. public policy and political thinking can’t be dismissed, particularly when it comes to understanding the agglomeration of power. Another slaveholding Southerner, Thomas Jefferson, is now a legendary champion of agrarian democracy, widely credited with saying, “That government is best which governs least.” But it was actually Henry David Thoreau, reflecting on slavery, the Mexican-American War, and U.S. imperialism, who first turned the phrase to open his famous pamphlet On the Duty of Civil Disobedience. Thoreau also had in mind the stultifying impact of industrialization and proliferating market ideology on liberty of conscience. That it’s not really a Jeffersonian maxim – and so not expressly part of the Founders’ thinking – is important. Context is critical. Thoreau was reacting to slavery and the expansion of U.S. territory via war to expand indentured servitude. Liberty of conscience more than economic liberty was on his mind. Thoreau lived during a period of rapid economic growth, at the tail end of the Industrial Revolution. He was concerned by free enterprise and its capacity to reduce man to mere producers, buyers, and sellers. In Walden, he pondered the “seemingly wealthy, but most terribly impoverished class of all, who have accumulated dross, but know not how to use it, or get rid of it, and thus have forged their own golden or silver fetters.” And he warned, “But lo! Men have become the tools of their tools.” And those tools were functions of slavery and war. We’ve done away with the latter. The former, however, is still a primary organizing principle for society and government. At the conclusion of Backfire: How to Destroy a Presidential Candidate, a documentary short produced by Nate Silver’s data journalism outfit FiveThirtyEight.com, the veteran political reporter Sam Donaldson sums up the American-style struggle for power: The way to look at politics today – unfortunately – is not the way that purists would have it. It’s not the way young people want it. It’s the way it is. And the way it is is tough. Unyielding. Almost anything works. If it works, never mind if it’s ethical. Never mind whether it’s fair. Never mind whether it’s factual. If it works, for you, do it. To the power elite that run our empire, the ends justify the means. The good news is people are starting to wake up to their distorted reality. This Week In… Anger, which, as FT Alphaville’s David Keohane explains, is a phenomenon driving voters not just in the U.S. presidential election but in electoral contests all over the developed world: “It’s a bigly trend with enormous consequences for fiscal and monetary policy. But the rise of voter rage in advanced democracies is a hard narrative to chart, what with the lack of data and the abundance of anecdote.” Keohane shares a set of charts and tables compiled by Marvin Barth of Barclays Plc, who defines “voter rage as a drop in the combined vote share of the center-right and center-left parties as voters shift to parties that they believe better reflect their frustrations.” The bottom line is the “biggest source of voter rage appears to be a sense of economic and political disenfranchisement.” Smart Investing, David Dittman Editorial Director, Wall Street Daily Editorial Director David Dittman is an investment newsletter professional with more than 10 years' experience at staff, management, and strategic levels.

The list contains names of a hundred of CEOs, directors, managers, chiefs, etc. in a ranked way. The first one on the list is Gigi Chao from Hong Kong, but we can find the leaders of Airbnb, Lloyd’ of London, and JPMorgan in the top 10 as well. Péter Árvai is a CEO and co-founder of Prezi. Peter’s goal from day 1 was to create an open environment where everyone would be comfortable with sharing their identity with others and to celebrate diversity. This philosophy ended up seeing Prezi as the first Hungarian company to participate at the Budapest Pride in 2010 with their logo and branded t-shirts. And co-founding with Google and espell, the NGO We Are Open to promote openness at the workplace. This initiative is supported by more than 900 companies, communities and NGO’s within Hungary and regarded as a role model program by many companies throughout Europe.

This panel will focus on the settlement infrastructure for U.S. government securities-a vital component of the Treasury market and one that is undergoing an important transition. This segment of the industry has been in a period of slow but steady consolidation for several decades now. Thirty years ago, there were six banks providing a full suite of settlement services for U.S. government securities. Due to mergers and exits, two firms, Bank of New York Mellon (BNYM) and J.P. Morgan Chase (JPMC), have been the two dominant providers of these services since the 1990s. And soon there will be just one, given JPMC's planned exit. Given the importance of these services, the official sector has had a long involvement as the market structure has evolved. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Federal Reserve convened the private-sector Working Group on Government Securities Clearance and Settlement to recommend steps to mitigate risks to the financial system from a disruption to these services. That work led to the "NewBank" proposal.1 Although the proposal was ultimately put aside, NewBank would have been a dormant financial institution that could spring into action in the event of potential disruptions from an exit from this business by either of the clearing banks. Some of today's panelists were actively involved in that work. Of course, at that time, the business was roughly evenly split between the two providers. Today's situation is very different-BNYM now has over 80 percent market share, due mainly to consolidation among end users. The Federal Reserve has been working closely with the Department of the Treasury to ensure a smooth transition as JPMC prepares to exit. JPMC has said that it recognizes the need for, and its own interest in, ensuring that its exit does not disrupt the market. Indeed, JPMC will itself need to rely on these services going forward. The timeline set for a gradual transition over the next two years should be sufficient to avoid significant dislocations; however, if unexpected complications arise, that timeline may need to be adjusted. In the near term, this exit will leave BNYM as the sole provider of U.S. government securities settlement and triparty repo services for broker-dealers. We have been working intensively with BNYM in anticipation of this transition. We have long recognized that any disruptions to these critical market services could have serious consequences for financial stability, and have calibrated our supervisory expectations accordingly. To ensure financial stability, we expect the provision of U.S. government securities settlement services to be robust in nearly all contingencies. As BNYM becomes the sole provider, we will raise our expectations even higher. The bank has anticipated and welcomed this higher bar. BNYM is one of 8 U.S.-based systemically important banks. The bank is therefore subject to heightened capital and liquidity requirements and a resolution process that explicitly requires planning to ensure the continuity of critical services even in the event of a default. BNYM is unique in that it also plays the dominant-and soon the sole-role in government securities settlement and in the triparty repo market. These activities are comparable in their importance to those of the financial market utilities that have been designated as systemically important by the FSOC. Thus, BNYM will continue to be held to the high standards to which all U.S. bank SIFIs are held. And it will also be expected to operate in a manner that provides confidence that it is as resilient and robust as a systemically important financial market utility (FMU). Such FMUs are, of course, held to the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs).2 The PFMIs overlap with our banking regulation in many areas; for example, both emphasize the need for sound risk management and the importance of resilience and recovery. The PFMIs also emphasize a strong governance role in support of financial stability and the interests of market functioning, and this has been a focus of our work with Bank of New York Mellon regarding the transition. Although our current task is to establish appropriate expectations for Bank of New York Mellon as a sole operator, that focus should not be taken as an indication that the Federal Reserve or other public authorities have pre-judged what the longer-term landscape for government securities settlement should look like. In fact, we do not have a specific market design end state in mind. Rather, we recognize the systemic importance of these activities and the need to ensure their continued availability in nearly all states of the world, regardless of the firms that offer them or the specific market structure. The industry as a whole should play an important role in shaping the evolution of the settlement infrastructure. Other firms may seek to enter this market. There have also been discussions over time of a settlement utility, and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation is currently considering a new variant of such a model. Our focus is on the quality of the services offered-their safety, resilience, and support of the market-and not on the particular mechanism for offering them. If new proposals come forward that are consistent with our goals of a safe and resilient settlement system, then they will receive fair consideration. 1  Report to the Federal Reserve Board by the Working Group on NewBank Implementation (PDF), December 2005. 2 See Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (2012), Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures , report (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for International Settlements, April).
