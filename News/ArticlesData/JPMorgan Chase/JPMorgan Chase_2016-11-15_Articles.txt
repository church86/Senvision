By Saleha Mohsin, Kevin Cirilli and Jennifer Jacobs Bloomberg News  November 15, 2016 Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner Steven Mnuchin has been recommended by Donald Trump’s transition team to serve as Treasury secretary, according to two people familiar with the process, and the choice is awaiting the president-elect’s final decision. Mnuchin, the campaign’s national finance chairman, has been considered the leading candidate for the job. Trump has displayed a pattern of loyalty to his closest campaign allies in early administration selections, and Mnuchin, 53, had signed on at a time when many from Wall Street stayed away. Advertisement Before joining Trump, Mnuchin rose through the kind of elite institutions the president-elect spent his campaign vilifying. Mnuchin was tapped into Yale’s Skull and Bones secret society, became a Goldman Sachs partner like his father before him, ran a hedge fund, worked with George Soros, funded Hollywood blockbusters and bought a failed bank, IndyMac, with billionaires including John Paulson. They renamed it OneWest, drew protests for foreclosing on U.S. borrowers, and ultimately generated considerable profits, selling the business last year to CIT Group Inc. for $3.4 billion. Mnuchin, who co-founded hedge fund Dune Capital Management LP, was seen at Trump Tower on Monday. Asked by reporters why he was there, he said, “I’m here just helping with the transition this week. A lot of work to do.” He had no immediate comment when reached about the Treasury post. Get Business Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here The transition team also was said to be considering investor Wilbur Ross Jr., Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. Ross didn’t respond to requests for comment. Hensarling said last week he would “certainly have the discussion” if Trump’s administration called, but that he isn’t pursuing the post. A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment. Trump hasn’t yet made a final decision. Mnuchin would become the third former Goldman Sachs executive to head the Treasury since the mid-1990s. Robert Rubin and Hank Paulson both ran the Wall Street firm before becoming Treasury chiefs under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, respectively. Advertisement It’s a longstanding pattern that has earned Goldman the nickname “Government Sachs,” and it currently extends to the Federal Reserve and abroad. New York Fed President William Dudley is the firm’s former chief U.S. economist. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney was a managing director at the firm. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi was vice chairman of its international arm. ‘Smart Guy’ On Sunday, Trump named another Goldman alumnus, the former Breitbart News chief Steve Bannon, to one of his top posts in his White House, chief strategist and senior counselor. Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein praised Mnuchin at a conference in New York last week as a “very smart guy,” who rose quickly within the firm. “I have followed his career, and I know what he has done, but I haven’t engaged with him much since then,” Blankfein said. The company’s stock has climbed 15 percent since the Nov. 8 election. The next Treasury chief’s challenges will include a budget deficit that’s forecast to widen and require increased debt issuance; an economy that’s been stuck in a period of slow growth and exacerbated income inequality; and international partners wary about the new president’s approach to trade. During the campaign, the real estate mogul indicated that among his first moves will be a Treasury designation naming China a currency manipulator. Joining the campaign this year, Mnuchin was charged with a seemingly insurmountable task: Go up against the Hillary Clinton money machine that was out-organizing and out-raising Trump. The campaign had no organized fundraising operation because Trump relied mostly on his own money to get through the primaries. So Mnuchin essentially outsourced much of the work to others. He relied heavily on the Republican National Committee’s digital and direct-mail expertise to amass small-dollar donations. And a group of former RNC bigwigs helped form the core of a new Trump network to gather big checks at dinners where seats could cost $50,000 or more. Ultimately, Mnuchin’s role was less rainmaker and more chief financial officer: He weighed in on schedules and venues, proofread fundraising e-mails, rearranged chairs at dinners, and even helped set up the process that Trump Tower campaign staff used to open the mail. Tax Breaks He also took particular interest in tax policy. He argued that Trump’s tax plan should cut the top marginal rate to 33 percent, prevailing over other Trump advisers who had advocated for even lower figures, he said in an interview in August.  “He made the case this would be politically problematic,” said Stephen Moore, another Trump policy adviser, in a separate August interview. “That Trump would get skewered if it were perceived as a big tax cut for the rich.” By cutting the top rate from 39.6 percent, the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimates that almost half of the benefits of the Trump tax cut would fall to the top 1 percent of U.S. earners. If Mnuchin is confirmed for the Treasury role, it could save him millions in taxes. A 1989 rule allows him to sell stock tax-free if he reinvests the proceeds in Treasuries or in government-approved funds. The loophole was designed for executives who need to sell shares to comply with conflict-of-interest rules. Paulson’s Savings Mnuchin owns $97 million of CIT Group, according to a February ownership filing, the latest available. Because he received most of those shares when CIT purchased OneWest Bank in 2015, the exact cost basis that would be used to calculate his taxes isn’t immediately clear. Previous Treasury secretaries have taken advantage of the rule. Hank Paulson was eligible to save about $48 million on roughly $495 million of Goldman Sachs shares when he was nominated to run the department in 2006, the New York Times reportedat the time. Trump’s transition team signaled last week that it wants to dismantle key parts of the Dodd-Frank Act, the sweeping overhaul of U.S. financial regulation aimed at preventing future crises. Asked about the 2010 law before the election, Mnuchin said there are good and bad things about it, without elaborating. Goldman Experience Mnuchin started his career in the early 1980s as a trainee at Salomon Brothers. He went on to spend 17 years at Goldman Sachs, where a mentor showed him how the firm could profit from the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s, buying up assets cheap. Mnuchin oversaw mortgage-backed-bond trading at Goldman before becoming the investment bank’s chief information officer in 1999. He left in 2002 and two years later founded Dune Capital, named for a spot near his house in the Hamptons. The 2008 financial crisis lured Mnuchin back into banking. That summer, he was in his New York office when he saw a TV news shot of customers lined up outside a branch of IndyMac, a California lender, trying to pull out their money. “This bank is going to end up failing, and we need to figure out how to buy it,” he told a colleague, recalling the lessons of the savings and loan crisis. “I’ve seen this game before.” The bank collapsed that July, just months before Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s failure set off a global emergency. At one of the murkiest moments of the crisis, Mnuchin gathered investors for a $1.6 billion bid to buy IndyMac. He got an agreement that guaranteed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. would absorb almost all the loan losses after a certain threshold. He renamed the bank OneWest. Within a year, it was profitable. ‘Foreclosure Machine’ In October 2011 about 100 protesters marched on his Los Angeles mansion, angry about foreclosures. “Steve Mnuchin,” one sign read, “Stop taking our homes.” He and his partners completed the bank’s sale in August 2015. California Reinvestment Coalition deputy director Kevin Stein, whose group has accused OneWest of particularly aggressive foreclosure practices, criticized Mnuchin’s legacy on Monday. “Mr. Mnuchin oversaw a foreclosure machine,” Stein said in an e-mail. Taking the brunt were “working-class families, communities of color and seniors.” Loading comments...

The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which tracks 10 regional currencies, is down 2 percent this year. As recently as August it was up 1.7 percent. Emerging assets have tumbled in the past week as the president-elect is seen unleashing a spending surge, pushing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ US stocks closed little changed on Monday after rising dramatically the week before and a decline in the technology sector offset a steep rise in financial stocks as investors bet on higher interest rates. After choppy trading late in the session, the Dow ended at a record high while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite dipped. "I think all we're doing is trimming our sails a little from the violently positive rally we had post-election results last week," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has been under pressure since the Nov. 8 election as investors poured money into sectors such as financials, industrials and energy, which are seen benefiting from President-elect Donald Trump's policies. The financial index rose 2.3 per cent, with banks including Bank of America JPMorgan providing the biggest boost. The index has risen 10.8 per cent since the election on hopes of deregulation and higher interest rates. While the financial rally gained steam, the S&P technology index closed down 1.7 per cent, leading the decliners. The index has fallen 3 per cent since the election. Apple fell 2.5 per cent and weighed the most on the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, followed by Facebook and Microsoft. Since technology valuations have soared in recent years, investors are switching money to sectors such as banks, which has been relatively cheaper but should now benefit from rising interest rates, said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. Investors have been betting technology will look relatively less attractive if Trump lives up to his promise to review regulation in healthcare and financial sectors and to increase government spending on infrastructure to boost economic growth. "If growth becomes more even and available, we may see a continuation of rotation into lower-valuation, more cyclical businesses and out of high-valuation growth stocks like technology," said James Abate, chief investment officer at Centre Asset Management in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 21.03 points, or 0.11 per cent, to 18,868.69, the S&P 500 lost 0.25 points, or 0.01 per cent, to 2,164.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 18.72 points, or 0.36 per cent, to 5,218.40. The US Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at its December meeting, with traders pricing in a 91-per cent chance, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The industrial index finished up 0.4 per cent, buoyed by prospects for increased infrastructure outlays. Harman International rose 25.2 per cent to $109.72 after Samsung Electronics announced an $8 billion deal to buy the company. Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.44-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 82 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 423 new highs and 31 new lows.

EQY, +6.82% today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement (“Agreement”) under which Equity One will merge with and into Regency, with Regency continuing as the surviving public company and creating the preeminent shopping center Real Estate Investment Trust (“REIT”). The resulting enterprise will have industry-leading operating, development, redevelopment capacities as well as an unparalleled portfolio of primarily grocery-anchored properties uniquely positioned to sustain growth in net operating income (“NOI”) and create value for all of its stakeholders. The combined company is expected to have a pro forma equity market capitalization of approximately $11.7 billion and a total market capitalization of $15.6 billion, making it the largest REIT by equity value in the shopping center index. “Bringing together these two highly complementary businesses creates a best-in-class platform capable of delivering sustained growth and value creation over the long-term,” said Martin E. “Hap” Stein, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Regency. “Shareholders of both companies are poised to benefit from an expanded presence in top metro areas, a higher organic growth profile, expanded development and redevelopment program, and greater tenant diversity. Through this transaction we are creating the nation’s preeminent shopping center REIT with excellent embedded growth potential. Importantly, we expect the transaction to be accretive to core FFO per share while preserving a sector-leading balance sheet, with greater financial flexibility to support growth initiatives.” “This merger will be a transformative event for both companies,” said David Lukes, Chief Executive Officer of Equity One. “The alignment of our respective portfolios, development/redevelopment pipelines, industry-leading operations, and access to a lower cost of capital, opens us to new avenues of growth that will benefit all shareholders. Equity One shareholders are receiving an attractive valuation for the company’s assets, and have the opportunity to participate in the future growth prospects of a powerful new company led by a best-in-class management team.” Under the terms of the Agreement, each share of Equity One common stock will be converted into 0.45 shares of newly issued shares of Regency common stock. On a pro forma basis, following the closing of the transaction, Regency shareholders are expected to own approximately 62 percent of the combined company’s equity, and former Equity One shareholders are expected to own approximately 38 percent. The merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of both Regency and Equity One shareholders. The parties currently expect the transaction to close during the first quarter or early second quarter of 2017. This strategic transaction was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of both companies. The merger will create a national portfolio of 429 properties encompassing more than 57 million square feet, including co-investment partnerships, and located primarily in high density in-fill and affluent trade areas. The combination will provide increased penetration within key target areas, broader tenant diversity, and meaningful balance sheet capacity. As a result, the combined company will feature the attributes necessary to deliver consistent NOI growth, along with the capabilities to pursue accretive capital deployment opportunities through disciplined development and intense asset management. Summary of Strategic Benefits The merger of Regency and Equity One uniquely positions the combined company to enhance shareholder value as the preeminent grocery-anchored shopping center REIT: Unparalleled Portfolio of High-Quality Centers: Increased concentration in higher density, in-fill metro areas. The company’s five largest areas of Southern and Northern California; Southeast Florida; New York; and the Washington / Baltimore corridor, which together will represent more than 50 percent of total annualized rent, increases density by more than 30 percent and demographic purchasing power by 15 percent. Enhanced NOI Growth Profile: The high quality of the combined platform provides for significant and sustainable embedded NOI and net asset value growth opportunities. Expanded Value-Creation Opportunities: The combined best-in-class national development, redevelopment, and leasing platform is positioned to produce industry-leading performance. Greater Diversity of High-Quality Tenants: The top 10 tenants of the combined company, which include category-leading grocers and retailers such as Publix, Kroger, Whole Foods, and TJX, will represent approximately 18 percent of total ABR, with no single tenant representing more than approximately three percent. Superior Financial Strength and Flexibility: With enhanced size and scale, the combined company will maintain a conservative balance sheet with the flexibility to pursue compelling investment opportunities. Annualized Operating Cost Savings: The combined company expects to realize approximately $27 million in annual run-rate cost savings by 2018, primarily related to the elimination of duplicative corporate and property-level operating costs. In addition, the combined company expects to realize additional synergies from economies of scale, increased operational efficiencies and its ability to augment an already-talented team. Leadership and Organization Both the Board of Directors of Regency and the Board of Directors of Equity One unanimously approved the transaction. The number of directors on Regency’s Board of Directors will be increased to 12, of which two directors designated by Equity One and one director designated by Gazit-Globe will be appointed to the Regency Board. Mr. Stein will serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the combined company, and Regency’s President and Chief Financial Officer, Lisa Palmer, Executive Vice President of Development, Mac Chandler, and Executive Vice President of Operations, James Thompson, will continue in their respective roles at the combined company. Chaim Katzman, current Chairman of Equity One and Gazit-Globe’s designee on the Regency Board, will serve as non-executive Vice Chairman of the combined company. Gazit-Globe, which owns approximately 34 percent of the outstanding stock of Equity One, has agreed to vote in favor the transaction. John C. Schweitzer will continue to serve in his role as lead director for Regency. Upon completion of the merger, the company’s headquarters will remain in Jacksonville, Florida. The company will retain the Regency name and will continue to trade under the ticker symbol REG (NYSE). Pro Forma Operations and Balance Sheet Both companies own and operate high-quality grocery-anchored shopping centers located in fundamentally strong areas throughout the country. On a pro forma basis, the combined company will have an increased presence in higher-density, in-fill trade areas and enhanced tenant diversification. Given the complementary assets and operations of the two companies, the combined platform has meaningful opportunities for synergies, and margin improvement is expected. The combined company expects to increase cash flow at the property level by marking rents to market rates, realizing contractual rent increases, growing small shop occupancy and re-merchandising. In addition, the combined company is expected to have greater liquidity, a strong investment-grade balance sheet and a well-staggered debt maturity profile supported by long-standing relationships. Dividend Policy and Declaration Each company is expected to continue its ordinary course dividend policy during the pendency of the merger, and will also pay a pro-rated pre-closing dividend, so as to equalize the dividend payment dates and periods for each company. Advisors J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is acting as financial advisor, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz is acting as legal advisor, to Regency. Barclays is acting as lead financial advisor, Citigroup Global Markets Inc. is acting as co-financial advisor, and Kirkland & Ellis LLP is acting as legal advisor to Equity One. ICR, LLC served as communications advisor for the transaction. Conference Call The companies will host a joint conference call on Monday, November 14, 2016 at 7:00 pm EST to discuss the proposed merger. Participants will include Mr. Stein, Regency’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ms. Palmer, Regency’s President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Lukes, Equity One’s Chief Executive Officer, and Matthew L. Ostrower, Equity One’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

"I smell a trade war. That is what I think this market has become all about," the "Mad Money" host said. Stocks initially rallied last week from the prospects of tax cuts and infrastructure and defense spending. On Monday, however, investors finally realized that President-elect Trump could crack down on trading partners who take advantage of the U.S. market without opening theirs, Cramer said. They are starting to see what it could mean if Trump does more than just talk tough about imports and dumping. Apple shares declined more than 2 percent on Monday, revealing the company's vulnerability to a Trump regime. "Trump has stated repeatedly that Apple should make more products here. Apple might be caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place ... I know the Chinese picked the wrong day to single out Apple," Cramer said. Carlo Allegri | Reuters A ship is unloaded in Miami, Florida. Harman International Industries CEO Dinesh Paliwal told Cramer on Monday that he is thrilled that Samsung Electronics is acquiring the company for $8 billion. "Frankly when we see that the integration of these two companies, when we put it together, this is really dynamite because it's so complimentary," Paliwal said. Shares of Harman skyrocketed 25 percent on the news that Samsung is acquiring the company for $112 per share, a nearly 28 percent premium over where it traded on Friday. It signaled a major push for Samsung into auto-related technology. Moving forward, Paliwal added that he plans to double down in cybersecurity. He believes that the threat has now extended into individuals homes, cars and personal devices. Cyberark Software's CEO Udi Mokady echoed the same sentiment to Cramer on Monday, stating that anything connected to the internet can be hacked. Cyberark is the Israeli cybersecurity company that helps companies to protect administrator and privileged accounts. These are the accounts frequently targeted by hackers with the aim of getting the "keys to the kingdom." Mokady commented on the changing landscape of the cybersecurity industry. "I think in the last couple of years we have seen a change. It's called the post-breach proactive security measure," Mokady said. "We are coming in ahead of time to help secure against these advanced attacks, but we are seeing that the modern day customer is thinking 'OK we will be breached, let's make sure it's contained.'" Ashlee Espinal | CNBC Dinesh Paliwal, Harman International CEO Bank stocks have also rebounded since the presidential election. Cramer noted that all of the signals were there for investors to buy the banks, starting when JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon purchased 500,000 shares in the open market for $26.6 million on Feb. 11. With JPMorgan closing at $79 on Monday, those shares are worth nearly $40 million. "Maybe Dimon was lucky. Maybe he's just good. Either way, he's obviously still optimistic about JPMorgan, or else he would have taken up Trump on his offer to be Treasury secretary," Cramer said. After years of outperformance, the stock of CVS Health suffered a 10-point straight decline last week, leading Jim Cramer to wonder if it is a broken company or merely a broken stock. "CVS has gone from a market darling to a total dog, as its once-vaunted pharmacy benefit manager business has become an albatross around its neck and the company loses share to its rivals," Cramer said. Shares of CVS tripled from the summer of 2011 to the summer of 2015, but then fell into free-fall. They closed at $76 on Monday. The business includes both its 7,800 retail pharmacies, and its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) segments. "Maybe they can turn things around, but for now, CVS remains in the penalty box until we see them take concrete steps to lessen their dependence on what was once the golden goose, now just a turkey headed for a carving," Cramer said. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few caller favorite stocks: American Tower: "There was a piece out today that Sprint might merge with T-Mobile and everybody decided to dump on American Tower. My thinking is when you get this kind of a move, you've got to wait until tomorrow mid-day because there are so many sellers out there." AmSurg Corp: "This group is under pressure. Everything is so in flux in healthcare because of the new President that we just have to be on the sidelines. It's tough, because it looks so inexpensive. But sidelines is where we have to be."

Trump's presidency is expected to drastically shake up things in Washington. Dodd-Frank, fiduciary rule likely to be first targets in expected GOP overhaul By Hazel Bradford | November 14, 2016 Reprints Print Related Content Stories Rough times at Och-Ziff Capital Money managers ready for shift on European interest rates As Republicans gain control of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives for the first time in a decade, they face both the opportunity and challenge of turning their agen-da into reality. For President-elect Donald J. Trump, it is an ambitious agenda that includes overhauling the U.S. tax code, dismantling the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and halting or undoing other regulations that he says burden businesses, such as the Department of Labor fiduciary rule. He also has pledged to invest heavily in infrastructure and other measures to stimulate economic growth. Missing from the immediate agenda is retirement. “Aside from a Trump campaign promise to strengthen Social Security that did not include details, I don't see retirement policy at the forefront,” said Will Hansen, senior vice president of retirement policy for the ERISA Industry Committee in Washington. Republicans in the House and Senate, who retained their majority status, share the president-elect's interests, but have their own ideas on how to achieve them. In the Senate, Republicans' slim majority means they will have to work with Democrats to avoid filibusters. Both houses also will have to figure out how to work with Mr. Trump, who ran as a populist, even under the Republican banner. “(Mr.) Trump is much less predictable,” than previous presidents-elect said Erik Knutzen, multiasset-class chief investment officer at Neuberger Berman LLC. “He is very inexperienced when it comes to governing.” Mr. Trump's tax reform ideas illustrate the challenge. His campaign platform called for tax cuts that would cost $4.4 trillion in new federal revenue over 10 years. It includes popular ideas such as slashing corporate and business income rates to 15% from the current top rate of 35% and reducing rates for partnerships that use pass-through accounting, including private equity firms, but it also would end corporations' ability to defer paying taxes on their overseas income. His campaign to end what he called “special-interest loopholes” includes getting rid of the special tax treatment of carried interest. It's the “proverbial political football,” said National Venture Capital Association President and CEO Bobby Franklin, who said Mr. Trump “misunderstands” the value of carried interest. Michael Bresson, a tax partner with law firm Baker Botts LLP in Houston, sees the carried interest talk as mostly symbolic. “He was running as a populist and that was a popular proposal. It is not part of other Republicans' plans,” he said, noting that having one party in control doesn't guarantee success. “There is a variety of plans that have been floated, so everybody needs to agree on a plan. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of talk. Who knows if they can all come together?” There is more consensus among Republicans about dismantling Dodd-Frank, but critics argue much of it already has been implemented, and wholesale repeal would attract a lot of unwelcome attention from Wall Street watchdogs like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. Mr. Trump also will have to compare proposals with House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, an outspoken advocate for repeal. The same is true for the fiduciary rule, scheduled to take effect in April 2017. “It's pretty likely that an emboldened Congress will take aim at things like the DOL rule,” said Robert Dannhauser, head of global private wealth management at the CFA Institute in New York. “We think that's regrettable.” Erasing it completely could be tricky because financial services most affected by the rule already have begun overhauling their systems, and investors are more aware of it, he said. “In some ways what we've gone through has been good in informing the marketplace and investors. I would hope that the whole process has opened everyone's eyes,” said Mr. Dannhauser. A resolution to block the rule that was passed by both chambers along party lines earlier this year was vetoed by President Barack Obama in June, but could reappear now. Delaying fiduciary rule Delaying the rule's implementation is another option, said Kent Mason, partner in law firm Davis & Harman LLP who represents financial services firms. “It was always unrealistic to expect an entire industry to be structured in 12 months. Investors will be harmed if advisers are not fully ready on this unrealistic schedule.” “This rule needs to be reviewed thoroughly so that it does not create an advice gap like the one that is occurring in the United Kingdom under a very similar rule. It would make sense for the new administration to step back and take a careful look at the issues,” said Mr. Mason, who points to the precedent set by Mr. Obama in 2009 in delaying a previous fiduciary rule. Early in 2017, Mr. Trump and congressional leaders will have to make potentially unpopular decisions over how to fund the government, including raising the federal government's borrowing power, as the debt ceiling is expected to be reached by March. That will pit members of Congress against Mr. Trump's economic growth policies, which the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated would increase the national debt by $5 trillion, sending it from the current 77% of GDP to as high as 105%. CRFB officials note the Congressional Budget Office projects that real, inflation-adjusted growth will average 2% over the next decade, while Mr. Trump said his plans would grow the economy by 4%, a rate of sustained growth not seen since the early 1970s. “(Mr.) Trump has argued the lower tax rates will stimulate more economic growth and thus pay for themselves. This will not happen, suggesting larger budget deficits and a higher debt load down the road,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in a postelection analysis that called the Trump victory “a black swan” event. Helping Mr. Trump navigate these deals will be some seasoned investment executives. Mr. Trump's national campaign finance chairman, Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs Group (GS) Inc. executive who later formed hedge fund Dune Capital Management, is considered on the short list for Treasury secretary, along with Mr. Hensarling and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Chairman and CEO James “Jamie” Dimon. Economic post appointments are being handled by William Walton and former Bear Stearns chief economist David Malpass, a Treasury official under Ronald Reagan. Working with Mr. Malpass to place financial regulators at the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission is former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins, a frequent critic of Dodd-Frank who is now chief executive of consulting firm Patomak Global Partners LLC. Other members of the Trump economic advisory council include Thomas Barrack, executive chairman of investment firm Colony Capital Inc.; Anthony Scaramucci, founder of hedge funds-of-funds manager SkyBridge Capital, and John Paulson, president of hedge fund manager Paulson & Co. Leading the labor transition team is lobbyist J. Steven Hart, chairman of Washington law firm Williams & Jensen PLLC. Mr. Hart brings a good understanding of benefits issues from previous stints at the Department of Labor and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. It is a role he will reprise from Ronald Reagan's transition, where Mr. Hart was part of a reorganization task force on the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. A Williams & Jensen report on presidential transitions notes that “an incoming president faces significant challenges in rescinding regulations that were adopted and finalized before the end of the prior administration.” 4,000 political appointees Installing a new administration is cumbersome, at best. According to The Partnership for Public Service, a non-partisan organization in Washington, there will be more than 4,000 political appointees to name, starting with 1,212 senior posts requiring Senate confirmation, such as cabinet secretaries and deputies, independent agency heads and ambassadors, and another 353 appointments, including White House staff, who don't need Senate confirmation. Without a long-standing relationship with members of Congress, Mr. Trump is expected to rely on, and expect more, from his cabinet, said John Hudak, deputy director of Brookings Institution's Center for Effective Public Management, at a postelection briefing. “We're going to see cabinet secretaries really held accountable. You might see a lot of appointee turnover early in the administration.” Steven Friedman, senior investment strategist at BNP Paribas Investment Partners in New York, sees potential for a pro-growth package to emerge in the first half of next year. “It depends on which Trump governs — Trump the populist or Trump the pragmatist. Until this becomes clear, we could be in a period where there is more of a political risk premium in markets,” said Mr. Friedman. Experts at Mercer LLC are encouraged that the Republican sweep “could provide an opportunity to address the country's longer-term structural problems,” including the growth in entitlement programs and a complex tax system that dampens economic growth. “However, Trump's tax plans as presented would dramatically reduce government revenues and increase deficits. This could put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates,” they said in an analysis. That could change the Federal Reserve's role significantly, including who succeeds Chairwoman Janet Yellen when her term ends in 2018 and who fills two other current vacancies. When it comes to bond markets, said Rick Rieder, managing director and global chief investment officer of fixed income at BlackRock (BLK) Inc. (BLK), in a statement, “we are probably going to see a significant shift from monetary policy stimulus to fiscal policy initiatives,” particularly in federal infrastructure investment. “The ultimate economic impact will depend on what economic policies the new administration will actually pursue,” said Mr. Zandi of Moody's. “A Republican-controlled House and Senate will smooth the way for more policy becoming law.” Reprints Print Filed under: Google News - Editors Picks, News, Economy, Elections, Markets, CHART CENTRAL View Full Chart Bank stocks jump on election results View More Charts LATEST POLL View Older Polls LATEST SLIDESHOW Largest index managers: 2016 Take a look at the top 10 largest index managers.

TODAY file photo mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 12:55 PM, November 15, 2016 SINGAPORE — A gauge of Asian currencies reached its weakest level since April 2009 as the dollar’s strength prompts investors to sell emerging-market assets. All major Asian currencies have declined against the US dollar since Mr Donald Trump’s unexpected win in the US presidential election on Nov 8. Malaysia’s ringgit and South Korea’s won lost at least 2.8 per cent each. A gauge of the greenback erased its losses this year as US Treasury yields surged on speculation Mr Trump’s pro-growth policies will stoke inflation. “What’s driving the weakness in Asian currencies are the higher US bond yields,” said head of Asia research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Khoon Goh in Singapore. “Higher US yields tend to be negative for capital flows in the region. On top of that there’s also a general uncertainty about Mr Trump and his administration’s foreign policy toward Asia, China in particular.” The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index dropped 1.6 per cent since Nov 8, taking this year’s loss to 1.9 per cent. The gauge declined 0.1 per cent to 104.29 as of 10.37am in Singapore on Tuesday (Nov 15), after touching the 104.26, the weakest level since 2009. Funds based overseas have withdrawn in total this month a net US$5.3 billion (S$7.4 billion) across six of the region’s stock markets, including India, South Korea and Taiwan, exchange data show. They cut their holdings of Thai bonds by US$816 million. US 10-year yields have risen 36 basis points to 2.21 per cent since the presidential vote. Traders see a 92 per cent chance the Fed will raise interest at its December meeting, up from 76 per cent odds on the Friday before the election, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on futures.

A portion of the ADSs will be issued and sold by the company and a portion by certain shareholders, the company said. The selling shareholders include Trivago’s founders. In 2012, Expedia paid 477 million euros ($531 million) for a 62 percent stake in Trivago. Expedia, which is not selling any ADSs, and its affiliates will hold Class B shares after the IPO, the company said. Expedia Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi told investors in July that management and Trivago’s founding team had agreed to an IPO to value Trivago as a standalone company. Monday’s filing did not reveal how many shares the company planned to sell or their expected price. Trivago plans to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “TRVG.” JPMorgan Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs & Co and Morgan Stanley & Co LLC are the underwriters to the offering. The amount of money a company says it plans to raise in its first IPO filings is used to calculate registration fees. The final size of the IPO could be different.

Technology companies like Apple and Microsoft took big losses on fears about their overseas revenue, but bank stocks continued to surge along with bond yields. Technology stocks have been weak since last week’s election, and they fell further Monday as investors wonder if Donald Trump’s policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas. Bank stocks built on their post-election gains as bond yields continued to rise. That paves the way for banks to make more money from lending. Government bond yields are now at their highest levels since January. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to close at 18,868.69, another all-time high. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index dipped 0.25 points to 2,164.20 after it fell as much as 0.4 percent earlier. The Nasdaq composite sank 18.72 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,218.40. Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple gave up $2.72, or 2.5 percent, to $105.71 while Facebook declined $3.94, or 3.3 percent, to $115.08 and Microsoft slid 90 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $58.12. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $18.53, or 2.4 percent, to $753.22. Bond prices fell and yields jumped as investors anticipated that Trump’s spending plans would lead to higher inflation and more government borrowing. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note climbed to 2.25 percent from 2.14 percent late Thursday. Bond trading was closed Friday for the Veterans’ Day holiday. The day before the Nov. 8 election, the yield was 1.83 percent. That’s a huge move for that benchmark rate. Goldman Sachs rose $5.24 percent, to 2.6 percent, to $209.18 and Bank of America rose $1.06, or 5.6 percent, to $20.08. JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.82, or 3.7 percent, to $79.51. South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes electronics for cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.07, or 25.2 percent, to $109.72. German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor’s stock rose $5.61, or 18.3 percent, to $36.29. The dollar rose against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.51 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0726 from $1.0845. Oil prices bounced back from a big loss early on. Benchmark U.S. crude slipped just 9 cents to $43.32 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 32 cents to $44.43 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 3 cents to $1.28 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2 cents to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 13 cents, or 5 percent, to $2.75 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $2.60 to $1,221.70 an ounce. Silver lost 49 cents, or 2.8 percent, to $16.89 an ounce. Copper picked up 1 cent to $2.52 a pound. France’s CAC 40 rose 0.4 percent and Germany’s DAX added 0.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares closed 0.3 percent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 percent after a strong reading on Japan’s economic growth. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent.

The Hang Seng Index ended the day up 0.46 per cent or 101.69 points at 22,323.91 while the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index jumped 0.59 per cent or 55.23 points to 9,398.10. The US dollar index, a measure of the greenback against a basket of global peers, was 0.23 per cent weaker in Asia on Tuesday, snapping a seven-day winning streak after reaching a one-year high of 100.11. The retreat of the US dollar left Asian markets firmer after US Treasury yields, at a one-year high on Monday, weighed on Hong Kong stocks, dragging them down 3.72 per cent in the previous two trading days. I treat today’s rise as a technical rebound after a big fall before Linus Yip Sheung-chi, First Shanghai Securities “I treat today’s rise as a technical rebound after a big fall previously,” said Linus Yip Sheung-chi, chief strategist at First Shanghai Securities. “I expect a fluctuation in Hong Kong stocks amid volatile global markets this year.” Tuesday’s gains were led by strong performances from health and personal care stocks, up 1.42 per cent, and insurance companies, which rose 1.37 per cent. China Life Insurance added 2.06 per cent to HK$19.8 and PICC Property and Casualty gained 2.53 per cent to HK$12.14. “With a weakening yuan, more Chinese mainland people will come to Hong Kong to buy insurance to hedge the risks of the weaker currency,” added Yip. “The trend will not change in the short term, I believe.” But restrictions on mainlanders using UnionPay to buy insurance investment products in Hong Kong continued to weigh on AIA Group, dragging it to its lowest level since July, as its stock lost 1.26 per cent to HK$47.20. The index-weighted stock Tencent rebounded slightly from a three-month low on Monday, increasing 0.31 per cent to HK$193.20 ahead of its third quarter results announcement on Wednesday. The Shenzhen Stock Exchange announced it will carry out its fifth system test on Saturday. The test paves the way for the official launch of the highly anticipated stock connect trading mechanism. However, Yip said he does not expect a strong impact from the new link. “Only some selective stocks are likely to jump, such as brokerages and technology companies,” he said. The new stock connect is unlikely to make a significant difference to southbound flows from the mainland since the Hong Kong-Shanghai Stock Connect has already been in place and is underperforming its asset quotas, according to Alex Wong Kwok-ying, asset management director at Ample Capital. “Asia basically is a closed ecosystem,” he said. “We don’t see much inflow from China to Hong Kong.” Also weighing on the markets are increasing concerns about the US Federal Reserve raising interest rates in its December meeting, according to Yip. While analysts still anticipate this will happen, Donald Trump’s win in the US presidential election could delay the move into next year. “If there’s tighter financial conditions as a result of this election, perhaps a rate rise will be off the table,” Mark Doms, managing director and senior economist at Nomura, said last week. “We continue to believe the Fed will raise rates in December... but risks have fallen,” said John Woods, chief investment officer for Credit Suisse in Asia-Pacific. On the mainland, the Shanghai Composite Index closed slightly down, falling 0.11 per cent to 3,206.99, while the CSI 300 — which tracks the large caps listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen — was 0.01 per cent lower at 3,429.87. The Shenzhen Component Index rose 0.46 per cent or 50.57 points to 10,958.10 while the Shenzhen Composite Index gained 0.48 per cent and the Nasdaq-style ChiNext was up 0.82 per cent to 2,179.30. China Vanke rose 4.82 per cent to 26.94 yuan in Shenzhen following China Evergrande Group’s announcement of an increased stake in the company. Overnight on Wall Street, there were mixed fortunes for US stocks. The decline in the technology sector dragged the Nasdaq Composite down 18.72 points, or 0.36 per cent, to 5,218.40. The S&P 500 broke a five-month winning streak with a 0.1 per cent loss, closing at 2,164.20, while the Dow Jones industrial average hit a new all-time high, adding 0.11 per cent on Monday to close at 18,868.69. Elsewhere in Asia, Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 lost 0.03 per cent to 17,668.15, the Seoul Kospi fell 0.35 per cent and Sydney’s All Ordinaries fell by 0.38 per cent.

Photo / 123rf Mary Jo White, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, announced Monday that she will step down nearly three years before the end of her term, clearing the way for President-elect Donald Trump to reshape the way Wall Street is regulated. The SEC, which polices Wall Street and the financial markets, has been a key part of the Obama administration's effort to rein in big banks following the 2008 financial crisis and prevent future taxpayer bailouts of the industry. The agency has pushed for more oversight of hedge funds and other asset managers, and established rules that make it more difficult for big banks to make risky bets on the markets. White, a former federal prosecutor, is known for a no-nonsense style and attempted to beef up the agency's enforcement efforts over the last three years, pushing for more companies to admit guilt and taking more cases to trial. But progressive Democrats were often critical of her efforts, complaining they did not go far enough. Trump has already indicated he would usher in a period of deregulation, including dismantling 2010's financial reform legislation, known as the Dodd Frank Act. He appointed Paul Atkins, an industry veteran, who has called Dodd Frank a "calamity," to lead the agency's transition. Atkins "is a guy in general who wants to let companies do their thing and not get in the way very much," Ian Katz, a financial policy analyst with the research firm Capital Alpha Partners, said of Atkins. "You would see a lighter touch on enforcement and a lighter hand on corporate governance issue broadly." Atkins served as an SEC commissioner for six years during the President George W. Bush administration. He could not immediately be reached for comment. In addition to replacing White, Trump will be able to fill two openings on the five-member commission. Trump could also chose to ignore the more than 20-year old tradition of allowing the opposing political party to pick its own representative on the commission, one industry official said, further bolstering his influence over the agency. Also, Thomas Curry, the head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, another important Wall Street regulator, has less than six months on his term. Together, the openings should give the Trump administration wide latitude to change the way Wall Street is regulated. Continued below. Related Content Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin agree in phone call to improve 'unsatisfactory' US-Russia relations, Kremlin says The best workplace in New Zealand named Cartoon: Lack of transparency "It is a game changer at the SEC. The commission is going to have a very different agenda over the next four years than it would have," said Edward Mills, a policy analyst at investment bank FBR Capital Markets. "In the long-term it is going to be a big tilt towards free markets. White took office with high expectations. The SEC had long suffered under the popular notion that it was slow, toothless tiger. White appeared to be someone who might change that reputation. Prior to her appointment, she had been a federal prosecutor who took on the terrorists behind the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 and the Mafia boss John Gotti. "You don't want to mess with Mary Jo," President Obama proclaimed while announcing her nomination in 2013. White moved quickly to set a new tone at the agency. Soon after taking office, she announced the SEC would begin requiring more companies to admit guilt as part of their settlements with the agency. It was a break from the SEC's nearly 100-year history of extracting monetary penalties from companies, which typically would neither admit or deny the charges lodged against them. "The SEC had more leverage than it realized," White said in a recent interview. Not requiring admissions of guilt could "undermine, at least, the perception of the strength of a settlement, the strength of its deterrence. In certain cases that public accountability, I think, is very important." Critics would later complain that many large banks were still able to settle SEC cases without admitting guilt and that the agency's toughest actions were reserved for smaller banks. The SEC also poured resources into improving its technical capabilities, hiring experts who could help it better track stock trading and catch fraud. The SEC's technical capabilities have "really been transformed over the last three years," White said. There have been several cases, including some involving insider trading, that would have been impossible without these advancements, she said. Examinations of trading patterns that used to take months, can now be done in hours, she said. But in the years since, the SEC has also been overwhelmed by the task of implementing dozens of rules called for under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law and the 2012 JOBS Act, which aims to make it easier for small businesses to raise money. The 4,000-person agency has tussled repeatedly with Congress and complained that as Wall Street became more complex it needed a bigger budget to keep up White ultimately became a target of progressive groups who questioned her resolve to crack down on Wall Street. In addition to serving as a prosecutor, White also spent years defending big banks, including Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, as a white-collar lawyer, they noted. And while White trumpeted that she had secured settlements with nearly 90 high-level executives for financial-crisis related misdeeds, critics noted that officials at some of the country's largest banks had emerged largely unscathed. Last year, CREDO Action, a liberal advocacy group, sent a "Dump (Mary Jo) Truck" around Washington, D.C., to mark the anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Another group put up billboards in the D.C. Metro system depicting White as a superhero missing in action and asking "Where is Mary Jo White?" White's unpopularity among some progressive Democrats was particularly pronounced when she found herself the target of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. In January, Warren issued a report arguing that U.S. companies get away with crimes that regular people don't because of weak enforcement. The SEC "is particularly feeble, often failing to use the full range of its enforcement toolbox," the report said. Then in June, Warren and White faced off during a Senate Banking Committee hearing. "A year ago I called your leadership at the SEC extremely disappointing," Warren said. "Today I am more disappointed than ever." White quipped: "I'm disappointed in your disappointment." But White's supporters, including many industry officials, say the criticism has been unwarranted. "As SEC chairs go, Mary Jo has been one of the very best," said Harvey Pitt, who was SEC chairman under former President George W. Bush. "No one in that position will go un-criticized. But, in my view, the criticism has been completely unwarranted." - Washington Post Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Currency Compare and convert world currencies.

Dallas County Community College District and Tarrant County College are helping students train for jobs in high-demand industries. For community colleges across Texas, success isn't always measured by how many degrees are given out at the end of the school year. Often, it's measured by a school's economic impact on the community it educates. That's why some local colleges have refocused their efforts on preparing graduates for higher-paying jobs with work-skills training. Tarrant County College (TCC) and Dallas County Community College District (DCCCD) have more than 100,000 enrolled students who are taking professional development classes, learning soft skills and seeking degrees for as little as $59 per credit hour.  "If you're coming from a family that didn't go to college, these programs may be a pivotal point that show an entire next generation that they are college material," said Liz Sisk, senior donor relations officer at the Tarrant County College Foundation. "There's a generational uplift that follows these first-gen students."  JPMorgan Chase released the Dallas Skills Gap Report in May 2015, part of its five-year $250 million initiative, New Skills at Work. The report identified both health care and IT as demand-driven workforce industries with major growth potential and detailed how to best train students for these fields. "We really want our students to advance in their careers and make living wages," said Shannon Ydoyaga of DCCCD. "That's why JPMorgan Chase has been so important to us, from a strategic standpoint, with their workforce initiative. They also see the importance of moving people out of poverty through higher education."  Using the research provided by JPMorgan Chase's report, TCC and DCCCD developed new health care-oriented training programs. For example, TCC works with students on "stackable credentials" so that wages can be increased based on new skills and related certificates.  JPMorgan Chase is helping community colleges in Dallas and Tarrant counties through workforce training programs. Training programs Similarly, DCCCD launched a training program called Project OnRamp (Opens Overlay). Enrollees in the program include tenured health care workers with 15 to 20 years of work experience at assisted-living facilities, but who are still earning low wages. OnRamp supports, advises and funds the purchase of school equipment for these workers as they complete their Patient Care Technician (PCT) certification coursework, often while working full time.  After completing the PCT exam, these students — with the help of OnRamp's career services coordinator — find better-paid positions. That may mean raising their hourly wage from $8 to $12 or $14, helping them move closer to a living wage.  Some of OnRamp's students have even gone on to be admitted to nursing school, a degree that can net $50,000-per-year salary positions. These success stories wouldn't be possible without the financial and academic support that students receive through the program.  Approximately 160 Project OnRamp students have now completed the program and an additional 15 will finish this fall. The hope is to continue the program with a new round of students next year. JPMorgan Chase sponsors both Tarrant County College and Dallas County Community College District workforce training programs through its New Skills at Work initiative. A global $250 million initiative, New Skills at Work aims to close the skills gap in demand-driven industries. Find out more about JPMorgan Chase's commitment to the Dallas-Fort Worth communities.

(Seth Wenig, File/Associated Press) By Marcy Gordon | AP November 14 WASHINGTON — The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mary Jo White, will leave office at the end of the Obama administration, the agency said Monday. White, a former federal prosecutor and private securities lawyer, was appointed by President Barack Obama in February 2013. Her term doesn’t end until 2019. President-elect Donald Trump is due to take office Jan. 20 and likely will name his own choice to head the market watchdog agency in the near future. His nominee could move to unwind restrictions on Wall Street banks and corporations. The Trump transition team has set as a goal to “dismantle” the Dodd-Frank reforms law enacted in response to the 2008 financial crisis. Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner who is the team’s point man for financial regulatory agencies, is an avowed opponent of regulating Wall Street. White, an Independent, has had to forge consensus amid sometime robust opposition from the two Republicans on the five-member commission. Republicans criticized her for what they saw as overreach by the agency that could stifle financial innovation and economic growth. Some Democrats, meanwhile, accused her of not being tough enough on Wall Street and top executives who may have contributed to the crisis. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the liberal Democratic leader who is a fiery critic of Wall Street, last month called on Obama to replace White over the issue of requiring publicly traded corporations to more fully disclose their political spending. Under questioning at a Senate hearing, White wouldn’t commit to getting the commission to adopt such a rule. She cited a Republican amendment to a catch-all government spending bill that prohibits the SEC from doing so. Warren and several other Democratic senators were angered by White’s position and by waffling on the issue by two long-pending Obama nominees to fill vacancies on the SEC. They blocked the nominations of the two candidates, a Democrat and a Republican. As a result, the five-member SEC has been down two since December 2015. The positions will likely be filled by Trump nominees. In its announcement Monday, the SEC noted a number of rules and policies that White shepherded during her tenure, including regulations under the landmark Dodd-Frank law. Also included were changes to shore up the stability of the money-market fund industry and new protections for mutual fund investors. The SEC also required financial firms that sell securities backed by mortgages or auto loans, like the kind that fueled the crisis, to give investors details on borrowers’ credit records and income. “My duty has been to ensure that the (SEC) implemented strong investor and market protections, and to establish an enduring foundation for future progress in the most critical areas,” White said in a statement. “Thanks to the hard work and dedication of the SEC’s staff, we have accomplished both.” Reflecting criticism from consumer and investor groups, Lisa Gilbert of Public Citizen called White “a disappointing chair.” “For more than three years, she stymied effective regulation from the SEC, slow-walking Dodd-Frank rules,” said Gilbert, who heads the group’s Congress Watch unit. And now, she added, the Trump administration “likely will nominate someone in her place who is even more skeptical of investor protections.” White, who was U.S. attorney in Manhattan from 1993 through 2002, compiled an extensive record of prosecuting white-collar crime, won convictions in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the 1998 terrorist attacks on two U.S. embassies in Africa, and put crime boss John Gotti away. Her 2013 nomination by Obama as the first prosecutor to lead the SEC was taken as a signal in some quarters that he wanted the government to get tougher with Wall Street. After leaving government, White worked for a decade as a corporate attorney at a New York-based firm, her blue-chip client roster including JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, General Electric and Toyota. That work prompted tough questioning by some senators at her confirmation hearing in March 2013. White promised that she would avoid potential conflicts of interest caused by her past legal work and that of her husband, who is a corporate attorney. She said her work for large banks and corporations didn’t mean that she had embraced their policies. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
