 Millennials aren't spending money like their parents did Matt Turner Sep. 14, 2016, 12:31 AM 35,435 facebook linkedin twitter email print A millennial at the Burning Man festival. Aly Weisman/Business Insider Millennials are spending their money differently from their parents and grandparents. Gordon Smith, chief executive for consumer and community banking at JPMorgan, gave a presentation on Monday at the Barclays Financial Services Conference discussing the spending patterns of millennials. JPMorgan is especially focused on this group, and we've written before about the bank spending big to land younger customers. The chart below shows what millennials and non-millennials purchased using Chase debit and credit cards in 2015. To clear up any confusion, JPMorgan defined millennials as those born between 1981 and 1997, while non-millennials are those born before 1981. You'll see that millennials spend a lot more on "experiences" — things like travel, entertainment, and dining. JPMorgan The spending patterns of the millennial generation are important, as they'll be shaping consumer demand for years to come. The compound annual growth rate in retail spending from this group is forecast to be 15% from 2014 to 2020, versus a 4% increase for those ages 35 and up.

That’s the first back-to-back reduction in so-called net short positions in sterling since Britain voted to leave the European Union in June. The U.K. currency gained versus all except one of its 16 major peers before a report Tuesday that economists forecast will show annual consumer-price inflation accelerated in August from a year ago at the fastest pace since November 2014. JPMorgan Chase & Co. revised up its year-end forecasts for the pound against the dollar and the euro, citing a resilient growth outlook. Monetary Policy Committee members led by Governor Mark Carney will announce their decision on Sept. 15. “We do sense a period of sterling stability, at least for now,” said Neil Jones, head of hedge fund sales at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in London. “U.K. economic performance after the Brexit vote is proving better than expected. On the political front, sentiment is shifting from immediate hard Brexit to a more prolonged but softer one.” The pound rose 0.3 percent to $1.3308 as of 4:06 p.m. in London, after sliding 1.3 percent in the previous three days. It strengthened 0.4 percent to 84.34 pence per euro, having depreciated 0.9 percent last week after the European Central Bank refrained from extending its monetary stimulus. Resilient Economy Sterling has outperformed all of its 16 major counterparts in the past month as reports from services to construction showed the U.K. economy was holding up better than some economists predicted, marking a turnaround from when the Brexit vote and the resulting stimulus from the BOE made it the worst performer. It touched a 31-year low of $1.2798 on July 6 and is still down 11 percent versus the dollar since the June 23 referendum. Short positions, or bets on the currency’s decline, outnumbered bullish wagers by 89,969 contracts last week, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data. That’s down from record 94,978 contracts in August, the most since Bloomberg started compiling the data in 1992. JPMorgan now sees the pound at $1.32 by the end of this year from $1.28 in its previous forecast, according to a report published on Monday. The bank revised its year-end forecast for the U.K. currency versus the euro to 87 pence from 90 pence previously. Sign up to receive the Brexit Bulletin, a daily briefing on the biggest news related to Britain's departure from the EU. BOE Outlook The BOE cut its main interest rate to a record in August and resumed its bond-buying program to head off the risk of an economic slowdown after the referendum, while lowering its growth forecasts. Data since have suggested that the U.K. economy is holding up. All the analysts in separate Bloomberg surveys predict the central bank will keep its key rate and asset-purchase target unchanged on Thursday. “The combination of Carney ruling out negative rates and better economic data has not left much room for maneuver for the market, which is not priced for much additional easing this year,” said Jane Foley, a senior foreign-exchange strategist at Rabobank International in London. “Any signal that the MPC could be seriously looking to ease in November is set to undermine the pound this week.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Sep 16, 2016 at 8:20PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. The Dow Jones Industrial Average contains 30 of the United States' biggest and best-known companies. Included among them are three banks: JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and American Express (NYSE:AXP). Bank Market Capitalization Net Income (TTM) Share Price JPMorgan Chase  $237.7 billion  $23.9 billion $65.82 Goldman Sachs  $67.3 billion  $5.2 billion $166.00 American Express  $237.7 billion  $23.9 billion $65.82 *As of Sept. 16, 2016. Data source: YCharts.com. Why did these three banks make the cut? There are multiple reasons why these three banks are included on the Dow while other banks are not. To this end, here's the selection criteria for Dow stocks: The index ... is a price-weighted measure of 30 U.S. blue-chip companies. The index covers all industries with the exception of transportation and utilities... While stock selection is not governed by quantitative rules, a stock typically is added to the index only if the company has an excellent reputation, demonstrates sustained growth and is of interest to a large number of investors. Maintaining adequate sector representation within the indices is also a consideration in the selection process The reasons why JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and American Express made the cut relate to their size, reputation, popularity, and the specific niches in which they operate. JPMorgan Chase is the largest bank in America based on market cap, which easily qualifies it as a blue chip company. It's been known since its founding more than a century ago for prudence and profitability. Most recently, while competitors such as Bank of America and Citigroup have had to retreat and retrench since the financial crisis, JPMorgan Chase took the opportunity to gain market share and continue growing, most notably through its government-assisted acquisitions of Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual in 2008. Goldman Sachs plays a similar role among stand-alone investment banks, being the biggest and most admired on Wall Street. As such, not only does it satisfy the blue chip requirement, but it also offers a pure play on a bank that makes its money from capital markets businesses -- trading and investment banking. Finally, although many people don't think of American Express as a bank, that's exactly what it is. Unlike Visa, which provides only the payment system's infrastructure -- connecting merchants, customers, and banks -- American Express also finances the loans underlying its credit card holders' accounts. In the most recent quarter, American Express earned $1.5 billion in net interest income alone, which supplemented its $6.8 billion in noninterest income -- things like annual fees and late fees. In short, it's no coincidence that these are three of the biggest and best-known bank stocks in the country, and that they're also included on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

(AP) Wells Fargo was, until last week, America's most valued money centre bank, the crown jewel of Warren Buffet's investment portfolio, a model of corporate excellence whose pedigree goes back to the rise of San Francisco as a financial hub in the 1850s after the California gold rush. Yet Wells Fargo is now mired in one of the most sordid scandals in post 2008 global banking. Wells Fargo retail bankers opened more than two million unauthorised accounts without the knowledge of clients to meet sales targets. The bank has fired more than 5,300 employees (its retail banking empire, called the Community Bank, has a payroll of 100,000) and its CEO John Stumpf, Mr Clean of banking will be grilled by a hostile Congress in the Senate. The bank's shares have plunged from a 52 week high of 56 to 46. While Goldman's Blankfein survived the Abacus CDO and J.P. Morgan's Jamie Dimon survived the London Whale scandal, Stumpf's scandal comes amid an election season where Big Banking is in the crosshairs of both Mrs Clinton and Trump. Wells Fargo has paid $185 million to settle charges but I can easily envisage criminal charges of property/identity theft against supervisors in the bank's California branch network. Warren Buffett owns 10 per cent of Wells Fargo, the biggest mortgage lender in the US that avoided the capital markets losses and toxic derivatives disasters of 2008. Wells Fargo has agreed to end its controversial incentive linked sales target and cross-selling strategies that led to this scandal. The fired retail bankers opened unauthorised accounts to hit sales targets and receive bonuses. It does not help Wells Fargo's public reputation that Carrie Tolstedt, the head of retail banking, has taken home $125 million in compensation. An executive pay clawback as mandated by Dodd Frank is now inevitable, as was the case in J.P. Morgan's London Whale trading scandal. It is entirely possible that Wells Fargo will have to pay much higher fees before this scandal is over. The bank's decision to eliminate incentive based product sales goals and cross selling targets will also hit its formidable retail banking revenue generation machine. After all, retail banking is 57 per cent of total revenue and 60 per cent of pretax income for Wells Fargo, the reason it enjoyed such a valuation premium in the stock markets. Carrie Tolstedt will not survive but the Senate Banking Committee could demand a wholesale purge of senior executives at the bank. The bank has faced huge reputational damage with investors, regulators and customers. This will distract senior management from new growth initiatives. I would only become interested in Wells Fargo shares if the bank falls to 40. It is impossible to quantify the legal bill and reputational damages the bank will face as Elizabeth Warren grills CEO john Stumpf in the Senate and the global media. United Technologies (UTX) is one of the world's most highly respected industrial conglomerates, the owner of such iconic brands at Pratt and Whitney aircraft engines, Otis elevator and HVAC systems. At 100, the bank trades at 14.5 times earnings based on a consensus 2017 estimate of $6.92 EPS. The company beat second quarter Street estimates thanks to stellar results in its Climate Controls and Security units, a business that generates 20 per cent plus operating margins and is the firm's growth engine. The shares have sagged due to exposure to the UK, European and Chinese building markets. However, I doubt if there is more than $7 downside in the shares even if Wall Street gets ugly in October. This means downside at UTX is limited to 94 or 13.4 times forward earnings at a time when management is poised to raise guidance and implement a share buyback that could be at least three per cent of market capitalisation. United Technologies is a global industrial colossus because 45 per cent of its $56 billion revenue is recurrent and CEO Greg Hayes divested Sikorsky Helicopter for $9 billion to boost shareholder returns via buybacks. With a dividend yield of almost three per cent, this Dow 30 stock is in the value zone. A 94-120 trading range means the enables myriad money making options based strategies.

CLOSE Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Friday, November 18, 2016 Insider K Street Lifestyle Opinion Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Home Economy Treasury Penalizes Big Banks for Poor Work on Home Loan Modifications Policy Economy Treasury Penalizes Big Banks for Poor Work on Home Loan Modifications By Nigel Roberts - 1:00pm June 27, 2011 580 1 SHARE Facebook Twitter Three of the largest mortgage-service companies received a warning from the U.S. Treasury Department for failing to meet standards under the Home Affordable Modification Program. Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase need “substantial improvement,” the Treasury said in a June 9 report. Consequently, the Treasury will withhold financial incentive payments to the banks. The Home Affordable Modification Program pays mortgage-service companies $1,000 for each loan that is modified and $1,000 a year for three years if the borrower pays on time. Funding comes from $50 billion set aside from the bank bailout. This financial incentive to modify home loans is intended to encourage lenders to work with struggling homeowners rather than foreclose on their mortgages. The Treasury assesses participating mortgage-service companies in three categories of program implementation: identifying and contacting homeowners; homeowner evaluation and assistance; and program reporting, management and governance. “While we continue to get tens of thousands of new homeowners into mortgage modifications each month, we need servicers to step up their performance to meet the needs of those still struggling,” said acting Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad, in a statement. Massad continued: “These assessments set a new benchmark by providing an unprecedented level of disclosure around servicer performance and will serve to keep the pressure on servicers to more effectively assist struggling families.” Wells Fargo said the Treasury’s assessment “paints an unfairly negative picture” of the bank’s modification efforts. “We are formally disputing this with the Treasury,” Wells Fargo spokeswoman Teri Schrettenbrunner told Bloomberg News. The other banks also disputed the assessment. In a statement, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, praised the Obama administration for its enforcement action against the banks. Waters added that the three companies had developed the practice of foreclosing “on millions of homeowners, often without properly screening them for modifications or otherwise following program rules.” Waters said she considers the penalties “just a first step in straightening out the servicing industry.” Going forward, she plans to continue urging banking regulators to use their examination and enforcement authority “to clean up industry practices.” The foreclosure prevention program has harsh critics. It has been “an abysmal failure that hurt more homeowners than it has helped,” said Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-North Carolina, in a statement. He authored the Home Affordable Modification Program Termination Act and called on the Senate to approve his measure. In its statement, the Treasury defended the Obama administration’s efforts have helped struggling families to stay in their homes. It reported that more than 4.8 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of March 2011. According to the Treasury, about 29,000 homeowners received a trial modification in April, and 29,000 additional homeowners received a permanent modification with a median payment reduction of 37 percent — or more than $500 every month. The Treasury also cited Ocwen Loan Servicing LLC for poor performance. However, the agency did not penalize Ocwen because it had acquired a large servicing portfolio during the testing period.

(AP Photo/David Goldman) Share Written by Nicholas Tampio Obsession The Art of Parenting September 17, 2016 According to the grit narrative, children in the United States are lazy, entitled and unprepared to compete in the global economy. Schools have contributed to the problem by neglecting socio-emotional skills. The solution, then, is for schools to impart the dispositions that enable American children to succeed in college and careers. According to this story, politicians, policymakers, corporate executives and parents agree that kids need more grit. The person who has arguably done more than anyone else to elevate the concept of grit in academic and popular conversations is Angela Duckworth, professor at the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania. In her new book, Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance, she explains the concept of grit and how people can cultivate it in themselves and others. According to Duckworth, grit is the ability to overcome any obstacle in pursuit of a long-term project: “To be gritty is to hold fast to an interesting and purposeful goal. To be gritty is to invest, day after week after year, in challenging practice. To be gritty is to fall down seven times and rise eight.” Duckworth names musicians, athletes, coaches, academics and business people who succeed because of grit. Her book will be a boon for policymakers who want schools to inculcate and measure grit. There is a time and place for grit. However, praising grit as such makes no sense because it can often lead to stupid or mean behavior. Duckworth’s book is filled with gritty people doing things that they, perhaps, shouldn’t. Take Martin Seligman, the founder of positive psychology and Duckworth’s graduate school mentor. In a 1967 article, Seligman and his co-author describe a series of experiments on dogs. The first day, the dogs are placed in a harness and administered electrical shocks. One group can stop the shocks if they press their nose against a panel, and the other group cannot. The next day, all of the dogs are placed in a shuttle box and again administered shocks that the dogs can stop by jumping over a barrier. Most of the dogs who could stop the shocks the first day jumped over the barrier, while most of the dogs who suffered inescapable shock did not try, though a few did. Duckworth reflects upon this story and her own challenges in a college course in neurobiology. She decides that she passed the course because she would “be like the few dogs who, despite recent memories of uncontrollable pain, held fast to hope.” Duckworth would be like one of the dogs that got up and kept fighting.  Praising grit as such makes no sense because it can often lead to stupid or mean behavior. At no point, however, does Duckworth express concern that many of the animals in Seligman’s study died or became ill shortly thereafter. Nor does she note that the CIA may have employed the theory of “learned helplessness” to perform enhanced interrogation, regardless of Seligman’s stated opposition to torture. Duckworth acknowledges the possibility that there might be “grit villains” but dismisses this concern because “there are many more gritty heroes.” There is no reason to assume this, and it oversimplifies the moral universe to maintain that one has to be a ‘grit villain’ to thoughtlessly harm people. A second grit paragon in Duckworth’s book is Pete Carroll, the Super Bowl-winning coach of the Seattle Seahawks American football team. Carroll has created a culture of grit where assistant coaches chant: “No whining. No complaining. No excuses.” She also commends Seahawk defensive back Earl Thomas for playing with “marvelous intensity.” Duckworth has apparently not read any of the articles or seen any of the movies or television programs detailing the long-term harm caused by playing professional football. President Barack Obama, among others, has said that he would not want a son, if he had one, to play football. Duckworth might have talked with football players who suffer from traumatic brain injuries. Another role model, for Duckworth, is Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase. Dimon’s alma mater prep school has the motto of “grytte,” and Duckworth attributes JPMorgan Chase’s success to the grit of its leader: “In the 2008 financial crisis, Jamie steered his bank to safety, and while other banks collapsed entirely, JPMorgan Chase somehow turned a $5 billion profit.” There is no basis for the word “somehow” in this sentence. The Troubled Asset Relief Program provided JPMorgan Chase with $25 billion in 2008. In general, neither Duckworth nor the protagonists in her book dwell upon the political conditions that enable or thwart individual success. Duckworth gives many more troublesome examples. The CEO of Cinnabon who never reflects on how she contributes to the obesity epidemic in the US. The Spelling Bee champs who don’t love to read. The West Point cadets who have to endure a borderline-hazing initiation rite called Beast.  The opposite of grit, often enough, is thinking, wondering, asking questions, and refusing to push a boulder up a hill. Why don’t these people ever stop to think about what they are doing? We should not celebrate the fact that “paragons of grit don’t swap compasses,” as Duckworth puts it in her book. That might signal a moral failing on their part. The opposite of grit, often enough, is thinking, wondering, asking questions, and refusing to push a boulder up a hill. Right now, many Americans want the next generation to be gritty. Already, school districts in California are using modified versions of Duckworth’s Grit Survey to hold schools and teachers accountable for how well children demonstrate “self-management skills.” Duckworth herself opposes grading schools on grit because the measurement tools are unreliable. But that stance overlooks the larger problem of how a grit culture contributes to an authoritarian politics, one where leaders expect the masses to stay on task. Democracy requires active citizens who think for themselves and, often enough, challenge authority. Consider, for example, what kind of people participated in the Boston Tea Party, the Seneca Falls Convention, the March on Washington, or the present-day test-refusal movement. In each of these cases, ordinary people demand a say in how they are governed. Duckworth celebrates educational models such as Beast at West Point that weed out people who don’t obey orders. That is a disastrous model for education in a democracy. US schools ought to protect dreamers, inventors, rebels and entrepreneurs—not crush them in the name of grit.

Investors continue to remain on edge regarding the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at its meeting next week. Banks also fell, led by a plunge in Deutsche Bank after the giant German lender said it wouldn't settle with the Department of Justice over its handling of mortgage securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 88.68 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,123.80. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 8.10 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,139.16 and the Nasdaq composite fell 5.12 points, or 0.1 percent, to 5,244.57. The U.S.-listed shares of Deutsche Bank dropped $1.38, or 9 percent, to $13.38 after the bank said it did not intend to pay the $14 billion settlement that the U.S. government asked for. Federal regulators have been looking to settle with Deutsche Bank, as it has done with the other major Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co., for its role in the mortgage bubble and financial crisis. Other European banks fell as well. Royal Bank of Scotland Group fell 30 cents, or 6 percent, to $4.86. The news out of Deutsche Bank dragged European stocks lower, with Germany's DAX closing down 1.5 percent, France's CAC-40 index down 0.9 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index down 0.3 percent. Stocks have been volatile this week, with the Dow moving more than 100 points four out of five days. Most of the volatility has come as investors prepare for next week's Fed meeting. While most investors do not expect a rate increase, there is a small but noticeable likelihood there will be one. "By the Fed's own criteria, everything is in place for them to raise rates. But still, people don't think they are going to raise rates, so the market is in conflict," said David Kelly, chief global investment strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management. In other company news, pharmaceutical company Novavax plunged $7.05, or 85 percent, to $1.29 after the company said its experimental vaccine failed in late-stage clinical testing. Novavax has no active products on the market and this drug was their furthest in development. Intel rose $1.11, or 3 percent, to $37.67 after the company raised its revenue forecasts, citing stronger-than-expected demand for personal computers. The S&P 500 is adding a new industry to its traditional groups for the first time since the dotcom era. The benchmark stock index will now have a real estate sector, which will be split off from the financial services component. The new industry component will be effective at the end of trading Friday. After the split, the S&P 500 will have 11 industry sectors. The 10 current sectors of the S&P 500 are: financial services, information technology, energy, industrials, consumer discretionary companies, materials, telecommunications, consumer staples, health care and utilities. Benchmark U.S. crude lost 88 cents to $43.03 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, fell 82 cents to $45.77 per barrel.

Done Editing Tags 51 Comments Share this article 86 86 86 If this guy becomes president, expect more depressing charts and lots of red ink. In late 2007 and 2008, the United States and the global economy were devastated by the subprime crisis. That financial calamity was so named due to the hundreds of thousands of foreclosed upon homeowners who were unqualified for the loans they received from mortgage originators around the country. The disaster did not result from the borrowers' deceit or government policy to spur home ownership among lower-income Americans, but from an entire financial sector that was incentivized to loan them money whether they could pay it back or not. Banks and private mortgage firms offered the loans because companies like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and Goldman Sachs could "securitize" and sell the bundled mortgages insured by derivatives provided by, among others, AIG. It all worked for everyone, as long as the rating agencies like Fitch and Moody's gave them AAA ratings. And as long as housing prices kept going up. But when the bubble burst, trillions of dollars of wealth were wiped out and millions of Americans were left underwater. Now, as the country prepares to go the polls, Americans are running the risk of a new—and completely avoidable—subprime crisis of a different kind. On Nov. 8, voters will choose to "loan" the White House (and the all the power that goes with it) to either Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump. The tightening polls show a growing possibility that Americans will mortgage their futures to the reality TV star, despite 62 percent of respondents (including 23 percent of Republicans) saying Trump is not "qualified to serve as president.” But the bad risk Trump represents isn't limited to his temperament, intellect and judgment (or lack thereof). It's not just that his serial bankruptcies and dubious business practices can and do get him laughed out of bankers' offices. As it turns out, his repeated promises to pay for expanded defense spending, his maternity leave program, Medicare prescription drugs, Social Security, and more by cutting "waste, fraud, and abuse" doesn't pass either the giggle test or basic math. Worse still, a growing consensus of economists warn that the Subprime President Trump's mammoth tax cut windfall for the wealthy and balanced budget boasts would necessarily produce the next recession—or much worse. “I think it’s a great time to start a mortgage company.” Donald Trump, April 2006. It soon closed. Now, the record of businessmen in the White House is not a happy one. But Trump's past is particularly disturbing. After all, his businesses have declared bankruptcy four times in 1991, 1992, 2004, and 2009. As former rival turned endorser Florida Sen. Marco Rubio put it in February: "When his companies went bankrupt, the first people that didn't get paid were the subcontractors, the plumbers and the pipe-fitters, the people that laid bricks and all those people who worked for a living, they didn't get paid. He got his money." Donald Trump admitted in a New Jersey bankruptcy court that "I don't like the 'b' word." But he doesn't hesitate to boast about it as a routine business tactic, either. As he explained to ABC in 2011: "We'll have the company. We'll throw it into a chapter. We'll negotiate with the banks. We'll make a fantastic deal. You know, it's like on 'The Apprentice.' It's not personal. It's just business." But for many of Trump's customers, workers, contractors, and partners, it's bad business. Just ask the employees of the now-defunct Trump University, Trump Mortgage, Trump Airways, Trump Casino, and Trump Magazine. Catastrophic, too, for his business partners. As USA Today reported, during his career Trump and his various business entities have been involved in litigation an almost incomprehensible 3,500 times. Those cases include the fraud case against Trump University, a lawsuit against the Better Business Bureau, ongoing litigation surrounding the Trump Casino bankruptcy, and the fallout from a group of Hong Kong investors he stiffed. The Donald has a proven track record of failing to pay his bills on time, in full, or at all. (In July, a Florida painter won $34,000 and $300,000 in attorneys' fees in a case involving Trump's failure to pay him for work performed at his Doral golf resort.) The result, as the Wall Street Journal reported in March, is that the Trump Organization has been left with the German Deutsche Bank as its primary remaining source of financing: Other Wall Street banks, after doing extensive business with Mr. Trump in the 1980s and 1990s, pulled back in part due to frustration with his business practices but also because he moved away from real-estate projects that required financing, according to bank officials. Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and  Morgan Stanley  are among the banks that don't currently work with him. As Russ Choma and David Corn documented in June, his dealings with Deutsche Bank would immediately create a conflict of interest for President Trump, as "He owes at least $100 million to a foreign bank that's battled with US regulators." And given the Trump Organization's "deep ties to global financiers, foreign politicians and even criminals," Kurt Eichenwald warned in Newsweek, "If Trump moves into the White House and his family continues to receive any benefit from the company, during or even after his presidency, almost every foreign policy decision he makes will raise serious conflicts of interest and ethical quagmires." It's no surprise that Donald Trump has taken the unprecedented step of asking the American people for the electoral equivalent of a "no doc loan." That is, 40 years after the practice of candidates releasing their tax returns became routine (and 1,711 days after he advised Mitt Romney to "release them now"), Trump has refused to make his public. Like some subprime borrowers of the early 2000s, The Donald seems to believe he need not provide proof of income and assets to get what he wants. And as I noted last week in "Defining Trump's Deviancy Down:" Trump's secrecy is simply unparalleled in modern presidential politics. Hillary Clinton has released 38 years of tax returns, while the Trump campaign has published zero. (Facing an IRS audit, even Richard Nixon made his returns public precisely because, he said, "people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook.") Unlike Hillary Clinton, we have no idea how much money Donald Trump makes each year or how. We don't know what, if anything, he gives to charity. (The Donald hasn't given any money to his own Trump Foundation since 2008.) Americans don't know what tax rate Trump pays, or if he even pays Uncle Sam taxes at all. He's probably worth much less than the $10 billion he claims. Regardless, as I've documented elsewhere, his tax proposals would doubtless save him millions of dollars annually, and his heirs billions after he goes to the great reality show in the hereafter. But if Donald Trump is keeping his personal finances secret, there's no mystery what his policy proposals will do to the United States Treasury and the American economy. The question isn't whether Trump's plans will do real harm, but how much. Take, for example, Trump's new proposal to provide six weeks of paid maternal leave to workers of the 88 percent of employers who do not currently provide such a benefit. Hillary Clinton's much broader program of family and medical leave carries a 10-year price tag and is funded by tax increases on the wealthy. But as Kevin Drum noted, "The Trump campaign said the cost of his paid-leave policy would be offset by reducing waste and abuse in the unemployment insurance program." And that, Drum explained, "is as clear as mud." As for the cost, well, who knows? But let's take a rough swag. There are about 4 million births per year in the United States. Figure 70 percent of women are in the labor force and 90 percent don't get employer maternity leave. That gets us to 2.5 million women eligible for Trump's program, and on average each will get a total of, oh, let's say $2,000 or so. That comes to $5 billion. And how will it be paid for? By reducing "waste and abuse" in the unemployment insurance program. Again, let's take a rough swag at this. Total benefits in 2016 are projected to come in at $32 billion. Of that, about 10 percent represents overpayments, or $3.2 billion. A vigorous program could probably cut that by half, saving $1.6 billion. Finally, the federal share of UI is roughly 20 percent, so that means the feds would save about $0.3 billion. [Emphasis mine.] If that "waste and abuse" talking point sounds familiar, it should. Just days earlier, Donald Trump used the same sound bite to explain how he'll fund his big boost in funding for the Pentagon. As the Los Angeles Times cautioned last week after Trump's big national security speech, "Trump says he would restore hundreds of billions in military cuts, but it's unclear how he'd pay for it." Which is exactly right. Trump didn't merely call for reversing the 2011 budget "sequester," a move that would add $500 billion in defense spending over the next decade. "Those costs could increase substantially, depending on the size and scope of other promises Trump made Wednesday to expand the U.S. fleet." And how would Trump pay for this big build-up? I will ask Congress to fully offset the costs of increased military spending. In the process, we will make government leaner and more responsive to the public. I will ask that savings be accomplished through common sense reforms that eliminate government waste and budget gimmicks - and that protect hard-earned benefits for Americans. This is the budgetary equivalent of suggesting a magic unicorn will pick up the tab. For example, FactCheck.org found that his projected savings from reducing the federal work force, "improper government payments," and collecting unpaid taxes would at best "still only cover about two-thirds of the total cost of Trump's military spending increases." It's probably much less, in part because Republicans have gutted the IRS budget for five straight years, leading the tax gap between what Americans and their businesses owe and what they pay to grow to as much as $500 billion a year. (As John Koskinen, the IRS Commissioner that House Republicans are currently trying to impeach lamented in 2013, "I have not figured out either philosophically or psychologically why nobody seems to care whether we collect the revenue or not.") So, "there isn't enough unemployment fraud in the United States to come close to paying" for Trump's leave program for wealthy families and there certainly isn't enough waste and abuse in the federal government to fund The Donald's Pentagon spending spree. Or Social Security. The retirement program for 60 million elderly Americans will need a funding increase after 2034. While both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton pledged to provide those funds by raising the payroll tax "cap" on income over $120,000 a year, Trump has promised to leave Social Security benefits untouched by … wait for it … cutting government waste, fraud, and abuse. In an April 2016 ad, the reality TV star turned GOP frontrunner pledged he would "save Social Security and Medicare without cuts." As he put it at a December 11, 2015 rally in Iowa: "So, you've been paying into Social Security and Medicare...but we are not going to cut your Social Security and we're not cutting your Medicare. We are going to take jobs back from all these countries that are ripping us off and we are going to become a wealthy country again. And we are going to be able to save your Social Security. We are not taking it...so there is tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse. What we are going to do is we're going to save Medicare, we're going to save Social Security, we are not going to raise the age, and we're not going to do all the things that everybody else is talking about doing. They are all talking about doing it and you don't have to." [Emphasis mine.] But what the conservative National Review called "Trumpian hyperbole," the libertarian Reason concluded "makes clear that he has no idea what he's talking about." The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated the savings at a comparatively paltry $3 billion a year. And if "Trump's plan to preserve Social Security by eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse doesn't even come close to adding up," his Medicare schemes are more comical still. During the GOP primaries, Trump (like Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie) called for enabling Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Ending that prohibition enshrined in President Bush's 2003 Medicare Part D prescription drug program, Trump boasted, would produce YUGE savings.  "We are not allowed to negotiate drug prices. Can you believe it? We pay about $300 billion more than we are supposed to, than if we negotiated the price. So there's $300 billion on day one we solve." There are only two problems with Trump's claim: currently, that negotiation is illegal. Congressional Republicans are committed to keeping it that way. Second, as the Washington Post helpfully pointed out: Total spending in Medicare Part D (prescription drugs) in 2014 was $78 billion. So Trump, in effect, is claiming to save $300 billion a year on a $78 billion program. That's like turning water into wine. And as Bloomberg noted, total spending on prescription drugs for the entire United States was $298 billion in 2014. Even in the most accommodating scenario, Donald Trump is claiming he can get drugs for all 320 million Americans for free. Donald Trump’s bogus savings from the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. It's no wonder fact-checkers, analysts, reporters and lowly bloggers use terms like "absurd" and "ridiculous" and "comical" and "hallucinatory" to describe Donald Trump's budget alchemy. America's would-be subprime president could actually pay for his government the old-fashioned way: by raising taxes. But with his proposed gigantic tax windfall for the wealthy, Trump has already foreclosed that possibility. And when combined with his protectionist trade policies and draconian immigration crackdown, the certain Trump recession would be the opposite of making America great again. As Reuters reported this week, the analyst firm Oxford Economics forecast that a Trump presidency could cost the U.S. economy $1 trillion. "The consequences could be far-reaching," the assessment concluded of a Trump victory, potentially "undermining the anticipated recovery in global growth:" If Trump were able to implement all of his proposed policies, that would undermine global economic growth and knock 5 percent off where U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) would otherwise be in 2021, U.K.-based economists Jamie Thompson and Sarah Maxwell said in a note Tuesday. That would erase as much as $1 trillion off the forecast size of the U.S. economy in 2021, Thompson said via email. If that dire warning sounds familiar, it should. Back in July, the deficit hawks at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CFRB) offered an analysis showing Trump's massive tax-cut windfall for the wealthy would fuel $11.5 trillion in additional national debt over the next decade. That dire forecast arrived hot on the heels of a study by former John McCain adviser and current Hillary Clinton donor Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics. He found that if all of Trump's proposed policies became reality "the U.S. economy would plunge back into recession, losing millions of jobs." The question isn’t whether President Trump’s policies will cause a recession, but how bad it will be. But as horrifying as the predicted numbers would be under President Trump—a long recession from 2018 through 2020, 3.5 million jobs lost, unemployment catapulting to 7.4 percent, and the U.S. economy shrinking by 2.4 percent—America's future could actually be much worse. That's because there's one other Trump pledge neither analysis took into account. To Bob Woodward on March 31, Trump proclaimed he could eliminate the entire national debt "fairly quickly." Just how how quickly? "Well, I would say over a period of eight years." You read that right. To erase all of Uncle Sam's red ink current and projected by the end of his second term, President Donald Trump would have to slash federal spending by more than 90 percent. (See chart below.) That's not just the budgetary equivalent of causing the sun to rise in the west or switching off gravity on Earth. Trump's ax would trigger a global economic calamity leaving Americans nostalgic for the Great Depression. The 2008 financial meltdown will look like a picnic if President Trump keeps his promises. To try to understand Trump’s budget alchemy, we need to travel back to late 2015.   During the Republican primaries, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center (TPC) estimated the 10-year cost of the Trump tax plan at between $9.5 trillion and $12 trillion. By cutting the top income tax rate from 39.6 to 25 percent, capping the dividend and capital gains rate at 20 percent, and allowing "pass-through" businesses and partnerships to pay only a 15 percent rate, Trump would deliver a huge payday to the top 1 percent of earners. (In August, Trump revised his September 2015 tax plan and its three income tax brackets of 10, 15, and 25 percent to 12, 25, and 33 percent.  The additional revenue is not reflected above.) Businesses, too, would benefit as the statutory corporate tax rate was slashed from 35 to 15 percent. (On top of that, the elimination of the estate tax, paid by less than a quarter of 1 percent of all fortunes, would—on paper at least—redirect billions of Trump's supposed $10 billion wealth from the U.S. Treasury to his heirs.)  At the end of the day, the richest 0.1 percent of households—those bringing in at least $3.7 million a year—would on average pocket another $1.3 million annually. As TPC concluded: These are tectonic shifts in tax policy. Tectonic shifts, too, for Uncle Sam's bottom line. As McClatchy reported: The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which analyzed the plans of all the main presidential candidates, found that Trump's plans would add $11.5 trillion over the next 10 years, causing the debt to rise to 127 percent of the gross domestic product by 2026. The plan of his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, would also increase the national debt, but by less, adding $250 billion to the debt over a decade, bringing it to 87 percent of the GDP by 2026—which closely mirrors current projections. Thanks to President Trump’s tax cuts for the rich, the national debt will be “yuge.” And those current projections show the full extent of the red ink President Trump would have to mop-up over his two terms in office. According to the March 2016 forecast from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the next president will inherit a national debt of roughly $19.3 trillion. Under the current baseline forecast—that is, no changes to today's federal policies—the federal government will run up an additional $6.7 trillion. (As the table at the top shows, spending is projected to exceed tax revenue by $38.9 trillion versus $32.2 trillion.) But on top of that $26 trillion in debt, President The Donald over his eight-year tenure would add yet another $9.2 trillion. (That figure is pro-rated from CRFB's 10 year-forecast.) So to keep his promise, President Trump would have to eliminate $35.2 trillion in debt "over a period of eight years." But to achieve that from spending cuts alone would be impossible in the real world: Trump would have to slash a mind-blowing 91 percent of all federal spending from 2017 through 2024.  Now, there are still two problems with fulfilling Trump's dangerous and contradictory promises for the government's budget, even for the most ardent of the "drown it in a bathtub" crowd. Assuming he could find a magic wand to make $35.3 trillion in spending disappear from a $38.9 trillion, eight-year budget, the U.S. economy would be a devastated hellscape if President Trump got anywhere close. As ThinkProgress pointed out when a balanced budget amendment was being kicked around Congress four years ago, even those comparatively modest cuts would produce an economic calamity on the scale of the Great Depression: If the 2012 budget were balanced through spending cuts, those cuts would total about $1.5 trillion in 2012 alone, the analysis estimates. Those cuts would throw about 15 million more people out of work, double the unemployment rate from 9 percent to approximately 18 percent, and cause the economy to shrink by about 17 percent instead of growing by an expected 2 percent. Where will Trump find trillions in savings? But President Trump would never get that far due to a second problem with his kamikaze cuts. Only about 30 percent of the federal budget is "discretionary," that is, subject to changing congressional appropriations each year. The rest, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the national debt, is mandatory spending previously set into law by Congress and the president. In fiscal year 2016, which ends on September 30, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forecasts that discretionary spending will reach $1.22 trillion, or 31 percent of the $3.9 trillion total. Of those discretionary dollars, defense spending makes up $595 billion, or almost half. Everything else the federal government does—foreign aid, R&D, education, transportation, veterans' services, makes up the rest. So, even if President Trump wanted to commit national economic suicide, he would need Congress to go along and make it happen. Either way, he would have to violate one of his other campaign promises: no cuts to Social Security and Medicare. Now, there are four claims Trump and his water carriers will offer to explain away his utter defeat at the hands of basic math. The first is the latest variation on the old Republican "dynamic scoring" scam. In GOP mythology, the hemorrhaging from the Treasury will magically be cauterized by the extra economic growth incentivized by lower tax rates. But this wouldn’t be just another case (backed up by the past four decades of American history) of failing to produce the massive "macroeconomic feedback" that Paul Ryan, Arthur Laffer, and their ilk have predicted and continue to predict. As CRFB's resident deficit scold Maya MacGuineas summed it up: For Trump, it would take 5.4 percent annual growth to stabilize the debt, and over 10 percent to balance the budget. For some context, we haven't had 5 percent growth since the late 60s and early 70s—and back then we didn't have nearly as many people about to retire and leave the labor force. But as a wide array of analysts across the political spectrum have warned, the United States would not experience explosive—and unprecedented—economic growth under a President Trump. Far from it. Even before his speech outside Pittsburgh this summer, The Washington Post and The New York Times warned of a crippling economic blowback from the trade war that would necessarily ensue from Trump's proposed 35 and 45 percent tariffs on Mexican and Chinese imports, respectively. The analysis prepared by Moody's Analytics found that: They would, in fact, sock it to China and Mexico. Both would fall into recession, the model suggests, if Trump levied his proposed tariffs and those countries retaliated with tariffs of their own. Unfortunately, the United States would fall into recession, too. Up to 4 million American workers would lose their jobs. Another 3 million jobs would not be created that otherwise would have been, had the country not fallen into a trade-induced downturn. For his part, Trump is unconcerned. As with his immigration and tax plans, the golf aficionado is going for a mulligan. During the roll-out of his child care program this week, Trump announced "I will outline my full economic plan, which is completely paid for through economic growth and proposed federal budget savings." Regardless, the real estate hustler insists, the specifics of proposals don't matter anyway: "My voters don't care and the public doesn't care. They know you're going to do a good job once you're there." Ditto, The Donald wrongly claims, for his tax returns. "As far as my taxes are concerned, the only one that cares is the press … I think people don't care." To put it another way, you can fool some of the people all of the time, and that is Donald Trump's target market. Let's just hope that his target market isn't big enough to let Donald Trump mortgage the White House for the next four or (God forbid) eight years. Because when the bills for the subprime president come due, it will be a catastrophe for all of us. 51 Comments Share this article 86 86 86 51 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption It's all about the money, money, money If you thought the fallout from the global Libor rate-rigging scandal was over, think again. Australia's world of high finance and at least a dozen global banks have recently been thrust into the spotlight because of two separate lawsuits. Court filings allege a key Australian interest rate benchmark was manipulated for hundreds of millions of dollars in "illicit" profit between 2010 and 2012. It is partly because of the colourful exchanges between traders over phone, email and instant messenger, all set out in these court filings, that charges have been laid. "You dropping by the casino for Christmas day?" a senior Australian interest rates trader nicknamed "The Rat" allegedly asked another trader in one transcript. "Which casino? BBSW?" he messaged back. BBSW is an acronym for Australia's bank bill swap rate, the local equivalent of Libor. It essentially determines what banks charge to lend to each other. "Lucky the rate sets are all legit and there is no manipulation within the Australian financial system," an ANZ trader wrote in a separate incident. "Ahahah" was the reply, according to court documents. A decade since those messages were sent, it is safe to say their employers - now being sued - definitely aren't laughing. Explaining the Libor saga What is front-running? Forex scandal: How to rig the market Opaque world Australia's "Big Four" banks of National Australia Bank, ANZ, Westpac and Commonwealth Bank of Australia, as well as Macquarie, have found themselves at the centre of the US court battle. As the country's biggest lenders, they played a pivotal role in how the BBSW benchmark was calculated. The methodology was changed in 2013 following the international Libor scandal. The BBSW, which is used to price everything from corporate loans to mortgages, is now based off a collection of live rates from the market. The other defendants in the US class action lawsuit are Citibank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas, Royal Bank of Scotland, UBS, Royal Bank of Canada, Credit Suisse, ICAP and Tullett Prebon. The plaintiffs are hedge funds Sonterra Capital Master Fund, Frontpoint Financial Services (which helped inspire the film The Big Short) and an American derivatives trader dubbed the "Prince of the Pit". Their claim, filed in a New York court, is seeking a jury trial with the intention of recouping millions of dollars lost due to the alleged rate-rigging. All the parties involved in the US litigation have declined to comment or weren't reachable for comment. Image caption Australia's "Big Four" banks have posted years of record profits Much of the US lawsuit is based off what the plaintiffs call "smoking gun evidence" uncovered by Australia's financial watchdog, which had fired the first legal salvo over potential manipulation of the BBSW. Australia's Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) settled claims with UBS, RBS and BNP Paribas over alleged BBSW manipulation in 2013 and 2014. After a long-running investigation, ASIC then launched civil legal proceedings this year against Westpac, National Australia Bank and ANZ for alleged "unconscionable conduct and market manipulation". The three banks have collectively denied the ASIC allegations and said they plan to "vigorously defend" themselves against the charges. Under scrutiny Storm clouds have been brewing around Australia's banks in recent years. They've had a string of high-profile cases hitting the headlines, ranging from allegations that insurance units manipulated reports to class action lawsuits over late fees and toxic workplace environments. Australia's government is now under pressure to launch an inquiry, known as a royal commission, into potential misconduct and malpractice in the financial sector because of the scandals. Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Have Australia's "Big Four" banks lost some of their credit in the eyes of global investors? Dealing a further blow, major ratings agencies have cut their outlook on Australia's banking system to "negative". A credit downgrade could potentially raise their funding costs. Some analysts are also sounding alarm bells, saying that the banks' earnings growth is under pressure from new capital rules, increased competition and rising funding costs. There are also concerns over the impact of Australia's housing bubble, given home loans account for the bulk of local bank assets. Australia has one of the world's highest levels of household debt. Investors need to rethink their love affair with the banks, says Benjamin Pedley, director of investments at UCA Funds Management in Melbourne. "The heady days of banks' performance and their dominance of the local stock market index are already behind us," he told the BBC. "The biggest risk is that they are increasingly domestically focused, having failed in their overseas expansions to the UK and Asia. As the local economy transitions from the mining boom, technological advancements have exposed their business model to weaknesses." Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Australia's housing bubble are making some investors nervous about the country's banks He's not the only market participant to have turned against Australia's largest lenders, which survived the global financial crisis relatively unscathed and are among the world's most profitable. Shorts, or negative bets, against the four banks surged by 50% to more than $6bn (£3.4bn) earlier this year, the highest-ever level, the Wall Street Journal reported. 'Reputational damage' The BBSW rate-rigging scandal hasn't just put Australia's Big Four under scrutiny. It has helped ignite a national debate over the future of Australia's banking landscape. For decades Australia's big banks have controlled more than three-quarters of the market. They hold assets around four times the size of the country's economy. This is largely due to the so-called "Four Pillars" policy introduced by former Australian Treasurer Paul Keating in 1990 (originally "Six Pillars"). It was intended to preserve competition by preventing further consolidation. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Former Australian PM Paul Keating came up with the "Four Pillars" policy when he was Treasurer in 1990 Some believe the policy is now past its use-by date and has instead stifled both competition and innovation. "The four major banks are protected by outdated policy which offers little observable benefit to consumers," said Rob Nicholls, from the Centre for International Finance and Regulation (CIFR) which produced a report into competition in the sector. So can we expect change? Many believe it is too early to say, but Australian banks' largest corporate customers are most concerned with potential instances of misconduct, according to research firm East & Partners. "The majors are clearly acknowledging the seriousness of the allegations as it poses a much larger risk than simply lost revenue from fines and penalties," Martin Smith, head of markets analysis at East & Partners said. "Change is needed immediately given the longer this process runs, the more severe the long-term negative reputational damage will be," Mr Smith said. "Whether the banks are implicated or not, a great deal needs to be done to improve trust and transparency and that can't proceed until the bank bill swap rate and other cases are concluded."

The funding would help the Mumbai-based lender strengthen its balance sheet and cover for bad loans that added upto 7.47 percent of loans until June. "The mandate would cover an advisory on the possible avenues for mobilising part or whole of this amount. At this stage it is not possible to comment on the actual structuring or timing of transactions," the bank was quoted as saying by the agency. In July, shareholders of the bank approved raising about Rs 80 billion via rights issue, preferential stock and institutional share placement method. IDBI stock closed at Rs. 75.45 on Friday, down 1.24 percent from its previous close on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).  The lender reported a 78 percent increase in net profit for the first quarter (Q1) ended June 2016 enabled by a huge tax write-back. If the tax write-back was to be excluded, the bank would have reported a loss of Rs. 935 crore, as against a profit of Rs. 259.45 crore. The bank wrote back a tax provision of Rs. 1,206 crore during the first quarter in comparison to an outgo of Rs. 124 crore for the corresponding period last year, according to the company's regulatory filing to the BSE.

The hottest new plastic is metal Ken Sweet, Associated Press 4:49 p.m. CDT September 17, 2016 The Chase Sapphire Reserve Card has become the hottest credit card on the market after being available only two weeks. It’s in such demand that the manufacturer ran out of the alloy from which it’s made. (Photo: JPMorgan Chase via AP) 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE NEW YORK - The demand has been so overwhelming that the manufacturer ran out of raw material in just a few days. Enthusiasts extol its virtues all over the internet. Millennials are clamoring for it. It’s not a new video game, some fancy food craze or even Apple’s latest iPhone. It’s a credit card. Calling it plastic wouldn’t do it justice. It is a high-end, high-fee, high-reward card made of a metallic alloy that gives it a satisfying heft and an impressive thunk when you toss it onto the table to pick up the check. The Chase Sapphire Reserve Card became the hottest card on the market just two weeks after being introduced, even though it came out during the slow, end-of-summer period, it carries a hefty $450 annual fee, and JPMorgan Chase spent nothing on advertising it. “I’m telling all my friends about it,” said Maddy Novich, 33, of New York, who applied for the card, as did her husband. Like so many crazes these days, this one has been fueled by social media, word-of-mouth and the internet. Frequent travelers and those who try to game travel-loyalty programs have been writing extensively about the card on blogs and forums. “I have never seen such interest in a credit card, and I’ve been doing this for 15 years,” said Gary Leff, who runs the travel and points blog View From the Wing. Chase has approved tens of thousands of applications for the card, said spokeswoman Lauren Francis. Most of the customers are millennials, who typically shun credit cards and are not usually a target for high-fee, ultra-premium plastic. The demand has been so high that Chase ran out of the alloy, whose composition is a trade secret. Customers are being issued temporary plastic cards. “We quickly ordered more, but because they are handcrafted, they take more time to make,” said Lisa Walker, general manager of Chase’s Sapphire credit card program. Credit cards with high fees but generous rewards are aimed at well-to-do customers who spend and travel extensively. The market has long been dominated by American Express with its Platinum Card. So why is the Chase card so hot? Chase offers a 100,000-point sign-up bonus if the customer meets certain spending targets. Those points can be worth up to $1,500 in travel rewards. They can also be converted to hotel or airline points that could secure, oh, a dreamy hotel suite in the Maldives or a first-class ticket for, say, a honeymoon. The card also comes with a $300 annual credit toward travel, which effectively makes the annual fee really $150. It has a generous points-earning program, with triple points on travel and dining, and gives access to airport lounges. “It’s one of the best offers I’ve ever seen. With the amount of travel and dining we do, I saw it as a worthwhile card to get,” Novich said. The card’s metal composition is also clearly part of the appeal. Only a handful of other credit cards are metal, including the American Express Centurion Card, commonly known as the AmEx “black card,” which is typically available only to millionaires, billionaires and celebrities. Kayla Kania, a 33-year-old manager at an accounting firm from Rockville, Maryland, proudly posted a picture of her new Chase card on Instagram and said she has received compliments about it from cashiers and a co-worker. “The metal part of it, people get excited about it. It’s weird,” she said. “It’s such a conversation piece.” 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://post.cr/2d9d59a

IIIT) back in October of 2014, 12 starts ago. Last time out she was third behind Dacita in a blanket finish in the Diana Stakes (gr. IT) at Saratoga Race Course, and missed the win by just a head. "Last time they were only separated by a head, and today again they were a head apart, so they're pretty much two fillies on the same level," said jockey Julien Leparoux, who landed his first graded stakes score since injuring his wrist in a mishap at Saratoga in August. He returned to riding Sept. 8 and later on the Sept. 17 card rode champion Tepin to victory in the Ricoh Woodbine Mile (Can-IT). Dacita closed up the rail well from a tracking position near the back of the pack on turf rated "good "on a rainy day at Woodbine, after 11-1 shot Midnight Miley galloped away to set early fractions of :23.85 and ;46.42. But the even-money favorite just missed getting to the 9-2 winner, who tracked second all the way around before making her move off the turn. "She didn't mind it either way; they went fast and she ran good," Leparoux said. "She didn't mind the little softer ground." Irad Ortiz Jr., who was looking for his third straight win aboard Dacita, offered no excuses for the defeat. "I had a good trip; we just got beat. She had a good kick; she ran good. She liked the turf. But, we got beat by a good filly," he said. The final time for the race, about 1 1/8 miles, was 1:45.42. Faufiler completed the trifecta, followed by Strut the Course, Steip Amach, Midnight Miley, and Goodyearforroses.  Rainha Da Bateria was bred in Kentucky by Alexander Groves Matz out of the Dixieland Band mare Amelia, and sold for $435,000 to Borges Torrealba Holdings from the Gainesway consignment to the 2013 Keeneland September yearling sale. She is a half sister to grade I stakes-placed He's Had Enough. The Canadian victory improved her record to 3-4-2 from 16 starts. Rainha da Bateria not only pulled the $180,000 share of the $303,000 purse to extend her career earnings to $520,060, but also earned a fees-paid berth to the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf (gr. IT) at Santa Anita Park as part of the Breeders' Cup Challenge "Win and You're In" program.

 10 things you need to know today Jonathan Garber Sep. 14, 2016, 6:47 AM 3,698 facebook linkedin twitter email print A dance group performing on the cliffs in Zhangjiajie, in China's Hunan province. Reuters/China Daily China Daily Information Corp - CDIC Here is what you need to know. Something very unusual happened in the markets. The S&P 500 index has fallen by over 1% while yields on the benchmark US 10-year note have risen by 3% from its previous closing level (not nominal terms). This is something that has happened only 36 times dating back to 1962, according to analysis from sentimenTrader. UK jobless claims unexpectedly rose. Data from the Office for National Statistics showed 2,400 people claimed jobless benefits in July, above the 1,800 claims that economists had anticipated. The British pound is little changed near 1.3195 against the dollar. India's wholesale price index hit a 2-year high. Producer prices rose 3.74% year-over-year in August but missed the 4.01% print that economists had forecast. The Indian rupee is stronger by 0.1% at 66.8900 per dollar. Monsanto's board likes Bayer's offer. The deal is worth about $66 billion, or $128 a share, according to multiple reports. JPMorgan is now the biggest bank in the world by assets. Shares of Wells Fargo slid 3.3% on Tuesday to close at $46.96 a share, giving the company a market capitalization of $236.9 billion, compared with JPMorgan's $240.3 billion, Bloomberg reports. Carl Icahn wants to own half of Herbalife. The activist investor says that he is asking the Federal Trade Commission for permission to increase his Herbalife stake to 50% from 35% and that the company would be better off going private. Hank Greenberg's trial has begun. Opening arguments began Tuesday in the trial of former AIG head Hank Greenberg. According to Reuters, Greenberg faces "civil charges from the New York attorney general's office of orchestrating a $500 million transaction to inflate the insurer's reserves and a $200 million transaction to hide underwriting losses." Investors are skeptical of the world's oldest bank's plan to raise cash. Monte dei Paschi di Siena needs to raise up to 5 billion euros ($5.6 billion) to remain afloat and stave off a default that could have wide-ranging implications in Europe, but investors are skeptical to back the bank's third recapitalization in three years, Reuters reports. Stock markets around the world are mixed. China's Shanghai Composite (-0.7%) and Japan's Nikkei (-0.7%) led the losses in Asia, while Britain's FTSE (+0.7%) paces the gains in Europe. S&P 500 futures are up 3.00 points at 2,125.25. US economic data is light. The Department of Energy's oil inventory data will be released at 10:30 a.m. ET. The US 10-year yield is down 1 basis point at 1.72%. Follow 10 Things Before the Opening Bell and never miss an update! Get updates in your Facebook news feed. Get updates in your inbox.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, Sep 18, 2016 - Page 14　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp US stocks fall on Deutsche Bank risk MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES:A potential US$14 billion fine by the Department of Justice sent financial stocks reeling, while Apple led the drop in technology stocks Reuters Performers with the Gombey Evolution Troupe sit in the Goldman Sachs booth during the initial public offering of the Bank of N.T. Butterfield & Son Ltd on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York on Friday. Photo: Bloomberg US stocks fell on Friday as the possibility of a US$14 billion fine against Deutsche Bank weighed on big banks and investors wrestled with lingering uncertainty about when the US Federal Reserve would hike interest rates. The settlement proposal, made during negotiations between the US Department of Justice and Deutsche Bank over claims that the German bank missold mortgage-backed securities, was larger than expected. Deutsche Bank’s US-listed shares slumped 9.35 percent. Dow components Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan fell by more than 1 percent each. The S&P 500 financial index dropped 0.91 percent, dragging down the benchmark index the most. The KBW Bank index fell 1.11 percent and logged its second straight week of declines. Traders have all but ruled out the possibility of the Fed raising interest rates at its meeting, which starts on Tuesday. However, residual doubts and questions about when the Fed might finally pull the trigger still hurt sentiment. “It’s the uncertainty of next week, the complacency of investors trying to re-evaluate their portfolios as we prepare for an interest-rate hike,” said Jeff Carbone, cofounder of Cornerstone Financial Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.49 percent to finish at 18,123.80 points and the S&P 500 fell 0.38 percent to 2,139.16. The NASDAQ Composite fell 0.1 percent to 5,244.57. With futures and options contracts expiring, about 9.3 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges, above the 6.6 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. For the week, the Dow edged up 0.2 percent, the S&P gained 0.5 percent and the NASDAQ jumped 2.3 percent. The technology index on Friday dropped 0.33 percent, pulled down by Apple’s 0.56 percent decline and Oracle’s 4.75 percent drop following weak quarterly profit. Helping limit losses was Intel’s 3.04 percent gain to a 15-year high after the chipmaker raised its third-quarter revenue forecast. The CBOE Market Volatility index, Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” declined 5.7 percent. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.79-to-1 ratio; on NASDAQ, a 1.18-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 5 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the NASDAQ Composite recorded 88 new highs and 50 new lows. This story has been viewed 1450 times. Comments will be moderated.
