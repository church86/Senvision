London : JPMorgan retained its place at the top of the global investment bank rankings in the first half of this year despite a fall in revenues, while Deutsche Bank's troubles ensured the top five were all U.S banks, new data on Friday showed. JPMorgan's revenue from trading, mergers and acquisitions and other investment banking activity was $12.5 billion in the six months to June, down 5.3 per cent from the same period a year ago, according to data compiled by industry analytics firm Coalition. Deutsche has warned it may need deeper cost cuts to turn itself around after revenue fell sharply in the second quarter due to challenging markets and low interest rates. It fell to sixth place from third, allowing Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) to move up into the top five. Investment banks suffered their worst first half year performance since the 2008 financial crisis as revenues for the top 12 players fell 15 per cent from the same period a year ago, the data showed. Looming U.S elections, Britain's vote to leave the European Union in June, near-zero interest rates and worries about China's economy have spooked markets this year and curbed investors' appetite to take risks. Last week, Citigroup (C.N) said it expects to post better results in fixed income trading for the third quarter compared with a year ago. Most of JPMorgan's revenue, some $6.9 billion, was accrued on its home turf but the $3.9 billion generated in its Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) operations was enough to dislodge Deutsche from the top place in that region. In the same period last year, Deutsche was number one in EMEA with revenue of $4.3 billion. Its slide to number two, even on its home turf highlights how difficult a year it has been for Germany's biggest lender. JPMorgan also dislodged Deutsche Bank in the Asia Pacific (APAC region) to take top spot with revenue of $1.7 billion in the first half of the year. That was 15 per cent lower than the $2 billion Deutsche Bank earned in the same period last year in the region. JPMorgan retained its crown in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) trading, its position solidified by its dominance in G10 rates and foreign exchange trading. The U.S bank slipped a place to third in the equities ranking, however. Coalition tracks Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Societe Generale and UBS.

The New York-based firm made the most money from raw materials among the top 12 investment banks after coming top in the past two years, according to Coalition Development Ltd., a London-based business analytics company. JPMorgan Chase & Co. came second and Citigroup Inc. dropped to third, Coalition said in a report Friday. Revenue at the 12 banks fell by a quarter to $2.2 billion from a year earlier on weak performances in energy and industrial metals, it said earlier this month. That was the worst first half in at least a decade, Coalition estimated. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and BNP Paribas SA came next in the ranking, followed by UBS Group AG, HSBC Holdings Plc and Societe Generale SA, it said. Coalition tracks commodities activities including power and gas, oil, metals, coal and agriculture. Several banks in the ranking have scaled back or abandoned commodities businesses amid increased regulatory scrutiny. The analysis doesn’t include Australian, Canadian or emerging-market banks that have a large presence in commodities. It does include Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, and Barclays Plc.

Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf is going to have to leave his gig, it's just a matter of when. Sen. Elizabeth Warren lambasted Stumpf on Wednesday, calling for his resignation during his Capitol Hill appearance, but along with those calls for him to quit is a simple reality: He's likely out in 2018, no matter what. That year, he turns 65, and under company rules that is when senior executives usually leave the bank, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. So one way or another, Wells Fargo will likely be kicking off the hunt for a new CEO at some point in the next 12 months. When that search begins is likely to be influenced in part by Capitol Hill, but also by shareholders in the bank. One prominent analyst has an idea about who, or at least from where, Wells Fargo's next CEO could come. "JPMorgan Chase has been a proving ground for CEOs all over the country," said Rafferty Capital banking analyst Dick Bove. Specifically, Bove suggested that JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank CEO Daniel Pinto or consumer and community banking CEO Gordon Smith could take the lead role at Wells Fargo when Stumpf either retires or resigns. Wells Fargo and JPMorgan declined to comment when contacted by CNBC. Bove said he still believes Stumpf will make it to retirement, but acknowledged: "His performance" before the Senate Banking Committee this week "was abysmal." If Stumpf resigns, it would create a void within Wells Fargo that likely would not be filled by a current Wells Fargo executive, another industry source suggested to CNBC. Timothy Sloan, a Wells Fargo banker who was promoted from the CFO role to president and COO, was once considered a likely candidate to replace Stumpf. But the industry source suggested that because of the tarnish on the bank's brand in the wake of its unauthorized accounts scandal, it would be difficult to promote an insider to the CEO role now. Bove suggested that if the bank decides to replace Stumpf sooner rather than later, it may try to bring back the popular former CEO Richard Kovacevich as temporary chairman until a permanent CEO is found. Kovacevich is 72.

Sought is judgment in the amount of $117,028.84, plus interest, attorney’s fees and costs. Judgments recorded The Campton Funeral Home, 525 Delaware Ave., Palmerton, has placed on record a judgment entered in its favor by Magisterial District Justice William Kissner of Palmerton. The judgment is against Shannon W. Reeser, 48 E. Water St., Lansford, in the amount of $7,567.03, stemming from breach of contract regarding funeral services rendered by the business. Capital One Bank, Glen Allen, Virginia, has filed judgments against two individuals that were ordered by magisterial district justices. One judgment is against Ida L. Mefford, 2015 Penn Forest Trail, Albrightsville. It was entered on Sept. 20, 2011, by Magisterial District Judge Edward M. Lewis of Jim Thorpe in the amount of $1,972.50. The second judgment is against Pearl Sittler, 1720 Stagecoach Road West, Palmerton. It was entered on Sept. 21, 2011, by Magisterial District Judge William Kissner of Palmerton in the amount of $1,819.17. Credit default A credit account default suit has been filed by Velocity Investments LLC, Wall, New Jersey, against Maryann Hartman, 323 E. Fell St., second floor, Summit Hill. The suit contends Velocity purchased the Lending Club Corporation account in which the defendant is in default. Judgment in the amount of $18,040.77, plus the cost of the suit, is sought. Zoning violation Towamensing Township, 120 Stable Road, Lehighton, has filed a judgment entered in its possession by Magisterial District Judge William Kissner of Palmerton against Matthew Higgins Jr., 100 Twin Flower Circle, Kunkletown. The judgment was ordered on Nov. 30, 2015, in the amount of $12,000, plus filing fees of $162.50. An accompanying document in the filing states Higgins is the owner of a property at the above address, which is situated in a residential zoning district. The pleading states the defendant installed an accessory structure on the property without applying for and obtaining a zoning permit, the action being in violation of the township’s regulations concerning minimum yard requirements. The plaintiff claims the defendant failed to appeal an enforcement notice sent to him by the township’s zoning hearing board, and has been in violation of a former ordinance of the township from Oct. 25, 2014, until March 16, 2015, and a new but similar one enacted on March 16, 2015. Complaint in replevin A complaint in replevin has been filed by William R. Kirchgessner, Carlstadt, New Jersey, against Michael G. Heitczman, 433 Third St., Weatherly. The plaintiff alleges he extended a loan in the amount of $27,575.25 to the defendant on Sept. 23, 2012, in order for him to purchase a 2007 Chevrolet, at which time the defendant granted to the plaintiff the first lien on the vehicle. The suit states that as of July 20, 2016, the defendant has made payments in the amount of $17,594.11, but is in default of the balance of $10,633.10. Kirchgessner is seeking judgment against the defendant for possession of the vehicle or, in the alternative, for damages of $10,633.10, plus interest. Ejectment complaint U.S. Bank N.A., Salt Lake City, Utah, has filed a complaint in ejectment against Mike Smith and occupants, 72 Hi Arc Lane, Ashfield. The complaint states the plaintiff became owner of a property at the above address through a mortgage foreclosure and sheriff’s sale case in which Smith was the previous owner. Despite becoming the property owner, the suit states the defendant(s) are in possession of the property without title. The bank is seeking judgment in ejectment for immediate possession of the premises and asks the court to order issuance of an immediate writ of possession.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Sep 23, 2016 at 1:20PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. What are the biggest banks in America? That depends on what you mean by "big." The traditional way to measure a bank's size is by its balance sheet -- that is, the cumulative value of its assets. But the flaw in this approach is that it doesn't actually reflect what a bank is worth. Banks are highly leveraged institutions, typically holding $10 worth of assets for every $1 dollar in capital. The latter, not the former, more closely approximates a bank's net worth. Given this, another way to measure a bank's size is by looking at its shareholders' equity, or book value. But this too has shortcomings, as most banks don't trade for book value. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C), for example, are currently priced at 35% discounts to their book values. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), meanwhile, trade for 29% and 7% premiums, respectively, to their book values. So, how do you reconcile the fact that a bank's book value only roughly approximates its actual value? The answer is to look at its market capitalization. What is this, you ask? According to The Motley Fool's knowledge center: Market capitalization is one of the best measures of a company's size. Also known as market cap, market capitalization is the total market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. For example, you may have heard Apple referred to as "the most valuable company in the world." That's because Apple currently has the highest market cap of any publicly traded company. A company's market cap is thus derived by taking its shareholders' equity and then multiplying that by the premium or discount to book value that its shares currently trade at. With this in mind, here are the nation's 10 biggest banks by market cap: Bank Market Capitalization (millions) JPMorgan Chase $241,461 Wells Fargo $231,187 Bank of America $159,909 Citigroup $136,407 U.S. Bancorp $74,007 PNC Financial $44,600 Bank of New York Mellon $43,257 Capital One Financial $36,286 BB&T $31,171 State Street $27,711 Data source: YCharts.com. As you can see, there's a clear difference between the four biggest banks in the country -- the "too big to fail" banks -- and the rest. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have market caps above $200 billion, while Bank of America and Citigroup are the only other two that eclipse $100 billion. It's also worth noting that these figures fluctuate in line with a bank's stock price. To this end, for the last few years, Wells Fargo was actually the biggest bank by market cap, despite the fact that its balance sheet is roughly a third smaller than JPMorgan Chase's. After Wells Fargo's recent troubles, however, it's fallen back to second place. And while Bank of America and Citigroup lag far behind their bigger (by market cap) peers, the gap will undoubtedly narrow as their profits continue to improve from where they were eight years ago at the nadir of the financial crisis. In short, while measuring the size of a bank by its market cap is only one way to do so, it's an important concept for investors to know.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 23, 2016 1:46pm   Comments Share: Related FIW A Surprise Among Utilities ETFs Cool Off With A New Water ETF Related A REIT ETF With A Whopping Yield Stephen Parker, head of JPMorgan's Thematic Equity Solutions, told CNBC on Friday that investors shouldn't be chasing yield in non-traditional asset classes. Parker said investors have been "pilling in" to asset classes, which are perceived to be "safe havens." These include minimum volatility ETFs that offer exposure to utilities, consumer staples and other sectors that offer a "more attractive yield." Related Link: A Surprise Among Utilities ETFs However, sectors such as utilities are no longer trading at a discount; rather, they are trading at a premium to the market. "When you think about safety, safety is a reflection not just of the fundamentals but also of the price you are paying," he expanded. "We are telling clients to be cautious about chasing yields at this point." Despite his cautious tone, he added that one of the "really positive" themes of the market year-to-date is that many of these safe sectors have outperformed the broader market. However, investors are indeed becoming "nervous" about the current price to buy these supposed safe haven investments. Parker continued that in order for stocks to continue moving forward there needs to be better earnings and economic growth along with a higher inflation rate. His personal expectation is for growth to be "modest" and overall "positive." Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

 Walmart forges processing partnership with Chase BI Intelligence Sep. 23, 2016, 12:43 PM 1,524 facebook linkedin twitter email print This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. BII See Also American Express has linked up with Global Payments Chase has debuted a new card aimed at small businesses Green Dot is looking to a younger audience JPMorgan Chase announced that it will begin processing Chase Visa payments made at US Walmart and Sam’s Club stores, along with Sam's Club's website, through ChaseNet, the bank’s closed-loop processing network for Chase Visa cards. The partnership marks an expansion of the relationship between ChaseNet and Walmart, which was previously confined to Walmart e-commerce processing.  It’s probable that Chase Visa cards comprise a significant share of Walmart’s overall card payments. Eighty percent of US consumers prefer debit or credit cards for both in-person and online payments, according to TransFirst, which means it’s likely that a considerable amount of Walmart’s purchasing comes from payment cards. Because Chase, which issues predominantly Visa cards, is the largest US bank by assets, it’s likely that it’s the issuer of a decent share of cards used for spending at Walmart. As such, it’s likely the number of payments the partnership will cover is not insubstantial.  That makes the expansion of the partnership a major opportunity for ChaseNet. ChaseNet was already processing Walmart e-commerce payments. Last year, Walmart’s digital sales totaled $14 billion, according to Fortune. And that’s a segment that’s growing — global online sales grew nearly 12% year-over-year (YoY) in Q2 2016. But the expanded partnership gives them much more access. Walmart’s shopper traffic in-store is also growing, according to Fortune, which means ChaseNet will also get access to this population. In addition, adding Sam’s Club’s online business, which grew by46% in Q4 2015, gives ChaseNet access to another large and fast-growing revenue stream.   And it could also help lower interchange payments for Walmart, which has been a sticking point for the retailer in recent months. Walmart pays a considerable amount in card fees annually. And earlier in 2016, the retailer sued Visa over its fee structure. But for its partners, ChaseNet provides fixed-rate and often discounted interchange pricing on eligible cards, which means that Walmart would pay considerably less on any purchase made via a Chase Visa card, thereby decreasing fees on a number of purchases. That could help relieve tensions between Walmart and Visa in other areas by making fees across the board more affordable. Evan Bakker, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on payments gateways that explains what they do, the benchmarks on which they compete, their growth drivers, and the key players. It also assesses the potential for gateways to impact legacy processors.  Here are some key takeaways from the report: Payment gateways help e-commerce merchants accept online transactions. They serve as the online version of a payment terminal and front-end processor for online and mobile sellers. Gateways typically sell bundled services, including payment acceptance, data reporting, and fraud management. Gateways have an opportunity to capitalize on the growing online processing market. BI Intelligence estimates that the US online processing market — from which gateways extract some of their revenue — will be worth about $10.7 billion this year. The market will grow to $17.5 billion by 2020, driven by the increase in online shopping. As online sales rise, gateways' addressable audience — e-commerce merchants — is getting both larger and more valuable, affording gateways an opportunity to seize and compete for more potential revenue. Gateways pose threats to the old guard as more merchants embrace the online-to-offline (O2O) business model. Many of the most successful tech companies, like Uber and Airbnb, leverage an O2O model, in which customers pay for in-person goods and services digitally. With an early-mover advantage among these types of retailers, gateways might begin to displace revenue from legacy processors because they will substitute rather than complement in-store processing volume. In full, the report: Explains how gateways function and compete with each other in the payments ecosystem. Identifies the factors enabling gateways to capture long-term growth. Forecasts the size of the online and in-store processing markets to give context on the industry gateways operate within. Lists the key gateway providers and explains what makes each successful. Assesses the disruption opportunity for gateways and how this will affect legacy processors. Interested in getting the full report?

The initial public offering could raise $5 billion, Thomson Reuters publication IFR reported previously . CITIC Securities , Citigroup, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have started preparatory work, although no formal mandate has been awarded, the people said. The timing and size of the IPO are still undetermined, but the four banks are likely to land the key sponsor roles for the deal, they said, declining to be identified as the information has not been officially disclosed. Lufax, valued at $18.5 billion in a January fundraising, would be the first peer-to-peer (P2P) platform to list in Hong Kong. The IPO comes at a time of surging growth in P2P lending and will test investor appetite for a new breed of companies that threaten to disrupt the traditional financial industry. Lufax and Ping An declined to comment. CITIC CLSA, the Hong Kong investment banking unit of CITIC Securities, Citigroup and JPMorgan also declined to comment. Morgan Stanley did not offer an immediate response. Peer-to-peer platforms help link up individual or institutional investors looking to invest their cash with borrowers including small- and medium-enterprises, students and other individuals that need funding. Those companies are part of a booming financial technology (fintech) industry in China that hopes to offer a young and increasingly affluent population speedy and easy-to-use services on their mobile phones. The volume of Chinese P2P loans stood at 680.3 billion yuan ($102 billion) at the end of August, more than 20 times levels seen in January 2014, according to industry data provider Wangdaizhijia. That could swell to 880 billion yuan by the end of 2016 and to 1.5 trillion yuan by the end of 2018, according to estimates from Nomura. But P2P lending has also drawn much scrutiny from regulators. Seeking to head off rising risks in the market, Chinese authorities implemented aggressive steps including requiring borrowing limits and the use of third-party banks as custodians of investor funds in P2P platforms. The measures will probably leave China with 200-300 P2P players by this time next year from more than 4,000 now, Lufax CFO James Zheng said in late August. Lufax had over 23.3 million users at end-June, Ping An said in its first-half earnings report, more than double a year earlier. Trading volumes totalled 3.2 trillion yuan ($480 billion) over the same period, compared with 512 million yuan in the first half of 2015.

Embed from Getty Images   It isn’t easy quitting a lucrative job at JPMorgan to become a middle-aged college freshman. Bloomberg News reports that David Lim mulled the idea for seven years before he finally left the bank’s South Korea unit in February, heading back to school to start a new career as a physical therapist. For the 43-year-old father of one, the country’s shrinking financial industry and booming health-care sector made the decision to pursue his passion a little less daunting. “Because Korea is aging fast, people are growing more and more health conscious,” said Lim, who left his role in banking sales at JPMorgan to join the health sciences program at the University of Otago in New Zealand. After graduation, he plans to eventually start his own business in Korea. Lim is among a growing number of bankers turning to stronger segments of Korea’s job market as the nation’s financial industry grapples with weak profitability, tepid economic growth and rising corporate defaults. Financial-sector employment shrank by 3.3% in the year through October 2015, versus gains of at least 1.9% over similar periods in Hong Kong, New York and the U.K. To access the complete Bloomberg News article hit the link below: Back to School for 43-year-old JPMorgan Banker as Koreans Flee Finance Divided Fed Holds Fire, Signals 2016 Rate Increase Still Likely And the Best Place to Work in the global financial markets 2016 is...

Embed from Getty Images   Bloomberg News reports that the Fed is seeking a fine of as much as $62m from the bank, and the OCC is also seeking punishments to settle claims that a breakdown in controls resulted in JPMorgan inappropriately hiring the children of Chinese officials to win business, the people said, asking not to be identified because the talks are private. Those probes would come on top of settlements being negotiated with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors. At issue is whether the bank’s hiring of relatives of influential Chinese officials was tantamount to paying a bribe that ran afoul of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The 1977 law made it illegal to provide pay or benefits to a foreign government official. JPMorgan is expected to settle later this year with the U.S. Justice Department and SEC to end the three-year probe. The bank could pay about $200m to resolve the investigations, people familiar with the matter have said. While the Justice Department’s examination initially focused on JPMorgan, it widened to include other Wall Street firms, according to the people.

Angela Merkel appears to be throwing a wrench in the works of Deutsche Bank's (DB)  plans to reduce a $14 billion penalty recently levied by the U.S. Justice Department, and this has sent the bank's shares to a record low in European trading on Monday. According to a report in Focus magazine, the German chancellor has no plans of aiding the German lender with its DoJ fine, which is tied to Deutsche Bank's role in issuing, distributing and securitizing residential mortgage-backed securities between 2005 and 2007. Merkel has also reportedly ruled out any German government assistance to Deutsche Bank ahead of next year's national elections. Shares of Deutsche Bank ended the day down about 7% in European trading and its New-York listed shares were down by almost 7% in mid-morning trading. "At no point has [Deutsche Bank CEO] John Cryan asked Chancellor Merkel to intervene in the RMBS issue with the US Department of Justice," a Deutsche Bank spokesperson said in a phone interview with Real Money. Investors are afraid the bank might have to raise fresh capital to cope with the financial demands that are made on it. Deutsche Bank representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The bank's hopes of substantially winding down the the $14 billion civil charges already seemed to be slight, given the German bank's out sized role in the never-ending "Big Short" saga relative to some of its banking peers. The DoJ did not comment when asked by Real Money for details about the amount and has not yet put out a statement, so investors have to rely only on what information is publicly available on the issue.  In repudiating the DoJ's hefty penalty, the struggling German bank said last week that it has "no intent" to pay "anywhere near" the proposed figure for its role in kindling the pre-crisis residential-mortgage market. But a history of similar settlements suggests forming a convincing counteroffer will be difficult. Deutsche Bank insiders quoted by The Financial Times have said the bank hopes it will be treated like Goldman Sachs (GS) , which ended up paying only about $5 billion, a slap on the wrist vs. the $16.6 billion and $13 billion that Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan (JPM) were forced to shell out, respectively. (Citigroup (C) and Morgan Stanley (MS) also arrived at comparatively small settlements, of $7 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.)  The $14 billion punch could sure be crippling for Deutsche Bank shareholders, who've already seen almost half of the struggling bank's market cap vanish so far in 2016. After all, Deutsche Bank has put aside for litigation reserves only about 5.5 billion euros, or $6.1 billion, analysts with Toronto-based rating agency DBRS recently estimated. And the bank's total market cap is currently around just about $18 billion. And any attempt to get Goldman-like treatment could be tricky. In the pre-crisis housing market, Deutsche Bank appears to have been printing far more collateralized debt obligations. Deutsche created about $42.5 billion worth of the debt packages vs. about $25 billion by Goldman in 2007 alone, according to a 2010 Wall Street Journal report, which cited data compiled by Thomson Reuters. (Meanwhile, according to the report, Bank of America and JPMorgan issued about $65.5 billion and $44.3 billion in CDOs, respectively, over the period.) CDOs are bundles of asset-backed securities, in this case by residential mortgages. Originally designed to spread and reduce risk, instead they contributed to the financial crisis because investors were unable to assess the underlying assets when the housing market turned downward. The fact that Deutsche Bank issued more of them than Goldman in the year when the credit crunch started seems to suggest a deeper role for the German bank. Deutsche Bank representatives contacted by Real Money did not comment.  One of the striking similarities between the two banks is that they appear to have both allowed hedge fund billionaire John Paulson to bet against the housing market while promoting the market to clients. However, the Journal noted "a key difference" in their report: "Goldman told investors that the assets were picked by an independent third party; Deutsche didn't use a third party or give its investors any assurances." Both Goldman and Deutsche Bank were also market-makers for traders interested in shorting the housing market more broadly, as they acted in that capacity through the ABX credit-default index that was dramatized in both Michael Lewis's book The Big Short as well as the eponymous 2015 film, in which Ryan Gosling starred as a character based on the Deutsche Bank banker Greg Lippman, who helped establish the index. Other major investment banks that helped create the ABX index included Bank of America, Barclays (BCS) and Credit Suisse (CS) , among others. Another hurdle could be that Deutsche Bank is already under U.S. scrutiny, after having failed Federal Reserve stress tests, along with Santander (SAN) , in June, in which the central bank objected to "capital plans" because of "broad and substantial weaknesses across their capital planning processes, and insufficient progress these firms have made toward correcting those weaknesses."

Unexpected Champion of Public Clouds: JPMorgan CIO Dana Deasy By Penny Crosman September 22, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints "We aren't looking to decrease the amount of money the firm is spending on technology," says Dana Deasy at JPMorgan Chase. "We're looking to change the mix between run-the-bank costs versus innovation investment." Related Agile Development Is Reshaping Tech at Banks Like Chase and BBVA Why Tech-Savvy Banks Are Gung Ho About 'Container' Software Why Banks Are Finally Embracing Cloud Computing Banks Pushed Toward Cloud Computing By Cost Pressures Is It Almost Time to Put Core Processing in the Cloud? How Mobile Banking Is Raising Its Game Customer Experience Is the Tie that Binds Banks and Fintech 'More Sophisticated': Evolution of the Bank-Fintech Dialogue JPMorgan Chase's chief information officer, Dana Deasy, is making public cloud computing a significant part of the bank's IT strategy, a leap most U.S. banks have been too squeamish to take. By the second half of 2017, the bank plans to run proprietary applications on the public cloud. At the same time, it's building a new, modern internal cloud, code-named Gaia. The bank is so bullish on the use of internal and public cloud computing that in August it hired Harish Grama from IBM to be its CIO of cloud services. "We think we're the very first, at least in financial services, to do this," Deasy said in a recent interview. "The reason is simple: we're serious. Getting our CIO for the cloud in right now is the perfect timing — we're answering such questions as what use cases will be best for the public cloud, what would be best for our private cloud, how do we optimize the skillset of our developers for the public cloud, what's the right pace to do that?" Few large U.S. banks have publicly acknowledged such a firm commitment to using public cloud computing for anything other than common office applications like Salesforce. Largely due to regulatory, risk and security concerns, most have tiptoed around the public cloud, saying only that they do application testing in the public cloud and that they have a few cloud pilots. Cloud computing dramatically changes the IT organization and the way technology people work, Deasy noted. That's why JPMorgan recruited Grama. "We wanted a seasoned professional who's been there, done that, and knows what it takes to optimally leverage public and private cloud from the pure technical architecture and what works and what doesn't work," Deasy said. "And we wanted somebody who knew how to think through changing your workforce." Like most large U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase has had some version of a private cloud for years, with virtualized servers, storage and networks that can be shared in a flexible way throughout the organization. The bank is upgrading its private cloud to "platform as a service" — in other words, the cloud service will manage the infrastructure (servers, storage, and networks), so that developers don't have to worry about that stuff. (They do have to make their applications "cloud aware," so that they can monitor themselves and obtain more resources as needed.) This should improve elasticity — that is, the ability to quickly scale up and down as needs change. In JPMorgan's existing private cloud, "the infrastructure teams work with our developers to identify peak volume through the year," said Larry Feinsmith, the bank's head of global technology strategy, innovation and partnerships. The developers ask for a certain amount of computing and storage resources to meet peak demand. So although virtualized servers save the bank money, it still has to maintain enough servers to handle peak volumes for every application. In the latest generation of private and public cloud computing technology — some of which use OpenStack protocols to control pools of compute, storage, and networking resources managed through a dashboard or API — "you no longer have to deploy for peak," Feinsmith said. "You have to deploy for steady state and then it will scale up or down when you have peaks." Internal resources are shared across the entire organization, regardless of application. Public cloud resources, of course, are virtually inexhaustible. And instead of needing people to watch applications and provide more horsepower or storage when needed, the applications manage their own resources and obtain what they need automatically. The new environment should save time for application developers, Deasy said. "We're spending a lot of time and energy thinking about how to help our application developers be even more efficient," he said. "What does the next-generation application development environment look like? What are the tools? What are the ways they're going to develop?" The bank has 43,000 employees in IT; almost 19,000 are developers. "If we could get back just one hour a day of productivity per developer, you can see how many years of productivity we could gain back," Deasy said. "Which is why we have a big initiative around what we're calling next-generation software modernization." Agile development — the process of developing software in quick iterations rather than bigger, longer-term projects — is also part of the picture. Deasy, a former CIO at General Motors, Tyco and Siemens, wants to make software development run more like a manufacturing plant. "The more you can automate and take friction out of the system from the time you start writing code to the time you're supporting it in production, our developers can spend more time innovating — which is what they prefer to be doing anyway," he said. The use of public cloud computing services will help the bank direct its technology investments more wisely, Deasy maintains. « 1  |  2 »     view entire article Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints JOIN THE DISCUSSION Comment SEE MORE IN Bank Technology RELATED TAGS Comments (0) Be the first to comment on this post using the section below.

Apollo Global Management LLC, Wilton Re Holdings Ltd., Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and JC Flowers & Co. are among potential bidders who have expressed interest, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private. Talcott could fetch $3 billion to $4 billion in a sale, they said. Talcott includes so-called runoff coverage, or segments where Hartford is no longer writing new contracts, and had about $4.7 billion of statutory capital at the end of June, according to financial statements. Hartford has been exiting such policies in recent years through a variety of transactions, and Chief Financial Officer Beth Bombara, who previously led Talcott, said Sept. 12 that the insurer sees the possible advantage of a larger deal. “We’re always open to looking at other ways to move the risk to someone else,” Bombara said at a conference hosted by Barclays Plc. “Ideally, we would like to find a solution where we were able to transfer all of the liabilities and the legal entities, not do it via reinsurance. When you do pieces, reinsurance gets a little difficult.” Hartford climbed 1.1 percent to $42.42 at 2:10 p.m. Wednesday, narrowing its loss for the year to 2.4 percent. The Insurance Insider reported earlier on efforts to sell the unit. Michelle Loxton, a spokeswoman for Hartford, which is based in the Connecticut city of the same name, declined to comment. Narrowing Focus Selling Talcott would help Hartford focus on auto insurance, where the company has been caught off guard by higher-than-expected claims costs, Credit Suisse Group AG analysts led by Ryan Tunis said in a note. They said the range of $3 billion to $4 billion could be a “conservative estimate.” Jennifer Hurson, a spokeswoman for JC Flowers, declined to comment, as did a representative for JPMorgan. Charles Zehren, a spokesman for Apollo, didn’t respond to a message. Nor did Wilton Re’s Ray Eckert or Warren Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire. Hartford struck a deal in 2013 to sell a U.K. variable-annuity business to Berkshire, and agreed the next year to sell a Japanese operation to Orix Corp.

David Lim mulled the idea for seven years before he finally left the bank’s South Korea unit in February, heading back to school to start a new career as a physical therapist. For the 43-year-old father of one, the country’s shrinking financial industry and booming health-care sector made the decision to pursue his passion a little less daunting. “Because Korea is aging fast, people are growing more and more health conscious,” said Lim, who left his role in banking sales at JPMorgan to join the health sciences program at the University of Otago in New Zealand. After graduation, he plans to eventually start his own business in Korea. Lim is among a growing number of bankers turning to stronger segments of Korea’s job market as the nation’s financial industry grapples with weak profitability, tepid economic growth and rising corporate defaults. Financial-sector employment shrank by 3.3 percent in the year through October 2015, versus gains of at least 1.9 percent over similar periods in Hong Kong, New York and the U.K. For a related story on Korea’s business culture, click here. Employment in Korea’s health-care and technology industries, meanwhile, has been rising amid strong demand from a graying society and President Park Geun-hye’s campaign to create new growth engines in Asia’s fourth-largest economy. The shift is also visible in the nation’s $1.3 trillion stock market, with shares of health-care and technology companies leading gains among 11 industry groups this year. “I have a positive view on the IT and health-care sectors in the long-term,” said Lee Kyoung Min, a Seoul-based analyst at Daishin Securities Co. “They are probably two of the few industries that can actually grow in today’s economy.” Korean health-care businesses are booming as the nation ages. The health and social work segment of gross domestic product expanded by 8.1 percent in the second quarter, versus 3.3 percent for the economy as a whole. On the employment side, health-care jobs climbed 1.3 percent in the 12 months through October 2015, according to the latest government data available. The proportion of Koreans aged 65 and above will more than triple by 2060 to 40 percent of the population, according to Statistics Korea. Steady Growth The nation’s changing demographics helped convince Lee Jung Ha, a 49-year-old former head of currency trading at Woori Investment & Securities (now part of NH Investment & Securities Co.), to leave his two-decade career in finance and start a nursing home near Seoul. Lee Jung Ha Source: Lee Jung Ha It’s an industry with “steady growth,” said Lee, who studied for months to pass a nursing-care test and completed a year of field training before opening his facility -- Life Is Beautiful -- in August. “Sometimes I miss the trading room, but I am more excited with this new path.” Eunice Kim, a former trading analyst at ING Bank in Seoul, found her new career in the technology industry. After leaving ING in 2011, Kim worked at her family’s electronics manufacturing business until it was purchased last year. She joined a U.K.-based technology startup in May to run its Korea operations, drawn to the company’s flexible working hours and the potential for a big payday if the firm succeeds. “If things go well, there may be buying interest from U.S. tech companies,” said Kim, 35, who declined to name her current employer because she’s not authorized to speak to media. “This will be a great opportunity for me both financially and professionally.” Korea’s technology industry has been a standout in the nation’s job market, expanding 6.4 percent in the year through October 2015 thanks in part to President Park’s efforts to build a “creative economy” fueled by high-tech entrepreneurs. The government announced plans this month to invest 15.3 trillion won ($13.9 billion) in areas such as software engineering, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and smart cars next year. Men’s Club For shareholders of Korea’s technology and health-care companies, 2016 has been a banner year. Companies in the two sectors have climbed 21 percent and 26 percent, respectively, based on a market-capitalization-weighted average of their returns. That compares with a 4.5 percent increase in the benchmark Kospi index and a 5 percent gain in financial stocks this year through Thursday. The Kospi added 0.2 percent on Friday. Gaining exposure to high-flying industries doesn’t come cheap. Korea’s health-care stocks are valued at an average 102 times reported earnings, while tech shares command a multiple of 61 -- almost six times higher than that of financial companies. Still, there are good reasons for financial firms to trade at a discount. Per-share earnings for companies in the MSCI Korea Financials Index dropped by about 5 percent over the past year as record-low benchmark borrowing costs squeezed banks’ net-interest margins, while the delinquency rate on Korean bank loans rose to the highest in 13 months in July. Bankers who left the business see benefits beyond just being part of a faster-growing industry. Lim was attracted to the long “occupational lifespan” of physical therapists, who can perform the job into their 60s and beyond. Lee, the former Woori trader, achieved a long-time dream of running his own business, while Kim was able to escape what she called a “young men’s club” on the trading floors of big banks. “I have no regrets about leaving,” Kim said. “I enjoy my work and I feel fulfilled every day.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

USA TODAY John Stumpf, chairman and CEO of the Wells Fargo & Company, testifies before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee September 20, 2016 in Washington, DC. (Photo: Win McNamee, Getty Images) CEOs aren't alone bringing home giant paychecks from the nation's big banks. Less-recognized executives at these banks are also making major bank, outstripping the pay of CEOs of even some rival financial institutions. Half of the 10 best-paid executives at the nation's banks in the Standard & Poor's 500 aren't the chief executive officers of their companies. They include JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chief Operating Officer Matthew Zames, Bank of America (BAC) COO Thomas Montag and Mary Callahan Erdoes, who is the chief of the asset management unit of JPMorgan Chase, according to a USA TODAY analysis of 2015 compensation data from the banks' most recent filings. Bank of America's Montag out-earned his own bank's CEO (Brian Moynihan) and that of Citigroup (C) as well (Michael Corbat). USA TODAY Ask Matt: How to check if Wells Fargo tricked you All told, 17 named non-CEO executives at the 17 banks in the S&P 500 raked in more than the median $8 million that CEOs at those same banks got. Named executives include heads of major bank divisions, chief operating officers and chief financial officers. "One thing this tells us is that bank pay is not measured against the right performance metrics," says Eleanor Bloxham, chief executive officer of The Value Alliance, a firm that specializes in corporate finance. These large paychecks to named officers are paid without them incurring the same responsibility as CEOs, and that provides the incentive to take on additional risk, she says. Understanding that fat paychecks at banks go beyond just the CEOs became more important this week as Congress looked into the incentives of executives at Wells Fargo (WFC), which is accused of secretly opening millions of accounts for customers. Carrie Tolstedt, head of Wells Fargo's community banking unit at the center of the alleged fraud, was paid $9.1 million last year, which is more than the pay of eight of the 17 CEOs at S&P 500 banks. She also owns Wells Fargo shares valued at $43 million, says S&P Global Market Intelligence. USA TODAY These are the banks you gripe about the most The financial sector has a history of paying large compensation packages to top executives well beyond just the CEO. Three of the companies with the highest average pay for named executive officers between 2012 and 2014 were Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), according to an analysis by pay-tracking firm Equilar. That's not to say that bank CEOs aren't paid well themselves. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf and JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon were the best-paid bankers last year, hauling in $19.3 million and $18.2 million, respectively. That's well above the median $10.8 million paid to S&P 500 CEOs last year. But adding in the next five best-paid named bank executives, none of whom are CEOs, add up to a total haul of $120 million. Looks like you don't have to be CEO to make bank. 122 CONNECTTWEET 77 LINKEDIN 14 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2cYjwYC

As demand for traditional banking services suffers through a nationwide credit squeeze and the worst recession in a century, global banks such as JPMorgan and Credit Suisse are trying to elbow in on the top players in the restructuring business, including Moelis, PJT Partners, Rothschild and Lazard. “As the top bond underwriter in Latin America, we saw our business really shrink on the flow side in 2015, so it was a strategy for us to look for new opportunities," Leoni, head of debt capital markets for JPMorgan in Brazil, said in an phone interview this month.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Gene Marks September 22 Follow @genemarks You know that little boutique around the corner that never seems to have any customers? Or the frozen yogurt store that sits lonely in February? Or the little café that seems empty most of the time?  C’mon, you probably think to yourself: How do these places stay in business? How many dresses/vanilla cones/cups of coffee do they have to sell just to make the rent, let alone cover overhead and…oh…turn a profit? Well, wonder no more. Your question has been answered.  And unfortunately the answer isn’t good. Those small businesses are barely staying in business.  That fact was confirmed in a new study by the JPMorgan Chase Institute, according to this report from Bloomberg. “Most small businesses are operating on very small margins,” Diana Farrell, chief executive of the JPMorgan Chase Institute, told Bloomberg. The study analyzed 470 million transactions by 570,000 small businesses last year and here’s the result: The average small business has about 27 days of cash reserves on hand. Restaurants are in the worst shape, with only 16 days of cash. Firms in the real estate sector fared better with 47 days of cash. Many financial experts I speak to say a company should have at least six months of cash in reserve in case things turn south, which means that the study’s numbers aren’t good. More disturbingly, the bank found that cash inflows for the typical small business exceeded its outflows by an average $7 per day. No, that is not a typo. Before anyone panics, outflows do include any transfers made to the owners for savings or (more likely) spending. Regardless, not a lot is left over in the business to cover anything unexpected. Is it the economy? The political environment? Too much taxation? Over-regulation?  Lots of groups and pundits point fingers. Or it could be that many of us just aren’t great business people. In the end, and speaking as a business owner, it comes down to the individual entrepreneur’s ability to turn a cash profit…and not just $7 a day.

USA TODAY John Stumpf, chairman and CEO of the Wells Fargo & Company, testifies before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee September 20, 2016 in Washington, DC. (Photo: Win McNamee, Getty Images) CEOs aren't alone bringing home giant paychecks from the nation's big banks. Less-recognized executives at these banks are also making major bank, outstripping the pay of CEOs of even some rival financial institutions. Half of the 10 best-paid executives at the nation's banks in the Standard & Poor's 500 aren't the chief executive officers of their companies. They include JPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chief Operating Officer Matthew Zames, Bank of America (BAC) COO Thomas Montag and Mary Callahan Erdoes, who is the chief of the asset management unit of JPMorgan Chase, according to a USA TODAY analysis of 2015 compensation data from the banks' most recent filings. Bank of America's Montag out-earned his own bank's CEO (Brian Moynihan) and that of Citigroup (C) as well (Michael Corbat). USA TODAY Ask Matt: How to check if Wells Fargo tricked you All told, 17 named non-CEO executives at the 17 banks in the S&P 500 raked in more than the median $8 million that CEOs at those same banks got. Named executives include heads of major bank divisions, chief operating officers and chief financial officers. "One thing this tells us is that bank pay is not measured against the right performance metrics," says Eleanor Bloxham, chief executive officer of The Value Alliance, a firm that specializes in corporate finance. These large paychecks to named officers are paid without them incurring the same responsibility as CEOs, and that provides the incentive to take on additional risk, she says. Understanding that fat paychecks at banks go beyond just the CEOs became more important this week as Congress looked into the incentives of executives at Wells Fargo (WFC), which is accused of secretly opening millions of accounts for customers. Carrie Tolstedt, head of Wells Fargo's community banking unit at the center of the alleged fraud, was paid $9.1 million last year, which is more than the pay of eight of the 17 CEOs at S&P 500 banks. She also owns Wells Fargo shares valued at $43 million, says S&P Global Market Intelligence. USA TODAY These are the banks you gripe about the most The financial sector has a history of paying large compensation packages to top executives well beyond just the CEO. Three of the companies with the highest average pay for named executive officers between 2012 and 2014 were Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM), according to an analysis by pay-tracking firm Equilar. That's not to say that bank CEOs aren't paid well themselves. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf and JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon were the best-paid bankers last year, hauling in $19.3 million and $18.2 million, respectively. That's well above the median $10.8 million paid to S&P 500 CEOs last year. But adding in the next five best-paid named bank executives, none of whom are CEOs, add up to a total haul of $120 million. Looks like you don't have to be CEO to make bank. 122 CONNECTTWEET 77 LINKEDIN 14 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2cYjwYC

Climate Week NYC, an annual environmental side-event coinciding with the start of the United Nations General Assembly, is winding down. For several days, venues across Manhattan hosted summits, panels and forums to build up momentum for the annual Conference of the Parties (COP) climate talks, which this year will be held in Marrakesh, Morocco. Climate Week also brings together some of the world’s largest corporations, many of which sponsor the event to showcase their progress on mitigating climate risks. But Rainforest Action Network (RAN) insists the large multinational banks that sponsored Climate Week are not exactly putting their money where their mouthes are. Instead, RAN claims these banks are plunking their money into fossil fuel projects around the world, which in turn negates any the progress they’re making on climate change. A 2016 report, published by RAN along with partners, reveals the scale of the financial sector’s investments in petroleum, natural gas and coal. From 2013 to 2015, 25 of the world’s largest banks financed almost $800 billion in fossil fuel investments. These banks include Climate Week platinum sponsor Bank of America, affiliate sponsor JPMorgan Chase and supporting sponsor BNP Paribas (which owns Bank of the West). Juxtaposed against other sponsors, which include SolarCity, the climate advisory EcoAct and the Sustainable Coffee Challenge, the banks’ participation in Climate Week comes across as odd considering their far-reaching investments in the fossil fuels sector. Climate Week’s banking sponsors are only a few of the world’s largest banks RAN and its partners evaluated in the study. Researchers analyzed the largest banks in the U.S., Canada and Europe, and graded them based on the level of financing within the coal, liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, and extreme oil (as in: tar sands or extreme offshore oil) sectors. RAN, along with BankTrack, Sierra Club and Oil Change International, also evaluated the companies’ disclosures related to human rights. Grades of a C or lower are the norm in the industry, according to the findings. A B- is rare, and it’s worth noting that Bank of America and JPMorgan both received this score. BNP Paribas scored a C+. The RAN report has its claws out for just about every multinational bank, including Deutsche Bank, the financier behind Blackhawk Mining. The Kentucky-based company became a coal powerhouse this decade by purchasing the assets from struggling coal producers such Arch Coal and Patriot Coal. As a result of $1.3 billion in loans from Deutsche Bank, the company continued mountaintop removal (MTR) mining across Appalachia. RAN says such practices contributed to the destruction of mountains throughout the region, as well as to health problems such as birth defects, cancer and heart disease. Deutsche Bank announced earlier this year that it would no longer underwrite loans for MTR mining projects, but RAN insists plenty of damage has already been done. But it is platinum sponsor Bank of America that is often called out for what RAN infers as hypocrisy for supporting Climate Week on the one hand yet financing fossil fuel projects with the other. RAN estimates the bank invested as much as $69 billion in oil, gas and coal projects this decade. And the group has a point, especially considering that the company says it has financed $53 billion in “low carbon activities” since 2007. And this about more than these banks’ contribution to climate change and environmental degradation. As other advocacy groups point out, including the activist investor NGO Ceres, banks’ continued investments in fossil fuels exposes investors to a bevy of risks. And those risks include: stranded assets that stay in the ground as more private companies and governments invest in clean energy technologies; exposure to human rights abuses that can result in backlash against a company operating overseas; and the prospect that conventional energy prices will stay low for a long time. That turns investments in expensive projects such as tar sands and offshore oil extraction into huge liabilities on a company’s balance sheet, whether it’s a financial institution or not.

The long-awaited regulation would require banks to put up much more capital to support investments in physical commodities, restrict involvement with power plants and limit the amount of trading banks can do. While the Fed doesn’t have the power to sever banks’ ties to physical commodities, it is seeking massive capital increases for the activities -- especially at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which have special legal exemptions to stay in those businesses. Fed officials estimated that the rule would mean about $4 billion in additional capital for the industry’s current level of investment, though Wall Street has been steadily backing away.  ‘Catastrophic Risk’ “The proposal would help reduce the catastrophic, legal, reputational, and financial risks that physical commodity activities pose to financial holding companies,” the Fed said in a statement. Though it’s unstated, the proposal also addresses years of criticism that banks could seize unfair advantages in metal and energy markets by owning hard assets and operating huge trading desks at the same time. Shares of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley fell Friday after the Fed’s announcement. Goldman Sachs dropped 1.7 percent to $165.13 in New York. Morgan Stanley slid 1 percent to $31.91. The proposal, which contends the “possibility of an environmental accident due to these activities presents significant risks to the firms,” comes on the heels of a Fed recommendation made earlier this month that big banks should be barred from buying stakes in non-financial companies -- a removal of merchant-banking abilities that Congress would have to initiate. Merchant banking will also face higher capital under the Fed’s proposal. Together, the recommendations are part of the central bank’s broad goal to rein in how Wall Street invests its money outside of traditional lending. The effort stems in part from a 2014 Senate investigation that probed the industry’s sometimes controversial dealings in physical commodities, such as operating mines, warehousing aluminum and shipping oil. That Senate probe accused Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase & Co. of using their ownership of metals and other physical commodities to dominate markets and gain unfair investing advantages. The physical commodities businesses at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were protected by grandfathering that allowed them wider abilities than most banks -- an advantage the Fed is seeking to curtail by putting a 1,250 percent risk weight on the assets they could hold under that grandfathering. Shying Away The 1,250 percent risk weighting basically means about $1 in capital would be needed for every $1 in investment. For banks other than those eligible for grandfathering, they’ll face 300 percent risk weighting for physical commodities -- meaning they’d have to maintain triple the capital a bank needs to back up construction loans or corporate debt, for instance. The agency said its aiming for a “level of capitalization for such activities that is roughly comparable to that of nonbank commodities trading firms.” Meanwhile, banks that were once big players in physical commodities have shied away. Morgan Stanley sold off its oil business last year and backed away from industrial metals trading, and JPMorgan shed a big part of its physical commodities business in 2014. While Goldman Sachs dumped a coal-mining operation in 2015, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein has maintained that commodities trading is a “core” part of his firm’s business. Spokesman for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the proposal. JPMorgan didn’t respond to a request for comment. Merchant Banking Two weeks ago, the Fed and other banking regulators released several recommendations about further restricting how the industry invests its own money. The Fed’s section called for Congress to ban merchant banking, the practice of investing in companies instead of lending them money, in which Goldman Sachs has been a leader. The agency also said the original grandfathering of the two banks should be erased. Merchant banking and commodities activities are cousins, because they both involve banks chasing returns outside of their customary businesses. But unlike the Fed’s new proposal on commodities, the merchant banking restriction and an end to commodities grandfathering would require intervention from lawmakers -- a challenge in a politically-divided Congress that has passed only a few significant bills affecting the financial system in recent years. Friday’s proposed rule -- open for public comments for 90 days -- also limits banks’ holdings of copper by no longer considering it a precious metal, joining an earlier proposal from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Fed would also curtail banks’ ties to the management of power plants, “because these activities do not appear over time to have been as directly or meaningfully connected to a financial activity.” Goldman Sachs The leading banks have been responding to mounting pressure for years. “We can always count on the government to firmly close the barn doors only after all the horses have run out,” said Walter Zimmermann, chief technical analyst at United-ICAP, in an e-mail. In 2014, Goldman Sachs sold metals warehousing unit Metro International Trade Services LLC that had become a lightning rod for criticism. Last year, the firm sold a port in Colombia and two coal mines in the Latin American nation, with the mine sales marking the end of operations at Goldman’s commodities principal investments group, which over 35 years invested in everything from mines to oil refineries, power plants and metals warehouses.  But the lender has continued trading commodities, and held onto the title of largest bank by commodities revenue in the first half of the year, according to London-based analytics firm Coalition. The firm wrested the No. 1 position from JPMorgan in 2014 as its rival took steps to exit certain commodities activities.  “Our commodities activities, particularly our physical commodities activities, subject us to extensive regulation and involve certain potential risks, including environmental, reputational and other risks that may expose us to significant liabilities and costs,” Goldman Sachs disclosed earlier this year. Morgan Stanley has nearly shut down its activity, with its filings showing a decline in its physical commodities to $321 million last year from $9.7 billion in 2011. Even if these new rules effectively force banks out of the commodities business, the impact on their earnings will be minimal, said Chris Kotowski, a bank analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. The rule will have the most pronounced effect on Goldman Sachs, but it will still be minimal. "It’s a relatively small business even for Goldman, and for everybody else it’s smaller than that," Kotowski said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

But going by the rally that followed Janet Yellen’s decision to hold interest rates steady, it’s the biggest thing. Throwing off concerns ranging from falling earnings to the machinations of automated traders, the S&P 500 Index surged 1.2 percent this week, the biggest gain in more than two months. Even after a drop Friday, the benchmark gauge for American equity ended less than 1 percent from its level before rate paranoia spurred the biggest selloff since Brexit on Sept. 9. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.2 percent and closed at a record on Thursday. Boosted by the Federal Reserve’s inaction, dividend payers and companies benefiting from a weaker dollar led the week’s gains. The S&P 500’s newest group, real estate, surged more than 4 percent, its best performance since July. For analysts trying to gauge the market’s most proximate threat, this week’s rally was evidence that investors can live with the declining earnings and soaring valuations as long as Yellen’s Fed is at heel. The market showed few signs of being roiled by the robotic selling among automated funds and risk-parity managers, a concern hypothesized by everyone from Bank of America Corp. to JPMorgan Chase & Co. in the wake of the Sept. 9 rout. At the same time, getting out from under the valuation cloud gets harder every time the market goes up. It raises the pressure on companies to hit analysts’ forecast for 13 percent profit growth in 2017, an increase that has rarely been seen in the past two decades. Possibly reflecting that, about $2.2 billion was pulled from an exchange-traded fund tracking the S&P 500 this week. “It seems like the central banks have things under control, they’ve really pushed out the volatility for the moment,” said Andrew Brenner, the head of international fixed income for National Alliance Capital Markets. “As long as the Fed can keep things steady, like they are today, we’re going to have continued moves in a positive way in both equities and bonds because they’re basically saying there’s nothing else in the world to invest in.” The Fed opted to wait for further evidence of stronger inflation before raising rates, even as the economy showed signs of improving. It also scaled back the number of increases it expects in 2017. That decision assuaged fears of resurfacing volatility, at least for now. The CBOE Volatility Index, a measure of market volatility, fell 20 percent, it’s most since July 1. Strategists are also turning more upbeat. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Dubravko Lakos-Bujas and Bank of Montreal’s Brian Belski boosted their S&P 500 year-end projections. Lakos-Bujas, one of the biggest bears in a Bloomberg survey, increased his estimate by 100 points to 2,100, while the BMO strategist now sees the S&P 500 climbing 3.9 percent to 2,250, up from his call of 2,100. “By not hiking rates, the Fed provided the markets with precisely what they had been expecting, and in doing so, removed a significant downside surprise,” Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients Thursday. “As a result, we see no catalyst for a major market correction or meltdown between now and year-end.” Investors now turn their attention to the corporate earnings season that gets underway in about three weeks, with technology companies expected to report profits 3.5 percent higher than a year ago, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The Nasdaq 100 Index ended Thursday at a record, logging the 12th fresh high this year, the most since before the dot-com bubble. Since the Brexit vote in late June, Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Facebook Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. count for more than a quarter of the S&P 500’s advance. Real-estate investment trusts also made their debut as a top-level industry in the S&P 500. The 11th group finished the five days with the biggest gain in the index, as REITs, coveted for their high payouts while Treasury yields languish, benefited from the Fed’s decision. Energy shares fared worst in the week, rising just 0.1 percent. As crude tumbled below $45 a barrel, the sector dropped 1.3 percent on Friday to all but erase its gains from earlier in the week. With the economy now in focus, a Bloomberg gauge tracking the degree to which data miss or exceed economists’ estimates has been negative for all of September. Reports are due next week on durable-goods orders, services and personal spending in the world’s biggest economy. “The market is reassured that the Fed didn’t do anything stupid and that gave a green light to risk takers,” said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at the Chicago-based Northern Trust Corp. “The Fed is off the table until December, so it’s going to be the economy and the election as equal focuses over the next couple of months.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.
