Options traders have become more bullish on the yen as the election nears, while hedge funds wagered since early January that the currency will gain. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and HSBC Holdings Plc say that neither Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump will favor a stronger dollar, so any short-term fluctuations in the yen as the vote nears are likely to give way to gains for the Japanese currency over the longer term. An expected Federal Reserve rate increase also may already be priced in. “Regardless of which candidate becomes president, U.S. policies are expected to be more protectionist and keep a cap on the dollar,” said Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan markets research at JPMorgan in Tokyo. There is another reason for the dollar rally to wane, he said. “If the Fed does raise interest rates in December, it will likely follow the same pattern as last year where the dollar and U.S. yields rose until a rate increase and then declined.” Japan’s currency slid 1.3 percent to 104.46 per dollar on Monday, erasing much of its gains from last week, after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it was sticking by its finding that Hillary Clinton didn’t commit a crime in her handling of e-mails. It was a fresh reminder for investors of the market’s volatility amid the final days of the election campaign as the euro and the Swiss franc also dropped, while Mexico’s peso soared. The most accurate currency forecasters saw steeper gains in the yen should Trump win than declines in the event of a win for Clinton, in a survey by Bloomberg News. Despite futures signaling 80 percent odds for a Fed interest-rate increase in December, the dollar faltered against the yen last week with its steepest slide since July. The yen fell in November 2015 before rebounding in December, when the U.S. central bank hiked borrowing costs for the first time in a decade. Its 15 percent surge this year is the strongest performance among Group of 10 currencies. Click here for how the top forecasters expect the dollar to react after the vote Currency options indicate traders are more concerned about yen gains than declines. The cost to protect against an advance in Japan’s currency rose to the highest since June on Monday, relative to the cost to insure against dollar strength, one-month risk reversals show. The yen was at 104.46 per dollar as of 1:26 p.m. in Tokyo Tuesday. Meanwhile, analysts are sticking with their forecasts. The median projection from strategists surveyed by Bloomberg has the currency rising to 103 per dollar by March 31. That level hasn’t shifted since analysts last boosted their yen estimates early last month. Wagers from leveraged funds for the yen to gain against the dollar exceeded bets on declines as of Nov. 1 by 28,114 contracts, according to the latest data available from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The net longs peaked in September at an eight-year high of 64,179 contracts. HSBC also sees the dollar’s recent rallies making the currency prone to declines.  “Both candidates favor a weak dollar, so dollar selling may gain momentum after the election,” said Shuji Shirota, head of the macroeconomic strategy group at HSBC Securities Japan Ltd. in Tokyo. “The risk of the dollar falling below 100 yen will heighten towards the end of the year and into next year.” The Japanese currency’s strength faces some headwinds from local bond investors, especially after its advance stalled over the past two months or so when it bounced off the 100 per dollar area, a level Deutsche Bank AG sees as key for some of Japan’s biggest money managers. That’s led institutional investors, including life insurance companies, to express interest in boosting unhedged foreign bond investment in the second half of the fiscal year, meaning they would be selling yen to buy dollars when they purchase debt abroad. Deutsche Bank AG sees 100 yen as crucial for life insurers. “Life insurers may help support the dollar/yen by boosting unhedged foreign bond purchases if views are sustained for the pair to hold above 100,” said Taisuke Tanaka, Deutsche Bank’s chief currency strategist and head of fixed-income research in Tokyo. “But, if the dollar falls deep below 100 yen, they could accelerate dollar selling in order to boost hedging ratios on foreign bonds they already hold.” JPMorgan’s Sasaki also regards 100 yen as a key level. “Life insurance companies may be more proactive in unhedged foreign bond investment if they see the dollar is firming around 100 yen, and such a view may actually be a factor behind the relatively solid dollar-yen,” Sasaki said. “Their stance may be one factor supporting the dollar-yen but it won’t change the bigger trend.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    China may give Wall Street firms long-sought permission to run their own investment-banking arms on the mainland, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people briefed on the talks. Officials in Beijing are considering the move amid discussions for a new trade and investment framework with the U.S., the newspaper said. Under existing rules, U.S. firms offer services to companies on the mainland by taking minority stakes in joint ventures with China’s domestic brokerages. Such arrangements have long frustrated some of the world’s biggest banks, which have struggled to challenge local players in China while relinquishing control of key decisions, as well as a share of profits. JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest U.S. bank, said last month it’s in talks to sell a stake in a partnership, JPMorgan First Capital Securities, potentially freeing itself to get more control through a new venture. People briefed on China’s deliberations cautioned that talks are continuing and that details would need to be worked out with regulators, the Wall Street Journal said. An agreement also would need to be ratified by the U.S. Senate, the paper said. Small Share Firms including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS Group AG also established Chinese joint ventures more than a decade ago. But most foreign-backed joint ventures remain minnows in China. JPMorgan First Capital ranked 120th out of China’s 125 securities firms by net income in 2015, according to the Securities Association of China. UBS Securities Co. whose 296 million yuan ($44 million) profit was the biggest among foreign-backed joint ventures, came in at 95th place. JPMorgan’s local partner, First Capital Securities Co., has said it’s held talks to buy the U.S. firm’s stake. The joint venture generated 156 million yuan of revenue in the first half. JPMorgan has weighed options including forming a new joint venture under a framework established in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, people familiar with the matter said last month. That framework opens the door for overseas banks to achieve greater control of local ventures and pick partners that aren’t in the securities business, they said. Even so, the rules have yet to be finalized, the people said.   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved. Click Here to comment on this article Close  More ways to share...

The potential fees and reputation boost that could come from working on Uber Technologies Inc.’s initial public offering are the stuff of bankers’ dreams. Yet at least two investment banks passed on selling shares of Uber to their high-net worth clients—shares eventually sold by other banks in January—because the ride-share company wasn’t willing to provide financial details about its business, people with knowledge of the matter said. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank AG both turned down the opportunity to offer their wealthiest clients the option to invest in Uber, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley ended up selling the shares earlier this year through those firms’ private wealth divisions. JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank were concerned they wouldn’t be able to fill demand for the offering given the lack of specifics, the people said. Deutsche Bank also took into consideration that share sales through banks’ private-wealth divisions are unusual, and it hadn’t done one before, one person said. The last such offering of a big technology company was more than four years ago. In that case, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold private shares of Facebook Inc. to international clients before the company went public in 2012. Long game With a company like Uber, the major banks play a long game of relationship building to be best positioned when the company does pick banks to go public. While the Uber share sale was run through the private wealth divisions, it may still help put the firms in the company’s good graces. With the timing of any Uber IPO unclear, banks’ willingness to forgo that business is notable. Before that sale, it seemed like Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick and his management team had most of the leverage. For example, the company told bankers if the firms do any business for its biggest U.S. competitor, Lyft Inc., they’d be less likely to be hired, according to people familiar with those discussions. So far, Kalanick has managed to deflect questions about the timing of the IPO. As recently as last month, he likened Uber to an “early high schooler” being asked to the prom. It’s still a little too soon, he insisted. That reflected some progress from what he’d said a year earlier: “We’re like eighth graders; we’re in junior high, and someone is telling us that we need to go to the prom.” High valuation Uber hasn’t had any trouble raising money since its founding in 2009, because investors typically want in on a highly valued startup before it goes public and the banks want a shot at a role when it does. The San Francisco-based company has garnered more than $16 billion in cash and debt since it started more than six years ago, most recently at a valuation of $69 billion. If it were to go public at that level, it would have a higher valuation than almost 90% of the companies in the S&P 500 Index. JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank passed on the opportunity to do business with Uber just as investor sentiment started to change for market-bound technology companies. There was a backlog of closely held Internet companies, with more than 144 valued at more than $1 billion, research firm CB Insights said in a report. Path to profitability Colin Stewart, a managing director at Morgan Stanley who oversees tech financing at the bank, said at the time that private placements would no longer be the place to find “very strong valuations with a plethora of investors hanging around the hoop.” Underwhelming post-IPO performance by some technology companies, including payments company Square Inc., didn’t help. Investors wanted to see a clear path to profitability. The 290-page prospectus Morgan Stanley sent to prospective investors before the January sale didn’t include Uber’s net income or annual revenue. The document did include 21 pages of risks, namely competition, regulatory hurdles and no assurance that the clients would see any return on their investment. The New York-based bank addressed the lack of data in its prospectus, saying “the development of insights and big ideas is valuable to the investment process, whereas obsession over incremental ‘information’ flow is not.” Uber initially asked Deutsche Bank to be on the offering because it wanted to sell the stock to international investors, one of the people said. Demand for the offering was higher from international clients than domestic, according to two people familiar with the matter. There was demand for more shares than were offered, another person said. Despite passing up on a role in the private offering, JPMorgan advised Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund on its $3.5 billion investment in Uber that was announced in June. A spokesman for Uber declined to comment. Representatives of JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while a representative for Bank of America didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The consensus view is that Clinton does prevail, but analysts are concerned that the final election result may drag beyond Tuesday night in a tight or contested race. And there is always the possibility that the Street gets the election wrong, just as traders did not expect the U.K. to vote to leave the European Union in June. The S&P 500 fell 5 percent after "Brexit" before recovering. The S&P 500 closed at 2,085.18 on Friday, posting a nine-day losing streak for the first time since 1980 as the race between Trump and Clinton appeared to tighten. The index fell about 3 percent over that time. Here's what the major banks are predicting for markets after the election: JPMorgan If Clinton wins, the S&P 500 should recover about 3 percent to 2,150 and European and emerging market stocks should rise 3 to 4 percent, Mislav Matejka and other JPMorgan analysts said in a Monday note. They agreed with the consensus view that a Clinton victory remains more likely than a Trump win. "We believe that if Trump wins, markets are likely to fall further — one should not use the Brexit template where stocks bounced quickly," the note said, referring to the rebound shares made shortly after the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU. Expected effects on specific sectors Source: JPMorgan US Equity Research Goldman Sachs "Our central election expectation continues to be that Sec. Clinton wins the White House, with a slim Democratic majority in the Senate — quite possibly a 50-50 split with the vice president breaking the tie — and a somewhat smaller Republican majority in the House than the 246 seats they currently hold," Goldman economist Alec Phillips said in a Monday note, which did not provide expectations on the market reaction to an election outcome. "With tight polling in several states, it looks quite possible that a final outcome in the presidential race might not become clear until early on November 9," the note said. "The same holds true in the Senate races, where a delayed outcome in one seat could keep either party from winning an outright majority on election night." Barclays The S&P 500 could potentially fall 11 to 13 percent if Trump wins the election, Keith Parker, global equity strategist, said in a Nov. 1 note. If Clinton wins, the index could rise 2 to 3 percent. "We see the U.S. election as first: a risk-off/on event initially that has the greatest effect on equities/rates given the uncertainty," he said. "Second, a macro event that (affects) currencies and to a lesser extent commodities; lastly, a micro event that (affects) a number of industries but one that will play out over time as agendas are implemented." After the Oct. 28 market reaction to news about a new FBI probe into Clinton's emails, Barclays found that health care could underperform by 2 to 3 percent if Clinton wins. Other notable stock reactions that day included weakness in trade-related equities such as railroads, trucking and air freight, particularly railroad Kansas City Southern, which Barclays said has the highest sales to Mexico in the S&P. Citi "The tail risks of a Trump victory or a Democratic 'sweep' could result in a market correction in the 5 percent range (similar to Brexit), after which the investment community reassess the environment," Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Tobias Levkovich said in a Nov. 3 note. Regardless of which candidate wins, Levkovich expects consumer discretionary, energy, financials — especially regional banks — and technology stocks to generally perform well. Materials and real estate should also do well if Trump prevails, according to Levkovich's analysis. US sector recommendations Notes: 1) Multinational trade issues 2) Defense budget trade impact 3) Clinton does not have a real estate background 4) Environmental issues. Source: Citi Research - US Equity Strategy However, more market weakness could arise if no candidate gets the needed 270 electoral college votes or if Clinton wins and Trump does not concede, Levkovich said in the note. The S&P 500 fell more than 5 percent from election day on Nov. 7, 2000, to the Supreme Court decision on Dec. 12 that year deciding a contested vote in George W. Bush's favor. BMO "The worst-case scenario is we don't have decision on Tuesday," said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets. He said a Trump win would likely result in "jittery" markets, and while markets would likely be "happy" with a Clinton victory, questions around the political implications of the election for markets would linger for several months. Note: R: Republican, D: Democrat. Source: BMO Investment Strategy Group. Morgan Stanley "Our base case is a divided government limiting policy action to incremental tax changes and infrastructure spending," analysts from Morgan Stanley's fixed income strategist team led by Michael Zezas said in a Nov. 1 note.

(STR/AFP/Getty Images) Credit Suisse AG is broadening its business in China, a move that puts the Swiss investment bank at odds with foreign rivals, some of which are reconsidering their China relationship after decades of slow growth and regulatory setbacks. The bank announced Nov. 2 that it will open an onshore securities brokerage through Credit Suisse Founder Securities, a joint venture in which Credit Suisse retains a 33.3 percent ownership stake. The brokerage will operate in the Qianhai free trade zone in Shenzhen, and will count both Chinese and foreign institutional investors as clients. The Swiss Bank is ramping up its China brokerage business on anticipation of greater onshore demand from the extension of the Shanghai-Hong Kong stock trading link to Shenzhen and in the future, other markets. The possible inclusion of Chinese A shares in MSCI’s widely followed global emerging markets index would also drive foreign business to Credit Suisse.  With last week’s announcement, Credit Suisse joins Goldman Sachs and UBS as the only foreign banks with brokerage capabilities in China. JPMorgan Exits Credit Suisse’s decision comes a month after JPMorgan said that it would exit its current joint venture JPMorgan First Capital. While JPMorgan has denied that the sale of its First Capital stake means a full exit from the China market, it does signal that the bank is reconsidering its business model in China. JPMorgan established the China venture in 2010 for equity and debt underwriting, and similar to Credit Suisse, owned a 33.3 percent stake. JPMorgan First Capital is profitable, but its small scale has been a drag. The joint venture generated a scant 18 million yuan ($3 million) in net profits last year. In an era where banks face increasing scrutiny from shareholders and regulators on risk management and capital deployment, Western banks have been reviewing the value of their Chinese presence. Shut Out of China The Chinese communist regime views banking as a core state industry and limits control and economic exposure foreign banks can hold. Wall Street banks must form a local joint-venture and are capped to a minority stake. Initially the ownership cap was one-third but in 2012 the threshold was increased to 49 percent, although no foreign bank has yet taken the step to increase their ownership. Source: Securities Association of China (data), Epoch Times (chart) As a whole, overseas institutions have made little headway in China since the country ostensibly opened up the market more than two decades ago. Morgan Stanley was the first foreign investment bank to set up a presence, forming China International Capital Corporation (CICC), a joint-venture with China Construction Bank. Today, CICC is no longer owned by Morgan Stanley—the firm sold its share in 2010 after the authorities refused to allow a greater ownership stake. CICC is now one of the biggest investment firms in China. Most of the foreign-domestic joint ventures are profitable, but their scale of business is often miniscule, according to data from the Securities Association of China. In 2015, UBS was the most profitable with net profits of 296 million yuan ($44 million). But that amount was only 2 percent of the profits at Citic Securities, China’s biggest investment bank. For foreign banks, that lack of operational control has made scaling the business far more difficult than previously envisioned. While China has grown to become the world’s third biggest market for bond and stock issuances, foreign investment banks haven’t been able to participate in the boom. “The foreign investment banks have been losing M&A opportunities in China,” Keith Pogson, senior partner in EY’s Asia Pacific financial services business, told Euromoney earlier this year. “There has been less paid in fees. And as returns on investment banking in China have been crushed, the investment banks have been downsizing their teams. The investment banks are in some cases being cut out of finder’s fee arrangements and are more being paid fees for negotiations and other services.” It’s telling that for a country with Asia’s biggest and the world’s second biggest economy, Goldman Sachs has been the only Western investment bank to base its Asia regional head—Mark Schwartz, who has since announced his retirement—in Beijing. Today, having a Chinese investment banking presence—once coveted—is no longer hallmark of a successful global bank. And Beijing’s draconian foreign investment policies could mean that JPMorgan’s move is only the beginning of a trend.

Duckett, a mother of four, spoke to The Associated Press about how she started her career and what role she tries to fill as a mentor and how she tries to balance work and personal life in her new job. Q: How'd you get your start in banking? This photo provided by JPMorgan Chase & Co. shows Thasunda Duckett. Duckett became the CEO of JPMorgan Chase¿s consumer banking division in late September 2016, becoming the first African-American woman promoted to such a role at the nation¿s largest bank.(Joe Vericker/PhotoBureau/JPMorgan Chase & Co. via AP) I got into banking through a program called Inroads. It's a program that prepares minorities for corporate and community leadership. Honestly, when I think about where I am today, I would say that being a part of Inroads was and still is one of the most impactful professional moments in my life. If you talk to successful minorities, specifically African-Americans, you'll be surprised how many are Inroads alums. It really is a special program. My career started at Fannie Mae, which Inroads helped me get. I grew up in the company and really believed in the mission of making home ownership affordable and accessible but I wanted to be closer to the customer. I joined JPMorgan in 2004 doing a lot of work around affordable lending and minority home ownership programs. Q: As an African-American woman, what advice would you give to young women, particularly young African-American women, who are just starting their careers? For me, I understand that I am on the shoulders of giants. To whom much is given, much is required. It is humbling to be in the position I'm in. But I go back to things that my parents instilled in me when I was younger: I knew there is no challenge I can't overcome. I want everyone to be proud of themselves. I think it's beautiful to be me, to be a woman, to be black, to be born in New York and raised in Texas because that is who I am. I tell women or other minorities to be confident in who you are and know that you do belong. I also tell a lot of the people I speak to: don't own someone else's bias and negativity. Don't subscribe to that. That's not who you are. Q: What does your typical day look like? There is no typical day, but I would say one of my constants is I work hard to make sure I see my kids before I leave in the morning. One of my special mommy moments, if you will, is my daughter Madison will make my coffee and she will write me a little note on my coffee for me to read on my way to work on the train. That is really special to me. At work, my days are like any other executive. But I try to talk to as many employees as possible to know the business from all levels. When I was made CEO of Auto, one of the first things I did was meet with the guys in the mailroom. I don't think they've ever had a CEO in the mailroom. The reason why I did that is, one, to say thank you and help them understand the role that they play in delivering customer experience. If a customer puts the wrong address on an envelope and it doesn't post on time that creates a bad customer experience. I wanted them to know how important their job was. I do also spend a lot of time mentoring people. People that want to see how great of a company this is and what type of career mobility there is here. Q: You recently created a charity. Can you tell us about it? It's called the Otis and Rosie Brown Foundation, named after my parents. What we do is we give scholarships based on character and often seed local organizations or individuals that are making an impact. Think about those unsung heroes in our community and to be able to shine that light on them and say "thank you." The website is extraordinaryis.org .

Bank preparations ahead of the election reflect their experience following Britain’s shock vote to leave the European Union in June, when the S&P 500 fell 3.6 per cent the day after the poll. Morgan Stanley told staff to consider using stop-loss orders, an automated trading mechanism that sells an investor’s position as soon as a stock hits a preset level, if the election result causes trading volumes and volatility to spike. The bank also told advisers in its wealth management unit to prepare for election-related conversations with clients and pointed them to relevant pieces of research, according to a Nov. 7 memo reviewed by Reuters. Traders expect US stock prices to swing by about 2 per cent in either direction tomorrow, the day after the election, based on the price of S&P 500 index options. Options on the PowerShares QQQ Trust Russell 2000 ETF, are pricing similarly large swings before the week is out. Some banks are projecting a more extreme drop in the event of a victory for Republican Donald Trump, with Citigroup Inc estimating that a Trump victory could trigger a 3 per cent to 5 per cent sell-off for the S&P 500. US stocks rose yesterday as Democrat Hillary Clinton’s prospects brightened after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would not press criminal charges related to her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Investors have tended to see Clinton as a more status quo candidate, while Trump’s stances on foreign policy, trade and immigration have unnerved the market. The latest twist in the campaign and ensuing stock market rally appears to have quelled a broad push for banks to staff for an all-hands-on-deck event. The “market pretty much told you who was going to win today,” said one capital markets official at a major bank who was not planning any extraordinary staffing measures. Another official at a rival bank said yesterday’s 2.2 per cent rally in US stocks had lowered Wall Street’s collective angst over the election from “DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.” No US stock exchange plans extraordinary measures to cope with potential market volatility, exchange officials told Reuters yesterday. After the election, Morgan Stanley will hold a call for financial advisers and clients with Chief Investment Officer Mike Wilson tomorrow morning. Goldman Sachs is also hosting a call for its private wealth clients led by Chief Investment Officer Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani and members of Washington lobbying groups Elmendorf Ryan and CGCN Group, according to an invitation sent to clients. More than half of the stock and bond fund managers polled by Northern Trust in the third quarter said they expected the election to cause a large increase in market volatility. Tonight, when results begin to come in, JPMorgan will have additional traders on duty in New York to back up its Asian trading teams in case of surges in volume, said bank spokesman Brian Marchiony. The extra staffing is similar to what the bank did during Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, he said. Tomorrow morning, JPMorgan will hold conference calls to discuss the election results and investment implications with customers, including private banking clients, investment managers and institutional clients. A Citigroup spokeswoman described similar plans, including overnight staff in New York on the trading floor. Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co are also hosting calls for members of their wealth management divisions. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Nepal PM phones India’s Modi over rupee chaos Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites European equities drift higher United to delay taking Boeing jets in US$4.8b savings push Snapchat files for one of the biggest tech IPOs in years, sources say Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter Most Watched Now Week An in-depth look at Mazda’s SKYACTIV-G engine Reuters Video: Groin-flashing frog discovered in Australia Reuters Video: Supermoon dazzles in Havana Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Related Articles Lies in the guise of news in the Trump era — Nicholas Kristof UN chief confident Trump will drop rhetoric, show leadership Trump names loyalists, children to transition team (VIDEO) Donald Trump wins White House in stunning upset Shock and angst in Asia as Trump rises Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Big global banks, including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc are bracing for potential tumult on financial markets after Tuesday's U.S. election. As the outcome of the most bitterly fought U.S. presidential elections starts to roll out by Wednesday in Asia, the regional markets will be the first to trade on the results. As a result, Asia-focused banks HSBC and Japan's Nomura Holdings Ltd are among institutions boosting staff levels, while others are raising the margin requirements for trading to cope with a possible spike in volume or volatility. Bank preparations ahead of the election reflect their experience following Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union in June, when the S&P 500 fell 3.6 percent the day after the poll. In the United States, Morgan Stanley told staff to consider using stop-loss orders, an automated trading mechanism that sells an investor's position as soon as a stock hits a preset level, if the result causes trading volumes and volatility to spike. The bank also told advisers in its wealth management unit to prepare for election-related conversations with clients and pointed them to relevant pieces of research, according to a Nov. 7 memo reviewed by Reuters. 2 PERCENT SWING Traders expect U.S. stock prices to swing by about 2 percent in either direction on Wednesday, the day after the election, based on the price of S&P 500 index options. Options on the PowerShares QQQ Trust Russell 2000 ETF, are pricing similarly large swings before the week is out. Some banks are projecting a more extreme drop in the event of a victory for Republican Donald Trump, with Citigroup Inc estimating that a Trump victory could trigger a 3 percent to 5 percent sell-off for the S&P 500. U.S. stocks rose on Monday as Democrat Hillary Clinton’s prospects brightened after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would not press criminal charges related to her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Investors have tended to see Clinton as a more status quo candidate, while Trump's stances on foreign policy, trade and immigration have unnerved the market. The "market pretty much told you who was going to win today," said one capital markets official at a major bank who was not planning any extraordinary staffing measures. Another official at a rival bank said Monday's 2.2 percent rally in U.S. stocks had lowered Wall Street's collective angst over the election from "DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2," referring to the U.S. Defense Department's levels of alert. ASIA IMPACT Brokerage Nomura said in a report on Monday the election was the largest "known unknown" markets have had to contend with since the global financial crisis. It said a Trump victory would likely lead to a more than 6 percent drop in Asian equities. The election could result in both higher trading volumes and higher volatility as it's a bigger event for investors in this region than Brexit, said Stephane Loiseau, head of Societe Generale's Asia Pacific cash equities and global execution services. It plans to increase front office, back office, and technology staff, "ensuring we have a clear escalation system for handling decision-making", and possibly raising risk limits." Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at IG Markets in Melbourne, said his firm had raised margins on U.S. indices and some dollar trades to 1 percent from 0.5 percent, but doesn't expect to see "a massive collapse or spike". HSBC will bolster staff on trading floors in major hubs including London and Hong Kong to deal with client requests, said a person with direct knowledge of the plan. "Around any high profile, potentially market-moving event, it is not unusual for some trading desks to increase staffing levels," said a spokesman for Europe's biggest bank. No U.S. stock exchange plans extraordinary measures to cope with potential market volatility, exchange officials told Reuters on Monday. More than half of the stock and bond fund managers polled by Northern Trust in the third quarter said they expected the election to cause a large increase in market volatility. The extra staffing is similar to what the bank did during Britain's vote to leave the European Union, he said.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:30 AM, November 8, 2016 Updated: 12:00 AM, November 9, 2016 Big global banks, including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc are bracing for potential tumult on financial markets after Tuesday's U.S. election. As the outcome of the most bitterly fought U.S. presidential elections starts to roll out by Wednesday in Asia, the regional markets will be the first to trade on the results. As a result, Asia-focused banks HSBC and Japan's Nomura Holdings Ltd are among institutions boosting staff levels, while others are raising the margin requirements for trading to cope with a possible spike in volume or volatility. Bank preparations ahead of the election reflect their experience following Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union in June, when the S&P 500 fell 3.6 percent the day after the poll. In the United States, Morgan Stanley told staff to consider using stop-loss orders, an automated trading mechanism that sells an investor's position as soon as a stock hits a preset level, if the result causes trading volumes and volatility to spike. The bank also told advisers in its wealth management unit to prepare for election-related conversations with clients and pointed them to relevant pieces of research, according to a Nov. 7 memo reviewed by Reuters. 2 PERCENT SWING Traders expect U.S. stock prices to swing by about 2 percent in either direction on Wednesday, the day after the election, based on the price of S&P 500 index options. Options on the PowerShares QQQ Trust Russell 2000 ETF, are pricing similarly large swings before the week is out. Some banks are projecting a more extreme drop in the event of a victory for Republican Donald Trump, with Citigroup Inc estimating that a Trump victory could trigger a 3 percent to 5 percent sell-off for the S&P 500. U.S. stocks rose on Monday as Democrat Hillary Clinton’s prospects brightened after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would not press criminal charges related to her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Investors have tended to see Clinton as a more status quo candidate, while Trump's stances on foreign policy, trade and immigration have unnerved the market. The "market pretty much told you who was going to win today," said one capital markets official at a major bank who was not planning any extraordinary staffing measures. Another official at a rival bank said Monday's 2.2 percent rally in U.S. stocks had lowered Wall Street's collective angst over the election to DEFCON 4 from DEFCON 2, referring to the U.S. Defense Department's levels of alert. ASIA IMPACT Brokerage Nomura said in a report on Monday the election was the largest "known unknown" markets have had to contend with since the global financial crisis. It said a Trump victory would likely lead to a more than 6 percent drop in Asian equities. The election could result in both higher trading volumes and higher volatility as it's a bigger event for investors in this region than Brexit, said Stephane Loiseau, head of Societe Generale's Asia Pacific cash equities and global execution services. It plans to increase front office, back office, and technology staff, "ensuring we have a clear escalation system for handling decision-making", and possibly raising risk limits." Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at IG Markets in Melbourne, said his firm had raised margins on U.S. indices and some dollar trades to 1 percent from 0.5 percent, but doesn't expect to see "a massive collapse or spike". HSBC will bolster staff on trading floors in major hubs including London and Hong Kong to deal with client requests, said a person with direct knowledge of the plan. "Around any high profile, potentially market-moving event, it is not unusual for some trading desks to increase staffing levels," said a spokesman for Europe's biggest bank. No U.S. stock exchange plans extraordinary measures to cope with potential market volatility, exchange officials told Reuters on Monday. More than half of the stock and bond fund managers polled by Northern Trust in the third quarter said they expected the election to cause a large increase in market volatility. The extra staffing is similar to what the bank did during Britain's vote to leave the European Union, he said.

(AMZN) Stock Can Make You Money, Even When It’s Overpriced AMZN stock's valuation is always in doubt, but you can make still money By Nicolas Chahine, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Nov 7, 2016, 12:25 pm EST     Popular Posts: Alphabet Inc (GOOG, GOOGL) Stock Can Earn You Free Money Get Paid to Catch the Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Knife 2 Gold Stocks to Profit From for Cheap (JNUG GDX) Recent Posts: Get Paid to Catch the Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Knife Fill Your Cup With Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Stock 2 Gold Stocks to Profit From for Cheap (JNUG GDX) View All Posts Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) rewrote the book on how to grow a company’s top line. Under Jeff Bezos, AMZN stock managed to enter and dominate dozens of high profile industries … one of which was what we’ve come to know as ‘the cloud.’ Source: Atomic Taco Via Flickr As accomplished as this company has been, I still see stubborn experts trying to short AMZN stock for fundamental reasons. Sure, I’ve occasionally had short AMZN positions, but they were always part of a range trade. I have shared trades that generated profits out of thin air by selling iron condors into AMZN. Here is a November trade that generated over $3 per contract of pure profit. This was 20% yield on money risked in just three months. AMZN Stock Chart I agree that on paper, AMZN stock looks extended. But for a company that has so far grown perpetually, the traditional valuation measuring sticks are not as useful. Click to Enlarge Technically, one could have made an argument that $700 per share was in the cards since 2007. Today I want to rinse and repeat. AMZN stock reported a decent quarter, yet markets sold it down $100 on general political fears. This is usually an opportunity to sell some bullish risk below market levels. 7 A-Rated Cheap Stocks to Buy for Rapid-Fire Growth Meaning I sell bullish put spreads with a healthy buffer below. Amazon Stock Trade Ideas Trade No. 1 — The Bet: Sell AMZN Dec $710/$705 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 50 cents per contract to open. By selling it, I have an 85% theoretical chance of yielding 10% on money at risk. When selling spreads, I like to leave room for error. In this case I only have a 6% buffer from current price. Usually I like a bigger buffer, but AMZN has recently fallen about $100 from its highs. To mitigate risk I often like to balance my bet. To do that I can set a similar but opposing trade. Trade No. 2 — The Hedge (Optional): Sell AMZN Dec $845/$850 credit call spread. This is a bearish trade for which I collect 41 cents per contract to open. This trade has a buffer of 10% from current price. This would theoretically translate into an 85% chance of success to yield an additional 8% on money risked. Click to Enlarge Taking both trades, I would have sold an iron condor, which is a range-bound trade, meaning I need AMZN stock price to stay between both trades to earn maximum profits. This setup is much tighter than my usual preference. But since I already have had several wins under my belt from Amazon, I am going a bit more aggressive with this thread-the-needle trade. I do have to recognize that short term, AMZN stock needs a bounce or risks inviting more technical sellers. This would likely be decided by the outcome of the Elections. After 15 Years, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is Cool Again The AMZN bounce would require a clear win for Clinton. If we get a contested outcome, then the uncertainty would linger thereby placing more downside pressure on equity markets in general. I am not required to hold these AMZN trades through expiration. I can close either for partial gains or losses at any time. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

(AP Photo/LM Otero, File) Taxpayers are still bailing out Wall Street, eight years later By Renae Merle Washington Post Nov 7, 2016 (…) In this Sept. 24, 2013 file photo, a sheet of uncut $100 bills makes the way through the printing process at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing Western Currency Facility in Fort Worth, Texas. (AP Photo/LM Otero, File) The Associated Press NEW YORK • Eight years after taxpayers rescued the U.S. financial system, some of the country's largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, continue to receive billions in bailout money, according to government data. Wells Fargo is eligible for up to $1.5 billion in bailout funds over the next seven years. JPMorgan and Bank of America could receive $1.1 billion and $964 million respectively. The continuous flow of funds is a remnant of the $700 billion bailout effort, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP, signed into law by President George W. Bush in October 2008, during the financial crisis. Some of that money, about $28 billion, was carved out to help distressed homeowners by paying banks to lower their interest rates and monthly payments. The program, the Home Affordable Modification Program, has undergone several revamps over the last few years and fallen short of helping the 3 million to 4 million homeowners the administration of President Barack Obama initially hoped. But it continues to operate — HAMP will accept its last homeowner application at the end of this year — and big banks continue to be paid for helping. The stream of cash for the big banks is worrisome to Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or SIGTARP, the chief watchdog of the financial crisis-era bailouts. Many of the banks have repeatedly broken the rules of the program, including kicking homeowners out unfairly or making it too difficult to apply for the help. "Why are we paying for nonperformance? ... At what point is somebody is going to say enough and is enough?" said Christy Goldsmith Romero, special inspector general with the Troubled Asset Relief Program, who investigates crime at companies that received taxpayer bailout funds. "If a homeowner doesn't follow the rules in HAMP they get knocked out of the program. If a bank doesn't follow they still get paid by Treasury." The banks and the Treasury Department, which oversees HAMP, defend the program. The "error rates" have fallen significantly, Mark McArdle, deputy assistant secretary for financial stability, said in a statement. The SIGTARP report is "inaccurate," Wells Fargo said in a statement. "We respond quickly to correct any errors we identify or that are brought to our attention." Bank of America said it has helped more than 2.1 million customers avoid foreclosure through HAMP and other programs. "These initiatives continue to help those who face financial difficulty today, even as the economy has recovered overall," the bank said in a statement.

The biggest beneficiary of the housing program, by far, is little-known financial company Ocwen. The Atlanta company services millions of mortgages for investors, including collecting payments from homeowners. It has already received $2.9 billion from the HAMP program and over the next seven years, it could receive $2.6 billion more. "We are extremely proud of our performance and our success in helping struggling borrowers remain in their homes," Ocwen said in a statement.

That was the finding reached by S. Katherine Roy, chief retirement strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. She hosted a presentation on the topic at the recent Schwab IMPACT conference in San Diego. Parents can create the bandwidth to fund college tuition and retirement if they begin saving as early as possible. Grandparents can help them get there with well-timed tax-free gifts, too. "The good news is that if you do everything right, funding public school tuition is doable, and you can keep your retirement on track," said Roy. Early sacrifices In collaboration with Michael Conrath, a 529 program director at JPMorgan, Roy put together a case study to tackle the question of whether it's possible to save for retirement and college. The cost of education would be highest for those with younger children. If a couple today has a newborn, it will cost $455,585 to send him or her to a four-year private institution, according to JPMorgan's projections. The cost of a public institution, on the other hand, will be $202,768. The case study tracks a hypothetical married couple, the Lees. They are 28-years-old with a newborn, and they'd like to have a second child in two years. The two have been working since age 22, earning total income of $60,000, and their salaries are growing at a rate that varies by age, based on JPMorgan's analysis of individual wage data from the Social Security Administration. The Lees have also been contributing to their 401(k)s since they've started their careers, earning an average annual rate of return of 6.5 percent. Finally, the couple has been saving for college since the birth of their first child, earning a return of 6 percent per year. The magic number The couple can accumulate $6.5 million by age 65 if they begin saving 15 percent of their salaries in their 401(k)s at age 22, according to JPMorgan's research. That deferral rate includes the Lees' 12 percent contribution, plus a 3 percent company match. When the first child arrives, the couple, who will be 28 years old, can dial back their retirement plan savings rate to 12.2 percent and begin investing the difference — the equivalent of 2.8 percent of salary — into a 529 college savings plan. After they have their second child at age 30, the couple continues saving to their 401(k), this time at a rate of 9.4 percent. The difference, which is equal to 5.6 percent of salary, continues to go toward the college savings plan. Once the first child starts college and the Lees turn 46, they can ratchet up their retirement plan savings to 12.2 percent and continue to fund the college plan. After their youngest begins his or her higher education, the parents can revert to their original 15 percent deferral rate into their retirement plans. They will maintain that level of savings until they retire at age 65. Help from Grandma Everyone wins if the grandparents decide to pitch in, according to JPMorgan's research. You can make a lump sum contribution of up to $70,000 —$140,000 if you're married and filing jointly — to a 529 if you spread the gift out over five years. Per the case study, if the grandparents make a $140,000 gift to the college savings account after the birth of the first child, the Lees can continue deferring 15 percent of their salaries into their retirement plans. By the time they reach retirement at age 65, they'll have $7.8 million in their 401(k)s. Meanwhile, the grandparents have the added benefit of funding the kids' college expenses and moving the gifted assets out of their estate. "Gifting to others is something we've started to do more," said Roy. "Contribute to the 529 and take advantage of the estate planning benefit." Reaching for private school Roy admitted that even with a solid savings plan, fully funding four years at a private college for two kids is a stretch. Past guidelines have called for parents to use up to a third of their earnings to pay for college, she said. "It's difficult to cover a third of the cost from current income; [the family] will be eating cat food," Roy said. A combination of saving early in a 529 plan, plus gifts from grandparents, can help families reach for private school. A child can also take out a small student loan to help cover the costs. "What if they take out one semester's worth of loans?" said Roy. "Some studies suggest that it's not bad for kids to have some skin in the game and it makes them commit to the process."

The 2016 campaign — by far the worst and most depressing in MM’s lifetime — finally comes to a merciful close. Hillary Clinton maintains a slim national polling lead (1.8 percent in RCP). And she is ahead in enough states to produce 297 electoral votes and win the White House. She could add to that total with potential wins in Ohio, Nevada, North Carolina and New Hampshire. Donald Trump’s path requires flipping Florida and taking at least one of Clinton’s “blue wall” Midwestern states. The early vote in Florida does not bode well for Trump, especially a huge spike in Latino voters. The Trump campaign apparently thinks it can win Michigan, though public polling continues to show Clinton with a nearly 5-point lead in the state. And the Clinton campaign got a burst of good news Sunday afternoon when FBI Director James Comey informed Congress that a review of recently discovered emails would not change their decision not to pursue a case against Clinton. Trump could certainly still win. But it would require a much bigger swing-state turnout among less-educated white voters than most models expect. Story Continued Below SEND US YOUR MAPS — Email me your electoral vote totals for Tuesday night and your calls for the Senate and House on bwhite@politico.com. MARKETS RALLY ON FBI NEWS — Reuters’ David Henry and Rodrigo Campos: “U.S. equity index futures rallied at the open on Sunday as bullish sentiment returned to Wall Street following the largest streak of losses on the S&P 500 since 1980. “The news from the FBI and recent reports of Clinton starting to regain strength in public opinion polls likely explain the move higher in stock futures and in the Mexican currency, said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of investment management firm Destination Wealth Management of Walnut Creek, California.” Read more. TRUMP WIN COULD TANK DOLLAR — Bloomberg’s Andrea Wong and Anooja Debnath: “The dollar will plunge toward the weakest since 2013 against the yen in the wake of an election victory for … Trump, the most-accurate currency forecasters say. Within 24 hours, the greenback will drop to 100 yen or lower if Trump is voted president, according to the majority of the top 10 foreign-exchange analysts in Bloomberg’s third-quarter rankings. “If Hillary Clinton wins, they see an advance. The dollar surged 0.8 percent to 103.97 yen as of 7:26 a.m. in Tokyo on Monday after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it maintains the view Clinton’s handling of her e-mails wasn’t a crime The survey of leading currency analysts shows that even the biggest and most liquid global markets face sharp swings and volatility in the aftermath of Tuesday’s vote, with repercussions set to spread around the world” Read more. ASIA RISES — Asian stocks bounced and the dollar strengthened on Monday after the FBI said it stood by its earlier recommendation that no criminal charges were warranted … Clinton. The news lifted a cloud over Clinton's presidential campaign … and boosted S&P 500 Index futures by 1.2 percent, a gain that is likely to snap a nine-day losing streak in the U.S. stock index - its longest in more than 35 years. But volumes were thin, indicating many investors had already taken to the sidelines ahead of the vote. Read more. INVESTORS LESS WORRIED ABOUT DEM WAVE — Via Goldman’s Weekly Kickstart email: “Two weeks ago, investors voiced concern about the possibility of a Democratic ‘wave election,’ which would make policy changes more likely, and expressed hope the race would tighten. Having tightened, however, the race has lifted equity uncertainty and implied volatility. Despite the S&P 500 realizing volatility during October of just 7, the VIX index of implied volatility jumped to 22 this week. “Our volatility strategist Buzz Gregory notes that the spread between implied and realized volatility ranks in the 99th percentile since 1990, suggesting a potential swift VIX collapse if uncertainty declines post-election. However, a surprise election outcome could cause both realized and implied volatility to rise even further.” WALL STREET BUYS ITS OWN POLLS — Business Insider’s Rachael Levy: “Unwilling to rely on public polls conducted mostly by the media and universities … hedge funds and other large investors are paying for their own poll data and analysis. And they're paying a lot more than any news outlet or school would pay for more precise data that isn't always publicly available. “The point is to get a higher-quality, more accurate read on possible outcomes than a cash-strapped paper might be able to, or to ask specific questions that public pollsters may not be thinking of, says Scott Tranter, cofounder of Øptimus, a DC-based data firm. … For investors, there's money to be made even just by knowing that Clinton's lead isn't as fragile as the latest polls indicate, which could [impact] markets.” Read more. MEET TOM NIDES — Alec MacGillis writes on the Hillary Clinton and Wall Street in the new issue of the New Yorker with a focus on Morgan Stanley’s Tom Nides, “widely admired for his commitment and his judgment, as well as for his humor and his personal warmth. But he has also been involved in some of the major episodes that pulled the Democrats closer to big business and to Wall Street” Read more. COMEY TO CONGRESS: NEVER MIND — POLITICO’s Gabriel Debenedetti: “Another day, another bombshell. The ever-turbulent presidential race took another dramatic turn on Sunday afternoon as … Comey revealed in a letter to Congress that newly-discovered messages would not affect his bureau’s decision that … Clinton did not deserve prosecution — a revelation that comes a little more than a week after Comey first set the race into a frenzy” Read more. SENATE FORECAST: DEMS NARROWLY FAVORED — POLITICO’s Burgess Everett and Rachael Bade: “Democrats look like slightly-better-than-even favorites to reclaim the Senate, while Republicans appear certain to hold the House … If Democrats manage to flip the Senate, senior party aides and strategists involved in battleground races said they’re looking at a majority of 52 seats, best case. That would be a letdown from their earlier hopes of a 54- or 55-seat advantage, and put Republicans in the pole position to win back the chamber in 2018” Read more. PENCE: TRUMP WILL CONCEDE IF RESULT IS CLEAR — GOP VP nominee Mike Pence on “Fox News Sunday”: “The campaign’s made it very clear — a clear outcome, obviously both sides will accept … I think both campaigns have also been very clear that in the event of disputed results, they reserve all legal rights and remedies” Read more. CLINTON CAMP ON DODD-FRANK — In the latest Wikileaks email dump, here’s the Clinton campaign’s Josh Schwerin in a note to senior advisers Jake Sullivan and John Podesta: “John, I talked to Barney Frank today and he forcefully suggested that HRC should speak out about the on-going attacks against financial reform in the new Congress. He also said that if she did, he would make sure Warren and others on the left applauded. Earlier we avoided getting involved in the Cromnibus fight in part because it would have meant getting crosswise with the WH, but that no longer feels like an issue” Read more.

Let’s send Americans paychecks for life. Learn more at: http://irionline.org/agenda. ** WAGES POP — POLITICO’s Ben White: “Clinton’s campaign can breathe a little easier … following a solid October jobs report issued just four days before the election. In the best news for Clinton and the Democrats, wages for American workers are now rising at the fastest pace in seven years. … Stagnant wages have plagued the economy since the latest recovery began seven years ago, helping drive voter anxiety and aiding the rise of Trump’s brand of aggressive, nationalist populism. That story is now changing. ‘This is clearly a boost to the Clinton campaign. The economy is solid and most importantly wage growth is accelerating,’ said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. ‘And most people think of their financial world through the prism of their paycheck. Now they can say it’s bigger than last year.’” Read more. HPS jobs day cheat sheet is here. CHINA OPENS UP TO WALL STREET — WSJ’s Julie Steinberg: “Beijing is considering allowing Wall Street banks to run their own investment-banking businesses on the mainland … a significant step that would give them more access to Chinese domestic markets that have been hard to crack. “The long-awaited move, which is being discussed as part of a new U.S.-China trade and investment framework, would mean companies like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. could conduct investment-banking business in China on their own, such as underwriting initial public offerings on domestic exchanges. Currently, foreign financial firms operating on the mainland must pair up with domestic brokerages in joint ventures in which they hold minority stakes, split profits and have a limited scope of business” Read more. LIBERALS PUSH STEIN AT SEC — POLITICO Pro’s Patrick Temple-West: “Stein, who has sometimes clashed with White in pushing for tougher penalties on misbehaving companies and for greater investor protection, is being promoted by liberals who have voiced disappointment in the current SEC chair.” “Stein pressed for a stronger “Volcker rule,” the section of Dodd-Frank that banned banks from proprietary trading. She also hammered her fellow commissioners for voting to give financial firms permission to continue doing certain business operations after the companies agreed to misconduct settlements with the agency.” Read more. BRUSSELS PLAYS HARDBALL — FT’s Alex Barker and Jim Brunsden: “Brussels is reconsidering how it grants EU market access to overseas financial firms, casting doubt over the use of the bloc’s “equivalence” arrangements as a fallback option for the City of London after Brexit. “Any move to tighten the access regime would signal that Brussels will let Britain take nothing for granted in negotiations to leave the EU. It would also be a blow to the US and more than a dozen jurisdictions, who fear approval for their pending applications will be waylaid by Brexit politics.” Read more. SODA WARS — POLITICO’s Helena Bottemiller Evich: “Residents in San Francisco, Oakland and Albany, Calif., are voting Tuesday on a referendum that would impose penny-per-ounce taxes on sugary drinks from Coca-Cola to Gatorade in what has become the most expensive city-level ballot fight ever waged in the United States. “Using the same media firm that ran the Brexit campaign, the powerful American Beverage Association has spent nearly $30 million to oppose the taxes. Proponents, meanwhile, have poured nearly $20 million into the effort, with most of it coming from Bloomberg, whose unsuccessful effort to ban super-sized sodas while mayor of New York City was pilloried.”Read more. SAMSUNG’S COMEBACK BID — Bloomberg’s Jungah Lee: “Samsung Electronics Co. plans to equip its next Galaxy S smartphones with a Siri-like digital assistant, seeking to make a comeback after the global debacle that precipitated the death of its flawed Note 7 lineup. “Samsung, which last month acquired U.S.-based artificial-intelligence software company Viv Labs Inc., said the Galaxy S8 slated for next year will come with AI-enabled features “significantly differentiated” from those of Apple Inc.’s Siri or Google, executive vice president Rhee In-jong told reporters. Those services now offer up potentially useful information from the weather to flight times based on user activity.” Read more. VW CHAIRMAN IMPLICATED — FT’s Patrick McGee: “The German market manipulation probe into the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal has expanded to include Hans Dieter Pötsch, chairman of the supervisory board who was finance chief when the scandal broke. “Volkswagen announced on Sunday morning that the criminal probe launched in June by public prosecutors in Braunschweig against former chief executive Martin Winterkorn and VW brand head Herbert Diess now includes Mr Pötsch.” Read more. BAIDU DOES DELIVERY — Bloomberg News’: “Baidu Inc. is seeking to raise as much as $500 million for its Waimai food delivery unit amid a costly battle with other Chinese internet giants for customers, according to people familiar with the matter. “Using scooters to supply everything from Starbucks coffee to sliced sashimi, Waimai is in a pitched battle with rivals to sign up delivery men and convince restaurants to join its service. Baidu is up against Ele.me, which scored a $1.25 billion investment from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., and the Meituan-Dianping business backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd.” Read more. A TALE OF TWO COMPANIES — NYT’s Nick Wingfield and Kate Benner “Today, Microsoft and Salesforce are archrivals that recently battled each other to buy the social network LinkedIn — hungry for its troves of highly personalized data about businesspeople. When Microsoft won, Salesforce threw cold water on the acquisition by saying it would violate European antimonopoly laws. “A behind-the-scenes look at the fight between Salesforce, which upended business software by pioneering a rent-by-the-month model, and Microsoft, which is racing to adjust, exposes an awakening in corporate America about the value of social networks like LinkedIn and Twitter. The data stashed in their servers has elevated services like these from an amusing distraction to an essential tool that helps big businesses understand their customers.” Read more. WIKILEAKS STINGS MEZVINSKY — POLITICO’s Kenneth P. Vogel: “Chelsea Clinton’s husband used his connections to the Clinton family and their charitable foundation to raise money for his hedge fund, according to an allegation by a longtime Clinton aide made public Sunday in hacked documents released by WikiLeaks. “Marc Mezvinsky extended invitations to a Clinton Foundation poker event to rich Clinton supporters he was courting as investors in his hedge fund, and he also relied on a billionaire foundation donor to raise money for the fund, according to the WikiLeaks documents. They also assert that he had his wife Chelsea Clinton make calls to set up meetings with potential investors who support her family’s political and charitable endeavors” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: As traditional pensions have disappeared, American workers have become more responsible for saving and preparing for their retirements. With longer lifespans, this often means saving for a longer retirement. These challenges have made planning and saving for retirement more difficult. But what if all Americans could get paychecks for life? Policymakers can help make this possible by supporting policies that encourage saving, make workplace retirement plans more broadly available, and facilitate access to lifetime income strategies.

Shows Good Morning America Good Morning America World News Tonight World News Tonight Nightline Nightline 20/20 20/20 This Week This Week Live Video Insider Q&A: Thasunda Duckett, Chase's New Consumer Bank CEO By ken sweet, ap business writer NEW YORK  Nov 6, 2016, 11:01 AM ET 0 Shares Email Star 0 Shares Email Thasunda Duckett became the CEO of JPMorgan Chase's consumer banking division in late September, becoming the first African-American to hold that job at the nation's largest bank by assets. Duckett, a mother of four, spoke to The Associated Press about how she started her career and what role she tries to fill as a mentor and how she tries to balance work and personal life in her new job. Q: How'd you get your start in banking? I got into banking through a program called Inroads. It's a program that prepares minorities for corporate and community leadership. Honestly, when I think about where I am today, I would say that being a part of Inroads was and still is one of the most impactful professional moments in my life. If you talk to successful minorities, specifically African-Americans, you'll be surprised how many are Inroads alums. It really is a special program. My career started at Fannie Mae, which Inroads helped me get. I grew up in the company and really believed in the mission of making home ownership affordable and accessible but I wanted to be closer to the customer. I joined JPMorgan in 2004 doing a lot of work around affordable lending and minority home ownership programs. Q: As an African-American woman, what advice would you give to young women, particularly young African-American women, who are just starting their careers? For me, I understand that I am on the shoulders of giants. To whom much is given, much is required. It is humbling to be in the position I'm in. But I go back to things that my parents instilled in me when I was younger: I knew there is no challenge I can't overcome. I want everyone to be proud of themselves. I think it's beautiful to be me, to be a woman, to be black, to be born in New York and raised in Texas because that is who I am. I tell women or other minorities to be confident in who you are and know that you do belong. I also tell a lot of the people I speak to: don't own someone else's bias and negativity. Don't subscribe to that. That's not who you are. Q: What does your typical day look like? There is no typical day, but I would say one of my constants is I work hard to make sure I see my kids before I leave in the morning. One of my special mommy moments, if you will, is my daughter Madison will make my coffee and she will write me a little note on my coffee for me to read on my way to work on the train. That is really special to me. At work, my days are like any other executive. But I try to talk to as many employees as possible to know the business from all levels. When I was made CEO of Auto, one of the first things I did was meet with the guys in the mailroom. I don't think they've ever had a CEO in the mailroom. The reason why I did that is, one, to say thank you and help them understand the role that they play in delivering customer experience. If a customer puts the wrong address on an envelope and it doesn't post on time that creates a bad customer experience. I wanted them to know how important their job was. I do also spend a lot of time mentoring people. People that want to see how great of a company this is and what type of career mobility there is here. Q: You recently created a charity. Can you tell us about it? It's called the Otis and Rosie Brown Foundation, named after my parents. What we do is we give scholarships based on character and often seed local organizations or individuals that are making an impact. Think about those unsung heroes in our community and to be able to shine that light on them and say "thank you."

Duckett, a mother of four, spoke to The Associated Press about how she started her career and what role she tries to fill as a mentor and how she tries to balance work and personal life in her new job. Q: How'd you get your start in banking? I got into banking through a program called Inroads. It's a program that prepares minorities for corporate and community leadership. Honestly, when I think about where I am today, I would say that being a part of Inroads was and still is one of the most impactful professional moments in my life. If you talk to successful minorities, specifically African-Americans, you'll be surprised how many are Inroads alums. It really is a special program. My career started at Fannie Mae, which Inroads helped me get. I grew up in the company and really believed in the mission of making home ownership affordable and accessible but I wanted to be closer to the customer. I joined JPMorgan in 2004 doing a lot of work around affordable lending and minority home ownership programs. Q: As an African-American woman, what advice would you give to young women, particularly young African-American women, who are just starting their careers? For me, I understand that I am on the shoulders of giants. To whom much is given, much is required. It is humbling to be in the position I'm in. But I go back to things that my parents instilled in me when I was younger: I knew there is no challenge I can't overcome. I want everyone to be proud of themselves. I think it's beautiful to be me, to be a woman, to be black, to be born in New York and raised in Texas because that is who I am. I tell women or other minorities to be confident in who you are and know that you do belong. I also tell a lot of the people I speak to: don't own someone else's bias and negativity. Don't subscribe to that. That's not who you are. Q: What does your typical day look like? There is no typical day, but I would say one of my constants is I work hard to make sure I see my kids before I leave in the morning. One of my special mommy moments, if you will, is my daughter Madison will make my coffee and she will write me a little note on my coffee for me to read on my way to work on the train. That is really special to me. At work, my days are like any other executive. But I try to talk to as many employees as possible to know the business from all levels. When I was made CEO of Auto, one of the first things I did was meet with the guys in the mailroom. I don't think they've ever had a CEO in the mailroom. The reason why I did that is, one, to say thank you and help them understand the role that they play in delivering customer experience. If a customer puts the wrong address on an envelope and it doesn't post on time that creates a bad customer experience. I wanted them to know how important their job was. I do also spend a lot of time mentoring people. People that want to see how great of a company this is and what type of career mobility there is here. Q: You recently created a charity. Can you tell us about it? It's called the Otis and Rosie Brown Foundation, named after my parents. What we do is we give scholarships based on character and often seed local organizations or individuals that are making an impact. Think about those unsung heroes in our community and to be able to shine that light on them and say "thank you." The website is extraordinaryis.org . © 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The market rallied simply because it loves certainty. For months, many investors assumed Clinton would be the winner of the Presidential election. So, when the FBI said it was investigating more of Clinton's emails, stocks were sent into a tailspin as the race suddenly seemed more likely to go either way. Stocks surged again on Monday on certainty when the FBI cleared Clinton's use of a private email server. This left Cramer yearning for the market to focus on earnings, not the election. "I long for the market to be, well, the market again, where we value companies on how well they are doing, not as a part of a vast basket that goes up or down depending on how certain we are about the results of the election," the "Mad Money" host said. Carlos Barria | Reuters Hillary Clinton But if Clinton does declare victory, then Cramer expects the market to go back to normal the day after the election. That means Cramer's got his eye on the companies with the best earnings that can take investors through year end. The banks were the best winners of earnings season, as they generated bigger profits than anyone expected. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and KeyCorp all blew Cramer away. Of the soft financials, Cramer was most impressed with Visa, MasterCard and American Express. The second group that performed well was the social, mobile and cloud stocks like Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon and Accenture. Transports were also a puzzling winner, as most railroads and airlines didn't make the numbers, but will likely do much better next year. Cramer liked United Continental and Norfolk Southern as comeback options. Basic industrials were also a surprise, thanks to an increase in Chinese business, a turn in Europe and an improved airline cycle. Boeing was Cramer's top pick, followed by United Technologies and Honeywell. The biggest disappointment for Cramer was the restaurants. Besides the Cheesecake Factory and Domino's Pizza, most earnings were downright miserable. The home improvement space also took a step backward with weak numbers from Masco, Sherwin-Williams and PPG. The apparel segment was also hit hard, led by Nike and Under Armour. The health care group showed promise for Cramer, courtesy of a snap back after being severely oversold. Merck delivered a strong quarter, and Cramer said he is "still reeling from the lack of respect given to Celgene." "If you look at where the money wants to go, and you figure that this election will pass …. I think that the above description of the earnings season to date will hold up until year end," Cramer said. Questions for Cramer?

Bonds retreated with gold and the yen. The MSCI All Country World Index surged the most since June, as the S&P 500 Index snapped its longest run of losses in almost 36 years, jumping more than 2 percent Monday. Emerging-market shares also climbed with Democratic candidate Clinton seen as a more predictable president than her Republican rival Donald Trump. The peso gained the most among major currencies, while a rally in the dollar versus the yen showed prices close to fully reflecting a Clinton win. Oil and metals also rose, while gold sank with Treasuries. Relief swept over markets as the election loomed, with James Comey, director of the U.S.’ Federal Bureau of Investigation, saying Sunday that the agency’s position on Clinton’s use of e-mail servers hadn’t changed and that he wouldn’t recommend criminal charges against her. Traders had been on edge since the FBI said Oct. 28 that it had reopened a probe into Clinton’s e-mail usage. While the Democrat is seen as a continuity candidate with government experience,Trump has campaigned as a political novice who has advocated winding back free-trade agreements and building a wall on the border with Mexico. “There’s a restrained global relief,” said Piet Lammens, head of research at KBC Bank NV in Brussels. “The market reacted to the message that they started the investigation and now they have to do the opposite. However, we are just one day before the election and it would be imprudent to take big positions and think everything is OK.” Clinton is leading Trump by three percentage points among likely voters nationally, the latest sign that her campaign’s painstaking focus on women, Latinos and blacks could help propel her to the White House. The final Bloomberg Politics national poll before Tuesday’s election has the Democrat ahead of Trump, 44 percent to 41 percent, when third-party candidates are included. In a two-way contest, she’s also up by three points. Speculation around Clinton’s chances helped boost odds of a Federal Reserve interest-rate hike next month. The probability of higher borrowing costs by year end is 80 percent, up from 76 percent on Friday, according to fed funds futures trading compiled by Bloomberg. While riskier assets are climbing before the U.S. election, trading patterns around the U.K.’s referendum over European Union membership provide a cautionary tale. A similar rally in stocks, emerging markets and commodities on the day of the British vote gave way to a slump -- and a rebound in haven assets -- after the unexpected decision in favor of Brexit. The outlier this time around is the dollar, which is strengthening, having weakened before Britain’s plebiscite. Stocks MSCI’s global gauge climbed 1.6 percent as of 4:15 p.m. in New York, its steepest advance since June 29. The S&P 500 rallied 2.2 percent to 2,131.37, wiping out its November decline as the Dow Jones Industrial Average added more than 370 points. The measure of market turbulence known as the VIX slid 17 percent after surging 39 percent last week. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Microsoft Corp. advanced more than 2.9 percent, while Biogen Inc. led gains in health-care stocks. “We’ve been down nine straight days as concerns over a potential Trump victory put a lot of caution in the market,” said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. Regardless of how prices react on Nov. 9, next-day moves in the S&P 500 are basically useless at foretelling what comes after. While the index swings an average of 1.5 percent the day after the vote, gains or losses over the first 24 hours predict the market’s direction 12 months later less than half the time. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index jumped 1.5 percent after posting its 11th consecutive day without gains for the first time since 1994. HSBC Holdings Plc climbed amid a surprise increase in adjusted profit, while Glencore Plc and Antofagasta Plc paced a rally in miners. PostNL NV surged after Belgian mail service Bpost SA revived an approach to its Dutch counterpart. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index climbed 1.7 percent for its first increase in five days. Brazil’s Ibovespa and Mexico’s IPC index led gains and Hungarian shares rose to a record after the country was returned to investment grade by Moody’s Investors Service. Egypt’s EGX 30 gauge extended an eight-day rally on bets a decision to float the nation’s currency will help cement a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. Currencies Mexico’s peso posted the biggest advance among major currencies, climbing 2.3 percent. It’s moves have been tied to Trump because the Republican has pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 10 major counterparts, rose 0.4 percent following a six-day decline. The greenback advanced 0.9 percent to $1.1040 per euro, and 1.3 percent to 104.48 yen. The dollar’s surge sent the greenback close to the levels likely to prevail if Clinton won the presidential election. The U.S. currency rose as much as 1.5 percent to within 0.6 percent of the 105.25-yen level that the top 10 currency forecasters see it reaching within 24 hours of a Clinton victory. A majority said the dollar would tumble through 100 yen if Trump won. “Our base case is that Clinton wins and the dollar strengthens” into the Fed’s meeting in December, said Robert Rennie, head of financial-markets strategy in Sydney at Westpac Banking Corp. He sees the dollar at 105 should the Democrat be victorious. “Clearly, markets appear to have embraced that view today,” he said. The yuan dropped the most in a month after China’s central bank weakened the currency’s reference rate and as the greenback rebounded. Bonds Treasuries led declines among the safest sovereign bonds, with two-year notes falling for the first time in seven days amid speculation that a potential Clinton win would open the way for the Fed to raise rates next month. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields climbed five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.83 percent, their increase since Oct. 27, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. “For the Fed, as much as they want to stay out of politics, they’re reading the tea leaves to see what happens,” said Michael Franzese, head of fixed-income trading in New York at MCAP LLC, a broker-dealer. “You would assume if Clinton gets in, it’s status quo around the globe. It’s definitely two visions.” Ten-year German bunds, perceived to be among the safest debt securities in Europe, slid relative to those of Italy and Spain. Yields on 10-year U.K. gilts rose seven basis points to 1.20 percent. Commodities The Bloomberg Commodity Index rose 0.6 percent, the most since Oct. 27, the day before the Clinton’s e-mail issue was reignited by the FBI. Gold futures for December delivery slid 1.9 percent to settle at $1,279.40 an ounce on the Comex in New York, their steepest decline since Oct. 4. Oil rebounded amid a broader market rally and after OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo said Russia, the world’s biggest energy producer, is “on board” with an agreement to limit crude production. “The U.S. election is front and center in all the markets,” said Chris Kettenmann, chief energy strategist at Macro Risk Advisors LLC in New York. “There was talk over the weekend of Russia agreeing to limit production in cooperation with OPEC, but we need to see a resolution from the Nov. 8 vote before the focus shifts to Nov. 30.” West Texas Intermediate oil for December delivery climbed 1.9 percent to $44.89 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while Brent for January settlement rose 1.3 percent to $46.15 a barrel in London.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:30 AM, November 8, 2016 CHICAGO - Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N> is in talks with several mobile wallet companies to offer more payment options in its Wal-Mart Pay app, an executive at the world's largest retailer said, after signing up JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> last week. Starting next year, Chase Pay will become the first third-party digital wallet on Wal-Mart's website and app, they said on Thursday. Customers can pay within the app with any major credit, debit, pre-paid or Walmart gift card. Daniel Eckert, senior vice-president of services at Wal-Mart U.S., said in an interview late on Friday that the retailer would tweak its marketing for the app after the most frequent users turned out to be Gen X customers, born from 1965 to 1967, and baby boomers born from 1946 to 1964. "The target demographic during the launch of a technology product tends to be younger, more male, so we have had that target market in mind," Eckert said. U.S. mobile payments accounted for an estimated $67 billion in 2015, and are expected to grow this year to $83 billion, or 24 percent of all purchases made via smartphones, according to the latest Forrester Research data. Apple Inc's <AAPL.O> Apple Pay or Alphabet Inc's <GOOGL.O> Android Pay are the most popular digital wallets, and U.S. retailers have launched many mobile payment apps in the last two years. But acceptance has been slow, largely because most systems require new equipment at stores. Wal-Mart Pay was launched in December 2015 and can be used in all of the retailer's 4,600 U.S. stores. Customers at the checkout counter must choose the payment option within the app on their smartphone, and activate the camera to scan the code at the register. An e-receipt is sent to the app. Eckert also said more than 90 percent of transactions on the app involve customers are using the service more than three to four times a month.

The upbeat tone was set by overseas markets that reacted to the announcement by FBI Director Comey that the latest investigation in Hillary Clinton’s emails produced no actionable information. The S&P 500 index appears on track to end a 9-day losing streak, the longest in 36 years. All sectors traded higher Monday, led by financials and healthcare.

The DJIA stock posting the largest daily percentage gain ahead of the close Monday was JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) which traded up 3.08% at $69.85. The stock’s 52-week range is $52.50 to $69.91, and the high was posted this afternoon. Volume was about 10% below the daily average of around 13.5 million shares. The big bank had no specific news, but prospects for a Fed interest rate increase is likely pushing the financial sector up. Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) traded up 3.06% at $34.64.

With the strong upward move, the major averages regained ground after ending last Friday's trading at their lowest closing levels in about four months. The major averages ended the day just off their highs of the session. The Dow jumped 371.32 points or 2.1 percent to 18,259.60, the Nasdaq soared 119.80 points or 2.4 percent to 5,166.17 and the S&P 500 surged up 46.34 points or 2.2 percent to 2,131.52. The rebound on Wall Street came on the heels of news the FBI has once again cleared Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton of criminal charges related to her use of a private email server while Secretary of State. "Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton," FBI Director James Comey wrote in a letter sent to members of Congress on Sunday. Late last month, Comey revealed that the FBI re-opened its probe of Clinton after learning of the existence of new emails on a device obtained in connection with an unrelated investigation. U.S. officials familiar with the case told the Washington Post the new emails were either personal or duplicative of those found earlier. The news that Clinton has been cleared for a second time is seen as boosting her chances of emerging victorious on Election Day on Tuesday, which could be a positive for stocks. JPMorgan analysts predicted the S&P 500 would jump by 3 percent from last Friday's close if Clinton wins the election. Sector News Most of the major sectors moved higher amid the broad based rally on Wall Street, although substantial strength was visible among electronic storage stocks. The NYSE Arca Disk Drive Index jumped 5.3 percent after ending the previous session at a four-month closing low. Datalink (DTLK) led the storage sector higher after the company agreed to be acquired by Insight Enterprises (NSIT) in a deal valued at approximately $258 million. Considerable strength was also visible among steel stocks, as reflected by the 4.3 percent gain posted by the NYSE Arca Steel Index. With the gain, the index reached its highest closing level in well over a year. Biotechnology stocks also moved notably higher on the day, driving the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index up by 4.1 percent. Amgen (AMGN) posted a notable gain after the FDA approved the company's application for the expanded use of Enbrel. Transportation, semiconductor, and banking stocks also saw significant strength, reflecting the broad based buying interest. Meanwhile, gold stocks were among the few sectors to buck the uptrend, dragging the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index down by 4 percent. The weakness in the sector came amid a steep drop by the price of gold. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved higher during trading on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index surged up by 1.6 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced by 0.7 percent. The major European markets also saw significant strength on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index jumped by 1.7 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index both shot up by 1.9 percent. In the bond market, treasuries moved to the downside amid the rally on Wall Street. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, climbed 4.5 basis points to 1.828 percent. Looking Ahead Trading activity may be somewhat subdued on Tuesday as traders await the outcome of the U.S. elections. A lack of major U.S. economic data may also keep some traders on the sidelines. On the earnings front, Marriott (MAR), News Corp. (NWSA), and Priceline (PCLN) are among the companies releasing their quarterly results after the close of today's trading. CVS Health (CVS), D.R. Horton (DHI), Johnson Controls (JCI), and SeaWorld Entertainment (SEAS) are also due to report their results before the start of trading on Tuesday. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America More Top Stories UPS Strike Could Put Wrench In Holiday Shipping Find McRib With Your Phone Stocks Close Mostly Higher Following Upbeat Retail Sales Data - U.S. Commentary Obama's Job Approval Rating Jumps To Four-Year High Americans Optimistic Trump Will Improve The Economy Tech CEO Threatens To Shoot President-Elect Trump Giuliani Reportedly New Favorite To Be Secretary Of State Major Averages Remain Mixed In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Nasdaq And S&P 500 Move Higher But Dow Gives Back Ground - U.S. Commentary Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances U.S. Business Inventories Rises Less Than Expected In September AAA: Low Gas Prices Drive Spike In Thanksgiving Travel Putin Calls Trump, Agrees To Work To Mend "extremely Unsatisfactory" Ties <<Previous        57 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates Vodafone Slips To Pre-Tax Loss On Hefty India Charge; Narrows FY View Merck KgaA Lifts FY16 Earnings View As Q3 Results Climb, Stock Up Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Amaya Gets Huge Buyout Bid From Former CEO Zuckerberg: Facebook Hoax News Did Not Get Trump Elected Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Siemens To Buy Mentor Graphics For $4.5 Bln Enterprise Value Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy ADAP Surges As FDA Lifts Clinical Hold, OCUL Catches Eyes, RegeneRx On The Rise AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD Pfizer : IBRANCE Approved In Europe To Treat HR+/HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer Engie 9-month EBITDA Declines - Quick Facts FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Google Rejects EU Antitrust Charges Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Walmart Introduces Black Friday 2016 Deals; Walmart App's Deals Start Today Vivendi Turns To Profit In Q3, Revenues Up; Maintains View K+S Group Posts Q3 Negative EBIT I; Cuts 2016 EBIT I View Frankfurt Airport Oct.

Demand for haven assets waned, with high-quality government bonds, the yen and gold retreating. The MSCI All Country World Index was set for its biggest gain since June, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 300 points and European shares rebounded from a four-month low as Clinton is seen by investors as the more predictable candidate. The peso jumped the most in a month, and a rally in the dollar versus the yen showed prices close to fully reflecting a Democrat win. Oil and metals paced gains in materials, while gold sank with Treasuries. Financial markets have been on edge since FBI director James Comey's announcement Oct. 28 that the bureau was looking into more Clinton e-mails from an unauthorized server. All the jitters with election polls showing a tighter presidential race spurred a flight to relatively safer assets last week. That came to a halt just before tomorrow's vote, as Comey yesterday said his agency kept a July conclusion that it wouldn't recommend criminal charges against Clinton. “There's a restrained global relief,” said Piet Lammens, head of research at KBC Bank in Brussels. “The market reacted to the message that they started the investigation and now they have to do the opposite. However, we are just one day before the election and it would be imprudent to take big positions and think everything is OK.” Clinton is leading Republican Donald Trump by three percentage points among likely voters nationally, the latest sign that her campaign's painstaking focus on women, Latinos and blacks could help propel her to the White House. The final Bloomberg Politics national poll before tomorrow's election has the Democrat ahead of Trump, 44 percent to 41 percent, when third-party candidates are included. In a two-way contest, she's also up by three points. Speculation on Clinton's chances helped boost odds of a Federal Reserve interest-rate hike next month. Data compiled by Bloomberg based on fed funds futures trading show an 82 percent probability of higher borrowing costs by year end, up from 76 percent Nov. 4. While riskier assets are climbing, trading patterns around Britain's referendum on European Union membership provide a cautionary tale. A similar rally in stocks, emerging markets and commodities on the day of the U.K. vote gave way to a slump—and a rebound in haven assets—after the unexpected decision in favor of Brexit. The outlier this time around is the dollar, which is strengthening, having weakened before Britain's plebiscite. STOCKS The S&P 500 Index rallied 2.2 percent to close at 2,131.52, erasing its November losses. The Dow Average increased 371.32 points to end the day at 18,259.60. The Nasdaq closed at 5,166.17, up 119.80 points for a 2.4 percent gain. The measure of market turbulence known as the VIX slid 17 percent after surging 39 percent last week. JPMorgan Chase and Microsoft advanced more than 2.8 percent, while Biogen led gains in health care stocks. MSCI's global gauge had climbed 1.5 percent at 12:48 p.m., heading toward the biggest advance since June 29. “We've been down nine straight days as concerns over a potential Trump victory put a lot of caution in the market,” said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. “Some of that is being relieved with the comments from the FBI about the Clinton e-mail investigations.” Regardless of how prices react on Nov. 9, next-day moves in the S&P 500 are useless in telling what comes after. While the index swings an average 1.5 percent the day after the vote, gains or losses over the first 24 hours predict the market's direction 12 months later less than half the time. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index jumped 1.5 percent after posting its 11th consecutive day without gains for the first time since 1994. HSBC Holdings Plc climbed amid a surprise increase in adjusted profit. Glencore and Antofagasta paced a rally in miners. PostNL surged after Belgian mail service Bpost revived its approach to its Dutch counterpart. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rose 1.7 percent in its first increase in five days. Brazil's Ibovespa and Mexico's IPC index led gains among the biggest stock markets. Hungarian shares hit a record high after the country was returned to investment grade by Moody's Investors Service. Egypt's EGX 30 extended an eight-day rally on bets a decision to float the nation's currency will help cement a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. CURRENCIES Mexico's peso posted the biggest advance among major currencies. It has been among assets tending to strengthen when Trump loses momentum as he's pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 10 major counterparts, rose 0.4 percent, following a six-day decline. The greenback advanced 1 percent to $1.1031 per euro, and 1.4 percent to 104.56 yen. The dollar's surge sent it close to the levels likely to prevail if Clinton won the presidential election. The U.S. currency rose as much as 1.5 percent to within 0.6 percent of the 105.25-yen level that the top 10 currency forecasters see it reaching within 24 hours of a Clinton victory. A majority said the dollar would tumble through 100 yen if Trump won. The yuan dropped the most in a month after the central bank weakened the currency's reference rate and the greenback rebounded. BONDS Treasuries led declines among the safest sovereign bonds, with two-year notes falling for the first time in seven days amid speculation that a Clinton win is more likely and therefore will open the way for the Fed to raise interest rates next month. Benchmark 10-year note yields climbed five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.82 percent, set for the biggest increase since Oct. 27, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. “For the Fed, as much as they want to stay out of politics, they're reading the tea leaves to see what happens,” said Michael Franzese, New York-based head of fixed-income trading at MCAP LLC, a broker-dealer. “You would assume if Clinton gets in, it's status quo around the globe. It's definitely two visions.” Bond investors joined traders in currency and stock markets in shifting toward riskier assets as Clinton is seen as a continuity candidate, while her Republican rival is viewed as more unpredictable. Trump, a political novice, has advocated winding back free-trade agreements that have been credited by economists for fueling global growth. German 10-year bunds, perceived to be among the safest debt securities in Europe, slid relative to those of Italy and Spain. Yields on 10-year U.K. gilts rose seven basis points to 1.20 percent. COMMODITIES The Bloomberg Commodity Index rose 0.4 percent, the most since Oct. 27, the day before the FBI e-mail saga was reignited. Gold futures for December delivery slid 1.8 percent to $1,281.60 an ounce at 10:42 a.m. on the Comex in New York, headed for the biggest decline since Oct. 4. Oil traded near $44 a barrel in New York amid a broader market rally and after OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo said Russia, the world's biggest energy producer, is “on board” with an agreement to limit crude production.

Morgan Funds, weigh in on the election and what it could means for the markets.</p> Kimbrough on election: This is just one of several risk events    Monday, 7 Nov 2016 | 1:06 PM ET | 05:18 With investors trying to figure out how to position themselves for the outcome of the U.S. presidential election, two investment experts told CNBC politics shouldn't influence investment thinking. Markets rallied Monday on the eve of the historic vote. Wall Street analysts are predicting an S&P 500 sell-off on a Donald Trump win and believe it will at least hold gains if Hillary Clinton is the victor. However, the election is only one of several risk events that will play out before the end of the year, said Karin Kimbrough, head of macro and economic policy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management. "We also have more on Brexit, more on the Fed decision, more on an Italian referendum and then all the way next year, we expect to see even more uncertainty in the political spectrum in Europe," she told CNBC's "Power Lunch" on Monday. "Think about the long run. Don't focus so much in trying to position around these events. It's too unpredictable," she said. Gabriela Santos, global market strategist for JPMorgan Funds, believes it's a mistake to get in or out of the market based on an election in the U.S. Historically, the market has done well in the medium-term regardless of who is in the White House or what is the makeup of Congress, she said. What the market wants is the least amount of uncertainty possible, and that will likely be true whether it is Trump or Clinton in the Oval Office. "Both are leading with an establishment, Republican-led House. So it's difficult actually for either candidate to get a lot of what they've been proposing through Congress, and as a result we're likely to end up with a government of moderation despite the extreme nature of the election process," Santos told "Power Lunch." show chapters <p>Divided governments and the markets</p> <p>Discussing what impact potential election results could have on the markets and what today&#039;s rally means, with Brian Belski, BMO Capital Markets Chief Investment Strategist, and Richard Bernstein, Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO.</p> Divided governments and the markets    Monday, 7 Nov 2016 | 2:04 PM ET | 03:32 There has already been chatter about possible investigations if Clinton wins, but Rich Bernstein, CEO of Richard Bernstein Advisors and a CNBC contributor, said investors have to remember that Washington, D.C., is a distraction. "One of my very first bosses on Wall Street told me more than 35 years ago that you never take investment advice from Washington," he said. "What you focus on are the fundamentals." To that end, there has been a gradual recovery in corporate profits, he told "Power Lunch." "You have to have the recovery before you get the expansion, and the expansion before the boom," Bernstein said. For Brian Belski, chief investment strategist with BMO Capital Markets, the focus needs to be on revenue growth and earnings growth once the election is over. He thinks in the near-term the markets can go higher into the first half of 2017, but noted that the majority of returns in the bull market have been driven by multiple expansion. "Where is growth going to come from in a scenario where we're still going to have a lot of regulation, and what's going to happen in terms of international growth?" he said in an interview with "Power Lunch." "What's going to incentivize companies to hire, to bring back cash?

 There's a new 'hot-button' issue on Wall Street, and battle lines are being drawn Matt Turner Nov. 3, 2016, 8:34 AM 11,186 facebook linkedin twitter email print Traders working on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid "Information wants to be free," the technology activist Stewart Brand once said. "Information also wants to be expensive." That is proving true on Wall Street, where stock exchanges — in particular the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq — both publicly traded and for-profit, stand accused by rivals and some users of unfairly increasing the price of market data. The debate centers on whether that data is essential — some customers and rivals say it is, the exchanges say otherwise —and whether there is any competition in the market for that data. The big market-makers argue they are in a bind. They say they have to sign up to use the NYSE's and Nasdaq's proprietary depth-of-book feeds and pay for other add-ons, such as having their servers located in exchange data centers. And costs have increased 20% a year for the last five years, according to some estimates. "Exchanges don't create any unique content — market data is generated by their members and other market participants including real investors — so it's very hard to believe that exchanges can perpetually charge their members more every year to look at the members' own data," Brad Katsuyama, CEO of IEX Group, told Business Insider. The exchanges, in contrast, argue that these feeds are optional, that there is competition, and that trading firms can terminate feeds or colocation arrangements if they get too pricey. Earlier this year, a chief administrative law judge at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sided with the exchanges in a long-running legal case focused on the issue. "The SEC judge ruled based on an extensive evidentiary record that the cost of market data is subject to competitive forces," Jeff Kimsey, head of global data products in global information services at Nasdaq, told Business Insider. "Her ruling confirms that competition is real and increases transparency and facilitates access to the best prices." Flickr/Indi Samarajiva Boiling point All of this might sound like a Wall Street issue that lives and dies on trading floors. But a couple of recent developments provide reason to believe that the back-and-forth is about to boil over and go mainstream. The major exchanges are levying a "tax" on the financial community to boost profits, according to IEX, which was approved to be America's newest stock exchange earlier this year. They've used "monopolistic power" to introduce "abusive practices," according to a former SEC commissioner. And they've increased the cost of data to achieve higher valuations, according to the CEO of a big market-making firm. One industry consultant called it "the market data deathmatch" earlier this year in a lengthy report. "If these costs are not reined in, it will almost certainly harm our markets as increased fees will push market-makers to widen quotes and create an increasingly difficult hurdle for brokers, leaving investors with a less liquid and effective market," said the report, from Larry Tabb, founder of the Tabb Group. It has even started coming up on earnings calls. On Tuesday October 1, Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill, asked Jeff Sprecher, chairman and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, the group that owns the New York Stock Exchange, whether he was noticing "a little drum beat of pushback" on the increased pricing of market data. "It's always interesting to us that a lot of the people that try to benefit from fragmentation of markets then complain about the fact that it costs them more to do business in that fragmentation that they helped create," Sprecher said. The upstarts IEX and Bats Global Markets, the exchange group that's set to be acquired by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, have emerged as vocal critics of the establishment exchanges. IEX has asked for more transparency on NYSE's market data and access fees, saying the charges for colocation and market data represent a "tax" and that "exchanges have an outsized influence on constantly rising trading costs." And Bats urged the regulator to reject a Nasdaq proposal for a new network to carry data feeds. To be clear, Bats also charges for data, and has said it would look to boost these kinds of revenues. IEX will "never need to rely on charging for market data and connectivity," Katsuyama said. Big trading firms are starting to go public with their dissatisfaction with rising costs, asking the regulator to step in. "If you think about the improvements in technology and cost of information and how that has come down, this is the one industry that has gone the other way," Doug Cifu, chief executive of the high-speed trading firm Virtu, told Business Insider. Muhammad Ali, world heavyweight champion. AP Photo/Jess Tan "My take is that there have been some abusive practices — the fluctuation, the arbitrariness with which fees have been jacked up, and the monopolistic power that goes behind it — there is a problem," Dan Gallagher, an SEC commissioner until 2015 who is now president of the consultant Patomak Global Partners, told Business Insider. A bit of history In 1975, amendments to the Exchange Act introduced what are called Securities Information Processors, or SIPs, which were designed to be central, consolidated live streams of every exchange's best quotes. In the late '90s and early '00s, regulators introduced new rules that sought to increase competition among exchanges and reduce trading costs. Price quotes went from being in fractions — the smallest increment was once one-sixteenth of a dollar, or a teenie — to decimals in 2001. The switch aided automated and high-frequency trading, which took off in a big way. More electronic exchanges were set up. The market fragmented. Around the same time, the major stock exchanges such as the NYSE and Nasdaq, which had been not-for-profit and member-owned, went public, creating a profit imperative.  Exchanges are banned from providing data directly to customers before providing the same data to the plan processors for the consolidated live stream. However, the trading center data feeds still gets the information to clients quicker, as the data doesn't have to go through an extra step of consolidation. Selling this proprietary data that competed with the SIP created a two-tier market for data. Brett Redfearn, a JPMorgan trading executive, told the SEC in 2015: "Unlike SIPs, 100% of the revenues from competing, proprietary market data products go to the exchanges selling that data. These proprietary data products are far superior to the product produced by the SIPs, such that broker-dealers — including my firm — must purchase these proprietary data feeds from exchanges to provide competitive trading products for our clients. "The latency issues associated with the SIP are today so well known that, for broker-dealers providing electronic trading products, 'using the SIP' is considered uncompetitive. In client meetings, it is imperative that we reiterate that we use direct feeds." The need to be signed up for better-quality proprietary direct feeds from the exchanges put the likes of the NYSE and Nasdaq in a position where, critics argue, they're able to increase the costs of the proprietary data. Data and technology revenues have increased 62% in recent years, while transactional revenues are up 5%. Tabb Group "If you are placing quotes with the exchange, you need the depth-of-book data," Michael Friedman, general counsel at the digital-trading firm Trillium, told Business Insider. "It is irresponsible to not have it." Katsuyama echoed this sentiment. "The exchanges know that SIP feeds will never match the proprietary feeds in utility and speed, so the idea that there is 'choice' in the market is a sham," he said. "There is no choice — you have to pay the exchanges what they charge." The why The decision to try and monetize market data is a natural reaction to the process of going public and the rapid digitization of stock trading, according to some. "The cost of trading has gone down, and trading has become more fragmented," a top industry stock analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of his relationship with the exchanges, told Business Insider. "It has increased the value of data, which comes at a price. Some people would say they are price-gouging, but there is greater value for this data." In particular, the reduction in trading costs eroded transactional profits, encouraging a shift from a commission-based revenue model to one based on subscriptions. What this means in practice is that instead of making money from a trade being executed on an exchange, exchanges make money from charging people a monthly fee to see the data that trade creates. According to data from Tabb Group, data and technology revenues have increased 62% in recent years, while transactional revenues are up just 5%. And Nasdaq noted in a September presentation that 75% of its 2015 revenue was "subscription and recurring." Data product revenues have increased at Nasdaq. Nasdaq Revenues from data products — "primarily proprietary information from Nasdaq's trading markets, and also includes shared revenues from industrywide US equities 'tape plan'" — was forecast to stand at $413 million in 2016, up from $327 million in 2011. The operating margin for the information services business, which includes data products and index licensing and services revenue, was around 70% in 2015. Don Ross, CEO at the US equity trading firm PDQ Enterprises, previously worked at the high-speed trading firm Getco, which is now part of KCG. He said: "When the Getcos of the world took over the market-making business, we reduced the cost of the round-lot. The spread went down by an order of magnitude, and we were able to do that with many less people. That put the revenue in the hands of the electronic market-makers, and so the exchanges realized they could up the subscription price. They could raise the badge prices. You don't need to be on the floor, but you do need to colocate and get a direct feed." This shift from commission revenue to subscription revenue is reflected in how the exchanges are valued. Wall Street investors typically put a premium on stable, recurring, subscriptionlike revenues over more episodic volatile earnings. "The elephant in the room is that Wall Street rewards subscription-based business rather than transaction-based business," Cifu said. That has people angry This process of finding new ways to make money from data isn't new — in fact, it has been happening for years. Every so often, according to critics, the exchanges would introduce a new charge or up an existing charge. "It is dribs and drabs," Friedman said. "You get, once a year, some proposal that changes some technical line system, and the net effect is that goes from paying them $50,000 a month to $52,000." In years gone by, when business was better, the industry might have accepted this. But now, in a more difficult environment where industry profits are under pressure, there is greater focus on all kinds of costs. "Several years ago, these fees were a lot smaller," said a senior executive at a top trading firm, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the potential of damaging his relationship with the exchanges. "In the heyday, when volumes and volatility were high, everyone is making money, you don't look at cost so much. When they struggle, they look at expenses and say 'What the heck?'" He added that he estimates that the cost of data had increased 20% or more a year for the last five years. This is in stark contrast to the cost of information in other fields, according to Cifu and others. Brad Katsuyama, CEO of IEX Group. Thomson Reuters Cifu said that US equities, as a percentage of Virtu's total spend, is the most expensive asset class his firm trades in. "It is totally out of control," he said. It isn't just high-speed traders who are feeling the pinch. Mike Savino is the vice president for operations at M1 Finance, a Chicago-based startup roboadviser. He told Business Insider that it costs his firm $10,000 a month just to license the data — more than any other cost but personnel. "We execute tens of thousands trades a month, but that cost of accessing data is more than execution and clearing," he said. "I would be pro democratizing the data, pushing it out to users at a lower cost," he added. "If the louder voices can make the change for everyone, with the new exchanges out there, it could become a more competitive marketplace." So what now? To be sure, all those complaining about the cost of market data are representing their own interests. IEX and Bats compete with NYSE and Nasdaq, and have sought to establish themselves as alternatives to the establishment exchanges. And the big trading firms are looking to boost their own profits. Finding a way to cut the cost of market data is one way to do that. While data product revenues have gone up, they're still far from the entire exchange profit pool. Nasdaq's estimated $413 million in data products revenue compares with more than $2 billion in total revenue, for example. In addition, the cost of trading is still down dramatically from what it was 20 years ago. And the exchanges argue that the cost of data is going down. It is just that some people are buying more of it.  "One point that that group that is spending more and more on data doesn't recognize is that the actual cost of data is plummeting," Sprecher said on the earnings call earlier this week. "There is just the fact that people are buying more lower cost, declining cost information. And so the spend for many of these people is voluntary." Still, the stage has been set for for a royal rumble on Wall Street, with the exchanges on one side and some of the big trading firms on the other. "There are enough people in the industry, it is like the moment in 'Network' where they say 'We're mad as hell,'" Cifu said. "But I don't know what we're going to do about it." One possibility is that the SIP gets an upgrade, either through investment or a governance change, making it more competitive with the proprietary data feeds. This is something Adam Nunes, head of business development at Hudson River Trading, has argued for. Steps in this direction are underway. In late October, part of the SIP migrated to a new system that reduced the latency (think increased speed) by 95%, with the median latency decreasing from 500 microseconds to less than 20. Another route toward change is through the courts. In 2006, the NYSE acquired Arca and starting charging for depth-of-book data that had previously been free, a move that was approved by the SEC. NetCoalition — a trade association including Yahoo, Google, and Bloomberg — and the finance trade body Simfa joined forces in 2008 and filed suit seeking to set aside the SEC order approving the increase in fees. That legal battle has worked its way through the courts, with the latest petition rejected in June. Thomson Reuters "The Exchanges have presented persuasive evidence establishing that their ability to price their depth-of-book products is constantly under pressure from their biggest customers, and those customers' ability to control order flow," Brenda Murray, a chief administrative law judge, wrote in her decision. "That is enough." Simfa and NetCoalition submitted their opening brief to appeal that decision in September, and the exchanges are due to reply next week. Oral arguments are due to be heard in 2017. "Everyone likes the Simfa lawsuit as the way to solve this because that way it is in the hands of a judge rather than someone who has to go and have breakfast the next day with the other side," Friedman said. Then there's the possibility that the SEC or Congress would decide to intervene. At present, the SEC controls the pricing of the SIP, and while exchanges submit data and infrastructure pricing, these are always accepted. "When an exchange, which has a license from the government and has a pseudo-monopoly, files with the SEC to add a charge, what is the government's role?" Cifu said. "It is to rubber-stamp it? Or do they say 'We need more info if this fair and reasonable charge?'" IEX has asked for more transparency on the makeup of the charges. That request, and Bats' decision to weigh against Nasdaq's proposals, could have a meaningful effect. "If you have an exchange calling for reform, it really changes the debate in a big way," Gallagher said. He added that he could see this becoming "a massive hot-button issue." Chris Concannon, president and CEO of Bats Global Markets. REUTERS/Mike Segar "It is the entrance of IEX, the Bats movement — that is what the commission has never dealt with," Gallagher said. "The commission has always faced a united front supporting the status quo. It was always black and white. Now there are shades of gray, and I think it is fascinating." Then there is the possibility that things stay as they are. Tabb, who earlier in the year penned a Bloomberg View column titled Stock Exchanges Are Eating Your Returns, said: "I think we're stuck with the status quo unless the whole industry yells so loud that they force Congress to do something." Whatever happens next, the ongoing war of words is further evidence of how stock trading has fundamentally changed. Gone are the days when you could buy a place on the floor. Now you buy a place in the data center. "The floor of NYSE doesn't exist," Cifu said. "It is in Mahwah, New Jersey. Now you can pay to be a floor trader, which is to say you can be in the data center. It has democratized the trading floor. Anyone can be there. But there is zero alternative for a market-making firm but to be in there." NOW WATCH: These are the business skills you learn from being in a gang Loading video...

Starting next year, Chase Pay will become the first third-party digital wallet on Wal-Mart's website and app, they said on Thursday. Customers can pay within the app with any major credit, debit, pre-paid or Walmart gift card. Daniel Eckert, senior vice-president of services at Wal-Mart U.S., said in an interview late on Friday that the retailer would tweak its marketing for the app after the most frequent users turned out to be Gen X customers, born from 1965 to 1967, and baby boomers born from 1946 to 1964. "The target demographic during the launch of a technology product tends to be younger, more male, so we have had that target market in mind," Eckert said. U.S. mobile payments accounted for an estimated $67 billion in 2015, and are expected to grow this year to $83 billion, or 24 percent of all purchases made via smartphones, according to the latest Forrester Research data. Apple Inc's Apple Pay or Alphabet Inc's Android Pay are the most popular digital wallets, and U.S. retailers have launched many mobile payment apps in the last two years. But acceptance has been slow, largely because most systems require new equipment at stores. Wal-Mart Pay was launched in December 2015 and can be used in all of the retailer's 4,600 U.S. stores. Customers at the checkout counter must choose the payment option within the app on their smartphone, and activate the camera to scan the code at the register. An e-receipt is sent to the app. Eckert also said more than 90 percent of transactions on the app involve customers are using the service more than three to four times a month. He declined to give the overall number of users who use Wal-Mart Pay. Wal-Mart leads a consortium of U.S. retailers developing a mobile wallet app called CurrentC. The group, which includes Target Corp and Best Buy Co Inc, said earlier this year it would delay launching the app after the project hit several roadblocks.

News Stocks rise, Treasuries fall with gold as Clinton gets FBI boost Rita Nazareth and Eddie van Der Walt, (c) 2016, Bloomberg News(c) 2016, Bloomberg News Global stocks rallied with commodities and Mexico's peso on speculation Hillary Clinton's chances of a U.S. election victory increased after the FBI said her handling of e-mails wasn't a crime. Demand for haven assets waned, with high-quality government bonds, the yen and gold retreating. The MSCI All Country World index posted its biggest gain since June, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 370 points and emerging-market shares surged as Clinton is seen by investors as the more predictable candidate. The peso jumped the most among major currencies, and a rally in the dollar versus the yen showed prices close to fully reflecting a Democrat win. Oil and metals paced gains in materials, while gold sank with Treasuries. Relief swept over markets around the world just before the Nov. 8 vote as FBI director James Comey said Sunday that the agency kept its July conclusion and wouldn't recommend criminal charges against Clinton. Traders had been on edge since the bureau announced Oct. 28 it reopened a probe into her use of an unauthorized e-mail server. The Democrat is seen as a continuity candidate, while Republican contender Donald Trump is a political novice who has advocated winding back free-trade agreements. "There's a restrained global relief," said Piet Lammens, head of research at KBC Bank in Brussels. "The market reacted to the message that they started the investigation and now they have to do the opposite. However, we are just one day before the election and it would be imprudent to take big positions and think everything is OK." Clinton is leading Trump by three percentage points among likely voters nationally, the latest sign that her campaign's painstaking focus on women, Latinos and blacks could help propel her to the White House. The final Bloomberg Politics national poll before Tuesday's election has the Democrat ahead of Trump, 44 percent to 41 percent, when third-party candidates are included. In a two-way contest, she's also up by three points. Speculation on Clinton's chances helped boost odds of a Federal Reserve interest-rate hike next month. Data compiled by Bloomberg based on fed funds futures trading show an 82 percent probability of higher borrowing costs by year end, up from 76 percent on Friday. While riskier assets are climbing before the U.S. election, trading patterns around Britain's referendum on European Union membership provide a cautionary tale. A similar rally in stocks, emerging markets and commodities on the day of the U.K. vote gave way to a slump -- and a rebound in haven assets -- after the unexpected decision in favor of Brexit. The outlier this time around is the dollar, which is strengthening, having weakened before Britain's plebiscite. --- MSCI's global gauge climbed 1.6 percent at 4 p.m. in New York, the biggest advance since June 29. The S&amp;P 500 index rallied 2.2 percent to 2,131.37, erasing its November losses. The measure of market turbulence known as the VIX slid 16 percent after surging 39 percent last week. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. and Microsoft advanced more than 2.9 percent, while Biogen led gains in health-care stocks. "We've been down nine straight days as concerns over a potential Trump victory put a lot of caution in the market," said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. "Some of that is being relieved with the comments from the FBI about the Clinton e-mail investigations." Regardless of how prices react on Nov. 9, next-day moves in the S&amp;P 500 are useless in telling what comes after. While the index swings an average 1.5 percent the day after the vote, gains or losses over the first 24 hours predict the market's direction 12 months later less than half the time. The Stoxx Europe 600 index jumped 1.5 percent after posting its 11th consecutive day without gains for the first time since 1994. HSBC Holdings climbed amid a surprise increase in adjusted profit. Glencore and Antofagasta paced a rally in miners. PostNL surged after Belgian mail service Bpost revived its approach to its Dutch counterpart. The MSCI Emerging Markets index rose 1.8 percent in its first increase in five days. Brazil's Ibovespa and Mexico's IPC index led gains among the biggest stock markets. Hungarian shares hit a record high after the country was returned to investment grade by Moody's Investors Service. Egypt's EGX 30 extended an eight-day rally on bets a decision to float the nation's currency will help cement a $12 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund. --- Mexico's peso posted the biggest advance among major currencies. It has been among assets tending to strengthen when Trump loses momentum as he's pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement and build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 10 major counterparts, rose 0.4 percent, following a six-day decline. The greenback advanced 1 percent to $1.1031 per euro, and 1.4 percent to 104.56 yen. The dollar's surge sent the greenback close to the levels likely to prevail if Clinton won the presidential election. The U.S. currency rose as much as 1.5 percent to within 0.6 percent of the 105.25-yen level that the top 10 currency forecasters see it reaching within 24 hours of a Clinton victory. A majority said the dollar would tumble through 100 yen if Trump won. "Our base case is that Clinton wins and the dollar strengthens" into the Federal Reserve meeting in December, said Robert Rennie, head of financial-markets strategy in Sydney at Westpac Banking. He sees the dollar at 105 should Clinton win. "Clearly, markets appear to have embraced that view today." The yuan dropped the most in a month after the central bank weakened the currency's reference rate and the greenback rebounded. --- Treasuries led declines among the safest sovereign bonds, with two-year notes falling for the first time in seven days amid speculation that a Clinton win is more likely and therefore will open the way for the Fed to raise interest rates next month. Benchmark 10-year note yields climbed five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.82 percent, set for the biggest increase since Oct. 27, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. "For the Fed, as much as they want to stay out of politics, they're reading the tea leaves to see what happens," said Michael Franzese, New York-based head of fixed-income trading at MCAP, a broker-dealer. "You would assume if Clinton gets in, it's status quo around the globe. It's definitely two visions." German 10-year bunds, perceived to be among the safest debt securities in Europe, slid relative to those of Italy and Spain. Yields on 10-year U.K. gilts rose seven basis points to 1.20 percent. --- The Bloomberg Commodity index rose 0.6 percent, the most since Oct. 27, the day before the FBI e-mail saga was reignited. Gold futures for December delivery slid 1.9 percent to settle at $1,279.40 an ounce at 1:41 p.m. on the Comex in New York, the biggest decline since Oct. 4. Oil rebounded amid a broader market rally and after OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo said Russia, the world's biggest energy producer, is "on board" with an agreement to limit crude production. "The U.S. election is front and center in all the markets," said Chris Kettenmann, chief energy strategist at Macro Risk Advisors in New York. "There was talk over the weekend of Russia agreeing to limit production in cooperation with OPEC, but we need to see a resolution from the Nov. 8 vote before the focus shifts to Nov. 30." West Texas Intermediate for December delivery climbed 1.9 percent to $44.89 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent for January settlement rose 1.3 percent to $46.15 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. --- With assistance from James Herron, Anooja Debnath, Martin Ritchie, Netty Ismail, Lukanyo Mnyanda, Richard Frost, Neil Denslow, Emma O'Brien, Lilian Karunungan, James Regan, Alan Soughley ,Andrea Wong, Stephen Kirkland, Joseph Ciolli, Rachel Morison, Narayanan Somasundaram and Oliver Renick Copyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune Breaking Sports Trending Opinion Suburbs Entertainment Business Advertising 47°

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig) (Seth Wenig) Print Email Jennifer Larino, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune By Jennifer Larino, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune The Times-Picayune Email the author | Follow on Twitter on November 07, 2016 at 2:05 PM comments Worried about how the results of Tuesday's presidential election will affect the stock market? So are American banks. Reuters reports JP Morgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group are among institutions preparing for volatility in the financial markets in the wake of the election. The report notes the preparations appear to reflect lessons learned after Britain's market-rattling vote to leave the European Union back in June. Among other directives, banks are warning staff to think about using so-called stop-loss orders, an automated trading mechanism that instantaneously sells an investor's stock as soon as prices hit a certain level, the report says. Stocks rose Monday (Nov. 7) after the FBI said again it would not pursue criminal charges related to Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, the report says. Experts predict stock prices could swing 2 percent in either direction Wednesday depending on the election's outcome, with prices expected to drop if Republican Donald Trump wins. Reuters notes investors have viewed Clinton as "a more status quo candidate." Read the full Reuters report.

Wells Fargo is eligible for up to $1.5 billion in bailout funds over the next seven years. JPMorgan and Bank of America could receive $1.1 billion and $964 million respectively. The continuous flow of funds is a remnant of the $700 bailout effort, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP, put in place during the financial crisis. Some of that money, about $28 million, was carved out to help distressed homeowners by paying banks to lower their interest rates and monthly payments. The program, the Home Affordable Modification Program, has undergone several revamps over the last few years and fallen short of helping the 3 million to 4 million homeowners the Obama administration initially hoped. But it continues to operate — HAMP will accept its last homeowner application at the end of this year — and big banks continue to be paid for helping. Advertisement Continue reading The stream of cash for the big banks is worrisome to Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or SIGTARP, the chief watchdog of the financial crisis-era bailouts. Many of the banks have repeatedly broken the rules of the program, including kicking homeowners out unfairly or making it too difficult to apply for the help. “Why are we paying for nonperformance?…At what point is somebody is going to say enough and is enough?” said Christy Goldsmith Romero, special inspector general with the Troubled Asset Relief Program, who investigates crime at companies that received taxpayer bailout funds. “If a homeowner doesn’t follow the rules in HAMP they get knocked out of the program. If a bank doesn’t follow they still get paid by Treasury.” The banks and the Treasury Department, which oversees HAMP, defend the program. The “error rates” have fallen significantly, Mark McArdle, deputy assistant secretary for financial stability, said in a statement. The SIGTARP report is “inaccurate,” Wells Fargo said in a statement. “We respond quickly to correct any errors we identify or that are brought to our attention.” Bank of America said it has helped more than 2.1 million customers avoid foreclosure through HAMP and other programs. “These initiatives continue to help those who face financial difficulty today, even as the economy has recovered overall,” the bank said in a statement. JPMorgan, which has more than $2 trillion in assets, says most of the money it receives through the program is passed on to investors and homeowners who receive incentives for paying their mortgages on time. The biggest beneficiary of the housing program, by far, is little-known financial company Ocwen. The Atlanta company services millions of mortgages for investors, including collecting payments from homeowners. It has already received $2.9 billion from the HAMP program and over the next seven years, it could receive $2.6 billion more. “We are extremely proud of our performance and our success in helping struggling borrowers remain in their homes,” Ocwen said in a statement. bailout Share Tweet LinkedIn Print Subscribe More News Suggested Stories: Rep.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:00 AM, November 8, 2016 Updated: 5:30 AM, November 8, 2016 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether big banks have been mishandling securities in the American Depositary Receipt (ADR) market, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. The SEC has sent subpoenas to four banks over the issue - Bank of New York Mellon Corp <BK.N>, Citigroup Inc <C.N>, Deutsche Bank AG <DBKGn.DE> <DB.N> and JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N>, the Journal reported, citing people close to the matter. (http://on.wsj.com/2eFTBJ4) The probe, which is looking at whether the banks have broken controls designed to prevent market abuse and tax fraud, will not necessarily result in enforcement action, the report said. A major focus of the SEC inquiry is the "pre-release" of ADRs, where banks issue depositary receipts to investors without first having the underlying shares in their custody, the Journal reported. That means the shares could be sold short without actually having them - a practice known as "naked short selling", which is illegal. ADRs represent shares of foreign companies that are held in custody by U.S. banks. Trading in ADRs rather than the underlying shares reduces administration and trading costs, both for companies and for investors. Deutsche Bank and Citigroup declined to comment on the report, while the other two banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

CBS News' Nancy Cordes looks at the possible political impact of the FBI's decision to once again clear Hillary Clinton in the private email serv... Investors have been anxious in recent weeks over signs that the U.S. presidential race was tightening. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index is coming off its longest losing streak since 1980. Monday’s surge erased more than half of those losses.       Banks and health care companies rose more than the rest of the market. UnitedHealth and JPMorgan Chase led the Dow higher. Clinton got a boost late Sunday, when FBI Director James Comey told lawmakers that a review of new emails from the Democratic candidate did not change the bureau’s recommendation that she should not face charges. The market fell on Oct. 28 after the FBI notified Congress that it was reviewing newly discovered emails linked to Clinton, who is seen by Wall Street as likely to maintain the status quo. Donald Trump’s policies are less clear, and the uncertainty and uncomfortable closeness of the polls caused jitters in financial markets ahead of Tuesday’s general election. The VIX, a measure of how much volatility investors expect to see in the market over the next 30 days, slumped 17.5 percent Monday after surging 40 percent last week to its highest level since June, when Britain voted to leave the European Union. The slide in the VIX reflected less anxiety among investors. Safe haven investments also slumped as investors felt comfortable taking on more risk. Bond prices fell, driving the yield on the 10-year Treasury note up to 1.82 percent from 1.78 percent late Friday, while the price of gold fell $23.60, or 1.8 percent, to $1,281 an ounce. Utilities and phone stocks, two other havens investors seek when they expect turmoil, lagged the market. U.S. benchmark crude oil was up 25 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $44.32 a barrel in New York. The price of oil is coming off a six-day losing streak. Brent crude, which is used to price international oils, was up 6 cents at $45.64 a barrel in London. The dollar strengthened across the board. It was up to 104.57 yen from 103.13 on Friday. The dollar was down 2.2 percent to 18.61 Mexican pesos from 19.03 pesos. The Mexican currency has become an indirect proxy among investors for Trump’s chances to win the White House. Investors have speculated that a Trump administration would be negative for the Mexican economy, and would cause the Mexican peso’s value to fall as a result. © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

James Rickards says exchanges may be locked down during the next crisis (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) James Rickards has predicted major changes in financial markets, and his latest prediction is his biggest yet. A lawyer, portfolio manager, government adviser, and lecturer, Rickards has foreseen changes like competitive currency devaluation, the rise of gold, and the plan to replace the dollar as the world’s reserve currency, as written in his bestselling books “Currency Wars,” “The Death of Money,” and “The New Case For Gold.” Epoch Times spoke to Rickards about his new book, “The Road to Ruin: The Global Elites’ Secret Plan for the Next Financial Crisis,” and about central banks’ inability to stop the next financial crisis, as well as a possible financial market lock down. Epoch Times: Why will the next crisis be worse than the last one? James Rickards: To analyze that, I use the two prior crises: the 1998 Long-Term Capital Management crisis and the 2008 banking crisis. In 1998, I was a participant [in the crisis] as the general counsel of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management. I negotiated that bailout. We could see we were just hours away from the closure of every market in the world—that’s not an exaggeration. The markets didn’t collapse in the end, but it came extremely close. In 2008, it was the same thing—we were days away from the sequential collapse of every bank in the world. Bear Stearns collapsed in March 2008. Then Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taken over by the government in early September and Lehman Brothers went bankrupt later in September that year. They were falling like dominoes, and they all would have fallen: Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase. Best-selling author James Rickards argues in “The Road To Ruin” that central banks are tapped out, almost guaranteeing the next financial crisis will be larger than what came before. (Courtesy of James Rickards) But then the Federal Reserve truncated the process. They dropped a steel wall between the dominoes so the next one would not fall. But that’s not a cost-free exercise. It’s like stopping an earthquake right in the middle and not letting it finish; it doesn’t really solve anything. An earthquake is just a release of energy. So that energy would just be stored up, and it will be a worse earthquake the next time. In financial markets, it’s the same. Each crisis is bigger than the one before, each bailout is bigger than the one before. Just as 2008 was worse than 1998, the next crisis, whether it’s in 2018 or sooner, will be bigger and worse than the ones before. Central Banks Are ‘Tapped Out’ Epoch Times: And you say central banks won’t be able to handle it this time? Mr. Rickards: The central banks won’t be able to stop it. In 1998, Wall Street bailed out a hedge fund; in 2008, the central banks bailed out Wall Street. In 2018 or sooner, who is going to bail out the central banks? The central banks are tapped out. The Fed is leveraged 113 to 1. On a bad day, it is technically insolvent on a mark-to-market basis. Not every day, but on certain days in the last five years, if you had marked the Fed’s balance sheet to market, they were insolvent, their liabilities were greater than their assets, and their capital would have been wiped out. I believe that there is a visible confidence boundary that you pass. You won’t know where it is until it is too late. You will find out the hard way that you destroyed confidence in your money and then you won’t be able to get it back. The only clean balance sheet left, the only entity that can pull money out of thin air, is the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It’s the central bank of the world. They can print the world money, the Special Drawing Rights (SDR) currency, to re-liquefy the system. Epoch Times: But not without closing banks and financial markets? Mr. Rickards: It will take the IMF some period of time—I would estimate a minimum of three to six months—to issue the SDRs and to get the money out there. In the meantime, the panic will begin, and the national authorities will work together to lock down the system. They are going to have to close banks; money market funds are going to suspend redemptions; and stock exchanges will be closed. People won’t be allowed to get their money for at least some time, until this new money is created. So it will be worse, more dramatic, larger. People will lose more, suffer more. All I’m trying to do is explain these dynamics in my new book “The Road to Ruin” and give people a warning and some options to preserve their wealth. I am warning people that they are not going to get their money when they expect, but at some point, [the authorities] will come up with an SDR solution and they will gradually reopen the exchanges. Global Plan Epoch Times: But you also say the global elites, including the IMF, would like the SDR to be global reserve currency, with or without a crisis. What is the evidence? Mr. Rickards: We have had some landmarks recently regarding the SDR. On Oct. 1, the Chinese yuan was included in the SDR reference basket. It’s not even close to being a reserve currency, but they bent the rules for political purposes. They can see the crisis coming; they see they will have to bail out the world, and they will need China’s vote. There is no way you could do something like that without China’s approval. China says, “Why should we approve something like that if we are not part of the SDR?” So they included the yuan in the basket. In July, the IMF issued a technical paper calling for the market-based use of the SDR. The IMF was encouraging the creation of a private SDR market. Then the World Bank came out and issued $2.8 billion worth of SDR bonds in September. And there is another issue coming by Standard Chartered Bank. It’s important because if countries use the SDR, they need investable assets. Just the other day, the IMF issued a call to a group of experts and academics to form a working group to comment on the expansion of the SDR market. So all these things are underway, and if left to their own devices, it might take another 10 or 15 years. But what I expect will happen is that the crisis will come before the lead plan for SDR is fully realized. So they will have to issue the SDRs on an emergency basis to re-liquefy the world, and everything that they are talking about will be accelerated, compressed into a shorter period of time, and then we will have an SDR reference system before we know it. That will involve pricing oil in SDRs, and oil contract settlement and payments in SDRs. That said, dollars will still be around; we will still have dollars, but it will be like a local currency if you will, like the Mexican peso, or Turkish lira, or any other local currency. Epoch Times: What can people do to protect themselves? Mr. Rickards: I think gold wins either way. There is not a central bank in the world that wants the gold standard, but they may have no choice. They may have to go to a gold standard to restore confidence. The other scenario is that somehow this SDR plan works and you get inflation. Then the gold price will go up because of the inflation. If the SDRs works, gold goes up because of inflation. And if the SDR fails and you turn to gold to restore confidence, gold goes up because it has to support the money supply.

The SEC has sent subpoenas to four banks over the issue - Bank of New York Mellon Corp , Citigroup Inc , Deutsche Bank AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co , the Journal reported, citing people close to the matter. (http://on.wsj.com/2eFTBJ4) The probe, which is looking at whether the banks have broken controls designed to prevent market abuse and tax fraud, will not necessarily result in enforcement action, the report said. ADRs represent shares of foreign companies that are held in custody by U.S. banks. Trading in ADRs rather than the underlying shares reduces administration and trading costs, both for companies and for investors. Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the report while the other three banks did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Bank preparations ahead of the U.S. election reflect their experience following Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union in June, when the S&P 500 fell 3.6 percent the day after the poll. Morgan Stanley told staff to consider using stop-loss orders, an automated trading mechanism that is meant to sell an investor's position as soon as a stock hits a preset level, if the election result causes trading volumes and volatility to spike. The bank also told advisers in its wealth management unit to prepare for election-related conversations with clients and pointed them to relevant pieces of research, according to a November 7 memo reviewed by Reuters. Traders expect U.S. stock prices to swing by about 2 percent in either direction on Wednesday, the day after the election, based on the price of S&P 500 index options. Options on the PowerShares QQQ Trust Russell 2000 ETF, are pricing similarly large swings before the week is out. Some banks are projecting a more extreme drop in the event of a victory for Republican Donald Trump, with Citigroup estimating that a Trump victory could trigger a 3-5 percent sell-off for the S&P 500. U.S. stocks rose on Monday as Democrat Hillary Clinton's prospects brightened after the FBI said it would not press criminal charges related to her use of a private email server. Investors have tended to see Clinton as a more status quo candidate, while Trump's stances on foreign policy, trade and immigration have unnerved the market. After the election, Morgan Stanley will hold a call for financial advisers and clients with Chief Investment Officer Mike Wilson on Wednesday morning. Goldman Sachs is also hosting a call for its private wealth clients led by Chief Investment Officer Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani and members of Washington lobbying groups Elmendorf Ryan and CGCN Group, according to an invitation sent to clients. More than half of the stock and bond fund managers polled by Northern Trust in the third quarter said they expected the election to cause a large increase in market volatility. On Tuesday night, when results begin to come in, JPMorgan will have additional traders on duty in New York to back up its Asian trading teams in case of surges in volume, said bank spokesman Brian Marchiony. The extra staffing is similar to what the bank did during Britain's vote to leave the European Union, he said. On Wednesday morning, JPMorgan will hold conference calls to discuss the election results and investment implications with customers, including private banking clients, investment managers and institutional clients. A Citigroup spokeswoman described similar plans, including overnight staff in New York on the trading floor.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Renae Merle November 7 Follow @renaemerle Thousands of workers and union members gather for a rally and a march on Wall Streetin 2010 to protest lost jobs and the taxpayer-funded bailout of banks. (Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images) NEW YORK -- Eight-years after taxpayers rescued the U.S. financial system, some of the country's largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, continue to receive billions in bailout money, according to government data. Wells Fargo is eligible for up to $1.5 billion in bailout funds over the next seven years. JPMorgan and Bank of America could receive $1.1 billion and $964 million respectively. The continuous flow of funds is a remnant of the $700 billion bailout effort, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP, put in place during the financial crisis. Some of that money, about $28 billion, was carved out to help distressed homeowners by paying banks to lower their interest rates and monthly payments. The program, the Home Affordable Modification Program, has undergone several revamps over the last few years and fallen short of helping the 3 million to 4 million homeowners the Obama administration initially hoped. But it continues to operate -- HAMP will accept its last homeowner application at the end of this year -- and big banks continue to be paid based on how many homeowners they help. At least the money being paid to the banks is making it more likely that homeowners will qualify for help with their mortgages, said Alys Cohen, staff attorney for National Consumer Law Center.  “To some extent, companies are being paid for what they should have been doing anyway,” said Cohen. “A large portion of the bailout money didn’t go to helping individuals or communities, but this money does.” But the stream of cash for the big banks is worrisome to Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or SIGTARP, the chief watchdog of the financial crisis-era bailouts. Many of the banks have repeatedly broken the rules of the program, including kicking homeowners out unfairly or making it too difficult to apply for the help. [This obscure government agency has a plan to put Wall Street CEOs in prison] “Why are we paying for nonperformance?...At what point is somebody going to say enough is enough?” said Christy Goldsmith Romero, special inspector general with the Troubled Asset Relief Program, who investigates crime at companies that received taxpayer bailout funds. “If a homeowner doesn’t follow the rules in HAMP they get knocked out of the program. If a bank doesn’t follow they still get paid by Treasury.” The banks and the Treasury Department, which oversees HAMP, defend the program. The "error rates" have fallen significantly, Mark McArdle, deputy assistant secretary for financial stability, said in a statement. Companies are required to fix any problems detected and “TARP funds are recovered as appropriate,” the Treasury Department said in a letter responding to SIGTARP’s critique. “We also have withheld financial incentives from servicers that performed poorly until they made specified improvements,” the letter said. The SIGTARP report is "inaccurate," Wells Fargo said in a statement. "We respond quickly to correct any errors we identify or that are brought to our attention." Bank of America said it has helped more than 2.1 million customers avoid foreclosure through HAMP and other programs. "These initiatives continue to help those who face financial difficulty today, even as the economy has recovered overall," the bank said in a statement. JPMorgan, which has more than $2 trillion in assets, says most of the money it receives through the program is passed on to investors and homeowners who receive incentives for paying their mortgages on time. The biggest beneficiary of the housing program, by far, is little-known financial company Ocwen. The Florida company services millions of mortgages for investors, including collecting payments from homeowners. It has already received $2.9 billion from the HAMP program and over the next seven years, it could receive $2.6 billion more. "We are extremely proud of our performance and our success in helping struggling borrowers remain in their homes," Ocwen said in a statement. business wonkblog true Please provide a valid email address.

With the strong upward move, the major averages are regaining ground after ending last Friday's trading at their lowest closing levels in about four months. Currently, the major averages are at their best levels of the day. The Dow is up 343.31 points or 1.9 percent at 18,231.59, the Nasdaq is up 121.05 points or 2.4 percent at 5,167.42 and the S&P 500 is up 43.52 points or 2.1 percent at 2,128.70. The rebound on Wall Street comes on the heels of news the FBI has once again cleared Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton of criminal charges related to her use of a private email server while Secretary of State. "Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton," FBI Director James Comey wrote in a letter sent to members of Congress on Sunday. Late last month, Comey revealed that the FBI re-opened its probe of Clinton after learning of the existence of new emails on a device obtained in connection with an unrelated investigation. U.S. officials familiar with the case told the Washington Post the new emails were either personal or duplicative of those found earlier. The news that Clinton has been cleared for a second time is seen as boosting her chances of emerging victorious on Election Day on Tuesday, which could be a positive for stocks. JPMorgan analysts predicted the S&P 500 would jump by 3 percent from last Friday's close if Clinton wins the election. Sector News Electronic storage stocks continue to see substantial strength in mid-day trading, with the NYSE Arca Disk Drive Index jumping by 5.6 percent. The index ended the previous session at a four-month closing low. Datalink (DTLK) is leading the storage sector higher after the company agreed to be acquired by Insight Enterprises (NSIT) in a deal valued at approximately $258 million. Significant strength is also visible among biotechnology stocks, as reflected by the 3.9 percent gain being posted by the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index. With the gain, the index is climbing further off the four-month closing low it set last Thursday. Amgen (AMGN) is posting a notable gain after the FDA approved the company's supplemental Biologics License Application for the expanded use of Enbrel. Steel, airline, semiconductor, and banking stocks are also seeing considerable strength, moving higher along with most of the other major sectors. Gold stocks are among the few sectors bucking the uptrend, dragging the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index down by 4.8 percent. The weakness in the sector comes amid a steep drop by the price of gold. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region moved higher during trading on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index surged up by 1.6 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index advanced by 0.7 percent. The major European markets are also seeing significant strength on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index jumped by 1.7 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index both shot up by 1.9 percent. In the bond market, treasuries have moved to the downside amid the rally on Wall Street. Subsequently, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by 4.5 basis points at 1.828 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America More Commentary -Global Renewed Support Tipped For China Bourse Taiwan Stock Market May Snap Losing Streak Singapore Bourse Likely To Crack Resistance At 2,800 Points Malaysia Market May Extend Tuesday's Gains South Korea Shares May Find Traction On Wednesday Stocks Close Mostly Higher Following Upbeat Retail Sales Data - U.S. Commentary Major Averages Remain Mixed In Mid-Day Trading - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Mostly Higher, But Little Changed Overall Nasdaq And S&P 500 Move Higher But Dow Gives Back Ground - U.S. Commentary Stocks May Open Higher On Upbeat Retail Sales Data - U.S. Commentary Wall Street Aims At Higher Opening Sensex Plunges 514 Points On Capital Outflow Worries; Nifty Nears 8,200 European Shares Cling To Gains After Data Deluge FTSE 100 Breaches 6800 As Pound Extends Slide CAC 40 Extends Gains As Oil Rallies <<Previous        51 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates Vodafone Slips To Pre-Tax Loss On Hefty India Charge; Narrows FY View Merck KgaA Lifts FY16 Earnings View As Q3 Results Climb, Stock Up Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Amaya Gets Huge Buyout Bid From Former CEO Zuckerberg: Facebook Hoax News Did Not Get Trump Elected Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Siemens To Buy Mentor Graphics For $4.5 Bln Enterprise Value Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy ADAP Surges As FDA Lifts Clinical Hold, OCUL Catches Eyes, RegeneRx On The Rise AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD Pfizer : IBRANCE Approved In Europe To Treat HR+/HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer Engie 9-month EBITDA Declines - Quick Facts FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Google Rejects EU Antitrust Charges Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Walmart Introduces Black Friday 2016 Deals; Walmart App's Deals Start Today Vivendi Turns To Profit In Q3, Revenues Up; Maintains View K+S Group Posts Q3 Negative EBIT I; Cuts 2016 EBIT I View Frankfurt Airport Oct.

By JosephAdinolfi Markets reporter U.S. corporate debt is poised to outperform U.S. equities should Tuesday’s presidential election trigger a dramatic risk-on rally, according to a team of strategists at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. In support of this view, the team, led by strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, pointed to the relative positioning among the largest funds in each category. Withdrawals from equity funds have outpaced outflows from their high-yield debt peers over the past few weeks. Investors withdrew close to $3 billion from high-yields funds in the week ended Wednesday, but a similar amount flowed out of equity funds in the past three days alone, according to data provided by J.P. Morgan. But when it comes to forecasting how each market might react to the election, the flows aren’t as important as the overall short positioning. So-called shorts are bets that an asset’s value will fall in value. When investors short a given asset, they essentially borrow that asset with a promise of repaying it at a later date. If the value of the asset falls, the investor can pocket the difference between the price he originally borrowed it. However, if the price rises, the trader will be forced to cover the difference, resulting in a loss. Like a rubber band, the stretched short-positioning in high-yield debt suggests that gains would accelerate quickly if Clinton wins, driven in part by traders scrambling to close out their positions by buying back the bonds they borrowed at a loss — a phenomenon known as a short squeeze. Read: Follow the leader: Junk bond gains may herald a coming equity rally “In all, ahead of the U.S. election, there is less negativity embedded in U.S. equity [exchange-traded funds] relative to last June, ahead of the Brexit referendum, and a lot less negativity relative to the capitulation levels of last January,” said Panigirtzoglou and company in a recent research note. “The negativity embedded in U.S. HY ETFs looks rather extreme by comparison.” In the two charts below, J.P. Morgan compares the short interest ratio of the largest U.S. equity ETF, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, +0.78% —which is widely known by its ticker, SPY—with two of the biggest high-yield ETFs, the iBoxx USD High Yield Corporate Bond ETF HYG, +1.32%  and the SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond ETF JNK, +1.33% Datalend, J.P. Morgan Here’s an illustration of the short interest in the largest U.S. equity fund, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust. Datalend, J.P. Morgan Positioning in the two largest high-yield bond funds is looking relatively stretched. All three funds were in the green on Monday, after Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey informed Congress that the bureau won’t pursue charges against Clinton related to her handling of emails while secretary of state. SPY was up 1.5%, while HYG and JNK were both up 1%. Risky assets like equities and high-yield debt could rally if Democratic nominee prevails over her Republican rival, Donald Trump, which is, in J.P. Morgan’s estimation, the more likely outcome. Read: This Election Day outcome is stock market’s worst-case scenario Of course, if you’re betting on a Trump victory, short them both. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index were rallying sharply after the odds of a Trump victory appeared to dim following the FBI’s decision not to charge Clinton in a probe into her alleged misuse of a private email server.

Reuters reports that this group, which includes top bankers like JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and powerful investors like Carl Icahn and Berkshire Hathaway Inc's Warren Buffett, were eschewing electronic communications long before the probe of U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's emails and the recent hacks of her campaign manager's account made headlines. Some on Wall Street are nostalgic for a time when in-person conversations or phone calls were the norm, but others believe the words they type and send can come back to haunt them. Prosecutors have built insider trading, mortgage fraud and rate-rigging cases on embarrassing emails over the past several years, and they are often the most memorable part. Recent email woes among Washington power players have provided yet another reason for bankers to try to protect private correspondence from prying eyes. Dimon uses email but is known to keep his replies short and factual, favoring "yes," "no" and "thank you."
