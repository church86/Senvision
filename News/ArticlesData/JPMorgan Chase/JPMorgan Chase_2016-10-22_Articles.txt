But there’s a dose of concern that the $40 billion loan pledge may get caught up in a regulatory impasse. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has pledged $25 billion of the financing, with Bank of America Corp. providing the rest, according to a regulatory filing. That’s believed to be the most JPMorgan has ever promised for a deal, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified without authorization to speak publicly. The lending commitment alone would bring about $110 million to $130 million in fees for JPMorgan and Bank of America, according to estimates from consulting firm Freeman & Co. It also gives the banks an advantage on bond offerings that would find eager buyers among yield-starved investors. At the same time, the banks face the risk that the deal, along with a chunk of their balance sheets, would be tied up if regulators delay approving it. “This could be an especially lucrative deal for the banking industry; they’re going to make a lot of money if the deal gets done” said Bert Ely, a banking consultant at Ely & Co. “The numbers on the credit piece look big, but I’m sure the credit risk will be spread widely. The big uncertainty hanging over this will be the battle for regulatory approval and what lender protections are included if the deal fails.” T-Mobile Failure A failed megadeal wouldn’t be the first for AT&T. In 2011, the company abandoned its takeover of T-Mobile USA because of regulatory hurdles. JPMorgan had lined up $20 billion to finance that deal. Taking on commitments to underwrite large deals helps JPMorgan maintain its top position in leading corporate debt deals in the U.S. JPMorgan has occupied the top spot for managing dollar bond sales from highly rated companies since 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank has been the top provider of similarly rated loans for each year since 2005, Bloomberg data show. To help finance this proposed deal, AT&T brought in Bank of America as its partner on Thursday, keeping the number of participants to a minimum until the announcement, the person said. JPMorgan intends in the coming weeks to syndicate most of the $40 billion loan to other banks that already lend to AT&T. Bridge Loan The loan is structured as a bridge deal, a type of financing that a borrower repays by issuing debt in capital markets. In the case of AT&T, most of the deal will be replaced by high-grade bonds, with a potential portion in the form of term loans, the person said. The interest on the loan will be tied to the company’s debt ratings, according to the filing. The margin will start at 100 basis points above the London interbank offered rate, plus a commitment fee. That’s based on the fact the company’s unsecured long-term debt has an A- rating from Fitch Ratings Ltd., the highest among the three biggest rating companies. There are additional duration fees scheduled. The facility also includes a covenant that AT&T must keep net debt under 3.5 times its consolidated Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to the filing. AT&T Chief Financial Officer John Stephens said on a conference call today that the company is targeting 2.5 times leverage at the end of year one and seeking 1.8 times by the end of year four. The company doesn’t expect a credit-rating downgrade and is committed to its investment-grade metrics, Stephens said. But the lenders themselves are taking on other risks by using their balance sheet resources, according to Charles Peabody, a bank analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading.  “That is dangerous because this deal could be hung up in antitrust wranglings for a long time,’’ he said. JPMorgan and Bank of America won’t be protected if credit markets swing and they can’t sell the debt for what they had anticipated, he said.  Jessica Francisco, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, and Thomas Rottcher, a Bank of America spokesman, declined to comment. AT&T, based in Dallas, didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail and calls on Sunday. The deal caps AT&T Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson’s vision to expand the company into media and entertainment as its wireless business matures. Gaining premium cable channels HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros. studio means AT&T becomes a content owner rather than just a distributor of video. Yield Hunger For the investors that would later be asked to buy bonds refinancing the bridge loan, the takeover means a juicy alternative to the more than $10 trillion of debt globally that’s yielding less than zero, driven down by easy-money policies from Europe to Japan. “The investor base is starved for yield,” said David Hendler, founder of Viola Risk Advisors and a veteran bank analyst. “This would be a good earning asset in a low yield world -- which is very much in demand at the moment in the syndicate market. Banks are deposit-rich and looking to invest in loans.” The prospective deal has raised regulatory questions ahead of the U.S. election, as both the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees expressed suspicion of blockbuster deals. Hillary Clinton has been critical of big mergers and has called for “reinvigorating” antitrust enforcement while her opponent Donald Trump broke with Republican orthodoxy on Saturday by saying he would block the Time Warner acquisition, arguing that such deals leave too much power concentrated among too few companies. If AT&T’s deal doesn’t gain approval, it must pay a $500 million reverse break-up fee to Time Warner, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Bond Trading Beyond collecting the fees that come from underwriting large takeovers, banks also benefit from trading that debt in the secondary market. CEO Brian Moynihan pointed to Bank of America’s debt underwriting business as a reason for his beat last week in estimates for third-quarter fixed-income trading revenue.  Wall Street’s biggest investment banks have been taking a greater percentage of their overall revenue from issuing new debt and trading fixed-income products, which includes corporate debt, sovereign debt, currencies and commodities. Debt underwriting made up 11.3 percent of U.S. investment banks’ third-quarter revenue, about a percentage point more than in the same period two years ago, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. U.S. banks relied on fixed-income underwriting and trading to propel 56 percent of their total investment banking business in the third quarter, a rise from 47 percent last year and 50 percent two years ago, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. “These guys are fairly anxious to generate fee income. This is an area where you can make money very quickly. And very big money,’’ said Compass Point’s Peabody.  Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

 America's biggest banks are closing hundreds of branches Tina Wadhwa Oct. 23, 2016, 8:43 AM 37,231 facebook linkedin twitter email print Bank branches in the old days. Dreamworks/"Catch Me If You Can"/YouTube America's biggest banks are closing hundreds of branches. Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan shut 389 branches since the third quarter of last year.  Bank of America, which had over 6,000 branches before the financial crisis has now shrank to 4,629, according to third quarter accounts.  The bank has cut 112 financial centers from last year.  Paul Donofrio, CFO of Bank of America, said the closing of branches was part of a "shift to self-served digital channels, mobile, online, and ATM" in a 3Q earnings call transcript.  According to the 3Q earnings report, the bank has 21 million mobile banking active users and 18% of deposit transactions are completed through mobile devices. "That’s better for customers, it’s also better for our shareholders," said Donofrio. "It’s one-tenth the cost of walking into a branch." "So it’s a quality versus quantity and making sure we understand," said CEO Brian Monihyan on the earnings call. "I’d say we went from seven million visits probably four to five years ago to six to five. But those five are of a higher quality, and we think that’s important." There are less bank branches, but the ones that stand reflect changing customers' behaviors. As consumers opt to go online for transactional services like check deposits, bank branches now emphasize  more value added services that " you just have to do face to face" and are adding more mortgage and investment specialists.  They are becoming a place to come for advice according to life events - mortgages, investments, saving for college. REUTERS/ Brendan McDermid And the cuts aren't just in terms of bank branches but also in headcount. Bank of America indicated back in June that it planned to cut over 8,000 jobs from its consumer banking division. According to retail banking head and consumer banking co-head Thong Nguyen at a June conference, this is part of a broader cost-cutting and resource reallocation program to meet with consumers' changing banking habits. Bank of America isn't the only bank to restructure its branches. When Citigroup announced its third-quarter earnings last Friday, October 14, it revealed its branch count has shrunk 7% in North America from the third quarter of last year and is down 116 banks globally to 2,679. "We have spent the last several years reshaping our branch network, upgrading technology and deepening our focus on our core six markets, enabling us to grow revenues while reducing expenses and significantly improving the profitability of our retail bank," Citigroup CFO John Gerspach said on the 3Q earnings call. Earlier this year, Citi Global Perspectives and Solutions (GPS) produced a report that found that banks are quickly approaching their "automation tipping point," and they could soon reduce headcount by as much as 30%. "Banks' Uber moment will mean a disintermediation of bank branches rather than the banks themselves," the report said. "Specifically, it will mean the shift to mobile distribution being the main channel of interaction between customers and the bank," the report reads. A man walks past a Citibank ATM in Los Angeles Thomson Reuters That means that there will be less need for bank branches, and the people who work inside them. JPMorgan has also been cutting back on the number of retail branches, with 161 less branches this quarter than the third quarter of last year. 3Q 2016 stores stand at 5,310, down from 5,471 in the same quarter last year.  According to JPMorganCFO Marianne Lake on the 3Q earnings call, new card account originations were up 35% this quarter, with more than three quarters of new accounts being opened through digital channels, and active mobile users were up 17% in 3Q.  JPMorgan is also focusing marketing efforts to millennial customers, who now compromise 57% of new checking account customers and are more likely to use mobile banking.  Major retail bank Wells Fargo historically hasn't cut branches as much as its peers and hasn't announced any major closures in light of its huge fraudulant account scandal. However, credit card applications, consumer loyalty and interactions between branch bankers and customers have declined sharply according to its 3Q earnings report last Friday, October 14. In the 3Q quarterly earnings report, the bank indicated a renewed shift to mobile, which they said "will allow us to review our branch footprint for consolidation opportunities."

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images "Whether Wells Fargo realizes it or not, they're going to be closing 1,000 branches," CLSA bank analyst Mike Mayo told CNN Money. "It's a matter of when, not if." While traditional retail banks shift their focus to digital models, others not in the consumer space, like Goldman Sachs, are launching online only US savings account. Online only GS Bank launched this past April and Goldman's new consumer lending arm, Marcus, launched earlier this month.  "Digital technology is making large brick and mortar branches questionable," said Harit Talwar, head of Digital Finance at Goldman Sachs, in a podcast. "You don't need necessarily brick and mortar branch networks to get into consumer financial services. Why wait in line when I can do it in on the phone? The traditional distribution strengths that some of the large banks have, from distribution strengths have become legacy costs."

Rockwell Collins is acquiring B/E Aerospace for $6.4 billion in a combination of big suppliers to plane makers Boeing and Airbus that can be seen as consolidation forced by slowing growth. U.S. life insurer Genworth Financial said it agreed to be acquired by China Oceanwide Holdings of Beijing for $2.7 billion. And in Australia, a group of outback scions made it a bidding war for the iconic S. Kidman & Co., the beef producer descended from the rancher who once was the world’s largest single landholder. The commitments by JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America for $40 billion in financing for the AT&T-Time Warner deal could be highly profitable but are fraught with risk if the deal won’t pass muster with U.S. regulators. Iraq is indicating it won’t go along with oil production cuts, possibly leaving OPEC nowhere once again as its members grapple with low oil prices. It didn’t help that Russia isn’t committing to supporting a cut, either. The head of Britain’s banking trade group predicted an exodus of banks by the end of the year, well before the U.K. takes its first formal steps to leave the European Union. Spain appears on the way to having functional leadership for the first time in almost a year, after the Socialists elected to step aside and let the acting prime minister form a minority coalition and take office for another term. Evan McMullin, the U.S. independent presidential candidate who’s come out of nowhere to lead some polls in his native Utah, said in his first Sunday-show appearance that he can’t see the Republican Party surviving after the election as it now exists. Venezuela’s increasingly powerless Congress staged a symbolic coup of sorts with President Nicolas Maduro away talking to Middle East oil producers. It passed legislation asking the military not to follow Maduro’s orders and trying to overturn unilateral Supreme Court appointments. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

For everyone else, it's awkward at best.   Rebecca Greenfield Bloomberg     The future of job interviews might horrify you. It horrified Jake Rosen. A recent graduate of UCLA, Rosen was applying to be a page at NBC (yes, yes, just like Kenneth) when he learned he wouldn't be going to an office to talk to a human being about his skills. Instead, he interviewed by webcam, on a laptop. So Skype, right? Nope, nothing as personal as that. He recorded his answers and sent them back to a hiring manager at NBC for review at the company's convenience. It's the robo-interview, and it goes something like this. In the more humane experience, a hiring manager, who also isn't all that practiced in the art of digital video, delivers taped questions. Or, if it's truly Mr. Roboto, a question pops up on the screen. You have a limited amount of time to answer. You talk to your computer, record the responses, and send them back to the company. Sometimes there's a practice question to get prospective employees used to talking to a camera. Sometimes there isn't. Often, at the end, you have the chance to rerecord your answers. For shy people, it may be a dream come true. No firm handshake needed, and sure, you smell fine. And wouldn't we all love the redo option after making up an answer and mumbling it, too? For everyone else, it's awkward at best. It's a pretty slick encounter, a little like FaceTime, except you're forced to stare at your big, nervous face as you wax on about why you want to work at the company. It feels more like performing for an invisible audience than having a conversation, because that's essentially what it is. Not used to being on camera, Rosen felt flustered from the first question, which colored the rest of his interview, he said. "I'm not a YouTube star, obviously," he said. "It's such a weird experience talking to a camera. It honestly was pretty horrible." Jamie Black, who suffered through the video interview experience for a job at a school, said it felt "more like a game show than an interview." For many of us, the experience will soon be unavoidable. The human-free video job interview is on the rise. HireVue, one of a handful of companies making video interview software, works with 600 large organizations, including Deloitte, JPMorgan Chase, Under Armour, and most of the major U.S. airlines. This year, the company will do 2.5 million interviews, up from 13,000 five years ago. Nearly 90 percent of those are "on demand" interviews, with nobody live at the other end. For a hiring manager, the draw of the video interview is mainly efficiency. "Companies want to get to know way more people," said Mark Newman, the founder of HireVue. A recruiter can only get through so many 30-minute conversations in a day. And that doesn't take into account time lost to scheduling or on bad candidates. With a video interview, human resources staff members only have to review the answers, and can do so on their own schedule, without having to travel for on-campus recruiting. Using HireVue, Hilton got its hiring cycle down to 4.5 days, almost 20 days shorter than the average interview process. All of this saves companies money. Cigna has cut travel expenses for recruiters from $1 million a year, in some cases, to under $100,000. For the job candidate, the benefit of robo-recruiting is convenience-and that's about it. Generally, a company will give an interviewee a day or two to complete the interview, which can happen anywhere. That might sound like another plus, but for Rosen it only added to his stress. "You start to think about things you wouldn't normally think about in interviews. I started thinking about my surroundings," Rosen said. "I had to find a blank wall to sit in front of. ... Should I put a bookshelf behind me? A plant?" Recruiters say they don't judge candidates on their performance, appearance, or locale. "Judging is an interesting word," said Heidi Soltis-Berner, the managing director for talent at Deloitte. "I would say the on-demand interview is truly for fact sharing." Other recruiters said they do evaluate people on their communication abilities and eye contact. Even if hiring managers are instructed not to make decisions on how well a potential new employee can perform in front of a camera (which is a bit hard to believe), the whole setup can be trying. "You just see yourself and a stopwatch ticking down," said Black, who said his answers often got cut off by the timer. If and when he has to do it again, Black said, he would practice in front of a mirror with a stopwatch before the interview. Rosen said it might help to have someone sit behind the computer, as the interview happens, so it's like talking to a person instead of a screen. Just look at the camera so your focus isn't off. The best advice might be to just relax. "It's OK to come across as uncomfortable in front of the camera, because everyone is," said Scott Mitchell, a recruiter for American Wedding Group, which uses video interviews to prescreen the 1,900 independent contractors it works with. "We all assume you're going to be uncomfortable. We're putting you in an uncomfortable position." The robo-interview hasn't replaced human interaction completely. Many companies use it as a replacement for first-round screening interviews, followed by more traditional one-on-ones. But for interviewees who would rather go back to the old way ... that's not happening. Organizations can look at more people, and a more diverse set of people, with the video interviews, and save money on top of that. "Candidates will generally say, 'I would have preferred an in-person interview to this,' but that's not the right comparison," HireVue's Newman said. "The alternative is no interview at all."

PRIMO PIANO ECONOMIA SPETTACOLI e CULTURA CINEMA SOCIETÀ SPORT ROMA TECNOLOGIA MOTORI SALUTE VIAGGI WEB TV HOME ECONOMIA E FINANZA FLASH NEWS ECONOMIA 2016 BORSA ITALIANA BORSE ESTERE ETF VALUTE FONDI COMUNI AT&T compra Time Warner: accordo per 85,4 mld dollari (Teleborsa) - Nasce negli Usa un nuovo colosso delle telecomunicazioni. Il già gigante At&T acquista la major americana Time Warner, proprietaria degli studios di Hollywood, della Cnn e della Hbo. Il mega accordo nel campo dell'entertainment vale 84,5 miliardi di dollari (108,7 miliardi incluso il debito), pari a una valutazione di 107,50 dollari per azioni , 53,75 cash e altrettanti in azioni AT&T, da pagare parte in denaro e parte in titoli. L'annuncio è stato dato da At&T, dopo la conclusione dei Cda dei due Gruppi, che ha rivelato i dettagli dell'intesa tra i due colossi. Per l'acquisizione, AT&T si sarebbe assicurata una linea di credito da 40 milioni di dollari, di cui 25 da parte di JPMorgan e 15 da Bank of America. L'attuale situazione finanziaria di AT&T, al momento, sarebbe di circa 7 milioni di dollari di liquidità e di un debito che raggiungerebbe i 120 milioni. AT&T dovrebbe comunque pagare una commissione di 500 milioni di dollari se l'operazione di acquisizione dovesse essere bloccata. Oltre al rischio rappresentato dalla valutazione dell'antitrust, l'eventuale elezione di Donald Trump alla Casa Bianca manderebbe tutto a monte. Il candidato repubblicano alla presidenza degli Stati Uniti ha, infatti, già reso noto la volontà di non approvare l'acquisizione in quanto "accordi di questo genere minacciano la democrazia". L'accordo "è la perfetta unione tra due compagnie con punti di forza complementari che possono portare un approccio fresco al lavoro nell'industria dei media e della comunicazioni per i clienti, per i creatori di contenuti, per i distributori e per gli inserzionisti", ha dichiarato il Ceo e Presidente del gigante delle Tlc americane Randall Stephenson. Adesso tutto dovrà necessariamente passare al vaglio delle autorità antitrust. Dopo l'acquisto, infatti, AT&T diventa un rivale potente di Comcast, che detiene la rivale di Time Warner, la NBCUniversal, e si pone come minaccia anche per i servizi di enterteinment online come Netflix e Amazon. Inoltre avvicina AT&T al competitor storico Verizon, che ha acquisito il gruppo internet Aol ed è in trattative per comprare Yahoo. At&T spera di concludere tutte le verifiche e l'acquisizione entro la fine del 2017. 2016-10-23 11:45:02 © RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA CONDIVIDI NOTIZIA PER POTER INVIARE UN COMMENTO DEVI ESSERE REGISTRATO Se sei già registrato inserisci username e password oppure registrati ora.

REUTERS Actualizada 23/10/2016 a las 11:26 EFE. NUEVA YORK Time Warner, que lleva siete años desprendiéndose de distintas compañías del conglomerado, quedará finalmente en manos del grupo de telecomunicaciones AT&T, que aceptó este domingo pagar 79.000 millones de euros por la firma, sin incluir deuda asumida. El acuerdo fue anunciado por AT&T y Time Warner en un comunicado conjunto, que pone fin a una serie de informaciones que venían filtrándose desde el viernes y que habían puesto en alerta a los mercados bursátiles. Se trata de la fusión mayor que se anuncia este año, y los expertos no descartan que pueda abrir el paso a otras operaciones, aunque será difícil que se llegue a corto plazo a los montos anunciados este domingo. De acuerdo con el comunicado conjunto, AT&T, el mayor grupo del sector en Estados Unidos, pagará 107,50 dólares por cada título de Time Warner, lo que valora la compañía en 85.400 millones de dólares. Pero el monto es mayor si se considera la deuda de Time Warner que asume el comprador, lo que elevaría la cuantía a 108.700 millones de dólares (100.600 millones de euros), aunque puede haber una renegociación en algunos de los términos de esos compromisos de deuda. Cada accionista de Time Warner recibirá en efectivo la mitad del valor de cada título que posea y el resto en acciones de AT&T. Este grupo de telecomunicaciones, con tres décadas de existencia, tiene una capitalización bursátil de unos 233.000 millones de dólares, un poco menos que el principal grupo bancario de Estados Unidos, JP Morgan Chase. Se trata del paso más importante que acomete en los últimos años AT&T y que sigue a su decisión, en 2014, de comprar el proveedor de televisión por satélite DirecTV por 49.000 millones de dólares, lo que le convirtió en líder mundial en televisión de pago. Para Time Warner, en cambio, representa en final de una serie de operaciones que han ido mermando el poder de ese grupo desde 2009, en un proceso llevado a cabo en medio de una fuerte crisis en el sector. Fue en 2009 cuando Time Warner se desprendió de la distribuidora de cable Time Warner Cable y ese mismo año anunció su separación de la firma AOL, que llegó a marcar una época en los orígenes de internet en Estados Unidos. Y en 2014 anunció que se desprendía también de la firma Time Inc., editora de la revista del mismo nombre. Pero ahora aporta a la fusión, entre otras marcas, las cadenas de televisión CNN y TNT, los canales HBO y TBS y los estudios Warner Bros, además de derechos televisivos en importantes acontecimientos deportivos. El precio de 107,50 dólares por cada acción de Time Warner está por encima de los 80 dólares en los que estaban los títulos de esa compañía antes de que comenzaran a filtrarse las informaciones sobre las negociaciones entre los empresarios de los dos grupos. Al cierre del viernes en Wall Street, los títulos de Time Warner terminaron con un avance del 7,82 %, mientras que los de AT&T perdieron un 3 %, en el lógico retroceso del valor de los títulos de la firma compradora en operaciones como la anunciada hoy. "Tenemos la intención de dar a los clientes una selección inigualable, calidad, valor y experiencias que definan el futuro de los medios las telecomunicaciones", afirmó el presidente de AT&T, Randall Stpehenson. Por su parte, el máximo directivo de Time Warner, Jeff Bewkes, coincidió en que la operación es "un paso natural entre dos empresas con grandes legados de innovación". En su comunicado, AT&T anuncia que el acuerdo está pendiente de ser aprobado por los accionistas de la compañía y de la revisión por parte de las autoridades reguladoras. De momento, sin embargo, han comenzado a surgir reservas sobre el acuerdo. En un mitin en el que participó hoy, el candidato presidencial republicano, Donald Trump, aseguró que, de llegar a la Casa Blanca tras las elecciones del 8 de noviembre, intentará bloquear el acuerdo. "Acuerdos como éste destruyen la democracia", afirmó el magnate neoyorquino. Comentarios Lo más...

Un matrimonio da 85,4 miliardi di dollari. I consigli di amministrazione delle due società hanno dato il via libera all'operazione ''E' l'unione perfetta che può tradursi in un nuovo approccio su come l'industria dei media e delle telecomunicazioni funziona'', afferma Randall Stephenson, l'amministratore delegato di At&t, che, secondo indiscrezioni assumerà la guida del colosso che nasce con l'acquisizione di Time Warner. At&t pagherà 107,5 dollari per azione, la metà in contanti e la metà in titoli, e per finanziare l'operazione ha ottenuto un prestito ponte da 40 miliardi di dollari da JPMorgan e Bank of America. Una volta che l'operazione sarà chiusa gli azionisti di Time Warner avranno il 14,4-15,7% di At&t. ''E' un gran giorno per i nostri azionisti'', mette in evidenza il numero uno di Time Warner, Jeff Bewkes. La cifra ottenuta è superiore alle attese di Time Warner che, incluso il debito, chiedeva 100 miliardi di dollari. E superiore a quanto messo due anni fa sul piatto da Rupert Murdoch, che aveva proposto 85 dollari per azione. L'accordo, secondo indiscrezioni, prevede una clausola con cui Time Warner si impegna a pagare 1,7 miliardi di dollari nel caso in cui ricevesse e accettasse un'offerta rivale. At&t pagherà invece una commissione se l'accordo dovesse essere bloccato. L'intesa deve infatti essere approvata dal Dipartimento di Giustizia, con le due società che si augurano di ricevere le necessarie autorizzazioni entro la fine del 2017. La strada non sarà facile, soprattutto in un anno elettorale. Donald Trump, il candidato repubblicano, ha detto che una sua amministrazione non approverebbe un tale accordo, così come non doveva essere approvato quello fra Comcast e NBCUniversal. ''Accordi di questo genere minacciano la democrazia'', ha messo in evidenza Trump.

Photo: Reuters Boston/New York: AT&T Inc. agreed to buy Time Warner Inc. for $85.4 billion, forming a telecommunications and media empire that will own many of the movies and TV shows it pumps through to subscribers of its wireless, Internet and pay-TV services. The cash-and-stock deal values Time Warner at about $107.50 a share, the companies said Saturday in a statement, 20% more than Friday’s closing price. Time Warner shareholders are to receive $53.75 per share in cash and $53.75 a share in AT&T stock. “This is a perfect match of two companies with complementary strengths who can bring a fresh approach to how the media and communications industry works,” AT&T chairman and chief executive officer Randall Stephenson said in the statement. The deal caps Stephenson’s vision to expand AT&T into media and entertainment as its wireless business matures. Gaining premium cable channel HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros. studio means AT&T becomes a content owner rather than just a distributor of video. “When we first discussed this we thought it might be unique enough and worthy of investigating whether we could put the two companies together and create something different,” Stephenson said on a conference call Saturday night to discuss the deal. The negotiation process went fast, he said, adding that it had “a gravity to it.” Executive meetings Senior executives of the companies had met in recent weeks to discuss business strategies and an agreement was near as of Friday, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the talks. The acquisition comes a little more than a year after Dallas-based AT&T became the largest US pay-TV distributor when it completed its $48.5 billion purchase of satellite-TV provider DirecTV. The transaction is valued at $108.7 billion including Time Warner’s net debt. Once the deal closes, Time Warner shareholders will own between 14.4% and 15.7% of AT&T shares. AT&T expects the deal to be accretive in the first year and sees $1 billion in annual cost synergies within three years of closing. AT&T has commitments for a bridge loan of $40 billion to finance part of the cash portion of the deal, according to the statement. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is contributing $25 billion of the financing, with Bank of America Corp. providing the rest, according to a person familiar with the arrangement. The proposed deal calls for Time Warner to pay about a $1.72 billion breakup fee, and AT&T to pay $500 million, a separate person said. “This is going to supercharge our creative abilities, allow us to experiment more and it gives us more financial heft,” Time Warner chairman and CEO Jeff Bewkes said on the call. “I think it will attract more cutting-edge projects and talent, so we are going full steam ahead.” ‘Awkward marriage’ “It was time to do a deal and Time Warner was available,” Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research in New York, said in an interview before the transaction was announced. He has a neutral rating on AT&T’s shares. “Time Warner offers a premier set of media assets; the only one that is bigger is Disney.” “A transaction of this magnitude obviously warrants very close regulatory scrutiny,” a spokeswoman for Walt Disney Co. said. Chaplin called the combination “an awkward marriage.” AT&T, rooted in a century-old telecommunications system, is attempting to pair a more stodgy culture with one that has a distinctly more dynamic New York media and Hollywood mindset. One of the largest corporate employers in the country with some 281,000 workers at the end of last year, AT&T posted 2015 revenue of $146.8 billion. Time Warner, with almost 25,000 employees, reported revenue of $28.1 billion. Time Warner’s huge entertainment offering gives AT&T new revenue streams at a time when subscribers to traditional pay-TV are cutting the cord and switching to cheaper “skinny bundles” like Dish Network Corp.’s Sling TV or to online services such as Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. To keep its wireless customers from switching to lower-priced rivals T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp., AT&T has offered packages of unlimited mobile data and TV service. Time Warner will represent about 15% of the combined company’s revenues. The deal comes two years after Time Warner’s Bewkes and his board rejected an $85-a-share offer from Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox Inc., which valued Time Warner at the time at more than $75 billion. Original programming In the interim, Bewkes has focused on creating must-see original programming and acquiring sports rights to draw TV viewers and extract higher fees from AT&T and other distributors such as Comcast Corp. Time Warner also owns a 10% stake in web-streaming service Hulu LLC, which it paid $583 million for earlier this year, according to people with knowledge of that deal. Bewkes, 64, will stay at the combined company for a transition period after the deal, he said on a conference call Saturday. No specific time has been set for how long he’ll stay. On the call to discuss the deal, Bewkes acknowledged Time Warner’s checkered dealmaking history, including its disastrous merger with America Online Inc. in 2000. “Time Warner has been through many combinations, many historic,” Bewkes said. “The first one Time and Warner, and then we added Turner, and then we did have a misstep of course with AOL. We are feeling very positive about this.” In the second quarter, Time Warner’s Turner cable network had revenue of $3 billion, while HBO posted sales of $1.5 billion, and the Warner Bros. studio, producer of the “Harry Potter” franchise, “The Big Bang Theory” and DC Comics properties, had sales of $2.7 billion. The merger is subject to approval by Time Warner shareholders as well as review by the US justice department, and is expected to close by year-end 2017. Time Warner also has an airwaves license for a TV station in Atlanta, which could give the FCC jurisdiction to scrutinize the deal if that license is transferred to AT&T. They potentially could sell the station to escape FCC scrutiny. ‘Blank page’ The FCC’s newer rules have restricted growth for carriers in the telecom world. That’s driven them to integrate other businesses like television and media, Roger Entner, an analyst with Recon Analytics LLC in Dedham, Massachusetts, said in an interview before the deal was announced. “The wildcard in all this will be the FCC,” Entner said. “It’s hard to predict what the regulators will do. They are pretty much starting with a blank page.” Entner chimed in on how the US presidential election results might affect the deal. He said if Hillary Clinton wins, the regulatory stance will be similar to what we have today. Trump, before the agreement was announced, said Saturday that he would look to block the deal if elected. He said such media combinations leave too much power concentrated among too few companies, including ones he says are hostile to his presidential bid and rigging the election for Clinton. The policy director of Free Press, a Florence, Massachusetts-based telecommunications advocacy group, said the proposed deal “would cost internet users and TV viewers dearly.” “Any time you hear media executives talking about synergies, throwing around the business-babble that always accompanies these rumors, you know it’s time grab your wallet and hang on tight,” Matt Wood said in an e-mail before the deal was announced.

Quotes in the article AT&T Inc T ▲ 36.77 +0.64 +1.77% Time Warner Inc TWX ▲ 88.67 +1.87 +2.15% Twenty-First Century Fox Inc FOX ▲ 27.40 +0.07 +0.26% Comcast Corp CMCSA ▼ 66.98 -0.28 -0.42% The wireless carrier agreed to pay $107.50 a share, it said in a press release Saturday night. The deal is half cash and half stock. AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson will head the new company and Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes will leave after an interim period following the deal, a person familiar with matter said. The acquisition will put telecom veteran Mr. Stephenson, 56 years old, atop a business that combines the carrier’s millions of wireless and pay-television subscribers with Time Warner’s deep media lineup including networks such as CNN, TNT, the prized HBO channel and Warner Bros. film and TV studio. For Time Warner, the deal represents a victory for Mr. Bewkes, 64, who took some heat from investors for rebuffing a takeover bid two years ago from 21st Century Fox at $85 a share. (21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal-owner News Corp share common ownership.) Time Warner has agreed to pay a $1.7 billion breakup fee if another company outbids AT&T’s offer, a different person familiar with the plans said. AT&T meanwhile would pay $500 million if the deal gets blocked, this person said. AT&T will tap $40 billion in bridge loans, a person said, with $25 billion coming from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and $25 billion from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For AT&T, the deal will help the carrier potentially find new areas of growth as its core wireless business has become saturated and its market share leaves little room for acquisitions. For Time Warner, the tie-up comes amid pressure for media companies to bulk up or join with larger entities in the face of consolidation among pay-TV distributors and viewers increasingly leaving their expensive cable packages for cheaper online streaming options. A merger of the companies would be the most ambitious marriage of content and distribution in the media and telecom industries since Comcast Corp.’s purchase of NBCUniversal and would create a behemoth to rival that cable giant. A rigorous regulatory review is expected and the acquisition of Time Warner likely wouldn’t close until late 2017, people close to the process said. Regulators have indicated misgivings about the prior Comcast-NBCU deal—in particular, whether obligations placed on Comcast were tough enough and enforceable—so it is unclear if they will be willing to bless another such merger. At the very least, former regulatory officials say there could be significant conditions placed on the combination. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said his administration wouldn’t approve a proposed merger of AT&T and Time Warner because he opposes further consolidation in the media industry. The transaction would be far and away the biggest media deal of recent years, potentially breathing new life into media deal-making. Time Warner had a market capitalization of $68 billion before the Journal reported on the advanced talks Friday, while AT&T’s was $233 billion. © Richard B. Levine/Newscom/Zuma Press On Friday, Time Warner shares closed at $89.48, up 8%, while AT&T fell 3%, to $37.49. AT&T has been shifting its sights to media and video in recent years, diving deeper into television after its nearly $50 billion deal to acquire satellite television provider DirecTV last year. That made AT&T, which traces its roots to the old ‘Ma Bell, the country’s biggest pay television provider as well as its second-largest wireless operator. Time Warner “is the last scaled content play that’s acquirable,” said Michael Nathanson, an analyst at MoffettNathanson, noting that the rest of the major media companies are either so valuable they would be difficult to acquire, such as Walt Disney Co., or family controlled, such as 21st Century Fox, CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. “HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. are really good assets for a future of nonlinear consumption.” The sale represents a strategic departure for Mr. Bewkes, who spent his nearly nine years as CEO slimming down the onetime media behemoth, unwinding the AOL merger and spinning out Time Warner Cable and Time Inc. The three businesses that remained—HBO, Turner Broadcasting and Warner Bros.—are focused solely on video content. In lieu of acquisitions, Mr. Bewkes focused on containing costs and buying back stock. A cerebral Stanford M.B.A. known for his financial acumen, Mr. Bewkes’s strategy was influenced in part by scars from the disastrous AOL-Time Warner merger, which left shareholders in the combined company—including employees such as Mr. Bewkes—in a lurch after AOL’s business collapsed. Much has changed in the media landscape since the AOL-Time Warner marriage unraveled, Mr. Bewkes spun off Time Warner Cable and even since he rebuffed Fox’s takeover offer. For Mr. Bewkes, selling now could turn out to be a shrewd bet, given the uncertainty of the media business. Cord-cutting has so far only been a relatively minor drag on industry results. It is the threat of future disruption that is the most potent overhang on media stocks, and it is unclear when the pace of change will accelerate. Within Time Warner, CNN is enjoying a huge viewership boost, with a doubling of its ratings year-over-year because of interest in the presidential election, but retaining that audience when the political circus subsides will be a huge challenge. Meanwhile, the company has long-term investments for the rights to carry MLB and NBA games via TBS and TNT that have long looked like sure bets, as sports have been more immune to ratings pressure. But cracks have appeared in the NFL’s viewership this season, raising questions about whether sports TV may face a reckoning. HBO continues to be a creative and financial juggernaut but competition with Netflix Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Showtime, FX and others to work with top talent is only intensifying by the year. If completed, Dallas-based AT&T would rely on television and media for more than 40% of its revenue, based on second-quarter financial results, strongly diversifying the company away from a U.S. wireless business that has become increasing competitive. Mr. Stephenson has been reshaping AT&T’s strategy in recent years, particularly since consolidation in the wireless sector hasn’t left room for major deals. AT&T’s attempt to buy T-Mobile was killed by regulators in 2011. With its newfound scale from the DirecTV acquisition, AT&T spent the past year aggressively negotiating deals with content owners and plans to launch an over-the-top video service by year’s end, which would allow users to stream programming over the Web without the need for a satellite dish. Owning Time Warner would give AT&T assets that would help along those streaming media ambitions. For AT&T, the deal would eclipse DirecTV and may be its biggest acquisition since paying $85 billion for BellSouth in 2006. With $117.3 billion in long-term debt at the end of June, buying Time Warner could give AT&T a huge balance sheet with debt hitting almost $200 billion, according to analysts at New Street Research. The issuance of new stock, a common move in AT&T’s deal making, increases its total dividend costs, above the almost $12 billion in current annual payouts.

Facebook Giveaways Contest Rules Photos Contact Select Page AT&T pagará 85.400 millones de dólares por el grupo Time Warner Posted by Online News Editor | Oct 22, 2016 EEUU EMPRESAS Nueva York, 22 oct (EFE).- Time Warner, que lleva siete años desprendiéndose de distintas compañías del conglomerado, quedará finalmente en manos del grupo de telecomunicaciones AT&T, que aceptó hoy pagar 85.400 millones de dólares por la firma, sin incluir deuda asumida. El acuerdo fue anunciado por AT&T y Time Warner en un comunicado conjunto, que pone fin a una serie de informaciones que venían filtrándose desde el viernes y que habían puesto en alerta a los mercados bursátiles. Se trata de la fusión mayor que se anuncia este año, y los expertos no descartan que pueda abrir el paso a otras operaciones, aunque será difícil que se llegue a corto plazo a los montos anunciados hoy. De acuerdo con el comunicado conjunto, AT&T, el mayor grupo del sector en Estados Unidos, pagará 107,50 dólares por cada título de Time Warner, lo que valora la compañía en 85.400 millones de dólares. Pero el monto es mayor si se considera la deuda de Time Warner que asume el comprador, lo que elevaría la cuantía a 108.700 millones de dólares, aunque puede haber una renegociación en algunos de los términos de esos compromisos de deuda. Cada accionista de Time Warner recibirá en efectivo la mitad del valor de cada título que posea y el resto en acciones de AT&T. Este grupo de telecomunicaciones, con tres décadas de existencia, tiene una capitalización bursátil de unos 233.000 millones de dólares, un poco menos que el principal grupo bancario de Estados Unidos, JP Morgan Chase. Se trata del paso más importante que acomete en los últimos años AT&T y que sigue a su decisión, en 2014, de comprar el proveedor de televisión por satélite DirecTV por 49.000 millones de dólares, lo que le convirtió en líder mundial en televisión de pago. Para Time Warner, en cambio, representa en final de una serie de operaciones que han ido mermando el poder de ese grupo desde 2009, en un proceso llevado a cabo en medio de una fuerte crisis en el sector. Fue en 2009 cuando Time Warner se desprendió de la distribuidora de cable Time Warner Cable y ese mismo año anunció su separación de la firma AOL, que llegó a marcar una época en los orígenes de internet en Estados Unidos. Y en 2014 anunció que se desprendía también de la firma Time Inc., editora de la revista del mismo nombre. Pero ahora aporta a la fusión, entre otras marcas, las cadenas de televisión CNN y TNT, los canales HBO y TBS y los estudios Warner Bros, además de derechos televisivos en importantes acontecimientos deportivos. El precio de 107,50 dólares por cada acción de Time Warner está por encima de los 80 dólares en los que estaban los títulos de esa compañía antes de que comenzaran a filtrarse las informaciones sobre las negociaciones entre los empresarios de los dos grupos. Al cierre del viernes en Wall Street, los títulos de Time Warner terminaron con un avance del 7,82 %, mientras que los de AT&T perdieron un 3 %, en el lógico retroceso del valor de los títulos de la firma compradora en operaciones como la anunciada hoy. “Tenemos la intención de dar a los clientes una selección inigualable, calidad, valor y experiencias que definan el futuro de los medios las telecomunicaciones”, afirmó el presidente de AT&T, Randall Stpehenson. Por su parte, el máximo directivo de Time Warner, Jeff Bewkes, coincidió en que la operación es “un paso natural entre dos empresas con grandes legados de innovación”. En su comunicado, AT&T anuncia que el acuerdo está pendiente de ser aprobado por los accionistas de la compañía y de la revisión por parte de las autoridades reguladoras. De momento, sin embargo, han comenzado a surgir reservas sobre el acuerdo. En un mitin en el que participó hoy, el candidato presidencial republicano, Donald Trump, aseguró que, de llegar a la Casa Blanca tras las elecciones del 8 de noviembre, intentará bloquear el acuerdo. “Acuerdos como éste destruyen la democracia”, afirmó el magnate neoyorquino.

The deal caps AT&T Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Randall Stephenson’s vision to expand into media and entertainment as his company’s wireless, internet and pay-TV services businesses mature. Gaining premium cable channel HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros. studio means AT&T becomes a content owner rather than just a distributor of video -- giving it extra reach amid disruptive changes in the ways that viewers decide what, and how, to watch. “Having scale, reach and diversity of assets might offer the greatest protection of all,” said Walt Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG LLC in New York. That scale also may invite extra regulatory scrutiny to the deal. The pairing faces a potentially rocky path through Washington as the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees both express suspicion of blockbuster transactions. The cash-and-stock deal values Time Warner at about $107.50 a share, the companies said Saturday in a statement, 20 percent more than Friday’s closing price. Time Warner shareholders are to receive $53.75 a share in cash and $53.75 a share in AT&T stock. The transaction is valued at $108.7 billion including Time Warner’s net debt. Executive Meetings Senior executives of the companies had met in recent weeks to discuss business strategies and an agreement was near as of Friday, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the talks. The acquisition comes a little more than a year after Dallas-based AT&T became the largest U.S. pay-TV distributor when it completed its $48.5 billion purchase of satellite-TV provider DirecTV. “When we first discussed this we thought it might be unique enough and worthy of investigating whether we could put the two companies together and create something different,” Stephenson said on a conference call Saturday night to discuss the deal. Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst at New Street Research in New York, called the combination “an awkward marriage.” AT&T, rooted in a century-old telecommunications system, is attempting to pair a more stodgy culture with one that has a distinctly more dynamic New York media and Hollywood mindset. One of the largest corporate employers in the country with some 281,000 workers at the end of last year, AT&T posted 2015 revenue of $146.8 billion. Time Warner, with almost 25,000 employees, reported revenue of $28.1 billion. Political Environment Cultural distinctions aside, the marriage is also sure to prompt close review by regulators and by rivals, some of whom may now be compelled to consider deals of their own. The merger is subject to approval by Time Warner shareholders as well as review by the U.S. Justice Department, and is expected to close by year-end 2017. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has complained about concentration power at media companies, said Saturday that he would look at blocking the combination if elected. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s running mate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press’ that he shared “concerns and questions” raised by fellow Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota. Franken, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement on Saturday that huge media mergers “can lead to higher costs, fewer choices, and even worse service for consumers.” "A transaction of this magnitude obviously warrants very close regulatory scrutiny," a spokeswoman for Walt Disney Co. said. Deal Terms Once the deal closes, Time Warner shareholders will own between 14.4 percent and 15.7 percent of AT&T shares. AT&T expects the deal to be accretive in the first year and sees $1 billion in annual cost synergies within three years of closing. AT&T has commitments for a bridge loan of $40 billion to finance part of the cash portion of the deal, according to the statement. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is contributing $25 billion of the financing, with Bank of America Corp. providing the rest, according to a person familiar with the arrangement. The proposed deal calls for Time Warner to pay about a $1.72 billion breakup fee, and AT&T to pay $500 million, a separate person said. “This is going to supercharge our creative abilities, allow us to experiment more and it gives us more financial heft,” Time Warner Chairman and CEO Jeff Bewkes said on the call. “It will attract more cutting-edge projects and talent, so we are going full steam ahead.” Changing Consumers Time Warner’s huge entertainment offering gives AT&T new revenue streams at a time when subscribers to traditional pay-TV are cutting the cord and switching to cheaper “skinny bundles” like Dish Network Corp.’s Sling TV or to online services such as Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. To keep its wireless customers from switching to lower-priced rivals T-Mobile US Inc. and Sprint Corp., AT&T has offered packages of unlimited mobile data and TV service. Time Warner will represent about 15 percent of the combined company’s revenues. The deal comes two years after Time Warner’s Bewkes and his board rejected an $85-a-share offer from Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox Inc., which valued Time Warner at the time at more than $75 billion. Original Programming In the interim, Bewkes has focused on creating must-see original programming and acquiring sports rights to draw TV viewers and extract higher fees from AT&T and other distributors such as Comcast Corp. Time Warner also owns a 10 percent stake in web-streaming service Hulu LLC, for which it paid $583 million earlier this year, according to people with knowledge of that deal. Bewkes, 64, will stay at the combined company for a transition period after the deal, he said on a conference call Saturday. No specific time has been set for how long he’ll stay. He acknowledged Time Warner’s checkered dealmaking history, including its disastrous merger with America Online Inc. in 2000. “Time Warner has been through many combinations, many historic,” Bewkes said. “The first one Time and Warner, and then we added Turner, and then we did have a misstep of course with AOL. We are feeling very positive about this.” In the second quarter, Time Warner’s Turner cable network had revenue of $3 billion, while HBO posted sales of $1.5 billion, and the Warner Bros. studio, producer of the “Harry Potter” franchise, “The Big Bang Theory” and DC Comics properties, had sales of $2.7 billion. Time Warner also has an airwaves license for a TV station in Atlanta, which could give the FCC jurisdiction to scrutinize the deal if that license is transferred to AT&T. They potentially could sell the station to escape FCC scrutiny.  The FCC’s newer rules have restricted growth for carriers in the telecom world. That’s driven them to integrate other businesses like television and media, Roger Entner, an analyst with Recon Analytics LLC in Dedham, Massachusetts, said in an interview before the deal was announced. “The wildcard in all this will be the FCC,” Entner said. “It’s hard to predict what the regulators will do. They are pretty much starting with a blank page.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The rise of the (truly awful) webcam job interview The News Journal 4:52 p.m. EDT October 22, 2016 Heidi Soltis-Berner (Photo: PROVIDED) The future of job interviews might horrify you. It horrified Jake Rosen. A recent graduate of UCLA, Rosen was applying to be a page at NBC when he learned he wouldn't be going to an office to talk to a human being about his skills. Instead, he interviewed by webcam, on a laptop. So Skype, right? Nope, nothing as personal as that. He recorded his answers and sent them back to a hiring manager at NBC for review at the company's convenience. It's the robo-interview, and it goes something like this. In the more humane experience, a hiring manager, who also isn't all that practiced in the art of digital video, delivers taped questions. Or, if it's truly Mr. Roboto, a question pops up on the screen. You have a limited amount of time to answer. You talk to your computer, record the responses, and send them back to the company. Sometimes there's a practice question to get prospective employees used to talking to a camera. Sometimes there isn't. Often, at the end, you have the chance to re-record your answers. For shy people, it may be a dream come true. No firm handshake needed, and sure, you smell fine. And wouldn't we all love the redo option after making up an answer and mumbling it, too? For everyone else, it's awkward at best. It's a pretty slick encounter, a little like FaceTime, except you're forced to stare at your big, nervous face as you wax on about why you want to work at the company. It feels more like performing for an invisible audience than having a conversation, because that's essentially what it is. Not used to being on camera, Rosen felt flustered from the first question, which colored the rest of his interview, he said. DELAWAREONLINE Official: Wilmington traffic signs exceeded trial period DELAWAREONLINE Christie's auctioning Delaware man's 'holy grail of wines' "I'm not a YouTube star, obviously," he said. "It's such a weird experience talking to a camera. It honestly was pretty horrible." Jamie Black, who suffered through the video interview experience for a job at a school, said it felt "more like a game show than an interview." For many of us, the experience will soon be unavoidable. The human-free video job interview is on the rise. HireVue, one of a handful of companies making video interview software, works with 600 large organizations, including Deloitte, JPMorgan Chase, Under Armour, and most of the major U.S. airlines. This year, the company will do 2.5 million interviews, up from 13,000 five years ago. Nearly 90 percent of those are "on demand" interviews, with nobody live at the other end. For a hiring manager, the draw of the video interview is mainly efficiency. "Companies want to get to know way more people," said Mark Newman, the founder of HireVue. A recruiter can only get through so many 30-minute conversations in a day. And that doesn't take into account time lost to scheduling or on bad candidates. With a video interview, human resources staff members only have to review the answers, and can do so on their own schedule, without having to travel for on-campus recruiting. Using HireVue, Hilton got its hiring cycle down to 4.5 days, almost 20 days shorter than the average interview process. All of this saves companies money. Cigna has cut travel expenses for recruiters from $1 million a year, in some cases, to under $100,000. For the job candidate, the benefit of robo-recruiting is convenience-and that's about it. Generally, a company will give an interviewee a day or two to complete the interview, which can happen anywhere. That might sound like another plus, but for Rosen it only added to his stress. "You start to think about things you wouldn't normally think about in interviews. I started thinking about my surroundings," Rosen said. "I had to find a blank wall to sit in front of. ... Should I put a bookshelf behind me? A plant?" Recruiters say they don't judge candidates on their performance, appearance, or locale. "Judging is an interesting word," said Heidi Soltis-Berner, the managing director for talent at Deloitte. "I would say the on-demand interview is truly for fact sharing." Other recruiters said they do evaluate people on their communication abilities and eye contact. Even if hiring managers are instructed not to make decisions on how well a potential new employee can perform in front of a camera (which is a bit hard to believe), the whole setup can be trying. "You just see yourself and a stopwatch ticking down," said Black, who said his answers often got cut off by the timer. If and when he has to do it again, Black said, he would practice in front of a mirror with a stopwatch before the interview. Rosen said it might help to have someone sit behind the computer, as the interview happens, so it's like talking to a person instead of a screen. Just look at the camera so your focus isn't off. The best advice might be to just relax. "It's OK to come across as uncomfortable in front of the camera, because everyone is," said Scott Mitchell, a recruiter for American Wedding Group, which uses video interviews to prescreen the 1,900 independent contractors it works with. "We all assume you're going to be uncomfortable. We're putting you in an uncomfortable position." The robo-interview hasn't replaced human interaction completely. Many companies use it as a replacement for first-round screening interviews, followed by more traditional one-on-ones. But for interviewees who would rather go back to the old way ... that's not happening. Organizations can look at more people, and a more diverse set of people, with the video interviews, and save money on top of that. "Candidates will generally say, 'I would have preferred an in-person interview to this,' but that's not the right comparison," HireVue's Newman said. "The alternative is no interview at all."

Ogg October 22, 2016 10:55 am EST Print Email Tweet The week of October 21 had quite a few developments in the market and in the oil patch, with West Texas Intermediate crude managing to close at $50.85. That is the third week in a row with crude oil ending above $50, and with rig counts still rising, maybe it is no surprise that Federal Reserve survey showed more positive views by energy executives. Investors are continuing to look for opportunities in the oil and gas sector. It is important to understand that many of these oil stocks have recovered handily from their lows. Some of these companies remain under extreme duress, while others are as much as 100% to 200% off of their panic-induced bottoms seen in late 2015 or early 2016. The week of October 21 brought several key analyst calls looking for handy upside in the oil and gas sector. 24/7 Wall St. tracks many of the analyst upgrades and downgrades to find new ideas each day and week, but keep in mind that there is no such thing as a free lunch in investing. Other positive issues have been seen in oil and gas, with rig counts now up 16 for the past 17 weeks. Banks are reporting that their exposure to risk for energy defaults has largely subsided. Even the credit ratings agencies have suggested that the worst of the bankruptcies are likely behind. Here are eight very positive analyst calls in the oil and gas sector for the week of October 21. Again, analysts are not always right and sometimes they just make the wrong assumptions. Continental Resources Inc. (NYSE: CLR) was raised to Overweight from Equal Weight with a $60 price target at Barclays on October 17. The prior closing price was $51.78, and Harold Hamm’s company ended the week at $52.85. The stock has a 52-week trading range of $13.94 to $55.07 and a consensus analyst price target of $56.22. Halliburton Co. (NYSE: HAL) was also chased up after earnings by analysts. Halliburton saw price target or ratings changes from the likes of Barclays, BMO, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Nomura and others (see full coverage). Halliburton now has a consensus price target up at $55.17, almost $4 higher than a month ago. Shares closed out the week at $48.43, in a 52-week range of $27.64 to $50.23. Kinder Morgan Inc. (NYSE: KMI) had a solid week after earnings indicated a higher dividend is likely to return in 2017. It received multiple analyst upgrades, with ratings upgrades from the likes of Stifel, Wolfe Research and Credit Suisse. It also received price target boosts from at least five other firms over the course of the week. Merrill Lynch raised its rating to Outperform from Neutral and raised its target to $25 in a re-upgrade (see full coverage). Shares ended the week at $21.11. The consensus price target is now up about a dollar from a month ago to $24.26. The 52-week range is $11.20 to $28.54. RSP Permian Inc. (NYSE: RSPP) already had made news this month by paying $2.4 billion to acquire Silver Hill, and it raised cash to pay for the deal. If the analysts on Wall Street are remotely close to accurate, this may be one of the Permian Basin’s cheapest oil stocks. On October 17 we saw many analysts defend the deal and raise targets (see full coverage). After closing at $41.03, this ended up down over 2% on the week, but still standing strong. RSP Permian now has a 52-week range of $16.74 to $43.30, and its consensus price target of $49.10 is up almost $5 from a month ago and up almost $10 from 90 days ago. Tenaris S.A. (NYSE: TS) was raised to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $33 at Piper Jaffray on October 18. It had previously closed at $28.80, and the price on Friday’s close was $28.99. This may not be your typical oil company, based on prices, but it is into steel pipe products and other related services for the oil and gas industry. It also hit a 52-week high this week. Western Refining Inc. (NYSE: WNR) was raised to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on October 19. The stock closed at $28.07 ahead of the call but went out on Friday at $30.61. The 52-week range is $18.14 to $47.55, and the consensus price target is $27.73. Gulfport Energy Corp. (NASDAQ: GPOR) was raised to Buy from Neutral with a $35 price target (versus a $27.61 prior close) at Goldman Sachs on October 18. Shares closed down 2.5% at $26.51 on Friday, and that was down from closer to $30.00 at the start of the week. Still, the consensus price target of $35.18 implies handy upside. Oasis Petroleum Inc. (NYSE: OAS) was raised to Overweight from Neutral with a $16 price target at Piper Jaffray on October 19. The prior closing price was $10.57, but even with a 1.5% drop on Friday, it closed out the week at $11.42. For an opposite view: Goldman Sachs downgraded Oasis to Sell from Neutral with an $8.50 target just a day earlier.

Other partners in the network include Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Senrigan Capital and HedgeServ, Hazeltree said in a statement.

The Week Staff AP Photo/Susan Walsh, file October 22, 2016 ADVERTISEMENT Sign Up for Our free email newsletters 10 things you need to know today Today's best articles The week's best photojournalism Today's top cartoons Daily business briefing The smartest insight and analysis, from all perspectives, rounded up from around the web: Looks like "Wall Street got something right for once," said Tim Mullaney at Market​Watch. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf abruptly resigned last week, forced into retirement by devastating revelations that employees secretly created some 2 million fraudulent accounts in order to meet unrealistic sales quotas. The banking giant had already fired some 5,000 workers over the scandal, but as it became clear that the malfeasance was rooted deep in Wells' corporate culture, "accountability needed to be had at the top." Finally, a banking executive is taking the fall for his company's misdeeds, said Helaine Olen in Slate. Why is this time different? JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon, for instance, still has his job despite the fact that lax oversight allowed rogue traders at his bank to lose more than $6 billion during the 2012 "London Whale" debacle. But while that scandal involved byzantine financial instruments like credit-default swaps, Wells' wrongdoing felt different, partly because it directly affected ordinary consumers. "It wasn't just that Wells Fargo expressed almost breathtaking contempt for its customers; it did it in a way they could easily understand." Even with Stumpf gone, "the pain likely isn't over" for the bank, said Christina Rexrode at The Wall Street Journal. Federal prosecutors are still weighing civil and criminal charges against Wells for its aggressive sales practices, while several state attorneys general are conducting their own investigations. Stumpf himself was stripped of $41 million in compensation before he resigned, and could stand to lose more; other Wells executives could face pay clawbacks as well. Then there are looming class-action lawsuits from both employees and investors. But overall, Wells Fargo "is in decent condition," said The Economist staff. The bank weathered the financial crisis much better than its competitors, remains profitable, and has a strong balance sheet. Even so, Wells' scandal could not have come at a worse time — in the middle of an election season marked by populist fervor. In this environment, even scandals that would once have been regarded as minor can quickly "spiral out of control." If only for PR purposes, "Wells Fargo needs to make a clean break with the past," said Gretchen Morgenson at The New York Times. So far, that doesn't appear to be happening. Timothy Sloan, the bank's president and former chief operating officer, is taking Stumpf's place as CEO. Shareholders can fairly ask, "Is Sloan, an almost 30-year veteran of Wells Fargo and a seasoned insider, the best executive to lead the bank out of crisis?" The answer is, probably not. Wells doesn't need small, incremental tweaks right now. It needs a "do-over to repair the damage." For now, though, let's celebrate this "all-too-rare example of corporate governance working the way it should," said James Stewart, also at the Times. Stumpf was forced out within a week of his embarrassing appearances before congressional panels, in which he laid blame for the scandal on low-level employees, instead of taking responsibility himself. "Ultimately the buck should stop with the chief executive — a simple truth that many boards often ignore." For once, "the buck stopped where it should have."

Photo: Reuters Hacker had recently released code that powers malwaretargeting the ‘Internet of Things’ mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:00 AM, October 24, 2016 LONDON — Vulnerable Internet-connected devices such as cameras and digital video recorders may be to blame for the attack that took down some of the world’s most popular websites on Friday. Malware that targets the “Internet of Things”, a new breed of small gadgets that are connected to the Internet, may have powered the global attack, according to Mr Brian Krebs, a well-known journalist covering computer security. Poorly secured devices may have been compromised and turned into a “botnet” that powered the attack, he wrote. Millions of Internet users lost access to some of the world’s most popular websites on Friday as hackers hammered servers along the US East Coast with phony traffic until they crashed, then moved westward. The attackers hit Dyn, a provider of Domain Name System services, taking down sites including Twitter, Spotify, Reddit, CNN, Etsy and The New York Times for long periods of time. By Friday evening, Dyn said it had stopped the hacks. “As you can imagine, it has been a crazy day,” Dyn spokesman Adam Coughlin wrote in an email. “At this moment (knock on wood), service has been restored.” Security professionals have been anticipating more attacks from malware that targets the “Internet of Things” since a hacker released software code that powers such malware, called Mirai, several weeks ago. Mr Kyle York, chief strategy officer of Dyn, said the hackers launched a so-called distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack using “tens of millions” of malware-infected devices connected to the Internet. Ms Gillian Christensen, a spokeswoman for the US Department of Homeland Security, said the agency and the FBI are aware of the incidents and “investigating all potential causes”. Dyn first reported site outages relating to the DDoS attack about 7.10am (New York time) on Friday. The company restored service two hours later, but was offline again about noon, as another attack appeared to be under way, this time affecting the West Coast as well. While DDoS attacks do not steal anything, they create havoc across the Internet — and are on the increase in volume and power. Sites as far away as Australia were affected by a second wave of attacks th at began about 1am (Sydney time) on Saturday and lasted about five hours, said Mr Dave Anderson, a London-based vice-president of marketing at Dynatrace, which monitors the performance of websites. At the peak of the attack, the average DNS connect times for 2,000 websites monitored by Dynatrace went to about 16 seconds from 500 milliseconds normally. “I have never seen severity this big, impacting so many sites and lasting such a prolonged period of time,” said Mr Anderson in an interview. “It just shows how vulnerable and interconnected the world is, and when something happens in one region, it impacts every other region.” Dynatrace’s analytics are not able to trace the source of the attacks, said Mr Anderson. Earlier on Friday in the US, Mr Krebs wrote that the timing of the attacks corresponded with the release of research conducted by Dyn’s director of Internet analysis. Dyn highlighted potential connections between firms that offer to protect against DDoS attacks, and the hackers who conduct them. Mr Krebs’s own website faced an “extremely large and unusual” DDoS attack after he published a story based on the same research, he said. “We can’t confirm or even speculate on anyone’s motivation or relation to that research,” said Mr Dave Allen, Dyn’s general counsel. With attacks on the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS), hackers compromise the underlying technology that governs how the Web functions, making the hack far more powerful and widespread. The DNS translates website names into the Internet Protocol addresses that computers use to look up and access sites. But it has a design flaw: Sending a routine data request to a DNS server from one computer, the hacker can trick the system into sending a monster file of IP addresses back to the intended target. Multiply that by tens of thousands of computers under the hackers’ control, and the wall of data that flooded back was enormous. A small server may be capable of handling hundreds of simultaneous requests, but thousands every minute cause overload and ultimately shut it down, taking the websites it hosts offline with it. The practice is often employed by groups of hackers. In 2012,a DDoS attack forced offline the websites of Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup, Wells Fargo & Co, US Bancorp and PNC Financial Services Group. A DDoS can be achieved in a number of ways but commonly involves a distributed network of so-called “zombie” machines, referred to as botnets. A botnet is formed with computers and other connected devices in homes or offices infected with malicious code, which, upon the request of a hacker, can flood a web server with data. One or two machines would not be an issue, but if tens or hundreds of thousands fire such data simultaneously, it can cripple even the most sophisticated web servers. In the case of the Dyn incident, the computers targeted were DNS servers. Without a DNS server, large numbers of websites are inaccessible by users across a country or even the world. In other words, taking away the DNS servers is like taking away all the road signs on a country’s highway system. So-called “authoritative” DNS providers such as Dyn are notoriously hard to secure. Mr Carl Herberger, vice-president for security solutions at Radware, an Israeli-based Internet security company, likens “authoritative” DNS providers to hospitals that must admit anyone who shows up at the emergency room. Dyn must consider traffic going to a website as initially legitimate. In the event of a DDoS, Dyn must work quickly to sort out the bad traffic from the good, which takes time and resources, and creates outages that ripple across the Internet, as was the case on Friday. Mr Dave Palmer, director of technology at UK cyber-security company Darktrace, said the most recent DDoS attacks have been linked to Internet-of-Things devices, in particular, webcams. “The joke about the Internet of Things was that you were going to get people hijacking people’s connected fridges to conduct these attacks, but in these recent cases, the culprit seems to be webcams,” said Mr Palmer. “We will probably see, when this is investigated, that it is a botnet of the Internet of Things.” To avoid massive outages, companies ramp up their capacity to try to absorb the deluge of traffic and reroute it, often with the help of a major telecommunications carrier or cloud-services provider such as Akamai Technologies or CloudFlare. But the only way to really prevent denial-of-service attacks may be to increase the overall security level of consumers around the world, said Mr Palmer, a task that is getting harder as more devices are connected to the Internet. “This is exactly what happens when tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of devices are left unprotected,” said Mr Palmer.

In one case I remember half a room filled with papers related to just one loan."Monte dei Paschi, Italy's weakest major lender, is under pressure from the European Central Bank to resolve its bad debt problem by the end of the year, but foreign investors have so far shown little enthusiasm in supporting its rescue plan.The arduous work of Protos' engineers shows how the patchy state of loan records at Italian banks is likely to hamper sales of bad debts for some time, despite a regulatory push.Experts say Italian banks may struggle to meet deadlines set by the Bank of Italy to periodically provide very detailed information about bad loans above 100,000 euros."Banks are getting hit from all sides: they don't have the time ... They may be stretched in terms of resources and they can't fix things like their IT system overnight," said Joe Giannamore, head of AnaCap Financial Partners which owns a gross 9 billion euros worth of Italian bad loans."If they don't have information captured centrally in one place, banks face a long, manual and very labour-intensive job." Lenders failed to keep records up to date as Italian bad loans quadrupled following the onset of the financial crisis in 2007. When they came under pressure to sell, they realised their databases lacked much of the information that buyers demanded.DATABASES Protos analysts have what they call their "war rooms", where they take the information dug out from piles of documents and build easy-to-consult databases.High-quality information can improve the selling price of a loan portfolio by up to 10 percent, according to Mazzoni."One important lesson learnt in the disposal is (that) if you have a good database, the price is higher," BPER CEO Alessandro Vandelli said after the bank sold 450 million euros in bad loans in July. This is key as banks normally offload bad debts at a loss. Monte dei Paschi's ambitious recapitalisation would be an even tougher challenge if a lower selling price for its loans had blown a bigger hole in its accounts.To shed the bad debts, Monte dei Paschi is relying on a guarantee provided by the state and a major investment by Atlante, a state-sponsored bailout fund financed by leading Italian financial institutions.Encouragingly, after delving into Monte dei Paschi's bad loans, Atlante last week said the loan quality matched its estimates. Atlante offered in July to pay 1.6 billion euros, or about 27 cents in every euro of face value, for a tranche of the bank's bad loans repackaged as securities.Monte dei Paschi is now awaiting the outcome of a similar review by JPMorgan, which has pledged to provide a 5 billion euro bridge loan to buy time to arrange the state guarantee. OUT-OF-COURT Strong local ties can make Italian banks reluctant to aggressively call in debts, especially small personal loans taken out to buy a car or a washing machine."Banks tread lightly because they don't want to hurt their image or undermine traditionally close ties with the local community," said Carmine Evangelista, CEO of AZ Holding, which specializes in recovering unsecured loans. "When we get a new portfolio we make a first round of calls to let people know their creditor is no longer the bank. This alone normally prompts some repayments," Evangelista added.Banks have managed to sell unsecured loans despite poor data because they have standard market prices. But roughly half of Italy's 200 billion euros in loans to insolvent borrowers is secured against real estate, according to accountancy firm PwC.To sell or recover those loans, accurate data are essential. For example, the bank or the loan's new owners may find it necessary to relaunch an unfinished property development on land that was pledged as collateral.That can be a big decision, given a 15 percent drop in Italian house prices over the past four years.The least efficient way to recover bad loans in Italy is to take borrowers to court where, on average, bankruptcy proceedings drag on for 7.8 years. "It's vital to seek out-of-court deals with borrowers ... Banks don't do that enough," Riccardo Serrini, CEO of bad loan manager Prelios Credit Servicing, said.($1 = 0.9096 euros) (Reporting by Valentina Za; Editing by Gareth Jones) This story has not been edited by Firstpost staff and is generated by auto-feed.
