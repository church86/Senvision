Corrado Passera, who as well as being a former industry minister served as chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo, is working with private equity firms including Warburg Pincus on a plan that includes a reserved capital increase of 2.0-2.5 billion euros, the sources said. Two of the sources said none of the funds approached by Passera had committed to backing the plan and while they were open to doing a deal, this was subject to due diligence. Another source said no deal was imminent. It is far from certain that Monte dei Paschi will turn to Passera, who was not immediately available for comment, or that his scheme would stand a better chance of success than JPMorgan's, one of the sources said. And a source close to the JPMorgan-led consortium of investment banks said they were pressing ahead with their plan and were confident it would succeed. OLDEST BUT WEAKEST The sources said private equity funds who have been working with Passera trust his ability to turn around the Siena-based bank, the world's oldest, which in July emerged as the weakest lender in the latest round of European stress tests. Monte dei Paschi's board rejected in July a last-minute attempt by Passera to put forward a rescue plan backed by Swiss investment bank UBS, a long-standing adviser to the Tuscan bank. It approved instead the privately-backed rescue arranged by JPMorgan with the help of Mediobanca. However, the deal has since ran into trouble, senior bankers say. A preliminary survey of investors over the summer found scant interest in a third cash call in as many years, while analysts have questioned the feasibility of a capital raising that totals 10 times the bank's current market value. Last month, Monte dei Paschi abruptly replaced chief executive Fabrizio Viola with the head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Italy, Marco Morelli, in the hope of winning investors confidence and is now studying a debt-to-equity conversion to cut the size of the share sale. JPMorgan is also looking for investors to back a reserved share sale but has yet to find any, several sources said. Recent talks with a sovereign wealth fund fell through, one of the sources said, raising fears the bank may need state aid. Most foreign investors are unwilling to commit any cash until a Dec. 4 referendum on constitutional reform that could unseat Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's government, bankers say. "No investment committee will ever approve a deal for Monte dei Paschi without knowing the outcome of the Italian referendum," an investor close to the bank said.

Who We Are About the Magazine Irish America Team Our Contributors In This Issue Archives Hall of Fame The Lists Business 100 Wall Street 50 Health and Life Sciences 50 Top 50 Power Women Top 100 Stars of the South Blog Events Travel Gift Shop Dan Keegan: Thriving as a Leader in Changing Times Daniel Keegan is Citigroup's co-head of Global Equities and the 2016 Irish America Wall Street 50 Keynote Speaker. (Photo: Kit DeFever) By Adam Farley, Deputy Editor October / November 2016 As Wall Street remaps its understanding of the markets, Daniel Keegan, co-head of Global Equities at Citigroup, is leading the way, shepherding his company through wholly novel and unprecedented conditions. ℘℘℘ One of the most influential leaders on Wall Street, Dan Keegan is a third-generation Irish American with roots in west County Meath and Cork on his father’s side, and just outside of Dublin on his mother’s. He is a devout Catholic, a proud member of a large Irish American family, and a life-long supporter of Notre Dame. Keegan’s father is an alumnus, so too his three brothers, and when the time came for Dan to go to college, his father told him he could go anywhere, but if he wanted it paid for, he should pack his bags for South Bend. He earned his B.A. in American studies, with concentrations in English, history, and government. Robert Schmuhl, professor of American studies and journalism, taught Keegan as an undergraduate and the two have remained close. He remembers his student’s combination of humor and inquisitiveness. “Curious, smart, personable, he made a winning impression then, and he continues to do so,” he told Irish America. “Laughter is never far away when he’s around, and each day his Irish good humor adds to the gaiety of this nation and others.” Keegan thinks of the markets like a puzzle “that I may never solve, but love working on nonetheless.” (Photo: Kit DeFever) Though Keegan has an abiding interest in history, when he graduated in 1991, he decided to study law, and where better than Notre Dame Law School, the oldest Roman Catholic law school in the nation. His father, a lawyer himself, wasn’t overly enthused at his decision. His advice to Dan was “don’t take notes.” Asked why, his father, he says, told him bluntly, “Others will take better notes, what you really need to learn is how to think.” To this day, Keegan, now 47, says it was the best advice he ever received (even if he didn’t feel that way at the time). “The idea of thinking about how to think, make arguments and defend one’s position is invaluable,” he says. “You can’t make an argument without understanding the other side and, by definition, understanding the other side implies that you’re listening and are committed to understanding every aspect of the debate.” After graduating, Keegan worked with his father’s law firm where he gained experience in general legal matters on a variety of topics ranging from personal injury law to family law, but after a year he decided to move on and try something different. Keegan grew up in Rumson, New Jersey, on the Shore, the middle of five children, and graduated high school in 1987. As a kid, he liked puzzles and was fascinated by his father’s Wall Street friends and their work: “I had always been interested in the markets and how they worked. And, so as not to be disingenuous, I admit it took me a long time to really understand them. It was not native, so I found it akin to a puzzle, to a degree, one that I may never solve, but love working on nonetheless.” Having been in the industry for 20 years now, Keegan still maintains that analogy to today’s markets. Still, too, his passion is unflinching, and he attributes much of his success to that puzzle-solving drive and hard work: first at Salomon Brothers in 1996 as a research sales assistant in Chicago, then with JPMorgan in San Francisco during the dot com boom, then back to Chicago in 2000, and back again to San Francisco in 2001 after the bubble burst. In 2002, JPMorgan asked him to move to New York to start a business for them in electronic trading. He later moved to Automated Trading Desk, which was acquired by Citi in 2007. He has been there ever since and has “the scar tissue to prove it,” he jokes, having weathered the 2008 financial crisis, the 2010 flash crash (during which the Dow dropped almost 1,000 points in just over half an hour), and countless other minor crises. Dan’s parents, Diane and John. (Courtesy Dan Keegan) He is analytical and not prone to hyperbole, so when he says today’s markets are unique in historical terms, you believe him: “It’s a fascinating time as global central bank coordination has pushed rates and volatility to unprecedented levels, all the while forcing investors out on the risk curve.” Because of that, no two days on the street are the same, he says, “and just when you think that you’ve got it figured out, the market serves up a big old piece of humble pie. Rest assured, I have had my fair share of said pie over the years.” That humility and an early passion for sports has left him with some natural leadership qualities including team building and making decisions under pressure that have helped his career. For him, it is now more about analyzing the game and its ancillary aspects to the simple dichotomy of winning or losing: “I love sports not just for the sport itself but for all the other things that come with it – competition, confidence, failure, the need for resiliency, and, of course, teamwork.” Basketball was his early passion, but, in his own words, “a slow first step and shaky jump shot” led to an abrupt end to his career on the court. Nonetheless, his passion for sports continues unabated. These days, Keegan, who bears a striking resemblance to Brian Kelly, Notre Dame’s legendary football coach, has switched his focus to golf, and he loves to golf in Ireland. His favorite place to play is Ballybunion Golf Club, in County Kerry. One of the most beautiful courses in the world with spectacular views of the ocean and grassy dunes, the old links course is also one of the most challenging. And Keegan loves a challenge, be it on the golf course or on Wall Street. “It is a very special feeling when you can bring a team together and that team collectively can accomplish something its members may have initially thought unachievable.” Keegan, second from right, golfing with friends in Ireland. (Courtesy Dan Keegan) Citigroup is one of the world’s largest financial conglomerates and the global equities division that Keegan oversees with his co-head, Murray Roos, is a huge part of the business with 1,000 employees. The market never sleeps, and this means that Keegan’s days are long, too. He is up at 5:30 a.m. and in the office by 6:30 if he’s not at a breakfast or traveling. At nights, after family time, he works until about midnight. He doesn’t mind it though. According to him, “very rarely does it feel like work.” Keegan met his wife, Elizabeth, at Notre Dame, where they dated in their senior year. They reunited in the late ’90s, married in 2000, and now have four children – a son, Danny (15), and three daughters, Rosemary (“Roey,” 13), Margaret (“Meg,” 11), and Katherine (10). It is clear in listening to him that his wife and kids take precedence over all else, a vestige of how he remembers his own upbringing (and parents in particular). “As frustrating as I probably was to my parents, and as strict as I might have perceived them to be in certain instances, they never quit. They never gave up on me,” he says. “I think that is the most important thing in parenting. While they never hesitated in holding me accountable for the mistakes I made, they never turned away from me either; everything was perceived as a teaching moment.” Keegan with his wife Elizabeth and their children, from left, Katherine, Roey, Meg, and Danny. (Photo: Ebert Studio / Courtesy Dan Keegan) But when it comes to kids and parenting, there’s always time for fun, especially if there’s a history or life-lesson involved. Fitting for a man involved in the cash business, Keegan loves Hamilton, the biographical musical about Alexander Hamilton, father of the national banking system and founder of the First Bank of the United States. He has been to see the show several times and it’s also a big hit with his kids. It’s important to him that his children are exposed to the arts and different cultures, and he recently took the family on a trip to China, which he says was not only educational, but also character-building. He has also taken them to Ireland. For his father’s 65th birthday in 2000, Keegan and his siblings surprised him by joining the celebration in Ireland. It was Dan’s first time in the country and he loved it. Since, he has gone back several times to play golf with friends. Most recently, he took his family to Dublin in 2012 for the Notre Dame v. Navy football game. It was his children’s first time in Ireland, and his third child, Meg, looking around, turned to Keegan and said, “Dad, I can see why this is where you’re from!” Keegan, who couldn’t pretend to be anything but Irish, was incredulous and almost offended, knowing his Hibernian features all too well. “What does that mean?” “No, I mean everyone’s the same!” True to form, Keegan, convinced no offense was intended, acquiesced and laughed. “You’re right. We all kind of look the same.” However true it may be with respect to Irish looks, it’s anything but on the trading floor, where Keegan distinguishes himself through measured consideration of issues, decisive execution, and, of course, his Irish good humor. The following is edited for clarity and length. Daniel Keegan. (Photo: Kit DeFever) What is your assessment of the current financial climate? In many ways, we find ourselves in unchartered territory. Quantitative easing around the world has created distortion in financial assets. The equity markets, for example, are approaching all time highs as ultra low rates have forced investors out on the risk curve. While investors remain relatively sanguine about the current set-up, it won’t take much in terms of a change in investor sentiment to introduce a far more volatile environment. What does that mean for you in this role? The macro environment is challenging, which, when coupled with some of the cyclical and secular challenges specific to our business, makes for a difficult operating environment. That being said, our business is focused around clients, namely understanding their needs, anticipating what comes next, and ensuring that we are delivering per their want. As a firm, we are quite unique in our global footprint, increasingly a competitive advantage as service provider capacity comes out of the system. Coupled with a commitment from senior management to invest back against the business, I feel very optimistic about what we can achieve on behalf of our clients over the next several years. How do you and your co-head break up the responsibilities? The co-head structure is new to me but something that I have taken to very quickly. My co-head Murray Roos is a great guy and very talented to boot. Other than the fact that he is younger, better looking and smarter (maybe!), we operate as equals. Having a partner to discuss ideas and challenge assumptions with is very valuable. In terms of the structure itself, we came to the conclusion early on that if this was to work, both of us needed to sign up to do the entire job. As such, we are each jointly and severably liable for the globe and every aspect of the business. Communication, as such, needs to be seamless, something that we focus on everyday. What is your decision-making process? While deliberate in thought, I tend to be decisive when it is time to act and I try to never look back. Exercising sound judgment is a key aspect of the job and many of the decisions made revolve around people where the human element is often on full display. As such, people decisions in particular require an elevated level of transparency such that the entire team understands the core thought process around it, with the want being to move forward. Sometimes no decision is a decision, but when it is time to make a decision, you have to make it. Now, in the context of a co-head structure, there is no decision I make in isolation, but once it’s made there is no looking back. Finally, in the context of decision-making, you can’t be afraid to make mistakes; it is an inevitability, everybody makes mistakes. The key is, once mistakes are identified, to rectify them as promptly as possible. What is your mentorship philosophy towards your employees? The assets in our business go up and down the elevator everyday. Accordingly, investing in our people is of paramount importance. Citi, in particular, I think is very strong in this regard, providing an array of development opportunities that zero in on product knowledge, leadership seminars, on-line training and the like. Moreover, within the business, we provide mentors for new employees that persist long beyond the first few years. Culture too plays a critical role. Creating an environment where people feel comfortable asking questions and/or challenging the norm is an equally important part of developing our people. The more you can get people to engage, the more we can learn from each other while advancing both the individual and the business along the way. How do you build the team in order to maintain that culture? I play a very active role in both recruiting and hiring. I want naturally inquisitive people. I want people who are not afraid to take risks. I want people who hold themselves more accountable than they would otherwise be held and I want people who genuinely want to be around other people and believe more in the value of the team than they do in themselves. On the flip-side, what I don’t want are people who read their own press clippings or who think themselves better than somebody else, whether it be their peer, the bathroom attendant, or the security guard at the front desk. We all work for the same firm. We all have jobs to do. Treating everyone with respect and appreciating the role that they play is a major part of building a winning culture. It does not mean that we don’t hold everyone accountable; we do. But the manner in which you do it matters. How has the industry changed post-crash? The financial crisis was painful in many, many ways and as an industry, we have to be honest with ourselves in terms of the role that we played. Nonetheless, if there is a silver lining to be found, it lies in a heightened awareness of the responsibility that we have to our clients and the broader public at large. Every morning when I arrive, our mission statement is prominently displayed on my desktop (no different than any other employee) and what it speaks to is responsible finance, the need to think first and foremost about our clients, and the obligations that we have to them and each other. You can automate a lot of things away, but you can never automate the way that relationship works. The relationship is ultimately the thing upon which trust is formed and trust, in this industry, is everything. The ultimate litmus test for me centers on my kids ­– whether I would feel comfortable introducing them into the industry. As it stands today, that answer is unequivocally yes. For all of the pain caused, I am proud to tell people what I do for a living and the value we are delivering to society at large. What would you like to see more of in the industry? The industry has changed a great deal post the crisis and I would like to see us promote those changes while speaking more to the role we play in society and the opportunities a career in our industry can provide – the role you can play in helping others. Citi does so much good for cities, towns and municipalities. It is very charitable organization and, in serving clients, plays a prominent role in how our society functions. Should we do more? Yes. Can we do more? Yes. Should we hold ourselves responsible for doing more? Absolutely. But I would like to see us trying to promote the benefits of what comes from having a career in financial services, the impact you can have – whether it is a broker servicing a widow or an institutional salesperson servicing a pension fund that manages money for teachers and unions, whether it is an investment banker servicing a corporate client who is trying to restructure a business that has failed, or whether it is the consumer bank where you are helping consumers around debt forgiveness. We need to make sure we are promoting that specifically in the context of the industry, so that people outside of it know the real value Wall Street creates. Tell me about Notre Dame. What is your relationship with the school like today? Notre Dame is a special place. It is a Catholic University that is recognized the world over for leading the discussion on a range of society’s most pressing issues. The faculty and administration are second to none, the facilities are amazing and the student population is quite unique. Yet Notre Dame is more than that. Notre Dame is a place where all students are challenged to look beyond themselves, to question their place in society and how they can give back. Having spent seven years at Notre Dame, with the good fortune too of having met my wife while there, Notre Dame will forever carry a special place in my heart. How important was your Catholicism to your upbringing? I am very proud to say that I am a Catholic. I went to Catholic grammar school, high school, college, and law school, so religion has always been a big part of my life and shaped my belief system in many ways. For me, it provides perspective and has taught me to focus less on myself and made me more focused on others. At Notre Dame, every dorm has a chapel in it, so irrespective of whether you are Catholic or not, the sense of being part of something that is bigger than you – which is what I think religion speaks to – is very, very powerful and should drive how it is we live our lives. Do you think there is anything you have particularly inherited from your parents? My parents are great. They have taught me much of what I now know. Leading by example, they both work very hard, yet never take themselves too seriously. They are not afraid to laugh at themselves, but never will they laugh at others. They are both exceedingly good people who have provided me great role models to emulate along the way. From a heritage perspective, they taught me how much our ancestors suffered to give us the opportunities that we now have, for the courage of their conviction to make the move. They worked super hard and as a result of that we had a really nice upbringing. That work ethic and making sure that you don’t take shortcuts is something that stuck with me. How do you interact with your own children about their connection to Ireland and their Irish American ancestry? Well, we took them there. You can tell all the stories you want, but there is no substitute for seeing it first hand, learning the history, and coming to appreciate the sacrifices those before you made in giving the opportunities they now have. In particular, touring a replica of the type of ship that transported their ancestors was eye-opening. Ireland has such a rich history, and its unique relationship with America will provide them continued opportunity to understand their heritage in the context of who they are and from where they came. As is the beauty of youth, they are only getting started. How do you address the work-life balance? Life is all about making choices, but striking the “right” balance between work and everything else is not easy. Prioritizing what is most important in your life and managing your time efficiently are key determinants in striking the right balance. I love the people with whom I work; I believe in the firm. So, in and of itself, that provides me a great pleasure, but nothing trumps the pleasure that I get from being with my family. For now, just about everything else needs to take a backseat. What is the most important value for you to teach your children and how do you do it? Like all parents, we want our kids to work hard, have fun, take chances, and not be afraid to fail. Most importantly, we want them to treat everyone the way they would like to be treated. Admittedly that is easier said than done, and the mistakes that they make are often very much on display, requiring a more immediate response or analysis of where they have fallen short. The world in which they are growing up in is quite different from the one I knew as a child. The external pressures that they feel are quite pronounced, the stakes seemingly greater. Accordingly, we try to engage our kids in a dialogue, in some ways to act as an outlet for them to share their challenges. Does it work? Only sometimes, but ensuring that they know there is somewhere to go with their problems is important. In terms of rules, there are many and the consequences for breaking them are swift. However, taking responsibility for their mistakes is critical. Just as they fail, so do we as parents, but so long as we all understand that and try everyday to get better and learn from our mistakes, we are moving in the right direction. Thank you. ♦   One Response to “Dan Keegan: Thriving as a Leader in Changing Times” Peter garland says: October 19, 2016 at 10:05 pm Geez, did he really deserve this much space? It’s boring.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 07, 2016 3:38pm   Comments Share: Related DKS Retail Earnings On The Docket: All The Important Dates You Need To Know Watch These 5 Huge Put Purchases In Monday Trade Fed's Yellen, Salesforce, Cisco, Retailers Lead Investing Action Plan (Investor's Business Daily) Following its meeting with the management of Dicks Sporting Goods Inc (NYSE: DKS), JPMorgan said it already believes the company is getting a significant lift from The Sports Authority (TSA)'s demise. The firm also noted that management expects the benefits to accelerate into the fourth quarter and 2017, as the company leverages purchased intellectual property. Analyst Christopher Horvers said his comp forecasts for the third quarter of 3 percent and fourth quarter of 5.2 percent are ahead of the Street. The third quarter upside, according to the analyst, comes from TSA's liquidation in the second quarter and the Olympics lift. Meanwhile, the combination of weather comparisons and targeted TSA share strategies would boost the fourth quarter. Related Link: The Curious Case Of Bass Pro Shops' Sale JPMorgan also said it did not come off the management meeting doubting that the company's estimate of 25-30 basis point margin benefit from in-sourcing e-commerce operations in 2017 is achievable. The Neutral rating on the shares of the company is due to the fact that the market expectations of the TSA lift is more than that of the firm's. That said, the firm sees a high penetration of tactical investors positioned for the double benefit of TSA's demise and lapping the warmest winter weather in 120 years in the fourth quarter to the first quarter. The firm has a December-2017 price target of $60, unchanged from the December-2016 price target. At time of writing, shares of Dick's were down 0.57 percent at $57.79.

"My slogan: Make America fun again," Dimon told a convention of finance professionals in Washington Friday. The slogan, a riff on the Republican presidential candidate's tagline, is for a presidential run that Dimon said he would like to launch but will not. "I would love to be president," Dimon said, but it won't happen because he doesn't have the necessary political experience and couldn't withstand the process. "We torture those people," he said.

Dimon criticized what he called the "incoherent" economic policy of the U.S. in recent years. "We have failed to collaborate," he said, citing specifically Congress' failure to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the version of comprehensive immigration reform that cleared the Senate in 2013 or long-term fiscal reform. The next president, he said, should "drop the rhetoric" pitting Democrats and Republicans and work on those issues, restoring the public's faith in experts at the same time.

"Brexit makes the chance of the euro zone not surviving 10 years from now five times higher," Dimon said at the Institute of International Finance's 2016 annual membership meeting in Washington. Speaking at the same event, James Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, said that the big winner from Brexit would be New York because business currently carried out in London would shift there.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 07, 2016 1:30pm   Comments Share: Related MACK 18 Stocks Moving In Friday's Pre-Market Session The Market In 5 Minutes: Retail Earnings Come Into Focus The Vetr community has downgraded $MACK to 2.5-Stars (Vetr) JPMorgan has downgraded Merrimack Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: MACK) to Neutral from Overweight and cut the price target to $7 from $8, citing the belief that shares would be range bound in the near to intermediate term amid the company's ongoing strategic review. Earlier this week, Merrimack announced the exit of CEO Robert Mulroy. The company also cut 22 percent of its workforce to save more than $200 million in expected costs over the next two years. Related Link: Merrimack Pharmaceuticals Falls Back To Support Following JPMorgan Downgrade Following are the four reasons behind JPMorgan's downgrade: "Our view that 2016 consensus estimates, while achievable, are perhaps not meaningfully beatable (and 2017 needs to moderate incrementally, in our view)." "Key pipeline catalysts, while underappreciated, are weighted 2Q17+." "Our expectation that R&D prioritization and search for a new CEO could take time (currently no timelines outlined)." "A continued financing overhang (~12 months of cash)." Analyst Anupam Rama believes the current 2016 Onivyde estimate of about $60 million (JPMorgan estimate: $57.2 million) is achievable but perhaps not meaningfully beatable. Looking ahead to 2017, the analyst believes consensus estimates will likely need to come down incrementally (consensus: $108 million; JPMorgan estimate: about $96 million). Rama cut his FY16–18 GAAP EPS estimates to ($1.19), ($0.41), and $0.08, respectively, from ($1.18), ($0.74), and ($0.26). At last check, Merrimack was down 7.32 percent at $5.54.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Oct 08, 2016 - Page 11　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp China’s property boom looks like equities bubble Bloomberg Hui Tai (許長泰) is experiencing deja vu. China’s surge in home prices reminds JPMorgan Asset Management’s chief Asia market strategist of last year’s stock-market mania. Spiraling leverage and implicit state support are among the common denominators, he said. Shanghai property values jumped 31 percent in August from a year earlier, the latest data showed. Last year, a 60 percent rally in the city’s equities through June 12 was followed by a US$5 trillion rout. Deutsche Bank Group AG warned last month that China’s housing market is in a bubble, while Goldman Sachs Group AG said this week it sees growing risks across the real-estate industry. Home prices started to take off last year in the wake of the stock-market crash after local governments eased curbs on property purchases. In recent days, cities, including Shenzhen, have started reimposing the restrictions. “It’s similar to the equity market where if you let things loose, it just runs like a stallion, and then you have to really rein it back, then it’s like an ice bucket challenge,” Hui said. “So you go through this extreme heat and cold. That’s not particularly good for the economy because then you’re going through very aggressive investment cycles.” At stake is the government’s ability to channel funds trapped by capital controls into investments that can boost the economy without creating asset bubbles. Speculative buying of commodity futures earlier this year fueled a boom that quickly unraveled, while a botched intervention to halt plummeting equities dented the credibility of policymakers and roiled global markets. Just as the surge in stocks in the first half of last year enervated financial services and provided a fillip to an ailing economy, rampant demand for property is boosting the outlook for commodities and lifting the earnings outlook for construction-related firms. Profits of industrial companies jumped the most in three years in August, while factory output, investment and retail sales also beat analysts’ estimates. Medium and long-term new loans, mostly mortgages, totaled 529 billion yuan (US$79 billion) in August, while aggregate financing jumped to 1.47 trillion yuan, helping fuel a 39 percent jump in property sales by value in the first eight months. Meanwhile, private investment in fixed assets stalled at 2.1 percent for a second straight month in August, matching a record low. Just like last year’s equity boom, China is using credit growth to boost the economy, Deutsche Bank chief China economist Zhang Zhiwei (張智威) wrote in a report on Wednesday last week. However, there are signs policymakers are acting to restrain growth in debt. The People’s Bank of China has kept its benchmark lending and deposit rates on hold for nearly a year and banks’ reserve ratios remain unchanged since February, failing to deliver the additional cuts private economists had forecast in earlier surveys. The central bank has also used longer-term tenors in the open market to drive up funding costs in a bid to rein in leverage. Still, any winding down of debt brings its own risks. “We saw the stock market tumble in 2015 from June throughout the second half, triggered by the unwinding of leverage after margin lending reached record highs,” JPMorgan Chase & Co vice chairman of Asia-Pacific Jing Ulrich (李晶) said. “Today, an alarming sign is that leverage is also building in the property market.” 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1192 times.

Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now Frisco has the Dallas Cowboys and more shopping per capita than anyplace else in Texas. What else could a town ask for? Well, how about hotels, because a lot are on the way. Three hotels are under construction in Frisco, and several more are in the works. "Frisco currently has 2,007 hotel rooms; however, based on the number of current hotels under construction, hotels that have been announced and hotels that are in the pipeline, Frisco's hotel room inventory by the end of 2018 is anticipated to explode to 4,396 hotel rooms," said Jim Gandy, head of the Frisco Economic Development Corp. "That would be an increase of 2,389 hotel rooms, or an increase of 119 percent." That's more new hotel rooms than any other area of North Texas -- even downtown Dallas. Frisco is fastest-growing city in U.S., but how close is McKinney to the top spot? With 9 million square feet of shopping, the Star in Frisco and big corporate employers next door in Plano, including Toyota, Liberty Mutual Insurance and JPMorgan Chase, Frisco hotel builders are betting that the area needs more rooms. The largest of Frisco's hotel projects has a great view of the Dallas Cowboys' The Star complex on the Dallas North Tollway. The 301-room Omni Frisco Hotel will open next summer next to The Star, the Cowboys' practice facilities and corporate headquarters. The 16-story high-rise is the tallest building so far in Frisco and includes 24,000 square feet of meeting space. Just east of the Omni on Gaylord Parkway, Missouri-based developer Drury Southwest is building a 10-story, 189-room hotel. Drury is also about to start a hotel at Richardson's huge CityLine project. "We are always looking for a great site, convenience of our customers and adjacent to market attractions," said Drury Southwest spokesman Herb Wedemeier. "Frisco definitely has that." Drury senior vice president Kevin Whitfield said the Frisco hotel is scheduled to open in June. "We are working on the sixth floor right now," he said. "It will be a mix of standard and suite rooms. "The hotel will have meeting space of about 3,500 square feet, and it will have an indoor pool on the top floor of the building." Stephen Jones on how Cowboys 'supersized' The Star and future real estate targets The third Frisco hotel under construction is a 110-unit Hotel Indigo on Gaylord Parkway. "We're across the street from the convention center and the Dr Pepper Ballpark," said Danny Patel of developer Dabu Hotels. "We are pushing to try and get it done before next summer. "Frisco provides a unique experience for guests -- both corporate and leisure," Patel said. Hotel Indigo will have suites and rooms, an outdoor pool, a restaurant, a bar and fitness facilities. Patel said construction of the nearby Dallas Cowboys complex is "icing on the cake" for the Frisco hotel market. "We are proud to be a part of that booming city." Marla Roe, executive director of the Frisco Convention and Visitors Bureau, said the timing for the hotels is good, with thousands of jobs on the way in Frisco and West Plano. "We are thrilled with the growth of hotels in Frisco, especially in light of the huge boom that is occurring in new corporations moving into the area," Roe said. "Having the ability to have a wide variety of price points and new hotels allows us to accommodate more visitors -- sports, leisure and business travel -- in Frisco, which then increases the amount of economic impact directly into the Frisco economy." Asian population growth brings new specialty retail center to Frisco Frisco draws more than 5 million visitors a year, according to the economic development corporation. Conference and group meetings add more than $70 million a year to the city's economy. Roe said construction of the Omni and plans for a 295-room Hyatt Regency at Stonebriar Centre mall will pull in more business. "Both of these projects have outstanding locations," she said. "In addition, they have meeting space that will allow us to bring not only more meetings but new meetings from groups that are loyal to the Omni and Hyatt brands." Travelers will have a lot of choices if developers make good on their plans in Frisco. Lewisville-based hotel firm NewcrestImage is planning a four-brand hotel project with 600 rooms north of the Cowboys' complex in the $1 billion Frisco Station development. The hotel complex will include a Marriott AC Hotel and Residence Inn, and a Canopy Hotel by Hilton and Hyatt Place Hotel. Construction will start on the first three hotels in January, and the groundbreaking for the Hyatt Place will happen later. Another major Frisco project, Wade Park, includes plans for a 250-room Langham Hotel and a 185-room Hotel ZaZa. Frisco’s office market heats up, thanks to Cowboys, tollway growth With so much construction on the horizon, some developers are waiting to see how the market shakes out. Developer Hall Group postponed its plans for a hotel in its 162-acre Hall Park office campus. The developer just broke ground for a 12-story office tower at Hall Park on the tollway. But developer Craig Hall said he's not ready to build a hotel there. "With so many hotels on the way in Frisco, we've decided to wait a bit," he said Construction continues on the 300-room  Omni Frisco Hotel, near Warren Parkway and west of the Tollway, in Frisco. Andy Jacobsohn/Staff Photographer Construction continues on the 189-room Drury Hotel, on the southeast corner of Gaylord Parkway and the Dallas North Tollway.

Gatti’s previous subjects include JP Morgan Chase and Silvio Berlusconi—targets more deserving of his skills. The article was rolled out in multiple languages simultaneously, like the NSA leak: “in English by NYR Daily, in Italian by Il Sole 24 Ore, in German by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, and in French on the investigative website, Mediapart,” as the footnote read. Reporting on the reaction to Gatti’s story, the New York Times reached Ferrante’s publisher, Sandra Ozzola Ferri, for comment. “If someone wants to be left alone, leave her alone,” she said. “She’s not a member of the Camorra, or Berlusconi. She’s a writer and isn’t doing anyone any harm.” Ferrante’s readers were quick to denounce Gatti’s revelation. I myself was irritated. Even the stones know that Ferrante is Ferrante, and that’s the way her readers want it. More than Ferrante herself, her readers have benefited from her choice, spared so much extradiegetic noise. We are as invested in her anonymity—and her autonomy—as she is. It is a compact: she won’t tell us, we won’t ask, and she won’t change her mind and tell us anyway. In exchange, she’ll write books and we’ll read them. The feminist defense of Ferrante’s privacy was especially swift. It’s difficult to read a man’s attempt to “out” a writer who has said she would stop writing if she were ever identified as anything but an attempt to make her stop writing. ...“I believe that, today, failing to protect writing by guaranteeing it an autonomous space, far from the demands of the media and the marketplace, is a mistake,” Ferrante told the Financial Times last year. This is an uncontroversial truth. Writers need space to work. One word for this space is room; another is freedom; another is privacy. Each writer finds this space where she can. Woolf pragmatically emphasized the material: “give her a room of her own and five hundred a year, let her speak her mind and leave out half that she now puts in, and she will write a better book one of these days.” (She needed the metaphysical, too: “I need solitude,” Woolf wrote in her diaries. “I need space. I need air. I need the empty fields around me; and my legs pounding along roads; and sleep; and animal existence.”) Kafka found his space at night: “The burning electric light, the silent house, the darkness outside, the last waking moments, they give me the right to write even if it be only the most miserable stuff. And this right I use hurriedly. That’s the person I am.” When she was young, Dorothy West asked her mother for permission to close her door so she could think, and to lock it so she could write. “ ore here.

Scott Gamm Oct 8, 2016 10:38 AM EDT Small business owners aren't prepared to withstand financial tremors, according to a new report by the JPMorgan Chase Institute, which analyzed data from 597,000 small businesses during an eight month period in 2015. The median small business could only survive for 27 days should cash stop coming into their business. Restaurants only had a 16-day cash cushion in reserve. According to Diana Farrell, CEO of the JPMorgan Chase Institute, the cash crunch makes small business owners feel vulnerable, which helps explain the recent declines in the closely-watched Small Business Optimism Index.

Now, finally, Wall Street is starting to believe. In recent weeks, analysts have issued glowing reports on the Indianapolis-based drugmaker’s late-stage pipeline, which they say is on the verge of delivering a wide array of promising drugs for ailments from arthritis to cancer. JP Morgan, BMO Capital Markets, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse have upgraded Lilly to a “buy” rating in the past month. In response, Lilly stock, which spent much of the past decade in the $40s and $50s, has climbed to near a 10-year high, hitting the low $80s. Several analysts say they expect the stock to hit the high $90s within a year. Lechleiter “Return to growth period is finally here!” wrote Dr. Tim Anderson, a drug analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., in an Oct. 3 report. “We believe Lilly is entering a long-lasting period of accelerating revenue and earnings-per-share growth, driven by a diversified late-stage pipeline,” wrote Jami Rubin, drug analyst at Goldman Sachs & Co., in a Sept. 27 report. Wall Street’s buy-in represents a triumph of sorts for Lilly executives, who have been telling investors to keep the faith, even as revenue flattened after the company lost patent exclusivity on older drugs for depression, osteoporosis and schizophrenia. Lilly also faced doubters when it announced a string of high-profile failures in experimental drugs aimed at multiple sclerosis, lupus and Alzheimer’s disease. However, the new vote of confidence from Wall Street also raises the pressure on Lilly to deliver. Now investors are expecting Lilly to execute its plan of moving drugs through the final months of clinical trials, then securing government approval and launching the products flawlessly. Lilly declined to comment about the turn of events. But in May, John C. Lechleiter, chairman and CEO, told investors at a JPMorgan Healthcare Conference that the company had the potential to launch 20 products in the 10 years between 2014 and 2023. “We believe we are in the midst of the most prolific period of new launches in our company’s 140-year history,” he said. So far this year, Lilly has launched drugs for psoriasis and lung cancer and a new injection pen for delivering insulin shots. In 2014, it launched two drugs for diabetes and one for cancer. It will release third-quarter earnings on Oct. 25, allowing investors a glimpse at how those early products are faring. Over the next three years, Lilly could launch up to six medicines for arthritis, cancer, migraine headaches and other maladies, several analysts say. Those products could generate $10 billion a year in new revenue by 2025, Goldman Sachs’ Rubin told clients in her note. Lilly’s revenue last year was $19.9 billion. “Our view is not based on any single product,” Rubin wrote. “In aggregate, we believe this product portfolio is among the more diversified and durable” in Big Pharma. Johnson Wall Street’s reaction seems to be a ringing endorsement of Lechleiter’s longtime strategy of avoiding large-scale mergers, as many other drug companies have done over the past decade. Instead, Lechleiter has placed his bets on Lilly’s own research, along with a few outside partnerships, to find enough big-selling innovations to keep the company independent. “When John Lechleiter laid out this strategy to groups around Indiana in 2008, it was seen as a bold and gutsy thing,” said David Johnson, CEO of the life sciences initiative BioCrossroads, which aims to expand the state’s life sciences sector. “There were not a lot of other companies doing this. I think Lilly is now showing it was the correct strategy.” Lechleiter will retire at the end of the year. He will be succeeded by Dave Ricks, now senior vice president, who has vowed to continue the go-it-alone strategy. “I haven’t a shred of evidence that any of those big mergers have created value for shareholders or other constituents,” Ricks told IBJ in September. “They’ve probably destroyed value. And frankly, when I speak to our largest investors, they think the same thing.” He called 2017 “a year of execution for us” to turn experimental drugs in the late-stage pipeline into valuable new products. Analysts view some of those potential products as low-risk, such as two cancer drugs called olaratumab and portrazza. A bigger wild card is an experimental drug called solanezumab for treating dementia in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Lilly is expected to release new data before the end of the year on a massive clinical trial that tested the drug on 2,100 patients. More than 47 million people suffer from Alzheimer’s disease, and it is now the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. There is no effective treatment; existing drugs only alleviate symptoms temporarily. So solanezumab could generate billions of dollars a year, if successful. However, analysts say the chances are low, because two earlier trials of the same drug failed. Lilly narrowed the focus of the latest trial to patients with mild forms of the disease. The drug acts by clearing a substance called amyloid beta from the brain before it clumps together in plaques that are a trademark of dementia. Wall Street’s doubts about solanezumab grew in March, when the company said it was changing the goal of the trial to see primarily whether the drug will slow the cognitive decline of Alzheimer’s disease in patients. Another goal, measuring patients’ dailyfunctions, was downgraded to a secondary measure of the drug’s effectiveness. Lilly’s stock dropped nearly 4 percent on the news. Baker Nevertheless, several drug analysts now say they are bullish on Lilly’s pipeline, whether or not solanezumab is shown to work. “We like Lilly without solanezumab, but like it more WITH solanezumab,” Gregg Gilbert, a drug analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities wrote in a note to clients Sept. 20. He estimated that the Alzheimer’s treatment, if successful, could generate up to $2.25 billion in annual sales for Lilly by 2020. Goldman Sachs’ Rubin sees even more potential, with annual sales peaking at $7.5 billion. Anderson of Sanford Bernstein set the drug’s odds of success at 25 percent to 50 percent, but if the clinical results are positive and the drug looks like it would get FDA approval, Lilly’s stock could double within two years. “Solanezumab could ‘transform’ the company—if it works, of course,” he wrote. With so many analysts getting excited and urging clients to buy, some local financial planners say they are seeing even small clients flocking to Lilly. “Lilly stock performed poorly for years, and I think people got fed up with it and dumped it,” said Christopher Baker, a certified financial planner and co-owner of Oaktree Financial Advisors in Carmel, whose clients include hundreds of Lilly workers and retirees. “Now, people are saying, ‘I’m going to hold onto it for a while and see what happens,”Baker said. “We’ve definitely seen a shift.”   Email Tweet ADVERTISEMENT Reporter Healthcare, life sciences, education Health Care & Life Sciences Weekly Industry e-newsletter writer Phone: (317) 472-5383 Follow John Russellon Twitter: www.twitter.com/JohnRussell99 all’s career as a journalist was set in fifth grade, when he took on an afternoon paper route for The Indianapolis News.

"Given the elections, that will obviously take a lot of the headlines in the next few weeks. … The election will put a lot of volatility in the market," said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer, equities, at Charles Schwab Investment Management. Right at the start to the week, traders will watch Sunday night's presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This second debate between the two candidates is scheduled for 9 p.m., ET, at Washington University in St. Louis and will take the form of a town meeting. show chapters <p>Here&#039;s how the market will move after the election: JPM Strategist</p> <p>JPM strategist Nadia Lovell joins CNBC&#039;s Jackie DeAngelis to discuss how market will move after the election.</p> Here's how the market will move after the election: JPM Strategist    Thursday, 6 Oct 2016 | 3:15 PM ET | 02:01 "I don't believe a Clinton win is completely priced into the markets," said Brian Muench, vice president of investment management at Allianz Investment Management. He expects a pullback in stocks by the end of the year, and polls showing a tighter race between the two candidates could contribute to the decline. The potential number of market-moving events only heats up as the week progresses. Earnings season unofficially kicks off Tuesday with Alcoa's quarterly results, and the meeting minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's September meeting are due Wednesday. New York Fed President Bill Dudley is also scheduled to speak that day. The climax comes Friday with earnings from major banks Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. "For me, the real driver for markets the end of this year should really be third-quarter earnings," said Chris Wright, ultra high net worth investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management. "We'd be looking for quite strong earnings growth in the third quarter given we've got a fairly benign third quarter." Retail sales are due for release on the same day, and Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak that afternoon on "Macroeconomic research after the crisis." "We'll be watching consumer data next week just to confirm we think the consumer is in a good position here," said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "Earnings and the retail sales and any Fed speakers will be closely watched as to how they digest (Friday's jobs) release," he said. The September nonfarm payrolls report showed creation of 156,000 for the month, below expectations, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 5 percent. Average hourly wages rose 6 cents to an annualized rate of 2.6 percent. U.S. stocks closed slightly lower Friday after the jobs report and snapped a three-week win streak. The S&P 500 ended the week at 2,153.74, weighed by a 5.3 percent decline in the REITs sector. "While we're still two jobs reports away from the Fed meeting, there probably could have been some political implications for this," said David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Global Asset Management. But the data "wasn't strong enough to crow about if you're a Democrat, and it wasn't weak enough to bad mouth if you're a Republican. It won't have a lot of effect on Fed expectations." The data reduced already low expectations for a November rate hike and added to general expectations the Fed will raise rates in December. The U.S. dollar index rose 1.1 percent for the week amid increased anticipation of a rate hike later this year and the plunge in the pound. Gold futures for December delivery fell nearly 5 percent for its worst week in three years and settled Friday at $1,251.90 an ounce. Treasury yields were lower after the jobs report, with the U.S. two-year Treasury note yield around 0.83 percent and the 10-year yield near 1.72 percent. Bond markets are closed Monday for Columbus Day. "Yields have spent the month of October moving upward [on] fears of payrolls, the Fed, the European Central Bank," said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist, Prudential Fixed Income. "One by one, the various concerns are getting aired." U.S. crude oil futures will also be in focus next week on whether oil can hold recent gains. Crude topped the psychologically key $50 level this week before ending the week at $49.81 a barrel after Baker Hughes data showed U.S. drillers added rigs in 14 of the past 15 weeks. Meanwhile, investors will keep a close eye for news on a settlement between Deutsche Bank and the U.S. Department of Justice. Traders will also watch British pound sterling after it plunged to fresh 31-year lows against the U.S. dollar. The decline came amid comments from European leaders that indicated a stricter than anticipated break between the U.K. and the European Union would come with an official trigger of Brexit.

Stumpf, fighting to keep his job amid a national political furor, will forgo more than $41 million of stock and salary as the banks board investigates how employees opened legions of bogus accounts for customers. (Photo by Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg) It’s long been common to hear about private companies that are accused of wrongdoing by officials and paying fine to settle a lawsuit — but aren’t required to admit any guilt, even when it is painfully obvious they are. In this post, educator Larry Cuban explains why “[i]mmunity from accountability is currently widespread in the private sector, but not in the public sector.” Cuban was a high school social studies teacher for 14 years, a district superintendent (seven years in Arlington, VA), and is professor emeritus of education at Stanford University, where he has taught for more than two decades. He is the author of numerous books, including “Inside the Black Box of Classroom Practice: Change without Reform in American Education.” This appeared on his blog in two parts (here and here) and he gave me permission to publish.   By Larry Cuban Wells Fargo, a bank that made more than $80 billion in revenue  and has a market value of $277 billion, was fined $185 million by federal regulators for creating 1.5 million fake credit card accounts. In the plea bargain that regulators made with bank officials, Wells Fargo admitted no responsibility for the financial misconduct. The company had fired more than 5,000 of its lowest-paid employees, but neither the senior vice president for community banking — where the fraud occurred — nor the CEO have lost their positions. CEO John Stumpf, who was named in 2013 as Morningstar’s CEO of the Year and earns about $20 million a year, did face U.S. Senate Banking Committee questions about the phony accounts last week. In testimony, he said, “I take full responsibility for all of the unethical practices in our retail banking business.” But Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), a member of the Banking Committee, said what the bank did was a “scam” and that Stumpf “should resign” and “be criminally investigated.” Looking back at the fallout from the Great Recession of 2008 in lost billions of investors’ dollars, millions of home foreclosures, and crushed hopes of a generation of hard-working American retirees — apart from one senior trader at Credit Suisse who was convicted and served 30 months — not one single CEO of an investment house, bank or insurance company hip-deep in deceiving and defrauding Americans was indicted or served a day in jail. Yes, federal regulators fined other banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America billions of dollars but they, like Wells Fargo, admitted no unlawful conduct and took no responsibility for their actions (see here, here, here, and here). Contrast that with the savings-and-loan bank failure in the 1980s when over 1,000 bankers  went to jail for fraud and similar charges. That was then, this is now. Immunity from accountability is currently widespread in the private sector, but not in the public sector. Take the case of the Atlanta Public Schools and the cheating scandal between 2009-2015. Then district superintendent Beverly Hall led the district between 1999 and 2010. In 2009, she was named Superintendent of the Year by the American Association of School Administrators. But in 2011, states officials investigated after  the Atlanta Journal-Constitution published revelations that nearly 180 teachers and officials in 44 schools raised students’ test scores, and Hall  and 31 teachers and administrators were indicted and stood trial.  Most of these educators took plea deals; Hall died of breast cancer during the trial. Eleven educators accused of tampering with students’ test scores were convicted in 2015 and are now serving from one to seven years in Georgia prisons. No immunity from accountability here. Lawyers and historians say often that before rushing to judgment, one must become familiar with the circumstances, the organizational setting and the mind-set of those who committed the crimes. So what were the contexts for Wells Fargo’s fraud and Atlanta’s cheating scandals? Wells Fargo Beginning as early as 2009, individual employees, many of whom earned less than $15 an hour, were expected to sell Wells Fargo products (e.g., credit cards, over-draft protection, checking and  savings accounts) to existing customers in order to meet their monthly goals. If they  fell short, sales representatives were written up, reprimanded or let go. Managers put intense pressure on their employees to meet these targets. Rita Murillo, a bank manager who left the company said: “We were constantly told we would end up working for McDonald’s. If we did not make the sales quotas … we had to stay for what felt like after-school detention, or report to a call session on Saturdays.” Wells Fargo quarterly profits continued to climb in the years following the Great Recession. Investors were pleased. As the years passed, word of bogus credit cards, checking and savings accounts and angry customers leaked out. The Los Angeles Times published an expose of the practices in 2013. The intense race to meet monthly goals created a culture where sales staff were pushed again and again to meet their targets or else. Phone calls from bosses were dreaded. After newspaper articles appeared, managers fired employees. Even after the Times‘ revealing of these practices and the dog-eat-dog ethos at Wells Fargo, bogus credit cards and new accounts continued.  Then state and federal regulators entered the picture. Fines were levied against Wells Fargo but not one senior executive was either admonished or forced to resign. This is the context for Wells Fargo (see here, here, and here). The Atlanta Public Schools The high-poverty, mostly black district had struggled for decades with low graduation and high dropout rates and state test scores near the bottom of Georgia’s public school systems. Within the segregated district — there are a few largely white schools and the rest are largely black — academic gaps between white and black have been large and persistent (e.g., majority white Grady High School graduates 82 percent of its students while majority black Douglass High School is 42 percent). Pressure to raise state test scores and graduation rates rose and fell as superintendents came and went in the 1990s. With the appointment of Beverly Hall in 1999 and the signing of the federal No Child Left Behind law in 2002, that pressure increased considerably. Rewards and sanctions accompanied goals of raising test scores across the district. All teachers in schools meeting 70 percent of their goal, for example, would receive bonus payments. The superintendent’s contract had a similar provision for increases to her salary. Sanctions for low test performance under NCLB led to closed schools, firing principals and reprimands for district office administrators not meeting state and federal goals under Adequate Yearly Performance. Hall was determined to improve Atlanta’s student performance, and the numbers rose over the years. Bonuses went to many schools and the superintendent. Rumors of tampering with test scores circulated and were dismissed. A number of teachers reported principals fiddling with test score results. Nothing happened except strong district office messages to be quiet or leave. A culture of fear blanketed schools. Then the Atlanta Journal Constitution investigated the rumors and published their startling report in 2009 on how much adult cheating occurred on district tests. State officials then completed their investigation in 2011 (see here). The results of that investigation led to charging the superintendent, principals and teachers in over three dozen schools with changing student test scores. The report pointed to the high-stress placed on raising test scores and the pervasive fear among school employees of retaliation if anyone reported abuses. Some quotes from the state inquiry: *“Throughout this investigation numerous teachers told us they raised concerns about cheating and other misconduct to their principal or SRT [School Reform Team] … only to end up disciplined or terminated.” *“[T] message was: ‘Get the scores up by any means necessary;’ in Dr. Hall’s words, ‘No exceptions and no excuses.’” *“In sum, a culture of fear, intimidation and retaliation permeated the APS system from the highest ranks down.” At both Wells Fargo and in the Atlanta public schools hard-driving managerial pressures created fear-strewn workplaces where success-filled data became the goal. Similar contexts in a public and private institution turned up. Yet accountability for fraud in these two institutions differed greatly. How come?   — Part 2: Wells Fargo bank and the Atlanta public schools defrauded large numbers of customers and students. At the bank, over 5,000 employees were fired. The bank’s CEO admitted responsibility for the fraud before a U.S. Senate Banking Committee yet the fine levied by federal regulators ($185 million) wasn’t even a slap on the wrist, given the $80 plus billion in revenues that the bank took in last year. Nor did the bank admit in that agreement to pay the fine any responsibility for for their actions. The CEO is still CEO. The Atlanta public schools cheating scandal found evidence of 178 principals and teachers in over 40 schools tampering with student scores on state tests. Eleven teachers were indicted, tried, and convicted (over 20 other educators took plea deals).  Those 11 are in prison. Two questions occurred to me as I read and pondered these instances of corruption Wells Fargo and the Atlanta public schools. First, why did employees scam customers with bogus bank accounts and educators tamper with test scores? The familiar answer: some bad apples caused the problem — which is basically saying it was individuals acting badly not an organizational problem. Over 5,000 fired at Wells Fargo is a lot of “bad apples, however.” Over 40 schools and 178 educators is also a lot of “bad apples.” The “bad apples” answer side-steps the pervasive culture in Wells Fargo and Atlanta public schools that top leaders shaped and drove unrelentingly. Top officials created an organizational culture of producing results at any cost. Ample evidence exists of top managers  setting very high performance goals that were difficult to meet; the company and district created fear among employees who didn’t meet those goals. Penalties for low performance and retaliation for those who complained fostered a culture of fear. Compliance to do what expected even if it disadvantaged customers was a powerful reason to keep a job. In short, the culture caused employees to peddle bogus accounts and fix test scores. But — you knew a “but” was coming —  not all of the lowest-paid employees engaged in the fraud. While cultural pressures can be strong and influential, they do not always determine individual action.  Sure, 5,300 Wells Fargo employees were fired but many more retained their jobs by figuring out ways to perform and not defraud customers. Similarly, all Atlanta  educators experienced the same intense pressure to raise students’ test scores but many principals and teachers followed the rules and did what they were supposed to do in administering and scoring tests. Yes, organizational culture surely shapes behavior but it does not determine how every individual acts. Top officials were greedy; they thought they could get away with the fraud and cheating and boost the reputation of their organizations.  Over the years, bipartisan policies deregulated industries (e.g., financial companies, airlines) creating a climate where profit seeking is highly prized. Billionaires become American heroes dispensing donations, advice, and encouragement to aspiring millionaires. The  language describing unvarnished greed has softened, euphemisms abound describing the unceasing chase for more and more money (e.g., “being entrepreneurial,” “individual enterprise”). Not only in the corporate sector, this profit-seeking culture has now spread across public institutions such as schools, hospitals, and prisons (see here, here, and here). None of this should surprise any reader since individual profit-seeking is in the DNA of a capitalist democracy. From John Jacob Astor to John D. Rockefeller to Cornelius Vanderbilt, billionaires made their money in trade and real estate, oil, and railroads. They became legends in their own time. They were admired, inspiring their fellow Americans whether they were poor, working class or just got a hand-hold in the middle class to get rich In the U.S., the job of curbing the unrelenting search for profit has been the role of government, as it has in most developed countries. We have lived in a mixed economy where both business and government have interacted constantly checking and balancing one another for nearly two centuries. When that partnership breaks down or one side becomes too powerful—too much government regulation or too much business influence on governmental policy then shifts in political power  occur to correct that imbalance. Consider the New Deal following the Great Depression  of the 1930s. Or deregulation of industries since the 1980s and reforming the tax code to benefit the wealthy. The U.S. is in such a moment now of inequalities in wealth that call for restraining the richest of the rich from re-shaping government policies to make it easier for them to become even wealthier while leaving middle class families trail far behind in increasing their salaries. Second, why are there differences in holding public and private employees accountable for their crimes? Since the late 1970s, the United States is in a moment when business success, corporate entrepreneurs, and keeping government regulation at arm’s length has dominated public policy. “Government is the problem,” as Ronald Reagan put it. Getting rid of government rules and bureaucracy, conservatives argue, will unleash business owners to invest and create more jobs for Americans. Anti-government rhetoric morphed into state and federal laws — e.g., tax cuts, incentives for investors to locate their monies in off-shore accounts and not pay taxes, low interest rates, fewer IRS audits —  that benefited those who ran companies and had large investment portfolios. Corporate leaders, backed by large sums of money, hired lobbyists to influence legislators to deregulate airlines, banks, pharmaceuticals, and other industries so that more money would flow to the already rich. To the rich, public institutions were  feeding at the tax-payer trough and were not as efficient and effective as private sector companies. Accountability was needed, business leaders said, to hold public officials in schools, hospitals, and prisons to be responsible for student outcomes, curing illnesses, and punishing criminals. And that is how I explain why no CEO of a company heavily involved in the chicanery of the Great Recession of 2008 has gotten convicted while some Atlanta school employees went to jail.           local answer-sheet Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Over the next 10 years, the Washington, D.C., suburb plans to revitalize 16 blocks in its Old Town neighborhood, unifying the waterfront with $120 million of park improvements and private-sector, mixed-use developments. Among the high-profile projects is that of Bethesda-based developer EYA, which has plans to replace two former Washington Post warehouses with a development featuring 26 townhouses, a 70-unit condo building and ground-floor retail. But many residents are opposed to the traffic, density and modern architectural styles that redevelopment will bring. The economic viability of the project is also a concern. A lack of interest from hoteliers recently scuttled developer Rooney Properties’ plans to transform the vacant Robinson Terminal North into a hotel and condo complex with 25,000 square feet of space for shops and restaurants. Maine President Barack Obama has created a new national monument in north-central Maine with 87,000 acres donated by Burt’s Bees co-founder Roxanne Quimby. The businesswoman spent two decades amassing the parcel, worth an estimated $60 million, by reinvesting the proceeds from the personal-care-product company. The wooded expanse, located to the east of Baxter State Park, offers views of Katahdin, Maine’s tallest mountain, and teems with wildlife, including moose, black bears, coyotes and bald eagles, the Associated Press reported. “Through this incredibly generous private gift for conservation, these lands will remain accessible to current and future generations of Americans, ensuring the rich history of Mainers’ hunting, fishing and recreation heritage will forever be preserved,” Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said. Legacy West Plano, Texas The prospect of walkability is drawing corporations like Toyota, FedEx, JPMorgan Chase and Liberty Mutual to Plano, a city 20 miles northeast of Dallas. Karahan Companies, the master developer of a $3 billion, 255-acre, “eat, work, play, live” community called Legacy West, is including “an open-air urban village” within its boundaries. The project, which is about 50 percent complete, will feature a 15-story hotel, a 55,000-square-foot food hall and more than 1,000 rental units and condos, as well as retail, restaurants and music venues, Urban Land Magazine reported. Public parks and trails will connect the office buildings to the 38-acre “village.” The target? Millennials who refuse to work in isolated suburban office parks. The site, owned by department store chain JCPenney, sits at the intersection of Dallas North Tollway and State Highway 121, a 20-minute drive to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. To support the project, Plano is realigning roads, improving utility connections, offering tax breaks and performing studies on mass transportation. Detroit Book Tower Developers are working to transform a run-down stretch of downtown Detroit’s Washington Boulevard into the grand passage it once was — think of it as the Motor City’s answer to thoroughfares like Fifth Avenue or the Champs-Élysées. An estimated $600 million is flowing into projects along a four-block stretch between Michigan Avenue and Grand Circus Park, funding the renovation and construction of apartment buildings, ground-floor retail, offices and housing for low-income seniors. Inspired by the successful renovation of the 33-story Westin Book Cadillac Hotel a decade ago, a handful of developers who bought buildings at rock-bottom prices during the city’s fiscal budget crisis are shelling out for painstakingly detailed historic restorations. Dan Gilbert’s Bedrock Real Estate Services plans to overhaul the 38-story Book Tower and the Book Building next door. The long-vacant skyscraper’s Italian Renaissance-style architecture, which features an aged-copper roof and “carvings of seminude female figures,” is so ornate that the budget for the three-year restoration is expected to top $400 million, Crain’s Detroit Business reported. The firm, which owns about 90 properties in the city center, bought Book Tower, Book Building and another adjoining property for an estimated $30 million. Sharon, Connecticut Celebrity couple Michael J. Fox and Tracy Pollan are trying to unload their Connecticut vacation home, trimming the asking price for the lush 72-acre estate by 12 percent, to $4.25 million, Variety reported. The property, located in the Litchfield County town of Sharon, contains a 5,000-square-foot home with six bedrooms and 4.5 baths, and features a pool and a horse barn. The retreat was custom built in 1997 for the couple, who famously fell in love on the set of the TV sitcom “Family Ties.” “It’s a fantasy, a place we go to on weekends, where everything else falls away,” Fox told Architectural Digest in 2000. At the time, the “Back to the Future” actor, who has been open about living with Parkinson’s disease, credited the architect and design team with giving him “the best therapy possible.” Marshall, Virginia A 167-acre estate that offered a brief reprieve to President John F. Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline, as they sought privacy and proximity to Washington, D.C., has been re-listed at $5.95 million, a 46 percent discount from its 2013 price. The four-bedroom home in Marshall, Virginia, was commissioned for the couple and completed in 1963, the same year that John Kennedy was assassinated. Named Wexford by Jacqueline Kennedy, after the county in Ireland where the Kennedy clan originated, President Kennedy was able to use the vacation home only two times, according to the Washington Post. The property boasts a pool, a tennis court, a stable and an underground bomb shelter. Jacqueline Kennedy sold the property in 1964 for $225,000. Detroit Professional skateboarder and entrepreneur Tony Hawk is taking his stupefying skating tricks to the Motor City. He and his wife recently snapped up a historic redbrick multifamily building in the city’s Woodbridge section. The property, which is around 120 years old, has three units measuring 1,200 square feet each. The price was not disclosed. Hawk’s family is planning to use one of the units as a pied-à-terre and to rent the remaining units. The building was originally built as a single-family mansion and at one point was used as a hospital, the Detroit Free Press reported. Hawk’s wife is from Detroit, and the couple wanted to invest in the city, said Jim Tumey, a broker who advised on the transaction. The family, he said, “wanted to put their money and their stamp on the city.” Sure enough, after the closing, Hawk posted an Instagram photo of himself skating in Woodbridge’s skate park.

Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. “I just don’t think the system is functioning the same and I think the monetary authorities are trying to figure out what these things do,” Dimon, 60, said Friday at the Institute of International Finance’s annual meeting in Washington. “Nor do I think the systems are coordinated. Fiscal policy and monetary policy -- if we got those things right I think we would have extra growth.” The U.S. central bank left its benchmark rate unchanged last month as it waits for more evidence of progress on inflation and employment, though policy makers signaled an increase is still likely by year-end. The European Central Bank also kept its rates and pace of bond purchases unchanged as it gave its technical committees a “full mandate” to propose redesigns for quantitative-easing, programs that boost the money supply through unconventional measures. “QE1 kind of worked, QE2 worked less, QE3 may not work,” Dimon said. “A little bit is pushing on a string -- no corporation is going to build a new plant because rates are low.” ‘Ineffective Cartel’ Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President Gary Cohn called the world’s central banks an “ineffective cartel” that’s causing global growth to stagnate. “We no longer have independent countries with independent central banks that can drive economic growth or contract economic growth within their own countries,” Cohn, 56, said earlier at the same conference. “We have a globalized world with a globalized work force and we therefore have a globalized monetary policy.” The International Monetary Fund this week kept its estimates for worldwide growth unchanged from July and said rising political tensions over globalization are threatening to derail a recovery. The global economy will expand 3.1 percent this year before accelerating 3.4 percent in 2017, while the U.S. economy, the world’s biggest, will grow 1.6 percent this year, down 0.6 percentage point from July’s estimate, the IMF said. Dimon and Cohn aren’t disinterested parties. Banks typically make more money when interest rates rise as the gap widens between how much they charge borrowers and pay depositors. Bank shares have climbed this year on days when speculation increases that the Fed is closer to boosting rates. Days before last month’s Fed meeting, Dimon encouraged the central bank to “just raise rates.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(NYSE: CWH) entered the market on a positive note for its initial public offering. The company priced its 11.4 million shares at $22 per share, which was the mid-point in its expected price range of $21 to $23 per share. At this price, the entire offering, including an overallotment option for an additional 1.7 million shares, is valued up to $288.2 million. The underwriters for the offering are Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Baird, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Wells Fargo and Stephens. This company is the only provider of a comprehensive portfolio of services, protection plans, products and resources for recreational vehicle (RV) enthusiasts. Roughly 9 million households in the United States own an RV, and of that installed base, Camping World has approximately 3.3 million active customers. The company generates recurring revenue by providing RV owners and enthusiasts the full spectrum of services, protection plans, products and resources that it believes are essential to operate, maintain and protect their RV and to enjoy the RV lifestyle. Camping World has 120 locations around the United States in key national RV markets. In 2015, the network generated roughly 3.5 million unique transactions, continuing to build its active customer database. The company highlighted a few key points related to its financial performance: Active Customer database had approximately 3.1 million customers on December 31, 2015, representing a 4.9% five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Total revenue was $3,333.3 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, representing a 21.3% five-year CAGR. Net income was $178.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, representing a 139.8% five-year CAGR. The company expects to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay its indebtedness, with the remainder being put toward working capital and general corporate purposes. CEO Marcus Lemonis said in a CNBC interview that the proceeds from this offering would be used to deleverage the company, which historically operates at three-times leverage. Shares of Camping World were last seen at $23.95, with a range of $23.62 to $24.35 on the day thus far. As of 10:30 a.m. Eastern, roughly 3 million shares have moved.

REUTERS/Dylan Martinez WASHINGTON Britain's vote to leave the European Union has made it more likely that the euro zone will not be around in 10 years, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) CEO Jamie Dimon told bankers on Friday. "Brexit makes the chance of the euro zone not surviving 10 years from now five times higher," Dimon said at the Institute of International Finance's 2016 annual membership meeting in Washington. Speaking at the same event, James Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley (MS.N), said that the big winner from Brexit would be New York because business currently carried out in London would shift there.

It includes Fitch's 'Exposure Draft: Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds - Effective from April 14, 2016 to July 18, 2016' and 'Rating Criteria for U.S. Commercial Mortgage Servicers', which were omitted from the original release.) Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Waldorf Astoria Boca Raton Trust 2016-BOCA (WABR 2016-BOCA) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 2016-BOCA. Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as follows: --$145,100,000 class A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$275,000,000a class X-CP 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$275,000,000a class X-NCP 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$50,500,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$37,400,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$42,000,000 class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$80,000,000 class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$75,000,000 class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable. (a) Notional amount and interest-only. The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as of June 15, 2016. The certificates represent the beneficial interest in a trust that holds a two-year, floating-rate, interest-only $430 million mortgage loan secured by the fee and leasehold interests in the 1,047-room Waldorf Astoria Boca Raton Resort & Club. The loan is sponsored by the Blackstone Group, L.P. (Blackstone). The loan was co-originated by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (rated 'A+'/'F1+'/Stable Outlook) and Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company (rated 'A'/'F1'/Stable Outlook). KEY RATING DRIVERS High Leverage on Full Debt Stack: The total debt package includes mezzanine financing in the amount of $285 million that is not included in the trust. Fitch's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value (LTV) for the full debt stack are 0.66x and 165.5%, respectively. Fitch's DSCR and LTV for the trust component of the debt are 1.10x and 99.5%. Asset Quality: Fitch assigned the Waldorf Astoria Boca Raton Resort and Club a property quality grade of A-'. The collateral has both lakefront (Lake Boca Raton) and oceanfront (Atlantic Ocean) land. Property amenities include: a full-service spa, three fitness centers, 30 tennis courts, 16 food and beverage (F&B) outlets, two 18-hole golf courses, seven swimming pools including a FlowRider wave simulator, a 32-slip marina and approximately 200,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor meeting space. Significant Capital Invested by Sponsor: The sponsor acquired the property in 2004 and has invested $274.2 million ($261,886/key) since acquisition. Completed renovations include: complete room renovations at the Cloister, the Tower, and the Bungalows; construction of the Boca Beach Club; upgrades to the Yacht Club rooms; lobby modernization; F&B outlet improvements; and updating the meeting facilities. Non-traditional Hotel Income: For the trailing 12-month (TTM) period ended April 2016, approximately $64.1 million of non-room and non-F&B revenue was generated by the property, representing 29.6% of the property's total revenues. Ancillary revenue sources include golf, spa, tennis, beach, marina and club fees. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch found that the 'AAAsf' class could withstand an approximate 72.8% decrease to the most recent actual net cash flow (NCF) prior to experiencing $1 of loss to the 'AAAsf' rated class. Fitch performed several stress scenarios in which the Fitch NCF was stressed. Fitch determined that a 63.2% reduction in Fitch's implied NCF would cause the notes to break even at a 1x debt service coverage ratio (DSCR), based on the actual debt service. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings for class A and found that a 21% decline in Fitch's implied NCF would result in a one-category downgrade, while a 47% decline would result in a downgrade to below investment grade. The Rating Sensitivity section in the presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities. Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the accompanying presale report. The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's web site 'www.fitchratings.com' or by clicking on the link. DUE DILIGENCE USAGE Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst and Young, LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on ABS Due Diligence Form-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to the mortgage loan and related mortgaged properties in the data file. Fitch considered this information in its analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

We discussed Nuveen’s overall strategy, municipal bonds and Nuveen’s new aggregate bond ETF. Kremenstein also shared his opinions on some of the challenges and opportunities of competing in such a crowded and evolving ETF market. ETFdb.com: Please tell us about yourself as well as about the career trajectory that led you to becoming Head of ETFs at Nuveen. Martin Kremenstein (M.K.): I started working in finance in London back in 1998 straight out of school, and did a variety of jobs working for Chase Manhattan JPMorgan London. I entered the ETF space in August of 2006 when I joined Deutsche Bank. At the time, Deutsche Bank had one ETF, PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC A), and were about to launch their second ETF, PowerShares DB G10 Currency Harvest Fund (DBV A-). We built out our business. Asset flows in 2009 were phenomenal; we started the year at $4.5 billion and ended the year at $13.5 billion. We became the number six ETF issuer in the U.S. by assets at that point. We realized that for the business to continue to grow and thrive, we needed to pivot away from being just a commodity provider. We polished our offerings by acquiring PowerShares (which was sold to Invesco in 2014.) Furthermore, we decided to build international equity products that would allow investors to protect against the strength of the rising dollar. I helped launch those products and the U.S. X-trackers business as CEO of that business. A little over a year ago, I decided to look at other career options and was interested in going to a buy-side solution-based institution. I joined Nuveen in October 2015. ETFdb: Nuveen has strong exposure in the municipal bond market. What is Nuveen’s overall strategy in the ETF space? M.K.: Nuveen definitely has a strong muni shop, as that’s how we made our name originally. I think it’s important to consider Nuveen in the context that it is now – a division of TIAA Global Asset Management (TGAM). TGAM is an incredibly strong fixed income shop that runs assets for the overall insurance company. Our strategy is to tap into the strengths of TGAM in a way that’s additive to the lineup. The question we should really dig into is, “Where is TGAM strong?”, rather than “Where is Nuveen strong?” ETFdb: One of the primary reasons why investors invest in municipal bond ETFs would be for tax exemptions at the state and federal levels. Other than tax, what are the additional reasons why investors should look at municipal bonds? What would be a good piece of advice that you would give investors for due diligence related to munis? M.K.: Obviously, the main reason would be for tax advantages. I think investors are looking for a stable investment; many investors equate muni bonds as safe-haven investments. I think when you are looking at munis, you need diversification in your fixed income. It’s a great way to diversify without taking on added risk. I think munis is a very specialized market and, therefore, you need to do your due diligence on the manager. This applies to ETFs and index products. You need a good manager to execute against a benchmark; execution in fixed income is a big deal, especially in the less liquid parts of fixed income. Munis can become illiquid from time to time. I think having a skilled experienced manager with strength and depth is very important. ETFdb: Last year Nuveen revealed plans on converting a couple of commodity closed-end funds into ETFs – the Nuveen Diversified Commodity Fund and Nuveen Long/Short Commodity Total Return Fund. What was the rationale for bringing these ETFs to market? Do you think every investor should have some exposure to commodities in their portfolio? M.K.: I am a proponent of commodities in your portfolio. The biggest reasons for having them in your portfolio are for their diversification benefits and to hedge against expected inflation. In terms of the products you mentioned, they were trading at steep discounts. We wanted to find a way to close the gap i.e. discount, while allowing investors to stay invested and giving them a better outcome. For investors who wanted to get out, they can redeem their shares now. This was a way to satisfy both parties – people that wanted in and that wanted out. We felt this was the best way to do it. ETFdb: You recently had a new ETF that was launched – the NuShares Enhanced Yield US Aggregate Bond ETF (NUAG n/a). What inspired the vision for this particular ETF? What is the proposed strategy, and what type of securities will the ETF hold? M.K.: It is an aggregate universe we started with; it’s the BofA Merrill Lynch Global Broad Bond Market Index. It is targeted toward the U.S. investor and denominated in U.S. dollars. We divided the aggregate universe into 38 sectors by maturity and by underlying asset class, like Treasuries, corporates, securitized debt and then, within those maturities and asset classes, by credit rating. We are breaking the link between issuance weighting and the weighting in your portfolio. Rather than weighting by issuance, we are weighting by yield and overweighting high-yielding sectors. We have a strong quantitative fixed-income team at TGAM. We used our models to isolate a risk factor, similar to factor investing, but at a fixed-income level. Historically, the majority of returns have come from yield, so why not weight by that? Which is what the NUAG ETF does; it divides the aggregate universe into buckets, and builds an optimized portfolio in which we are high yielding without taking on any extra duration. We haven’t downgraded the credit spectrum by much, and have kept our key rate risk the same. It is this risk-managed framework that allows you to boost your core fixed-income holding. ETFdb: What are some of the challenges and opportunities of competing in such a crowded ETF market? How do you see the ETF industry evolving over the next five years? M.K.: I think the biggest challenge is getting space to be sold and to be heard. There are so many active managers doing multi-factor ETFs. For us, we want to zig where others zag. We are looking for less served areas of the market. If I am the 20th multi-factor option out there, I am not really offering investors anything new. The real challenge is to find out where those under-served areas of the market lie. The markets are evolving, investors are evolving, and so we have to keep staying relevant. It is important to keep your eye on the markets, investors and their demographics, and your competitors. Another challenge is that the distribution model is changing as well, so you have to keep your eye on that. The client base is changing; the intermediaries and their clients are changing also. I also think there are more smart-beta products coming. We’ve already hit the large buckets – large-cap equity, international equity, mid-/small-cap equity and so on. Fixed income has a fairly blank slate. I think there are $7 billion of assets in smart-beta fixed-income right now. If you extrapolate out fixed-income ETFs to 2020, you can ask yourself, “What if smart beta became the same percentage of fixed income that is in equities right now at 25%?” That is a $200 billion dollar opportunity. Smart beta will also likely start to permeate other asset classes. ETFdb: Fixed-income ETFs is one of the stories of the 2016 years with almost $43 billion going into that space. Is this a case of liquidity transformation – where liquidity challenged securities are being prepackaged into liquid securities – or is this liquidity all just an illusion? M.K.: An ETF is as liquid as the least liquid constituent in the basket. You cannot magically create liquidity. I think ETFs can be a much better leading indicator of liquidity when it comes to fixed income. If you see a bond ETF trading at a discount to its NAV, it is a very likely indicator of where the bonds in the basket should be priced. The ETF wrapper, overall, is not magically going to create liquidity. ETFdb: What would be your best piece of advice for investors in this market environment? M.K.: I think you have to do your due diligence – manager due diligence as well as index due diligence. I think that managers are less important in the equity space, because many of the baskets are 100 percent replicable and much of the creation/redemption is done in kind. In the fixed-income space, I think you need to look at the pedigree and capabilities of the manager, of the overall team and of the overall setup. This is because you are negotiating baskets a little more; the underlying bond securities are traded over-the-counter and there is limited transparency as dealers act as market makers, directly negotiating buy and sell prices. The Bottom Line Nuveen’s new ETF, the NuShares Enhanced Yield US Aggregate Bond ETF (NUAG n/a), is designed to be a core fixed-income holding that looks to boost yield without adding extra duration or diminishing credit quality. Nuveen sees more smart-beta products coming into the fixed-income space, as it’s a $200 billion market ready for the taking.

Hurricane Matthew is just off the east coast of Florida near Cape Canaveral, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory on Friday, after killing at least 339 people in Haiti on its move north through the Caribbean. Data modelling firm RMS has told clients its initial estimates were a 42 percent chance of a $20 billion insurance loss and a 26 percent chance of a $30 billion loss from the hurricane, a source familiar with the research said. Ben Brookes, vice president capital markets at RMS told Reuters its guidance to clients was based on a forecast from earlier in the week. “We have continued to update our guidance as the situation changes,” Brookes said, without giving further details. An estimate from Kinetic Analysis of insured losses of $25 billion would make Matthew “the second most costly hurricane in U.S. history behind Katrina”, JPMorgan analysts said in a note late Thursday, referring to the hurricane which hit New Orleans and the surrounding coast in 2005. Kinetic could not immediately be reached for comment. Market participants expect these estimates to rise. “People are looking at this literally every minute and working overnight on it,” one trader said. The average impact to U.S. property and casualty insurers’ book value from $10-30 billion of insured losses from the hurricane would equate to around a quarter’s worth of earnings, the JPMorgan analysts added. A $20 billion insured loss would match the insured losses caused by Hurricane Sandy in the northeast of the United States in 2012, which did not make landfall. A loss of this size would lead to “material risks” for Lloyd’s of London insurers, analyst Ben Cohen at Canaccord Genuity said in a note on Friday. Cohen calculated a loss equivalent to Sandy would hit Beazley’s earnings by $104 million, Hiscox’s by 117 million pounds ($145 million) and Lancashire’s by $39 million. Beazley estimates an $80 billion storm would cause a $200 million loss, a spokesman said, without specifying losses from a smaller disaster. A Hiscox spokeswoman said it was too early to judge the impact of the hurricane. A Lancashire spokesman also said it was early days, but the firm was feeling “relatively relaxed” about its losses because it was very lightly exposed to risk in Florida compared with other states in which it offers reinsurance for wind damage. The hurricane represented a “real test” of reinsurers’ exposure, S&P Global said in a report, but it did not see a ratings impact, due to reinsurers’ strong capital buffers.
