 JPMorgan has promoted the next generation of trading talent Matt Turner Nov. 2, 2016, 8:57 AM 7,746 facebook linkedin twitter email print Carlos Hernandez, right, JPMorgan Chase's head of global banking, with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson JPMorgan has made a round of promotions in its equities business, following the appointment of new global coheads of that business. The bank announced in September that Mark Leung and Jason Sippel would become global heads of equities, replacing Tim Throsby, who moved to Barclays. In a memo sent Wednesday, Leung and Sippel announced a raft of promotions below them. They include: Fater Belbachir will be head of volatility trading globally and relocate to London from New York. He had previously headed volatility trading and structuring for the Americas. Luiz de Salvo and Dennis Fitzgerald will become heads of global cash trading and also lead the Americas region. They previously headed cash equities trading in the Americas. Chris Berthe and Charles Chiang will head global delta one, and they will develop the synthetic equity business along with the prime business. David Robertson will take responsibility for JPMorgan's international financing business. Paul Brannan and Jonathan Cossey will become heads of prime brokerage. Brannan was previously US head, and Cossey led Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. JPMorgan ranked No. 2 on Wall Street for equities revenue in the first half, according to data from Coalition, with a No. 1 position in equity derivatives. "We are positioned incredibly well and yet, we still see more opportunities for us to invest and grow," Daniel Pinto, the CEO of the corporate and investment bank, said in a memo announcing the appointment of Leung and Sippel.

Both access and design issues are preventing potential employees and employers from identifying the appropriate job fit. The report, “Swiping Right for the Job: How Tech is Changing Matching in the Workforce”, highlights the problems low and middle skilled workers and employers face in using technology, explores how tech is changing labor market interactions, and identifies the benefits, challenges and design changes required for labor market technology to have its greatest impact. “Despite an increase in technology usage, we’re seeing missed opportunity in job matching due to design flaws and access barriers,” said Chauncy Lennon, Head of Workforce Initiatives, JPMorgan Chase. “We’ve identified how to more efficiently connect people with the jobs and training they need and if we turn these lessons learned into smarter tools, we’ll create economic opportunity for everyone.” Labor market matching technology exists primarily online, and low- and middle-skill workers, who typically have wages below the median, are disproportionately likely to lack access to computers and the internet at home. Only sixty-three percent of those with a household income between $20,000 and $50,000 have access to broadband internet at home, compared to 80 percent of those with a household income between $50,000 and $75,000. While job seekers with varying degrees of education use their smart phones for job searching at approximately the same rate, job seekers who have not attended college are much more likely to go through the cumbersome process of using their smart phones to fill out an online job application and create a resume or cover letter than those who have graduated from college. Also, low- and middle-skill workers are more likely to lack proficiency in using computers and the Internet, making it difficult to navigate labor market matching technology. “JPMorgan Chase’s report underscores that too many skilled workers are being overlooked due to fixable architecture flaws in job matching technology,” said Byron Auguste, President and Co-Founder, Opportunity@Work. “When we design tools to take into account an individual’s personal affinities and background, employers will find far better candidates to place in their companies and for a longer period of time.” One example of a job matching tool design to address these issues is SkillSmart. Their platform is designed to connect job seekers, employers, and educators through mutually identified skills. The program allows employers to specify the skills needed for success in their company and helps individuals find opportunities based on their skillset. SkillSmart’s algorithm calculates how closely an applicant’s skills align with overall employer need. If job seekers do not have the necessary skills for a job they want, SkillSmart will provide suggestions for training opportunities. Additionally, SkillSmart helps educators to include in-demand skills in their curricula. Based on interviews with 45 industry leaders and an exhaustive review of research, the Swipe Right report highlights that finding the right person for the job is a crucial component of business success, employee wellbeing, worker productivity, and economic health. The consequences of getting the match wrong are high both for employees and employers. The cost of replacing a worker can be as much as 60 percent of an employee’s annual salary. Without good design, a tool will have limited usefulness and be challenging to implement. Without good implementation, a tool will not achieve its purpose of improved matching and quickly lose relevance. The report includes the following recommendations to improve the design and implementation of job matching technology: DesignBuild with User-Centered Design: Ensure that the tool is easy to use for both employers and job seekers by involving and consulting them throughout the tool design process. Use Target-Audience Language: The language used in job postings should avoid jargon and be familiar to the target job seeker. Encourage Skills-based Hiring: Work with employers to foster skills-based job descriptions and hiring practices rather than rely on increasingly irrelevant gatekeeping credentials. Engage Employers: Align with employers on occupational and skills definitions to develop a shared understanding among employers, training institutions, and job seekers. Integrate Training Opportunities and Pathways: Include easily accessible information on training opportunities to help job seekers gain skills to qualify for their desired positions. Consider Implicit Bias Mitigation: Reduce implicit bias in the hiring process by creating tools that do not expose employers to signals like names or addresses. Keep an Eye on National Trends, Use Local Data: A tool that uses local data and corresponds to the realities of the local labor market will be most helpful to current job seekers. Optimize for Mobile: An online tool should be created to reflect the ways that people use the internet, and mobile optimization is vital for job seekers who lack desktop access. ImplementationSupport Job Seeker Needs and Access: Regardless of how well a technology tool is designed, some individuals will need in-person guidance, and digital inclusion efforts may be needed to help everyone access the tool. Ongoing Activation of Industry Partners: Employers need to post their job openings through the tool and ensure that the information reflects their changing hiring needs. Recognize Need for Continued Refinement and Investment: Since online technology quickly becomes outdated, continued investment is needed to keep a technology tool up-to-date and appealing for users. Analyze Outcomes: Longitudinal data collection will help ensure that a technology tool aids employers in hiring by illuminating outcomes after the point of hire and helping determine best practices in labor market matching technology.

Launched in 2013, New Skills at Work is providing data-driven analyses, engaging employers in sector partnerships, and supporting training programs that are aligned with local demand.

Bob Michele said the world's fifth largest asset manager increased exposure to inflation-linked bonds (TIPS) and emerging market debt in the last few weeks, expecting moderate growth and solid oil prices to lift inflation and support emerging market currencies. Global financial markets were roiled by signs the U.S. presidential election race was tightening just days ahead of the Nov. 8 vote, with a possible victory for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump seen as boosting uncertainty on U.S. foreign, economic and trade policies. But Michele told Reuters in an interview that U.S. politics is not among the major risk factors the firm looks at in coming months because the House of Representatives is likely to remain Republican. "This is very important because any law that the President would like to pass has to go through the House for approval," he said. "We are in an interesting position where, if (Hillary) Clinton gets elected, the House - if it remains Republican - will likely push back a lot of things she wants to do. "But if Trump gets elected and he tries to push through a lot of the extremist, protectionist things he has talked about, I expect the House will push that back." Since both candidates are highlighting the need to rebuild U.S. infrastructure, fiscal expansion is likely, whoever wins, Michele said. In addition, U.S. and world growth look better than expected at the start of 2016 and oil prices have recovered sharply from 12-year lows hit early this year, which is likely to underpin prices in coming months. "There's a lot that will happen in a couple of weeks that will appear to be very growth friendly and very inflation-oriented, including the election," he added. "Many of the things we're doing now are to prepare in advance." JPMorgan's asset management arm has added local emerging markets debt, Michele added, citing high real yield, upsides to growth and stabilization of currencies, thanks to recovering energy prices. He named Brazil, India, Indonesia and Russia as attractive targets, adding that it was a good time to take the currency exposure as well. Michele, who manages the firm's $455-billion fixed income portfolios, also said it was looking for opportunities to sell duration. "When markets rally, we would use that as an opportunity to cut duration of our portfolios because we think the market is going through a growth and inflation scare." JPMorgan Asset Management had $1.77 trillion in assets under management by September 30.

These Wall Street Honchos Hardly Ever Use Email Money 11/1/2016 Olivia Oran / Reuters © CNBC—NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Jamie Dimon, chairman, president and CEO of JP Morgan Chase In an age when most bankers use keyboards to communicate with each other, a small group of the Wall Street elite refuses to say anything substantive in an email, text or chat, and some will not communicate digitally at all. Quotes in the article Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRK.B ▼ 157.46 -0.47 -0.30% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 79.36 -0.15 -0.19% This group, which includes top bankers like JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and powerful investors like Carl Icahn and Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s Warren Buffett, were eschewing electronic communications long before the probe of U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s emails and the recent hacks of her campaign manager’s account made headlines. Some on Wall Street are nostalgic for a time when in-person conversations or phone calls were the norm, but others believe the words they type and send can come back to haunt them. Prosecutors have built insider trading, mortgage fraud and rate-rigging cases on embarrassing emails over the past several years, and they are often the most memorable part. Recent email woes among Washington power players have provided yet another reason for bankers to try to protect private correspondence from prying eyes. Dimon uses email but is known to keep his replies short and factual, favoring “yes,” “no” and “thank you.” That behavior was evident in company emails released by a U.S. Senate committee investigating JPMorgan’s $6.2 billion “London Whale” derivatives trading loss. In one message, Dimon replied with a simple “I approve,” showing some responsibility but giving no sense of how deeply he was involved with the decision to change risk tolerances at the bank. After hearing a passing reference to regrettable emails during an interview at a conference two years ago, Dimon volunteered: “Don’t send emails after you’ve had a drink.” A JPMorgan spokesman would not comment further. Other top investors like Icahn and Buffett rely on their assistants to send and receive messages. Buffett’s assistant, Debbie Bosanek, prints out emails for the billionaire investor. Although the investors are averse to two-way digital correspondence, both blast out carefully curated messages on their Twitter accounts, with Icahn attracting 304,000 followers and Buffet, 1.2 million. Read: Forget Hillary Clinton’s Missing Emails—What About Mine? Icahn has often used the tool to promote investments or political views, while Buffett has been relatively mum, tweeting just nine times. Ariel Investments chief John W. Rogers also shuns email, which he has described to associates as a “distraction.” His staff filters important messages, prints them out and puts them on his chair for review, according to spokeswoman Merrillyn Kosier. He prefers to speak with employees in person or over the phone. “I do think there is certain cautiousness today around email,” said Virginia Healy-Tangney, a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management who focuses on managerial communication. “Since the financial crisis, executives really have to be prepared for anything they say to potentially end up on the front page of the New York Times.” Go to MSN Home More in Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY Up Next 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from Money How Three Couples Are Getting Ready for Retirement Money Upset About the Results of the Election?

Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Name * Email * Website  ×  9  =  sixty three Comment Some HTML is OK Sign me up for the Money Morning newsletter Whether or not you love Wall Street, Jamie Dimon has proven a capable CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) since he took the helm in 2006… As of 2015, Dimon has produced a 111% shareholder return since becoming CEO. And he led JPMorgan through one of the worst financial crises since the Great Depression. Part of Dimon's success is owed to his unique skillset and leadership style. Here's what we mean… 5 Things You Didn't Know About Jamie Dimon 1) Dimon accepted full responsibility for the 2012 London Whale crisis. Jamie Dimon Fact Sheet Born: March 13, 1956 (age 60); New York City, New York Pay Package: $27 million (2016) Net Worth: $1.1 billion (June 2015) Political Party: Democratic Board Member Of: Federal Reserve Bank of New York Religion: Greek Orthodox Spouse: Judith Kent Children: Julia Dimon, Laura Dimon, Kara Leigh Dimon Alma Mater: Tufts University, Harvard University Good leaders know better than to pass off the responsibility of big mistakes to their underlings — that's a mistake former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf should be able to attest to. In this case, a trader-gone-wild named Bruno Iksil (AKA the London Whale) helped run up esoteric credit default swap bets that cost the bank over $6 billion in 2012. It was a major embarrassment for Dimon, who later said the strategy was "flawed, complex, poorly reviewed, poorly executed, and poorly monitored," according to The Wall Street Journal on May 11. What's worse, the trades took place in a unit that reported directly to Dimon. Rather than craftily dismissing his oversight — or easier yet, blaming Iksil — Dimon took full responsibility. In testimony to Congress, he told Sen. Jeff Merkley that "we made a mistake. I am absolutely responsible. The buck stops with me," according to Vanity Fair in November 2012.

In March 2008, Bear Sterns, a financial firm that heavily traded mortgage-backed securities, was on the brink of failure. To prevent it from collapsing, Dimon led JPMorgan to buy the company for $29 billion. JPMorgan assumed all of Sterns' risky exposures. Later in 2008, JPMorgan did the same with Washington Mutual, saving thousands of jobs. At the time, no other institution wanted to take over these risky and dangerous financial firms. But Dimon stepped up to the plate, and in doing so, he helped save the financial industry from collapsing. As a side note, because Dimon took over the balance sheets of these troubled banks, he also had to pay a $13 billion settlement with the Department of Justice for those firms' misdeeds. Don't Miss: A Special Profit Opportunity with Only Days Left to Get the Details 3) Dimon steered JPMorgan Chase away from peddling mortgage-backed securities (MBS) before the 2008 financial crisis.  While most other big banks like Bear Sterns, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs were making risky MBS trades, JPMorgan was not. In fact, it was one of the few investment banks that largely discouraged the practice before the financial crisis, which is how it was able to absorb troubled firms during the crux of the debacle. Dimon was undoubtedly the major hand behind restricting his traders from being tempted by MBS trades. In 2006, he was credited for ordering his bank's chief of securitized products to deleverage more than $12 billion worth of subprime mortgages. 4) Despite having a net worth over $1.1 billion, Dimon is not an "extravagant man." According to those who work closely with Dimon, he doesn't live like a typical big bank CEO, Vanity Fair reported in November 2015. Heidi Miller, once listed by America Banker as one of the most powerful women in banking, worked for Dimon for 18 years. In an interview with Vanity Fair, she recounted: "I swear, if his wife didn't point out shirts that match his suits, I'm not sure what he would look like in the morning, half the time. I always think of him as somewhat rumpled. He is oblivious to the trappings of very fancy things." Dimon is not a member of the ritzy Augusta National Golf Club, unlike his two predecessors at JPMorgan Chase. In fact, he doesn't even play golf, Vanity Fair reports. During his five years living in Chicago from 2000 to 2005, when he was the CEO of Bank One Corporation, Dimon didn't attend a single black-tie charity event, despite expectations that he should as a corporate leader, according to Vanity Fair. And in 2004, after the merger of Bank One and JPMorgan Chase, Dimon spent his two-week vacation at a weekend house in Bedford, New York. He was alone, making his own coffee and perusing around the local Target in his wrangler jeans, Vanity Fair reported. Continue reading to see our No. 5 fact about Dimon that you might not expect. This quality of Dimon's is one of the reasons JPMorgan was so prepared going into the 2008 Financial Crisis, relative to other big banks. 5) Dimon runs JPMorgan with a conservative business approach.

And even they are converging into one category: companies that have been hacked and will be hacked again.” So many companies have since been hacked that it’s hard to compile a comprehensive list.

(Investor's Business Daily) Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) lost 1.2 percent of value over the last five trading days. The Vetr crowd seems to believe this has unlocked some room for upside, as evidenced by its average price target of $71.81, which implies a potential return of almost 5 percent from current valuations. Related Link: Here's How Crowdsourced Ratings Can Beat The Market Seeking to better reflect the aforementioned upside potential, the Vetr community upgraded its rating on shares of JPMorgan Chase on Tuesday, from 3.0 Stars (Hold) to 3.5 Stars (Buy) – out of a possible 5 Stars rating. It should be noted that, in accordance with the current score and price target, 53 percent of the crowd’s ratings are bullish right now.

But somewhat unlike the FBI, the central bank is not in the business of tossing live bombs into the final week of a presidential election. Pantheon’s Ian Shepherdson: “The Fed won't raise rates today, or substantively change the wording of the post-meeting statement. … “[I]f, as we expect, the committee is looking for reasons not to hike just six days before the election, they will be able to point to the one-tenth increase in September unemployment and the uncertain reliability … of the better-looking third quarter GDP data. We anticipate three hawkish dissents again, but the Committee is setting itself up to hike in December” Story Continued Below HFE’s Jim O’Sullivan: “We see virtually no chance of a rate hike this week, particularly given the proximity to next week’s election. As a result, the focus will be entirely on any hints in the statement about what might happen at the next meeting, on December 13-14. We don’t expect anything very market-moving.” MOODY’S MODEL PICKS CLINTON — Reuters: “Low gas prices and President Barack Obama's high approval ratings are key factors that favor Democrat Hillary Clinton winning the White House in next week's election, according to a model from Moody's Analytics that has accurately predicted the last nine U.S. presidential contests. Clinton is forecast to pick up 332 Electoral College votes against 206 for Republican Donald Trump, Moody's Analytics predicted … That would match Obama's margin … in 2012. “The Reuters-Ipsos States of the Nation project also predicts a Clinton win, with a 95 percent probability of her winning at least 278 electoral votes. A candidate needs to win at least 270 electoral votes to be elected president. The Moody's Analytics model is based on a combination of state-level economic conditions and political history, and has correctly called the outcome of each presidential election since Republican Ronald Reagan unseated Democrat Jimmy Carter in 1980.” Read more. LONDON BANKERS SAY CITY WILL RETAIN TITLE — In a poll out Wednesday from Synechron and the TABB Group: “72 percent of British bankers believe London will still be the financial centre of Europe in five years’ time … 55 percent of British banks have set up ‘Brexit Steering Committees’ to prepare for life outside the European Union … 56 percent of senior British capital markets executives believe that compliance costs will increase following Britain’s decision to leave the European Union … 78 percent of executives agree that Brexit will have a negative impact on UK financial markets” ALTMAN ON HRC AND TAX REFORM — Via Yahoo Finance: “Investment banker Roger Altman, a key Clinton adviser, explained Clinton’s view on corporate tax reform during a live Yahoo Finance panel discussion on the two presidential candidates’ economic policies. ‘We need corporate tax reform,” he said. ‘The campaign isn’t the place to negotiate the rate. Let’s wait until the election is over. At some appropriate point, she’s going to make a proposal.’ “In other words: It’s coming. It’s just not something Clinton wants to discuss during the campaign, when any plan to cut business taxes could be taken as a sop to corporate interests.” Read more. MAYBE 2016 DOESN’T EVEN MATTER — KBRA’s Christopher Whalen: “[W]e expect most of the major trends in terms of the global economy, interest rates, and currencies to be largely unaffected by the outcome of the U.S. poll. Simply stated, what happens within the U.S. political system has less and less impact on the rest of the world. “Americans like to flatter themselves that events inside our increasingly raucous political economy are somehow more important than developments in other parts of the world … Regardless of who occupies the White House, we believe that this tendency towards greater volatility and unpredictability in global markets will remain a central theme in the years ahead. The slow motion disintegration of the EU illustrates this danger” TRUMP RISE RATTLES MARKETS — Reuters: “Asian shares tumbled to seven-week lows and the dollar was on the defensive on Wednesday as investors were rattled by signs the U.S. presidential election race was tightening just days out to the Nov. 8 vote. Markets were beginning to rethink their long-held bets of a victory for … Hillary Clinton amid signs … Donald Trump could be closing the gap, forcing money out of riskier assets and into safe-havens such as the Japanese yen and gold. “Heavy selling also knocked the Mexican peso, seen as the most vulnerable to a Trump presidency due to his pledge to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico to prevent entry of illegal immigrants. The peso, which posted its biggest fall in two months on Tuesday, extended losses to 19.308 to the dollar, its lowest level since early October.” Read more. FEAR GAUGE BACK TO BREXIT LEVELS — FT’s Nicole Bullock, Adam Samson and Courtney Weaver: “The Vix index, a measure of expected US stock market volatility known as Wall Street’s ‘fear gauge’, neared highs last seen in the aftermath of the UK’s vote to leave the EU this summer. Gold, seen as the ultimate haven investment, rose to its highest level since early October … “‘With the Brexit trading experience in recent memory, it seems that some traders don’t want to be caught off side again and have started to act,’ said Colin Cieszynski, chief market strategist at CMC Markets. Investors see Mrs Clinton as heralding less uncertainty for markets partly because her long political career means her policies are seen as more predictable.” Read more.

GLASS-STEAGALL THOUGHTS — Capital Alpha’s Ian Katz: “The emails released by Wikileaks support our thinking that Clinton won’t always be aligned with the bank-vilifying wing of the Democratic Party. … Clinton will likely govern from the center more than most expect. The emails confirm that Clinton’s advisers don’t believe that banks are the chief culprits for the financial crisis. As a result, she would initially resist calls to break up the large firms. “Having said that, the emails also show that the Clinton crew is profoundly pragmatic. We think that if it ever got to the point where there was enough public and congressional support to revive Glass-Steagall, Clinton wouldn’t put up a big fight. The main concern in the emails is how Clinton’s opposition to a new Glass-Steagall would be portrayed to the public and specifically in a Democratic primary debate” ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: Now delivering: Retirement security for life!

Here are two well-to-do New Yorkers who add hours of travel to their schedules, and thousands of dollars to their campaign expenses, in order to avoid sleeping in the Middle America they promise they are running to represent. “ … [F]or Trump, near-nightly returns to Manhattan — from as far west as Reno, Nevada — mean a chance to sleep in his marble-and-gold hued 66th floor penthouse in Trump Tower.For Clinton, the hops to Chappaqua allow her to spread out in her colonial five-bedroom home, complete with 1.1 acres of land and a swimming pool.” Read more. TRUMP’S RIO WOES — Reuters’ Anthony Boadle and Stephen Eisenhammer: “A Brazilian prosecutor has opened a criminal investigation into investments made by two state pension funds in a luxury Rio de Janeiro hotel that is part of the Trump franchise, according to a court filing reviewed by Reuters on Tuesday. “The 130 million reais ($40 million) investment by the two small funds in the hotel's developer ‘required investigation’ due to its size, structure and high level of risk, Anselmo Lopes, a federal prosecutor in Brasilia, said in the document dated Oct. 21 that opened the inquiry.” Read more. FCC CONCERNS OVER AT&T-TIME WARNER DEAL — WSJ’s Shalini Ramachandran, Ryan Knutson and John D. McKinnon: “AT&T Inc.’s practice of exempting its streaming video services from data-usage caps is rankling competitors and shaping up as a major issue for regulators set to weigh the telecom giant’s proposed $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc. “When AT&T rolls out its $35-a-month DirecTV Now online TV service this month, its wireless subscribers will be able to stream as much as they want without it counting toward their monthly data caps. But if the same customers binge on outside services like Netflix or Hulu, those bits will add up — potentially leading to surcharges.” Read more. CHINA-MALAYSIA SIGNS TRADE DEALS — FT’s Charles Clover: “China and Malaysia signed several trade and investment deals on Tuesday as China denied that it was trying to buy better ties with its southern neighbor. “The agreements signed on Tuesday with China will further invigorate the Beijing- Kuala Lumpur alignment and strain ties with the US. Most significantly, the two nations agreed to a wide ranging naval co-operation deal in which they will jointly develop coastal patrol vessels.” Read more. FREDDIE MAC PAYS OUT — POLITICO Pro’s Lorraine Woellert: “Freddie Mac will send a $2.3 billion dividend payment to taxpayers after profits more than doubled from three months earlier. “That's what the mortgage-finance company earned in the third quarter, buoyed by strong home-price growth and market reaction to Brexit. The $2.3 billion profit was up from $993 million in the second quarter and a dramatic reversal of a $475 million loss a year ago.” Read more. HULU BUNDLES UP FOR 2017 — The Atlantic’s David Sims: “Though “cord-cutting” is on the rise and subscription numbers have declined, the change has been gradual enough to not cut too deeply into profit margins. That may change in 2017, however, with the news that Hulu will offer more than 35 live TV networks to subscribers in the New Year for an as-yet undetermined price. With this kind of “bundling,” where various popular channels are sold as a package, streaming TV is starting to more closely resemble the very thing it was meant to replace.” Read more. GAS BREACH DRIVES UP PRICES — Washington Post’s Steven Mufson: “For the second time in less than two months, a major breach closed down a key gasoline pipeline, driving up fuel prices and demonstrating the vulnerability of the entire Eastern Seaboard to an accident on a single piece of infrastructure. “Gasoline prices before taxes and fees soared Tuesday more than at any time since 2008. Early in the day, prices jumped 15 percent but finished the day up 4.6 percent at $1.4841 a gallon after the company said it hoped to reopen the pipeline Saturday afternoon.” Read more. KOREA NAMES NEW PM AND FINANCIAL MINISTER — Bloomberg’s Kanga Kong: “South Korean President Park Geun-hye named a new prime minister and finance minister Wednesday as she seeks to stem the fallout from an influence-peddling scandal threatening her grip on power. “Park nominated Kim Byong-joon, a policy adviser under the administration of former President Roh Moo-hyun, as prime minister to take over from Hwang Kyo-ahn. Yim Jong-yong, chairman of the nation’s Financial Services Commission, will take over from Yoo Il-ho in the top finance role.” Read more. IRAQI FORCES ENTER MOSUL — AP’s Qassim Abdul-Zahra and Brian Rohan: “Iraq's special forces fought their way into the outskirts of Mosul on Tuesday, taking its state television building despite resistance by Islamic State group fighters that is only likely to stiffen when combat reaches the inner city. “It was the first time Iraqi troops have set foot in the city, Iraq's second-largest, in more than two years. The advance was the start of what is likely to be a grueling and slow operation for the forces as they fend off booby traps and ambushes in difficult, house-to-house fighting expected to take weeks, if not months.” Read more. GANNETT DUMPS TRONC — NYT’s Leslie Picker and Sydney Ember: “For a deal that took six months of battling back and forth, the message of its collapse was cursory. In a brief telephone conversation early Tuesday morning, Robert J. Dickey, the chief executive of the Gannett Company, told his counterpart at the company formerly known as Tribune Publishing that Gannett, the nation’s largest chain of newspapers, was dropping its $680 million-plus takeover bid — weeks after a price had been agreed upon. “A deal would have merged the publisher of USA Today with the owner of The Los Angeles Times and The Chicago Tribune. It was intended to build a scale large enough to cut costs and eke out profits in an industry struggling with shrinking advertising revenue and declining circulations. Over the six months when the two companies sparred over a deal, the advertising market for newspapers was deteriorating. Last week, the banks that would have financed a purchase balked” Read more. NEW REGS HITTING PROFITS … AND SAFETY? — Via TCH: “[N]ew research … finds that changes in regulation are reducing banks’ profitability and therefore the market value of their equity.

However … lower profitability and market value reduce bank resilience” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: As traditional pensions have disappeared, American workers have become more responsible for saving and preparing for their retirements.

Broomfield is the smallest county in the state, the newest county in the country and the ninth-fastest growing county in the United States. Ahrens has spent most of his life in the area. "I'm literally a home-grown mayor. So it's pretty serendipitous that I'm here at such an exciting time," Ahrens said. The county had several large businesses show interest in the past three months, including JPMorgan Chase, IKEA, and the plumbing and HVAC manufacturer Viega. JPMorgan Chase bought 106 acres of land on West 160th Avenue near Sheridan Parkway with the intention of building a $200 million data and storage facility. A few miles away at Interstate 25 and Highway 7, IKEA has plans for a large plot of land. It's located next to the gas station where Crystal Haislip works. Haislip has lived her entire life nearby and isn't thrilled about more growth. "It's not the small area that it used to be. It used to be fields. You used to be able to see the mountains and now you can't," Haislip said. "It's just going to keep going. It's not going to stop. There's nothing we can do." Ahrens agrees. "We could probably have the same conversation in six months and we'll have some new projects coming," Ahrens said. He also said the reason growth comes so easy is because there are no rule differences between the city and county of Broomfield. There's only one governing body for both. So not only do businesses only have to worry about one set of rules, the county can also combine services like the police department and the sheriff's office.

Less than a month after the IPO, Wall Street finally tells you what it thinks about this stock. Rich Smith (TMFDitty) Nov 1, 2016 at 12:23PM Today we're going to tell you about a stock -- one that you may not have heard of before, but one that a few analysts think you should like. Camping World Holdings (NYSE:CWH) is the stock's name, and recreational vehicles (RVs) are its game. This morning, no fewer than six Wall Street analysts announced new ratings for Camping World Holdings, splitting their ratings down the middle with three buy ratings and three holds. R.W. Baird, KeyBanc, and Credit Suisse all hail from the buy camp, while Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs counsel holding the stock for now. And here's something that may surprise you: Each and every one of these bankers also helped to run Camping World Holdings' IPO last month! Now, wouldn't you like to know what they really think about the stock? Then you're in luck. Read on, and find out. Camping World loves the RV lifestyle -- but does Wall Street still love the stock? Image source: Camping World IPO prospectus. Let loose the bulls We'll let the bulls go first in this debate. Underwriting more than 688,000 Camping World shares, Credit Suisse tied as the stock's third-largest backer during last month's IPO. It's not too surprising, therefore, that Credit Suisse really likes this stock. Quoted on StreetInsider.com this morning, Credit Suisse rates Camping World stock an "outperform," and argues the company operates in a "fragmented industry," and offers "potential upside from higher EPS and multiple expansion." A seller of new and used RVs, Camping World also does good business selling insurance and other services to RV owners, a business model that Credit Suisse likes for its "recurring revenue model." With its "low valuation" of just $412 million in market capitalization, and trailing net profits of $190 million, Credit Suisse sees Camping World as "one of the most attractive stories in the consumer space." The analyst predicts Camping World, currently priced at $22 and change, will hit $28 within a year. For their parts, KeyBanc and R.W. Baird played lesser roles in the IPO -- but they're no less enthusiastic about the stock. According to data from ratings monitor TheFly.com, KeyBanc rates Camping World overweight with a $28 price target, while Baird says the stock will "outperform" and head to $27 a share. Having second thoughts What may interest investors even more than Camping World's enthusiasts, though, is the names of some of the analysts who once actively pushed investors to buy the stock, but whose own enthusiasm has now cooled. Chief among these are Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. Each banker underwrote nearly 4.1 million shares of Camping World stock, and so presumably liked the stock four weeks ago. But both of these bankers now rate the stock no better than neutral. Up only pennies from its Oct. 7 IPO price of $22, Goldman says that Camping World stock is worth at best $24 today. TheFly quotes Goldman warning investors that "decelerating" RV shipments industrywide "will likely weigh on the stock's multiple." JPMorgan gives Camping World only slightly more credit, assigning a $25 price target to Camping World stock. Similarly, Wells Fargo rates the stock a "market perform," and says the stock is fairly valued anywhere in the range from $23 to $25 a share -- the lower price being only pennies more than what Camping World costs today, and just $1 above the price at which Wells was pushing the stock at its IPO! A Foolish view With Wall Street walking back its enthusiasm so soon after the IPO, investors may feel somewhat less than certain about Camping World's prospects today. So what's an investor to do -- panic and sell, or stick with the stock? Here's how I look at the situation. Currently, Camping World stock sells for a P/E ratio of just 2.2. That may sound absurdly low, and imply that Camping World's recent profits are a fluke. In fact, though, Camping World's earnings don't look like a huge aberration to me. The company earned $190 million in net profits over the past 12 months, true. But it earned not much less ($178 million) in 2015 as a whole, and $125 million the year before that. Even valuing the stock on its earnings from two years ago, therefore, I can't call Camping World obviously overvalued at a mere 3.3 times 2014 earnings. Meanwhile, analysts who have published estimates for the stock on S&P Global Market Intelligence agree Camping World is likely to grow its earnings at a modest 8% pace annually over the next five years. That doesn't seem like a lot to pay for a stock selling for 2.2 times earnings -- or even 3.3. Granted, Camping World stock carries a heaping helping of debt -- $1.3 billion net of cash. Granted too, its cash flow statement is not without blemishes. (Free cash flow for the past 12 months, for example, amounts to only $97.5 million -- barely half of reported net income.) Weighing all these factors into consideration, there is reason for caution about the stock. But even so, I don't see any need to panic and sell just yet.

Thanks for reading and your comments. See you all again tomorrow morning from 9. 4:40pm on 1 Nov 2016 Shares were knocked early and then struggled to pick themselves up off the canvas, while the Aussie dollar climbed a little following the RBA decision to keep rates on hold. The ASX 200 index dropped 27 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 5291, extending October's dismal performance into the new month. The Aussie added 0.3 of a US cent to 76.5 US cents after the central bank held rates at 1.5 per cent, but seemed to add a little more positivity into its economic outlook in the accompanying statement. The big banks all dragged, with ANZ off 1.1 per cent, CBA off 0.9 per cent and NAB 0.4 per cent, while Westpac was flat. A 1.2 per cent drop in Telstra and a 1.1 per cent fall in Wesfarmers also weighed on the index. Miners were down as a group, but South32 climbed 2.3 per cent and Newcrest added 0.8 per cent. The day's worst was a 9.9 per cent fall in Orocobre, which reversed some of yesterday's big gains. There was contrasting fortunes in TV stocks: Nine added 4.1 per cent to be the day's biggest gain, but Seven dropped 4.8 per cent.  Winners and losers in the ASX 200 today. Photo: Bloomberg 4:21pm on 1 Nov 2016 In celebration of rates remaining steady at 1.5 per cent, here's the top 10 yielding stocks in the ASX 100. The top 100 averages a net dividend yield of 3.9 per cent, which isn't too shabby. More than half yield above 4 per cent. Being a high-yielding name is a bit of a black mark at the moment, as the enthusiasm for "yield plays" looks to have stalled in the face of rising bond rates and talk of gathering inflationary pressures. That's probably why the market overall underperformed in October - people selling the ASX dividend play. Still, some of the yields on offer are pretty impressive and it makes you wonder how much longer investors can continue to ignore them.  Among the big four banks, NAB yields 7.1 per cent, ANZ yields 6.3 per cent, Westpac 6.2 per cent, and CBA 5.7 per cent. The market is obviously worried that the payouts aren't sustainable.  The lowest yielding names are CYBG (zero), followed by Newcrest (0.4 per cent) and South32, which yields 0.5 per cent but which has so much cash on its balance sheet that it has to return some of it to shareholders one day, right? 3:57pm on 1 Nov 2016 The strong manufacturing PMI numbers has strengthened ANZ's belief in a change in China's growth momentum. The current PMI value has now exceeded the average value of 50.4 between January 2013 and September 2016 and represents the highest level since July 2014, the economists say. "Thus, we believe that today's data signals the end of persistent sluggishness in the industrial sector." The return of producer price inflation is starting to propel a change in policy momentum, they add. "Given the property frenzy, we see little room for the People's Bank of China to ease. But the central bank will still mitigate the risk of any cash crunch in in the money market." ANZ's base case is for the PBoC to maintain the 7-day repo rate at 2.25 per cent but the market will maintain a tightening bias, given potential concerns about deleveraging. 3:52pm on 1 Nov 2016 Three giant investors, BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, now hold the "balance of power" in corporate governance disputes. No longer the silent giants in the background, boards are now dealing with competing agendas from short termism of active managers and the long-term view of passive managers. The underperformance of the majority of Australian active managers over the past few years ,coupled with the low cost of passive funds, has driven investors into products such as exchange-traded funds en masse, with total funds under management topping $23 billion this year. The three biggest providers of passive funds are having a growing presence on company registers. According to Morningstar research, BlackRock holds 5 per cent or more of 43 companies on the ASX, including Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, CSL, Rio Tinto, Suncorp and Transurban. State Street Global Advisors holds 5 per cent or more of nine companies, mostly REITs, while Vanguard sits on 32 companies including Tabcorp, Aristocrat Leisure and Mirvac. The three majors have become a "balance of power" in the matters of corporate governance, including corporate transactions, mergers, schemes of arrangement and voting, proxy advisory firm Ownership Matters co-founder Dean Paatsch said. The trend is most prominent in the REIT sector, with passive funds making up to 20 per cent of total holdings. While these behemoths are perceived to have little reason to intervene in company decision making, the very fact that these funds cannot sell their holdings means they must develop productive relationships with company boards, BlackRock head of Asia Pacific corporate governance and responsible investment Pru Bennett said. "We can find ourselves invested in companies we have concerns about from an ESG [environmental, social and governance] perspective," she said. "An active manager can sell if they've got concerns. We can't sell, so we're locked in. We take a long-term view, and develop constructive relationships," she said. Read more. BlackRock's Pru Bennett says the fund takes a hands-on role in corporate governance matters. Photo: Sasha Woolley Back to top 3:14pm on 1 Nov 2016 Banks have quietly taken the knife to term deposit interest rates that three months were trumpeted by the industry as a sign it was balancing the needs of savers with borrowers. When the major banks only passed on about half of the Reserve Bank's August rate cut to home loan customers, they also took the unusual step of raising some term deposits rates by as much as 0.85 percentage points. Now, however, many of these deals have been quietly reduced, especially among the most popular terms of up to one year. A swag of banks including Westpac, NAB and ANZ reduced some of their term deposit rates during October, figures from Mozo showed. The wave of cuts comes after the Commonwealth Bank slashed some of its term deposit rates in September by up to 0.65 percentage points. Here's more The cuts to savings  3:11pm on 1 Nov 2016 Here's AFR Chanticleer columnist Tony Boyd on AMP's recent travails: Fund managers say it is the stock that the market loves to hate but the recent battering given to financial services group AMP has piqued the interest of deep value investors. AMP is now trading at a 20 per cent discount to the sum of the parts valuations of several leading broking analysts. One analyst, Daniel Toohey at Morgan Stanley, says the sum of the parts value is $5.71 compared to Tuesday morning's price of $4.51. Also, investors are being paid handsomely to hold the stock. At the current price the stock has a yield of 6.2 per cent and grossed up yield after franking of about 8 per cent. Since Friday's shocking $1.3 billion write-downs in its life insurance business AMP shares are down 12 per cent. The stock is down 22 per cent from its high this year of $5.80 hit on August 8. There are many reasons why the company is struggling to get strong buying support in the market at current levels. First, the company has been a disappointment over the past six years. For example, its price to book, which averaged about 5.5 between 2003 and 2007, has been about 2.2 since 2010. The takeover of the Australian arm of AXA Asia Pacific never delivered what was promised. The synergy benefits were drawn out over too many years. Another reason is that the market now expects earnings to track sideways for several years. Earnings per share are not expected to be higher than the 2015 result until 2019. AMP's core business of wealth management is suffering from the Australia-wide trend toward independent financial advice. For example, the Tynan Mackenzie financial planning business has lost about $5 billion in funds under management since become part of the AMP group. Another reason why AMP's shares are struggling to get support at levels that prevailed in 2009, is that it is virtually impossible to see a catalyst for boosting the share price in the short or medium term. One possible trigger for a re-rating would be takeover activity. But the big four banks would be forbidden from bidding for the company on competition grounds. Read more ($). It's hard to see what will push AMP shares much higher from here. Photo: Ken Irwin 3:01pm on 1 Nov 2016 Here are a few economist reactions to the RBA's decision (we'll surely get more once the dust from the big race has settled): Rahul Bajoria, Barclays: The most notable change in the policy statement was its guidance that the RBA's forecasts for growth and inflation remain largely unchanged from the August statement on monetary policy, with growth in next year forecast be close to potential, before strengthening gradually. We believe today's statement is slightly neutral relative to previous statements, although the guidance paragraph was again left unchanged. We believe the RBA will maintain a data-dependent stance on policy rates, but the urgency to reduce rates is not present as of now.  Josh Williamson, Citi: We still expect the RBA to deliver more policy easing to support aggregate demand and inflation returning to trend and to the target band respectively. The next opportunity could be May 2017 when the Q1 2017 CPI will need to show that underlying inflation is picking up from 1.5 per cent otherwise the RBA will need to revise its forecasts and provide more stimulus.  Sally Auld, JPMorgan: There are a number of reasons for the central bank to prefer a period of inactivity; first, it gives the RBA time to observe trends in the housing market. Second, the RBA will be keen to observe the path of commodity prices, especially to assess whether the recent rise in both coal and iron ore prices is transitory or otherwise. Third, the end of the decline in mining investment is now in the forecast horizon, meaning that the RBA might have a little more confidence in medium term growth outcomes. Finally, labour market data also warrant further scrutiny. Hours worked were weak in the 2Q national accounts, and the quality vs. quantity issues in job creation appear to have intensified in recent months. Paul Bloxham, HSBC: It's clear that although inflation is still below target the RBA is making use of the 'flexible' and 'medium-term' nature of the inflation targeting regime. In short, the RBA decision-makers are not 'inflation nutters'. Today they backed this up with (lack of) action. Overall, the statement was little changed from last month. Somewhat surprisingly, there was no specific reference to the recent sharp rise in coal prices. We expect the RBA to be on hold at 1.50 per cent in coming quarters. Paul Dales, Capital Economics: The decision by the Reserve Bank to leave interest rates at 1.5 per cent today may fuel some speculation that the next move in rates will be up, although not for a long time. That possibility shouldn't be ignored, but we're not convinced that the low inflation problem has been solved yet. If underlying inflation fails to rise as fast as the RBA hopes in the second half of next year, then the Bank may yet cut rates to 1.0 per cent. Craig James, CommSec: Rates may have bottomed but that doesn't mean they are likely to rise within the next year. So that means investors have to continue doing their research to find the best investment returns. The Reserve Bank will closely assess data on wages and inflation expectations in determining the next move on interest rates – either up or down. If inflation expectations fall too far – suggesting that inflation could stay below the 2 per cent for an extended period – then the Reserve Bank could cut rates again.  If wages start lifting then the Reserve Bank will start thinking about increasing interest rates. Tom Kennedy, JPMorgan: In terms of the statement, I think a lot of it was quite similar to the past few months. In terms of notable changes, I'd say there was an unusual step in that they explicitly referenced to the upcoming statement of monetary policy on Friday. They kind of said growth and inflation are going to be unchanged in terms of their forecast. That's kind of interesting. Another thing I'd probably highlight is that the language of late has softened a little bit. Very slight change, but they obviously make these changes for a reason. Given that we think this cycle is all about inflation, I'd say this statement in neutral. Brendan Rynne, KPMG: The RBA was right to keep rates unchanged. With the US election outcome still unclear next week, the prospect of a shock to the global markets cannot be ruled out. Australia must maintain some headroom in its official cash rate in case we were to get hit with an international downturn. By not having our cash rate at, or near, the 0% lower bound we have the capacity to drop rates in order to minimise any shock to our domestic economy. There is a lot of noise in recent economic statistics, including last week's higher-than-expected consumer price inflation figures, which means there is no clarity in which way the RBA should jump. Michael Blythe, CBA: We were expecting to see a cut, so an element of surprise there, though we didn't have those cut views with really strong convictions. It does look like the RBA has become a little bit more concerned about the housing market, whether it's cooling or not, so that kind of financial stability issue is a little bit more prominent for them we think. There doesn't seem to be a particular bias there, but what they have said is their inflation forecasts are basically unchanged. That means they are looking at more than two years of sub-2 per cent inflation. Su-Lin Ong, RBC: The statement was a little more upbeat. On the global front, the discussion around China's growth in infrastructure and property construction was more upbeat and the discussion around (Australian) growth in residential construction and the idea that the economy is forecast to grow close to potential is also much more positive. It's a more hawkish tone than the market had been anticipating. There is not much of a bias at all. There is a very mild easing tone. We see rates on hold and we still have a cut in the second quarter of 2017. Photo: CBA 2:46pm on 1 Nov 2016 The RBA's decision to keep rates steady has knocked on the head any hopes of a sharemarket recovery today, while the Aussie dollar has climbed 0.3 per cent of a US cent to 76.5 US cents. The ASX 200 is now 38 points, or 0.7 per cent, lower at 5281, losing a modest 10 points post the announcement. The 10-year Aussie government bond yield lifted a touch to 2.365 per cent. 2:44pm on 1 Nov 2016 Some reactions on Twitter to the RBA's hold decision: No easing bias inserted; slightly hawkish if anything: inflation expected to pick up gradually, not remain low for extended period #ausbiz https://t.co/yK4UqO1ute— Carson Scott (@CarsonScott) November 1, 2016 RBA's easing cycle over for time being---fixed-rate govt bonds selling off (yields rising) after getting hammered in Oct @FinancialReview— christopher joye (@cjoye) November 1, 2016 ...RBA once again laments the Aussie Dollar's height.

The global economy is continuing to grow, at a lower than average pace. Labour market conditions in the advanced economies have improved over the past year, but growth in global industrial production and trade remains subdued. Economic conditions in China have steadied recently, supported by growth in infrastructure and property construction, although medium-term risks to growth remain. Inflation remains below most central banks' targets. Commodity prices have risen over recent months, following the very substantial declines over the past few years. The higher commodity prices have supported a rise in Australia's terms of trade, although they remain much lower than they have been in recent years. Financial markets are functioning effectively. Funding costs for high-quality borrowers remain low and, globally, monetary policy remains remarkably accommodative. Government bond yields have risen, but are still low by historical standards. In Australia, the economy is growing at a moderate rate. The large decline in mining investment is being offset by growth in other areas, including residential construction, public demand and exports. Household consumption has been growing at a reasonable pace, but appears to have slowed a little recently. Measures of household and business sentiment remain above average. Labour market indicators continue to be somewhat mixed. The unemployment rate has declined this year, although there is considerable variation in employment growth across the country. Part-time employment has been growing strongly, but employment growth overall has slowed. The forward-looking indicators point to continued expansion in employment in the near term. Inflation remains quite low. The September quarter inflation data were broadly as expected, with underlying inflation continuing to run at around 1½ per cent. Subdued growth in labour costs and very low cost pressures elsewhere in the world mean that inflation is expected to remain low for some time. Low interest rates have been supporting domestic demand and the lower exchange rate since 2013 has been helping the traded sector. Financial institutions are in a position to lend for worthwhile purposes. These factors are assisting the economy to make the necessary adjustments, though an appreciating exchange rate could complicate this. The Bank's forecasts for output growth and inflation are little changed from those of three months ago. Over the next year, the economy is forecast to grow at close to its potential rate, before gradually strengthening. Inflation is expected to pick up gradually over the next two years. In the housing market, supervisory measures have strengthened lending standards and some lenders are taking a more cautious attitude to lending in certain segments. Turnover in the housing market and growth in lending for housing have slowed over the past year. The rate of increase in housing prices is also lower than it was a year ago, although prices in some markets have been rising briskly over the past few months. Considerable supply of apartments is scheduled to come on stream over the next couple of years, particularly in the eastern capital cities. Growth in rents is the slowest for some decades. Taking account of the available information, and having eased monetary policy at its May and August meetings, the Board judged that holding the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time. Don't Play Replay Replay Video Icon Player help icon Interest rates steady There was a case to cut, but new Reserve Bank Governor Philip Lowe has kept rates on hold. Peter Martin explains why. 2:30pm on 1 Nov 2016 The RBA has held rates steady at a record low 1.5 per cent. The outcome was expected by the wide majority of economists, and the decision was also baked in to market pricing. The central bank has cut its official cash rate target twice this year, in May and August. 2:12pm on 1 Nov 2016 The Bank of Japan has held off on expanding stimulus despite pushing back the time frame for hitting its 2 per cent inflation target, signalling that it will stand pat unless a severe market shock threatens to derail a fragile recovery. In a widely expected move, the BoJ maintained the 0.1 per cent interest it charges for a portion of excess reserves that financial institutions park with the central bank. At the two-day policy meeting that ended today, it also left unchanged its 10-year government bond yield target around zero per cent. While the BoJ no longer targets the pace of money printing, it maintained a pledge to keep buying government bonds so the balance of its holdings increases at an annual pace of 80 trillion yen. At a quarterly review of its forecasts, the BoJ cut its core consumer inflation forecast for the next fiscal year ending in March 2018 to 1.5 per cent from 1.7 per cent projected in July. BoJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda will hold a news conference at 5.30pm (AEDT) to explain the policy decision and the quarterly review. 2:06pm on 1 Nov 2016 One of Australia's best known contrarian fund managers has become the latest investor to warn that yield stocks may not be as safe as they are perceived to be. Allan Gray chief investment officer Simon Mawhinney argues that investors risk overpaying for "safety" if they are buying stocks such as infrastructure and utilities, which have been a winning trade up until the third quarter of this year when bonds showed signs of snapping a decades-long rally. "You do trade-off safety for price," he said. Mawhinney's biggest position is in Woodside Petroleum and he has been accumulating Nine Entertainment. "More and more money has been put into seemingly safe investments where the dividend yield or next year's earnings are relatively safe. Those investments have done very well over the past five years - staggeringly well - and it seems now there's quite a risk," the fund manager said. "Who knows what lies in store for us going forward? Mathematically they're nowhere nearly as cheap as they were five years ago." The risk to Allan Gray's thinking is that markets head for a period of heightened uncertainty, which drives investors back to the equity market's safe havens. A contrarian investor seeks out companies that are out of favour, capitalising on downbeat sentiment to seize on an under-valued opportunity. Markets have favoured income and growth investment biases amid record low interest rates. Here's more at the AFR ($) Allan Gray boss Simon Mawhinney says Australian executives are overpaid and improperly incentivised. Photo: Louise Kennerley 1:32pm on 1 Nov 2016 Vita Group has told the ASX that there is no information not yet available to the market that could explain yesterday's 13 per cent plunge in the company's share price or, presumably, the further 9 per cent drop today. The mobile phone retailer - which includes chains such as Fone Zone as well as some Telstra shops - did say that, "in line with normal commercial practice", Telstra "briefed Vita Group and the broader Telstra licensed channel in confidence about some potential changes to the remuneration construct". In the ASX statement, the company went on to say that it and the big telco were in "confidential discussions about those potential changes, and other strategic and tactical opportunities available to their partnership". The shares last fetched $3.73.   Back to top 1:06pm on 1 Nov 2016 BusinessDay columnist Michael Pascoe ponders the reality of a low interest rate, high house price world: Another month, another rise in average Australian capital city housing prices, up half a per cent in October, 2.7 per cent for the quarter, 7.5 per cent for the year. That's the reality of living in a low inflation, low interest rate world. In the big ticket cities of Sydney and Melbourne, the CoreLogic home value index scored monthly rises of 0.6 and 0.8 per cent respectively, with quarterly rises of 2.9 and 4.6 per cent, and 10.6 and 9.1 per cent for the year. For all the talk of supply and demand and zoning and population growth and foreigners and investors and negative gearing and discounted capital gains tax, the biggest single factor in pushing prices higher over the past year has been increased borrowing power – lower interest rates.  That's the unpleasant reality the Reserve Bank board has to deal with at today's meeting. Monetary policy has reached the point of providing stuff-all stimulus for anything other than increasing the bidding power of would-be buyers at housing auctions. And thus, despite core inflation weakening a touch more in the September quarter, the RBA is expected to leave rates unchanged this afternoon. On Friday, we'll get a full guide to the RBA's thinking in its quarterly statement on monetary policy. Odds are that it will show little change in the bank's inflation outlook as outlined by governor Philip Lowe – a slow rise over the next couple of years to the desired minimum level of 2 per cent.

Michael Pascoe comments. 12:58pm on 1 Nov 2016 Instead of bracing for drama, most investors will be seeking the finer points of the Bank of Japan's new policy framework as a two-day meeting comes to an end today. One focus is exactly how the BOJ will meet its new target for 10-year bond yields, and the implications for its asset purchases. The BOJ is also due to update its inflation and growth forecasts. It is widely expected to lower its inflation outlook, and extend the target date for reaching its 2 per cent price goal beyond the end of governor Haruhiko Kuroda's term in April 2018. All but two of the 43 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect no additional easing this month. The two who said they expected easing both forecast a cut to the negative interest rate. HSBC later dropped its call for the negative rate cut. Some 35 per cent of respondents said they though Kuroda's BOJ is done with expanding stimulus. Mari Iwashita, chief market economist at SMBC Friend Securities in Tokyo, is among those who think the central bank is unlikely to ease again under Kuroda. "There's a good chance that the BOJ will do nothing until Kuroda's term is over unless inflation expectations plunge or a global economic shock occurs," Iwashita said. The board meeting typically ends between noon and 1pm in Tokyo (3pm AEDT), with Kuroda to brief the press at 3:30pm (5:30pm). Kuroda, known for shocking market participants early in his tenure, in September shifted to a strategy focused on sustainability. The BOJ said it would seek to pin the 10-year government bond yield near zero, while keeping a rate on some commercial bank reserves at minus 0.1 per cent. Investors are still paying close attention to the BOJ's asset purchases, particularly of Japanese government bonds. The policy shift came as many concluded that the BOJ had neared the limits of its asset purchases. Kuroda has said he sees no immediate need to back away from the current JGB buying pace of 80 trillion yen ($1 trillion) a year to meet the 10-year yield target, while acknowledging the BOJ may not need to buy that much to do so. He has said purchases were likely to fluctuate. The yen has declined about 4.4 per cent against the US dollar and the Topix index has risen about 3 per cent since the last BOJ meeting on Sept. 21. Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda is expected to sit on his hands for the rest of his tenure. Photo: Andrew Harrer 12:37pm on 1 Nov 2016 What's the best outcome of the US elections for markets? Investors seem to favour a Clinton victory if only for the reason that she seems a much more predictable/stable candidate than her erratic opponent, and would in a way guarantee the status quo. But really it's hard to tell as it's questionable if some of both candidates' policies - for example, growth-friendly tax cuts - will be implemented the way they're being sold today. However, if history is any guide the best outcome for shares would be a Clinton victory but with Republicans retaining control of at least the House as this would be seen as "more of the same", AMP's Shane Oliver notes. Since 1927 US total share returns have been strongest at an average 16.7 per cent a year when there has been a Democrat president and Republican control of the House, the Senate or both. By contrast the return has only averaged 8.9 per cent a year when the Republicans controlled the presidency and Congress. Of course in those past decades the US didn't experience quite the level of partisan politics that over the past years have at times all but brought Washington to a standstill. Oliver also has a word of caution for investors: "Around the Brexit vote there was much concern a Yes vote would be a disaster for shares and the global economy. In the event there was an initial knee jerk sell-off but after a few days global markets moved on to focus on other things. So there is a danger in making too much of the US election." 12:18pm on 1 Nov 2016 Growth in China's vast manufacturing sector accelerated at the fastest pace in more than two years, while the services sector also grew faster. The official manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) jumped to 51.2, from 50.4 in September and above a predicted 50.3 reading, while the non-manufacturing PMI stood at 54.0 in October, compared to the previous month's reading of 53.7. Both came in well above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction on a monthly basis. China is counting on growth in services to offset persistent weakness in exports that is dragging on the world's second-largest economy. The economy expanded at a steady 6.7 per cent in the third quarter and looks set to hit Beijing's full-year target, fuelled by stronger government spending, record bank lending and a red-hot property market that are adding to its growing pile of debt 11:58am on 1 Nov 2016 Most economists tend to point to accelerating house prices as a reason the RBA won't cut rates today, but RBC head of Australian economics Su-Lin Ong sees the recent rally in bulk commodities as a major factor in the board's reasoning. Coal and iron ore - both key Australian exports - have posted strong gains over the past months, rising to five-year and six-month highs respectively, with particularly coking coal up a stunning 150 per cent since August. Ong notes the move in bulk prices underpinned a rise in terms of trade in the past two quarters. "Importantly, this is narrowing the gap between national income and output growth, with the former a key metric that we have long favoured and a key driver, in our view, of RBA policy action." Based on the bulk commodity developments and their implications for national income, she reckons the RBA is unlikely to cut any further. Ong says the chart below suggests that divergence can occur (for example, mid-2013 amid mini Chinese fiscal stimulus), "but at this stage of the rate cycle, these commodity developments may carry more weight".

Home Surveys Lists Events Webcasts Videos Opinions Thought Leadership For the world's largest asset owners Headlines October 31, 2016 6:51 PM EST EY Pension Appoints New Investment Chief Walter Kress, who formerly managed JP Morgan’s retirement funds, is in his first month in the new position.  Walter KressOne of the “Big Four” consulting giants EY has tapped a new investment chief and treasurer for its pension fund, CIO has confirmed. Walter Kress, who began his new role in October, is now responsible for managing the US firm’s pension and retirement plan investment portfolios, according to his LinkedIn. Based in Secaucus, New Jersey, Kress is also in charge of developing a long-term strategy that is in line with EY’s operational priorities. The new CIO comes from serving nearly 10 years at JP Morgan as managing director and COO for the New York-based financial giant’s retirement plans. There, he was responsible for the plans’ investment operations as well as “the oversight of the nonmarketable alternatives,” his LinkedIn said. Kress also spent more than two decades in a variety of positions at Mellon Institutional Asset Management, primarily retail fund manager Dreyfus, and Prudential Securities. He holds a bachelor’s degree in finance and economics from Syracuse University and is also an elected member of the board of finance in Wilton, Connecticut.

Over the next five-to-10 years, the miners need new production to replace almost 170 million tons of capacity that’ll be lost as exhausted pits are closed and grades decline at aging operations, according to Global Mining Research Ltd. Even with forecasts that demand for seaborne supply will peak in 2018 and prices may drop below $40 a ton that year, new iron ore projects are seen offering better returns than some alternative investments. “Economically, it still makes a lot of sense to invest that level of capex, given the returns that these mines are likely to generate,” said Michelle Lopez, a Sydney-based investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management Ltd., which holds BHP Billiton Ltd. and Rio Tinto Group shares and globally manages $403 billion. Yet, the decisions will be difficult and “for the first time they are actually up against real capital constraints, they haven’t had that in the past couple of years,” she said. The collapse in commodity prices in the past five years will see total global capital spending by mining companies drop about 60 percent to a forecast $57 billion next year, from $145 billion at the peak in 2012, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. estimates. Fortescue Metals Group Ltd., the No. 4 iron ore exporter, plans to make a decision within six months on a potential $1.5 billion investment to replace output, Chief Executive Officer Nev Power said last week. Rio Tinto, which in August approved its $338 million Silvergrass mine, needs to develop a 50-million-ton mine about every five years to hold production steady, JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in an August note. Miners in Western Australia’s iron-rich Pilbara region need prices between $36 a ton and $51 a ton to justify replacement expansions, which could total $8.2 billion, the bank estimates. Prices in the $50 a ton to $60 a ton range will provide sufficient incentive for investments in expansions, according to global consulting firm EY. If prices collapse, then mine projects “may be shelved as the majors find better uses of their limited capital across the rest of the minerals portfolio,” according to Paul Mitchell, EY’s global mining and metals advisory leader. “It is obvious that these replacement mines can never be considered to be ‘guaranteed’ in an uncertain world.” Benchmark iron ore has averaged $54.70 in 2016, according to Metal Bulletin Ltd. data. Iron ore’s rebound in 2016 from three straight annual declines isn’t sustainable and the market may need as long as a decade to rebalance, Rio’s CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques was cited by 21st Century Business Herald as saying last month in Beijing. He echoed similar comments by BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie. About 30 percent of Melbourne-based BHP’s current iron ore output in Australia will need to be replaced as the 80 million ton Yandi mine ceases production in about fiscal 2023, according to Macquarie Group Ltd. BHP rose 0.4 percent to A$22.66 in Sydney trading Thursday, as Fortescue advanced 0.6 percent and Rio declined 0.5 percent. ‘Finite Capital’ Even if there’s lower demand from China, iron ore production is likely to remain a high margin business, BHP’s Mackenzie said in August. It would be “perfectly possible, in that environment, that we would still be able to justify an extension or a replacement,” he told investors on an earnings call. Rio and BHP both declined to specify when they expect to take decisions on potential investments in replacement mines. Both producers have warned a proposed additional levy on their iron ore operations in Western Australia would put new projects in jeopardy. The investment decisions will be made as China, the top commodities consumer, looks likely to favor other metals, including copper, as its economy shifts from growth rooted in steel-intensive infrastructure projects. Global refined copper demand may grow about 7 percent through 2020, more than double the rate of the world’s iron ore imports over the same period, Barclays Plc analysts including Dane Davis wrote in a Nov. 1 note. Iron ore developments will also need to compete against growth options in other commodities, according to researcher CRU Group. “There are internal fights for capital within the businesses, they are going to be allocating a finite amount of money across their whole portfolios,” Adrian Doyle, a Sydney-based senior consultant at CRU, said by phone.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION Certain information contained in this press release, including any information as to the Company's strategy, projects, plans or future financial or operating performance, constitutes "forward-looking statements". All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements. The words "expect", "will", "may" and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon a number of estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by the Company or Barrick North America Finance LLC as at the date of this press release in light of management's experience and perception of current conditions and expected developments, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies. Known and unknown factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements and information. Such factors include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold, copper or certain other commodities (such as silver, diesel fuel, natural gas and electricity); failure to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations; timing of receipt of, or failure to comply with, necessary permits and approvals; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development; changes in mineral production performance, exploitation and exploration successes; diminishing quantities or grades of reserves; increased costs, delays, suspensions and technical challenges associated with the construction of capital projects; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or development activities, including geotechnical challenges and disruptions in the maintenance or provision of required infrastructure and information technology systems; the impact of global liquidity and credit availability on the timing of cash flows and the values of assets and liabilities based on projected future cash flows; the impact of inflation; fluctuations in the currency markets; changes in U.S. dollar interest rates; changes in national and local government legislation, taxation, controls or regulations and/or changes in the administration of laws, policies and practices, expropriation or nationalization of property and political or economic developments in Argentina, Canada, the United States and other jurisdictions in which the Company does or may carry on business in the future; lack of certainty with respect to foreign legal systems, corruption and other factors that are inconsistent with the rule of law; damage to the Company's reputation due to the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, including negative publicity with respect to the Company's handling of environmental matters or dealings with community groups, whether true or not; risk of loss due to acts of war, terrorism, sabotage and civil disturbances; litigation; contests over title to properties, particularly title to undeveloped properties, or over access to water, power and other required infrastructure; risks associated with working with partners in jointly controlled assets; employee relations including loss of key employees; increased costs and physical risks, including extreme weather events and resource shortages, related to climate change; and availability and increased costs associated with mining inputs and labor. In addition, there are risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins, flooding and gold bullion, copper cathode or gold or copper concentrate losses (and the risk of inadequate insurance, or inability to obtain insurance, to cover these risks). Many of these uncertainties and contingencies can affect the Company's actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company or Barrick North America Finance LLC. Readers are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. All of the forward-looking statements made in this press release are qualified by these cautionary statements. Specific reference is made to "Narrative Description of the Business-Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources" and "Risk Factors" in the annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2015, and to the management's discussion and analysis in respect of the annual audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the management's discussion and analysis in respect of the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, each of which is on file with the SEC and Canadian provincial securities regulatory authorities and incorporated by reference in the Offer to Purchase, and to the section "Certain Significant Consequences for Holders" in the Offer to Purchase, for a more detailed discussion of some of the factors underlying forward-looking statements and the risks that may affect the Company's ability to achieve the expectations set forth in the forward-looking statements contained in this press release. The Offerors disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law.

Photo: AP mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 4:00 AM, November 3, 2016 With the most unconventional election in modern American history drawing to a close, investors worldwide have begun hedging their bets that voters will keep a Democrat in the White House and Republicans in control of at least one chamber of Congress. Given all of the October surprises, that may not be a bad idea. Below is a look at potential winners and losers depending on who wins and loses. But first, a caveat. Investors’ immediate reaction to US elections often does not last. Stocks Clinton wins: “The market has already priced in a (Hillary) Clinton victory,” said Ms Margaret Yang, a CMC Markets analyst in Singapore. “Any upside will be limited if she wins.” Barclays said in a report this week that the S&P 500 Index could gain as much as 3 per cent if she wins. The benchmark lost ground on Tuesday for the sixth straight session. The biggest losers would be finance and drug companies. “A potential Democratic sweep would represent one of the toughest election outcomes for banks,” Morgan Stanley Research said in a report, citing the possibility of tougher rules and tax changes that might hurt companies like Goldman Sachs and J P Morgan Chase. Under Mrs Clinton, pharmaceutical and biotech stocks “could be hit by renewed pressure to curb price increases on drugs”, BlackRock researchers said in a report, noting her complaints about rising prices. Citigroup had cut its rating on the European healthcare industry to underweight in September, citing risks related to the election. Her plans to reduce dependence on fossil fuels would boost alternative energy producers. Trump wins: “Valuations of US equities are quite high, and a Trump victory will trigger a massive selloff,” CMC’s Ms Yang said. Many would consider that a classic “black swan event”, she added, so the reaction would be “much more severe” than Brexit, which caused the S&P 500 Index to fall 5.3 per cent in two days as benchmarks in Europe and elsewhere lost even more. Investors seeking haven in the yen would be “a negative for Japanese exporters”, Ms Yang said. Barclays predicted the S&P 500 would nosedive by between 11 per cent and 13 per cent if Mr Donald Trump wins. The Republican’s shifting policy positions make his longer-term impact on particular sectors harder to assess. BlackRock’s analysis of the correlation between the two candidate’s polling numbers and sector stock performance suggest drugmakers, insurers and banks are expected to do better under Mr Trump. Bloomberg News did a similar analysis for individual US stocks. Companies that build and maintain civil infrastructure would have bigger opportunities for government work under Mr Trump, given that his plans for such spending are much more ambitious than Mrs Clinton’s. The same holds true for military contractors, according to a Credit Suisse report. Currencies Clinton wins: The US dollar would gain versus other developed-market currencies with the Democrat heading towards the White House as traders focus attention on the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in December, according to Capital Economics, a London-based research firm. Bank of America sees the greenback gaining under Mrs Clinton only if the Democrats take Congress. Currencies from emerging markets have mostly priced in a Clinton win, which would be neutral or positive for all countries except Russia, Societe Generale said in a report. The Mexican peso would benefit from a Clinton win more than any other emerging-market currency, Societe Generale said. It has acted as a barometer of the presidential contest, tending to move in tandem with her chances of defeating a candidate who promised to make the United States’ southern neighbour pay for a wall between the two countries. Look for China’s yuan to “strengthen modestly in response to a Clinton win as currencies sensitive to the outlook for global trade rally in relief”, said Mr Sean Callow, senior strategist at Westpac Banking in Sydney. Trump wins: The foreign exchange markets this week are suggesting what might happen if the Republican triumphs, with the dollar tumbling against almost all major currencies and the Mexican peso falling to a three-week low. Even after the immediate shock of a Trump win, the US dollar may weaken as developed-market currencies including the yen, euro, pound and franc rally on concern that China would dump US assets and the Fed would delay tightening monetary policy. The greenback could then rally in a three- to nine-month horizon as Republicans usher in tax cuts and other fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth, Bank of America said. The candidate’s hostility towards China — including threats of steep tariffs over alleged currency manipulation — would likely drive the offshore yuan down about 3 per cent by year’s end, said Mr Ken Cheung, a foreign exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. Longer term, the currency may fall more gradually under Mr Trump as he exerts political pressure on the country’s leaders to slow its depreciation, said Mr Xu Gao, an economist at Everbright Securities in Beijing. Risk adversity in the aftermath of a Trump win would also hurt other developing-world currencies on fears that his protectionist stance could hurt emerging economies by reducing imports from them. The South Korean won may take a hit, given questions Mr Trump has raised about the need for US troops on the North Korean border. Emerging Markets Clinton wins: It will be risk-on if the Democrat retains control of the White House, which bodes well for developing markets. Investors may respond by bidding up Chinese defence shares because Mrs Clinton comes across as the more hawkish candidate, said Mr Francis Cheung, head of China and Hong Kong strategy at CLSA. Commodity producers in the developing world might rally on expectations that US demand will increase along with infrastructure spending. Trump wins: “I can’t think of any country that would benefit if Trump wins,” CMC Markets’ Ms Yang said. Evercore’s report mentioned one nation that might get a boost, suggesting investors buy Russian equities to hedge against the Clinton-leaning polls being wrong. Citigroup sees the MSCI Emerging Markets Index immediately falling at least 10 per cent, with Mexican stocks leading the way down. One possible bright spot for Mexico: Construction companies may be positioned for contracts to build Mr Trump’s proposed border wall. In Asia, “China will bear the brunt of risks if Trump wins”, said Mr Ken Peng, an investment strategist at Citi Private Bank in Hong Kong. “He’ll probably introduce trade policies targeted against China,” weakening its economy. Protectionist US policies would also be “bad for a lot of economies that rely a lot on exports”, said Mr Ben Bei, an analyst at CIMB Securities in Hong Kong. Mr Peng said exporters from South Korea and Taiwan are among those with the most to lose. Ms Yang adds South-east Asian exporters to the list, including companies in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. To the extent that Mr Trump is less welcoming to workers from abroad, his victory may hurt the Philippines’ broader economy, which gets the bulk of its overseas remittances from Filipinos employed in the US, Ms Yang said. “India and Indonesia will be least affected if Trump wins”, due to their robust domestic growth, Mr Peng said. Commodities Clinton wins: Her environmental policies, especially her promise to combat climate change, will put pressure on coal and oil. The natural gas market could get a boost from her pledge to wean power plants off coal by using gas as “a bridge” to more reliance on renewables. Trump wins: Natural gas prices would likely suffer as coal benefits under Mr Trump. He has promised to roll back environmental rules that squeeze coal out of the US power market and promoted “clean coal” during one of the debates. Bloomberg Intelligence in September estimated a victory by the Republican would shave 11 per cent off natural gas demand in 2030 from last year’s levels, boosting coal use. Oil prices could get a lift from the return of a risk premium if Mr Trump continues with the “bellicose language that has been heard on the campaign trail” about Iran and scraps President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with the country, said Mr John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York hedge fund focused on energy. Gold, platinum and silver would the “biggest winners” if Mr Trump wins, said Ms Yang, the CMC Markets analyst. To see why, look at what happened right after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced it will examine newly discovered emails relevant to its inquiry of Mrs Clinton’s use of a private Internet server as secretary of state: Gold futures rallied to a three-week high because demand for the metal as a haven jumped. Since the day before the FBI’s announcement, all precious metals were up. Copper may also get a bounce, Barclays said, citing moves in the metal’s price during the campaign suggesting “a Trump-related premium in infrastructure-related assets given expectations around his fiscal plan.” BLOOMBERG mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Business READ COMMENTED “India really means business”: Iswaran ’appy iPhone users as WhatsApp Web goes iOS ‘Your fried rice’s ready, Chef’ ‘Unicorns’ face up to reality of new dotcom bubble ‘Tweaks' to property cooling measures worth exploring, say industry players Yum unit Taco Bell to have 8,000 U.S. outlets by end-2022 World debut: Jaguar unveils all-electric I-Pace SUV With 'change in the air', PM May asks business to help on economy While India plugs black money holes, Indians find leaks What’s most worrying about the current economic climate?

Alts Currency-Hedged Equities Fixed-Income New ETFs Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2016 → November → Europe ETFs Could Shine Next Year Europe ETFs Could Shine Next Year Tom Lydon November 2, 2016 0 Comment currency hedged ETFs, equities, EZU, featured, HEDJ, HEZU European stocks and the corresponding exchange traded funds have, for much of 2016, been disappointments, but some market observers believe with the euro poised to weaken and the dollar gaining momentum, European equities could deliver for investors next year. According to JPMorgan Asset Management, the European stock market has gotten too cheap to resist, with valuations on the MSCI Europe ex-UK Index and the FTSE All-Shares Index at attractive valuations when their price-to-earnings ratios are adjusted for inflation over the past 10 years, reports Aleksandra Gjorgievska for Bloomberg. Related: Brexit Opens Opportunity for Europe ETFs ETFs such as the WisdomTree Europe Hedged Equity Fund (NYSEArca: HEDJ) and the iShares MSCI EMU ETF (NYSEArca: EZU), which is not currency hedged, have been hindered by a surprisingly strong euro, but that is a scenario that could change as well. The European Central Bank (ECB) has been an issue for investors this year, but the ECB recently noted it will not taper its quantitative easing program, at least not in the near-term. Market observers argued that the ECB could even extend its bond purchasing program to further support inflation. The ECB has already spent over a trillion euros buying government bonds, cut its benchmark rate to zero and adopted a negative deposit rate.

He cited a trade like getting long the German DAX index and short the Dow,” Boris Schlossberg, managing director of foreign exchange strategy for BK Asset Management told CNBC.

Consequently, investors who expect in an improving Eurozone economy, along with a depreciating euro currency, should consider currency-hedged ETF options to gain exposure to the region. For instance, the Deutsche X-trackers MSCI EMU Hedged Equity ETF (NYSEArca: DBEZ), iShares Currency Hedged MSCI EMU ETF (NYSEArca: HEZU) and the aforemetioned HEDJ target Eurozone countries but try to diminish the negative effects of a depreciating EUR – a weakening foreign currency would normally reduce returns on overseas securities when converted back into a stronger U.S. dollar.

(JPM) Stock Since It’s Priced for Perfection Stock of even the highest-quality banks fall and JPM is no exception By Nicolas Chahine, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Nov 2, 2016, 11:41 am EST     Popular Posts: Alphabet Inc (GOOG, GOOGL) Stock Can Earn You Free Money Get Paid to Catch the Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Knife 2 Gold Stocks to Profit From for Cheap (JNUG GDX) Recent Posts: Get Paid to Catch the Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Knife Fill Your Cup With Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Stock 2 Gold Stocks to Profit From for Cheap (JNUG GDX) View All Posts JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) has had a great rally this year and is now butting up against prior failure levels. Other banks like Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) also are enjoying nice gains off their lows. The exchange-traded fund Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLF) is finally showing signs of life. Source: via Wikimedia From here there might be trouble, though. And to prepare for that, I want to try and pick on a few financial stocks. JPM stock stuck out as one challenging highs. If I am correct that there could be trouble, a stock at its highs is usually one of the first place sellers hit. Click to Enlarge This is not so as much a short on JPMorgan Chase itself as it is a short on markets in general. The U.S. Federal Reserve will eventually take more steps into their rate hike cycle and that will have a negative effect on equity prices in general. The perception is that Banks profit with higher rates. 9 Shiny New Dividend Stocks You Can Trust in the Long Run So, financials may at first rally with the rate hike but I believe that this will be temporary, as was the case last year. Banks will eventually follow the general equity markets’ move. JPM Stock Trade Trade No. 1 — The Bet: Buy JPM Dec $67.50/$65 debit put spread. This is a bearish trade for which I pay per 60 cents contract. This is my maximum potential loss. To profit, I need JPM stock to fall through both legs of my spread before it expires. If JPM stock drops below $65, I stand to gain $1.90 per contract. I usually like to lower my entry costs by setting an opposing trade. Usually it’s a bullish credit spread. In this case and since markets are currently nervous days ahead of the elections, I may delay the entry a few hours just in case we get a poll report showing a Trump lead. Trade No. 2 – The Bank (Optional): Sell JPM Nov $66/$65 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 15 cents per contract. Ideally here I need JPM stock to stay above my spread through the November expiration. This has a theoretical 85% chance of success and a 4% price buffer from current levels. The yield if successful would be 17% on money risked. Ideally I need this spread to expire worthless, at which point I have discounted my entry price for the December short by the 15-cent credit per contract. Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) New MacBook Pro Already Needs a Price Cut This sounds complicated, but the idea is simple: From here, I believe there is more downside risk in JPM than upside potential. I want to capture that move as cheaply as possible. I am not obliged to hold any of the positions through the expiration. I can close for partial gains or losses at any time. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com. As of this writing, he did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Skip to content Satellite Press Releases Satellite Press Releases and News Milbank Partners Michael Bellucci and Jerome McCluskey Author 2nd Edition of LSTA's Complete Credit Agreement Guide NEW YORK, Nov. 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Global Leveraged Finance partners Michael Bellucci and Jerome McCluskey of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy LLP have published a comprehensively updated manual for the global syndicated credit market,  The LSTA’s Complete Credit Agreement Guide, Second Edition, in conjunction with the Loan Syndications & Trading Association (LSTA). Seven years and one global financial crisis after the first edition of the guide, Messrs. Bellucci and McCluskey and have produced a one-stop resource, covering all layers of the international loan market and reflecting the transformations and upheavals that have shaped syndicated credit agreements since 2009. The first edition quickly won an industry-wide reputation as the definitive reference, and the new edition remains the only updated single-volume guide to navigate the syndicated loan market and its underlying credit agreements. Andrew O’Brien, global head of Loan Capital Strategy for JPMorgan Chase, calls the second edition: “an excellent resource that provides clear explanation and rationale for the more complex components of today’s credit agreements. It is a very useful tool for anyone involved in the loan market.” Thomas Finke, CEO of global investment manager Barings LLC, said: “This is the comprehensive resource for deciphering the complexities of a syndicated credit agreement. A must-have guide for today’s global loan market that unbundles the intricate layers of credit terms, market trends, and global forces that together impact the ultimate deal cut between the corporate borrower and its lenders.” The book will be available in hardcover and electronically. In addition to all eRetailers, the book can be purchased from: Amazon Barnes & Noble The LSTA’s Complete Credit Agreement Guide portrays the many changes that have occurred among lenders as well as borrowers since the recession and closely covers the evolving regulatory landscape of credit agreement provisions.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Editorial Columns Letters Books Blogs Not enough   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet SEBI’s new rules for rating agencies focus mainly on operating procedures; what’s needed are stronger checks on conflicts of interest As large corporate groups grapple with high debt and delay loan repayments , the risk of such distress afflicting other segments of the financial system remains a live one. Some leveraged firms raise bonds and deposits directly from the public; others borrow from debt mutual funds which deploy retail money. In such cases, investor interests are sought to be protected mainly by requiring issuers to obtain credit ratings from independent rating agencies. But certain incidents in the past year have exposed chinks in the armour of the rating agencies themselves. A sudden default and suspension of credit ratings on a bond rated ‘investment grade’ from Amtek Auto led to sharp write-downs and losses for investors in two debt funds run by JP Morgan Asset Management Company. Sudden and steep downgrades in the bonds of some steelmakers have delivered nasty jolts to investors. SEBI’s recent circular calling for “enhanced standards for credit rating agencies” is ostensibly aimed at addressing these chinks. The circular seems to be devoted mainly to standardising the policies and processes at the rating agencies. Therefore, SEBI lays down detailed checks on what will constitute a ‘default’ on each instrument, asks rating agencies to specify financial ratios used for credit assessments, and provides a template for the rating released to the public. Rating agencies will also be required to make public disclosures of the periodicity at which ratings will be reviewed or placed on watch. There are just a couple of new rules that may serve a useful purpose for investors. One, when rating a new instrument, agencies will now be required to carry a three-year rating history of all other instruments from the same issuer. This should help investors gauge the overall creditworthiness of the borrower. Two, raters will no longer be allowed to suspend ratings and blank out issuers if they refuse to disclose information. They will instead be required to monitor a debt instrument over its entire life (with requisite disclaimers), even if the issuer fails to cooperate. While these tweaks are useful to avoid a repeat of JP Morgan-type episodes, SEBI has stopped short of actually pulling up rating agencies for abrupt rating suspensions and downgrades. It has also tiptoed around the biggest regulatory challenge confronting the rating business worldwide — the blatant conflict of interest arising from issuers (and not users) paying the rating fee. In India, this problem is compounded by rating agencies also offering a range of advisory services to corporate clients which may allow them to subtly influence ratings. SEBI has mandated a Chinese wall by requiring that people with business responsibilities play no part in rating decisions. But stronger regulatory checks are needed to ensure that rating agencies work in the best interests of investors, rather than their rating clients.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 7:30 PM, November 2, 2016 Updated: 8:00 PM, November 2, 2016 TOKYO - The U.S. presidential election is unlikely to be a major risk for financial markets as Congress is likely to put a brake on many policies, whoever wins, the fixed income chief investment officer of JPMorgan Asset Management said on Wednesday. Bob Michele said the world's fifth largest asset manager increased exposure to inflation-linked bonds (TIPS) and emerging market debt in the last few weeks, expecting moderate growth and solid oil prices to lift inflation and support emerging market currencies. Global financial markets were roiled by signs the U.S. presidential election race was tightening just days ahead of the Nov. 8 vote, with a possible victory for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump seen as boosting uncertainty on U.S. foreign, economic and trade policies. But Michele told Reuters in an interview that U.S. politics is not among the major risk factors the firm looks at in coming months because the House of Representatives is likely to remain Republican. "This is very important because any law that the President would like to pass has to go through the House for approval," he said. "We are in an interesting position where, if (Hillary) Clinton gets elected, the House - if it remains Republican - will likely push back a lot of things she wants to do. "But if Trump gets elected and he tries to push through a lot of the extremist, protectionist things he has talked about, I expect the House will push that back." Since both candidates are highlighting the need to rebuild U.S. infrastructure, fiscal expansion is likely, whoever wins, Michele said. In addition, U.S. and world growth look better than expected at the start of 2016 and oil prices have recovered sharply from 12-year lows hit early this year, which is likely to underpin prices in coming months. "There's a lot that will happen in a couple of weeks that will appear to be very growth friendly and very inflation-oriented, including the election," he added. "Many of the things we're doing now are to prepare in advance." JPMorgan's <JPM.N> asset management arm has added local emerging markets debt, Michele added, citing high real yield, upsides to growth and stabilization of currencies, thanks to recovering energy prices. He named Brazil, India, Indonesia and Russia as attractive targets, adding that it was a good time to take the currency exposure as well. Michele, who manages the firm's $455-billion fixed income portfolios, also said it was looking for opportunities to sell duration. "When markets rally, we would use that as an opportunity to cut duration of our portfolios because we think the market is going through a growth and inflation scare." JPMorgan Asset Management had $1.77 trillion in assets under management by September 30.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    While strategists and pundits fall over each other predicting how the U.S. presidential race will play out in markets, the stock market itself has a clear-cut view on which industry is most at risk: the banks. Financial institutions come up far more often than any other industry when share price correlation is plotted for sensitivity to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton’s election odds. Among the 100 stocks in the S&P 500 with the strongest ties, companies from JPMorgan Chase & Co. to Progressive Corp., are moving the most based on politics. Their clear preference is for Trump. “There are things Democrats want to do that could hurt these companies and things Republicans want to do that will help them, and that’s why these correlations are so strong,” said Dan Clifton, head of policy research at Strategas Research Partners in Washington. “Financials are not priced for the event that you get a Democrat sweep. Markets are paying more attention to Fed policy and not enough to the election.” It’s not like bank shareholders need more drama this year. Financial stocks began 2016 by plunging 18 percent over six weeks, dragged down by concerns a recession was about to steamroll their lending business. Scandals, fines and firings have dogged the group since the bottom in February, with volatility cresting after Britain’s vote to leave the European Union sent banks down 8 percent in two days. Heavy correlation to the candidates is something else to process for bulls and bears as the Federal Reserve considers higher interest rates and signs of inflation emerge in the economy. Flows into and out of bank shares have been among the heaviest in the S&P 500 this year, with a net $300 billion pulled from the largest financial exchange-traded fund in 2016, the most since 2011. Financials For Trump While pretty much every industry has demonstrated an occasional preference for one party or another during the election season, none has been as tied to poll numbers on the RealClearPolitics website as financial companies. They’re the only ones that have moved in lockstep with the Republican’s odds while also moving inversely to Clinton’s numbers, suggesting investors believe the biggest difference between the candidates’ political agendas may be how they deal with Wall Street. Banks, online brokerages and diversified financial companies make up 20 of the top 50 companies most tied to Trump’s numbers, almost double the next most common group, technology stocks. Morgan Stanley sits atop the list, with a correlation of 0.68 to Trump’s polls since March, followed by E*Trade Financial Corp. and Fifth Third Bancorp, with correlations of at least 0.62. At the same time, many of those companies move inversely with Clinton’s chances. In the top 100 most polarized stocks, financial shares on average have a correlation of negative 0.24 with Clinton and a positive correlation of 0.41 with Trump. That spread is bigger than in any other group. “If you think Hillary wins but Republicans keep the house, it is trickier because more factors come into play given how wide the polls have become,” said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at Weeden & Co. in Greenwich, Connecticut. “You want to be thoughtful around big banks, especially those most exposed to more Dodd-Frank.” Clinton Correlations Outside of financials and the handful of chipmakers that trade with Trump, the most discernible correlation between the election and industries are ones associated with a victory by Clinton. Among the 100 companies most correlated to politics, 69 are because of moderate to strong inverse relationships with her numbers, suggesting the effects of a Clinton administration on specific companies is more easily interpreted or that polls represent a stronger signal about her chances. Of the top 50 stocks most closely tied to Clinton’s polls, 21 fall in the consumer discretionary category, and the correlations are, on average, stronger than the companies that stand to benefit from a Trump election. Topping the list are retailers like Nordstrom Inc. and Tiffany & Co. and automotive stocks including Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. and BorgWarner Inc. The two groups have traded with positive correlations of at least 0.73 and 0.67 to the RealClearPolitics numbers. Not all of the equity market has shown a clear preference for a candidate. Some of the strongest relationships between stocks and polling show up in industrial shares, where strong correlations exist both for Trump’s and Clinton’s numbers. A possible reason: Both candidates will expand federal spending in an effort to jump-start the economy. “Beneficiaries of increased fiscal spending, such as construction and materials, have already rallied in anticipation of greater infrastructure spending post-election,” analysts at BlackRock Inc. wrote in an Oct. 25 note. “Yet this outperformance may be premature, as new fiscal programs take time to trickle down to corporate bottom lines.”   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.
