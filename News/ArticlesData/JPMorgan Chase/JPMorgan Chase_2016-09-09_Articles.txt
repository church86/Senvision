Just two days before the S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq Composite dropped by about two percent each, Marko Kolanovic, JPMorgan's Global Head of Derivatives and Quantitative Research, warned investors in a research note that stocks were on the verge of breaking out of a 'dead zone'—and volatility was about to surge. Now that stocks have seen the worst sell-off in months, the analyst's warning appears prescient. "We expect definitely an increase in volatility in September—more likely than not a sell-off as well," Marko Kolanovic told CNBC's "Fast Money" in an interview this week. "It would be triggered by high volatility, deleveraging from various systematic strategies and some of these options effects that are going in reverse." The CBOE Volatility Index is now at its highest level in more than two months. "If you look at the S&P price action over the past two months, it's been in an extremely tight range. Actually, it's one of the longest periods of the market really not moving at all," he said. However, that all changed on Friday, when the S&P saw its largest move since June. It came as the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its first triple point loss since July 5. Kolanovic, who early this year correctly told "Fast Money" viewers that both gold and crude oil would rebound, does not believe the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its September meeting. Yet, given the uncertainty surrounding that meeting as well as the presidential election, it has the capacity to drive volatility above seasonal levels and contribute to more downward pressure on stocks. By the end of the year, Kolanovic believes the market will move higher. "December tends to be the strongest month," noted Kolanvic. "Once the election is out of the way, it could provide some certainty and some boost to the market."

Pedestrians pass in front of the JPMorgan Chase headquarters building in New York. Macquarie's David Konrad, one of the Wall Street's top analysts, lowered his rating on JPMorgan Chase to neutral from outperform, citing the stock's full valuation and slower investment banking trends. "Although we believe a premium valuation [for JPMorgan] is warranted due to better-than-peer returns with less earnings volatility, the current P/E multiple appears full relative to historical valuations," Konrad wrote in a note to clients Friday. "Although we expect continued strong loan growth and operating leverage, the interest rate environment remains a headwind for NIM and expense initiatives are largely embedded in expectations." Konrad's picks have a 29.9 percent one-year average return with a 92 percent success rate, according to analyst ranking service TipRanks, placing him in the top 10 percent of all Wall Street analysts covering any industry.

(NYSE: JPM) has moved from trading at a 19 percent discount valuation to a 7 percent premium valuation, which Macquarie’s David Konrad views a warranted, given the company’s “relatively less volatility of earnings, better-than-peer ROTCE and market share gains.” Konrad downgraded the rating on the company to Neutral, while lowering the price target from $72 to $70. Challenging Environment However, the analyst expects the interest rate environment to continue to be challenging, while cost saving expectations are mostly factored into the consensus forecasts. Related Link: Rate Hike Bets Spurred August Inflows To Financial ETFs “Moreover, a meaningfully improved ROE may be challenging with higher-than-peer required capital buffers,” Konrad mentioned. In-Line Expectations The analyst pointed out the revised estimates were now 1 percent below consensus for 2017 and 2 percent below consensus for 2018, which can be considered as relatively in line. “Although we expect continued strong loan growth and operating leverage, the interest rate environment remains a headwind for NIM and expense initiatives are largely embedded in expectations,” Konrad cautioned. Capital Distribution On the other hand, the analyst expects capital distribution to remain strong, although greater improvement is likely from some of JPMorgan Chase’s peers. The EPS estimates for 2016, 2017 and 2018 have been lowered to reflect the rate and capital market expectations. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

our ability to implement integration plans for the merger and to recognize the anticipated growth, benefits, cost savings and synergies of the merger; the risks that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement disrupt current plans and operations and the potential difficulties in retention of any members of senior management of Valence Health and any other key employees that Evolent is interested in retaining after the closing of the merger; the limitations placed on the ability of Evolent and Valence Health to operate their respective businesses by the merger agreement; the effect of the announcement of the merger on Evolent's and Valence Health's business relationships, customers, suppliers, other partners, standing with regulators, operating results and businesses generally; the amount of any costs, fees, expenses, impairments and charges related to the merger; and the market price for our Class A common stock potentially being affected, following the merger, by factors that historically have not affected the market price for our Class A common stock; the structural change in the market for health care in the United States; our ability to effectively manage our growth; the significant portion of revenue we derive from our largest partners; our ability to offer new and innovative products and services; the growth and success of our partners, which is difficult to predict and is subject to factors outside of our control, including premium pricing reductions and the ability to control and, if necessary, reduce health care costs; our ability to attract new partners; our ability to recover the significant upfront costs in our partner relationships; our ability to estimate the size of our target market; our ability to maintain and enhance our reputation and brand recognition; consolidation in the health care industry; competition which could limit our ability to maintain or expand market share within our industry; our ability to partner with providers due to exclusivity provisions in our contracts; uncertainty in the health care regulatory framework; restrictions and penalties as a result of privacy and data protection laws; adequate protection of our intellectual property; any alleged infringement, misappropriation or violation of third-party proprietary rights; our use of "open source" software; our ability to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information; our reliance on third parties; our ability to use, disclose, de-identify or license data and to integrate third-party technologies; data loss or corruption due to failures or errors in our systems and service disruptions at our data centers; breaches or failures of our security measures; our reliance on Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties and our own systems for providing services to our users;

our future indebtedness and our ability to obtain additional financing; our ability to achieve profitability in the future; the requirements of being a public company; our adjusted results may not be representative of our future performance;

the ability of certain of our investors to compete with us without restrictions; provisions in our certificate of incorporation which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees; our intention not to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock; and our status as an "emerging growth company." The risks included here are not exhaustive.  Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements.  Our 2015 Form 10-K and other documents filed with the SEC include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors. Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.

Chase has run out of the alloy, whose composition is a trade secret. AP High-end, high-fee, high-reward credit card is the hottest thing out there Sep 9, 2016 (…) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS The Chase Sapphire Reserve Card from JPMorgan Chase is made of a metallic alloy. Chase has run out of the alloy, whose composition is a trade secret. NEW YORK (AP) — The demand has been so overwhelming that the manufacturer ran out of raw material in just a few days. Enthusiasts extol its virtues all over the Internet. Millennials are clamoring for it. It’s not a new video game, or some fancy food craze, or even Apple’s latest iPhone, but a credit card. Calling it plastic wouldn’t do it justice. It is a high-end, high-fee, high-reward card made of a metallic alloy that gives it a satisfying heft and an impressive thunk when you toss it onto the table to pick up the check. The Chase Sapphire Reserve Card has become the hottest card on the market just two weeks after being introduced, even though it came out during the slow, end-of-summer period, it carries a hefty $450 annual fee, and JPMorgan Chase spent nothing on advertising it. “I’m telling all my friends about it,” said Maddy Novich, 33, of New York, who applied for the card, as did her husband. “I have never seen such interest in a credit card, and I’ve been doing this for 15 years,” said Gary Leff, who runs the travel and points blog View From the Wing. Chase has approved tens of thousands of applications for the card, said spokeswoman Lauren Francis. Most of the customers are millennials, who typically shun credit cards and are not usually a target for high-fee, ultra-premium plastic. The demand has been so high that Chase ran out of the alloy, whose composition is a trade secret. Customers are being issued temporary plastic cards. “We quickly ordered more, but because they are handcrafted, they take more time to make,” said Lisa Walker, general manager of Chase’s Sapphire credit card program. Credit cards with high fees but generous rewards are aimed at well-to-do customers who spend and travel extensively. The market has long been dominated by American Express with its Platinum Card. So why is the Chase card so hot? Chase offers a 100,000-point sign-up bonus if the customer meets certain spending targets. Those points can be worth up to $1,500 in travel rewards. They can also be converted to hotel or airline points that could secure, oh, a dreamy hotel suite in the Maldives or a first-class ticket for a honeymoon. The card also comes with a $300 annual credit toward travel, which effectively makes the annual fee $150. It has a generous points-earning program, with triple points on travel and dining, and gives access to airport lounges. “It’s one of the best offers I’ve ever seen. With the amount of travel and dining we do, I saw it as a worthwhile card to get,” Novich said. The card’s metal composition is also clearly part of the appeal. Only a handful of other credit cards are metal, including the American Express Centurion Card, commonly known as the AmEx “black card,” which is typically available only to millionaires, billionaires and celebrities. Kayla Kania, 33, a manager at an accounting firm from Rockville, Maryland, proudly posted a picture of her new Chase card on Instagram and said she has received compliments about it from cashiers and a co-worker. “The metal part of it, people get excited about it. It’s weird,” she said. She added: “It’s such a conversation piece.” Tags Credit Card Fee Card Alloy American Express Plastic Featured Businesses The Schwalbach Agency | Allstate Agent | Omaha 20330 Veterans Dr 5, Elkhorn, NE 68022 402-206-2170 Currently Open Dr. Josh Evans 8901 Indian Hills Dr, Omaha , NE 68114 402-397-7057 Currently Open Marian High School | Girls Catholic High School | Omaha 7400 Military Ave, Omaha, NE 68134 402-571-2618 Currently Open Events Heartland Properties - Bruce Guill 535 W Bdwy, Ste 100, Council Bluffs, IA 51503 712-388-2249 Patty's Pub | Bar and Grill | Lincoln NE 311 N Cotner Blvd, Lincoln, NE 68505 402-467-4471 Currently Open Best Black Friday Ads & Deals | Sales | Omaha World-Herald Black Friday Ad Headquarters 1314 Douglas St., Omaha, NE 68102 Currently Open World-Herald 150 Stocks In case you missed it Cabela's didn't meet financial goals in 2015, but executives still collected big bonuses Something to be thankful for this year: A cheaper Turkey feast Two metro-area Shopkos to close Historic tax credits — $24 million for Nebraska projects since 2015 — help drive revival near downtown Omaha Headache for farmers as they get less cash for more crops Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway Berkshire Hathaway buying stakes in several major airlines Replay: Nov. 15 Warren Watch chat Warren Buffett Watch: Mining the diamond expertise of Borsheims CEO Tweets by @OWHmoney loading...

After a routine State Council meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on Monday, the cabinet said it had decided to improve weak links in the economy by accelerating key infrastructure projects and encouraging private investment. Private investment proving to be Chinese economy’s Achilles’ heel To Goldman, it was a signal of renewed easing. The firm’s economists, led by Yu Song and MK Tang, wrote in a note dated September 6 that the statement “sent out a clear signal of another round of policy loosening”. Meanwhile at JPMorgan, economists led by Grace Ng and Haibin Zhu, said two days later that the policy stance “will unlikely become more expansionary”. The different views between the two leading investment banks reflect the growing difficulty in forecasting the pace and degree of China’s policy moves, despite Beijing’s general pro-growth position. China has said repeatedly that it will maintain prudent monetary policy and proactive fiscal policy, but the general statements are losing relevance in a rapidly evolving economy which is forcing observers to try to squeeze meaning out bureaucratic jargon. For Goldman Sachs’ China economists, which also include Zhennan Li and Maggie Wei, the 1,070-character statement on Monday, together with Beijing’s decision to send “inspection teams” to whip local cadres into line on investment, “are important signals that the government intends to loosen cyclical policy for the second time this year”. The initial round was in the first quarter when Chinese banks pumped in an unprecedented amount of credit to aid growth. China’s state agencies struggle to coordinate policies in bid to boost slowing growth However, their counterparts at JPMorgan, including Marvin Chen, said the message from Monday’s meeting was merely to dispel concern that fiscal support would dissipate. “The government … is aiming to maintain largely stable fiscal support for the rest of the year, though the policy stance will unlikely become more expansionary in our view,” they wrote. But one thing is clear: the central government is ditching big-bang measures such as all-out fiscal stimulus, opting for more targeted economic management. For instance, the central bank has steered away from headline-grabbing cuts to interest rates and bank reserve ratios, preferring instead to make lower-profile day-to-day moves in the interbank market to influence interest rates and available funding. Chinese consumer jitters point to rocky economic ride ahead And it could just be working. After a slew of weak economic indicators from investment to bank lending in July, the purchasing managers’ index, a measure of factory activity, surged to a near two-year high in August, while imports also recorded the first monthly growth in August since October 2014, reflecting improved domestic demand.

“No warning can save people determined to grow suddenly rich” – Lord Overstone Home Articles Authors Email Groups Search About Us HOME / Articles / Michael Noonan / Gold And Silver Are Money. Everything Else Is Debt... Gold And Silver Are Money. Everything Else Is Debt. Globalist's Biggest Scam By: Michael Noonan | Sat, Sep 10, 2016 Share Print Email Last week, in "Fiat 'Dollar' Says Gold And Silver Will Struggle," we said the following: [See 4th paragraph] Money does not exist in this country. In fact, money does not exist anywhere in the world. What is money? So few people know, and many who profess to know do not. Money is a commodity with a recognized value. Gold and silver remain the last known standard of real money. Remember J P Morgan's famous words: "Gold is money. Everything else is credit." The globalists, through their creation of the Federal Reserve, have sold the biggest lie ever to the world and continue to get away with it. People everywhere believe the fiat-created Federal Reserve Note, falsely called the "dollar," is actually a monetary dollar. We have often stated how Federal Reserve Notes are evidences of debt issued by the Fed. We also always add that debt is not and can never be money, yet almost every American wrongly believes debt is money because they believe the Fed "dollar" is money. Only gold and silver are money! Gold and silver each are a commodity. They have universal recognition and acceptance. Their value is determined by the market by what people choose to accept as payment for goods and services offered. By contrast, the Fed "dollar" is not money. It is a currency. A currency represents the actual money. In today's world, there is no currency that represents actual money. Fiat is imaginary. It does not exist except in one's mind. Yet, around the world, everyone's imagination believes their local currency is money. Only gold and silver are money! If you go to a restaurant and use valet parking, you receive a stub to reclaim your car by the valet at the end of dinner. The ticket stub is not the car, it represents the car to be "redeemed" upon presentation. There is no currency in the world that represents money, and no currency can be redeemed for money. Always remember, Only gold and silver are money! This is a very simple truth, yet few accept it as truth. Almost everyone is too willing to believe that imaginary currencies are real money. For as long as most of the world is willing to accept this false premise, the globalists will always rule the masses much like sheep being led to financial slaughter. How do most people measure the value of gold and silver? By their imaginary currency. Always remember, every currency is imaginary because it is backed by nothing. Any currency's "value" is dictated determined by the source, the central bank issuing the imaginary money currency. When you understand the basic difference between money and currency, you will fully understand the globalist's massive "money" Ponzi scheme which is aided and abetted by every government guilty of perpetrating the fraud, and make no mistake, the fraud is on you. The only way to measure of the value of gold and silver is by the daily fluctuating number of fiats [of any country's issuance] required to buy either metal. The value of gold and silver do not go up and down. It is the number of fiats that increases or decreases that determines how gold and silver are "priced" on any given day. If people do not understand the basics, they will continue to believe that debt is money. The two are not and can never be interchangeable. In a Venn diagram, money and debt can never intersect for they have nothing in common. By contrast, because currencies are actual debt, not only do they intersect, [as we show in this simple diagram], they are concurrent overlaying circles, one and the same. If a currency is a promise to pay, what is the promise you receive? None, zip, nada. All you can get is more of the same in different denominations. Currencies are more akin to the car game, Old Maid, where one wants to avoid being the last holder of the queen card designated as the Old Maid. The American public will be in for the financial shock of their lives when they wake up one day and discover what they own are nothing more than Old Maids that have been devalued by 30%, 40%, maybe even 50%. The Old Maids will be the fiat Federal Reserve Note, falsely know as a "dollar," but they will have declined in value relative to gold and silver, aka real money. If it takes 1,300 fiat Federal Reserve Notes to purchase an ounce of gold, and one day, overnight, gold is revalued so that it takes 5,000 fiat Federal Reserve Notes to purchase the same one ounce of gold, it is not the ounce of gold that has changed. Instead, the number of fiats has been devalued, worth much less than the Federal Reserve once said they were worth which is why more and more will be required to buy the unchanged ounce of gold, and silver. If you own an ounce of gold, you can exchange to for 1,300 Federal Reserve fiat Notes by today's measure. When the fiat is devalued overnight, your ounce of gold will then be able to be exchanged to 5,000 fiat Notes. In other words, your wealth effect will have been preserved. This is why you want to buy and hold gold and silver. All governments have sold out their citizens to the globalist's fiat Ponzi scheme. Earlier, we posted an article, "Anything & Everything Goes – The Corrupt and Deranged Governance of America," because we like the George Orwell quote: "The further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it." The globalists hate the truth, and they do everything possible to keep the truth suppressed. Knowing the difference between money and currency is a perfect example. Remember, the money currency you hold in any bank is even more "unreal" than the paper currency that you may still think is money, because anything digitalized is pure fiction. If you have a family, they are real. If you have a digitalized family, they do not exist, except in your mind, just like currency. If you want money and want to survive the massive economic failure that is destined to come, buy and hold gold and silver. The world has not been awash in debt more than it is now and that mushrooming debt cannot be sustained What's in your wallet? For the moment, we are in the calm of the proverbial eye of the largest hurricane ever, and it is the calm before the inescapable storm that will be more financially destructive than the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. If you fail to understand what money is vs what currency is, you remain at risk. The trend in gold has turned up, and it is at the beginning of the next phase. Timing has been difficult because it is impossible to apply reason to fiction, that which is unreasonable. The only rational way to respond to the globalist fiction being peddled around the world is to be prepared. The best way to be prepared, in terms of gold and silver, is to own it, for one day, the price will be off the charts, as it were. What stands out in the daily chart is what appears to be obscured and that is the last two separate massive sell days of thousands of gold contracts by the BIS, trying to punish those who choose to take their own path and not be a lemming to be led over the financial cliff that lies ahead. In the past, the massive manipulated sell days stood out on a chart. Now, it is more like trying to find Waldo. Truth and the price of gold will ultimately prevail. The two up slanting lines, one for volume, the other for price, demonstrate how the market advertises its intent. When the highest volume in a rally occurs at the high, it usually is a disguised show from sellers overtaking buyers, and a correction will follow. Silver is seemingly bidding its time more than gold, but it still is outperforming gold, and we expect that will continue. It will be interesting to see if the current bullish spacing will hold while silver seems to struggle out of its sideways bottoming process. Bullish spacing occurs when the last swing low is above the high of the last swing high, an indication that buyers are not waiting to see how the market will retest that last swing high. It is unusual to appear in what is considered a relatively weak market. So far, there has been no sign that the current near-term decline has ended.     Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

For as long as most of the world is willing to accept this false premise, the globalists will always rule the masses much like sheep being led to financialslaughter. How do most people measure the value of gold and silver? By their imaginary currency. Always remember, every currency is imaginary because it is backed by nothing. Any currency's "value" is dictateddetermined by the source, the central bank issuing the imaginary moneycurrency. When you understand the basic difference between money and currency, you will fully understand the globalist's massive "money" Ponzi scheme which is aided and abetted by every government guilty of perpetrating the fraud, and make no mistake, the fraud is on you. The only way to measure of the value of gold and silver is by the daily fluctuating number of fiats [of any country's issuance] required to buy either metal. The value of gold and silver do not go up and down. It is the number of fiats that increases or decreases that determines how gold and silver are "priced" on any given day. If people do not understand the basics, they will continue to believe that debt is money. The two are not and can never be interchangeable. In a Venn diagram, money and debt can never intersect for they have nothing in common. By contrast, because currencies are actual debt, not only do they intersect, [as we show in this simple diagram], they are concurrent overlaying circles, one and the same. If a currency is a promise to pay, what is the promise you receive? None, zip, nada. All you can get is more of the same in different denominations. Currencies are more akin to the car game, Old Maid, where one wants to avoid being the last holder of the queen card designated as the Old Maid. The American public will be in for the financial shock of their lives when they wake up one day and discover what they own are nothing more than Old Maids that have been devalued by 30%, 40%, maybe even 50%. The Old Maids will be the fiat Federal Reserve Note, falsely know as a "dollar," but they will have declined in valuerelative to gold and silver,aka real money. If it takes 1,300 fiat Federal Reserve Notes to purchase an ounce of gold, and one day, overnight, gold isrevaluedso that it takes 5,000 fiat Federal Reserve Notes to purchasethe same one ounce of gold, it is not the ounce of gold that has changed. Instead, the number of fiats has been devalued, worth much less than the Federal Reserve once said they were worth which is why more and more will be required to buy the unchanged ounce of gold, and silver. If you own an ounce of gold, you can exchange to for 1,300 Federal Reserve fiat Notes by today's measure. When the fiat is devalued overnight, your ounce of gold will then be able to be exchanged to 5,000 fiat Notes. In other words, your wealth effect will have been preserved. Thisis why you want to buy and hold gold and silver. All governments have sold out their citizens to the globalist's fiat Ponzi scheme. Earlier, we posted an article,"Anything & Everything Goes - The Corrupt and Deranged Governance of America,"because we like the George Orwell quote: “The further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.” The globalists hate the truth, and they do everything possible to keep the truth suppressed. Knowing the difference between money and currency is a perfect example. Remember, the moneycurrency you hold in any bank is even more "unreal" than the paper currency that you may still think is money, because anything digitalized is pure fiction. If you have a family, they are real. If you have a digitalized family, they do not exist, except in your mind, just like currency. If you want money and want to survive the massive economic failure that is destined to come, buy and hold gold and silver. The world has not been awash in debt more than it is now and that mushrooming debt cannot be sustained What's in your wallet? For the moment, we are in the calm of the proverbial eye of the largest hurricane ever, and it is the calm before the inescapable storm that will be more financially destructive than the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. If you fail to understand what money is vs what currency is, you remain at risk. The trend in gold has turned up, and it is at the beginning of the next phase. Timing has been difficult because it is impossible to apply reason to fiction, that which is unreasonable. The only rational way to respond to the globalist fiction being peddled around the world is to be prepared. The best way to be prepared, in terms of gold and silver, is to own it, for one day, the price will be off the charts, as it were. What stands out in the daily chart is what appears to be obscured and that is the last two separate massive sell days of thousands of gold contracts by the BIS, trying to punish those who choose to take their own path and not be a lemming to be led over the financial cliff that lies ahead. In the past, the massive manipulated sell days stood out on a chart. Now, it is more like trying to find Waldo. Truth and the price of gold will ultimately prevail. The two up slanting lines, one for volume, the other for price, demonstrate how the market advertises its intent. When the highest volume in a rally occurs at the high, it usually is a disguised show from sellers overtaking buyers, and a correction will follow. Silver is seemingly bidding its time more than gold, but it still is outperforming gold, and we expect that will continue. It will be interesting to see if the current bullish spacing will hold while silver seems to struggle out of its sideways bottoming process. Bullish spacing occurs when the last swing low is above the high of the last swing high, an indication that buyers are not waiting to see how the market will retest that last swing high. It is unusual to appear in what is considered a relatively weak market. So far, there has been no sign that the current near-term decline has ended.

Checking for new content Loading new content Democracy Now! HOME TOPICS DONATE Fri Sep 9, 2016 Who Is Funding the Dakota Access Pipeline? Bank of America, HSBC, UBS, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo Watch Listen 09m 32s We continue our conversation Food & Water Watch’s Hugh MacMillan about his new investigation that reveals the dozens of financial institutions that are bankrolling the Dakota Access pipeline, including Bank of America, HSBC, UBS, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase. "They are banking on this company and banking on being able to drill and frack for the oil to send through the pipeline over the coming decades," MacMillan says. "So they’re providing the capital for the construction of this pipeline." AMY GOODMAN: Juan, in a moment we’re going to be talking about the Attica prison uprising, but right now we’re going to be looking at the banks and who is funding the $3.8 billion pipeline, the Dakota Access pipeline. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, we’ll continue to—on Wednesday in Minneapolis—what we want to do is continue to cover the coverage of the standoff at Standing Rock over the $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline with a look at who is profiting off of it. On Wednesday in Minneapolis, dozens protested at U.S. Bank Plaza, demanding U.S. Bank stop funding the pipeline. According to an investigation published by LittleSis, U.S. Bank has extended a $175 million credit line to Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the pipeline. AMY GOODMAN: Meanwhile, Saturday was the first day of a two-week call for actions against the financial institutions that are bankrolling the Dakota Access pipeline project. We turn to Part 2 of our conversation with Hugh MacMillan, a senior researcher with Food & Water Watch whose new investigation reveals the dozens of financial institutions that are bankrolling what’s called DAPL, the Dakota Access pipeline. I began by asking Hugh what’s most important to understand about the corporate structure of the pipeline company. HUGH MACMILLAN: Dakota Access, LLC, is a joint venture of Phillips 66 and a joint venture of two members of the Energy Transfer family—Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics. Enbridge and Marathon Oil have bought into this, this joint venture. Together, they now have about a 37 percent stake in the pipeline, in the Dakota Access pipeline. AMY GOODMAN: How are the banks involved? HUGH MACMILLAN: Well, that’s—they are banking on this company and banking on being able to drill and frack for the oil to send through the pipeline over the coming decades. So they’re providing the capital for the construction of this pipeline. AMY GOODMAN: And explain what the banks are. Which banks are they? And how are they involved? HUGH MACMILLAN: Well, I’ve got a list of the 17 banks that are specifically providing financing for this project. And it’s also coupled together with a Energy Transfer—Energy Transfer Partner project to convert an existing pipeline that would connect to the south end of the Dakota Access pipeline and run oil all the way down to the Gulf Coast, where there are refineries and also export infrastructure. AMY GOODMAN: Can you tell us that list of 17 banks? HUGH MACMILLAN: I can. Citibank is the bank that’s been running the books on the project, and that’s the bank that beat the bushes and got other banks to join in. So, we have Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Mizuho Bank, TD Securities, ABN AMRO Capital, DNB First Bank—and that’s actually a bank based in Philly; it’s not the DNB Bank based in Norway, which is actually provided several hundred million to the Energy Transfer family separately—and ICBC London, SMBC Nikko Securities and Société Générale. AMY GOODMAN: Now, it’s Citibank—is that right?—that’s running the books, as the report points out, for Energy Transfer and Sunoco Logistics, which own the Dakota Access pipeline? HUGH MACMILLAN: That’s right, by and large. So they have the largest share, and they’ve spearheaded the effort. So, what we published in LittleSis was the 30-plus banks that have provided general financing for Sunoco Logistics and Energy Transfer Partners. Through working with Rainforest Action Network, we were able to—who has access to Bloomberg Terminal, we were able to determine these 17 banks that I just listed, who are providing the direct financing for the Dakota Access project and, in addition, for an Energy Transfer Partners project to extend this pipeline on down to Texas. So, collectively, this pipeline would run from near the Canadian border on down to the Gulf Coast of Texas over 1,800 miles. AMY GOODMAN: I was just talking to an oil trucker in the plane back from North Dakota, and he trucks from the Bakken fields to other areas of North Dakota, just locally. And he said it is stunning to see the drop in demand for oil just in this past year. He has been trucking for four years. What about this decline in demand and what this will mean? HUGH MACMILLAN: Well, you know, if you ask Morgan Stanley, they said a year ago that the oil producers are getting into prison shape—and without irony. So, you know, this is a long-term—these are long-term investments from the banks. There’s fully the—they fully expect the United States to maximize its production of oil and gas through widespread fracking. AMY GOODMAN: What do you mean, "prison shape"? HUGH MACMILLAN: Well, I have a note here. They explain that "Some prisoners"—and I quote—"contrive clever equipment in workouts that result in fitness levels that surpass the traditional gym shape." And so they’re speaking in—they’re drawing an analogy to prisoners getting in good shape, drawing an analogy from that to oil and gas companies, fracking companies, learning how to do things more cheaply and more efficiently. AMY GOODMAN: So, Hugh MacMillan, as we wrap up, what do you think is most important for people to understand about the corporate structure of the company, Dakota Access pipeline, that is building the Dakota Access pipeline? HUGH MACMILLAN: Well, I think it’s important to see the forces behind this particular pipeline as the same forces behind numerous other pipelines across the country, both for—both to support fracking for tight oil as well as fracking for shale gas, all toward maximizing production of oil and gas, when the science is clear that we need to maximize what we keep in the ground. Our current policy has not made that switch. And if you look at the Department of Energy’s Quadrennial Technology Review published a year ago, you’ll see, under clean energy technologies, permeability manipulation is included, along with improved understanding of well integrity and improved understanding of injections and how they’re causing earthquakes, such as occurred over the weekend. The Quadrennial— AMY GOODMAN: In Oklahoma. HUGH MACMILLAN: That’s right, in Oklahoma. The Quadrennial Technology Review speaks of a future mastery of the subsurface toward maximizing production. AMY GOODMAN: Hugh MacMillan, senior researcher with Food & Water Watch. His new investigation reveals the dozens of financial institutions that are bankrolling the Dakota Access pipeline.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 09, 2016 9:45am   Comments Share: Related CHK Benzinga's Top Upgrades 20 Biggest Mid-Day Gainers For Thursday Chesapeake Energy sells Utica acreage, wells to Ohio company (Seeking Alpha) Citing an improved financial position and maintained strong operations, Wunderlich has upgraded Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE: CHK) to Buy from Hold and raised its target by $4 to $10. "We believe as the company continues this process, it can exhibit production growth, higher cash flows and multiple expansion. In fact, we believe there are multiple potential catalysts for CHK that can drive its stock higher," analyst Jason Wangler wrote in a note. Debt Concerns And Tailwinds Further, the ongoing better commodity environment and financial markets provide further tailwinds to the company's operations. Chesapeake updated commentary shows forecasted annual production growth of 5–15 percent from 2016–2020. Related Link: Director Dunham Buys 350,000 Shares Of Chesapeake Energy At $6.07/Shares -Form 4 Wangler expects Chesapeake is likely to see an inflection point in production mid-2017, bringing back the company to growth path while still spending at a prudent level. In addition, the planned asset divestitures and the ongoing tender offer for multiple tranches of debt should not just aid in reducing the overall debt level, but should also cut further into its 2017 maturities. Chesapeake has been able to lower its potential 2017 debt from $2.2 billion in 2015 to an estimated $660 million at this point in time. Currently, Chesapeake has about $3.9 billion in liquidity between cash-on-hand and its credit facility, which can help fund any outspend. "We believe CHK's balance sheet should improve further with the results from its ongoing tender offers that should be finalized next week and look for even more incremental data from its newly scheduled analyst day next month, which could further define upcoming opportunities," Wangler added. Looking Forward The analyst's current per share estimates are $(0.30) for 2016 and $0.57 for 2017. Wangler sees cash flow per share of $1.15 for 2016 and $1.87 for 2017. Furthermore, he expects Chesapeake to generate positive cash flows of around $1.0 billion in 2016, cash flow negative by about $500 million in 2017 and cash flow neutrality in 2018. Shares of Chesapeake rose 13.66 percent Thursday to close trading at $7.74. In the pre-market hours on Friday, they fell 1.94 percent to $7.59. Within 10 minutes of the regular trading session, Chesapeake was seen at $7.69, down 0.65 percent on the day. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

MARKET COMMENTS Sep E-mini S&Ps (ESU16 -0.30%) this morning are down -5.50 points (-0.25%). Thursday's closes: S&P 500 -0.22%, Dow Jones -0.25%, Nasdaq -0.58%. The S&P 500 on Thursday closed lower on disappointment that the ECB did not expand stimulus measures at its policy meeting. Stocks recovered from their worst levels as energy producer stocks rallied after crude oil surged +4.66% to a 1-week high. Dec 10-year T-notes (ZNZ16 -0.10%) this morning are down -3 ticks. Thursday's closes: TYZ6 -20.50, FVZ6 -11.50. Dec T-notes on Thursday closed lower on the unexpected drop in U.S. weekly jobless claims to a 7-week low and on disappointment that the ECB did not expand QE. There were also increased inflation expectations after the 10-year T-note breakeven inflation rate rose to a 2-1/2 month high. The dollar index (DXY00 -0.04%) this morning is up +0.020 (+0.02%). EUR/USD (^EURUSD) is up +0.0003 (+0.03%). USD/JPY (^USDJPY) is up +0.19 (+0.19%). Thursday's closes: Dollar index +0.071 (+0.07%), EUR/USD +0.0021 (+0.19%), USD/JPY +0.75 (+0.74%). The dollar index on Thursday recovered from a 2-week low and closed higher on signs of U.S. labor market strength that may prompt the Fed to raise interest rates after U.S. weekly jobless claims unexpectedly fell to a 7-week low. Another hawkish factor for Fed policy was the increase in the 10-year inflation breakeven rate to a 2-1/2 month high due to the sharp +4.66% rally in oil prices. The dollar was undercut by the rally in EUR/USD to a 2-week high after the ECB refrained from addtional stimulus measures at its policy meeting. Oct crude oil (CLV16 -1.24%) this morning is down -66 cents (-1.39%) and Oct gasoline (RBV16 -1.98%) is down -0.0324 (-2.29%). Thursday's closes: CLV6 +2.12 (+4.66%), RBV6 +0.0701 (+5.21%). Oct crude oil and gasoline on Thursday rallied to 1-week highs and closed sharply higher. Crude oil prices were boosted by the -14.51 million bbl plunge in EIA crude inventories to a 6-1/2 month low (the biggest decline since Jan 1999) and the -4.21 million bbl decline in EIA gasoline stockpiles to an 8-1/4 month low, more than expectations of -750,000 bbl.

The offering of the New Notes was upsized from an originally announced amount of $450 million. AMD also announced the pricing of a public offering of shares of its common stock (the "Shares") of $600 million at a price of $6.00 per share. AMD expects the transactions to close on or around Sept. 14, 2016, subject to customary closing conditions. AMD also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 15 million additional Shares at the public offering price and up to $105 million principal amount of additional New Notes. AMD estimates that the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Shares and the New Notes (the "Net Proceeds") will be approximately $1.26 billion after deducting the underwriters' discounts and estimated offering expenses. The New Notes will be unsecured, unsubordinated obligations of AMD, and interest will be payable semi-annually at a rate of 2.125% per year. The initial conversion rate of the New Notes is 125.0031 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the New Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $8.00 per share). Upon conversion, AMD will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock of AMD or a combination of cash and shares of common stock of AMD, at its election. AMD intends to use the Net Proceeds received from the offerings to repay its borrowings under its credit facility and/or to purchase its outstanding senior notes. After the completion of a tender offer for its outstanding senior notes, AMD has the option, but not the obligation, to call any and all of the untendered 7.75% Senior Notes due 2020 with any remaining net proceeds.

In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, trends in our businesses, prospective services, future performance or financial results and the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings. We claim the protection afforded by the safe harbor for forward-looking statements provided by the PSLRA. These statements are only predictions based on our current expectations and projections about future events.  Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements to differ materially from the results contained in the forward-looking statements.  Risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to vary materially, some of which are described within the forward-looking statements, include, among others: certain risks and uncertainties associated with the proposed acquisition of Valence Health, including: revenues of Valence Health before and after the merger may be less than expected, and expected results of Evolent may not be impacted as anticipated; uncertainties related to the timing of the receipt of required regulatory approvals for the merger; the ability of Evolent and Valence Health to satisfy the closing conditions of the merger; the occurrence of any change that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement; our ability to implement integration plans for the merger and to recognize the anticipated growth, benefits, cost savings and synergies of the merger; the risks that the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement disrupt current plans and operations and the potential difficulties in retention of any members of senior management of Valence Health and any other key employees that Evolent is interested in retaining after the closing of the merger; the limitations placed on the ability of Evolent and Valence Health to operate their respective businesses by the merger agreement; the effect of the announcement of the merger on Evolent's and Valence Health's business relationships, customers, suppliers, other partners, standing with regulators, operating results and businesses generally; the amount of any costs, fees, expenses, impairments and charges related to the merger; and the market price for our Class A common stock potentially being affected, following the merger, by factors that historically have not affected the market price for our Class A common stock; the structural change in the market for health care in the United States; our ability to effectively manage our growth; the significant portion of revenue we derive from our largest partners; our ability to offer new and innovative products and services; the growth and success of our partners, which is difficult to predict and is subject to factors outside of our control, including premium pricing reductions and the ability to control and, if necessary, reduce health care costs; our ability to attract new partners; our ability to recover the significant upfront costs in our partner relationships; our ability to estimate the size of our target market; our ability to maintain and enhance our reputation and brand recognition; consolidation in the health care industry; competition which could limit our ability to maintain or expand market share within our industry; our ability to partner with providers due to exclusivity provisions in our contracts; uncertainty in the health care regulatory framework; restrictions and penalties as a result of privacy and data protection laws; adequate protection of our intellectual property; any alleged infringement, misappropriation or violation of third-party proprietary rights; our use of "open source" software; our ability to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information; our reliance on third parties; our ability to use, disclose, de-identify or license data and to integrate third-party technologies; data loss or corruption due to failures or errors in our systems and service disruptions at our data centers; breaches or failures of our security measures; our reliance on Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers, other third parties and our own systems for providing services to our users; our dependency on our key personnel, and our ability to attract, hire, integrate and retain key personnel; risks related to future acquisition opportunities; the risk of potential future goodwill impairment on our results of operations; our future indebtedness and our ability to obtain additional financing; our ability to achieve profitability in the future; the requirements of being a public company; our adjusted results may not be representative of our future performance; the risk of potential future litigation; our ability to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting; our holding company structure and dependence on distributions from Evolent Health LLC; our obligations to make payments to certain of our pre-IPO investors for certain tax benefits we may claim in the future; our ability to utilize benefits under the tax receivables agreement; our ability to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that we currently expect to result from future exchanges of Class B common units of Evolent Health LLC for our Class A common stock, and to utilize certain tax attributes of Evolent Health Holdings and an affiliate of TPG; distributions that Evolent Health LLC will be required to make to us and to the other members of Evolent Health LLC; our obligations to make payments under the tax receivables agreement that may be accelerated or may exceed the tax benefits we realize; different interests among our pre-IPO investors, or between us and our pre-IPO investors; the terms of agreements between us and certain of our pre-IPO investors; our exemption from certain corporate governance requirements due to our status as a "controlled company" within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules; the potential volatility of our Class A common stock price; the potential decline of our Class A common stock price if a substantial number of shares become available for sale or if a large number of Class B common units is exchanged for shares of Class A common stock; provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws and provisions of Delaware law that discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of us; the ability of certain of our investors to compete with us without restrictions; provisions in our certificate of incorporation which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees; our intention not to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock; and our status as an "emerging growth company." The risks included here are not exhaustive.  Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements.  Our 2015 Form 10-K and other documents filed with the SEC include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors. Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.

(Ryan Remiorz/THE CANADIAN PRESS) Sears Canada posted a net loss of $91.6-million, or 90 cents per share, for the second quarter ended July 30, compared with a profit of $13.5-million, or 13 cents per share, a year earlier. (Ryan Remiorz/THE CANADIAN PRESS) Sears Canada swings to loss as sales tumble 15.6% Add to ... Reuters Published Wednesday, Sep. 07, 2016 7:28AM EDT Last updated Wednesday, Sep. 07, 2016 11:03AM EDT Comments AA Department store operator Sears Canada Inc reported a quarterly loss, compared with a year-earlier profit, hurt by a 15.6 per cent fall in sales. The company said same-store sales fell 5.5 per cent as traffic for big-ticket items such as major appliances fell due to termination of a credit card agreement and lower-than-expected sales of new merchandise launched in spring. Bank of Nova Scotia said in October it would buy JPMorgan & Chase Co’s Canadian credit card portfolio associated with Sears Canada. Sears Canada, hit by increasing competition from U.S. retail giants such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, has been shutting down stores and cutting jobs. The company said it cut $128-million in costs for the first half of this year and said it was planning cost cuts at the higher end of its previously announced $127-million-$155-million forecast. Sears Canada posted a net loss of $91.6-million, or 90 cents per share, for the second quarter ended July 30, compared with a profit of $13.5-million, or 13 cents per share, a year earlier. The year-earlier quarter included a gain of $67.2-million as a result of sale-and-leaseback transactions. Revenue fell to $648.5-million from $768.8-million.

Upon the receipt of the required consents to approve the Proposed Amendments, AMD will enter into a supplemental indenture to amend the terms of the indenture governing the 7.75% Notes.

That’s pushing traders to bet on construction companies. An index tracking firms from France’s Vinci SA to Germany’s HeidelbergCement AG has rallied 20 percent since a low in June, reaching an almost nine-year high and posting one of the biggest gains among Stoxx Europe 600 Index industries. JPMorgan Asset Management and BNP Paribas SA are among those that have recently raised the prospect of more fiscal stimulus. Since the ECB started its bond-buying program, the economy has remained subdued, with euro-zone inflation failing to pick up despite record-low interest rates. That’s left the door open to speculation about what else could be done. Were European nations to increase infrastructure spending, builders would be among the companies benefiting the most, according to NN Investment Partners’ Patrick Moonen, who raised the sector to overweight from neutral at the beginning of August. “The market is absolutely anticipating this move,” said Moonen, who helps oversee about $200 billion as a multi-asset strategist at NN Investment Partners in The Hague. “Infrastructure spending is the most efficient way to do fiscal spending. Those industries, companies that have an activity in infrastructure -- for example building materials and industrial companies -- will clearly benefit.” ECB President Mario Draghi said on Thursday that fiscal policies should also support the economy and that Germany has room to do more. The central bank, which kept its policy unchanged, lowered its euro-area growth forecasts for 2017 and 2018, while raising it for 2016. Statements to influence government spending are about the only thing the ECB can do, as the authority lies with the national Treasuries and the European Commission, said Jamie Murray, an economist with Bloomberg Intelligence. Globally, the trend is also toward an increase in public investments, with both U.S. presidential candidates promoting such plans, while Japanese lawmakers recently approved a $46 billion infrastructure program. In the U.K., Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond is expected to ramp it up, and Murray said Germany could well take the lead in the region’s efforts. “Its spill-over to the rest of the euro economy would be helpful,” Murray said in a telephone interview, referring to Germany. “They’re the only ones who can afford it, and they have chronically high savings rate, so if the government opens up the tap it would help unwind the imbalances impeding the euro-area recovery.” William Hobbs, head of investment strategy at the wealth-management unit of Barclays Plc in London, said fiscal stimulus is already reflected in stock prices and further gains are unlikely. The Stoxx 600 gauge of construction companies trades at 17.6 times estimated earnings, compared with 15.2 for the benchmark index. “The purse strings have already been loosened and the scope for any meaningful, additional fiscal effort in Europe has limitations,” Hobbs said. “We would stay clear of construction companies as all this optimism has been priced in.” NN Investment Partners’ Moonen doesn’t share the opinion and says builders have further to rally. He expects a more expansive fiscal policy will also boost banking and consumer-related shares. Companies that are the most sensitive to the economic cycle have just had their best two-month showing since 2012 relative to defensive stocks. “We see a shift in policy makers’ minds, and that’s why we started to increase our exposure towards cyclical sectors,” Moonen said. Stocks will continue their advance as “data show that indeed something is changing with fiscal policy, that it’s not just hope but a reality.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.
