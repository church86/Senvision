Morgan says there is only one place to be in 2016 by Sarah Butcher 21 October 2016 If you’re not working here, bad luck. http://news.efinancialcareers.com/uk-en/263142/deutsche-banks-chart/ How it is on U.S. rates desks J.P. Morgan’s banking analysts have issued a new note updating their predictions on performance by bank and sector for 2016. There, they suggest there is only one place to be in 2016: fixed income trading at a U.S. bank. All else is dirge. You can see J.P. Morgan’s latest predictions for 2016 by bank and by division below. If J.P. Morgan’s right, only U.S. firms’ fixed income operations and investment banking divisions (IBD) will experience revenue growth this year. European banks are expected to see year-on-year revenue declines in every business area on average – although there should be bright spots in fixed income trading at BNP Paribas at SocGen. How can this be? J.P. Morgan’s analysts point to the more favourable business mix at U.S. firms. U.S. banks are more strongly geared to U.S. rates and credit markets, and these have had some of the highest activity so far this year.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Saturday, 22 October 2016 | MYT 6:00 AM Argentina's tech sector on the cusp of a boom, but obstacles remain No concerted push: There have been no targeted steps to bolster the sector since Macri's election. — Reuters NEW YORK:  Mauricio Macri's presidential election victory in November was a clear signal to Diego Saez Gil that it was time to move back to Argentina and take his growing "connected luggage" startup with him. By the time Macri took office the following month, Saez Gil was already staffing an office for his Bluesmart baggage company in Buenos Aires' Palermo neighborhood, on the way to hiring 21 software developers, designers and customer support personnel – more than double the staff at its headquarters in New York. "We started thinking about the talent we needed to scale the company, and at the same time we saw the new government," Saez Gil said in a telephone interview. "That was the catalyst to say Argentina seems a really good place to go." As he looks to grow his company, which produces luggage that automatically locks and can be tracked via a smart-phone app, Saez Gil said his home country offers the best mix of startup-friendly cost structure and a highly educated population with engineering skills. And when Macri removed long-standing currency controls, eased reserve and deposit requirements for overseas investors and cut a deal with its foreign creditors, effectively reopening international debt markets, Saez Gil was convinced Argentina would no longer scare off potential investors. Like other tech business leaders interviewed by Reuters, he was also attracted by the potential of the president's now-passed "entrepreneurs' law" allowing businesses to more easily be incorporated. Under pressure to turn around a sagging economy long reliant on commodities like beef and soybeans, Macri is hoping a nascent tech sector can provide a fresh source of growth. Raising investment in the tech sector to 1.5%  of gross domestic product is one of his government's key goals as it looks to boost production and employment. While pleased with the new government's first steps, Saez Gil and other Argentine business owners such as Martin Migoya, co-founder and chief technology officer of services provider Globant, say Argentina still lacks the kind of market liquidity and depth needed to list their shares there. Additionally, the country's size presents a problem. "Argentina is a good market, but it's not big enough to think about a multinational company just serving Argentina," Migoya told Reuters in a phone interview. "So by definition, entrepreneurs in Argentina need to think in a global way. That's not very common and we need to foster that." If Bluesmart eventually goes public, as Saez Gil hopes, the Nasdaq is a more likely venue than Buenos Aires' stock market. Local Argentine investors have a better handle on businesses like mining, agribusiness and utilities than tech, he said. That limited awareness is just one of several obstacles to tech expansion in Argentina. Business owners say that even under Macri's more business-friendly administration there are still many challenges that include stifling taxes and difficulty obtaining financing from banks. Near-shoring Nevertheless, in a development that could help more tech startups, a growing number of multinationals have in recent years outsourced thousands of positions to Latin America's third largest economy. Companies such as JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Accenture and Chevron Corp have shifted research, accounting and call centre jobs in English and Spanish to Argentina. The moves, most of which predate Macri's election win, take advantage of Argentina's relative abundance of bilingual college graduates. They have made it a hub for "near-shoring," in which companies outsource to Latin America rather than to distant locations like India and the Philippines. Chevron, for example, has for about a decade employed staffers in Argentina who provide accounting services and IT support for many of its affiliates in Latin America, the United States and the United Kingdom. JPMorgan last year opened its first Latin America-based global support hub in Argentina, months before Macri's election. The bank, which previously had only an investment banking operation there with around 140 employees, now has about 700 with some 100 in roles like software development, systems analysis and securities processing, the bank's senior country officer, Facundo Gomez Minujin, told Reuters. The outsourcing moves could foster a virtuous cycle creating "a large body of technically savvy and technically trained people," said Sramana Mitra, founder and CEO of One Million by One Million, a global support network that includes Hernan Kazah, co-founder of Argentine online auction house MercadoLibre Inc. Gomez Minujin said JPMorgan plans to hire nearly 400 more tech workers in the next year in similar roles to the initial 100, many of whom will serve US.operations and clients. Overall, Argentina's outsourcing, or "near-shoring" sector boasts 105,000-115,000 full-time equivalent positions (FTEs) in global services, according to industry tracker Everest Group. That makes it the leader in South America and only about 20,000 FTEs behind Latin America tech services leader Mexico. "Despite macroeconomic instability in recent years, Argentina continues to witness new center set-up activity," said Salil Dani, Everest Group's vice president of global sourcing. In the last 24 months, 12 new outsourcing service providers have opened there, matching Mexico and more than doubling the pace in much larger Brazil, Everest data shows, although still well behind India. They are attracted by Argentina's time zone and cheap currency, down more than 75% against the dollar since 2011. But many also rave about its workers' English and engineering skills. "Argentina is the best place in Latin America for setting up shop," said Dileepan Siva, chief revenue officer at digital commerce software provider Moovweb who has a long history working with tech companies like eBay Inc and Twitter Inc. Embracing tech Mentoring and networking groups such as Endeavor, started in Buenos Aires in 1997 by two Americans, have helped connect startups like Bluesmart's Saez Gil with those who own multinational companies, like MercadoLibre chief executive Marcos Galperin. Tech champions MercadoLibre and Globant as well as community listings firm OLX and travel site Despegar – all valued at more than US$1bil (RM4.1bil) – were the stars of the only session Macri led at the recent Argentina Business and Investment Forum organised by his government in Buenos Aires. Macri's embrace of the tech sector is not new. As mayor of Buenos Aires he created a technology district and awarded companies that opened or moved there a 10-year tax break. But there have been no targeted steps to bolster the sector since his election, and the government's most recent budget aims to cut funding for the Ministry of Science, Technology and Productive Innovation by more than 30%. "We're not expecting the effort in technology from Argentina to come entirely from the public sector," Finance Minister Alfonso Prat-Gay recently told Reuters in New York. "It’s about deregulation, opening up the conditions for local and foreign players to be involved. So I think it’s wrong to just look at the budget and conclude that our priorities are not there." —  Reuters You May Be Interested Closure of 106 bank branches due to rationalisation plans, says Deputy Finance Minister Weak ringgit to impact 5 sectors Best smartphones for the holidays Alibaba's founder to support 'mini Jack Ma' until university graduation Private-public partnerships in a connected world Rejuvenate yourself with American ginseng Others Also Read SWCorp: Recycling cages to remain despite low usage Tourists now prefer lodgings with Airbnb flavour, hoteliers told MRT fare starts at RM1 advertisement Latest News Google Play Music knows what you want to hear Guardians of the Galaxy video game revealed early Electric Jaguar SUV highlights auto industry's cross currents Warning!

The rise of the (truly awful) webcam job interview The News Journal 4:52 p.m. EDT October 22, 2016 Heidi Soltis-Berner (Photo: PROVIDED) The future of job interviews might horrify you. It horrified Jake Rosen. A recent graduate of UCLA, Rosen was applying to be a page at NBC when he learned he wouldn't be going to an office to talk to a human being about his skills. Instead, he interviewed by webcam, on a laptop. So Skype, right? Nope, nothing as personal as that. He recorded his answers and sent them back to a hiring manager at NBC for review at the company's convenience. It's the robo-interview, and it goes something like this. In the more humane experience, a hiring manager, who also isn't all that practiced in the art of digital video, delivers taped questions. Or, if it's truly Mr. Roboto, a question pops up on the screen. You have a limited amount of time to answer. You talk to your computer, record the responses, and send them back to the company. Sometimes there's a practice question to get prospective employees used to talking to a camera. Sometimes there isn't. Often, at the end, you have the chance to re-record your answers. For shy people, it may be a dream come true. No firm handshake needed, and sure, you smell fine. And wouldn't we all love the redo option after making up an answer and mumbling it, too? For everyone else, it's awkward at best. It's a pretty slick encounter, a little like FaceTime, except you're forced to stare at your big, nervous face as you wax on about why you want to work at the company. It feels more like performing for an invisible audience than having a conversation, because that's essentially what it is. Not used to being on camera, Rosen felt flustered from the first question, which colored the rest of his interview, he said. DELAWAREONLINE Official: Wilmington traffic signs exceeded trial period DELAWAREONLINE Christie's auctioning Delaware man's 'holy grail of wines' "I'm not a YouTube star, obviously," he said. "It's such a weird experience talking to a camera. It honestly was pretty horrible." Jamie Black, who suffered through the video interview experience for a job at a school, said it felt "more like a game show than an interview." For many of us, the experience will soon be unavoidable. The human-free video job interview is on the rise. HireVue, one of a handful of companies making video interview software, works with 600 large organizations, including Deloitte, JPMorgan Chase, Under Armour, and most of the major U.S. airlines. This year, the company will do 2.5 million interviews, up from 13,000 five years ago. Nearly 90 percent of those are "on demand" interviews, with nobody live at the other end. For a hiring manager, the draw of the video interview is mainly efficiency. "Companies want to get to know way more people," said Mark Newman, the founder of HireVue. A recruiter can only get through so many 30-minute conversations in a day. And that doesn't take into account time lost to scheduling or on bad candidates. With a video interview, human resources staff members only have to review the answers, and can do so on their own schedule, without having to travel for on-campus recruiting. Using HireVue, Hilton got its hiring cycle down to 4.5 days, almost 20 days shorter than the average interview process. All of this saves companies money. Cigna has cut travel expenses for recruiters from $1 million a year, in some cases, to under $100,000. For the job candidate, the benefit of robo-recruiting is convenience-and that's about it. Generally, a company will give an interviewee a day or two to complete the interview, which can happen anywhere. That might sound like another plus, but for Rosen it only added to his stress. "You start to think about things you wouldn't normally think about in interviews. I started thinking about my surroundings," Rosen said. "I had to find a blank wall to sit in front of. ... Should I put a bookshelf behind me? A plant?" Recruiters say they don't judge candidates on their performance, appearance, or locale. "Judging is an interesting word," said Heidi Soltis-Berner, the managing director for talent at Deloitte. "I would say the on-demand interview is truly for fact sharing." Other recruiters said they do evaluate people on their communication abilities and eye contact. Even if hiring managers are instructed not to make decisions on how well a potential new employee can perform in front of a camera (which is a bit hard to believe), the whole setup can be trying. "You just see yourself and a stopwatch ticking down," said Black, who said his answers often got cut off by the timer. If and when he has to do it again, Black said, he would practice in front of a mirror with a stopwatch before the interview. Rosen said it might help to have someone sit behind the computer, as the interview happens, so it's like talking to a person instead of a screen. Just look at the camera so your focus isn't off. The best advice might be to just relax. "It's OK to come across as uncomfortable in front of the camera, because everyone is," said Scott Mitchell, a recruiter for American Wedding Group, which uses video interviews to prescreen the 1,900 independent contractors it works with. "We all assume you're going to be uncomfortable. We're putting you in an uncomfortable position." The robo-interview hasn't replaced human interaction completely. Many companies use it as a replacement for first-round screening interviews, followed by more traditional one-on-ones. But for interviewees who would rather go back to the old way ... that's not happening. Organizations can look at more people, and a more diverse set of people, with the video interviews, and save money on top of that. "Candidates will generally say, 'I would have preferred an in-person interview to this,' but that's not the right comparison," HireVue's Newman said. "The alternative is no interview at all."

Ogg October 22, 2016 10:55 am EST Print Email Tweet The week of October 21 had quite a few developments in the market and in the oil patch, with West Texas Intermediate crude managing to close at $50.85. That is the third week in a row with crude oil ending above $50, and with rig counts still rising, maybe it is no surprise that Federal Reserve survey showed more positive views by energy executives. Investors are continuing to look for opportunities in the oil and gas sector. It is important to understand that many of these oil stocks have recovered handily from their lows. Some of these companies remain under extreme duress, while others are as much as 100% to 200% off of their panic-induced bottoms seen in late 2015 or early 2016. The week of October 21 brought several key analyst calls looking for handy upside in the oil and gas sector. 24/7 Wall St. tracks many of the analyst upgrades and downgrades to find new ideas each day and week, but keep in mind that there is no such thing as a free lunch in investing. Other positive issues have been seen in oil and gas, with rig counts now up 16 for the past 17 weeks. Banks are reporting that their exposure to risk for energy defaults has largely subsided. Even the credit ratings agencies have suggested that the worst of the bankruptcies are likely behind. Here are eight very positive analyst calls in the oil and gas sector for the week of October 21. Again, analysts are not always right and sometimes they just make the wrong assumptions. Continental Resources Inc. (NYSE: CLR) was raised to Overweight from Equal Weight with a $60 price target at Barclays on October 17. The prior closing price was $51.78, and Harold Hamm’s company ended the week at $52.85. The stock has a 52-week trading range of $13.94 to $55.07 and a consensus analyst price target of $56.22. Halliburton Co. (NYSE: HAL) was also chased up after earnings by analysts. Halliburton saw price target or ratings changes from the likes of Barclays, BMO, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Nomura and others (see full coverage). Halliburton now has a consensus price target up at $55.17, almost $4 higher than a month ago. Shares closed out the week at $48.43, in a 52-week range of $27.64 to $50.23. Kinder Morgan Inc. (NYSE: KMI) had a solid week after earnings indicated a higher dividend is likely to return in 2017. It received multiple analyst upgrades, with ratings upgrades from the likes of Stifel, Wolfe Research and Credit Suisse. It also received price target boosts from at least five other firms over the course of the week. Merrill Lynch raised its rating to Outperform from Neutral and raised its target to $25 in a re-upgrade (see full coverage). Shares ended the week at $21.11. The consensus price target is now up about a dollar from a month ago to $24.26. The 52-week range is $11.20 to $28.54. RSP Permian Inc. (NYSE: RSPP) already had made news this month by paying $2.4 billion to acquire Silver Hill, and it raised cash to pay for the deal. If the analysts on Wall Street are remotely close to accurate, this may be one of the Permian Basin’s cheapest oil stocks. On October 17 we saw many analysts defend the deal and raise targets (see full coverage). After closing at $41.03, this ended up down over 2% on the week, but still standing strong. RSP Permian now has a 52-week range of $16.74 to $43.30, and its consensus price target of $49.10 is up almost $5 from a month ago and up almost $10 from 90 days ago. Tenaris S.A. (NYSE: TS) was raised to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $33 at Piper Jaffray on October 18. It had previously closed at $28.80, and the price on Friday’s close was $28.99. This may not be your typical oil company, based on prices, but it is into steel pipe products and other related services for the oil and gas industry. It also hit a 52-week high this week. Western Refining Inc. (NYSE: WNR) was raised to Buy from Neutral at Citigroup on October 19. The stock closed at $28.07 ahead of the call but went out on Friday at $30.61. The 52-week range is $18.14 to $47.55, and the consensus price target is $27.73. Gulfport Energy Corp. (NASDAQ: GPOR) was raised to Buy from Neutral with a $35 price target (versus a $27.61 prior close) at Goldman Sachs on October 18. Shares closed down 2.5% at $26.51 on Friday, and that was down from closer to $30.00 at the start of the week. Still, the consensus price target of $35.18 implies handy upside. Oasis Petroleum Inc. (NYSE: OAS) was raised to Overweight from Neutral with a $16 price target at Piper Jaffray on October 19. The prior closing price was $10.57, but even with a 1.5% drop on Friday, it closed out the week at $11.42. For an opposite view: Goldman Sachs downgraded Oasis to Sell from Neutral with an $8.50 target just a day earlier.

The Week Staff AP Photo/Susan Walsh, file October 22, 2016 ADVERTISEMENT Sign Up for Our free email newsletters 10 things you need to know today Today's best articles The week's best photojournalism Today's top cartoons Daily business briefing The smartest insight and analysis, from all perspectives, rounded up from around the web: Looks like "Wall Street got something right for once," said Tim Mullaney at Market​Watch. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf abruptly resigned last week, forced into retirement by devastating revelations that employees secretly created some 2 million fraudulent accounts in order to meet unrealistic sales quotas. The banking giant had already fired some 5,000 workers over the scandal, but as it became clear that the malfeasance was rooted deep in Wells' corporate culture, "accountability needed to be had at the top." Finally, a banking executive is taking the fall for his company's misdeeds, said Helaine Olen in Slate. Why is this time different? JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon, for instance, still has his job despite the fact that lax oversight allowed rogue traders at his bank to lose more than $6 billion during the 2012 "London Whale" debacle. But while that scandal involved byzantine financial instruments like credit-default swaps, Wells' wrongdoing felt different, partly because it directly affected ordinary consumers. "It wasn't just that Wells Fargo expressed almost breathtaking contempt for its customers; it did it in a way they could easily understand." Even with Stumpf gone, "the pain likely isn't over" for the bank, said Christina Rexrode at The Wall Street Journal. Federal prosecutors are still weighing civil and criminal charges against Wells for its aggressive sales practices, while several state attorneys general are conducting their own investigations. Stumpf himself was stripped of $41 million in compensation before he resigned, and could stand to lose more; other Wells executives could face pay clawbacks as well. Then there are looming class-action lawsuits from both employees and investors. But overall, Wells Fargo "is in decent condition," said The Economist staff. The bank weathered the financial crisis much better than its competitors, remains profitable, and has a strong balance sheet. Even so, Wells' scandal could not have come at a worse time — in the middle of an election season marked by populist fervor. In this environment, even scandals that would once have been regarded as minor can quickly "spiral out of control." If only for PR purposes, "Wells Fargo needs to make a clean break with the past," said Gretchen Morgenson at The New York Times. So far, that doesn't appear to be happening. Timothy Sloan, the bank's president and former chief operating officer, is taking Stumpf's place as CEO. Shareholders can fairly ask, "Is Sloan, an almost 30-year veteran of Wells Fargo and a seasoned insider, the best executive to lead the bank out of crisis?" The answer is, probably not. Wells doesn't need small, incremental tweaks right now. It needs a "do-over to repair the damage." For now, though, let's celebrate this "all-too-rare example of corporate governance working the way it should," said James Stewart, also at the Times. Stumpf was forced out within a week of his embarrassing appearances before congressional panels, in which he laid blame for the scandal on low-level employees, instead of taking responsibility himself. "Ultimately the buck should stop with the chief executive — a simple truth that many boards often ignore." For once, "the buck stopped where it should have."

RUIZ DE GAUNANUEVA YORK Actualizado: 21/10/201619:11 horas 0comentarios Suscríbete La compra de Time Warner espoleará aún más el desarrollo de AT&T, que se ha acelerado en los últimos meses hasta permitirle entrar en verano en el club de las mayores empresas de la Bolsa, tras adelantar el banco Wells Fargo. Aunque JPMorgan ha rebasado ahora a AT&T, su impulso en los últimos meses refleja para los analistas la voluntad de crecer de la operadora y su apuesta por la diversificación. AT&T lleva tiempo analizando oportunidades de compra y también se llegó a plantear la adquisición de Yahoo!, el grupo de Internet que pasará finalmente a manos de su competidor Verizon. Aunque sus acciones han bajado hoy un 3% en Wall Street ante el reto que puede suponer digerir Time Warner, la trayectoria bursátil de AT&T acumula una subida de más del 15% en un año. La compañía que dirige Randall Stephenson vale más de 230.000 millones de dólares, cifra que se verá incrementada con creces si, finalmente, logra cerrar la compra de Time Warner. Para entonces, la nueva AT&T tendrá asegurado su puesto en el 'top ten' del mercado.

This imminent future is what both financial services and tech companies will discuss at the fifth annual Money 20/20 conference in Las Vegas next week. The reinvention of such a complex and highly regulated industry for the modern mobile and digital era requires cooperation between incumbents and upstarts alike. More than 10,000 attendees, including Wall Street bank executives and CEOs of Silicon Valley start-ups, are expected to attend. The conference will feature keynote speakers from established companies like Bank of America, Visa, First Data, Facebook, Alphabet's Google, PayPal, Square and Wal-Mart, as well as start-ups like Stripe, Pinterest and Poynt. Attendees will also hear from regulators and trade associations, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Chamber of Digital Commerce. The event has unveiled cutting-edge tech before. Last year alone, JPMorgan Chase announced mobile payments service Chase Pay, Nasdaq launched a private blockchain-powered trading platform called Linq, Citibank unveiled a cardless eye-scanning ATM, Amazon announced customers could "Pay with Amazon" in partner mobile apps and Samsung added new U.S. banking partners to Samsung Pay. Big topics will include payments and account security, reaching people who are currently "unbanked" and the transformative potential of blockchain technology. Blockchain Major financial services firms — from American Express to Goldman Sachs — are playing an increasingly important role in financing blockchain and bitcoin start-ups, CB Insights found. Blockchain is the technology that underlies bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. It's a public ledger of all transactions through a distributed database which maintains a continuously growing list of records or "blocks." Each block contains a time stamp and link to a previous block, securing the system from tampering and revision. "The area is going to make a very big impact [on financial services]," said David Blumberg, founder and managing partner of Blumberg Capital. Blockchain technology will significantly reduce the cost of buying a home, getting a mortgage or transferring currency, said Blumberg. Reaching the unbanked Many fintech firms are trying to give banking and credit services to individuals with no credit history, and to businesses considered too risky to get loans from bigger banks. The need is real. Seven percent of U.S. households did not have a bank account in 2015, according to a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. study released Thursday. Start-up Bee provides bank accounts, debit cards and financial services all through a mobile app for people who may have never had a bank account. Its strategy is to set up on street corners and register people on the spot. "A lot of fintech is now focused on helping individuals level the playing field so they can take advantage of services wealthy people or businesses have had for decades," said Blumberg, who is invested in Bee. Security Data breaches in the financial services industry have cost banks billion of dollars. The Target data breach — where as many as 40 million credit and debit cards were stolen — cost banks more than $200 million, according to the Consumer Bankers Association and the Credit Union National Association. Start-ups play a big role in helping financial institutions protect their assets, said Blumberg. Deep Instinct, a start-up whose customers include central banks and law enforcement agencies, uses a form of artificial intelligence called deep learning to identify and react to new threats as they appear. New technology is also making it easier to verify that someone logging into an account is who they say they are at the outset — and throughout the transaction. This is designed to address so-called man-in-the-middle attacks in which criminals grab a user's credentials once they are already logged into an account. BioCatch, a Money 20/20 sponsor, helps banks continuously verify a person's identity, using more than 500 different factors that add up to a unique user profile. They include personally identifiable characteristics such as the way you move your mouse, or hold your phone. Pass your device to another person midtransaction, and you may be prompted to recheck your identity, since the bank will recognize a difference in the way the phone is held. Some of the likely highlights of the conference will be an on-stage interview by CNBC's Kayla Tausche of Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and a keynote address from Kor Adana, writer and tech producer of USA Network's program "Mr Robot."

People lost faith in the financial system while many others saw the hit as new investing opportunity after the ” Too big to fail ” companies found a way out of the crisis . Tracking the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLF ) which represents one of the largest portions of the S&P 500 as it consists of the banks , insurance, real estate investment trust, capital markets, consumer finance, financial services and mortgage finance representing the most largest and recognizable financial institutions in the world such as JPMorgan , Wells Fargo , Bank of America , Citigroup , Goldman Sachs , American International Group , Chubb Limited and Warren Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway. After the the sharp drop in the 2008 financial crisis , an influx of government regulation and restructuring took place, which made the financial sector over the last five years considerably stronger as it rebounded giving investors an annual average return of 10.55% . Focusing on the top 5 holding Companies of XLF you notice that BRK , JPM , WFC are leading the recovery as their stock price already overtook the 2007 peaks while BAC and C keeps struggling like many other financial companies which didn’t even surpass 30 % of the decline. Shifting to the current 2016 performance of these companies we notice that only BRK & JPM are positive for the year while WFC is deeply in red with -14% . However The surprise came from Comerica ( CMA ) which is another large financial holding company that only represent 0.27% of XLF , the bank is up +18% and looking to add more gains in the coming months . With Q3 earnings coming out this week for most of the financial sector top companies , the overall performance could change rapidly but the bigger picture will remain the same so don’t worry as investing opportunities will always come out at the right time . We are always seekingthe right side of the market that’s why we at EWF use Elliott Wave in a different way combining it with market correlation, cycles, sequence of swings and distribution . Before buying or selling we search for the strongest & weakest instruments to find the right sequence that could provide a trading opportunities , that’s why Comerica & Wells Fergo stocks represent the best exemple if you are looking to invest in the financial sector. In my next articles, I’ll be covering the technical outlook for these 2 companies showing how to join the strong rally of CMA or how to profit during the decline of WFC by short selling its stock but maybe you are just a Warren buffet fan and you decide to go for the strong Berkshire Hathaway as it owns 10% of Wells Fergo .

White Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO John Stumpf, one of the CEOs of Berkshire Hathaway's big four investments, sat down with CNBC over the weekend at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, to talk about Warren Buffett, the folksy billionaire next door, in an interview airing on May 4, 2015. CNBC / NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Share Share Tweet Share Email Print Comment advertisement Big banks are making their shareholders happy, but ordinary Americans just don't trust them anymore, and that cynicism is weakening institutional trust across the board. Even with the shadow of a $185 million settlement hanging over one of its biggest players, the top banks had a good quarter: Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and even scandal-plagued Wells Fargo all beat analyst expectations when they announced their quarterly earnings last week. Chase, in particular, did much better than expected, as did Bank of America, which reported earnings Monday morning. Customers are less excited than investors, though. According to YouGov BrandIndex, which measures consumer perception, the banking sector actually had been rebuilding its reputation since customer sentiment plummeted during the recession, but the Wells Fargo scandal is changing people's views. Downward drag "You can see that banks in general have stayed pretty negative for much of the period from 2008 to 2014. As we've come out of the recession, people are feeling less negative," said YouGov BrandIndex CEO Ted Marzilli. "For Wells Fargo specifically, that brand has seen very large decreases in consumer perception. That's dragging down the whole sector," he said. Wells Fargo said the number of checking accounts opened fell by 25 percent, and the number of credit card openings dropped by 20 percent in September, compared with a year ago. "This is a scandal that touches at the heart of the relationship with customers," said Luigi Zingales, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. "It is really an image of breaching some fundamental trust that undermines not only the relationship with Wells Fargo, but the relationship with the financial institutions at large," he said. Related: After Wells Fargo Settlement, Questions About the Scandal Emerge Much of the focus has been on cross-selling and the aggressive pursuit of account-opening goals that boosted numbers at the expense of customers. In the aftermath of the settlement, Wells Fargo said it would stop the practice and place more emphasis on customer service. JPMorgan also touched on the topic of cross-selling, with CFO Marianne Lake saying that the bank had looked into the practice and found some issues, although she said they weren't "systemic." Some consumer advocates say the problem of prizing profits over people in big-bank culture goes deeper than sales tactics. "The Wells Fargo scandal confirmed to consumers that banks are more fixated on making money than helping their customers build wealth," Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director for U.S. PIRG, said via email. Loyalty on the wane Research about the consumer banking sector shows that loyalty and trust are scarce commodities. An Accenture survey found that only 30 percent of bank customers say they're loyal to their bank, and about a quarter were shopping around for another institution. A Gallup poll conducted in June, before the Wells Fargo scandal broke, found that Americans' trust in banks plunged 22 percentage points from 10 years earlier. While nearly half of respondents said before the recession that they trust banks, just over one in four say the same now. The lack of trust does seem to vary based on the type and size of the financial institution: A survey by the Chicago Booth/Kellogg School Financial Trust Index found that a majority of people trust credit unions and local banks, but the numbers are far lower for national banks and banks in which the government has a stake. "The impression that the national banks are not treating customers well is something that's been going on for a long time," said Zingales, one of the Index's creators. Related: Labor Department Will Probe Wells Fargo A report by the Brunswick Group blamed public mistrust in financial institutions for a more pervasive suspiciousness. "This view is exacerbated by a global perception that banks are part of an establishment that has ignored and hindered everyone except for those in the top 1 percent. This can be seen in the Brexit vote, as well as in the U.S. election," the report observed. In the U.S., this has implications beyond Wall Street, Zingales said. Conspiracy theories are thriving in this election cycle, and populist sentiment has been rising in voters of all political affiliations. "The mistrust they are developing in business is spilling over — now they don't trust anything," he said. Martha C.

Cyberattacks on a key internet firm repeatedly disrupted the availability of popular websites across the United States Friday, according to analysts and company officials. (Photo: Jim Cole / AP) Vulnerable internet-connected devices such as cameras and digital video recorders may be to blame for the attack that took down some of the world’s most popular websites on Friday. Malware that targets the “internet of things,” a new breed of small gadgets that are connected to the internet, may have powered the global attack, according to Brian Krebs, a well-known journalist covering computer security. Poorly secured devices may have been compromised and turned into a “botnet” that powered the attack, he wrote. Millions of internet users lost access to some of the world’s most popular websites on Friday as hackers hammered servers along the U.S. East Coast with phony traffic until they crashed, then moved westward. The attackers hit Dyn Inc., a provider of Domain Name System services, taking down sites including Twitter, Spotify, Reddit, CNN, Etsy and the New York Times for long stretches of time. By Friday evening, Dyn said it had stopped the hacks. “As you can imagine it has been a crazy day,” Dyn spokesman Adam Coughlin wrote in an e-mail. “At this moment (knock on wood) service has been restored.” Security professionals have been anticipating more attacks from malware that targets the “internet of things” since a hacker released software code that powers such malware, called Mirai, several weeks ago. Kyle York, chief strategy officer of Dyn, said the hackers launched a so-called distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack using“tens of millions” of malware-infected devices connected to the internet. Gillian M. Christensen, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said the agency and the FBI is aware of the incidents and “investigating all potential causes.” Internet Havoc Dyn first reported site outages relating to the DDoS attack around 7:10 a.m. New York time on Friday. The company restored service two hours later, but was offline again around noon, as another attack appeared to be underway, this time affecting the West Coast as well. While DDoS attacks don’t steal anything, they create havoc across the internet — and are on the increase in volume and power. Sites were affected as far away as Australia by a second wave of attacks that began at around 1 a.m. Sydney time on Saturday and lasted about five hours, said Dave Anderson, a London-based vice president of marketing at Dynatrace LLC, which monitors the performance of websites. At the peak of the attack, average DNS connect times for 2,000 websites monitored by Dynatrace went to about 16 seconds from 500 milliseconds normally. Vulnerable World “I have never seen severity this big, impacting so many sites and lasting over such a prolonged period of time,” Anderson said in a telephone interview. “It just shows how vulnerable and interconnected the world is, and when something happens in one region, it impacts every other region.” Dynatrace’s analytics aren’t able to trace the source of the attacks, Anderson said. Earlier Friday in the U.S.,Krebs wrote that the timing of the attacks corresponded with the release of research conducted by Dyn’s director of internet analysis. Dyn highlighted potential connections between firms that offer to protect against DDoS attacks, and the hackers who conduct them. Krebs’s own website faced an “extremely large and unusual” DDoS attack after he published a story based on the same research, he said. “We can’t confirm or even speculate on anyone’s motivation or relation to that research,” said Dave Allen, Dyn’s general counsel. Common Warfare With attacks on the internet’s Domain Name System,hackers compromise the underlying technology that governs how the web functions, making the hack far more powerful and widespread. The DNS translates website names into the Internet Protocol addresses that computers use to look up and access sites. But it has a design flaw: Sending a routine data request to a DNS server from one computer, the hacker can trick the system into sending a monster file of IP addresses back to the intended target. Multiply that by tens of thousands of computers under the hackers’ control, and the wall of data that flooded back is enormous. A small server may be capable of handling hundreds of simultaneous requests, but thousands every minute cause overload and ultimately shut down, taking the websites it hosts offline with it. The practice often is employed by groups of hackers. In 2012,a DDoS attack forced offline the websites of Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. Zombie’ Machines A DDoS can be achieved in a number of ways but commonly involves a distributed network of so-called “zombie” machines, referred to as botnets. A botnet is formed with computers and other connected devices in homes or offices infected with malicious code which, upon the request of a hacker, can flood a web server with data. One or two machines wouldn’t be an issue, but if tens or hundreds of thousands fire such data simultaneously, it can cripple even the most sophisticated web servers. In the case of the Dyn incident, the computers targeted were DNS servers. Without a DNS server, large numbers of websites are inaccessible by users across a country or even the world. In other words, taking away the DNS servers is like taking away all the road signs on a country’s highway system.So-called “authoritative” DNS providers like Dyn are notoriously hard to secure.Carl Herberger, vice president for security solutions at Radware, an Israeli-based internet security company, likens“authoritative” DNS providers to hospitals, which must admit anyone who shows up at the emergency room. Dyn must consider traffic going to a website as initially legitimate. In the event of a DDoS, Dyn must work quickly to sort out the bad traffic from the good, which takes time and resources, and creates outages that ripple across the internet, as was the case Friday. Dave Palmer, director of technology at U.K. cybersecurity company Darktrace, said the most recent DDoS attacks have been linked to internet-of-things devices, in particular web cams. No Joke “The joke about the internet of things was that you were going to get people hijacking people’s connected fridges to conduct these attacks, but in these recent cases the culprit seems to be webcams,” Palmer said. “We will probably see, when this is investigated, that it is a botnet of the internet of things.” To avoid massive outages, companies ramp up their capacity to try to absorb the deluge of traffic and reroute it, often with the help of a major telecommunications carrier or cloud-services provider like Akamai Technologies Inc. or CloudFlare Inc. But the only way to really prevent denial-of-service attacks may be to increase the overall security level of consumers around the world,Palmer said, a task that is getting harder as more and more devices are connected to the internet. “This is exactly what happens when tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of devices are left unprotected,” Palmer said.

Home World news Goldman CEO Blankfein ‘Supportive’ of Hillary Clinton for Pragmatism Goldman CEO Blankfein ‘Supportive’ of Hillary Clinton for Pragmatism Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., has shied away from publicly backing a presidential candidate this year, saying his support could harm that person’s chances. By: Bloomberg | Published: October 23, 2016 4:06 AM In an interview that will air Sunday on CNN’s “ Fareed Zakaria GPS,” Blankfein, asked if he personally supports and admires Democrat Hillary Clinton, said that he did. (AP) Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., has shied away from publicly backing a presidential candidate this year, saying his support could harm that person’s chances. Yet in an interview that will air Sunday on CNN’s “ Fareed Zakaria GPS,” Blankfein, asked if he personally supports and admires Democrat Hillary Clinton, said that he did. “I’m supportive of Hillary Clinton,” Blankfein said, according to a transcript provided by the network. “Yes, so flat out, yes, I do. That doesn’t say that I agree with all of her policies. I don’t. And that doesn’t say that I adopt everything that she’s done in her political career or has suggested that she might do going forward.” Clinton, 68, has been criticized, both in the primary fight against Senator Bernie Sanders and in the general election campaign against Republican Donald Trump, for her ties to Goldman Sachs. She was paid some $675,000 for three speeches to the New York-based bank in 2013, months after she had stepped down as secretary of state. Transcripts purported to be of the Goldman Sachs speeches were released by WikiLeaks on Oct. 15. Neither Goldman Sachs nor the Clinton campaign, which had declined to release the speeches, has confirmed the authenticity of the documents, although Blankfein said Clinton didn’t say “anything untoward” in her appearances. The CNN interview was conducted before the transcripts were released. ‘Willingness to Engage’ During her 2008 campaign, before investigations into Goldman’s sales of toxic mortgage securities turned Blankfein into one of the faces of the U.S. financial crisis, the executive held a fundraiser for Clinton. In the latest interview he admired her willingness to work with Republicans when she represented New York as a senator. “She could cross the aisle and engage other people to get things done,” Blankfein, 62, said on CNN. “That willingness to engage is a scarcer commodity these days.” Bank executives have been hesitant to wade into politics this election season. JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon on Oct. 17 offered a read-between-the-lines prediction that Clinton would win, drawing applause by referring to the next president as “she” at a conference. Blankfein was asked about the election in an interview in February and declined to take sides at that time. “I don’t want to help or hurt anybody by giving them an endorsement,” he told CNBC. In the wide-ranging CNN interview, Blankfein also said the U.S. economy, despite a “tepid” rate of growth, has a “lot of advantages,” including the extent to which consumers have de-leveraged since the 2008-09 financial crisis, and a sound banking system. ‘Generalized Anxiety’ “The sentiment is a lot worse than the economy,” he said, speaking about “a more generalized anxiety” evident in the 2016 political season. “I’m not minimizing the consequence to people who should have — who feel their jobs should be higher paid, and legitimately so, and the legitimate issues about minimum wages,” Blankfein said. “But at the end of the day, these problems always existed to some extent.” Speaking about financial regulation, Blankfein said that the rules in place now are strict, and that his biggest fear is that the potential misconduct of a rogue employee will be attributed to him and the bank as a whole. ‘Scared to Death’ “The world wants me to be scared to death of that and they want me to be vigilant at the end of the day, and they’ve accomplished their purpose,” Blankfein said. “They have me on edge all the time.” The latest banker to face the wrath of regulators is Wells Fargo & Co.’s John Stumpf, who resigned as chief executive this month amid the outcry over employees opening bogus accounts without customers’ knowledge. Some lawmakers have called for him to be criminally prosecuted. While Blankfein declined to address the situation specifically, he said that some financial misconduct isn’t intentional enough to be a crime. “To be punished the way people are saying they should be punished, you still have to find some kind of a criminal intent,” Blankfein said. “If you’re merely wrong and you didn’t get it right, it’s hard to ascribe criminality.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

Malware that targets the “internet of things,” a new breed of small gadgets that are connected to the internet, may have powered the global attack, according to Brian Krebs, a well-known journalist covering computer security. Poorly secured devices may have been compromised and turned into a “botnet” that powered the attack, he wrote. Millions of internet users lost access to some of the world’s most popular websites on Friday as hackers hammered servers along the U.S. East Coast with phony traffic until they crashed, then moved westward. The attackers hit Dyn Inc., a provider of Domain Name System services, taking down sites including Twitter, Spotify, Reddit, CNN, Etsy and the New York Times for long stretches of time. By Friday evening, Dyn said it had stopped the hacks. “As you can imagine it has been a crazy day,” Dyn spokesman Adam Coughlin wrote in an e-mail. “At this moment (knock on wood) service has been restored.” Security professionals have been anticipating more attacks from malware that targets the “internet of things” since a hacker released software code that powers such malware, called Mirai, several weeks ago. Kyle York, chief strategy officer of Dyn, said the hackers launched a so-called distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack using “tens of millions” of malware-infected devices connected to the internet. Gillian M. Christensen, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said the agency and the FBI is aware of the incidents and “investigating all potential causes.” Internet Havoc Dyn first reported site outages relating to the DDoS attack around 7:10 a.m. New York time on Friday. The company restored service two hours later, but was offline again around noon, as another attack appeared to be underway, this time affecting the West Coast as well. While DDoS attacks don’t steal anything, they create havoc across the internet -- and are on the increase in volume and power. Sites were affected as far away as Australia by a second wave of attacks that began at around 1 a.m. Sydney time on Saturday and lasted about five hours, said Dave Anderson, a London-based vice president of marketing at Dynatrace LLC, which monitors the performance of websites. At the peak of the attack, average DNS connect times for 2,000 websites monitored by Dynatrace went to about 16 seconds from 500 milliseconds normally. Vulnerable World “I have never seen severity this big, impacting so many sites and lasting over such a prolonged period of time,” Anderson said in a telephone interview. “It just shows how vulnerable and interconnected the world is, and when something happens in one region, it impacts every other region.” Dynatrace’s analytics aren’t able to trace the source of the attacks, Anderson said. Earlier Friday in the U.S., Krebs wrote that the timing of the attacks corresponded with the release of research conducted by Dyn’s director of internet analysis. Dyn highlighted potential connections between firms that offer to protect against DDoS attacks, and the hackers who conduct them. Krebs’s own website faced an “extremely large and unusual” DDoS attack after he published a story based on the same research, he said. “We can’t confirm or even speculate on anyone’s motivation or relation to that research,” said Dave Allen, Dyn’s general counsel. Common Warfare With attacks on the internet’s Domain Name System, hackers compromise the underlying technology that governs how the web functions, making the hack far more powerful and widespread. The DNS translates website names into the Internet Protocol addresses that computers use to look up and access sites. But it has a design flaw: Sending a routine data request to a DNS server from one computer, the hacker can trick the system into sending a monster file of IP addresses back to the intended target. Multiply that by tens of thousands of computers under the hackers’ control, and the wall of data that flooded back is enormous. A small server may be capable of handling hundreds of simultaneous requests, but thousands every minute cause overload and ultimately shut down, taking the websites it hosts offline with it. The practice often is employed by groups of hackers. In 2012, a DDoS attack forced offline the websites of Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. ‘Zombie’ Machines A DDoS can be achieved in a number of ways but commonly involves a distributed network of so-called “zombie” machines, referred to as botnets. A botnet is formed with computers and other connected devices in homes or offices infected with malicious code which, upon the request of a hacker, can flood a web server with data. One or two machines wouldn’t be an issue, but if tens or hundreds of thousands fire such data simultaneously, it can cripple even the most sophisticated web servers. In the case of the Dyn incident, the computers targeted were DNS servers. Without a DNS server, large numbers of websites are inaccessible by users across a country or even the world. In other words, taking away the DNS servers is like taking away all the road signs on a country’s highway system.   So-called “authoritative” DNS providers like Dyn are notoriously hard to secure. Carl Herberger, vice president for security solutions at Radware, an Israeli-based internet security company, likens “authoritative” DNS providers to hospitals, which must admit anyone who shows up at the emergency room. Dyn must consider traffic going to a website as initially legitimate. In the event of a DDoS, Dyn must work quickly to sort out the bad traffic from the good, which takes time and resources, and creates outages that ripple across the internet, as was the case Friday. Dave Palmer, director of technology at U.K. cybersecurity company Darktrace, said the most recent DDoS attacks have been linked to internet-of-things devices, in particular web cams. No Joke “The joke about the internet of things was that you were going to get people hijacking people’s connected fridges to conduct these attacks, but in these recent cases the culprit seems to be webcams,” Palmer said. “We will probably see, when this is investigated, that it is a botnet of the internet of things.” Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

The Guardian 10/22/2016 Alex Hern © AP Twitter’s market cap is down $3.5bn from its peak at the height of the buyout rumours. Twitter might have finally found some motivation to deal with its troll problem. Three and a half billion motivations, really. Quotes in the article Walt Disney Co DIS ▼ 97.70 -0.22 -0.22% Salesforce.com Inc CRM ▲ 74.02 +1.26 +1.73% Twitter Inc TWTR ▼ 18.98 -0.16 -0.84% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 78.23 -0.81 -1.03% The company has spent the past few months courting potential buyouts from companies including Google, Disney, and enterprise software firm Salesforce. That last suitor came closest of them all to actually making an offer, apparently driven by the potential of Twitter to provide an in-house social network that could be mined for data, used as a casual communication channel between customers and corporations, and tweaked into a passable professional networking service. But in the end, it passed. And part of the reason, according to CNBC’s Jim Cramer, is the company’s long-running problem dealing with trolls. “What’s happened is, a lot of the bidders are looking at people with lots of followers and seeing the hatred,” Cramer said. “Twitter says ‘listen, we have a filter’. I mean, the filter filters out a very small amount of the haters, and I know that the haters reduce the value of the company.” And Salesforce isn’t the only one. A Bloomberg report suggests that Disney, which went so far in its exploration as to hire JP Morgan Chase to help evaluate the bid, was equally concerned. “Walt Disney Co. decided not to pursue a bid for Twitter Inc. partly out of concern that bullying and other uncivil forms of communication on the social media site might soil the company’s wholesome family image, according to people familiar with management’s thinking,” the news service reports. Twitter has long struggled to prevent abusive users from overwhelming discussion on the social network. In 2015, its then chief executive Dick Costolo famously told staff that the company “sucks at dealing with abuse and trolls”, after a Guardian article by the columnist Lindy West about her experience. But user perception is still that abuse is a low priority for Twitter, with new efforts at tackling misuse of the platform few and far between compared with features such as Moments, which allows users to curate shareable content, or expanded message lengths, allowing them to add more images to any given tweet. Now, Twitter has one final motivation to take the problem seriously. The company’s market cap is down $3.5bn from its peak at the height of the buyout rumours, and if what Cramer says is true, some portion of that multibillion collapse is directly caused by the perception that Costolo complained about over a year ago. Will Twitter take action to protect its value, even if it hasn’t to protect its users?
