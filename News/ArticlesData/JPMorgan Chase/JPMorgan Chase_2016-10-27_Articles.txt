Africa América Latina عربي Argentina Brasil Canada 中国 Deutschland España France India Italia 日本 México РОССИЯ United Kingdom United States Money News | Sat Oct 29, 2016 | 12:46am IST Exclusive - Germany's Merck explores sale of biosimilar drug business: sources By Carl O'Donnell and Greg Roumeliotis German chemicals and pharmaceuticals company Merck KGaA (MRCG.DE) is exploring a sale of its biosimilars unit, according to people familiar with the matter, as that business faces fierce competition from larger players in the sector. Biosimilars, the biotechnology-based equivalents of generic drugs, have become increasingly popular amid a drive to curb price increases. Stefan Oschmann, however, who took over as Merck's CEO earlier this year, has been focussed on finding ways to safeguard his company's leading position in the multiple sclerosis market. Its top selling drug in this space is Rebif. Merck has hired investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to sound out potential buyers for the biosimilar business, the people said on Friday. There is no guarantee that the discussions will result in any deal, they added. Merck's biosimilars business could be worth as much as $1 billion because of its long-term sales potential, the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Merck, which is independent of U.S. drug marker Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N), declined to comment. A JPMorgan spokeswoman offered no immediate comment. Merck's biosimilar business includes a drug in advanced clinical trials that is a competitor to AbbVie Inc's (ABBV.N) popular arthritis treatment Humira. The unit also has several early-stage compounds. Merck is facing off against several larger competitors, including Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Novartis AG (NOVN.S), both of which have won regulatory approval for biosimilar drugs. Biosimilars have become an increasing area of focus for investors and industry executives in the past year, as regulators have begun approving a handful of compounds in the United States. Biosimilars are more complex than traditional drugs, requiring genetically engineered proteins. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration was not allowed to consider generic versions of biologic drugs until U.S. President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010. So far, the FDA has approved four biosimilar drugs, most recently a competitor for Humira made by Amgen Inc (AMGN.O). There are more than 60 biosimilars awaiting approval. More of those drugs are expected to be approved in the coming years, as biologic drugs representing more than $30 billion in sales will lose their patent protection between now and 2020, according to data from IMS Health. In Europe, where biosimilars were approved by regulators as early as 2006, more than 21 biosimilars made by 14 companies have been approved.

There are plenty of reasons to conclude that JPMorgan Chase is an attractive buy at today’s price. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 28, 2016 at 10:40AM Image source: Wikimedia Commons. There are few industries that have suffered as much over the last decade as banks, causing their stocks to tumble. But this shouldn't be interpreted as a reason to avoid the space. As a cursory analysis of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) shows, this is when enterprising investors want to think about adding these stocks to their portfolios. Bank stock valuations There's one reason that big bank stocks, like JPMorgan Chase, are compelling right now: valuation. Analysts and investors tend to value bank stocks by comparing their share prices to their book values per share. The typical bank in ordinary times will trade at or around one times book value, though this will vary over time as the prospects for the industry rise and fall with the business cycle. JPM Price to Book Value data by YCharts. When times are great and banks are making a lot of money, bank stocks trade for two or more times book value. But when the economy takes a turn for the worse, fueling loan losses and thereby weighing on bank share prices, bank stocks will trade for meaningful discounts to book value. It's for that reason that bank investors try to adhere to the axiom: "buy at half of book value and sell at two times book value." Doing that is hard, as calling either the bottom or the top of the market is difficult, if not impossible. Yet, you don't have to get your timing exactly right to still benefit from this approach. Why JPMorgan Chase stock is compelling Right now, JPMorgan Chase's shares offer a case in point. The nation's biggest bank by assets is trading for 1.1 times book value. That's not the bargain basement price that Bank of America or Citigroup are trading at -- approximately 30% below their respective book values -- but it's nevertheless reasonable when considering that JPMorgan Chase could easily trade for 1.5 times book value or higher in the years ahead. I say that because JPMorgan Chase is bound to make a lot more money when interest rates rise. There's no telling when that will happen, though chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon believes the Federal Reserve should do so sooner rather than later. Either way, it's safe to assume that higher rates are in the cards for the future. JPMorgan Chase even goes so far as to estimate how much this could help its top line. According to its latest quarterly filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission, a 100 basis point, or 1 percentage point, boost in rates would translate into $3 billion more net interest income. If rates rose by 200 basis points, it would generate $4.9 billion more net interest income from its asset portfolio. This would not only increase JPMorgan's profitability, it would also enable it to continue growing its already voluptuous dividend. The New York-based bank's shares yield 2.8%. That's the sixth highest among the nation's blue-chip bank stocks -- the roughly two dozen stocks on the KBW Bank Index -- and it's well above the 2.1% average yield on the S&P 500. While it's impossible to predict the future with any semblance of certainty, it's not unreasonable to think that JPMorgan Chase's shareholders will benefit as we proceed further and further away from the low interest rates produced by the financial crisis.

Jordan Wathen (TMFValueMagnet) Oct 27, 2016 at 1:42PM Image source: Visa. Since its initial public offering, Visa's (NYSE:V) stock performance has been nothing short of extraordinary. In its very first day of trading, shares jumped 28% over their IPO price, kicking off a seemingly endless rally that continued for years. I've compiled what I believe to be 10 of the biggest events that define Visa's history as a publicly traded company, with each event marked on the chart below. 1. A record IPO On March 19, 2008, Visa's IPO prices at $44 per share ($11 per share when adjusted for a later stock split). The company earned the title of being the largest U.S. IPO in the history of the stock market. The next day, the first day in which shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, the stock closed at $56.50 per share ($14.13 per split-adjusted share).   The IPO was remarkable in context. Remember, this was March 2008, just five days after JPMorgan offered to buy the remnants of the battered investment bank Bear Stearns for just $2 per share. It was a trying time for financial stocks, but Visa was a clear exception. 2. Visa can't shake its financial industry association What investors like most about Visa is that it isn't a lender. It doesn't make credit card loans, and it certainly wasn't issuing mortgages that caused the crisis in the first place. Visa is simply a payment network -- a toll road -- and it collects a fee on every swipe of a Visa card. But being far removed from problematic loans couldn't keep its share price from following the financial stock slump in 2009. On Jan. 20, 2009, Visa shares ended the day at their all-time closing low of $42.42 ($10.60 per split-adjusted share). 3. Regulators have a field day Just as the IPO window was open to Visa in 2008, the regulatory window was wide open in 2009 and 2010. On May 13, 2010, the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act was revealed, which, if passed, would have directed the Federal Reserve to ensure that debit interchange fees were "reasonable and proportional to the processing costs incurred." Stated differently, the goal of the Durbin Amendment was to make processing debit transactions less profitable. A statement by then-Senate Majority Leader Dick Durbin (D-IL) made his targets quite clear. Wall Street reform is really about two things: holding the big banks accountable for how they operate and empowering consumers to make good financial choices. Passage of this amendment is a win for the public on both fronts. Passage of this measure gives small businesses and their customers a real chance in the fight against the outrageously high "swipe fees" charged by Visa and MasterCard. It will prevent the giant credit card companies from using anti-competitive practices, allow merchants to offer discounts to their customers and restore common sense and fairness to this broken system. By requiring debit card fees to be reasonable, and by cleaning up Visa's and MasterCard's worst abuses, small businesses and their customers will be able to keep more of their own money. Making sure small businesses can grow and prosper is vital to putting our country back on solid economic footing. You can tell from the language in Durbin's statement that this was no ordinary time. Financial companies of all stripes -- banks and non-banks -- were universally hated all the way from the halls of the Senate to Main Street USA. Visa shares plummeted after Durbin's statement was released.  4. The Fed shocks banks and card networks Empowered by the Durbin Amendment to oversee debit card fees, the Federal Reserve outlined a proposal to cap interchange fees on Dec. 16, 2010. It suggested capping interchange fees at $0.12 per transaction, a fraction of the then-estimated average fee of $0.44 per swipe. After recouping roughly half of the Durbin-inspired decline, Visa's stock took a nosedive. Investors broadly feared that profits would be regulated away. 5. Durbin's dustbin The Fed's plan to cap debit fees at $0.12 per transaction faced stiff opposition from the financial industry. On June 29, 2011, the Federal Reserve issued its final rule, which capped interchange fees at $0.21 plus 0.05% of the transaction amount. The Fed allowed for the fee to increase by $0.01 per transaction if certain security measures were implemented.  Visa shareholders breathed a sigh of relief, and share prices rocketed. Matthew Yglesias, a writer for Slate.com, may have written the best take on the company's rapid share price appreciation: A stock that sold for $75 on July 28 is suddenly worth more than $86 the next day. What happened? Did they invent some magical new form of credit card? Of course not. Instead, Visa joined its comrade MasterCard in popping the champagne over the Federal Reserve's surprisingly light regulatory touch. For reference, the split-adjusted prices of Visa in the above quote were $17.75 and $21.50, respectively. It's hard to overstate just how important the Durbin Amendment was to Visa stockholders. In its 2011 annual report, Visa reported that over $1 trillion of debit transactions moved over its network in the United States alone, substantially more than the $641 billion of credit transactions it processed the same year. If you held shares of Visa back then, you certainly remember the Durbin Amendment as being a very big deal. If not, you can rest assured this is the last time I'll mention it. But for the sake of closure, I must mention that the amendment went into effect on Oct. 1, 2011. 6. Visa links up with JPMorgan On Feb. 26, 2013, The Wall Street Journal reported that Visa and JPMorgan Chase quietly agreed to a 10-year deal that would allow JPMorgan to effectively lease Visa's network for its cards. Under the terms of the agreement, JPMorgan agreed to shift more of its card volume to Visa, while Visa gave the bank abilities that effectively created a quasi-closed loop card network akin to Discover and American Express. The bank wasted no time in putting Visa's network to work. Its merchant processing volume ramped up quickly as its customers began to work directly with JPMorgan for payment processing. In 2012, the bank processed $655 billion of merchant volume, which grew to $949 billion in 2015.  7. Becoming a "blue chip" Visa joined a very exclusive list on Sept. 23, 2013, when it became one of just 30 companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Shortly thereafter, its biggest competitor, MasterCard (NYSE:MA), announced that it would split its shares 10-for-1 in what might have amounted to an effort -- albeit a late one -- to be the payment network of choice in the Dow 30.  Visa is still a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average today. 8. On the road to China, maybe Shares of Visa and MasterCard surged on Oct. 29, 2014, as China's announcement that it would loosen rules gave UnionPay an effective monopoly on transaction volume inside its borders. The news was compounded by Visa's and MasterCard's positive earnings releases and reports that the economy was growing at the fastest pace since the Great Recession -- 3.5% during the third quarter of 2014. Alas, for all the excitement about China then, little is happening now. Visa's 2015 annual report tells the tale: Though the Chinese State Council has announced that international schemes, such as Visa, would be able to participate in the domestic market and be eligible to apply for a license to operate a Bank Card Clearing Institution (BCCI) in China, legislation and implementation guidelines for BCCI's have yet to be published and finalized. 9. Visa does the splits On March 19, 2015, Visa began trading after completing a 4-for-1 split in which shareholders saw the shares they owned multiplied by four. After closing at $267.67 per share prior to the split, shares closed the following day at $66.81 each. 10. Reconnecting with a long-lost twin Long awaited by Wall Street, Visa announced its plan to acquire Visa Europe on Nov. 11, 2015. The deal, valued as richly as 21.2 billion euro, would unify its brand around the world. In the press release, Visa noted that acquiring its European brother would put more than 500 million more cards and more than 1.5 trillion euro of annual purchase volume under the Visa umbrella. The deal was finalized on June 21, 2016, putting all the pieces of Visa back together again. A trip down memory lane The most amazing thing about Visa is that at no point has it ever been statistically cheap. It frequently trades at significantly higher earnings multiples than the market at large. But multiples are backward looking, and its growth has been tremendous.  Even at 58 years of age, Visa is still delivering with double-digit annual increases in profits, buoyed by continuous growth in payment volume. With each passing year, inflation increases the amount of money in circulation and cash loses share to cards, pushing more transaction volume to Visa's network. Those two very simple themes have underlain its spectacular returns since its IPO, rewarding its most loyal investors very handsomely over the last eight years.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 27, 2016 at 12:22PM Image source: The Motley Fool. Generally speaking, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is a solid stock for investors who want to minimize downside risk without forgoing meaningful growth opportunities. But this shouldn't be interpreted to mean that there aren't risks associated with owning this bank stock. The biggest risk to JPMorgan Chase Above all, the scariest thing about JPMorgan Chase's stock is the fact that regulators have set their sights on making life difficult for the nation's biggest banks. And given that the New York-based bank is the largest bank in the country, it's safe to assume that it's high on regulators' list. Under legislation passed since the financial crisis, eight so-called global systemically important banks, or G-SIBs, must hold much more capital than their smaller, simpler peers. For its part, JPMorgan Chase has to keep 3.5% more capital in reserve than its competitors in the regional banking space. This is known as the G-SIB surcharge. Why Are Some Banks Too Big To Fail? from John J. Maxfield. The additional reserve requirement reduces the amount of leverage that JPMorgan Chase can use to juice its profits, and thereby weighs directly on its profitability. This is reflected in part in the bank's valuation. Prior to the 2008 crisis, JPMorgan's shares traded in the vicinity of 1.5 times book value or above. Today, they trade for only 1.1 times book value. This is in part because interest rates are unprecedentedly low, which limits how much banks can earn from making loans. But just as importantly, it can't be denied that JPMorgan's depressed valuation also stems from the fact that investors and analysts are concerned that regulators could continue to tighten the proverbial screws on large banks in an effort to eliminate the too-big-to-fail problem. Big banks are in regulators' crosshairs We got a taste for how aggressive bank regulators could become earlier this year, when two of the Federal Reserve's top officials intimated that they will continue to make things difficult for universal banks like JPMorgan Chase -- that is, banks with both investment and commercial banking operations. Here's the view of Fed governor Daniel Tarullo, whom The Wall Street Journal calls "The Most Powerful Man in Banking": "I think it likely that firms are going to have to change in some cases their size, in some cases their business model, and in some cases their organization." And here's Tarullo's colleague echoing the same sentiment: "I have not reached any conclusion that a particular bank needs to be broken up or anything like that," Fed governor Jerome Powell said at an industry conference earlier this year. The point is instead to "raise capital requirements to the point at which it becomes a question that banks have to ask themselves." This is an ominous sign for banks, and JPMorgan Chase in particular. As it is the nation's biggest bank by assets, and one that has a particularly robust presence on Wall Street, in addition to its sizable commercial banking operations, there's little doubt that regulators are talking specifically about it, as well as a handful of its competitors. All that said, I tend to think that investors can do a lot worse than JPMorgan Chase. Warren Buffett himself has expressed admiration for the bank's CEO, Jamie Dimon, on multiple occasions in the past. And one of Buffett's lieutenants has even joined the JPMorgan Chase board of directors. That's quite an endorsement, and it's enough for me to conclude that JPMorgan Chase is a solid stock to add to any long-term investor's portfolio.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 26, 2016 at 7:29PM JPMorgan Chase chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. Image source: JPMorgan Chase. A bet on bank stocks right now is a bet on interest rates -- or, more specially, on whether the Federal Reserve will increase the Fed Funds rate. What's the likelihood this will happen in the near future? If JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has his way, it should happen sooner rather than later. Dimon's comments Speaking at The Economic Club of Washington D.C. recently, Dimon fielded a question about whether the central bank should raise rates at one of its next meetings. Here's what the 60-year-old JPMorgan Chase executive had to say: Let's just raise rates. You don't want to be behind the eight ball on this. The Fed has to maintain credibility. Normality is a good thing not a bad thing. An economy that's been going like this for seven years is a good thing not a bad thing. So, to me, the return to normal is a good thing. The rate itself gets a lot more psychological attention than the actual economic effect of raising rates. Then, in response to a follow-up question about when the Fed should pull the trigger, Dimon responded: I'd go sooner rather than later, but I'll leave the exact timing up to them. They've made it clear that they're going to raise rates when they see the whites of their eyes; when they see the economy is strong enough. It's for this reason that Dimon thinks now, or rather at the Fed's meeting in December, is the time to raise rates. As he noted, the unemployment rate is down to 4.9%, inflation is ticking up, household formation is improving, and asset prices are up. In his opinion, then, the economy is strong enough to justify a move by the Fed to boost the benchmark Fed Funds rate, from which all other interest rates derive. What this would mean for banks It's worth keeping in mind that, even if the central bank were to raise rates at its next meeting, the increase would likely be minimal. Last December, when it did so for the first time since the financial crisis, it boosted the Fed Funds rate by a quarter of a percent, or 0.25%. That's a tiny improvement. But at the same time, it'd signal to investors that the Fed believes the economy is strong enough to withstand another hike. This has been far from a foregone conclusion over the past year, given the uncertainty in financial markets tied to slowing economic growth in China, concerns about the United Kingdom's pending exit from the European Union, and ultralow oil and gas prices that have made it hard for energy companies to service their bank loans. If the Fed were to follow Dimon's advice, the move would almost certainly cause bank stocks to climb sharply. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C) in particular would be major beneficiaries of such an announcement. Shares of these two banks trade for substantial discounts to book value -- Bank of America for a 30% discount, and Citigroup for a 33% discount. And the principal reason they're so cheap is because low interest rates have made it all but impossible for them to meet their profitability targets. Consider this: according to Bank of America's latest quarterly regulatory filing, the nation's second biggest bank by assets would earn an added $7.5 billion in net interest income if rates rose 100 basis points. Citigroup's net interest income would climb $2 billion. Meanwhile, JPMorgan Chase's would get a $3 billion boost. Suffice it to say that this would make all three of these banks much more profitable, which would almost certainly then be reflected in higher share prices.

The upgrade of the primary servicer of Prime product rating reflects enhancements to Chase's servicing operations that are focused on improving the customer experience and increasing efficiencies. The upgrade, as well as the affirmation of the other Primary and Special servicer ratings and Stable Rating Outlook, reflects operational improvements, technology enhancements, continued progress on regulatory settlements, and consistent internal audit and Regulation AB (Reg AB) results. The affirmation of the master servicer rating and Stable Outlook reflect the company's established master servicing operation, continued support for the platform, consistent Reg AB and USAP results, and Fitch's observations regarding portfolio runoff. All of the servicer ratings incorporate the company's financial condition. Chase is rated 'AA-' with a Stable Outlook by Fitch. A company's financial condition is a component of Fitch's servicer rating analysis. Enhancements to Chase's servicing operations during the current review period included improved capacity planning to optimize customer communication channels leveraging multi-function specialists, streamlined processing of correspondence, and proactive monitoring of customer inquiries to identify complaints. Chase also expanded its use of scripting to increase the efficiency of processing payment exceptions. In addition, Chase developed and implemented a new platform for the management of its third party oversight program, and migrated the management of third party providers to the new platform. Chase continues to make progress on regulatory settlements entered into over the past several years. In January 2016, the OCC terminated the mortgage servicing-related consent order against Chase, and in September 2016, the RMBS Settlement Monitor released its final report regarding Chase's compliance with the settlement. Chase's internal audit reports continue to show an improving trend, with the number of significant findings remaining low. In addition, in Chase's most recent Reg AB report, the number of instances of material noncompliance for the primary and special servicing platform remained at one, which is consistent with the prior review. The most recent USAP report did not contain any instances of non-compliance. Chase's servicing operations are headquartered in Columbus OH, with additional servicing sites in Dallas, Phoenix, Monroe, LA and Jacksonville, FL and a captive site in Manila, the Philippines. As of June 30, 2016, Chase's primary and special servicing portfolio was comprised of more than 5.7 million loans totaling $881.3 billion. Washington Mutual Mortgage Securities Corp. (WMMSC), a subsidiary of Chase, continues to be the legal entity overseeing Chase's master servicing activities. WMMSC has been operating for more than 38 years, including several predecessor entities that Chase acquired from Washington Mutual Bank (WaMu) and EMC Mortgage. Chase is leveraging the master servicing operation in its oversight of two subservicers. The most recent Reg AB and USAP reports for the master servicing operation did not contain any instances of material non-compliance, which is consistent with the prior review. WMMSC's portfolio continues to decrease, with no loans expected to be added to the platform to offset runoff. As of June 30, 2016, WMMSC's portfolio was comprised of approximately 23,700 loans totaling $7 billion, a decrease of 8.5% in loan count from 25,900 loans totaling $8 billion as of June 30, 2015. Fitch is concerned that as the portfolio continues to decline and with limited opportunities for new master servicing assignments due to low RMBS issuance, WMMSC may not continue to provide timely updates to its systems and processes with operational enhancements that incorporate industry changes. Fitch believes that Chase has capable primary, special, and master servicing operations with the staff, procedures, controls, default management processes, and technology to manage its current servicing portfolio. Fitch rates residential mortgage primary, master, and special servicers on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being the highest rating. Within some of these rating levels, Fitch further differentiates ratings by plus (+) and minus (-) as well as the flat rating.

Biosimilars, the biotechnology-based equivalents of generic drugs, have become increasingly popular amid a drive to curb price increases. Stefan Oschmann, however, who took over as Merck's CEO earlier this year, has been focused on finding ways to safeguard his company's leading position in the multiple sclerosis market. Its top selling drug in this space is Rebif. Merck has hired investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co to sound out potential buyers for the biosimilar business, the people said on Friday. There is no guarantee that the discussions will result in any deal, they added. Merck's biosimilars business could be worth as much as $1 billion because of its long-term sales potential, the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Merck, which is independent of U.S. drug marker Merck & Co Inc, declined to comment. A JPMorgan spokeswoman offered no immediate comment. Merck's biosimilar business includes a drug in advanced clinical trials that is a competitor to AbbVie Inc's popular arthritis treatment Humira. The unit also has several early-stage compounds. Merck is facing off against several larger competitors, including Pfizer Inc and Novartis AG, both of which have won regulatory approval for biosimilar drugs. Biosimilars have become an increasing area of focus for investors and industry executives in the past year, as regulators have begun approving a handful of compounds in the United States. Biosimilars are more complex than traditional drugs, requiring genetically engineered proteins. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration was not allowed to consider generic versions of biologic drugs until U.S. President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010. So far, the FDA has approved four biosimilar drugs, most recently a competitor for Humira made by Amgen Inc. There are more than 60 biosimilars awaiting approval. More of those drugs are expected to be approved in the coming years, as biologic drugs representing more than $30 billion in sales will lose their patent protection between now and 2020, according to data from IMS Health. In Europe, where biosimilars were approved by regulators as early as 2006, more than 21 biosimilars made by 14 companies have been approved.

The bank said Friday that it plans to spend $200 million to make over the 20-year old office building. The bank also plans some work at its mortgage operations at Easton. "To be investing this amount of money in a single facility certainly makes a statement of our commitment to the market and desire to have a facility that attracts the best and brightest in Columbus and around the world," Chase spokesman Jeff Lyttle said. The McCoy Center is Chase's largest building in the world and houses 10,000 workers. At 2 million square feet, the building is basically the size of the Empire State Building. While there will be cosmetic improvements to the building, including a remake of the quarter-mile atrium inside the McCoy Center, the focus will be on creating customized work space for employees. "There will be many more collaborative spaces where teams can gather and brainstorm, room with floor to ceiling whiteboards that they can write and come up with ideas," Lyttle said of the McCoy Center. The banking industry has changed significantly since the McCoy Center opened. Today, much of the focus of the workers at the building and surrounding campus is on technology. Teams are working on digital products such as Chase's website, mobile apps and products for consumers and small businesses along with improvements on Chase offices and ATMs. "It's re-imagining the work space. It's the reflection of the changing nature of the industry, the largest tech hub for the firm in the world," Lyttle said. Worker already has started on the roof, but the project is expected to take several years to complete. As part of the project, Chase also plans work at its building on Vision Drive at Easton. mawilliams@dispatch.com @BizMarkWilliams Favorite Print Story Advertisement • Place an ad News Video More Videos Advertisement • Place an ad Explore Columbus Search Businesses Featured Businesses Loading...

(TSX VENTURE: MBC) ("MBAC" or the "Company") is pleased to announce the completion of the Canadian portion of its previously announced recapitalization transaction (the "Recapitalization") pursuant to an amended and restated plan of compromise and arrangement (the "CCAA Plan") under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (Canada) (the "CCAA") dated September 14, 2016. As previously announced, the CCAA Plan was approved by affected unsecured creditors of the Company that voted, in person or by proxy, at a meeting held on September 20, 2016. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice (Commercial List) (the "Court") granted an order approving the CCAA Plan on October 3, 2016. In combination with the CCAA Plan, MBAC and certain affiliates implemented a concurrent plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act (the "CBCA Plan" and together with the CCAA Plan, the "Plan"). Implementation of the Plan will result in a number of benefits to the Company, including, among other things, a significant reduction of the Company's debt and improved financial flexibility for the Company. Additional information regarding MBAC's CCAA proceedings is available on the website established by Ernst & Young Inc., in its capacity as court-appointed monitor, at http://www.ey.com/ca/mbac. Effect of the Plan The working capital and operational requirements of MBAC and its subsidiaries prior to and during the CCAA process were funded by secured interim financing (the "Interim Financing") provided by Zaff LLC (the "Plan Sponsor") pursuant to secured promissory notes and pursuant to a DIP term sheet that was approved by the Court on August 4, 2016. The Interim Financing in an aggregate principal amount of approximately U.S.$11.4 million was advanced by the Plan Sponsor in connection with the implementation of the Plan and the Brazilian Proceedings (as defined below). Prior to the implementation of the Plan, the Plan Sponsor was the owner of substantially all outstanding secured and guaranteed funded debt of the Company and its Brazilian subsidiaries (other than guaranteed debts owing to Banco Modal S.A.) as well as certain outstanding unsecured debts of the Company and the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries that were not guaranteed by the Company (collectively, the "Acquired Debt"), which claims, together with the claims of other creditors of MBAC and its subsidiaries, were compromised through the CCAA Plan or are anticipated to be comprised through the Brazilian Plan (as defined below). As a result of the implementation of the Plan: --  MBAC completed a vertical amalgamation with two wholly-owned
    subsidiaries. The resulting entity ("MBAC Amalco") is named "MBAC
    Fertilizer Corp.".

--  Common shares of MBAC Amalco ("Common Shares") issued and outstanding
    immediately prior to the implementation of the Plan were consolidated at
    a ratio of one (1) post-consolidation Common Share for each 100 pre-
    consolidation Common Shares (the "Consolidation"). Any fractional Common
    Shares resulting from the Consolidation were rounded down to the next
    whole share without any additional compensation thereof. As a result of
    the Consolidation and the other steps described below, holders of such
    shares represent approximately 3.48% of the equity of MBAC Amalco in the
    aggregate. A letter of transmittal with respect to the Consolidation
    will be mailed to affected shareholders which letter sets out
    instructions as to how registered shareholders can receive certificates
    representing post-Consolidation Common Shares.

--  MBAC Amalco continued under the laws of the Cayman Islands.

--  The Plan Sponsor transferred to MBAC Amalco its indirect interest in
    approximately U.S.$237 million of secured and unsecured debt plus
    accrued interest owing by the Brazilian subsidiaries of MBAC to the Plan
    Sponsor or its affiliates, in exchange for 34,291,400 Common Shares.

--  The Plan Sponsor transferred to MBAC Amalco its indirect interest in (i)
    GB Minerals Ltd., a TSX Venture Exchange (the "TSXV") listed phosphate
    exploration company; and (ii) Stonegate Agricom Ltd., a TSX listed
    phosphate exploration company, in exchange for an aggregate of 9,569,760
    Common Shares.

--  The Plan Sponsor settled the Interim Financing, as well as the funding
    provided by the Plan Sponsor to satisfy cash distributions under the
    Plan in the amount of approximately C$700,000, in exchange for 6,012,986
    Common Shares.

--  Certain unsecured creditors of MBAC elected to receive 5.5% of their
    claim in cash, or payment of their claim in full up to C$10,000.

--  Certain unsecured creditors of MBAC received a combination of Common
    Shares and restructured debt of MBAC Amalco, in the form of debentures
    ("Debentures"). Debentures mature in ten (10) years and, with respect to
    the principal amount thereof only, are convertible into Common Shares at
    a price per share equal to the greater of: (i) C$25.00; and (ii) if
    applicable, the closing market price of Common Shares on the TSXV for
    the most recent trading day preceding the eleventh business day
    following the date on which Common Shares commence trading on the TSXV,
    subject to TSXV approval. An aggregate of 463,826 Common Shares and
    C$3,691,217.81 in principal amount of Debentures were issued to such
    unsecured creditors. Assuming a conversion price of C$25.00 per Common
    Share, an additional 147,648 Common Shares are issuable on conversion of
    the Debentures.

 As a result of the implementation of the Plan, there are currently 52,154,038 Common Shares issued and outstanding of which 50,198,869 Common Shares, representing 96.25% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares (on an undiluted basis), are beneficially owned, or controlled or directed, directly or indirectly, by the Plan Sponsor. In addition, assuming full conversion of the Debentures, there would be 52,301,686 Common Shares issued and outstanding. The Brazilian Proceedings In connection with the Recapitalization, certain of MBAC's subsidiaries, including its primary operating subsidiary in Brazil, Itafos Mineracao S.A., as well as MBAC Fertilizantes S.A. and MBAC Desenvolvimento S.A. (collectively, the "Brazilian Restructuring Entities") commenced parallel extrajudicial restructuring proceedings under applicable restructuring laws in Brazil (the "Brazilian Proceedings") seeking to implement a reorganization plan (the "Brazilian Plan") entered into by and among MBAC, the Brazilian Restructuring Entities, the Plan Sponsor and its affiliates, and Alpha Fundo de Investimento em Participacoes. MBAC is an intervener in the Brazilian Proceedings. On May 16, 2016, the Brazilian Court issued a decision which, among other things, granted a 180 day stay period and directed the publication of a public announcement to notify the Brazilian Restructuring Entities' unsecured creditors of the deadline to object to the Brazilian Proceedings. Certain objections were filed in connection with the Brazilian Proceedings and were rejected by the Brazilian Court, which confirmed the Brazilian Plan. Generally, and pursuant to applicable bankruptcy laws in Brazil, such appeals neither stay the proceedings nor prevent the implementation of the Brazilian Plan. It is anticipated that the Brazilian Plan will be implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a result of the Brazilian Proceedings, certain unsecured creditors of the Brazilian Restructuring Entities will receive either a combination of (i) restructured debt ("Brazilian Debentures") of the respective Brazilian Restructuring Entity; and (ii) warrants of the respective Brazilian Restructuring Entity ("Warrants") or, in the alternative, cash. Brazilian Debentures and Warrants are exercisable into preferred shares of the applicable Brazilian Restructuring Entity, which preferred shares may then be exchanged for up to 1,074,965 Common Shares. Information Concerning MBAC Amalco Following Implementation of the Plan The following table shows the effect of the Plan on MBAC Amalco's consolidated debt structure. Unaudited Pre-Plan and Unaudited Pro Forma (as at June 30, 2016) Debt Structure Enclosed with this press release is an unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position of MBAC Amalco as at June 30, 2016 after giving effect to the Plan.

Additionally, new plans were established to provide for the issuance of deferred share units and restricted share units, respectively. Options may be issued to specified officers and members of management of MBAC Amalco and its affiliates for up to 5% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares at an exercise price based upon the market price of Common Shares ten (10) business days after Common Shares commence trading on the TSXV.

 MBAC Fertilizer Corp Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Unaudited Pro Forma Statement of Financial Position This unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position of MBAC Fertilizer Corp. (the "Company") includes pro forma adjustments illustrating the impact that the specific terms of the plan of compromise and arrangement pursuant to the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (the "Plan of Arrangement") will have on the Company's financial position. These adjustments are for illustrative purposes only, have not been audited, should not be considered comprehensive and may differ significantly from the actual adjustments that may result from the approved Plan of Arrangement in the future. This unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position should be read in conjunction with: 1.  the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the years
    ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (and accompanying notes and related
    management discussion and analysis);
2.  the June 30, 2016 consolidated interim financial statements (and
    accompanying notes and related management discussion and analysis); and
3.  the press release of the Company dated October 27, 2016 that details the
    implementation of the Plan of Arrangement.

 The Company's financial statements on a future date giving effect to the Plan of Arrangement may differ significantly from the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 (and accompanying notes and related management discussion and analysis) and this unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position. The following are the events and transactions reflected in this unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position: 1.  The implementation of the Plan of Arrangement, including the exchange of
    secured and unsecured debt for shares by the creditors of the Company.
2.  The contribution of Zaff LLC's (the "Plan Sponsor") holdings in GB
    Minerals Ltd ("GBL"), a TSXV-listed phosphate exploration company, and
    Stonegate Agricom Ltd. ("Stonegate"), a TSX-listed phosphate exploration
    company.

 Other than those transactions described above, the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at June 30, 2016 does not give effect to transactions occurring after June 30, 2016. The events and transactions will be accounted for on the basis of events and circumstances at the implementation date of the Plan of Arrangement (the "Effective Date"). In conjunction with the implementation of the Plan of Arrangement, certain liabilities and equity classified as "Accounts payable and accrued liabilities", "Notes payable", "Option component of convertible notes", "Share capital" and "Deficit" on the Company's unaudited interim condensed consolidated statement of financial position as at June 30, 2016 are subject to recapitalization. Plan of Arrangement Pro Forma Adjustments In conjunction with the implementation of the Plan of Arrangement, adjustments to the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of financial position are as follows: 1.  Compromise of Company Debt: As a result of the Plan of Arrangement and
    reorganization proceedings in Brazil, secured and unsecured creditors
    will receive either cash (up to allowed limits) or shares.

2.  Acquisition of Assets by the Company: In connection with implementation
    of the Plan of Arrangement, the Company indirectly acquired:

    a.  all of the shares of GBL beneficially held by the Plan Sponsor at
        the time of closing; and
    b.  all of the shares of Stonegate beneficially held by the Plan Sponsor
        at the time of closing. At the time of implementation of the Plan of
        Arrangement, the Plan Sponsor owned approximately 31.3% of GBL and
        approximately 36.5% of Stonegate.

3.  DIP Financing for Restructuring Costs: The Plan Sponsor has advanced
    funds until the Effective Date and will continue to advance funds to
    allow the Company to meet its ongoing care and maintenance operations
    plus restructuring costs.

But the last really politically meaningful piece of data comes this morning at 8:30 a.m. with the first read on Q3 U.S. growth. Estimates are all over the map from under 2 percent (a welcome headline for Donald Trump) to over 3 percent (a big talking point for Hillary Clinton). The numbers so far this year have been weak with Q1 at just 0.8 percent and Q2 at 1.4 percent. Those tepid figures have allowed Trump and the GOP to argue for a change of course in economic policy. But partly due to the GOP nominee’s inability to stick to a single clear message (along with the many other distractions surrounding his campaign), the state of the economy has not dominated the 2016 campaign the way it might have. Clinton has also been able to point to a steadily dropping unemployment rate and increasing wages as counter points to the sluggish growth numbers. Story Continued Below HFE’s Jim O’Sullivan on what to expect: “We have raised our estimate for Q3 real GDP growth to 3.0 percent at an annual rate from 2.5 percent. … [W]e held off on making a change until we saw the September durable goods report. … [W]e expect a decline in the business-investment-in-equipment component of GDP in the Q3 report. Other components should be more than offsetting, however — most notably consumer spending, exports and inventories. Pantheon’s Ian Shepherdson: “Two entirely separate factors point to significant upside risk to the first estimate of third quarter GDP growth, due today. First, we think it likely that farm inventories will not fall far enough to offset the unprecedented surge in exports of soybeans, which will add some 0.9 percentage points to headline GDP growth. … “We suspect our forecasts for the other components of GDP growth aren't far from the consensus estimates. We look for a 2.7 percent rise in consumption, unchanged fixed investment, excluding housing, and a 1 percent drop in government spending. But if the BEA is very cautious on farm inventories and allows only a partial export offset, and the IVA is in line with the PPI data, then GDP will come in well above the consensus, and it might — might — even reach 4 percent.” CITI ON INFRASTRUCTURE — Donald Trump on Thursday proposed spending $1 trillion on infrastructure. In a new report, Citi suggests even that huge sum is just a small part of the global need: “[G]lobal infrastructure needs will amount to $58.6 trillion over the next 15 years … Yet challenges continue to prevent this capital from being unlocked, including a lack of transparency and data, and political and regulatory instability. “Should these challenges be overcome, the benefits are clear: Per Citi analysis, every 1 percent increase in infrastructure spend will lead to a 1.2 percent growth in GDP. For global GDP growth in 2017 to reach the OECD prediction of 3.8 percent, infrastructure spending must increase by 1 percent of global GDP from 3.4 percent of global GDP to 4.4 percent.” Full report. THE CITY IS STARTING TO BRACE FOR CARNEY'S DEPARTURE — Via POLITICO’s Francesco Guerrera, maestro of the London-based “Morning Exchange” newsletter: “Let me say it at the outset: I don't know whether Mark Carney will decide to leave the helm of the Bank of England in 2018 as planned, or serve out his eight-year term until 2021. But I'm picking up a growing concern in financial circles that the BoE governor might soon say he is leaving in 2018. Some people claim to actually know, others are reading the tea leaves (and Carney's recent pronouncements). Why now? Because Carney has said that he will announce his intentions before the end of the year. And because he has been attacked by Euroskeptic politicians for his alleged siding with the Remain campaign before the referendum. Of late, even Prime Minister Theresa May and Finance Minister Philip Hammond added to the criticism of the BoE's policies, prompting a visibly nonplussed Carney to tell a town hall meeting in Northern England: ‘We will not take instructions on policy from the politicians.’ Read more.

DRIVING THE DAY — Hillary Clinton campaigns in Cedar Rapids and Des Moines, Iowa. President Obama campaigns for Clinton in Orlando … Donald Trump campaigns in Manchester, N.H., Lisbon, Maine (home of one electoral vote) and Cedar Rapids, Iowa … First look at Q3 GDP at 8:30 a.m. expected to show growth of 2.6 percent … Univ. Of Michigan Consumer Sentiment at 10:00 a.m. expected to rise to 88.5 from 87.9. TRUMP OCT. CONTRIBUTION: $31K — Tweet via @kenvogel: “Trump boasted he'd reach $100M in self-funding, but he only gave his campaign $31k this mo. Now at $56.1M total.” FEC report. TOTALS — Trump’s campaign reported $15.9M on hand as of 10/19. Hillary Clinton’s campaign reported $62.4M on hand. Oddly enough, Clinton also apparently gave more to her campaign during the reporting period ($50K) than Trump. TOP TRUMP QUOTES OF THE DAY — To supporters in Toledo, Ohio: "We should just cancel the election and just give it to Trump, right? What are we even having it for? Her policies are so bad." To Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly on polls: “The only one I really like are the ones where I'm winning.” ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: Now delivering: Retirement security for life!

This would be the first major Cabinet candidate to go public for a campaign that’s insisted its focus remains on winning the election, and perhaps the most central choice for a potential president who was a secretary of state herself. “Neither Clinton nor her aides have yet told Biden. According to the source, they’re strategizing about how to make the approach to the vice president, who almost ran against her in the Democratic primaries but has since been campaigning for her at a breakneck pace all over the country in these final months” Read more. DEAL FRENZY DOESN’T PAUSE FOR ELECTION — WSJ’s Dana Cimilluca, Dana Mattioli and David Benoit: “The eve of a presidential election is typically a time when companies put merger plans on hold and wait for clarity on crucial matters like antitrust policy. Not this year. Less than two weeks before voters head to the polls, U.S. companies have unleashed a wave of deals that has made this month the busiest ever for mergers and acquisitions. The deal making culminated inQualcomm Inc.’s agreement Thursday to buy NXP SemiconductorsNV for $39 billion, part of a swirl of consolidation in the semiconductor industry. “The NXP acquisition counts as the second-largest pure technology deal of all time after Dell Inc.’s recent acquisition of EMC Corp. for about $60 billion. And it comes just days after AT&T Inc. struck the biggest takeover deal of the year, with a pact to buy Time Warner Inc.for $85 billion. A day earlier, British American Tobacco PLC made a $47 billion offer to take full control of Reynolds American Inc. in a move that would create the world’s largest listed tobacco company by revenue and market value” Read more. FCC CHOOSES PRIVACY — The Washington Post’s Brian Fung and Craig Timberg: “Federal officials delivered a landmark ruling in favor of online privacy Thursday, limiting how Internet providers use and sell customer data, while asserting that customers have a right to control their personal information. “Under the Federal Communications Commission’s new rules, consumers may forbid Internet providers from sharing sensitive personal information, such as app and browsing histories, mobile location data and other information generated while using the Internet.” Read more. AMAZON SLIPS — FT’s Hannah Kuchler: “Amazon shares fell 6 per cent in after-hours trading in New York on Thursday when the online retailer significantly missed earnings expectations in the third quarter, and forecast operating income of as little as zero next quarter. “Investment in distribution warehouses, video content from top tier directors and actors and the engineering teams behind virtual assistant Alexa helped push operating costs up 29 per cent — and look set to continue into the holiday shopping season.” Read more. DEUTSCHE BOUNCES BACK — NYT’s Chad Bray and Landon Thomas Jr.: “The bank, Germany’s largest, said on Thursday that it had returned to a profit in the third quarter and was making progress in its efforts to turn around the business. Analysts expected a loss for the quarter. “In addition, Deutsche Bank, which also has big trading operations in New York and London, said that its capital position had improved, with its Tier 1 capital ratio edging up to 11.1 percent, from 10.8 percent.” Read more. CETA GETS A SECOND LIFE — POLITICO EU’s Christian Oliver and Simon Marks: “Belgium’s regional governments have granted a temporary stay of execution to the European Commission’s trade policy by agreeing at the 11th-hour to support a landmark EU deal with Canada. “Belgium’s Prime Minister Charles Michel announced on Thursday that days of marathon talks between the federal government and regional leaders had finally paid dividends and that it would be possible to win backing for the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement from the rebel assemblies: Wallonia, Wallonia-Brussels and Brussels.” Read more. NCUA ALLOWS CREDIT UNION EXPANSION — POLITICO’s Victoria Guida: “The National Credit Union Administration Thursday approved a final rule that would further expand the potential for credit unions to serve a wider population of customers, in a move that is rankling community banks “While credit unions are cheering the move as long-awaited relief from restrictions on who they can sign on as members, community banks have criticized the rule as outside the scope of the Federal Credit Union Act, which gives credit unions tax-exempt status.” Read more. TWITTER KILLS VINE — The Washington Post’s Andrea Peterson: “Twitter announced Thursday that it's shutting down Vine, a social network that lets users create and share short-form videos, ‘in the coming months.’ “The decision to shutter Vine comes as Twitter is in a state of flux after weeks of rumors about a possible sale. On Thursday, the company also announced a restructuring that will cut 9 percent of its workforce. It's unclear whether members of the Vine team will be included in the layoffs.” Read more. GE IN TALKS WITH BAKER HUGHES — WSJ’s Dana Mattioli, Kate Linebaugh and Joann S. Lublin: “General Electric Co. is in talks to buy Baker Hughes Inc., according to people familiar with the matter, a transaction that would be the biggest in the history of the industrial giant and extend its bet on the battered oil industry. “With a market value of $23 billion, Houston-based Baker Hughes could go for more than $30 billion in a takeover, given the typical premium. GE has a market value of $259 billion.” Read more. ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR — BANK TRADES RIP NCUA — ABA’s Rob Nichols: “We’re deeply concerned about NCUA’s decision to go beyond its statutory authority to move credit unions even further away from the common bonds that define their missions” ICBA’s Cam Fine emails: “What the NCUA did today was eviscerate the common bond statute by allowing all air breathing mammals to join credit unions. Credit unions are tax-free institutions and were never meant to operate as the functional equivalent of commercial banks. “They don’t pay one dime in Federal or state taxes. The growth of the credit union industry is on the backs of American taxpayers and thousands of communities across the nation who rely on tax-paying community banks to fund their local schools, fire halls, hospitals, and community infrastructure.” NAFCU DEFENDS — Executive Vice President of Government Affairs & General Counsel Carrie Hunt: “NAFCU continues to hear from our members that NCUA’s current FOM rules and regulations have unnecessarily inhibited their ability to serve their communities. Additionally, NAFCU members believe that the federal credit union charter must keep pace with changes in state laws, technology, and the progressiveness of the financial services industry” ADS HIT GOP MEMBERS OVER WALL STREET — Per release: “Today, the Working Families Party launched new 30-second TV ads that slams three Republican members of the House Financial Services Committee for putting Wall Street ahead of working families … The ad takes aim at Reps. Scott Garrett (NJ-05), Sean Duffy (WI-07) and French Hill (AR-02) over a recent vote in the Financial Services Committee for a bill (HR 5983) which would roll back financial regulations” CARLYLE PIVOTS AWAY FROM HEDGE FUNDS — NYT’s Alexandra Stevenson: “Prominent public pension funds have turned their backs on hedge funds, and so have a few big insurance companies. Now, one of the world’s biggest private equity firms, the Carlyle Group, is walking away, too. Carlyle told investors this week that it was pivoting away from its hedge fund investments, once worth $15 billion. “Speaking to investors, the Carlyle co-founder William E. Conway Jr. said the firm’s performance in hedge funds did not meet the expectations of its investors. ‘And when our performance falls short, it is critical for both our fund investors and for the firm that we deal with the consequences,’ Mr. Conway said.” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: As traditional pensions have disappeared, American workers have become more responsible for saving and preparing for their retirements. With longer lifespans, this often means saving for a longer retirement. These challenges have made planning and saving for retirement more difficult. But what if all Americans could get paychecks for life? Policymakers can help make this possible by supporting policies that encourage saving, make workplace retirement plans more broadly available, and facilitate access to lifetime income strategies. Let’s send Americans retirement security.

JPMorgan beat analyst expectations this month, announcing fixed income revenues were up 48 percent on the year. Goldman Sachs crushed estimates, reporting that its fixed income, currency and commodities trading was the main driver, increasing 34 percent on year. The same happened for Citigroup and Bank of America and European lenders, such as Barclays, have followed suit. And this trend could be set to continue, according to Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank. "It is possible that banks' profits will continue to be supported by fixed income. The increase in volatility may support the number of transactions and could lead to higher profitability for banks," she told CNBC. Foley defends that political uncertainty in 2017 will lead to more volatility in bond markets. The uncertainty regarding the U.S. election might soon evaporate, but Europe faces key elections – including in Germany, France and the Netherlands, where rising support for nationalist parties is becoming stronger. Getty Images Janet Yellen Expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will again raise interest rates and potential changes to global inflation might also increase the odds of market volatility. This comes after bonds, which are perceived as a safe haven, have once again been back in favor this year with the German government bund yield falling below zero a few months ago. Yields move inversely to bond prices. "Fixed income trading will continue to drive investment bank profitability (into 2017), as the new bond issuance calendar looks strong. M&A (merger and acquisition)-related issuance as well as corporates extending their debt maturity profile seems like it will continue, especially ahead of further U.S. interest rate increases," Shilen Shah, a bond strategist at Investec, told CNBC. Fed officials have given indications that a second rate hike this year could take place in December. However, in Europe, there are no interest hikes on the horizon, with the ECB (European Central Bank) expected to keep its monetary policy loose. "Divergence (in) interest rate policy could potentially be a catalyst for more volatility in bond markets," Shah said. "If inflation expectations increase, driven for example by a higher oil price, some of the deflationary pressures on bond yields could be reserved. Increased bond market volatility is most likely to benefit those banks with large fixed-income flow businesses, as they are likely to see higher trading volume."

Published Oct 27th, 2016 4:27 pm staff2@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas Editor’s note: Each Thursday, Talk Business & Politics provides “Startup Talk,” a round-up of startup, technology and entrepreneurial news. ––––––––––––––– JPMORGAN COMMITS $75 MILLION TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR WOMEN, MINORITIES AND VETERAN-OWNED STARTUPS JPMorgan Chase said it is more than doubling the size of its global Small Business Forward program by committing $75 million over the next three years to support women, minority and veteran-owned small businesses. This includes a $1.9 million grant to the Association for Enterprise Opportunity (AEO) to support its programs to connect small business owners with alternative funding sources when they are unable to qualify for traditional loans. According to JPMorgan, small businesses are growing fastest among people of color, particularly Latinas and African American women. Yet, despite their importance to the economy, research shows minority-owned businesses rely significantly more on investments of personal or family wealth than on outside debt or equity. Launched in 2014, Small Business Forward is a global initiative developed by JPMorgan Chase to support small businesses with the potential to grow, offer quality employment, and create economic opportunity for vulnerable populations and their communities by facilitating access to flexible capital; seeding innovative new funds with trusted partners that support underrepresented businesses; extending entrepreneurial support systems to underserved entrepreneurs and neighborhoods; and expanding opportunities for diverse, women, and veteran founders within high-growth sectors. GLOBAL PHONE SHIPMENTS GREW 6% IN 3Q, SAMSUNG LEADS DESPITE GALAXY NOTE 7 RECALL Global smartphone shipments grew 6% annually to reach 375 million units in the third quarter, according to the latest research from Strategy Analytics. Samsung maintained first position with 20% global smartphone market share, while China-based OPPO grew 140% annually and was the standout performer. Samsung shipped 75.3 million smartphones worldwide in Q3 2016, falling 10% annually from 83.8 million units in Q3 2015. This was Samsung’s slowest growth rate for almost two years as market share has dipped from 24% percent to 20% in the past year as the Galaxy Note 7 recall dented its brand image and left a large product gap in its premium smartphone lineup. Samsung will now be looking to its next flagship launch, such as the rumored Galaxy S8 model, to recover momentum in 2017. Apple fell 5% annually and shipped a lackluster 45.5 million smartphones worldwide in Q3 2016. Apple’s global smartphone market share has softened from 14% to 12% in the past year. Apple has been given a slight boost by Samsung’s Note 7 missteps, but it continues to face iPhone fatigue among many consumers in major regions such as China and Europe. Huawei maintained third position with 9% global smartphone market share in the third quarter, up from 8% a year ago. Huawei’s smartphone growth rate has more than halved, to 26% annually in Q3 2016, compared with 62% annual growth in Q3 2015. Huawei is facing intense competition from OPPO, Vivo and other emerging Chinese rivals such as fast-growing LeEco. REPORT: 88% OF EMPLOYEES LACK THE AWARENESS NEEDED TO PREVENT COMMON CYBER INCIDENTS The results of a new survey testing employee data privacy and cybersecurity knowledge reveal that 88% lack the awareness to stop preventable cyber incidents. In “The 2016 State of Privacy and Security Awareness Report,” MediaPro revealed employee knowledge trends across eight risk domains, ranging from working remotely to identifying phishing attempts, and assigned three risk profiles indicating employees’ privacy and security awareness IQ. These risk profiles are Risk, Novice, and Hero, and are based on the number of proper behaviors correctly identified. The more correct behaviors an employee can identify, the less of a privacy or security risk they represent. Key findings show that 72% of respondents were given a “Novice” profile, meaning they understand the basics but are dangerously close to one wrong decision or mistake leading to a security or privacy incident. Nearly 40% of respondents chose to discard a potential password hint in an unsecure manner rather than disposing of it by secure means. MediaPro surveyed more than 1,000 employees across the U.S. to quantify the current state of privacy and security awareness. For the full results of the survey and to view an infographic, visit here.

REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK NEW YORK A Florida man pleaded guilty on Thursday to obstructing a regulatory examination of a credit union linked to an illegal bitcoin exchange owned by an Israeli accused of being behind hacking attacks on companies including JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N). Michael Murgio, 66, admitted in Manhattan federal court he drafted a letter in 2014 with a false statement that was sent to the National Credit Union Administration during an examination of the New Jersey-based credit union. "When I did this, I knew what I was doing was wrong," Murgio said. Under a plea deal, Murgio, a former member of the Palm Beach County School Board, agreed not to appeal any prison sentence of 16 months or less. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 27. Murgio was indicted in April, becoming one of eight people to face charges following an investigation connected to a data breach that JPMorgan disclosed in 2014 involving records for more than 83 million accounts. Among those charged was his son, Anthony Murgio, who prosecutors say operated Coin.mx, an unlicensed bitcoin exchange owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli accused of orchestrating a massive hacking scheme involving JPMorgan and other companies. Prosecutors contend Shalon along with another Israeli, Ziv Orenstein, and an American, Joshua Samuel Aaron, ran a criminal enterprise that hacked into a dozen companies' networks, stealing the personal information of over 100 million customers. While the Murgios were not accused of roles in the hacking offenses, prosecutors said they committed crimes linked to the operation of Coin.mx, which exchanged millions of dollars of the virtual currency bitcoin for customers. Prosecutors said that beginning in 2013, Anthony Murgio operated Coin.mx, with the assistance of others including Florida resident Yuri Lebedev. To evade scrutiny of Coin.mx, they acquired control in 2014 of the now-defunct Helping Other People Excel Federal Credit Union of Jackson, New Jersey, by paying $150,000 in bribes to its chairman, pastor Trevon Gross, an indictment said. Michael Murgio's guilty plea was the second in the case. Jose Freundt, another Florida resident who according to his lawyers worked for Coin.mx briefly, pleaded guilty to various charges on Oct. 13 and agreed to cooperate with authorities. Anthony Murgio, Lebedev and Gross have pleaded not guilty. They are scheduled to face trial in February. Shalon and Orenstein pleaded not guilty following their extradition from Israel in June. Aaron is currently in Russia. The case is U.S. v. Murgio, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00769.

Greff sees Norwegian as having relatively attractive EPS growth in 2017, though driven primarily by capacity. At the same, the analyst also cautioned that the company possesses the most EPS risk due to soft pricing in Europe and the Caribbean, where it has more exposure. “CCL trades at a valuation premium to both NCLH and RCL, reflective of its relatively better Europe exposure, its solid balance sheet position and dividend yield, in our view. We view RCL’s risk-reward as in between CCL and NCLH,” Greff continued. Greff pointed out at fewer North American passengers traveling to European destinations, capacity challenges in Caribbean, while price discipline hurting near term occupancy and onboard. On Royal Caribbean, the analyst is concerned over declining net yields from China coupled with the ongoing weakness in Europe and potential over-supply in the Caribbean. For Carnival, apart from rich valuation, the analyst said the company is pressured by slowing GDP growth, terrorism and Zika, along with ongoing near-term challenges in driving net ticket yields. These challenges offset the company’s strengths including leading market share, diversification potential and scale opportunities. Greff also slashed his price targets for all the three stocks. The target price for Royal Caribbean being cut to $73 from $96, Norwegian to $44 from $62 and Carnival to $46 from $58. Each of the three experienced negative investor reaction Thursday. At last check: Carnival was down 1.68 percent at $46.36. Norwegian was down 5.08 percent at $36.04. Royal Caribbean was down 2.86 percent at $67.90.

James Passeri Oct 27, 2016 12:17 PM EDT Shares of Royal Caribbean ( RCL) were lower Thursday after analysts with JPMorgan downgraded the cruise line to NEUTRAL from OVERWEIGHT. The analysts cited weakness in the European markets and rising supply in China and put a $73 price target on Royal Caribbean stock. Royal Caribbean shares have fallen sharply in 2016, prompting about a third of the company's market cap to vanish. Analysts with Jefferson Research recently saying the company deserves a BUY rating on the basis of improving operating efficiency and strong cash flow, which the analysts say could be the "ultimate measure of company performance and more reliable than reported earnings."

Treasury Secretary. 3.) NEC Director 4.) CEA Chair. We’ll give you an example for each. These are not predictions. Just a template. One scenario under Clinton could be … Chief of Staff: Neera Tanden. Treasury Secretary: Roger Ferguson. NEC Director: Brian Deese. CEA Chair: Joe Stiglitz. Story Continued Below Under Trump … Chief of Staff: Newt Gingrich. Treasury Secretary: Glenn Hubbard. NEC Director: Larry Kudlow. CEA Chair: John Paulson. Email your picks to me at bwhite@politico.com. SPEAKING OF DREAM TEAMS — Via Beacon Policy Advisors: “We expect [Clinton] to keep her closest friends and advisors at the White House — some because they are unconfirmable given progressives' resistance (such as Tom Nides) and some because they will be more valuable to her as experienced insiders (such as John Podesta and Neera Tanden). … Huma Abedin … will remain by Clinton’s side in the White House … “Jake Sullivan is Clinton’s whiz kid policy wonk … will likely stick to the Clinton White House, where he could take the lead on foreign policy, or choose to pursue a larger portfolio that includes domestic policy. … Cheryl Mills … will likely take a senior role in the White House. … Phillipe Reines … is too aggressive to serve as Clinton’s official press secretary … but he will be her message shaper behind the scenes.” THREE PERCENT-PLUS GDP AHEAD? — Looks like Friday’s first look at Q3 GDP could be a significant political moment. A reading of three percent or more would offer Hillary Clinton a powerful closing argument weapon and refute some of Donald Trump’s complaining about “1 percent growth.” Pantheon’s Ian Shepherdson: “Trade boosted Q3 growth … The advance September trade numbers were supported by very high soybean exports, for the third straight month, as we expected, but the big story was the unexpected sharp drop in imports of both capital goods, down 3.6 percent, and consumer goods, down 1.8 percent. “With exports rising 0.9 percent, stronger than expected, the overall trade deficit substantially undershot the consensus forecast. … [T]he September trade numbers substantially increase the chance that third quarter growth exceeded 3 percent.” CLINTON WILL “CLOSELY FOLLOW” AT&T MERGER — CNN’s Brian Stelter: “Hillary Clinton says she will ‘closely’ follow AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner as the deal comes under regulatory scrutiny in Washington. The Justice Department's antitrust division will analyze the deal in the months ahead. The Federal Communications Commission may also take a look. There will be Congressional hearings too. The $85 billion deal was announced over the weekend. Clinton's campaign indicated that she had questions about the … but she didn't comment directly until Wednesday afternoon, when reporters asked about it during a Q&A session. “‘I think it raises questions and concerns and they should be looked into,’ she said, towing a common Democratic line about big business mergers. Clinton said she had heard that Congress ‘will start having bipartisan hearings’ about the deal, ‘which I think is appropriate.’ … ‘So I am going to follow it closely, and obviously if I am fortunate enough to be president, I will expect the government to conduct a very thorough analysis before making a decision,’ she said.” Read more. MORE PRESSURE ON BRAINARD — HuffPo’s Zachary Carter: “[Lael] Brainard’s record on trade is certain to ignite the ire of the Bernie Sanders base. When she joined Bill Clinton’s administration in 1997, Brainard helped implement [NAFTA] and manage China’s entrance on the stage of global commerce as a member of the World Trade Organization. “As the top diplomat at Treasury under .. Obama, Brainard advocated for disappointing trade pacts with South Korea, Colombia and Panama, and laid the groundwork for much of what eventually became the TPP” Read more. INSIDE BILL CLINTON INC. — POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein: “As a longtime Bill Clinton adviser came under fire several years ago for alleged conflicts of interest involving a private consulting firm and the Clinton Foundation, he mounted an audacious defense: Bill Clinton's doing it, too. The unusual and brash rejoinder from veteran Clinton aide and Teneo Consulting co-founder Doug Band is scattered across the thousands of hacked emails published by WikiLeaks … “[B]ut a memo released Wednesday provides the most-detailed look to date at the intertwined worlds of nonprofit, for-profit, official and political activities involving Clinton and many of his top aides. The memo at one point refers bluntly to the money-making part of Clinton’s life as ‘Bill Clinton Inc.’ and notes that in at least one case a company — global education firm Laureate International Universities — began paying Clinton personally after first being a donor to the Clinton Foundation” Read more.

DRIVING THE DAY — Hillary Clinton campaigns with Michelle Obama in Winston-Salem, N.C. … Donald Trump campaigns in Springfield, Toledo and Geneva, Ohio … Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will be in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. MORGAN STANLEY SETS OFF RETIRMENT ACCOUNT FIGHT — WSJ’s Michael Wursthorn: “Morgan Stanley will let its retirement brokerage customers keep commission-based accounts once new government conflict rules take effect, a move directly opposite the approach that its biggest rival on Wall Street, Merrill Lynch, is taking. … Under the move, Morgan Stanley will allow its nearly 16,000 brokers to use an exemption under the so-called fiduciary rule to continue offering individual retirement accounts that charge investors for each transaction made. “The fiduciary rule, drafted by the Labor Department and set to start taking effect in April, requires brokers to put the interests of retirement savers ahead of their own and firms to justify varying levels of compensation in IRAs. Morgan Stanley's decision differs from Bank of America Corp.-owned brokerage Merrill Lynch, which earlier this month said it planned a wholesale exit from the industry's traditional commission-based sales model in retirement accounts” Read more. HRC TO PARTY AT JAVITZ — POLITICO’s Jake Sherman: “Hillary Clinton's election night celebration will be at the Jacob K. Javits Center on the West Side of Manhattan. Clinton's campaign sent out a ‘save the date’ to offices on Capitol Hill alerting lawmakers and their aides about the event, noting that they will be sending out ‘additional information shortly.’ The email came from Clinton's ‘political team’ and it said ‘we wanted your boss to be the first to know’ about the plans” Read more. LEFT WANTS TO NAME A REG CZAR — POLITICO’s Ben Weyl: “Progressives are waging a behind-the-scenes campaign to install their preferred ‘regulatory czar’ in a Hillary Clinton administration, floating people who would forcefully use the president's executive powers to advance a liberal agenda. The effort underscores the heightened interest in a typically obscure post that will be especially important if Republicans hold onto Congress and Clinton must enact her domestic policies through the federal agencies she controls. “Lisa Heinzerling and David Vladeck, two Georgetown Law professors who have frequently criticized the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for failing to act aggressively, are among some progressives' top picks to lead that office, multiple activists tell POLITICO.” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: Now delivering: Retirement security for life! We know saving for retirement can be difficult, but policymakers can help by supporting policies to encourage saving, make retirement plans more widely available, and facilitate access to lifetime income strategies. Let’s send Americans paychecks for life. Learn more at: http://irionline.org/agenda. ** CLINTON TO LIMIT LOBBYISTS — POLITICO’s Anna Palmer and Andrew Restuccia: “Hillary Clinton’s presidential transition team has put in place strict rules that limit the influence of lobbyists in crafting the nominee’s policy agenda, POLITICO has learned, an early indication that Clinton is unlikely to abandon all of the lobbying restrictions imposed by Barack Obama. “The secretive transition operation, which has tried to keep a low profile in order to not appear overly confident in a Clinton victory, is limiting how federal lobbyists can work with the transition teams that are tasked with planning for the transfer of power at dozens of key agencies … The Clinton campaign's policy operation, which is a separate entity from the transition team, continues to be the point of contact for companies, consultants and lobbyists to send policy memos” Read more. FINANCE TRADE ASSOCIATIONS PUSH TPP — Eight major financial services trade associations have signed a letter urging congressional leadership to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership this year: “The TPP is a strong agreement which modernizes rules that will enable our member companies to support global value chains, to help expand participation by small and medium-sized enterprises in the Asia-Pacific region and to deliver quality banking, insurance and securities services to consumers and clients … “A failure to act on TPP this year will have real consequences and it is entirely possible that the other parties to the agreement will move ahead without us.” Read the letter. AMAZON’S GROCERY LIST — Business Insider’s Eugene Kim: “Amazon wants to open 20 brick-and-mortar grocery stores over the next two years and the online retailer believes the US market has room for up to 2,000 of its Amazon Fresh-branded grocery stores over the next decade, Business Insider has learned. “The company wants to experiment with different versions of stores during the pilot program. Ten of the grocery stores will be "click-and-collect" drive-up spots for Amazon customers to pick up their online orders. The other 10 will be traditional stores where cart-pushing shoppers can stroll the aisles, touching, smelling and inspecting produce and other goods for themselves.” Read more. SHARING IS CARING — Reuters’ Jessica Toonkel and David Shepardson: “Media companies plan to ask U.S. regulators to force AT&T Inc and Time Warner Inc to share their trove of customer data if the telecom and content companies merge, fearing the combined behemoth would have an unfair advantage selling targeted mobile advertising, a handful of media executives told Reuters this week. “AT&T's proposed $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner would give the media company's networks, such as HBO, Cinemax and Turner, potentially unprecedented data about viewers who have AT&T cell phones and DirecTV accounts.” Read more. WELLS’ MEA CULPA — AP’s Ken Sweet: “Newly appointed Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan told employees Tuesday that he is "sorry for the pain" that the bank's employees have suffered as a result of the company's sales practices scandal. Sloan's company-wide speech, given Tuesday in Charlotte, North Carolina, is the latest effort by Wells Fargo's executives to atone for the fact that the bank's employees, pushed to the limit by impossible sales goals, opened as many as 2 million bank and credit card accounts without customers' authorization.” Read more. SENATE DEMS CALL FOR CLAWBACKS — LATimes’ James Rufus Koren: “On Wednesday, 16 Senate Democrats asked financial regulators to further tighten the proposed rules by forcing Wells Fargo and other banks to claw back executive pay when such misconduct occurs. “The senators, led by Robert Menendez of New Jersey, said allowing banks themselves to decide whether executives get to keep pay does not do enough to curtail the kind of wrongdoing uncovered at Wells Fargo, where thousands of employees created as many as 2 million accounts for customers without their authorization.” Read more. SNAPCHAT SEEKS $4 BILLION IPO — “Snapchat will seek to raise as much as $4 billion in its planned initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter. “The IPO could value Snapchat at about $25 billion to $35 billion, the people said, asking not to be identified as the details aren’t public. No final decision has been made and the size of the IPO may change, they said. The valuation could reach as much as $40 billion, one of the people said.” Read more. TESLA TURNS A PROFIT — WSJ’s Tim Higgins: “Tesla Motors Inc. posted a surprise $22 million profit in its latest period, buoyed by record sales of its pricey electric cars and boosting Chief Executive Elon Musk’s plan to sharply lift output ahead of its release of a sedan to compete against mass-market rivals. “The quarter’s profit — a record and only the second time ever — was driven higher by improved sales of the Model S sedan and Model X sport-utility vehicle, a reduction in spending and a boost from selling pollution tax credits to other auto makers.” Read more. VENZEULA ON THE BRINK — FT’s John Paul Rathbone: “Venezuela's opposition stepped up its dispute with the socialist government on Wednesday with mass street protests, calls for a general strike on Friday and a fresh march on the presidential palace next week if the administration does not allow a constitutionally-allowed referendum against President Nicolás Maduro to proceed. “Mercosur, the South American trade pact that includes Brazil and Argentina, is considering expelling Venezuela for its democratic failings. Luis Almagro, head of the Organization of American States, this week called Venezuela ‘a dictatorship’.” Read more. HOLDING WALL ST ACCOUNTABLE — POLITICO’S Victoria Guida: “The special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program is proposing to make it easier to charge bank executives when fraudulent activity occurs at their institution. “Christy Goldsmith Romero, in SIGTARP’s quarterly report to Congress, recommends that Congress require senior bank officials to sign an annual certification that they have done their due diligence to determine that there is no criminal conduct or civil fraud happening at their institution.” Read more. HUMANS NEED NOT APPLY — NYT’s Nathaniel Popper: “This week Bank of America, MasterCard and several financial start-ups announced new tools — known as chatbots — that will allow customers to ask questions about their financial accounts, initiate transactions and get financial advice via text messages or services like Facebook Messenger and Amazon’s Echo tower. “Many companies are betting that automated bots — both in text messaging and voice-activated form — could become the dominant interface of the future, surpassing phone apps and websites as the way to reach consumers.” Read more. ALSO FOR YOUR RADAR — GOOLSBEE JOINS ANALYSIS GROUP — Per release: “Analysis Group, one of the largest economics consulting firms in North America, welcomes Austan Goolsbee, former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for the Obama Administration and a member of the President’s cabinet, as Academic Affiliate. … “Well known for his work shaping U.S. tax and economic policy, Dr. Goolsbee has held other key roles in the Obama administration over the past two terms, including serving on the Panel of Economic Advisers to the Congressional Budget Office, on the U.S. Census Advisory Commission, and as a special consultant for Internet Policy to the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice” WALL STREET FUNDS CHARTER SCHOOL MEASURE — Via IBT: “Wall St firms are evading the SEC pay to play law to use profits off teacher pensions to finance the most expensive charter school ballot measure in American history.” Read more. NEW GSE POST — Treasury’s Antonio Weiss and Karen Dynan write on Medium that “affordability and access [are] central to GSE reform.” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: As traditional pensions have disappeared, American workers have become more responsible for saving and preparing for their retirements. With longer lifespans, this often means saving for a longer retirement. These challenges have made planning and saving for retirement more difficult. But what if all Americans could get paychecks for life? Policymakers can help make this possible by supporting policies that encourage saving, make workplace retirement plans more broadly available, and facilitate access to lifetime income strategies.

Stefan Oschmann, however, who took over as Merck's CEO earlier this year, has been focussed on finding ways to safeguard his company's leading position in the multiple sclerosis market. Its top selling drug in this space is Rebif. Merck has hired investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to sound out potential buyers for the biosimilar business, the people said on Friday. There is no guarantee that the discussions will result in any deal, they added.Merck's biosimilars business could be worth as much as $1 billion because of its long-term sales potential, the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Merck, which is independent of U.S. drug marker Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N), declined to comment. A JPMorgan spokeswoman offered no immediate comment. Merck's biosimilar business includes a drug in advanced clinical trials that is a competitor to AbbVie Inc's (ABBV.N) popular arthritis treatment Humira. The unit also has several early-stage compounds. Merck is facing off against several larger competitors, including Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Novartis AG (NOVN.S), both of which have won regulatory approval for biosimilar drugs. Biosimilars have become an increasing area of focus for investors and industry executives in the past year, as regulators have begun approving a handful of compounds in the United States.Biosimilars are more complex than traditional drugs, requiring genetically engineered proteins. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration was not allowed to consider generic versions of biologic drugs until U.S. President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010. So far, the FDA has approved four biosimilar drugs, most recently a competitor for Humira made by Amgen Inc (AMGN.O). There are more than 60 biosimilars awaiting approval. More of those drugs are expected to be approved in the coming years, as biologic drugs representing more than $30 billion in sales will lose their patent protection between now and 2020, according to data from IMS Health. In Europe, where biosimilars were approved by regulators as early as 2006, more than 21 biosimilars made by 14 companies have been approved.

Home Mail Search News Cricket Movies Lifestyle Celebrity Flickr Mobile Answers More Yahoo Search Search Mail News Home Follow us National World US Elections Finance Cricket Lifestyle Sports Good News Videos Autos Exclusive - Germany's Merck explores sale of biosimilar drug business: sources By Carl O'Donnell and Greg Roumeliotis28 October 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Share By Carl O'Donnell and Greg Roumeliotis (Reuters) - German chemicals and pharmaceuticals company Merck KGaA is exploring a sale of its biosimilars unit, according to people familiar with the matter, as that business faces fierce competition from larger players in the sector. Biosimilars, the biotechnology-based equivalents of generic drugs, have become increasingly popular amid a drive to curb price increases. Stefan Oschmann, however, who took over as Merck's CEO earlier this year, has been focussed on finding ways to safeguard his company's leading position in the multiple sclerosis market. Its top selling drug in this space is Rebif. Merck has hired investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co to sound out potential buyers for the biosimilar business, the people said on Friday. There is no guarantee that the discussions will result in any deal, they added. Merck's biosimilars business could be worth as much as $1 billion because of its long-term sales potential, the people said. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Merck, which is independent of U.S. drug marker Merck & Co Inc , declined to comment. A JPMorgan spokeswoman offered no immediate comment. Merck's biosimilar business includes a drug in advanced clinical trials that is a competitor to AbbVie Inc's popular arthritis treatment Humira. The unit also has several early-stage compounds. Merck is facing off against several larger competitors, including Pfizer Inc and Novartis AG , both of which have won regulatory approval for biosimilar drugs. Biosimilars have become an increasing area of focus for investors and industry executives in the past year, as regulators have begun approving a handful of compounds in the United States. Biosimilars are more complex than traditional drugs, requiring genetically engineered proteins. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration was not allowed to consider generic versions of biologic drugs until U.S. President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010. So far, the FDA has approved four biosimilar drugs, most recently a competitor for Humira made by Amgen Inc . There are more than 60 biosimilars awaiting approval. More of those drugs are expected to be approved in the coming years, as biologic drugs representing more than $30 billion in sales will lose their patent protection between now and 2020, according to data from IMS Health. In Europe, where biosimilars were approved by regulators as early as 2006, more than 21 biosimilars made by 14 companies have been approved.

Eberhardt Tepin Print Email Facebook Twitter Comment While Tepin is in a different spot this year compared with last year going into the Breeders' Cup Mile (gr. IT), in terms of her most recent race outcome, trainer Mark Casse is confident the champion turf mare can deliver another winning result. Tepin was one of five horses trained by Casse being pointed to Breeders' Cup races who completed workouts Oct. 28 at Churchill Downs. Casse said all five, a group that also includes grade I winners Classic Empire and Victory to Victory, appeared to come out of the works in good order and are ready to ship to Santa Anita Park for the Nov. 4 and Nov. 5 races. Casse planned an easy breeze for Tepin Friday and the 5-year-old Bernstein mare delivered, completing four furlongs in :49 as she finished serious preparation toward defending her victory in last year's Mile. The other four Breeders' Cup workers for Casse on Friday also enjoyed easy moves. Claiborne Breeders' Futurity (gr. I) winner Classic Empire breezed four furlongs in :50 as the Pioneerof the Nile   colt prepares for the Sentient Jet Breeders' Cup Juvenile (gr. I); Natalma Stakes (Can-IT) winner Victory to Victory completed a half-mile in :48 2/5 as the Exchange Rate   filly readies for the Juvenile Fillies Turf (gr. IT); Dixiana Bourbon Stakes (gr. IIIT) winner Keep Quiet completed four furlongs in :50 as the Elusive City colt works toward the Juvenile Turf (gr. IT); and JP Morgan Chase Jessamine Stakes (gr. IIIT) winner La Coronel breezed four furlongs in :47 4/5 as the Colonel John   filly prepares for the Juvenile Fillies Turf. The move was the fastest of the Casse Breeders' Cup horses and sixth fastest of 39 at the distance. Robert Masterson's Tepin entered last year's Mile off a seven-length victory in the First Lady Stakes (gr. IT) on the Keeneland turf and followed with a 2 1/4-length score in the Mile. In this year's First Lady, Tepin suffered her first loss of 2016 when she finished second to front-running upset winner Photo Call.  While Casse obviously would have preferred Tepin win the First Lady, after taking some time to look at the result, he believes the performance will set her up well for her Breeders' Cup bid. Teresa Viola Racing Stables' Photo Call earned the year's top Equibase Speed Figure, 128, with her 2 3/4-length win, while Tepin was awarded a 124. That figure is three points better than the 121 she ran in winning the Ricoh Woodbine Mile (Can-IT) Sept. 17, and 10 points better than her number in last year's First Lady run on soft turf. "After analyzing the race over a period of 24 hours, I thought the race was better than it looked. We knew going in that she was going to regress a little bit off of her previous start, and it was one of the reasons why we chose the First Lady over the Shadwell Turf Mile (gr. IT)," Casse said. "That being said, I think Photo Call really ran a huge race. ... So much was said about Tepin getting beat, where I think maybe the emphasis should have been more on how great Photo Call ran. So I tip my hat to her." Going into the race, Casse thought Celestine might be Tepin's main competition. Seeing those two on even terms at the quarter pole and then watching Tepin finish 3 1/2 lengths ahead of that grade I winner gives Casse confidence going into the Mile. He said Tepin has settled into a routine at Churchill Downs since moving from Saratoga Race Course, where she was based in the summer. "It amazes me to watch Tepin and her attitude, how she moves at Saratoga versus how she does at Churchill Downs. It's night-and-day," Casse said. "I mean, the old Tepin—I see her. We tried to get ready for the Woodbine Mile and then, of course, the First Lady in Saratoga, but since getting back to her home in Louisville, she's refreshed. She looks great. I thought watching her train this week that she's moving better than I've ever seen her move." While Tepin aims to add to her long list of accomplishments, John Oxley's Classic Empire will enter the Juvenile off his first grade I win, a three-length victory in which he showed maturity rating in third early before overwhelming 11 rivals under Julien Leparoux. Casse said Classic Empire is very competitive, which is one of the reasons he stopped working him in company. NOVAK: Classic Empire in Breeders' Futurity Score Earlier this year Classic Empire worked with eventual dead-heat Spinaway Stakes (gr. I) winner Pretty City Dancer but because of Classic Empire's talent and competitive drive that proved a mismatch. "I told (assistant Norm Casse) that we had to stop working them together, because I didn't want Classic Empire hurting her confidence. We knew she was good too," Casse said. "When he sees something, he wants to run after it. I mean if he sees a fly, he will go." Casse thinks the reason Classic Empire wheeled and dumped rider Irad Ortiz Jr. at the start of the Hopeful Stakes (gr. I) at Saratoga was because he spotted an auxillary gate along the outside rail. Blinkers were added for the Breeders' Futurity and the trainer hopes that issue is behind him. "I want to say it's behind us, but I'm also knocking on wood," Casse said. "Seeing him break from post 11 smoothly in the Breeders' Futurity and work his way into that stalking position was a good feeling." Casse said the Oct. 8 Breeders' Futurity win was huge because it essentially was Classic Empire's first start in three months because of the Hopeful problems and was his first try at two turns. Casse sees a young horse moving forward.  "What really struck me about him in the Breeders' Futurity was that he just settled off of what was a fast pace. They went :46 3/5 for a half mile. And the ease that he was running, and watching Julien just sitting there, it really struck me," Casse said of the Breeders' Futurity. "I'm not being cocky, but I think I have the one to beat. He's a very good horse."

The Hariris are reaching out to potential buyers after a company they own in Turkey failed to pay an instalment of $290 million due in September and was given an extension until the end of October to resolve the matter, the people said, asking not to be named because the discussions are confidential. The loan is linked to the family’s purchase in 2005 of a majority stake in Turk Telekomunikasyon AS, Turkey’s biggest phone company. The family has requested an additional extension to the end of November to make a payment as they seek to raise funds via a stake sale, the people said. Three bidders including a telecoms operator not based in Turkey and a company from Qatar, are currently in talks to buy part of Oger Telecom Ltd, which the Hariris own along with Saudi Telecom Co, one of the people said. The troubled loan was the biggest syndication in Turkish history when it was issued in 2013, with 29 participants that included all of the country’s largest lenders, as well as international banks including Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Deutsche Bank AG. Turkey’s Akbank TAS has about $1.5 billion in exposure to the loan, while Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS lent about $1 billion, according to one of the people. Akbank and Garanti were among the six bookrunners and mandated lead arrangers on the loan, according to a statement from the borrower. Share moves Turk Telekom rose as much as 2.2 per cent to 5.96 liras in Istanbul, the highest level since Sept. 6 on a closing basis. Garanti fell as much as 1.1 per cent to 8.33 liras and Akbank declined 1.3 per cent to 8.22 liras. The Turkish Treasury owns around 30 per cent of Ankara-based Turk Telekom, which provides fixed, mobile and broadband services in the country. The remainder is traded on Borsa Istanbul. “While Oger’s payment problems does not directly have much to do with Turk Telekom, they were weighing on the stock’s performance,” Behlul Katas, an analyst at Istanbul-based Deniz Invest, said by phone. “The prospect that this pressure may be removed is helping improve investor sentiment. That said, despite the market’s initial enthusiasm; a sale is unlikely to impact the company’s fundamentals.” A refinancing of the 2013 debt is possible after the shareholder structure of Oger became clearer, one of the people said. Ojer Telekomunikasyon AS, the special purpose vehicle unit owned fully by Oger Telecom and set up to acquire the 55 per cent Turk Telekom stake, took the 2013 facility to refinance an earlier loan used to purchase the stake. Ojer, also known as Otas, pledged its holdings in Turk Telekom as collateral to borrow the loan, one of the people said. Otas had repaid about $500 million on the loan until the missed payment, people familiar with the deal said on October 12. No guarantees A senior Akbank executive, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter, declined to comment. Garanti also declined to comment via its public relations office, as did an executive at Ojer who asked not to be identified. “We do not expect news on media related to one of our shareholders Ojer Telekomunikasyon to have any impact on our daily operations, commitments or liabilities,” Turk Telekom said after reports of the missed loan repayment on October 12. “Financing agreements signed by Turk Telekom and its subsidiaries do not include cross-default provisions in relation to its shareholders missing their payments on their liabilities. Otas is not guarantor for any of our financing agreements. Our company does not have any guarantee or pledge in favour of Otas.” More from Telecoms Zain Saudi told to pay rival Mobily $58.5m Orange Egypt to get €500m loan for 4G licence Zain Saudi weighing fibre-internet service Pay App Store, Apple Music, iTunes via etisalat Du’s Q3 profit falls 6.66% due to higher fees Etisalat offers Start/Stop data service Du’s third-quarter profit falls 6.66% Etisalat subscriber base grows to 12.2m in UAE tags from this storyQatar follow this tag on MGNLebanon follow this tag on MGNDubai follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsTelecoms tagsQatar follow this tag on MGN+ MGNLebanon follow this tag on MGN+ MGNDubai follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In TelecomsZain Saudi told to pay rival Mobily $58.5m Business Gallery Kish island turns to be a major tourism hub Pakistan, China launch new trade route Business Videos PlayStrata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Zain Saudi told to pay rival Mobily $58.5m 02New SIM card offers cheap international calls 03Etisalat offers Start/Stop data service Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Britain is open for business Sep 20, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 1Image In pictures: Evolution of Emirates airline Oct 25, 2015 10Images Apple unveils Nike+ smartwatch Oct 29, 2016 14Images Trump casino closes in Atlantic City Oct 11, 2016 15Images Inside a Russian precious metals plant Oct 26, 2016 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News 'Utter devastation' after New Zealand quakes Viral: Saudi man’s love poem to Ivanka Trump Your guide to tonight’s Supermoon Best airlines to fly with in 2017 Indian embassy to take up expats’ rupee concerns Gold posts biggest price drop in months Meet the best street cleaners in UAE Baby placed at cliff edge for souvenir photo Revealed: Countries with great jobs Close Recommended For You Religious leaders praise haven of tolerance PUBLISHED ON Nov 15, 2016 Opec said to start final push on oil-cuts planPUBLISHED ON Nov 15, 2016 UAE: 'We don't want to see any discrimination'PUBLISHED ON Nov 15, 2016 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

The global banking space has been weathering a number of storms since the start of the global financial crisis in 2008, the latest being the uncertainty around the U.K. exit from the European Unio n. Add to that the poor economic outlook and negative interest rates and the pressure is heaped on a bank's profitability. But while the European banks struggle to keep their share price stable, their counterparts at the Wall Street seem to be doing a much better job. "European banks have had a particularly tough 2016, with the Stoxx 600 banking sector seeing declines of over 20 percent so far this year," Alex Dryden, Global Market Strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management told CNBC via email. "This puts the European banking sector on track for its worst year since the depths of the euro zone debt crisis in 2011." Dryden however further explained that despite the sharp pullback in banking share prices, and speculation that investors are not pricing in the impending collapse of one or more European banks, the region's banking system is not on the brink of collapse it found itself at the height of the global financial crisis. "The cost of buying insurance against European financials firms has ticked up in 2016, but is still below the highs of the euro zone debt crisis. If we dig a little deeper into the balance sheets of European financial companies, there is actually more cause for comfort than concern. These show that European banks have taken significant steps to strengthen their position since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and euro zone debt crisis." But a number of analysts have said that European banks face an entire basket of uncertainties that tend to weigh on their performance. Latest earnings results show that while Deutsche Bank and Barclays have posted better-than-expected results in the third quarter, concerns over their performance in the final quarter of the year and their future continues to loom. The situation is however quite different with big U.S. banks such as JP Morgan , Citi and Goldman Sachs that have posted stronger-than-expected profits in the third quarter. "There are a number of major reasons that we prefer U.S. banks over European banks," Naeem Aslam, chief markets analyst at Think Markets UK told CNBC via email. "Firstly, it is the interest rate environment which is a lot more favorable for the U.S. banks. The Fed is about to increase the interest rate for one more time this year and this is going to be positive news for them. But if you look in Europe, we do not think that interest rates are going to move higher anytime soon" Aslam further explained that the fixed income business and their investment arms are performing very well over in the U.S. and this trend could continue. "As for European banks, they are in process of cutting the fat and still structural reforms remain the key issue. Also, if you look at the number of toxic assets, European banks have an abundance of these, although they are getting rid some of them now. The U.S. banks have strong balance sheets and they are in a much better position. " The International Monetary Fund in its latest Global Financial Stability report said that more deep-rooted reforms and systemic management were needed, especially for European banks. The report further stated that European investment banks in general have higher leverage and more compressed risk weightings on assets than their U.S. counterparts, suggesting that they have a more challenging adjustment path. According to the IMF, the European banking sector faces three major headwinds – these include high levels of non-performing loans, excess capacity in the banking system and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) - requires an 8 percent bail-in of a bank's creditors, including very large foreign banks and hedge funds — be applied before taxpayers get put on the hook. "The return on assets for European banks is structurally low at 0.25 to 0.50 percent, compared with about 1 percent at U.S. banks," the IMF report said.
