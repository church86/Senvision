JPMorgan expects the S&P 500 to end the year at 2,000, representing a roughly 6 percent decline from its current level, making it the most bearish of its peers on the Street. In this scenario, the market leaders are poised for the biggest fall, while some sector laggards will do relatively better, Lakos-Bujas said. Lakos-Bujas sees rising equity market volatility as central to the pullback. Following a two-month period of very low volatility, investors have been lulled into a sense of complacency, and any pickup in volatility could spark a "deleveraging event," in which investors dump stocks, he said. That selling will not necessarily happen immediately, he said, but an initial wave of selling could snowball by breeding negative sentiment and aversion to risk. Already, investors are feeling cautious as stocks sit at lofty valuations, he said. "Positioning is pretty stretched. Technicals are exhausted. So if anything, I would probably be waiting for some further correction, and then take advantage of that to turn slightly more constructive," he told CNBC's "Fast Money: Halftime Report." The recent rise in long-term sovereign debt yields is also cause for concern because it stands to draw investors out of dividend-yielding stocks like telecoms and utilities, which have served as substitutes for bonds during a period of persistently low interest rates. Dividend-yielders have been the biggest beneficiaries of outflows from bonds with low or negative yields, Lakos-Bujas said. Since those defensive stocks have driven S&P 500 gains, interest rates need to stay lower in order for the market to maintain current levels. "If yields continue to spike up, that could pressurize the market," he said, adding that the Bank of Japan's monetary policy decision later this month will be critical. JPMorgan believes investors will ultimately rotate out of those defensives and into sectors that have not performed as well. The bank's sector picks are health care, energy, materials and financials. Investors got a preview of this when utilities and telecoms led a market sell-off last Friday, Lakos-Bujas said.

Analysts say it's an attractive investment. Alicia McElhaney Sep 14, 2016 4:38 PM EDT JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  on Wednesday surpassed Wells Fargo (WFC)   as the most valuable bank by market cap, and analysts say the new leader of the bulge bracket banks could be the more attractive investment going forward after Wells' recent sales debacle. "We have a sell recommendation on Wells and a buy on JPMorgan," analyst Dick Bove of Rafferty Capital said in an interview. "The reason that we have a sell on Wells Fargo is because it appears that its internal control systems have broken down." Wells Fargo's cap was at $236.94 billion at market's close Tuesday, while JPMorgan's clocked in at $240.27 billion. Wells Fargo's shares have fallen 6% since Friday. The company closed at $46.52 per share Wednesday. Meanwhile, JPMorgan has seen share prices rise 5.4% in the past 52 weeks, and is nearing its high of $69.03 per share it hit on Nov. 15. The company closed Wednesday at $66.40 per share, down 13 cents from Tuesday's close. "JPMorgan is hot as a firecracker right now," Bove said. "Its lending businesses are performing extremely well." Bove added that the company has big backlogs for its underwriting business, and that its cost-control measures are working well compared Wells Fargo's apparent lack of control over its human resources department. Bove noted Wells Fargo has multiple things to correct in its internal operations. Wells Fargo's shares have been falling since news broke Friday, Sept. 9, that the company had been pushing employees to reach unrealistic sales targets. Thanks to this pressure, employees opened fake accounts under customer names, then closed them before customers realized, just to get numbers up. The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday just before market close that federal prosecutors were investigating the sales practices at the bank. "We want to be clear that the cross-selling itself was not the issue, but rather the aggressive tactics that were used to open and close accounts without the knowledge of some customers," wrote Jim Cramer, TheStreet's founder and manager of the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio, which owns WFC, in a post Sept. 13. "This has undoubtedly put a dent in Wells Fargo's 'good guy' brand, which had partially aided the stock in its recent, high relative valuation compared to its peers." Wells Fargo will pay a $185 million fine to the U.S. government, and let go of 5,300 employees. None of those fired worked as C-suite employees, who blame employees, rather than management, for wrongdoings. Additionally, the company will no longer have specific sales targets. "When a CEO says it's not my fault, it's the fault of the people not doing jobs, he doesn't have any method of understanding what his employees are doing," Bove said. " How do these people get hired? Once they were hired, why was there no effective way of monitoring what they were doing?" According to analyst Kevin Barker of Piper Jaffray, who has an underweight rating on Wells Fargo, the company has more problems than this accounts scandal.  "We've been fairly negative on the company, not because of the issues they had with cross selling, but primarily due to growth concerns and additional regulatory costs," Barker said in an interview. He added that the latest problems at Wells can likely cause its fee income to stagnate further than it already has. Part of the problem is likely because Wells Fargo is a much larger than it used to be. The company purchased Wachovia during the financial crisis, which added $812 billion in assets, more than doubling its asset based. Today the company has about $1.9 trillion in assets today, Barker noted. "Wells Fargo had historically been considered one of the better managed banks," Barker said. "They built that reputation through the financial crisis and prior to it....This is a much bigger bank with a lot more complicated and much harder to manage." Both banks inked deals Wednesday morning, which could move the needle on size even more. JPMorgan's Chase division signed a multi-year deal with Best Buy (BBY) to accept Chase Pay in stores, online and through Best Buy's app. Chase Pay allows customers to pay with one click, no longer having to enter credit card or shipping information. No terms of the contract were disclosed publicly. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo Securities, the investment and capital markets arm of Wells Fargo, announced Wednesday that it is selling its fund administration business, Wells Fargo Global Fund Services, to SS&C Technologies Holdings Inc. (SSNC) . No terms were released for this deal either. Whether these deals will have a significant impact on share price of either company is unclear.

John Hickenlooper Announces $9.5 Million to Launch Statewide Youth Apprenticeship and Career Readiness Programs Gov. John Hickenlooper announced today that Bloomberg Philanthropies and JPMorgan Chase & Co. have together committed $9.5 million to CareerWise Colorado (formerly Business and Schools in Collaboration, or BASIC), a new statewide apprenticeship system for high school students, and Denver Public Schools’ (DPS) CareerConnect. Partnering with the state, Bloomberg Philanthropies committed $5.5 million to CareerWise and JPMorgan Chase dedicated $4 million to Denver Public Schools Foundation for a pilot program that equips the district’s high school students with high-demand skills for lucrative careers and postsecondary opportunities in Colorado’s leading industries. U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas E. Perez joined Hickenlooper during the announcement to highlight the Obama administration’s work in supporting youth apprenticeships and experiential learning. “In order to create shared prosperity for all Americans, we need to help more people access the skills and training they need to compete for the jobs of today and tomorrow. Apprenticeships are a tried and true training strategy that offer a path to the middle class and expand opportunities for working people,” said Perez. “The learn-while-you-earn model is instrumental to the competitiveness of our businesses, the strength of our economy and the future of our workforce. I applaud Colorado for making the investments that will help usher shared prosperity in the 21st century.” “Colorado is known as a national leader for innovative strategies to increase student achievement and improve opportunities for students once they finish high school,” Hickenlooper said. “This is an example of businesses coming together with schools that will help build better pathways to good careers and give more students access to the middle class. It will be an option for students from cities and towns across Colorado and for students who want to start their careers right away or want to pursue a college degree. They will all benefit from work experience and earning money along the way.” As growing industries in Colorado have an increased need to find skilled workers who can compete at a global level, the apprenticeship program will lead to a direct path for youth in the state to access higher education and well-paying jobs in high-demand industries. “We need to unleash our capacity for stronger, broader long-term growth by ensuring all young people are given the opportunity to acquire the skills needed for their future success and to support the competitiveness of our industries,” said Michael R. Bloomberg, founder of Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies. “To do this, businesses and educators must work together to ensure the skills being taught match those needed – not just for today’s workforce, but in the workforce of tomorrow. That’s exactly what this partnership in Colorado seeks to achieve.” Bloomberg Philanthropies is investing in a series of new, innovative career and technical education pilots around the country. All pilots feature strong local leadership and robust partnership across education, industry, government and non-profit sectors. The goal is to create a clear, comprehensive evidence base and increased capacity to replicate at scale the best of what works. “We have a moral responsibility to do what we can to give our young people the best chance to succeed after high school,” said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase. “Our investment in Denver’s youth will provide them with greater opportunities for meaningful employment and long-term economic success.” Students in their last two years of high school will be eligible to participate in CareerWise Colorado beginning in the fall of 2017. The program will begin with 250 apprentices and grow to serve about 20,000 students, or 10 percent of eligible high school students in the state, within 10 years. Participating students will spend up to half of their time on-site with employers while still earning credit toward high school graduation and post-secondary credentials toward a two-year degree. An additional year of apprenticeship post-graduation will further prepare students to enter the workforce directly or continue their post-secondary education at a community or four-year college. Apprentice students will be employees of partner businesses and paid a training wage for the time they are at work. CareerWise Colorado will build on the success of existing programs like DPS CareerConnect, which has been a statewide and national leader in providing students with project-based learning for career exploration, coaching, internships and college coursework to better prepare students for college and careers. JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s $4 million commitment, which is part of the firm’s global $75 million, five-year New Skills for Youth initiative to strengthen career education and create pathways to economic success for young people, will enhance CareerConnect to expand the program to include Denver’s K-8 students, and will initiate a bold, new apprenticeship model called CareerResidency. Currently, DPS CareerConnect serves more than 6,000 Denver students and helps them develop the skills and education for opportunities in Colorado’s engineering, tech, biomedical, advanced manufacturing and finance industries, and with this grant, plans to reach 9,000 students over the next three years. “The work that this funding supports will provide a bridge to districts in the metro area and across Colorado,” said DPS Superintendent Tom Boasberg. “We are excited to expand our own offerings to prepare students for successful careers and to share what we’ve learned through programs like CareerConnect with students from all over the state,” Boasberg continued. The Daniels Fund, Markle Foundation and the Walton Family Foundation have provided additional funds to support the youth apprenticeship system, along with support from the State of Colorado. This brings the total level of financial support for the program to more than $11 million. “Currently Colorado has an estimated 25,000 weekly job vacancies in high-growth industries that go unfilled because of a lack of skilled workers, costing the state over $300 million in lost GDP,” said Noel Ginsburg, chairman and CEO of Intertech Plastics. “Business can play a critical role in education that goes far beyond simply advising educators. By extending the classroom into our places of business, we can become producers, not just consumers, of the education system. The apprenticeship model will provide greater choice and opportunity for students in fulfilling their future career goals, while at the same time addressing the critical skills gap in business and industry, enabling them to better compete in the global economy,” Ginsburg added. Ginsburg chairs the Business Experiential-Learning (BEL) Commission established by Hickenlooper to work with the Colorado Workforce Development Council. Their partnership is focused on building business-led experiential learning opportunities like youth apprenticeships. “There will be growth and tangible benefit for all who participate in this program,” said Kent Thiry, DaVita chairman and CEO. “That benefit extends to everyone from the apprentices to the business community and the city of Denver with its expanding workforce in need of diverse talent.” In its first year, students will be placed in apprenticeships with leading Colorado companies working in one of four pathways including advanced manufacturing, business operations, financial services and information technology. As the program expands into more schools and communities and new businesses develop apprentices, additional pathways will be added. “My experience at Mikron has been great. I’ve learned about working at a company doing advanced manufacturing and it has given me the chance to gain skills that are going to help me in college and in my full-time career,” said Selena Elekovic, a student at Cherry Creek High School. “Now I know that I want to study mechanical engineering and go into that field after college. I’m excited that even more students are going to have this sort of apprenticeship in the future.” About CareerWise Colorado CareerWise Colorado is building a statewide system of youth apprenticeships that create pathways for students to access high-demand, high-paying careers at leading Colorado companies. Student apprentices also work toward high school graduation and earn postsecondary credit, industry credentials or both in their chosen career path. Established by the Business Experiential-Learning (BEL) Commission created by Gov. John Hickenlooper and chaired by Noel Ginsburg of Intertech Plastics, CareerWise Colorado will launch 250 apprenticeships in 2017 in school districts in metro Denver, the Western Slope and Colorado’s Eastern Plains. 20,000 youth apprentices, or about 10 percent of Colorado students in their last two years of high school, are expected to participate by 2027.

JPMorgan Chase has surpassed Wells Fargo as the biggest U.S. bank by market capitalization. Wells Fargo had been the largest by market cap since 2013, based on closing values. Shares of Wells Fargo fell more 3 percent on Tuesday, while JPMorgan Chase closed 0.79 percent lower. That gave JPMorgan Chase a market cap of nearly $240.3 billion versus almost $236.9 billion for Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo shares have been under pressure in the past few days after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and two other regulators fined the bank $185 million. The bank must also pay another $5 million to customers for creating more than 2 million fake accounts for products like credit and debit cards to meet aggressive sales targets. On Tuesday, the bank said beginning next year it would eliminate all product sales goals in retail banking. With Tuesday's declines, Wells Fargo saw its worst daily performance since June 24 and its first three-day losing streak since Aug. 3. —CNBC's Gina Francolla and Reuters contributed to this report.

Photo: AFP Pacific Investment Management Co’s (PIMCO) Total Return Fund, the world’s biggest actively run debt fund, is trimming its bet on bonds. Total Return cut the duration of its holdings to 5.27 years as of Aug. 31 from 5.44 years at the end of July, based on data on the company Web site. It was the lowest level since May. It also reduced its holdings of US government bonds and related securities last month. US 10-year yields rose on Monday to the highest level since June on speculation the US Federal Reserve would raise interest rates before the end of the year. “It’s time for the central bank to move,” JPMorgan Chase & Co chief executive Jamie Dimon said. DoubleLine Capital LP chief investment officer Jeffrey Gundlach said investors should prepare for rising interest rates. The US planned to auction US$12 billion of 30-year bonds yesterday. “Let’s just raise rates,” Dimon said on Monday at the Economic Club of Washington. “The Fed has to maintain credibility. I think it’s time to raise rates. Normality is a good thing, not a bad thing. The return to normal is a good thing.” The 10-year yield fell one basis point to 1.65 percent at 6:47am yesterday in London, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 1.5 percent security due in August 2026 rose US$0.63 per US$1,000 face value. The Fed cut its benchmark to almost zero about eight years ago, raising the target only once since then to a range of 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent in December last year. In the two decades prior to the December 2008 reduction, the rate averaged about 3.5 percent. Total Return Fund trimmed its holdings of US government and related debt to about 43 percent of assets from about 46 percent, based on the Web site data. PIMCO is “continuing to reduce” its Treasury holdings, said Scott Mather, one of the three managers of the Total Return Fund, which has US$85.8 billion in assets and is based in Newport Beach, California. The firm sees value in inflation-linked debt and mortgage bonds, he said on Bloomberg Television on Aug. 29. The fund’s stake in government securities can include Treasuries and related investments such as inflation-protected bonds, futures contracts and agency debt, PIMCO said. Gundlach said in a Web cast last week fixed-income investors should reduce the duration of their positions and move money into cash. Duration is a measure of a bond’s sensitivity to changes in yield and a smaller figure indicates a more bearish position. “This is a big, big moment,” Gundlach said. “Interest rates have bottomed. They may not rise in the near term as I’ve talked about for years, but I think it’s the beginning of something and you’re supposed to be defensive.” Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard on Monday said there is no rush to raise rates. Federal Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart repeated on Monday his call for a “serious discussion” about raising interest rates this month. His counterpart in Boston, Eric Rosengren, argued last week there was a reasonable case for gradual tightening. Futures contracts indicate a 22 percent chance the central bank would raise rates when it meets next week and a 57 percent probability of a move by December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

 Millennials aren't spending money like their parents did Matt Turner Sep. 14, 2016, 12:31 AM 35,435 facebook linkedin twitter email print A millennial at the Burning Man festival. Aly Weisman/Business Insider Millennials are spending their money differently from their parents and grandparents. Gordon Smith, chief executive for consumer and community banking at JPMorgan, gave a presentation on Monday at the Barclays Financial Services Conference discussing the spending patterns of millennials. JPMorgan is especially focused on this group, and we've written before about the bank spending big to land younger customers. The chart below shows what millennials and non-millennials purchased using Chase debit and credit cards in 2015. To clear up any confusion, JPMorgan defined millennials as those born between 1981 and 1997, while non-millennials are those born before 1981. You'll see that millennials spend a lot more on "experiences" — things like travel, entertainment, and dining. JPMorgan The spending patterns of the millennial generation are important, as they'll be shaping consumer demand for years to come. The compound annual growth rate in retail spending from this group is forecast to be 15% from 2014 to 2020, versus a 4% increase for those ages 35 and up.

By supporting new business growth, the grant gives a financial boost to the Great Places 2020 plan for the River West neighborhood near IUPUI and the 16 Tech innovation district. BOI provides free, one-on-one coaching to entrepreneurs and business owners, and administers the nation's largest Chamber-affiliated microloan program; these modest loans up to $50,000 provide critical capital for small businesses that may not meet traditional lending standards. BOI is a U.S. Small Business Administration microloan partner that also receives funding from the City of Indianapolis and corporate partners like JPMorgan Chase. "The JPMorgan Chase Foundation has supported our microlending and coaching programs from the start," said Carrie Henderson, President of BOI and Sr. Director of Entrepreneur Services for the Indy Chamber. "You can see the entrepreneurial spirit of River West in its Great Places 2020 plan - with the continued commitment of JPMorgan Chase to Indy's business community and its neighborhoods, we'll be able to make a real impact on up-and-coming small businesses in an up-and-coming area." The Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) leads Great Places 2020 along with partners like the Indy Chamber, United Way of Central Indiana, Keep Indianapolis Beautiful, the Indianapolis Neighborhood Housing Partnership and City of Indianapolis. 'Great Places' neighborhoods create long-range strategic plans for economic development, infrastructure, housing, and quality of life initiatives that contribute to redevelopment and growth. "JPMorgan Chase is a proud supporter of Great Places 2020 - we believe that great neighborhoods make a great city," said Al Smith, chairman of JPMorgan Chase Indiana. "By bringing much-needed expertise and access to capital to the planned Source River West center through BOI, this grant will be a down payment on a thriving business community in and around River West." In 2015, the Indy Chamber's Entrepreneur Services team provided nearly 5,000 hours of free business coaching, and another 5,500 combined hours of classes and workshops aimed at small business issues. BOI made roughly $280,000 in microloans last year; its efforts led to 85 new business start-ups. The JPMorgan Chase Foundation grant will allow a BOI business coach to staff the Source River West center, working one-on-one with business owners, administering the microloan program and facilitating a regular schedule of small business and entrepreneurship classes and other outreach programs. IUPUI is the institutional partner behind the center's development. Serving as fiscal agent to support the launch of Source River West Great Place Entrepreneurship Center, IUPUI provides staffing, planning expertise, and educational services for the center. "The Source River West Entrepreneurship Center is more than just a location on West Michigan Street," said Phil Votaw, Executive Director of the Westside Community Development Corporation, the lead agency in the River West Great Places 2020 application. "It will help many businesses get started that will potentially locate in the River West/ Near West area." Indy Chamber CEO Michael Huber explained that expanded business coaching, microlending and other small business and entrepreneurship programs is part of a comprehensive regional growth strategy, adding that under-served neighborhoods like River West also have unique opportunities in today's economy. "Across the country, most new business and job creation is happening in major cities, where people can live and work in walkable neighborhoods," Huber said. "We support the 16 Tech innovation district east of the White River, and convenient mass transit that also connects River West to IUPUI, downtown and the rest of the city. "This area could quickly become another frontier for high-tech jobs and new development, with plenty of potential for homegrown entrepreneurship. Thanks to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation, we can play a bigger role in helping this 'Great Place' live up to its potential." LISC recently announced funding for an additional two neighborhoods to join Great Places 2020; visit GreatPlaces2020.org for details and to explore River West and the other Great Places plans.

Alts Currency-Hedged Equities Fixed-Income New ETFs Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2016 → September → Consider Alternative ETFs as Traditional Assets Run on Fumes Consider Alternative ETFs as Traditional Assets Run on Fumes Max Chen September 14, 2016 0 Comment Actively Managed ETFs, Alternatives, Current Affairs, JPHF, Lead, New ETFs, Webcasts The fixed-income and equities markets have extended their bull run but their momentum is beginning to fade. With valuations high and risks ahead, investors should look to an alternative exchange traded fund strategy to hedge their portfolios. On the upcoming webcast, Look to Alternatives as Traditional Stocks, Bonds Run on Fumes, Jillian DelSignore, Executive Director and Head of ETF Distribution at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Yazann Romahi, Portfolio Manager and Head of Global Multi-Asset Research in the Multi-Asset Solutions Team at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, and Mark Matthews, Investment Research Analyst at CLS Investments, will outline various alternative strategies and ways the asset category can provide uncorrelated returns to traditional bond and stock investments to diversify a portfolio. For instance, the recently launched JPMorgan Diversified Alternatives ETF (NYSEArca: JPHF), J.P. Morgan’s first actively managed ETF to hit the market, combines various hedge fund-esque, alternative investment strategies in an easy-to-use ETF wrapper. Trending on ETF Trends An ETF Bond Alternative with No Rate Risk Consider Precious Metal ETFs to Hedge Against Global Risks Prepping an ETF Portfolio for Risks Ahead A Preferred Securities ETF Strategy for Yield Seekers A Preferred ETF Strategy to Hone in on Income Specifically, JPHF will include equity long/short, event driven and global macro based strategies. The fund is managed by Rohami and Victor Lee, Managing Director and a Regional Specialist at J.P. Morgan. The equity long/short strategy involves simultaneously taking equities that are attractive based on relevant return factors and selling equities that are unattractive based on relevant return factors. The long/short strategy will try to produce alpha through exploiting pricing inefficiencies between equity securities through long and short positions. The event driven strategy will try to profit from companies on the basis that a specific event or catalyst will affect future pricing. For example, merger arbitrage strategies try to capitalize on price discrepancies and returns in corporate transactions. Lastly, the global macro based strategy tries to exploit macro economic imbalances across the globe. The strategy may be implemented through a number of asset classes, including stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. The group of liquid alternative funds has been a growing investment category following the financial downturn as more investors turned to alternative investment avenues in an attempt to diversify their portfolios. The group of liquid alt funds that categories like equity long/short, event driven, relative value, macro and multistrategy often did better than the hedge fund indices. SEE MORE: ETFs Tracking Liquid Alts Outperform Traditional Hedge Funds Liquid alternative funds provided a much cheaper way to access the same kind of hedge fund-esque exposure – hedge funds may include a normal management fee of 1% to 2% on top of a performance fees of as much as 20% of annual gains. Potential investors should be aware that these types of investments are not meant as growth strategies to generate outsized returns in investment portfolios. In reality, these strategies are doing exactly what they were made for, diminishing volatility. Consequently, in bullish market conditions, the strategies may underperform, but if the markets sour, alts can shine.

Credit: REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch More like this Forget fingerprints; Iris scans could validate mobile payments How it works: Iris scanning improves smartphone security 5 trends shaking up multi-factor authentication Video IT security: 3 things you need to know now With little fanfare, JPMorgan Chase on Monday (Sept. 12) reversed its security position on its mobile app, removing the need to type in a password once a customer has already been authenticated by either Apple's Touch ID or an Android biometric scan. Before Monday, Chase customers could log in using a biometric scan and see things such as balances but needed to authenticate themselves again with a password for transferring funds or making a payment. Now the biometric scan is sufficient for all bank functions. This is the latest in the battle between security reality and security perception. From a pure security perspective, any decently implemented biometric authentication (fingerprint, in this case) is far more secure than most passwords. But because of the biometric scan's ease and speed, some retailers and bankers feared that consumers might not perceive a transaction as secure unless the app also forced the typing of a password. Chase spokesperson Rebecca Acevedo said the change was caused by data coming from various handset makers. "About a year ago, Chase implemented Touch ID on iOS. We were the first major U.S. bank to do so. When we launched in 2015, we included a second step to the process that asked consumers for a password to transfer money or pay bills," Acevedo said. "Over the past year, the mobile phone manufacturers have continued to provide additional analytics into the level of security for Touch ID. We also heard from our customers that a one-step process would make banking easier, so we updated the mobile app to just biometrics." For the record, Chase said that it added biometric support for its Android app in March 2016. As for what those additional manufacturer-provided analytics told Chase, Acevedo said, "Unfortunately, we can’t share that information, but that information has made [Chase officials] more comfortable." As for Chase having "heard from our customers that a one-step process would make banking easier" — really? Chase needed customers to tell it that reducing authentication from two steps to one would be easier? Isn't that inherently obvious? Chase confirmed that it will now allow all functions without passwords, relying solely on biometrics. Obviously, that is limited to anything actually on Chase's site. "There are some sites that we link out to from the mobile app that require you to sign in," Acevedo said. This is an important development. Unlike a similar biometrics headache that hit retailers back in May, that retail problem stemmed from processor systems that couldn't see if a biometric authentication had already taken place. Therefore, it demanded a signature after a fingerprint scan verification already happened. That retail issue was doubly infuriating because, unlike PINs and passwords, signatures deliver absolutely nothing today in terms of secure authentication. But Chase's systems always knew when a biometric authentication was used, making the password demand truly annoying and pointless. I would love to see what data the handset makers provided that told Chase anything it didn't already know. From a security perspective, all the phone makers could have shared would be how popular the biometric authentications are and how few successful authentication frauds have happened. The most likely data is simply a change in how consumers perceive biometrics. As long as customers see biometric authentication as more secure, there is little to no perception risk in abandoning passwords/PINs on top of it. One problem here is that multifactor authentication assumes that the various factors are all independent and secure. Adding signature on top of PIN, for example, is not a viable MFA approach because signature adds no meaningful verification. Given how easy PINs and passwords can be to shoulder-surf or to steal in other ways, such as sniffing or keystroke-capturing, biometrics makes sense. If you want to marry that to, perhaps, a one-time access code messaged to a phone and only good for x minutes from point of transmission, fine. But I think the death of the password is long overdue. In geeky news, Chase also said that it was incorporating 3D Touch functionality into the app. That's where iPhones/iPads can perform differently based on how hard a user presses the screen. Chase said that users of its iOS app can now use 3D Touch "to quickly access ATM and Chase locations near you by pressing on the app icon." That's a nice trick, but ditching the superfluous password was much more comforting. This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?

Corporate headquarters in the Manhattan borough of New York. Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 11:20 PM, September 14, 2016 Updated: 12:35 AM, September 15, 2016 NEW YORK - JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> said on Wednesday it has hired General Electric Co <GE.N> lending veteran Clarence Nunn to lead its middle market expansion strategy in the Southeastern United States. Nunn, 51, will be based in Charlotte, North Carolina, and will succeed Mark Bensabat, who is retiring next year after more than 35 years in banking, the company said. Nunn will also manage the franchise finance business of Chase's Middle Market Banking & Specialized Industries team. He worked at General Electric for 24 years and was chief executive of GE Capital's franchise finance business, JPMorgan said. This year Chase is adding middle market banking offices in eight cities nationally. In the Southeast it has been operating from 15 cities. As the biggest bank in the United States by assets, JPMorgan is essentially barred from acquiring other banks to become bigger. Instead, to extend the bank's reach geographically and reap more economies of scale, executives have said they will add offices in new areas and extend their marketing to new customers. (Story corrects to show that Chase is adding middle market banking offices in eight cities across the United States, instead of just in the U.S. Southeast, paragraph 4.)

Morgan Rolls Out Its First Active ETF Strategy J.P. Morgan Rolls Out Its First Active ETF Strategy Tom Lydon September 14, 2016 0 Comment Actively Managed ETFs, Alternatives, Current Affairs, JPHF, Lead, New ETFs Exchange traded fund investors can now gain exposure to J.P. Morgan’s extensive management experience through its first active ETF that covers various alternative strategies taken from tested hedge fund plays. On Wednesday, J.P. Morgan launched the JPMorgan Diversified Alternatives ETF (NYSEArca: JPHF). JPHF has a total expense ratio of 0.85%. JPHF was designed and is managed by Yazann Romahi, Global Head of Quantitative Beta Solutions at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. The  Diversified Alternatives ETF strategy was created by Romahi along with the support of a team of 17 investment specialists focused on beta philosophy research and development for over a decade. “Since 2005, we’ve had a team dedicated to researching and developing a leading alternative beta capability and we are thrilled to adapt this strategy for a new investment wrapper,” Romahi said in a press release. “JPHF helps to increase diversification, reduce overall portfolio volatility and deliver higher portfolio risk-adjusted returns.” The new fund will incorporate institutional quality hedge fund strategies in a cost efficient ETF wrapper. “In the past, alternative investments have been an exclusive option only accessible by a small portion of investors; however, JPHF now makes these investment vehicles available to a wider array of investors,” Robert Deutsch, Head of ETFs for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said. “Alternative beta strategies provide investors with true diversification with attractive liquidity, transparency and cost.” Trending on ETF Trends Legg Mason Adds New Emerging Market ETF to Low Volatility Suite A New Active Short-Term Bond ETF to Play Rising Rate Risks A Smart-Beta, Small-Cap ETF to Help Investors Cope with Volatility A New ETF Targeting High Yield Developed Market Dividend Stocks A New Smart Beta Restaurant ETF is on the Menu Specifically, JPHF will include equity long/short, event driven and global macro based strategies. The equity long/short strategy involves simultaneously taking equities that are attractive based on relevant return factors and selling equities that are unattractive based on relevant return factors. The long/short strategy will try to produce alpha through exploiting pricing inefficiencies between equity securities through long and short positions. The event driven strategy will try to profit from companies on the basis that a specific event or catalyst will affect future pricing. For example, merger arbitrage strategies try to capitalize on price discrepancies and returns in corporate transactions. Lastly, the global macro based strategy tries to exploit macro economic imbalances across the globe. The strategy may be implemented through a number of asset classes, including stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. Essentially, the managing advisor will try to generate positive total returns over time while including a relatively low correlation to traditional markets.

RISING STARS Why Millennials Are Freaking Out Over a Credit Card With a $450 Annual Fee It's the perks, man. By Justin Bariso Justin Bariso is an author and the founder of INSIGHT, a consultancy that helps organizations think differently and communicate with impact. In 2015, LinkedIn named him one of their top three management writers of the year. His first book, scheduled for release late 2016, serves as a practical guide to developing emotional intelligence and making it work for you. @JustinJBariso Founder, Insight@JustinJBariso WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement It's official: The Chase Sapphire Reserve has gone viral. JPMorgan Chase, which launched the credit card just a few weeks ago, told Bloomberg it approved "tens of thousands" of applications in the first two days--despite the fact that it carries ... wait for it ... a $450 annual fee. But what's really interesting about this story is who wants these cards. According to Chase spokeswoman Lauren Francis, the majority of cards are going to Millennials. Say what? The same Millennials who are (supposedly) much less interested in credit cards than their older counterparts? Just last month, The New York Times reported that Millennials "aren't pulling out the plastic" like previous generations, under the headline "How Millennials Became Spooked by Credit Cards." Take a closer look. The Times continues: Data from the Federal Reserve indicates that the percentage of Americans under 35 who hold credit card debt has fallen to its lowest level since 1989, when the Fed began collecting data in a standardized way, according to an analysis by The New York Times. The problem is, this data doesn't talk about Millennials' possession of credit cards, but only about how much debt they carry. It's the perks, man But if the younger generation doesn't want credit cards for debt management, why do they want them? Put simply, for the perks. For example, I know Millennials who use their credit cards for every single purchase--and pay off their account balance in full every month. They do this solely to rack up points and earn free rewards. (My younger brother, for example, built an entire wardrobe from Old Navy through rewards certificates.) The Chase Sapphire Reserve Card is further proof of this. Despite the hefty fee, the card offers the following benefits. (Special shout out to The Points Guy for breaking this all down for us.) 100,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points (with a minimum of $4,000 spend on the card within the initial three months). Points can be transferred to various partners, including multiple airlines and hotels (estimated value: at least $1,500). 3 points per dollar on all travel and dining, worldwide (including money spent on Uber and Airbnb). Automatic $300 annual rebate for travel expenses. Priority Pass Select, allowing access to over 900 travel lounges around the world. $100 Global Entry credit every five years. Enhanced travel protections under the Visa Infinite program. No foreign transaction fees. Just a little understanding of the Millennial mindset gives insight into why the credit card blew up on the internet (with one thread discussing the card on Reddit attracting 10,000 comments). So many Millennials love to travel. And they love finding bargains even more. Looking back at those figures from the Fed, there's a lesson to be learned. The data may have been right, but the conclusion was wrong: Millennials don't dislike credit cards. They just dislike credit card debt. Like this column?

The stock fell after it was revealed the bank opened over two million unauthorized fee-accruing customer accounts. Read more Not too big to bail: Wells Fargo exec responsible for scam retires with $124.6mn The share price of Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway slid two percent on the news. The 86-year-old billionaire investor is the world’s fourth-richest person with a net worth of $65.8 billion. Wells Fargo also lost the crown of the world’s most valuable bank by market capitalization to JPMorgan after agreeing to scrap sales goals for retail bankers, effective January 1. The 3.3 percent sell-off slashed the company’s market value to $236.9 billion, compared with JPMorgan's market cap of $240.3 billion. The bank was fined $185 million last week after being accused by the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau of creating deposit and credit card accounts without clients' approval to boost sales. The phantom accounts resulted in some customers being charged fees for insufficient funds. Wells Fargo agreed to pay $5 million in compensation to customers. CEO John Stumpf will testify about the alleged misconduct. Wells Fargo said it had fired 5,300 employees involved in the misconduct. Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said on Tuesday Wells Fargo will "take a big wide fresh look at who knew what and when and what else might have been done," adding that it would impact people "at all levels of the organization."

Nelson Mandela Home About Us Projects Multimedia Opinion Reports Agenda Contacts Search for: Article written on 14.09.2016 at 08:20 AM by Joshua Massarenti Article tags Feminism multinational corporations Oxfam Tax category: Africa, Economy, Gender, Rights and Society Corporate tax is a feminist matter 0 Sep14 CitiGroup, Coca Cola, ExxonMobil, General Motors, Goldman Sachs, Verizon, Wal-Mart, Pfizer, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America and Microsoft; of all the things these multinational corporations (MNCs) agree on, two things stand out: a proclaimed devotion to the feminist agenda and a penchant for tax dodging. On the former, all MNC’s claim to dedicate some part of their corporate responsibility and philanthropy duties to the “economic empowerment” of women and girls in poor countries, and to that end, promote business skills, good saving practices and access to loans as a panacea for women’s empowerment and their countries’ development. The steps these corporations take “to advance and empower women” make them role models for gender justice among MNC’s, according to the United Nations Global Compact. But then there’s the tax issue. A few months ago, the NGO Oxfam calculated that between 2008 and 2014 alone, the 50 largest public companies in the US accumulated some $337 billion in tax breaks, while holding a whopping $1.4 trillion in offshore cash reserves. All the companies mentioned above are on the list. Tax dodging by MNCs represents “integral components of [their] profit-making strategies,” and a huge force of socio-economic devastation in particular for the Global South, where such taxes represent a larger share of overall government revenue (16%, according to the IMF, versus 8 % for their high-income counterparts), and where the technical capacity to deal with complex tax offshore investment hubs and other loopholes is weaker. Here, Oxfam argues, unpaid corporate taxes can make the “difference between life and death, poverty and opportunity.” The practice costs poor countries aroundUS$ 100 billion dollars a year. The result, predictably, is that across Africa, the working poor, (over 38% of the population in sub-Saharan Africa) often end up carrying the burden of raising tax revenue while the multinationals go scot-free. In Malawi, for example, where tax incentives for the mining sector allegedly suck out eight times the amount the government collects in revenues every year, some say that “it is the order of the day for small businesses to pay more tax than multinational companies.” Meanwhile, as a new investigation reveals, South African companies make extensive use of tax haven benefits in the Netherlands, where, apparently, “an office with a house plant is enough to satisfy tax inspectors that a company really has operations in [Amsterdam],” rather than just a letterbox company. (By routing money through the Netherlands, companies reportedly push down their tax rate from to as low as 0,6 %. Of the 20 largest companies listed on the Johannesburg stock exchange, 14 have one or more subsidiaries in the Netherlands). Within progressive feminist groups and anti-poverty NGOs, tax justice is now treated as a key development and human rights concern, with many feminists pointing out that it’s women and children who suffer the most, when social services are not provided. Chiara Capraro worked for Christian Aid, whose Death And Taxes report estimated, as early as 2008, that developing countries lost more to false invoicing and trade mis-pricing by corporations (more on that later) than what comes in as development aid. Later, in partnership with Tax Justice Network Africa (who tweet here), they published “Africa Rising” which (amongst other things) outlines steps on how to stop corporations and other elites from abusing tax loopholes. To Chiara, who is now Policy and Advocacy Manager for Women’s Economic Rights at Womankind in London, corporate tax is a feminist matter and a huge potential source of empowerment for women, if given the chance to learn about, and organize around it.

KELLER AND KATHERINE CHIGLINSKY Bloomberg News First Published Sep 13 2016 07:42PM    •    Last Updated Sep 13 2016 07:42 pm Share This Article Wells Fargo & Co. lost its title as the world's most valuable bank to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Wells Fargo, which is grappling with the fallout from claims that its employees created fake customer accounts, slumped 3.3 percent to close at $46.96 Tuesday in New York. That reduced the firm's market value to $236.9 billion, compared with $240.3 billion for New York-based JPMorgan. Wells Fargo was fined $185 million last week after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau accused bank employees of creating deposit and credit-card accounts without clients' approval to reach sales goals. Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf has been asked to testify in Washington about the alleged misconduct, while the San Francisco-based bank agreed to eliminate sales goals for retail bankers, effective Jan. 1. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "The company's operations are being impacted by the investigation," Piper Jaffray Cos. analysts led by Kevin Barker said Tuesday in a note. "The financial tailwind from the sales mishaps was immaterial to the company's fee revenue, but the elimination of product sales goals could materially change how the company's retail banking segment operates and the fee revenue it generates." Bank stocks also were pressured Tuesday as traders reduced bets that the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates at next week's meeting. JPMorgan fell 0.8 percent, while the 24-company KBW Bank Index slid 1.6 percent, extending its decline for the year to 2.7 percent. Wells Fargo and JPMorgan are among the top 20 largest firms by market capitalization globally. Apple Inc., the biggest, is valued at more than $582 billion, while Google parent Alphabet Inc. is second at $531 billion.   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES It's not easy being black at BYU, film shows NHL: Coyotes F Brad Richardson carted off ice on stretcher Utah lawmakers: Time to take 'training wheels' off booming solar industry, retire tax credit Garrison Keillor: Politics is not everything.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search JPMorgan: The Markets are Selling Off Today Because of BoJ September 13, 2016 1:16pm NYSE:SPY ShareTweet JPMorgan Chase analyst Adam Crisafulli just published some interesting notes explaining the causes of the broad market sell-off we’re experiencing today. In a research note to clients, Crisafulli says: The SPX is giving back the entire Mon rally due to ongoing yield anxiety ahead of the 9/21 BOJ meeting. The market never had a Fed problem but it does face a BOJ one and unfortunately clarity on Japanese monetary policy won’t come for another week (the comprehensive assessment is 9/21, the same day as the FOMC decision). … Other than this issue there isn’t much else to talk about and that is another headwind (the death of news is helping yield-driven fears to propagate uncontested). In addition to the focus on yields and multiples, the contours of the US presidential race shifted materially over the weekend and polls due out over the balance of this week and next will prob. reflect that (i.e. polls will prob. tighten further and Clinton’s +3 RCP average may wind up disappearing).” As for the bond market purge: Nothing really “happened” to spark the yield rise but the same old worries are playing a role, namely anxiety ahead of the BOJ meeting 9/21. Portugal’s 10yr yields are up ~9bp and in focus ahead of the DBRS 10/21 decision (a d/g from DBRS would render Portuguese bonds ineligible for the ECB APP). In the US Treasury yields are higher across the curve and the curve is steepening (2, 5, 10, and 30yr yields are up 1, 3, 4, and 3.7bp, respectively). So while most investors are focused on next week’s Federal Reserve meeting, Crisafulli says the markets are experiencing anxiety instead from the Bank of Japan. That central bank is reportedly reconsidering its entire policy stance as evidence mounts that Abenomics may not actually be working, and that negative interest rates may be a mistake. Unlike on Monday this week, stocks are not recovering from an early drop. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) fell $3.82 (-1.77%) to $212.58 per share in Tuesday afternoon trading, hitting fresh session lows and erasing all of Monday’s bounce after Friday’s big sell-off.

Search Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Menu Read Next Article GAO airs 3 bags of ACA exchange dirty laundry Email LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Google+ Share This Story Filed Under:Health Insurance, Ltci Jamie Dimon says it’s time for Fed to raise interest rates The JPMorgan Chase CEO makes the case that a 'return to normal is a good thing' Sep 13, 2016 | By Hugh Son Email LinkedIn Twitter Facebook Google+ Share This Story Dimon said his company is like a "mini police state" when it comes to tracking employees' digital behavior. (Photo: Paul Sakuma/AP) (Bloomberg) — JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the Federal Reserve should increase interest rates — sooner, rather than later. “Let’s just raise rates,” Dimon said Monday during a wide-ranging discussion at the Economic Club of Washington. “The Fed has to maintain credibility. I think it’s time to raise rates. Normality is a good thing, not a bad thing. The return to normal is a good thing.” Fed policy makers will gather in Washington Sept. 20-21, and recent comments from voting members have sent mixed signals about whether they’ll lift rates or wait at least until the December meeting. Speaking Monday in Chicago, Fed Governor Lael Brainard said “the case to tighten policy pre-emptively is less compelling” in an environment where declining unemployment has been slow to spur faster inflation. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, a voting member this year on the Federal Open Market Committee, argued Friday there was a reasonable case for gradual tightening. Related: MetLife says volatility challenges IPO path for retail unit Dimon, CEO and chairman of the biggest U.S. bank, isn’t a disinterested party. Banks typically make more money when interest rates rise as the gap widens between how much they charge borrowers and pay depositors. The shares of banks have climbed this year on days when speculation rises that the Fed is closer to increasing rates. “I’d go sooner rather than later, but I’ll leave the exact timing up to them,” Dimon said. White House In a conversation that touched on topics from regulation to U.S. immigration policy to the highlights of his more than three decades in finance, Dimon lambasted the lack of educational opportunities for inner-city residents as a “disgrace.” When asked if he would ever enter politics, Dimon, 60, said he would “love to be president” but the path is too difficult. It’s likely some of the regulations enacted under the Dodd-Frank Act will be improved in coming years, Dimon said, adding that he isn’t in favor of throwing it out entirely. When asked about cyber-security pressures, the CEO said JPMorgan was a like a “mini police state” in tracking employee behavior, and that he fires staffers every week for violating policies. JPMorgan spends $600 million annually on cyber security, a figure that could rise to $1 billion in a few years, he said. Dimon, who was treated for throat cancer in 2014, said he’s in good health and will probably be CEO for another five years. Related: How do you define bond liquidity?

JPMorgan Chase has surpassed Wells Fargo as the biggest U.S. bank by market capitalization. Wells Fargo had been the largest by market cap since 2013, based on closing values. Shares of Wells Fargo fell more 3 percent on Tuesday, while JPMorgan Chase closed 0.79 percent lower. That gave JPMorgan Chase a market cap of nearly $240.3 billion versus almost $236.9 billion for Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo shares have been under pressure in the past few days after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and two other regulators fined the bank $185 million. The bank must also pay another $5 million to customers for creating more than 2 million fake accounts for products like credit and debit cards to meet aggressive sales targets. On Tuesday, the bank said beginning next year it would eliminate all product sales goals in retail banking. With Tuesday's declines, Wells Fargo saw its worst daily performance since June 24 and its first three-day losing streak since Aug. 3. —CNBC's Gina Francolla and Reuters contributed to this report.

From left: Niko Papastefanou, Kristy Cloetingh, A.J. Scordio and Kevin Barbaro Port Washington native develops TV show By the age of 24, A.J. Scordio had it all. A graduate of Bucknell University, he had a highly coveted Wall Street job at JPMorgan Chase and was having the time of his life in New York City weekend after weekend with friends. But despite the luxurious assets at his fingertips, ultimately, they held him back from chasing his dream. Nowadays things have changed for the Port Washington native, who is in the midst of achieving the dream of becoming a filmmaker after quitting his office job to take a leap of faith. “I just felt very stuck there, and I was very unhappy,” said Scordio, when asked about his decision to leave a great paying job. “I began taking more acting and writing classes while working there and then after saving up enough money, I made the decision to switch careers and I quit.” Now the owner of his own production company, Scordio Productions, he hopes to become one of the competitive industry’s brightest up-and-comers. “I’ve always wanted to do something in film, even in high school,” said Scordio, who attended Paul D. Schreiber Senior High School. “I was a jock and was very into business so I wanted to take the practical route, but the passion was always deep down and that’s why I was always a part of the high school plays.” Meet the cast of Long Island Lights. From left: Kristy Cloetingh, Niko Papastefanou, A.J. Scordio, Martin Yurkovic and Kevin Barbaro Having directed music videos for world renowned DJs Steve Aoki and Felix Jaehn as well as producing numerous commercials for locations of the fitness empire CrossFit, Scordio has now turned his sights to something bigger. Within the film industry, “bigger” usually means Hollywood, but for Scordio, “bigger” means Long Island. With help from cowriters Mary Martin and Alex Aguirre, Scordio and his team have created Long Island Lights, described as “a new comedic TV show about a group of misfits at an amateur production company on Long Island who learn life lessons as they stumble towards their idea of Hollywood success.” Paralleling numerous life moments Scordio has gone through, the series revolves around brothers James and Marco Agnelli, portrayed by Scordio himself and Niko Papastefanou, half-siblings Rick and Vicky Sellers, played by Kevin Barbaro and Kristy Cloetingh, and finally Donny Martin, portrayed by Martin Yurkovic. Scordio said that it was important that the series is based in the area in which he grew up, which made him want to bring Hollywood to Long Island. With the show based on the Island, the crew has filmed numerous scenes in Port Washington, Huntington, Baiting Hollow and Riverhead, as well as Brooklyn and Times Square. Kevin Barbaro (driver) and A.J. Scordio (passenger) get ready to film a scene while driving. The show premiered its pilot episode June 12 in front of a packed theater of more than 250 people. At the end of the episode, the cast and crew were met with praises from the crowd as well as great reviews and loud ovations. Scordio and his team are scheduled to meet with Hulu representatives in September, an opportunity he is excited about. “I know it’s going to happen. I’ve put so much into this show and surrounded myself with people that want the same dream,” said Scordio. He plans to do his best in selling himself and the show to those that have the power to bring Long Island Lights to the next level. When asked if he had any advice for people who want to chase their dreams much like he did, he said that the most important thing is being able to support yourself and having the support of those that matter, like parents. “My parents, Patricia Dalmazio and Anthony Scordio, are entrepreneurs, so although they have no idea about the entertainment industry, they have always been supportive of me pursuing my dream,” Scordio said.

Embed from Getty Images   Bloomberg News reports that the New York court on Monday reversed a judge’s decision to throw out the lawsuit and ordered him to consider the case. Jennifer Sharkey sued in 2010 claiming she was fired as a vice president in J.P. Morgan’s Private Wealth Management Group for investigating allegations that a long-term client might be involved in fraud or money-laundering. According to Sharkey, she was fired one week after making a formal recommendation that the bank end its relationship with the Israeli client after spending months warning about possible illegal activity. The person wasn’t named in the lawsuit and is referred to in court papers as "Client A."

A benchmark for near-term borrowing, the three-month U.S. dollar London interbank offered rate, has risen above 0.75 percentage point. That’s a key threshold for junk-rated companies with about $230 billion of loans outstanding according to data compiled by Bloomberg -- with Libor above that level, the borrowers will have to pay more interest over time. The increase so far could amount to about an extra $230 million of total interest expense annually for the companies. Companies that took out floating-rate loans knew they would have to pay more to borrow once rates started rising, but they haven’t experienced real increases for years. Even when the Federal Reserve started hiking rates in December, many companies did not have to pay higher rates on their loans until Libor breached key levels, because of the way their floating rates are calculated. Rising interest payments would only add to pain for U.S. borrowers that are already suffering from falling profits and higher default rates. And Libor could rise further-- JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists recently forecast it could reach 0.95 percentage point by the end of this month. There will be some companies “for which it might become an issue," said Neha Khoda, a high-yield credit strategist at Bank of America Corp. With Libor having risen above key levels like 0.75 percentage point, many issuers have to think about how they will pay the extra interest, she said. Three-month Libor now stands at 0.85 percentage point, and has been rising as new money market fund rules curb investor demand for companies’ short-term debt.  Interest rates on loans in the leveraged loan market are calculated by starting with a benchmark borrowing rate like three-month Libor and adding a margin known as a "spread." About $230 billion of the loans in the market have a minimum benchmark level, or "floor," equal to 0.75 percentage point, meaning that even if Libor has fallen below that level, the borrower must pay the minimum plus the spread. Most of the debt in the $900 billion leveraged loan market has Libor floors, which are often set around 1 percent.  ‘Rational Decision’ Floors grew popular when interest rates started plunging after the crisis, and are meant to cushion lenders against falling rates. Many companies have a combination of fixed- and floating-rate obligations, and the variable-rate debt can be hedged to reduce exposure to interest rates. Libor is rising in anticipation of  new rules for money market funds that go into effect in October. Under the regulations, investors in funds that buy short-term corporate obligations can suffer losses when the value of the assets falls. Funds that only invest in short-term government debt are not subject to the new rules, which has made government-only money market funds much more popular in recent months. As investors have had less demand for funds that invest in short-term corporate debt obligations, issuers have had to boost yields, lifting benchmark rates. Libor’s rise is also a function of changes to the way the rate is calculated after years of scandals revealed flaws in the method for setting the levels, according to Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Brean Capital LLC. “There’s been a huge focus on the regulatory changes but the way Libor has been calculated has been changing and that has a lot to do with the rise too,” he said Tuesday by phone. “This is why we think Libor is going to continue to be elevated relative to other rates and why we think investors should boost exposure to floating rate notes.” Some borrowers may look to change the benchmark rates on their loans to switch to lower baselines, such as one-month Libor, said Craig Russ, a portfolio manager at Eaton Vance Corp. that invests in loans. Advanced Disposal Services Inc., the Ponte Vedra, Florida-based waste manager, did so earlier this year, according to e-mailed comments from the company. The company had a $1.69 billion loan with a floor on three-month Libor of 0.75 percentage point. In the second quarter, it switched to one-month Libor, which is currently 0.53 percentage point. Advanced Disposal has posted at least five years of annual net losses according to Bloomberg data. It has filed for an initial public offering whose proceeds would help pay down debt. Whether the one-month Libor rises like the three-month and six-month rates did remains an “open question”, according to JPMorgan Chase analysts led by Alex Roever. But it still may make sense for many companies to try switching to one-month Libor to increase their chances of their benchmark staying below their floor, Eaton Vance’s Russ said.  "It’s a rational economic decision to lower your costs,” Russ said. “If you’re the CFO of a company, you’ll probably want to prevent yourself going above the Libor floor.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

 JAMIE DIMON: 'I would love to be president of the United States' Bob Bryan Sep. 12, 2016, 1:18 PM 24,844 facebook linkedin twitter email print Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon wants to live in the White House, but he doesn't think it will happen. In a Monday conversation at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C., Dimon was asked by David Rubenstein, the head of the Economic Club, whether he would run for political office. "I would love to be president of the United States, but it's too hard and too late," Dimon replied. Dimon said that while the campaign of the real-estate mogul turned Republican nominee Donald Trump appeared to make it possible for a "businessman who had never held office before" to be successful in a run for the presidency, the expectation of voters for a presidential candidate to have served in office before taking over the White House would prevent him from winning. Dimon said "you have to join a party" and "be a senator and governor" first to qualify in voters' minds, which he does not plan to do. He also cited Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, as an example of a businessman who opted not to run for president. Dimon nevertheless seemed exasperated with the state of economic policymaking in Washington, saying the US didn't need more "Democratic and Republican bulls---." At the same time, Dimon reiterated his view that the US remained the world's strongest economy. "America has the best hand ever dealt of any country on this planet today ever," Dimon said. He said that the US had geographical, economic, and military advantages over every other country and that Americans "don't fully appreciate" that fact. Dimon also expressed his opinion on the state of economic policy. On the monetary side, he said he thought the Federal Reserve should raise interest rates. On the fiscal side, he believes there should be government stimulus, a decrease in the corporate tax rates, and easing of regulations. Dimon has frequently commented on macroeconomic events and policy, and the JPMorgan CEO's name has long been floated as a possible candidate for Treasury secretary. Monday was the first time he had explicitly stated his desire to hold the highest office in the US.

Login Search U.S. Import Prices Declined in August -- Update September 14, 2016, 10:37:00 AM EDT By Dow Jones Business News Shutterstock photo By Anna Louie Sussman WASHINGTON -- The price of foreign imports to the U.S. fell in August as petroleum prices declined, a sign historically low oil prices continue to weigh on inflation. But the decrease from year-ago prices was the smallest since October 2014 and has been generally dwindling each month, suggesting prices of overseas goods could be slowly stabilizing as the strength of the U.S. dollar fades. Import prices, measuring costs for everything from Mexican vegetables to Japanese cars, fell 0.2% in August from a month earlier, the Labor Department said Wednesday. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected a 0.1% decrease in August. From a year earlier, import prices were down 2.2% in August. Compare that to August 2015, as oil was on its downward slide. Import prices then had stood 11.4% below their year-ago level. Import prices haven't increased on an annual basis in over two years, thanks largely to oil prices that tumbled in mid-2014 and are still far from the above $100-a-barrel prices that reigned for the prior three years. Excluding petroleum, prices of all other imports were flat in August from July. Another factor has been the strength of the U.S. dollar, which has dissipated since the end of last year, save for a brief rally following the Brexit vote. "Though the August reading was softer than expected, the trend in nonfuel import prices has improved in recent months as the drag from earlier increases in the dollar has faded," said Zina Bushra Saijid, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Import prices tend to be more volatile than broader consumer prices. After declining in 2015 and early this year, the price index rose for five straight months until August. But non-petroleum import prices have only risen twice on a monthly basis since early 2014, in May and July of this year. In July, import prices rose 0.1% from the prior month. Unlike most measures of inflation, import prices aren't adjusted for seasonality. August's decrease was led by a fall in petroleum prices. The price of petroleum imports fell 2.8% in August and was down 12.9% from a year earlier. Global crude oil prices in August ranged from around $40 to $50, well above lows under $ 30 a barrel reached in the early months of the year, according to the Energy Department. Prices for non-petroleum industrial supplies rose 0.6% in August and foods, feeds and beverage prices were down 0.5%. Prices for imported vehicles and parts fell 0.2% for the second straight month. Federal Reserve officials, who meet Sept. 20-21 to discuss monetary policy, have been watching for signs of inflation. The Fed has been counting on inflation to slowly rise, indicating the economy is growing at a healthy pace and can withstand an increase in interest rates, which the central bank has kept historically low since the recession to stimulate growth. The price of imported goods can influence broader inflation measures, but aren't the only factor. The consumer- price index rose 0.8% from a year earlier in July. The Labor Department will release the August CPI reading on Friday. The central bank's preferred measure of inflation, the personal-consumption expenditures price index, has undershot the Fed's 2% target for more than four years. On Monday, three Federal Reserve officials suggested in separate speeches and an interview they're in no hurry to raise short-term interest rates at their policy meeting next week. Fed governor Lael Brainard said in a speech the central bank's caution on rates "has served us well in recent months, helping to support continued gains in employment and progress on inflation." But she noted that strong employment gains haven't yet pushed up wages and inflation as much as would have been expected in the past. Their comments appeared to contrast with those of other officials who have suggested in recent weeks they could consider a Fed rate increase this month. Together, they suggest a lack of consensus on whether to move at their next meeting. Meanwhile, Wednesday's report showed export prices fell 0.8% in August, the largest drop since January, as prices fell for both agricultural exports and nonagricultural exports such as cars and capital goods. Overall export prices were down 2.4% in August from a year earlier. The Labor Department report on import and export prices can be accessed at: http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ ximpim.toc.htm.

Sonja Morgan’s Big Apple home has practically been a character of its own this season on The Real Housewives of New York City. Castmate Luann de Lesseps stayed in it with Morgan for several episodes, and viewers delighted watching the two read about themselves in the New York Post after a night of partying. Photo: Bravo Now, only ET takes you inside Morgan Manor! The ‘straw that stirs the drink’ herself showed us her stunning 4,500-square-foot home exclusively. It features five bedrooms, five-and-a-half bathrooms and an outdoor garden. “[Outdoor space] is what I really need,” she says. “Living in New York and spending a lot of time here since my divorce, that's been a godsend.” (Morgan’s ex is John Adams Morgan, whose family is behind J.P. Morgan Chase. The two split in 2006 before Morgan joined the show.) EXCLUSIVE: See Inside Bethenny Frankel’s Stunning Hamptons Home!  Morgan herself sleeps on the third floor, and the entire level is a master suite. She keeps her pricey Birkin bags locked in closets for safety; though tells ET some of the most costly items in her home are her shoes, which cost “anywhere from $10-12,000.” Morgan says viewers haven’t even seen her priciest pieces on TV! “I don't wear lavish clothing on the show because I don't want to destroy my good things,” she says. “I've had Christian Dior shawls that I just put down for a second on the bar and then a housewife comes over and puts their purse on top of it! … Things go missing too. We have kleptomania on the show.” One line of clothing she does wear for the cameras: her own Sonja Morgan New York, but according to Morgan those items get nabbed by house guests too! Morgan says de Lesseps has one of her red jumpsuits right now. Guests (including de Lesseps) stay on the fifth floor. Though, no need to lug bags up all the stairs: there’s a hidden elevator! The Tipsy Girl Prosecco entrepreneur has plenty of space for her beloved interns to stay too, and her daughter, Quincy, has friends over for sleepovers. It’s a lot to maintain – so would she ever sell the manor? EXCLUSIVE: Luann de Lesseps Reveals Why She Forgave Her Cheating Fiance  “It's the best zip code in the universe,” she says. “So why would I sell right now with the markets the way it is? … But with my daughter away I'd really like to have less. A duplex with a garden would be manageable. … I'm very emotionally attached to the history I have here because I decorated everything myself and my daughter was born here. … So, it's a big decision at this age and a lot of moms go through this when kids go off to school. Do you want to scale down? It's hard. It's really hard.” There are years of memories in the house, and it’s been filmed in plenty. One issue that came up on camera while de Lesseps was living there was how much the ladies partied. “Oh god, every night was crazy,” Morgan says. “With Luann, I can't keep up!” Morgan’s drinking became a hot topic on Housewives this season, with some of the other women saying her drinking was out of control and excluding her from girls’ trips as a result. Morgan laid off the alcohol and mended friendships, but tells ET the chatter was hurtful – especially when it came from Dorinda Medley and Ramona Singer. EXCLUSIVE: Dorinda Medley Fires Back at Sonja Morgan’s Drug Use Allegations  “I'm very hurt by Ramona, when I saw the filming after the fact,” she says. “I go back and watch the show, what they were saying when I wasn't with them, and Ramona was not supportive.” Morgan also clarifies: “I was never 'sober' -- I just stopped partying! I gave up hard alcohol and partying. I didn't touch a drop of liquor for, probably, eight or nine months, but I'd have a cognac or a glass of red wine on a date. But that's not partying, and I'm certainly not touching a drop around [the housewives] or in public … because you can't have anything for them to talk about.” It’s been a season of drama, lauded by many fans as one of the best Real Housewives of New York seasons ever, and it concludes Wednesday night with the finale of the three-part reunion special on Bravo.

Friday November 18, 2016 Analysis Argentina Community Economy World Culture Media Sports English on the Side   Wednesday, September 14, 2016 CEOs: country must be transformed DON MACRI. It was a busy day for Mauricio Macri, who delivered a keynote address at 9am before holding a series of whistlestop meetings with business leaders. The president shared a series of snaps on Twitter, where he was often seated in a leather armchair looking somewhat relaxed as he pondered the musings of the company executives. By Ignacio Portes Herald Staff Speakers at investment forum say gov’t should deliver new business-friendly legislation The massive Business and Investment Forum organized by Mauricio Macri’s administration in downtown Buenos Aires finally kicked off yesterday, with an estimated 2,000 people in attendance as some of the world’s most influential executives called on the government to deepen the reforms undertaken since the president took office in December. Business leaders seemed to agree that an opportunity to lead Argentina’s transformation into a country close to their liking is up for grabs, and the government said it was working to further that goal. “There is a strong (political) leadership here, but the leadership of the country is in this room,” IBM’s Bruno Di Leo told a packed main auditorium at the the CCK cultural centre, urging them to keep pushing for change following the direction of the government’s recent reforms. Minutes after him, Production Minister Francisco Cabrera told the same audience that “I was one of you up to 2007, when I joined Macri’s project. This is why I understand you, I understand what you are looking for. I know you have seen that there’s a wind of change, but we want to show more changes are coming, and that this is the time to invest in Argentina,” he said. The minister, who previously worked with banking giant HSBC, financial holding Grupo Roberts and local media firm La Nación, went on to name a long list of reforms carried out by the government, from cuts to export duties to unencumbered distribution of firms’ dividends to foreign headquarters, and promised that many more changes would follow, including a tax reform, the reduction of red tape, an “intelligent integration to the world ... the reduction of capital costs ... improvements in human resources” and the “promotion of innovation and technology.” Cabrera was clearly on the same page as most of the other speakers. JP Morgan’s Martin Marron, Inter-American Investment Corporation’s James Scriben and International Finance Corporation’s Dimitris Tsitsiragos all highlighted that there was significant overlap between what they thought were priorities for the country and Cabrera’s to-do list, although some of them added some requests. According to Tsitsiragos, pension savings (currently controlled by the state’s ANSES social security agency) need to be used for capital investment, and the fiscal deficit needs to be reined in. Global investment banking giant Goldman Sachs’ Marc Nachmann also warned about the deficit, and called for continuing reforms at speed. Overall however, agreements dominated, sometimes markedly so. Cabrera even joked about how Marron made a more passionate case for a bright Argentine business future than himself, after the JP Morgan executive said his firm decided to open a hub in Buenos Aires on December 2014, beating other potential locations in Asia, the US and Europe. “The main reason for that decision is there’s a deep pool of young talent in this country. People who just came out of universities or who are working in business. Argentina also ranks number one at the Education First (EF) English Proficiency Index (EPI) in Latin America. There are strong academic and English skills in young people in this country. And there’s even a time zone alignment with the US, which is great for business,” Marron said. Persuading the cash-holders Much of the government’s words were focused on convincing those present that Argentina is a greatly profitable investment opportunity. “You are in the right place at the perfect moment,” Macri said in a speech opening the three-day conference yesterday. “We can’t change everything in a day or in a year or during one presidency,” he added. “What’s important is that we’ve starting going in the right direction.” The CEOs were sceptical about speeches per se. According to Andrew Liveris, Chairman and chief executive officer of The Dow Chemical Company, “talk fests are a waste of time. I go to these talk fests all the time. It is important to do, not to talk.” But Liveris saw some reasons for optimism, saying Argentina is among the few countries changing the rules to make business simpler and that if the new rules were sustained over time “there could be sustainable growth for decades. Liveris added that “there’s stuff below the ground (natural resources) and men above the ground (human resources). That allows for value added production, which few countries can do. The US shale industry is a good example. Develop shale gas, fast, it will pay for a lot of bills.” His words were in line with those of Marron, who said “people always think of natural resources but people are really valuable. In today’s world it is no longer about natural resources, it’s about societies. (The economic development of) Singapore, South Korea, Sillicon Valley are good examples of this. Firms such as Globant and Mercado Libre in Argentina invested heavily on human talent here (and were successful).” But some also mentioned factors they considered as “risky”: unions and governments. A local CEO, Techint’s Paolo Rocca, told the audience that they should not worry, praising Macri for vetoing non business-friendly laws, arguing that the opposition had largely abandoned “populist” views and saying “unions will understand” that if they cede some ground society overall will “benefit.” @ignacioportes Size email Print Share Vote Tweets por @BAHeraldcom Get to File LATEST NEWS MOST POPULAR BEST RANKED The writer who came in from the cold Zooming in on fictional spaces.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search If You’re Wary of Emerging Market Bond Funds, Consider Bank Loan Funds September 14, 2016 4:41pm NYSE:EMB NYSE:FTSL ShareTweet From David Fabian: There is no doubt that 2016 has been a good year for ETF investors directing their capital towards income-generating asset classes.  The combination of a rising stock market and falling interest rates have helped push prices higher across virtually every segment of the economy. This of course has depressed current yields.  But on a total return basis, you are looking fairly good as long as you didn’t do something foolish like sell in February and remain in cash. In early August, I wrote an article about the scarcity of value in income generating ETFs due in large part to this broad push higher.  It essentially broke down the current landscape from both a yield and performance category across stocks, bonds, and alternative assets.  I like to analyze these trends to pinpoint areas that look overheated and those that may offer greater hope for the future. The two strongest income producing sectors were emerging market bonds and REITs.  Obviously these areas were showing signs of technical strength, but also give me pause for their susceptibility to a sharper pullback.  Much of the momentum has been driven by a stretch for yield, for example, the iShares JPMorgan USD Emerging Market Bond Fund ETF (NYSE:EMB), and a perception of low-volatility and safety (REITs).  Two trends that can easily turn and catch late-adopters off guard if interest rates attempt even a modest nudge higher. Furthermore, the areas of slow growth or outright negative returns were centered on international dividend paying stocks and master limited partnerships.  Both of these sectors potentially offer greater long-term value on a relative basis, but are also much higher up the risk scale as well. Right in the middle of the pack was an area I hadn’t considered in quite a while – bank loans.  These instruments became widely known during the 2013 taper tantrum as a potential way to sidestep rising interest rates.  Their weakness is more aligned with credit risk and liquidity (smaller market) than a typical investment grade fixed-income security. These debt instruments go by many different names, i.e. senior loans, leveraged loans, bank loans, or floating rate notes.  They are predominantly issued by companies with a below investment grade rating, and carry floating coupon rates.  The coupon rate is typically indexed to a widely followed interest rate index, such as 3-month LIBOR. One of the advantages of these floating rate securities is that coupon floors exist so as rates fall investors still receive respectable income.  However, as interest rates rise, the commensurate coupon rate can also rise, which can increase the mark-to-market value of the security.  Lastly, the effective duration is typically tied to the security’s reset rate, which is typically no longer than 60-90 days. A widely-followed proxy for the bank loan market is the PowerShares Senior Loan Portfolio (BKLN).  This ETF has $5.4 billion invested in an index of just over 100 loans using a market-cap weighted methodology.  BKLN has a 30-day SEC yield of 5.45% and income is paid monthly to shareholders. Two other available options are the SPDR Blackstone / GSO Senior Loan ETF(SRLN) and First Trust Senior Loan Fund (FTSL).  Both of these ETFs are actively managed funds with a broader number of holdings and over three years of trading history. We recently opted to purchase a starter position in FTSL for clients in our Strategic Income Portfolio after a thorough analysis of the strengths and weaknesses each fund brings to the table.  Primarily, we believe that the broader diversification, credit research, and flexibility of an active fund is an advantage in this unique sector.  FTSL has been one of the better performing funds over the last several years and currently carries an outsized cash position that we believe will be an advantage moving forward. In our opinion, the relative under performance of bank loans this year combined with the potential for a sideways to uptrend in interest rates offer an attractive opportunity.  This is particularly acute after taking profits from other highly appreciated sectors of the fixed-income and alternative income markets that added to our healthy cash position. We are also pleased to note that this sector has remained stable throughout the uptick in Treasury yields over the last several months. Make no mistake – bank loans are not a panacea for the specter rising interest rates and several other opportunities exist that are directly correlated to the price movement of Treasury yields.  These loans still carry noteworthy credit risk, similar to high yield bonds, which is a characteristic that we regularly evaluate.  Investors should also be mindful that actively managed funds in this category carry a premium in their embedded expenses due to the cost of maintaining the non-index strategy. Our goal is to use these tools to supplement our existing fixed-income positionsand deploy capital in areas that we feel offer greater reward potential than cash or conventional bonds.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    A bond rally fed by a decade of stimulus may be losing its legs in the developed world, but in some of the biggest emerging markets, easing is just getting started. As the last days of near-zero Federal Reserve rates cause convulsions in global markets, JPMorgan Chase & Co., Pacific Investment Management Co. and Societe Generale SA are touting the bonds of countries riding a wave of stimulus, this time of their own making. Both banks have pinpointed Brazil, Indonesia and Russia, where policy makers are forecast to deliver some of the biggest rates cuts over the next year. The prospect for monetary easing will help engineer bond rallies in local markets after record inflows brought yields on developing-nation debt to the lowest in at least six years last month. At 4.28 percent, they’re still almost four percentage points higher than the average for Group of Seven nations, according to Bloomberg indexes. “We like the high-yielding part of emerging-market local bonds because they have fundamental support from falling inflation and central banks which are starting or in the middle of easing cycles,” said Jonny Goulden, who heads local emerging-market debt research at JPMorgan in London. “Even if the Fed is hiking slowly, arguably Brazilian policy rates and Russian policy rates will be coming down as inflation falls in these countries.” JPMorgan advises clients take more exposure than benchmarks suggest to local currency bonds of Brazil, Colombia, Russia and Indonesia. Societe Generale strategists also recommend local-currency government bonds of Russia and Brazil, as well as India, and dollar-denominated notes of Brazil, Colombia and Indonesia. Russian inflation has slowed to the lowest in more than two years, giving the nation’s central bank the leeway to cut its benchmark 50 basis points to 10 percent when it meets Friday, and a further 200 basis points the end of September 2017, according to Bloomberg surveys. Brazil Beckons Brazilian policy makers are also projected to start cutting their key rate from 14.25 percent, where they’ve held it for more than a year. By the end of next year, economists see 300 basis points of rate cuts in response to a slowdown in consumer price growth by almost half. “We like the story in Brazil where the central bank is looking for the right conditions to cut rates,” said Lupin Rahman, portfolio manager for emerging markets at Pimco in London. Bonds of Argentina, Brazil and Indonesia are “top picks” for Viktor Szabo, a money manager who helps run $11 billion of emerging-market debt at Aberdeen Asset Management in London. “Further weakness would create an opportunity to top up, but we are far from those levels,” Szabo said. --With assistance from Stephen Kirkland To contact the reporters on this story: Lyubov Pronina in London at lpronina@bloomberg.net, Cecile Gutscher in London at cgutscher@bloomberg.net.

Bayer will pay $128 a share in cash, the company said in a statement yesterday. The bid – this year’s biggest deal and the largest foreign takeover ever by a German company – is 21 percent above Monsanto’s closing price on Tuesday in New York. Bayer also agreed to pay Monsanto a break-up fee of $2 billion if the deal is rejected on antitrust grounds. The transaction caps a dramatic reshaping of the crop and seed industry. A year ago, the sector had at least a half-dozen global players. After Bayer and Monsanto tie up, creating a leader with $26 billion in combined revenue from agriculture, that number will shrink to just four. Falling crop prices and a quest for greater efficiency have triggered a cascade of deals over the past year. Last December DuPont Co. and Dow Chemical Co. agreed to merge and then carve out a new crop-science unit. And in February, China National Chemical Corp. agreed to acquire Switzerland’s Syngenta AG, which Monsanto had pursued for years. The deal values Monsanto at almost 21 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares to a median of about 9.4 times for comparable deals. Bayer will fund the transaction with a combination of debt and equity. The equity component of about $19 billion will be raised through an issuance of mandatory convertible bonds as well as a rights offer. In the meantime, Bank of America Corp., Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. agreed to provide bridge financing of $57 billion. Bank of America, Credit Suisse and Rothschild & Co. advised Bayer on the transaction, while Morgan Stanley and Ducera Partners LLC acted for Monsanto. Taking advantage of a decline in Monsanto’s share price, Bayer, based in the industrial city of Leverkusen, first made an unsolicited offer of $122 a share in May, and then in July bumped that to $125. Both proposals were rejected by Monsanto, but the company granted access to some financial accounts to conduct due diligence. Last week, Bayer made a third offer of $127.50, setting off the next round of negotiations that led to the agreement. To hear Bayer and Monsanto executives speak on a media conference call at 3.30 p.m. CET, click here. The transaction, which values shares of Monsanto at about $56 billion, will add to core earnings per share in the first full year after the deal closes, likely at the end of next year, Bayer said. The combined seeds business will remain headquartered in St. Louis. Shares of Monsanto rose 0.4 percent to $106.50 in trading before the opening of U.S. markets. Bayer climbed almost 4 percent to 96.64 euros in Frankfurt. Buying Monsanto will allow Bayer to tap growing demand as farmers seek to boost productivity to feed an estimated 10 billion people globally by 2050. The deal gives Bayer more than 2,000 varieties of seeds for crops such as corn, soybeans, and wheat. Adding that portfolio to its own vegetable, rice, cotton, and oilseed offerings give Bayer a virtually unassailable position at the head of the market. In the past two decades Monsanto has pioneered the commercialization of genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. GMO varieties of corn and soybeans now account for more than 90 percent of those crops in the U.S., but have faced strong opposition from consumers across Europe and are banned or tightly controlled in many countries. That may account for the high break-up fee. The combined company could account for more than 30 percent of the global crop-inputs business, stoking concern that the deal could be rejected by competition authorities. The recent industry consolidation also leaves fewer buyers for any assets Bayer-Monsanto might need to sell to satisfy regulators. Founded in 1901, Monsanto in the past also produced pharmaceuticals and industrial chemicals, including toxic substances such as polychlorinated biphenyls, now banned and commonly known as PCBs, and the herbicide Agent Orange, which was used by the U.S. military in Vietnam. Bayer, founded in 1863, trademarked the name “heroin” as a cough remedy in 1896 and then introduced aspirin – the first true blockbuster drug – in 1899.

CDT September 14, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Forget about the $185 million fine Wells Fargo (WFC) agreed to pay for secretly opening millions of accounts without customers' permission. Here's something that really stings: Wells Fargo just lost the title as the most valuable U.S. bank for the first time in three years. It's now second behind JP Morgan Chase (JPM). Shares of Wells Fargo dropped $1.58, or 3.3%, to $46.96 Tuesday after the bank continues to be in damage-control mode connected with its settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The fine is only a tiny fraction of the company's annual profit. But the stock declines brings the market value of Wells Fargo down to $236.9 billion, a 21% decline from its nearly $300 billion value in mid-July. Wells Fargo's market premium has consistently made it more valuable than other U.S. banks the past five years, even though it's not the biggest in terms of revenue and profit. Wells Fargo was worth 14% more than JP Morgan at the end of 2015, but it posted nearly 7% less revenue of $83.7 billion. The bank's ability to have broad financial relationships with customers, many having a checking account, savings account and mortgage, made it attractive to investors. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) is the largest owner of Wells Fargo stock with a 10% stake. Wells Fargo has consistently been worth more than JP Morgan Chase the past five years. (Photo: S&P Global Market Intelligence, USA TODAY)   But the tables have been turned in terms of stock market value at least. On Tuesday, shares of JP Morgan fell 53 cents, or 0.8%, to $66.53, less than the drop in Wells Fargo's shares. That gives JP Morgan, the bank with the most revenue, also the biggest market value of $240.3 billion among U.S. banks. Berkshire Hathaway has the largest market value of any company in the broader financial sector, which includes banks, in the Russell 1000 index. Most bank stocks have suffered the past two weeks. . The Select Sector SPDR Trust (XLF) exchange traded fund, which contains shares of leading financial firms, is down 2.7% from two weeks ago. But during that same period, Wells Fargo has suffered much more, dropping 7.2%.

Pomona lineman Jake Moretti, state’s top recruit, flips commitment from Ohio State to Colorado Broncos’ blocked kick game-winner was a rare perfect storm in the NFL Salida OK’s community of 200 tiny homes to help ease housing crunch Colorado is a state where business, government and nonprofit communities understand the value of working together to create opportunity for all, regardless of where they live or who they are. However, the state isn’t immune to the challenges of building ladders to economic success that others states face. One example of this is the economic future for young Coloradans. Less than one in four students entering high school today will obtain a college degree or post-secondary credential. Yet, college or formal training beyond high school is needed for nearly nine out of 10 good, well-paying jobs. In response to this, businesses, along with the public sector, are launching an innovative statewide youth apprenticeship program called CareerWise Colorado.  These apprenticeships will provide high school students paid work experience to gain essential skills in high-growth industries like information technology, finance, and advanced manufacturing while also earning college credit. Bloomberg Philanthropies and JPMorgan Chase are together investing $9.5 million in this new business-led initiative, which will prepare high school students for careers that both have growth potential and pay a good wage. The funding will also support an ongoing, successful pilot through Denver Public Schools’ CareerConnect and other districts statewide to equip students with the skills they need to succeed. Beginning next fall, high school juniors statewide will be able to choose apprenticeships that place them directly into paid, meaningful and productive positions with committed employers. These employers will see them through three years of training and prepare them directly for good careers or, if they choose, to continue their education. Students will spend up to half of their time on-site with employers while still earning credit toward high school graduation and post-secondary credentials. A third year of apprenticeship experience will further prepare students to enter the workforce directly or continue their education — supported by the wages they have earned along the way. The vision for CareerWise Colorado emerged from Colorado’s Business Experiential-Learning Commission, which studied the most effective youth apprenticeship systems across the globe. The commission committed to a sustainable model that will train and prepare 20,000 students from across Colorado as youth apprentices over the next 10 years to get them on track to good jobs and careers. Colorado is a national leader in developing innovative strategies to increase student achievement and improve opportunities beyond high school. Already, programs like DPS’s CareerConnect provide students with career exploration, coaching and mentoring to better prepare students for college and career. Their work will expand with support from these additional investments and will help an additional 9,000 Denver students over three years, many of whom will go on to participate in CareerWise apprenticeships. By working together, we are developing a scalable model that will become a gold standard for apprenticeship systems across the U.S. while improving the talent pipeline for critical industries and increasing educational attainment and opportunities for all Colorado youth. All while giving thousands of students real access to not just good jobs, but upwardly mobile careers. John Hickenlooper is governor of Colorado. Michael Bloomberg is the founder of Bloomberg LP and Bloomberg Philanthropies and was mayor of New York City from 2002 to 2013. Jamie Dimon is the Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Samuelson, Washington Post Writers Group Elections regularly inspire an orgy of hype — and so it is with this one. The Democrats are in disarray, it’s said. Unless they’re enormously skillful or lucky, they risk becoming a minority party indefinitely. Be skeptical. The reality is that these dire forecasts have a habit of not coming true. Remember... Dobbs: Since he was elected, Trump’s record isn’t reassuring November 16, 2016, 12:14 pm First, Donald Trump has said since he started his quest that he only uses “the best people.” Because the president-elect has zero experience, that is supposed to reassure us.
