He was echoed by Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, who linked Brexit-related issues to the problem of the European Union's survival. At the same time, he warned that the British referendum's results would have "broader long-term consequences". "Brexit is an alert signal indicating that the EU should change, but everyone is busy with their own problems and this complicates the situation," according to Chase Vittorio Grilli, former Italian Finance Minister and the current head of JP Morgan Chase's  European division.  I think people sometimes forget the importance of the Eurozone to the UK economy #Brexit #Trade #liamfox pic.twitter.com/GKcdgKVA0B — Ryan Boothroyd (@BoothroydRyan) 29 сентября 2016 г.

Hurricane Matthew is just off the east coast of Florida near Cape Canaveral, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory on Friday, after killing hundreds of people in Haiti on its move north through the Caribbean. Data modelling firm RMS told clients earlier this week its initial estimates were a 42 percent chance of a $20 billion insurance loss and a 26 percent chance of a $30 billion loss from the hurricane, a source familiar with the research said. Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week Ben Brookes, vice president capital markets at RMS told Reuters its guidance to clients was based on a single forecast, adding, "to project impact from this alone would be misleading. "We have continued to update our guidance as the situation changes," Brookes said, without giving further details. An estimate from Kinetic Analysis of insured losses of $25 billion would make Matthew "the second most costly hurricane in U.S. history behind Katrina", JPMorgan analysts said in a note late Thursday, referring to the hurricane which hit New Orleans and the surrounding coast in 2005. A Kinetic Analysis spokesman said its $25 billion estimate was made on Thursday and its current estimate was "considerably lower," without giving further detail. An empty highway is seen prior to the arrival of Hurricane Matthew in Miami Beach, Florida, October 6. Javier Galeano/Reuters Market participants were keeping a close track on the hurricane's movements. "People are looking at this literally every minute and working overnight on it," one trader said. The average impact to U.S. property and casualty insurers' book value from $10 billion to $30 billion of insured losses from the hurricane would equate to around a quarter's worth of earnings, the JPMorgan analysts added. Heritage Insurance Holdings gave a preliminary loss estimate on Friday of around $500 million. A $20 billion insured loss would match the insured losses caused by Hurricane Sandy in the northeast of the United States in 2012, which did not make landfall. A loss of this size would lead to "material risks" for Lloyd's of London insurers, analyst Ben Cohen at Canaccord Genuity said in a note on Friday. Cohen calculated a loss equivalent to Sandy would hit Beazley's earnings by $104 million, Hiscox's by 117 million pounds ($145 million) and Lancashire's by $39 million. Related Stories Hurricane Matthew Has Exacerbated the Debt We Owe Haiti Hurricane Kills Hundreds in Haiti, Lashes Florida Hurricane Matthew Truthers Claim Officials Hiding Data 'Everybody Was Affected:' Haitians Face Storm Damage Beazley estimates an $80 billion storm would cause a $200 million loss, a spokesman said, without specifying losses from a smaller disaster. A Hiscox spokeswoman said it was too early to judge the impact of the hurricane. A Lancashire spokesman also said it was early days, but the firm was feeling "relatively relaxed" about its losses because it was very lightly exposed to risk in Florida compared with other states in which it offers reinsurance for wind damage. The hurricane represented a "real test" of reinsurers' exposure, S&P Global said in a report, but it did not see a ratings impact, due to reinsurers' strong capital buffers.

Who We Are About the Magazine Irish America Team Our Contributors In This Issue Archives Hall of Fame The Lists Business 100 Wall Street 50 Health and Life Sciences 50 Top 50 Power Women Top 100 Stars of the South Blog Events Travel Gift Shop Dan Keegan: Thriving as a Leader in Changing Times Daniel Keegan is Citigroup's co-head of Global Equities and the 2016 Irish America Wall Street 50 Keynote Speaker. (Photo: Kit DeFever) By Adam Farley, Deputy Editor October / November 2016 As Wall Street remaps its understanding of the markets, Daniel Keegan, co-head of Global Equities at Citigroup, is leading the way, shepherding his company through wholly novel and unprecedented conditions. ℘℘℘ One of the most influential leaders on Wall Street, Dan Keegan is a third-generation Irish American with roots in west County Meath and Cork on his father’s side, and just outside of Dublin on his mother’s. He is a devout Catholic, a proud member of a large Irish American family, and a life-long supporter of Notre Dame. Keegan’s father is an alumnus, so too his three brothers, and when the time came for Dan to go to college, his father told him he could go anywhere, but if he wanted it paid for, he should pack his bags for South Bend. He earned his B.A. in American studies, with concentrations in English, history, and government. Robert Schmuhl, professor of American studies and journalism, taught Keegan as an undergraduate and the two have remained close. He remembers his student’s combination of humor and inquisitiveness. “Curious, smart, personable, he made a winning impression then, and he continues to do so,” he told Irish America. “Laughter is never far away when he’s around, and each day his Irish good humor adds to the gaiety of this nation and others.” Keegan thinks of the markets like a puzzle “that I may never solve, but love working on nonetheless.” (Photo: Kit DeFever) Though Keegan has an abiding interest in history, when he graduated in 1991, he decided to study law, and where better than Notre Dame Law School, the oldest Roman Catholic law school in the nation. His father, a lawyer himself, wasn’t overly enthused at his decision. His advice to Dan was “don’t take notes.” Asked why, his father, he says, told him bluntly, “Others will take better notes, what you really need to learn is how to think.” To this day, Keegan, now 47, says it was the best advice he ever received (even if he didn’t feel that way at the time). “The idea of thinking about how to think, make arguments and defend one’s position is invaluable,” he says. “You can’t make an argument without understanding the other side and, by definition, understanding the other side implies that you’re listening and are committed to understanding every aspect of the debate.” After graduating, Keegan worked with his father’s law firm where he gained experience in general legal matters on a variety of topics ranging from personal injury law to family law, but after a year he decided to move on and try something different. Keegan grew up in Rumson, New Jersey, on the Shore, the middle of five children, and graduated high school in 1987. As a kid, he liked puzzles and was fascinated by his father’s Wall Street friends and their work: “I had always been interested in the markets and how they worked. And, so as not to be disingenuous, I admit it took me a long time to really understand them. It was not native, so I found it akin to a puzzle, to a degree, one that I may never solve, but love working on nonetheless.” Having been in the industry for 20 years now, Keegan still maintains that analogy to today’s markets. Still, too, his passion is unflinching, and he attributes much of his success to that puzzle-solving drive and hard work: first at Salomon Brothers in 1996 as a research sales assistant in Chicago, then with JPMorgan in San Francisco during the dot com boom, then back to Chicago in 2000, and back again to San Francisco in 2001 after the bubble burst. In 2002, JPMorgan asked him to move to New York to start a business for them in electronic trading. He later moved to Automated Trading Desk, which was acquired by Citi in 2007. He has been there ever since and has “the scar tissue to prove it,” he jokes, having weathered the 2008 financial crisis, the 2010 flash crash (during which the Dow dropped almost 1,000 points in just over half an hour), and countless other minor crises. Dan’s parents, Diane and John. (Courtesy Dan Keegan) He is analytical and not prone to hyperbole, so when he says today’s markets are unique in historical terms, you believe him: “It’s a fascinating time as global central bank coordination has pushed rates and volatility to unprecedented levels, all the while forcing investors out on the risk curve.” Because of that, no two days on the street are the same, he says, “and just when you think that you’ve got it figured out, the market serves up a big old piece of humble pie. Rest assured, I have had my fair share of said pie over the years.” That humility and an early passion for sports has left him with some natural leadership qualities including team building and making decisions under pressure that have helped his career. For him, it is now more about analyzing the game and its ancillary aspects to the simple dichotomy of winning or losing: “I love sports not just for the sport itself but for all the other things that come with it – competition, confidence, failure, the need for resiliency, and, of course, teamwork.” Basketball was his early passion, but, in his own words, “a slow first step and shaky jump shot” led to an abrupt end to his career on the court. Nonetheless, his passion for sports continues unabated. These days, Keegan, who bears a striking resemblance to Brian Kelly, Notre Dame’s legendary football coach, has switched his focus to golf, and he loves to golf in Ireland. His favorite place to play is Ballybunion Golf Club, in County Kerry. One of the most beautiful courses in the world with spectacular views of the ocean and grassy dunes, the old links course is also one of the most challenging. And Keegan loves a challenge, be it on the golf course or on Wall Street. “It is a very special feeling when you can bring a team together and that team collectively can accomplish something its members may have initially thought unachievable.” Keegan, second from right, golfing with friends in Ireland. (Courtesy Dan Keegan) Citigroup is one of the world’s largest financial conglomerates and the global equities division that Keegan oversees with his co-head, Murray Roos, is a huge part of the business with 1,000 employees. The market never sleeps, and this means that Keegan’s days are long, too. He is up at 5:30 a.m. and in the office by 6:30 if he’s not at a breakfast or traveling. At nights, after family time, he works until about midnight. He doesn’t mind it though. According to him, “very rarely does it feel like work.” Keegan met his wife, Elizabeth, at Notre Dame, where they dated in their senior year. They reunited in the late ’90s, married in 2000, and now have four children – a son, Danny (15), and three daughters, Rosemary (“Roey,” 13), Margaret (“Meg,” 11), and Katherine (10). It is clear in listening to him that his wife and kids take precedence over all else, a vestige of how he remembers his own upbringing (and parents in particular). “As frustrating as I probably was to my parents, and as strict as I might have perceived them to be in certain instances, they never quit. They never gave up on me,” he says. “I think that is the most important thing in parenting. While they never hesitated in holding me accountable for the mistakes I made, they never turned away from me either; everything was perceived as a teaching moment.” Keegan with his wife Elizabeth and their children, from left, Katherine, Roey, Meg, and Danny. (Photo: Ebert Studio / Courtesy Dan Keegan) But when it comes to kids and parenting, there’s always time for fun, especially if there’s a history or life-lesson involved. Fitting for a man involved in the cash business, Keegan loves Hamilton, the biographical musical about Alexander Hamilton, father of the national banking system and founder of the First Bank of the United States. He has been to see the show several times and it’s also a big hit with his kids. It’s important to him that his children are exposed to the arts and different cultures, and he recently took the family on a trip to China, which he says was not only educational, but also character-building. He has also taken them to Ireland. For his father’s 65th birthday in 2000, Keegan and his siblings surprised him by joining the celebration in Ireland. It was Dan’s first time in the country and he loved it. Since, he has gone back several times to play golf with friends. Most recently, he took his family to Dublin in 2012 for the Notre Dame v. Navy football game. It was his children’s first time in Ireland, and his third child, Meg, looking around, turned to Keegan and said, “Dad, I can see why this is where you’re from!” Keegan, who couldn’t pretend to be anything but Irish, was incredulous and almost offended, knowing his Hibernian features all too well. “What does that mean?” “No, I mean everyone’s the same!” True to form, Keegan, convinced no offense was intended, acquiesced and laughed. “You’re right. We all kind of look the same.” However true it may be with respect to Irish looks, it’s anything but on the trading floor, where Keegan distinguishes himself through measured consideration of issues, decisive execution, and, of course, his Irish good humor. The following is edited for clarity and length. Daniel Keegan. (Photo: Kit DeFever) What is your assessment of the current financial climate? In many ways, we find ourselves in unchartered territory. Quantitative easing around the world has created distortion in financial assets. The equity markets, for example, are approaching all time highs as ultra low rates have forced investors out on the risk curve. While investors remain relatively sanguine about the current set-up, it won’t take much in terms of a change in investor sentiment to introduce a far more volatile environment. What does that mean for you in this role? The macro environment is challenging, which, when coupled with some of the cyclical and secular challenges specific to our business, makes for a difficult operating environment. That being said, our business is focused around clients, namely understanding their needs, anticipating what comes next, and ensuring that we are delivering per their want. As a firm, we are quite unique in our global footprint, increasingly a competitive advantage as service provider capacity comes out of the system. Coupled with a commitment from senior management to invest back against the business, I feel very optimistic about what we can achieve on behalf of our clients over the next several years. How do you and your co-head break up the responsibilities? The co-head structure is new to me but something that I have taken to very quickly. My co-head Murray Roos is a great guy and very talented to boot. Other than the fact that he is younger, better looking and smarter (maybe!), we operate as equals. Having a partner to discuss ideas and challenge assumptions with is very valuable. In terms of the structure itself, we came to the conclusion early on that if this was to work, both of us needed to sign up to do the entire job. As such, we are each jointly and severably liable for the globe and every aspect of the business. Communication, as such, needs to be seamless, something that we focus on everyday. What is your decision-making process? While deliberate in thought, I tend to be decisive when it is time to act and I try to never look back. Exercising sound judgment is a key aspect of the job and many of the decisions made revolve around people where the human element is often on full display. As such, people decisions in particular require an elevated level of transparency such that the entire team understands the core thought process around it, with the want being to move forward. Sometimes no decision is a decision, but when it is time to make a decision, you have to make it. Now, in the context of a co-head structure, there is no decision I make in isolation, but once it’s made there is no looking back. Finally, in the context of decision-making, you can’t be afraid to make mistakes; it is an inevitability, everybody makes mistakes. The key is, once mistakes are identified, to rectify them as promptly as possible. What is your mentorship philosophy towards your employees? The assets in our business go up and down the elevator everyday. Accordingly, investing in our people is of paramount importance. Citi, in particular, I think is very strong in this regard, providing an array of development opportunities that zero in on product knowledge, leadership seminars, on-line training and the like. Moreover, within the business, we provide mentors for new employees that persist long beyond the first few years. Culture too plays a critical role. Creating an environment where people feel comfortable asking questions and/or challenging the norm is an equally important part of developing our people. The more you can get people to engage, the more we can learn from each other while advancing both the individual and the business along the way. How do you build the team in order to maintain that culture? I play a very active role in both recruiting and hiring. I want naturally inquisitive people. I want people who are not afraid to take risks. I want people who hold themselves more accountable than they would otherwise be held and I want people who genuinely want to be around other people and believe more in the value of the team than they do in themselves. On the flip-side, what I don’t want are people who read their own press clippings or who think themselves better than somebody else, whether it be their peer, the bathroom attendant, or the security guard at the front desk. We all work for the same firm. We all have jobs to do. Treating everyone with respect and appreciating the role that they play is a major part of building a winning culture. It does not mean that we don’t hold everyone accountable; we do. But the manner in which you do it matters. How has the industry changed post-crash? The financial crisis was painful in many, many ways and as an industry, we have to be honest with ourselves in terms of the role that we played. Nonetheless, if there is a silver lining to be found, it lies in a heightened awareness of the responsibility that we have to our clients and the broader public at large. Every morning when I arrive, our mission statement is prominently displayed on my desktop (no different than any other employee) and what it speaks to is responsible finance, the need to think first and foremost about our clients, and the obligations that we have to them and each other. You can automate a lot of things away, but you can never automate the way that relationship works. The relationship is ultimately the thing upon which trust is formed and trust, in this industry, is everything. The ultimate litmus test for me centers on my kids ­– whether I would feel comfortable introducing them into the industry. As it stands today, that answer is unequivocally yes. For all of the pain caused, I am proud to tell people what I do for a living and the value we are delivering to society at large. What would you like to see more of in the industry? The industry has changed a great deal post the crisis and I would like to see us promote those changes while speaking more to the role we play in society and the opportunities a career in our industry can provide – the role you can play in helping others. Citi does so much good for cities, towns and municipalities. It is very charitable organization and, in serving clients, plays a prominent role in how our society functions. Should we do more? Yes. Can we do more? Yes. Should we hold ourselves responsible for doing more? Absolutely. But I would like to see us trying to promote the benefits of what comes from having a career in financial services, the impact you can have – whether it is a broker servicing a widow or an institutional salesperson servicing a pension fund that manages money for teachers and unions, whether it is an investment banker servicing a corporate client who is trying to restructure a business that has failed, or whether it is the consumer bank where you are helping consumers around debt forgiveness. We need to make sure we are promoting that specifically in the context of the industry, so that people outside of it know the real value Wall Street creates. Tell me about Notre Dame. What is your relationship with the school like today? Notre Dame is a special place. It is a Catholic University that is recognized the world over for leading the discussion on a range of society’s most pressing issues. The faculty and administration are second to none, the facilities are amazing and the student population is quite unique. Yet Notre Dame is more than that. Notre Dame is a place where all students are challenged to look beyond themselves, to question their place in society and how they can give back. Having spent seven years at Notre Dame, with the good fortune too of having met my wife while there, Notre Dame will forever carry a special place in my heart. How important was your Catholicism to your upbringing? I am very proud to say that I am a Catholic. I went to Catholic grammar school, high school, college, and law school, so religion has always been a big part of my life and shaped my belief system in many ways. For me, it provides perspective and has taught me to focus less on myself and made me more focused on others. At Notre Dame, every dorm has a chapel in it, so irrespective of whether you are Catholic or not, the sense of being part of something that is bigger than you – which is what I think religion speaks to – is very, very powerful and should drive how it is we live our lives. Do you think there is anything you have particularly inherited from your parents? My parents are great. They have taught me much of what I now know. Leading by example, they both work very hard, yet never take themselves too seriously. They are not afraid to laugh at themselves, but never will they laugh at others. They are both exceedingly good people who have provided me great role models to emulate along the way. From a heritage perspective, they taught me how much our ancestors suffered to give us the opportunities that we now have, for the courage of their conviction to make the move. They worked super hard and as a result of that we had a really nice upbringing. That work ethic and making sure that you don’t take shortcuts is something that stuck with me. How do you interact with your own children about their connection to Ireland and their Irish American ancestry? Well, we took them there. You can tell all the stories you want, but there is no substitute for seeing it first hand, learning the history, and coming to appreciate the sacrifices those before you made in giving the opportunities they now have. In particular, touring a replica of the type of ship that transported their ancestors was eye-opening. Ireland has such a rich history, and its unique relationship with America will provide them continued opportunity to understand their heritage in the context of who they are and from where they came. As is the beauty of youth, they are only getting started. How do you address the work-life balance? Life is all about making choices, but striking the “right” balance between work and everything else is not easy. Prioritizing what is most important in your life and managing your time efficiently are key determinants in striking the right balance. I love the people with whom I work; I believe in the firm. So, in and of itself, that provides me a great pleasure, but nothing trumps the pleasure that I get from being with my family. For now, just about everything else needs to take a backseat. What is the most important value for you to teach your children and how do you do it? Like all parents, we want our kids to work hard, have fun, take chances, and not be afraid to fail. Most importantly, we want them to treat everyone the way they would like to be treated. Admittedly that is easier said than done, and the mistakes that they make are often very much on display, requiring a more immediate response or analysis of where they have fallen short. The world in which they are growing up in is quite different from the one I knew as a child. The external pressures that they feel are quite pronounced, the stakes seemingly greater. Accordingly, we try to engage our kids in a dialogue, in some ways to act as an outlet for them to share their challenges. Does it work? Only sometimes, but ensuring that they know there is somewhere to go with their problems is important. In terms of rules, there are many and the consequences for breaking them are swift. However, taking responsibility for their mistakes is critical. Just as they fail, so do we as parents, but so long as we all understand that and try everyday to get better and learn from our mistakes, we are moving in the right direction. Thank you. ♦   One Response to “Dan Keegan: Thriving as a Leader in Changing Times” Peter garland says: October 19, 2016 at 10:05 pm Geez, did he really deserve this much space? It’s boring.

Gatti’s previous subjects include JP Morgan Chase and Silvio Berlusconi—targets more deserving of his skills. The article was rolled out in multiple languages simultaneously, like the NSA leak: “in English by NYR Daily, in Italian by Il Sole 24 Ore, in German by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, and in French on the investigative website, Mediapart,” as the footnote read. Reporting on the reaction to Gatti’s story, the New York Times reached Ferrante’s publisher, Sandra Ozzola Ferri, for comment. “If someone wants to be left alone, leave her alone,” she said. “She’s not a member of the Camorra, or Berlusconi. She’s a writer and isn’t doing anyone any harm.” Ferrante’s readers were quick to denounce Gatti’s revelation. I myself was irritated. Even the stones know that Ferrante is Ferrante, and that’s the way her readers want it. More than Ferrante herself, her readers have benefited from her choice, spared so much extradiegetic noise. We are as invested in her anonymity—and her autonomy—as she is. It is a compact: she won’t tell us, we won’t ask, and she won’t change her mind and tell us anyway. In exchange, she’ll write books and we’ll read them. The feminist defense of Ferrante’s privacy was especially swift. It’s difficult to read a man’s attempt to “out” a writer who has said she would stop writing if she were ever identified as anything but an attempt to make her stop writing. ...“I believe that, today, failing to protect writing by guaranteeing it an autonomous space, far from the demands of the media and the marketplace, is a mistake,” Ferrante told the Financial Times last year. This is an uncontroversial truth. Writers need space to work. One word for this space is room; another is freedom; another is privacy. Each writer finds this space where she can. Woolf pragmatically emphasized the material: “give her a room of her own and five hundred a year, let her speak her mind and leave out half that she now puts in, and she will write a better book one of these days.” (She needed the metaphysical, too: “I need solitude,” Woolf wrote in her diaries. “I need space. I need air. I need the empty fields around me; and my legs pounding along roads; and sleep; and animal existence.”) Kafka found his space at night: “The burning electric light, the silent house, the darkness outside, the last waking moments, they give me the right to write even if it be only the most miserable stuff. And this right I use hurriedly. That’s the person I am.” When she was young, Dorothy West asked her mother for permission to close her door so she could think, and to lock it so she could write. “ ore here.

Right at the start to the week, traders will watch Sunday night's presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This second debate between the two candidates is scheduled for 9 p.m., ET, at Washington University in St. Louis and will take the form of a town meeting. "I don't believe a Clinton win is completely priced into the markets," said Brian Muench, vice president of investment management at Allianz Investment Management. He expects a pullback in stocks by the end of the year, and polls showing a tighter race between the two candidates could contribute to the decline. The potential number of market-moving events only heats up as the week progresses. Earnings season unofficially kicks off Tuesday with Alcoa (AA)'s quarterly results, and the meeting minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's September meeting are due Wednesday. New York Fed President Bill Dudley is also scheduled to speak that day. The climax comes Friday with earnings from major banks Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC). "For me, the real driver for markets the end of this year should really be third-quarter earnings," said Chris Wright, ultra high net worth investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management. "We'd be looking for quite strong earnings growth in the third quarter given we've got a fairly benign third quarter." Retail sales are due for release on the same day, and Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak that afternoon on "Macroeconomic research after the crisis." "We'll be watching consumer data next week just to confirm we think the consumer is in a good position here," said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "Earnings and the retail sales and any Fed speakers will be closely watched as to how they digest (Friday's jobs) release," he said. The September nonfarm payrolls report showed creation of 156,000 for the month, below expectations, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 5 percent. Average hourly wages rose 6 cents to an annualized rate of 2.6 percent. U.S. stocks closed slightly lower Friday after the jobs report and snapped a three-week win streak. The S&P 500 ended the week at 2,153.74, weighed by a 5.3 percent decline in the REITs sector. "While we're still two jobs reports away from the Fed meeting, there probably could have been some political implications for this," said David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Global Asset Management. But the data "wasn't strong enough to crow about if you're a Democrat, and it wasn't weak enough to bad mouth if you're a Republican. It won't have a lot of effect on Fed expectations." The data reduced already low expectations for a November rate hike and added to general expectations the Fed will raise rates in December. The U.S. dollar index rose 1.1 percent for the week amid increased anticipation of a rate hike later this year and the plunge in the pound. Gold futures for December delivery fell nearly 5 percent for its worst week in three years and settled Friday at $1,251.90 an ounce. Treasury yields were lower after the jobs report, with the U.S. two-year Treasury note yield (US2Y) around 0.83 percent and the 10-year yield (US10Y) near 1.72 percent. Bond markets are closed Monday for Columbus Day. "Yields have spent the month of October moving upward [on] fears of payrolls, the Fed, the European Central Bank," said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist, Prudential Fixed Income. "One by one, the various concerns are getting aired." U.S. crude oil futures will also be in focus next week on whether oil can hold recent gains. Crude topped the psychologically key $50 level this week before ending the week at $49.81 a barrel after Baker Hughes data showed U.S. drillers added rigs in 14 of the past 15 weeks. Meanwhile, investors will keep a close eye for news on a settlement between Deutsche Bank and the U.S. Department of Justice. Traders will also watch British pound sterling after it plunged to fresh 31-year lows against the U.S. dollar. The decline came amid comments from European leaders that indicated a stricter than anticipated break between the U.K. and the European Union would come with an official trigger of Brexit.

Sterling sank 6.1 percent in a span of minutes in early Asian trading Oct. 7, following at least three other bouts of puzzling foreign-exchange turbulence in the past two years. The latest episode involved the fourth-most-traded currency, serving up a stark reminder of the pitfalls that investors face in the world’s biggest financial market as banks -- the traditional middlemen -- step back amid post-crisis regulations.  The currency market is growing more fragile because “phantom liquidity” is undermining investors’ ability to buy and sell when they need to, Bank of America analysts wrote in an Oct. 5 note. Their research found that with trading volumes in decline, transactions have a 60 percent greater impact on prices than just two years ago. The size of last week’s move “in the deepest and biggest market in the world scares the hell out of everyone,” said Bob Savage, chief executive officer of hedge fund CCTrack Solutions LLC in New York. “The larger story is whether there’s anything to do about it.” Stepping Back The lifeblood of the global economy, the currency market has been blighted by staff reductions and a rate-fixing scandal that’s ensnared some of the world’s biggest banks. Stricter regulation enacted since the financial crisis has prompted dealers to step back, opening the door for automated market makers to expand, though the new entrants haven’t stemmed a drop in volumes. Daily trading in global currencies has shrunk almost 6 percent since 2013, Bank for International Settlements data show. The pound’s so-called flash crash follows a similar event for South Africa’s rand, which in January tumbled 9 percent in 15 minutes, before rebounding. New Zealand’s dollar had its own flash crash in August last year. “If investors have an urgency to transact, the liquidity that they see might disappear and they might not be able to do so,” said Vadim Iaralov, a foreign-exchange strategist in New York at Bank of America, the world’s fifth-largest currency trader according to Euromoney magazine. “There may be nobody on the other side of the trade.” Shock events may trigger unexpected volatility and cause bid-ask spreads to widen significantly as market makers withdraw during turbulent periods to avoid losses, Iaralov and co-author Christopher Xiao wrote in last week’s note. Liquidity’s Cost For strategists at JPMorgan Chase & Co., the second-biggest currency trader, the pound’s plunge breathes new life into the debate about the market’s changing structure and its impact on liquidity. In a sign of the growing competition from non-banks, computerized trading firm XTX Markets Ltd. placed ninth in Euromoney’s ranking of foreign-exchange traders, released in May. High-speed market makers have more than tripled currency volumes in the last three years, according to Aite Group, a consultant in Boston. “The advent of non-bank liquidity providers such as HFTs has reduced bid ask spread and increased market efficiency in FX markets, but at the cost of lower market depth and withdrawal of liquidity provision in periods of stress,” JPMorgan strategists including Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in an Oct. 7 note. 2016 Laggard The pound has already fueled plenty of handwringing. At about $1.24 as of 12:30 p.m. in New York Monday, it’s down almost 16 percent against the dollar this year, making sterling the worst performer among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It plunged to the lowest in more than three decades last week on speculation the U.K. economy will weaken in the aftermath of Britons’ June vote to exit the European Union. Sterling is the world’s fourth-most actively traded currency, after the dollar, euro and yen, according to the BIS. The Bank of England is looking into the reasons behind sterling’s plunge, and Governor Mark Carney has asked the BIS to review the incident. The pound’s dive underscores the challenge of overseeing a market that’s mostly over-the-counter, spans the globe and doesn’t fit neatly under the authority of any single regulator. In U.S. Treasuries trading, an episode of unusual volatility two years ago prompted the government’s first review of the market since 1998. On Oct. 15, 2014, yields on the 10-year note plunged 0.16 percentage point and then rebounded in just 12 minutes. Click here to read more on the government’s review of the Treasuries market. The growing role of automated and algorithmic trading makes this sort of turbulence more likely, said Thomas Suter, chief executive officer at QCAM Currency Asset Management AG, a Switzerland-based hedge fund that runs a $600 million foreign-exchange options program wagering on volatility. “If such incidents take place regularly, this is very negative for trust in the financial markets,” he said.

There are more signs every week that tech's IPO activity could finally pick up again, and the news couldn't come soon enough for investment bankers. "From an equity capital markets perspective, it's been a tough year," Frank Maturo, UBS' vice chairman for equity capital markets in the Americas, said in June. In fact, 2016 has been the worst year for initial public offerings since the height of the financial crisis. There were only 73 IPOs in the first three quarters of the year, according to FactSet. That's down 45% from last year and the lowest total since 2009. The tech space was even less active, with only a handful of small companies having gone public so far this year. JPMorgan, the top bank for equity capital markets revenue in the first nine months of the year, has earned $779 million in revenue, compared with $1.05 billion in the same period last year. Morgan Stanley, in second place, has earned only $590 million, down from $997 million last year. In August, Gadfly's Shira Ovide described it as a clog. Now it looks as if the unclogging is about to begin, as all signs point to a much busier market in 2017 and 2018. For one thing, the pace of IPOs has increased as the year has progressed. While the first quarter of 2016 was particularly devoid of IPOs, with just nine deals, the number of flotations in the third quarter was 16.7% higher than last year, according to FactSet. Within tech, the deals that have gone public this year have all been successful. Twilio, the phone and text-message services company that went public in June, is trading up 304% from its $15 IPO price. Line, the Japanese mobile-messaging app that hit the markets in July, is up 45% from its initial $32.84 offer price. Nutanix, the virtualization-software company that started trading on September 30, is up 138% from its $16 initial price. Coupa, the cloud-software company that hit the markets on Thursday, is already trading up 65% from its IPO price of $18. "I can't think of one IPO that's trading down," one banker told Business Insider. And it's not just the small deals that are starting to roll in. Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, is working on an IPO, which could take place as early as March, a deal that could value the photo-sharing company at as much as $25 billion. "Snapchat's probably in a position more than other unicorns to address the market sooner rather than later if they want to," the banker told Business Insider, adding that some larger "unicorn" companies could be looking to go public in the first part of 2017, rather than in the middle of the year "with the rest of the pack." View photos evan spiegelMore (Snap Inc. CEO Evan Spiegel.AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) Of course banks will be scrambling to get in on the action with Snap, which hasn't yet picked underwriters. A separate banker told Business Insider that they expect Snap to choose banks by December. But Snapchat isn't the only hotly awaited IPO. Okta, the secure-identity-management company, is widely seen as a likely candidate. So are the accounting-software company BlackLine and the performance-Wi-Fi company Quantenna Communications. As for the larger unicorns, Spotify, Palantir, and Dropbox are other potential contenders, one banker said, while Airbnb and Uber are more likely to go in 2018. At the end of the third quarter, the six-month pipeline consisted of 30 potential issuers across industries that could raise a combined $5.1 billion in proceeds, according to data from Ipreo. Here are the top bookrunners that could win big from that backlog. Screen Shot 2016 10 07 at 5.14.48 PMMore (Ipreo) One thing to bear in mind: There has been a pickup in the number of potential IPOs that end up turning into mergers-and-acquisitions transactions this year. That's especially the case among sponsor-backed deals. The security-software company Blue Coat Systems, for example, made its IPO filing public in early June and then days later sold to Symantec. Performance Health, which sold to Patterson Medical in May, was also expected to go public before its takeover, as was TransFirst, which was instead acquired by TSYS in January. Read More That companies are running "dual-track processes" — that is, both running a sales process while preparing for an IPO — is not new. But the sponsors backing these companies appear to be leaning more toward sales right now, given the uncertainty around things like the upcoming US presidential election, the Federal Reserve's decisions about interest-rate moves, and the state of the global economy. View photos Frank Maturo, UBSMore (Frank Maturo, UBS' vice chairman for equity capital markets.REUTERS/Brendan McDermid) That trend could hold up, even with larger companies that aren't sponsor-backed. One of the bankers said that even the unicorn companies on deck could be putting the feelers out to gauge for interest from potential acquirers. "Some are probably trying to put the word out there that they may go public to fish for an M&A bid," the person said. But any pickup in activity would be welcome to bankers. "IPOs are down so much, and block trades and overnight deals are up so much," Maturo said in June. "That makes it a very tough environment for ECM people or origination people that are going out trying to win business."

The sovereign received more than $6 billion (Dh22 billion) in orders last week as it printed $1 billion of seven-year sukuk — its first deal in that market in five years — and a $1 billion 12-year conventional bond. “It had good timing as there is demand for higher-yielding names, and the Middle East is the right region, particularly with commodity prices recovering,” said Zsolt Papp, a client portfolio manager at JP Morgan Asset Management. “It pretty much ticked all of the boxes.” The 12-year conventional tranche was initially marketed at the 7.25 per cent area, or about 570bp over mid-swaps. For comparison, Bahrain’s January 2026s were at 487bp over mid-swaps, according to Thomson Reuters. Pricing was revised to 7.125 per cent, before launching at 7 per cent. A banker close to the deal saw a new-issue premium on the notes at 15bp-20bp. “We saw more value in the conventional 12-year, which came slightly cheaper,” said Max Wolman, portfolio manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. Illiquid Finding fair value for the sukuk was more difficult because of the illiquidity of Bahrain’s sukuk curve. The sukuk began marketing at 6 per cent area. Guidance was set at 5.75 per cent-5.875 per cent, with the notes being priced at 5.625 per cent, or 424bp over mid-swaps. The banker on the deal saw the new-issue concession on the sukuk as anything up to 10bp. The concession was enough to attract demand, despite testing the duration appetite of domestic investors. “We had some pushback on the ratings and tenor on that one, but we had a big enough book to tighten pricing considerably,” said a second lead banker. Concerns Bahrain printed the deal it wanted despite wider concerns about its credit quality. “Bahrain is not a great credit,” said Wolman. “But it’s getting enough support from the GCC that you don’t need to worry about it too much. It’s the highest paying of the sovereigns out there, so why not buy it?” Earlier this month Oman, which is equally vulnerable to commodity prices, printed a tap of its 10-year notes at 4.708 per cent. While Oman is investment-grade rated at Baa1/BBB-, and its bonds are index-eligible, unlike Bahrain, the latter’s new 12-year notes are still offering a considerable pickup. Bahrain’s current account fell into a $79 million deficit last year. Foreign reserves have more than halved since the end of 2014, dropping well below the import cover level considered a country’s comfort zone. However, Bahrain benefits from a regional development fund. The bond prospectus also revealed that Bahrain receives “significantly more” than its 50 per cent entitlement under the Abu Saafa oilfield treaty with Saudi Arabia. The sovereign had sought to get into the market before its bigger neighbour Saudi Arabia arrives with its jumbo debut. The strategy paid off, with both bonds trading up on the break. “The issuer is very responsible,” said the second lead banker. “They know they shouldn’t squeeze every penny out of investors.” Bahrain is rated BB stable/BB+ stable (S&P, Fitch). The 144A/Reg S transaction was run by Bank ABC, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan and Standard Chartered.

On the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, yields on Extell’s bonds had soared to 16 percent, effectively turning them into junk bonds, and Barnett’s Israeli investors were spooked by Manhattan’s struggling high-end condo market. Of particular concern to Extell’s backers were two of the company’s most ambitious new developments, One Manhattan Square (1MS) on the Lower East Side and Central Park Tower (CPT) on Billionaires’ Row. Barnett was seeking over $2 billion in debt and equity for the two projects, a lofty goal with condo prices slipping and banks wary of financing new luxury developments. And even if he could find the money to build his glitzy towers, where would the buyers come from? Barnett flew to Tel Aviv in an attempt to calm his investors’ nerves. But according to multiple sources, he did a lousy job of it. “He just put more fuel to the fire,” said Shahar Keinan of Brosh Capital, an Israeli hedge fund that deals in distressed corporate bonds and jumped in to buy some of Extell’s. “He didn’t say, ‘Everything is going to be okay, don’t worry.’ He said, ‘There are risks, I can’t guarantee anything.’” “Sometimes, it’s not the message, it’s how you wrap it and say it to the bondholders,” said one source familiar with the Israeli bond market. What Barnett said “was the last thing that investors wanted to hear.” In an interview with The Real Deal this September, Barnett took issue with that characterization: “I was not pessimistic, I was cautionary,” he said. “I wanted to let people know what the risks were.” Six months after that trip, however, Barnett seems far more optimistic — and it’s easy to see why. Since August, he’s locked down more than $1 billion in financing for the two projects. For 1MS, he scored a $300 million mezzanine loan from Scott Rechler’s RXR Realty and a $500 million construction loan from a consortium led by Deutsche Bank and Natixis. For CPT, commonly referred to as the Nordstrom Tower for the department store that will anchor it, he scored approximately $300 million in equity from SMI USA, the U.S. subsidiary of Shanghai’s largest state-owned enterprise. On his return to Israel in September, Barnett “talked a different tune,” Keinan said. “He thinks the situation has improved dramatically. He thinks he will gain back the trust here in Israel.” Yields on Extell’s bonds have improved to the mid-10 percent range since March. Pulling rabbits out of hats is nothing new for Barnett. He had the chutzpah to build the ultra-luxury One57 in the thick of the downturn, and wrested control of a valuable Midtown South office portfolio that rivals had given up for dead. “He was building One57 right in the teeth of the 2008 Lehman collapse,” said Donna Olshan of Olshan Realty. “If there’s money in the world, he knows how to find it.” This time around though, his task is even tougher: There’s a nearly $200 million financing gap at 1MS and a $900 million construction loan to source for CPT, which would be one of the largest issued to a New York developer this cycle. And he’s got to find the funds at a time when lenders are shutting up shop. In addition, the SMI deal has come under scrutiny by investors wary of the harsh conditions it imposes on Extell: if Barnett can’t meet SMI’s financing deadlines, the Chinese behemoth wants its money back. Barnett’s playing a high-stakes game of real estate Tetris, and to win he’ll need not only to source capital, but to shift it into the right places at just the right times. As a poster child for savvy investments and calculated long-term assemblages, there’s a belief among industry insiders that his successes — or failures — will set the tone for the market in the months to come. “Gary’s an entrepreneur, but like a crazy one,” Keinan said. “Everyone told us, ‘If there is someone who can pull it off, it will be Gary.’ But even for him, it’s a stretch.” Smizing A rendering of Central Park Tower (Credit: New York YIMBY) Extell completed its first offering on the Israeli bond market in 2014, eventually raising a total of $400 million at roughly 6 percent, much cheaper than could be found at home. One headache that came with the cheap debt, however, was the level of transparency that the mandatory public disclosures have imposed on Extell — scrutiny that some developers find disconcerting. “Gary’s an entrepreneur, but like a crazy one.” — Shahar Keinan, Brosh Capital “I decided not to do it for that very reason,” Rechler said. “You’re trying to sell units. With that kind of transparency, you can’t control the messaging.” “It’s not ideal,” Barnett agreed. “But it comes with the territory. I took the money. Now, I have to pay for it.” The disclosures provide rare insight into how Extell is trying to put together the funds to finish CPT, which many in the market have speculated will not get built. The 1,500-foot-high condo project at 217 West 57th Street is set to eclipse 432 Park Avenue as the tallest residential building in New York and will have a sellout of over $4 billion. But Barnett needs over $2 billion just to build it, and said the total capitalization of the project tops $3 billion. Here’s the math: Barnett’s equity, plus an approximately $300 million capital injection from SMI and an infusion of cash from Nordstrom (which is buying its space), amounts to more than $800 million lined up for the project so far, Barnett confirmed. That leaves the developer with approximately $1.2 billion to go, $300 million or more of which may come from money raised through the EB-5 investment visa program. Barnett has tapped the program for cash several times in the past, including for 1MS. Yaniv Saylan, an analyst at Israel Brokerage & Investments, said that as a “bondholder,” he had “uncertainty and a lack of awareness” about how CPT will be built. “I’m worried about it,” Saylan added. “All you have to do is go by 57th Street and you’d see it was getting built,” Barnett countered. “There’s never been a slowdown.” Extell is in talks with several potential lenders for the $900 million construction loan — though Barnett declined to confirm any names, sources said the list includes JPMorgan Chase and the Korea Investment Corporation. But the developer is in a serious time crunch. It has just three months to repay a $235 million land loan from Blackstone Group, which it secured in 2013. To repay the loan, Barnett is counting on securing the construction loan rather than going through a refinancing. If he’s unable to repay Blackstone by the deadline, the loan goes into a one-year standstill agreement, whereby the private equity giant can’t demand an immediate settlement until the latter part of 2017. Barnett has already blown one deadline. If he blows the next one, the interest rate on the loan will shoot up from 8 percent to 14 percent. He isn’t bullish on racing the clock. “We have a deadline to meet and we’re going to try very hard to meet that deadline,” he said. “That’s our job. Beyond that, I’m not going to speculate.” And then there’s SMI. The subsidiary of Shanghai Municipal Investment, a developer of Shanghai’s tallest skyscraper, expects to make a return of up to 20 percent if the project goes as hoped, according to Barnett. SMI will be entitled to an annual interest of 4.5 percent in monthly payments, as well as 30 percent of the development fees, according to TASE filings, which also show that Extell needs to get SMI’s blessings for all critical decisions. But if Barnett can’t close on a construction loan by July, SMI has what amounts to a real estate get out of jail free card: It can force Barnett to buy back its equity stake for roughly $300 million, plus interest. And if he can’t come up with the funds to buy SMI out by July 2018, it can push him to sell the whole project. While few expect it to go that far, it’s a scary proposition for any developer. “It was kind of a distressed deal,” said one Israeli bond market source. “You have a lot of conditions. It’s an equity partner if everything goes smoothly, if not, it becomes sort of a mezz lender.” A chart showing the SMI deal (Credit: IBI) In an August report, IBI said CPT “represents the core risk to Extell’s business because of the challenges it will face in seeing this project through the completion. “These include the uncertainty over future funding sources, the relationship between the parties with an interest in the project (Blackstone, Nordstrom and SMI) and the softening of demand for residential property in New York.” Bankers said SMI’s demands illustrate how equity investors are getting serious about contingency plans, in case the market slides further. And there are signs that lenders are following suit. “Lenders are becoming more informed about the sponsor’s other projects and those deadlines,” Ori Eisenberg of real estate financial advisory firm One Ha’am said in September, when Extell closed on its construction loan for 1MS. “Terms are being customized.” Brad Dubeck, the commercial real estate banking executive for Bank of America in New York, said, “these days, the domestic banks are not keen on new ultra-luxury condo loans and many foreign lenders have lost their appetite as well. But this is a terrific piece of real estate. I’m confident Gary will secure financing. It might be more expensive than in the past and will likely come from a non-traditional provider.” Developers such as Macklowe Properties and CIM Group have turned to alternative lenders such as hedge funds to get their projects built. At 432 Park, for example, the word is that Macklowe and CIM are paying nearly 10 percent on their loan from Children’s Investment Fund. Others have gotten even more creative: Sharif El-Gamal, for example, turned to a consortium of international lenders to score $219 million in Sharia-compliant financing for 45 Park Place. “You have a lot of conditions. It’s an equity partner if everything goes smoothly, if not, it becomes sort of a mezz lender.” — Israeli bond market source Barnett believes he’s on solid footing. “It’s an extraordinarily low loan-to-value loan,” he said. “We’re going to be looking at less than $2,000 a foot [basis] for a construction loan and 220 [Vornado Realty Trust’s 220 Central Park South] is averaging [sale prices of] between $8,000 and $9,000 a foot.” But even he concedes that, for banks, perception matters. “Today, it’s not so much a question of loan-to-value as that condos are difficult to finance, period,” he said. “Not because they don’t make sense, but because, even if they’re guaranteed their money back, the banks just don’t want trouble. They don’t want to get a call from regulators saying they need to put more reserves forward, even if it’s not warranted. They know they can’t fight with Uncle Sam.” First we take Manhattan A rendering of One Manhattan Square Extell’s recent flurry of financing deals at 1MS convinced investors the project is now a go — even if not quite on the terms they expected. The firm was well underway with work by the time it scored the construction loan in September, thanks to Barnett’s own deep pockets. “Those pockets,” he quipped, “were starting to feel a bit empty.” One Ha’am’s Eisenberg said that after SMI secured a corporate guarantee on CPT, he’d heard that Deutsche Bank would also get one for the $500 million construction loan they are leading on 1MS. “This is unusual for a New York developer,” Eisenberg added, “but I don’t think it’s by chance.” The construction loan was also downsized from an original $600 million, but the lenders have the option to bump it up to $750 million within the first nine months, according to TASE filings. “It was a struggle,” Barnett admitted. “We thought we’d be able to get a higher loan per square foot price than we were able to achieve. We had to lower our sights by more than 10 percent and pay a little bit more.” “Even if they’re guaranteed their money back, the banks just don’t want trouble.” — Gary Barnett Extell was also counting on $463 million in mezzanine financing from RXR, but after Barnett didn’t score his construction loan in time — a condition of closing on the mezz loan — Rechler’s firm slashed its loan to $300 million and raised the interest from 7 to 8 percent. The loan is also collateralized by Extell’s condo project at 500 East 14th Street in the East Village and its rental tower nearing completion at 555 10th Avenue. Dubeck said developer-lenders such as RXR, who’ve filled a gap left by traditional banks, are typically able to negotiate better terms as they face little competition. “On one hand, it’s very positive to see an experienced and sophisticated player like RXR make investments in Gary’s projects at a more uncertain time in the market,” he said. “It shows support for the business plan for those assets. On the other hand, it might signal the lending appetite is cooling.” Barnett joked that Rechler “conned me,” promising cheap debt. “He’s a charming fellow, Scott,” Barnett added. “We went down the road and it turns out it wasn’t so low-cost. But, it’s probably a win-win situation. For us, it gave us that extra chunk of capital, which, given the financing environment, we needed.” With construction and mezzanine loans in place, Barnett now has about $850 million for the project, enough to finance about 18 months of construction, according to the developer. That amount includes an additional $55 million he secured last month from a Deutsche Bank-led consortium. Completing the project will require another $190 million. RXR is likely to exercise its option to increase its loan by $163 million, Rechler said, and Barnett will look to banks and EB-5 funds for the rest. “With doubts about whether construction would actually be completed having now been lifted, the only concern is how quickly the project will sell and the prices for properties,” the IBI report stated. The 815-unit project’s target sellout is about $1.88 billion, down from over $2 billion last year. Extell has already sold 60 units for a total of $125 million to both domestic and Asian buyers, according to Israeli bond market filings from Sept. 5 — and the sales office is opening this month. “Only a few deals were sold directly to China, but we have a lot of Asians buying because it is Chinatown,” Barnett said. “It’s really word of mouth though, because we [the sales office] are not open. The issue is logistics. There’s a lot of people interested but you have to be able to get deals done.” Spring cleaning Barnett’s continued need for cash has some of his investors wondering: What other sources of capital might he tap? Going back to the Israeli bond market doesn’t seem like an option, at least not now. “The market has learned to distinguish between Gary, who is a developer, and operators focused on income-producing assets,” said Yossi Levi of Infin, which advises U.S. developers on raising debt in Israel. “For condo developers, it will be very hard to raise money right now.” A possible source of funds, Israeli investors believe, is a sale or refinancing of Extell’s 555 10th Avenue. The 52-story, 478-unit luxury rental project will begin leasing in October and IBI forecasts its annual net operating income at $30 million. When RXR reduced its mezzanine loan for the three Extell projects, it also restructured the deal so that Extell has greater financial flexibility on 555 10th. Extell may now sell or refinance its stake, which is valued at between $300 million and $400 million, based on a total asset valuation of between $700 million and $800 million, Saylan said. Extell has already sold off other assets, including a site at 134 West 58th Street to Stanley Wasserman’s S.W. Management for $61.5 million and another at 12 West 48th Street to DNA Development for $37.2 million. It’s also looking to sell a site at 30-32 East 29th Street. “If the economics make sense to sell, I’ll sell,” Barnett said. “If it makes sense to keep long-term, I’ll keep it. I like owning New York real estate long-term — but not if it’s stupid.” But Barnett said he won’t necessarily move funds from these prospective sales into CPT. He has plenty of other projects, such as CityPoint in Brooklyn and a development site on East 86th Street, into which the money could go. “We have some small assemblages that we thought we’d be able to make bigger but couldn’t,” he said. “We’re doing a spring cleaning. We have a number of major projects in the pipeline and those just take up time and money that could be put to better use. It’s not huge money. We don’t see this as a source for financing.” Proposed changes to the EB-5 program, which is up for renewal, could complicate Barnett’s capital expectations. Some proposals would curtail the number of projects eligible to accept EB-5 money and would increase the minimum investment amount for EB-5 applicants from $500,000 to $800,000 for projects in high unemployment areas. In areas with low unemployment, the minimum threshold would jump from $1 million to $1.2 million, potentially putting a dent in investor demand. A far more damning provision would require existing investors to retroactively cough up the additional amounts. It is this change that could cause investors to pull their money out of U.S. real estate projects, leaving developers in the lurch. “If it goes through in its current form, it ends the EB-5 program,” said immigration attorney Mona Shah. That would hit Barnett particularly hard, as he’s looking to raise at least $400 million through EB-5 funds for 1MS and CPT, some of which has already come through. Barnett admitted the uncertainty surrounding EB-5 was a nuisance. But he believes the likelihood of the retroactive provision going through is slim. “It will definitely be restrictive but I don’t think Congress wants to hurt people for very little benefit,” he said. “Whatever legislation gets done, I think it’s likely that it will be done in a way that doesn’t damage the investors that have already put money in in good faith.” The price is right A view from inside One57 Barnett’s last great triumph, One57, could actually become an unlikely stumbling block in his fundraising quest for CPT and 1MS. The alpha dog of the last boom now has its tail firmly between its legs. Where units at the property were once devoured by wealthy investors looking for a quick upside, some of those buyers have suffered losses in recent months. For example, Escape from New York, an LLC that bought a pad at One57 for $32 million in 2014, recently went into contract to sell the unit for what’s likely to be at least a $7 million loss, given that the unit’s last asking price was $25 million. In March, Extell reduced the projected sellout at the building to $2.56 billion, $162 million lower than in 2013. Banks keeping tabs may be loath to lend on a project likely to be even more ostentatious. Many of Barnett’s rivals have decided to wait out the slowdown. JDS Development Group and Property Markets Group delayed sales at their skinny supertall at 111 West 57th Street, and Witkoff shelved plans to convert the Park Lane Hotel into luxury condos. Though Extell’s investors may not share Barnett’s optimism about the condo market, they take solace in the company’s seemingly stable net asset value portfolio. I like owning New York real estate long-term — but not if it’s stupid.” — Gary Barnett “If in the past Extell’s future hinged on the securing of funding (so much so that at times it looked as if the company would have no option but to suspend construction at all sites), this is not the case anymore and it will probably remain as such for at least another year,” IBI wrote in its report. In a bid to calculate Israeli bondholders’ level of security, Brosh Capital’s Keinan said his company tallied up all the assets in Extell’s public Israeli offering. “We calculated what he [Barnett] would get if he sells everything tomorrow,” Keinan said. “We did that for each and every one of his assets. After we did that, and deducted the bond loans, we still got a positive equity value. Even if he needs to sell everything tomorrow, he still has positive equity, guaranteeing the bondholders get their money back in full.” Barnett doesn’t dwell on the doom and gloom headlines. He prefers rosier stuff, like sales at Vornado’s 220 Central Park South, which he called “15 Central Park West on steroids” for its strong performance. (It’s worth noting, however, that after trumpeting sales at the tower every chance he got, Vornado’s CEO Steve Roth has stayed mum about them for about a year.) He also points to a more recent rebound at One57. While Extell sold no units there in the first two quarters of the year, deals were signed on four apartments for a total of $80 million in the six weeks ending Sept. 5. “There are still a lot of people who want to buy,” Barnett said of the luxury market. “It’s just a question of them thinking that the market is turning and the psychology is holding them back. But that only lasts for a while.” He’ll succeed, he believes, because he’s doing what some of his lesser rivals failed to: pricing projects on their merits. “A lot of it’s in tertiary locations,” he said of other new developments. “People bought and paid high prices for the land and now buyers look at it and think, ‘Hang on, why am I paying $8 million to go there?’ Then, there are people who are asking stupid prices and people who aren’t executing well. You didn’t know what you were doing, guy. You didn’t give the people what they want.” Correction: In an earlier version of this story, TRD incorrectly stated the purchase price of 12 West 48th Street. It was $37.2 million.

Reuters/Reuters Photographer By Robert Hogg Oct 9 (IFR) - Oil-dependent Bahrain has visited the international markets for the third time in less than a year, bearing an attractively priced deal as it battles a worsening financial situation. The sovereign received more than US$6bn in orders last week as it printed US$1bn of seven-year sukuk - its first deal in that market in five years - and a US$1bn 12-year conventional bond. "It had good timing as there is demand for higher-yielding names, and the Middle East is the right region, particularly with commodity prices recovering," said Zsolt Papp, a client portfolio manager at JP Morgan Asset Management. "It pretty much ticked all of the boxes." Advertisement The 12-year conventional tranche was initially marketed at the 7.25% area, or about 570bp over mid-swaps. For comparison, Bahrain's January 2026s were at 487bp over mid-swaps, according to Thomson Reuters. Pricing was revised to 7.125%, before launching at 7%. A banker close to the deal saw a new-issue premium on the notes at 15bp-20bp. "We saw more value in the conventional 12-year, which came slightly cheaper," said Max Wolman, portfolio manager at Aberdeen Asset Management. ILLIQUID Finding fair value for the sukuk was more difficult because of the illiquidity of Bahrain's sukuk curve. The sukuk began marketing at 6% area. Guidance was set at 5.75%-5.875%, with the notes being priced at 5.625%, or 424bp over mid-swaps. The banker on the deal saw the new-issue concession on the sukuk as anything up to 10bp. The concession was enough to attract demand, despite testing the duration appetite of domestic investors. "We had some pushback on the ratings and tenor on that one, but we had a big enough book to tighten pricing considerably," said a second lead banker. CONCERNS Bahrain printed the deal it wanted despite wider concerns about its credit quality. "Bahrain is not a great credit," said Wolman. "But it's getting enough support from the GCC that you don't need to worry about it too much. It's the highest paying of the sovereigns out there, so why not buy it" Earlier this month Oman, which is equally vulnerable to commodity prices, printed a tap of its 10-year notes at 4.708%. While Oman is investment-grade rated at Baa1/BBB-, and its bonds are index-eligible, unlike Bahrain, the latter's new 12-year notes are still offering a considerable pick-up. Bahrain's current account fell into a US$79m deficit last year. Foreign reserves have more than halved since the end of 2014, dropping well below the import cover level considered a country's comfort zone. However, Bahrain benefits from a regional development fund. The bond prospectus also revealed that Bahrain receives "significantly more" than its 50% entitlement under the Abu Saafa oilfield treaty with Saudi Arabia. The sovereign had sought to get into the market before its bigger neighbour Saudi Arabia arrives with its jumbo debut. The strategy paid off, with both bonds trading up on the break. "The issuer is very responsible," said the second lead banker. "They know they shouldn't squeeze every penny out of investors." Bahrain is rated BB stable/BB+ stable (S&P, Fitch).

Scott Gamm Oct 8, 2016 10:38 AM EDT Small business owners aren't prepared to withstand financial tremors, according to a new report by the JPMorgan Chase Institute, which analyzed data from 597,000 small businesses during an eight month period in 2015. The median small business could only survive for 27 days should cash stop coming into their business. Restaurants only had a 16-day cash cushion in reserve. According to Diana Farrell, CEO of the JPMorgan Chase Institute, the cash crunch makes small business owners feel vulnerable, which helps explain the recent declines in the closely-watched Small Business Optimism Index.

Now, finally, Wall Street is starting to believe. In recent weeks, analysts have issued glowing reports on the Indianapolis-based drugmaker’s late-stage pipeline, which they say is on the verge of delivering a wide array of promising drugs for ailments from arthritis to cancer. JP Morgan, BMO Capital Markets, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse have upgraded Lilly to a “buy” rating in the past month. In response, Lilly stock, which spent much of the past decade in the $40s and $50s, has climbed to near a 10-year high, hitting the low $80s. Several analysts say they expect the stock to hit the high $90s within a year. Lechleiter “Return to growth period is finally here!” wrote Dr. Tim Anderson, a drug analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., in an Oct. 3 report. “We believe Lilly is entering a long-lasting period of accelerating revenue and earnings-per-share growth, driven by a diversified late-stage pipeline,” wrote Jami Rubin, drug analyst at Goldman Sachs & Co., in a Sept. 27 report. Wall Street’s buy-in represents a triumph of sorts for Lilly executives, who have been telling investors to keep the faith, even as revenue flattened after the company lost patent exclusivity on older drugs for depression, osteoporosis and schizophrenia. Lilly also faced doubters when it announced a string of high-profile failures in experimental drugs aimed at multiple sclerosis, lupus and Alzheimer’s disease. However, the new vote of confidence from Wall Street also raises the pressure on Lilly to deliver. Now investors are expecting Lilly to execute its plan of moving drugs through the final months of clinical trials, then securing government approval and launching the products flawlessly. Lilly declined to comment about the turn of events. But in May, John C. Lechleiter, chairman and CEO, told investors at a JPMorgan Healthcare Conference that the company had the potential to launch 20 products in the 10 years between 2014 and 2023. “We believe we are in the midst of the most prolific period of new launches in our company’s 140-year history,” he said. So far this year, Lilly has launched drugs for psoriasis and lung cancer and a new injection pen for delivering insulin shots. In 2014, it launched two drugs for diabetes and one for cancer. It will release third-quarter earnings on Oct. 25, allowing investors a glimpse at how those early products are faring. Over the next three years, Lilly could launch up to six medicines for arthritis, cancer, migraine headaches and other maladies, several analysts say. Those products could generate $10 billion a year in new revenue by 2025, Goldman Sachs’ Rubin told clients in her note. Lilly’s revenue last year was $19.9 billion. “Our view is not based on any single product,” Rubin wrote. “In aggregate, we believe this product portfolio is among the more diversified and durable” in Big Pharma. Johnson Wall Street’s reaction seems to be a ringing endorsement of Lechleiter’s longtime strategy of avoiding large-scale mergers, as many other drug companies have done over the past decade. Instead, Lechleiter has placed his bets on Lilly’s own research, along with a few outside partnerships, to find enough big-selling innovations to keep the company independent. “When John Lechleiter laid out this strategy to groups around Indiana in 2008, it was seen as a bold and gutsy thing,” said David Johnson, CEO of the life sciences initiative BioCrossroads, which aims to expand the state’s life sciences sector. “There were not a lot of other companies doing this. I think Lilly is now showing it was the correct strategy.” Lechleiter will retire at the end of the year. He will be succeeded by Dave Ricks, now senior vice president, who has vowed to continue the go-it-alone strategy. “I haven’t a shred of evidence that any of those big mergers have created value for shareholders or other constituents,” Ricks told IBJ in September. “They’ve probably destroyed value. And frankly, when I speak to our largest investors, they think the same thing.” He called 2017 “a year of execution for us” to turn experimental drugs in the late-stage pipeline into valuable new products. Analysts view some of those potential products as low-risk, such as two cancer drugs called olaratumab and portrazza. A bigger wild card is an experimental drug called solanezumab for treating dementia in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Lilly is expected to release new data before the end of the year on a massive clinical trial that tested the drug on 2,100 patients. More than 47 million people suffer from Alzheimer’s disease, and it is now the sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. There is no effective treatment; existing drugs only alleviate symptoms temporarily. So solanezumab could generate billions of dollars a year, if successful. However, analysts say the chances are low, because two earlier trials of the same drug failed. Lilly narrowed the focus of the latest trial to patients with mild forms of the disease. The drug acts by clearing a substance called amyloid beta from the brain before it clumps together in plaques that are a trademark of dementia. Wall Street’s doubts about solanezumab grew in March, when the company said it was changing the goal of the trial to see primarily whether the drug will slow the cognitive decline of Alzheimer’s disease in patients. Another goal, measuring patients’ dailyfunctions, was downgraded to a secondary measure of the drug’s effectiveness. Lilly’s stock dropped nearly 4 percent on the news. Baker Nevertheless, several drug analysts now say they are bullish on Lilly’s pipeline, whether or not solanezumab is shown to work. “We like Lilly without solanezumab, but like it more WITH solanezumab,” Gregg Gilbert, a drug analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities wrote in a note to clients Sept. 20. He estimated that the Alzheimer’s treatment, if successful, could generate up to $2.25 billion in annual sales for Lilly by 2020. Goldman Sachs’ Rubin sees even more potential, with annual sales peaking at $7.5 billion. Anderson of Sanford Bernstein set the drug’s odds of success at 25 percent to 50 percent, but if the clinical results are positive and the drug looks like it would get FDA approval, Lilly’s stock could double within two years. “Solanezumab could ‘transform’ the company—if it works, of course,” he wrote. With so many analysts getting excited and urging clients to buy, some local financial planners say they are seeing even small clients flocking to Lilly. “Lilly stock performed poorly for years, and I think people got fed up with it and dumped it,” said Christopher Baker, a certified financial planner and co-owner of Oaktree Financial Advisors in Carmel, whose clients include hundreds of Lilly workers and retirees. “Now, people are saying, ‘I’m going to hold onto it for a while and see what happens,”Baker said. “We’ve definitely seen a shift.”   Email Tweet ADVERTISEMENT Reporter Healthcare, life sciences, education Health Care & Life Sciences Weekly Industry e-newsletter writer Phone: (317) 472-5383 Follow John Russellon Twitter: www.twitter.com/JohnRussell99 all’s career as a journalist was set in fifth grade, when he took on an afternoon paper route for The Indianapolis News.

 'It is a game changer': Banks ponder the meaning of life as Deutsche Bank agonizes Carmel Crimmins and Olivia Oran, Reuters Oct. 9, 2016, 7:57 AM 3,370 facebook linkedin twitter email print A statue is pictured next to the logo of Germany's Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt Thomson Reuters WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It wasn't just Deutsche Bank that was grappling with big questions about the future at the International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington last week. The German bank is scrambling to overhaul its operations as it faces a multi-billion dollar fine for selling toxic mortgage-backed securities in the United States. But many others in the banking industry are also still figuring out what they should be doing, nearly a decade after the financial crisis, as they grapple with anemic economic growth, wafer-thin returns on lending and the possibility that regulators will further hike their cost of doing business. “This new world of low interest rates and even negative interest rates is something that is very difficult,” said Frederic Oudea, the chief executive of French bank Societe Generale. “It is a game changer, not just for banks but for the whole financial industry,” he told an audience from the Institute of International Finance (IIF), a trade group for big banks that holds its annual meeting alongside the IMF. Deutsche Bank’s immediate obstacle is the U.S. Department of Justice's demand for a massive fine over the sale of bad mortgage bonds that could far exceed the 5.5 billion euros ($6.2 billion) in provisions that the bank has set aside. Such a bill could require it to raise more capital. Peter Terium, CEO of RWE and Carsten Kengeter, CEO of Deutsche Boerse pose at the stock exchange in Frankfurt Thomson Reuters But Deutsche Bank’s fundamental problem is that its large investment banking business doesn’t fit the post-crisis era. Chief Executive John Cryan is in the middle of an overhaul, cutting jobs and selling assets. But with interest rates showing no signs of lifting, he needs to move fast. Since the crisis of 2008, banks on both sides of the Atlantic have shored up their defenses against future losses, adding hundreds of billions of dollars in equity capital and shedding loss-making assets. Sergio Ermotti, the chief executive officer of Swiss bank UBS, said those defenses had proved their worth in recent weeks when other European banks were largely insulated from the lurch in Deutsche Bank’s shares. But with rates expected to stay lower for longer, more banks will be under pressure to change with the IMF warning last week that lenders in Germany, Italy and Portugal needed to take urgent action to address old, non-performing loans and bloated, inefficient business models. “Crisis is the wrong word. We are in the middle inning of the reshaping of the financial landscape,” said Mark McCombe, global head of institutional client business at asset manager BlackRock. The meaning of life U.S. bankers attending the IIF meeting were far more upbeat than their European counterparts. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, Morgan Stanley head James Gorman and Citigroup boss Michael Corbat, did their version of the "Three Amigos," taking to the stage together to talk up the strength of the U.S. consumer and their own roles in the global economy. In a separate session, Goldman Sachs Group President Gary Cohn said the U.S. banking system was in the "best shape it has ever, ever been by far." Like their European rivals, many U.S. banks are struggling to get shareholder returns above their cost of capital, but they are making more progress because they wrote off larger portions of their bad loans earlier – enabling them to return to growth more quickly – and most of their crisis-era litigation costs are behind them. The U.S. economy is also improving at a faster clip than Europe. “Is it sustainable for any sector to have a return on equity in the long-term that is below what shareholders expect? I don’t think so. Shareholders have been, so far, relatively patient. We should aim to sort out what can be sorted out,” said Oudea. Britain's vote to exit the European Union, known as "Brexit," is another headwind facing international banks, with the UK financial industry risking a loss of up to 38 billion pounds ($48.34 billion) in revenue if the country has only limited access to the European Union's single market, according to one study. "The big winner for Brexit will be New York; you'll see more business moving to New York," Gorman said at the IIF meeting. The competition from technology companies in banks' traditional markets, such as lending and payments, has also ramped up the pressure to change. In the pre-crisis days, banks would have merged to cut costs, but regulators are now much less in favor of allowing the creation of big, cross-border lenders which could disrupt markets if they got into trouble. Instead, banks are left to swing the ax where they can and ideally build big market positions in areas that are not penalized by big capital charges, such as consumer lending and asset management. “The transformation process is still ongoing and it is painful," said Alex Manson, global head of transaction banking at Standard Chartered Bank. "But the quicker you can define what it is you stand for, the quicker you can go to execution from meaning of life mode.” Read the original article on Reuters. Copyright 2016.

The company will withdraw its proposal to raise as much as 2.45 trillion won ($2.2 billion) and will submit a revised plan soon, Doosan Infracore Co., the biggest shareholder of Doosan Bobcat, said in a regulatory filing in Seoul Monday. It expects to list shares in November or January, instead of its earlier planned Oct. 21, the company said in an e-mailed statement. “There were concerns that the IPO was priced too high and there were too many shares being sold,” said Lee Jae Won, an analyst at Yuanta Securities Korea Co. in Seoul. “The stock market has been trading in a narrow range these past few years, so investors are wary about any stock that’s offered at what they believe is a high valuation.” It’s the second pull back of an IPO in South Korea, which had the second-worst performance of listings among major Asian bourses. In June, Hotel Lotte Co. dropped its 5.26 trillion won offering even after lowering the sale price. Doosan Infracore fell 7.2 percent, the most since June, to close at 7,200 won in Seoul trading. Doosan Engine Co., the world’s second-biggest maker of ship engines and a shareholder of Doosan Bobcat, dropped 11 percent to 3,630 won, the largest decline in almost a year. Too Many “There were too many shares being offered and a few issues that didn’t meet market conditions,” Doosan Bobcat said in the statement. “While there was demand, we were unable to come to an accord that satisfied those involved. In that respect, we will re-look at the IPO structure, including the number of shares, to fit the market conditions and proceed with the IPO again.” Shareholders of Doosan Bobcat had offered about 49 million existing shares at 41,000 won to 50,000 won apiece. Doosan Infracore, Doosan Engine Co. and other investors planned to sell some of their shareholdings in the IPO. The Seoul-based company, which got about 70 percent of its sales of 4.04 trillion won last year from North America, has been seeking to expand in emerging markets including China and Latin America, to generate more growth opportunities. Sale Arrangers Korea Investment & Securities Co. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are leading the offering. Credit Suisse Group AG, HSBC Holdings Plc, Hanwha Investment & Securities Co. and Shinyoung Securities Co. are also helping arrange the share sale. Doosan Infracore bought Ingersoll-Rand Co.’s Bobcat business and other equipment units in 2007 for $4.9 billion, the biggest overseas deal by a South Korean company. Doosan Bobcat posted 234.8 billion won in operating profit in the first half of this year and generated sales of 2.15 trillion won, the company said. Its operating margins widened to 10.92 percent in the first half, from 9.54 percent for 2015. The company pursued a listing after South Korean policy makers revised IPO rules late last year. The regulator loosened documentation requirements for Korean companies with businesses abroad, making it easier for firms like Doosan Bobcat that have many overseas units.

Yellen will speak at a conference in Boston on Friday, in the wake of a Labor Department report last Friday that underpinned bets that the Fed will raise rates before the end of the year. US employers added 156,000 workers in September, compared with an upwardly revised 167,000 in August. In a Reuters poll after the September jobs data, 14 of 15 primary dealers, banks that do business directly with the Fed, forecast a rate hike at the central bank's December meeting. This compared with 13 of 14 dealers in a Sept. 2 poll following the August jobs report. Meanwhile, traders now are pricing a 64 percent chance of an increase in December, up from 53 percent the previous week, and a 17 percent chance of a hike as early as November, according to Bloomberg. With the heightening prospect of a rate rise, Wall Street retreated on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.2 percent, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index retreated 0.3 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index also slid 0.3 percent. The US dollar however strengthened. It will rise to US$1.05 against the euro by the end of the year from US$1.1201 on Friday, according to Deutsche Bank’s forecasts. "The dollar will get reasonable support into that period of time between the elections and the Fed tightening," Alan Ruskin, global co-head of foreign-exchange research in New York at Deutsche Bank, told Bloomberg. "It will be hard to shift the market expectations in terms of a Fed rate hike in December." Before Yellen, other Fed officials scheduled to speak this week include Chicago Fed President Charles Evans today, New York Fed's William Dudley and Kansas City Fed's Esther George on Wednesday, Philadelphia Fed's Patrick Harder on Thursday, and Boston Fed's Eric Rosengren on Friday. Meanwhile, Alcoa, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are among companies to kickstart the latest US quarterly earnings season. "If there's something that can help the outlook for earnings, then it's going to be good news for the stock market. It is the most important variable," Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors in Albany, New York, told Reuters. "What's needed is something that's going to make this look undervalued." Last week, the Dow dropped 0.4 percent, while the S&P 500 slid 0.7 percent and the Nasdaq declined 0.4 percent. The latest clues on the US economic state of affairs will show up in the form of reports on the labour market conditions index, due today; the NFIB small business optimism index, due Tuesday; weekly jobless claims and import and export prices, due Thursday; as well as the producer price index, retail sales, business inventories, and consumer sentiment, due Friday. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index fell 0.9 percent on Friday. The pound sank, hitting fresh three-decade lows on Friday, amid fresh concerns about the impact of a ‘hard’ Brexit on the nation’s economy. Bank of England Governor Mark Carney is set to speak on Friday.

And it turns out those companies spending big bucks investing in Washington see huge rewards. That's all at the expense of the American taxpayer… but we'll get to that next. First, we'll show you how nothing beats — or even comes close — to gains wrought from corporate welfare… Political Spending Yields the Biggest Returns by Far In 2014, the Sunlight Foundation, a non-partisan nonprofit a group that wants government transparency, conducted a study of political spending over the 2007 to 2012 period. It looked at the lobbying expenditures and campaign donations of the 200 companies most politically active in the United States- and in particular, what each got in return. Results showed the political spending of the 200 companies it identified was about $5.8 billion over the six years. In return, those companies got an astounding $4.4 trillion in corporate welfare. Put another way, every dollar of political spending generated a return on investment of $760 for these private companies. That's a gain of 76,000% over just six years. These figures may seem incredulous, but changes in government policy can have a tremendous impact on a company's profits. Companies that land government contracts are doing business with the most lucrative client in the world. And because the period of the study encompassed the 2008 financial crisis, generous bailouts also were part of the mix. "As middle-class Americans lost ground, the 'Fixed Fortune 200' got what they needed. What they needed included loans that helped automakers and banks survive the recent recession while many homeowners went under," the Sunlight Foundation study said. "It included budget busting emergency measures that funneled extra dollars to everything from defense contractors to public utility companies to financial industry giants."

Read more… Over the six-year period, the 200 companies in the study won a third of the money doled out in $3 billion worth of government contracts. And they got 73% of the $410 billion distributed under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The Sunlight Foundation study also found that the corporate welfare firehose flowed just as generously when Democrats were in power as it did when Republicans were in power. Likewise, the political spending favored neither party, as the companies are less interested in influencing who gets elected than having influence over the winners. The 200 companies in the study include most major industries, including energy, banking, technology, healthcare, entertainment, and consumer goods. Many are household names, such as Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT), Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), McDonald's Corp. (NYSE: MCD), United Parcel Service Inc. (NYSE: UPS), and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT). And several of these iconic companies received king-sized amounts of corporate welfare, much more than the average for the 200 in the study. But here's the real kicker: Over the same period in the Foundation's study (2007 to 2012), individual taxpayers contributed $6.5 trillion to the U.S. Treasury. That means this corporate welfare swallowed up about two-thirds of that. You see, the bulk of the hundreds of billions of dollars bestowed on these mega-corporations comes from the taxes drawn from the average working American. This is where your tax dollars are really going… Companies Receiving the Most Corporate Welfare Join the conversation.

Sean Silcoff The Globe and Mail Published Wednesday, Oct. 05, 2016 8:00AM EDT Last updated Wednesday, Oct. 05, 2016 8:08AM EDT Comments Print / License AA The era of mass digital disruption has brought unprecedented anxiety to C-suites across the corporate world – but Canadian companies lag their global peers in responding to the looming threats from algorithm-wielding competitors. Those are among the findings in a survey of 4,000 executives across 12 industries in 16 developed countries by British research firm Vanson Bourne commissioned by Dell Technologies Inc. According to the American computing giant, 52 per cent of those surveyed earlier in 2016 experienced significant disruption in their industries over the past three years brought on by new digital technologies. Just under half say they don’t know what their industries will look like in three years, and 45 per cent admit they may become obsolete within five. More than three in four see digital startups as a threat, and 72 per cent are expanding their software development capabilities in response. On average, respondents said they were far less capable of digitally delivering the security, access to information or services that customers demanded. “If companies can’t keep up, they will fall behind … or worse,” Dell chief marketing officer Jeremy Burton said in a statement. At a time when “software is eating the world,” according to a Silicon Valley saying, many established companies, Mr. Burton said, “haven’t written a line of code in 20 years.” The Dell survey reveals Canada to be a “digital laggard,” ranking 13th out of 16 countries in its “digital transformation index,” a composite of factors measuring what companies are doing to catch up digitally. India and Brazil led the pack, while, oddly, economic powerhouses China and Japan ranked last. The survey found 35 per cent of Canadian companies have experienced significant industry disruption in the past three years, compared to 52 per cent overall. While 62 per cent of all respondents said they had seen new competitors emerge, in Canada it was 48 per cent among the 200 people interviewed. “We don’t measurably feel the same global competitive pressure” in Canada, said Carolyn Rollins, director of U.S. & Canada commercial regional marketing with Dell Canada. At a time of widespread Internet and smartphone usage, whole industries have been disrupted. Traditional retailers were among the first to feel the squeeze from e-commerce giants such as Amazon and Alibaba – while commercial landlords are expected to face challenges as merchants shrink their physical store networks in the coming years. Media firms have sustained significant losses in conventional advertising revenue and have been retreating from print – including Rogers Communications Inc., which said last week it is substantially scaling down its magazine publishing business. Growth in digital ad revenue has largely shifted to search and social media giants Google and Facebook. Financial services firms are under threat by so-called “fintech” firms, and some industry watchers say this could dramatically impact their profitability in the future. “Silicon Valley is coming,” JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned shareholders last year. Bank of Nova Scotia CEO Brian Porter recently told The Globe and Mail: “We’re in the technology business.” “Sharing economy” upstarts such as AirBnB and Uber have also disrupted the hospitality and transportation industries. On the horizon are impacts yet to be felt by the arrival of driverless cars and smarter machines poised to displace millions of white-collar workers. “There are a large number of organizations where [how to manage digital transformation] is an unknown or something they’re afraid to address – or where they don’t have the talent or capability to move the business forward,” said Ms. Rollins. Meanwhile, there is a global shortage of employees with skills to program the technology of the future; only British Columbia and Nova Scotia among Canadian provinces have begun to offer coding on a widespread basis as part of school curriculums, while Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne instructed her education minister Mitzie Hunter just last month to “develop a strategy … that considers opportunities for computer coding.” “Technical literacy [will be] absolutely fundamental to doing everything in the future,” said Tobi Lutke, CEO of Ottawa-based retail software firm Shopify Inc. Dell said many companies are now pursuing digital strategies including partnering with startups – as several Canadian financial institutions are doing – assigning executives to leading digital transformation efforts or integrating digital goals into their objectives. The company has a vested interest in publishing the survey: Dell markets itself as an “end-to-end” vendor that helps large organizations digitize their businesses. The company did not release information on the margin for error in the survey.

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola)   Jonnelle Marte The Washington Post     People who need to send cash to friends or relatives to, say, split the monthly bills or pay each other back after a night out, finally have better options. Sure, sending money to friends is easier today than it was back when writing a check or running to an ATM were our only options. But even with the rise of person-to-person money transferring apps such as Venmo, most people still have to wait at least a day before money can be transferred from their Venmo accounts to their actual bank accounts. Because of that and other lags, many people still use actual cash when handling these smaller transactions. The good news is that a slew of upgrades and new services being rolled out now and over the next couple of months are speeding up how quickly we can move money digitally. (At last.) "Right now we're at the very beginning of sea changes for payments for consumers and for businesses," says Jane Larimer, executive vice president of Nacha, which administers the network financial firms use to send money between banks. Here's an overview of the ways that money is starting to move faster: • Banks upgrade their networks The 1970s-era technology that banks use to transfer money securely to other financial firms is finally getting an upgrade. The network, known as the Automated Clearing House (ACH), previously processed payment requests only once a day, typically overnight. That meant that it could take one to three business days for a cash transfer to clear. (It's the reason you need to schedule online bill payments at least three days before the due date, and why it could be a few days before the money in your PayPal account shows up in your bank.) But as of Sept. 23, the ACH system now processes transfer requests at least three times a day. The first step in a long awaited upgrade makes it possible for transfers to be completed in the same day that they're initiated. For instance, an employer can now submit a direct deposit request for an employee in the morning and have the money show up in the worker's bank account that evening, Larimer says. Because these transfers typically happen behind the scenes, consumers may not notice much of a change. Small businesses or other companies may find that the faster processing system makes it possible for them to offer direct deposit to their employees now that they no longer have to start the process three days in advance, Larimer says. But as further improvements are introduced, some consumers may notice faster paychecks, speedier bill payment services and other upgrades to the way they send cash electronically, she adds. • Zelle, the wannabe Venmo-killer. In an effort to battle Venmo, Square Cash and other third-party cash transferring services, some of the nation's largest banks joined forces this year to roll out a service that lets consumers send each other money within minutes. The transfer service has been rolled out quietly over the past couple of months by big banks including Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Capital One and U.S. Bank. Customers of participating banks can use their mobile banking apps to send money to friends using their email address or phone number and have it processed in the same day. The faster service is part of an upgrade to clearXchange, a person-to-person payment network that banks use to let consumers send each other money. Previously, only people who used the same bank could send each other cash instantly. Sending money to someone at another bank used to take at least a day. The network will be rebranded and promoted next year under the name "Zelle." In the meantime, consumers can access the service through their bank's own money transferring service. For example, Chase's person-to-person service is called QuickPay and Wells Fargo's program is called SurePay. • PayPal, Venmo and others speeding up. Starting next year, most consumers with money in their Venmo or PayPal accounts will be able to instantly move that cash to their bank accounts. The upgrade will speed up the current system, which requires users to wait at least a day before the money shows up in their accounts. PayPal, which owns Venmo, announced this summer that it would partner with Visa and MasterCard to make the faster cash-outs possible for customers with a Visa or MasterCard debit card. (Both of the credit card issuers have recently introduced their own real-time money transferring services.) By making it easier for people to transfer money to their banks, PayPal hopes that consumers will use the service to shop or send money more frequently, a spokesman said. But the change will also be beneficial for small business owners, roommates or other people closely depending on the money in their Venmo or PayPal accounts, the company says. Consumers are catching on to the new options. ClearXchange moved more than $16 billion in person-to-person money transfers in the first quarter, compared to the $3.2 billion moved by Venmo in the same time period. But people may be using the services differently. A typical transfer through clearXchange is larger than $350, while a normal Venmo transfer ranges from $25 to $40, according to an analysis by Credit Suisse.

 Goldman Sachs could move 2,000 jobs out of the UK if there's a 'Hard Brexit' Oscar Williams-Grut Oct. 9, 2016, 6:57 AM 1,206 facebook linkedin twitter email print Lloyd Blankfein, Chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs. Mark Lennihan / AP/Press Association Images Goldman Sachs is preparing plans to move around 2,000 British jobs overseas if the UK loses its financial passporting rights after Brexit, according to the Sunday Times. The newspaper cites an unnamed City sources as saying that the investment bank is looking at moving a third of its 6,000 strong UK workforce to mainland Europe in the event of a "Hard Brexit." A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs told Business Insider: "We continue to work through all possible implications of the Brexit vote. There remain numerous uncertainties as to what the Brexit negotiations will yield in terms of an operating framework for the banking industry. As a result, we have not taken any decisions as to what our eventual response will be, despite media speculation to the contrary." "Hard Brexit" is the term used to describe the UK cutting off all relations with Europe and prioritising control over immigration, as opposed to maintaining some economic links in return for concessions on freedom of movement. One of the things that would be lost in a "Hard Brexit" would be passporting rights, which allow financial firms to operate across the EU using their local licence rather than apply to be regulated in each new market. The loss of passporting rights would be devastating to the City of London. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said earlier this year that 5,500 UK companies rely on passporting rights, with a combined turnover of £9 billion. JPMorgan and UBS have both already publically stated that they will have to relocate part of their British workforce in the event of a "Hard Brexit" and Deutsche Bank has prepared an internal document, obtained by Business Insider, showing where they think investment banks will likely relocate jobs to after Brexit. Goldman said in a recent regulatory filing in the US that the Brexit vote "may adversely affect the manner in which we operate certain of our businesses in the European Union and could require us to restructure certain of our operations."
