Corrado Passera, who as well as being a former industry minister served as chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo, is working with private equity firms including Warburg Pincus on a plan that includes a reserved capital increase of 2.0-2.5 billion euros, the sources said. Two of the sources said none of the funds approached by Passera had committed to backing the plan and while they were open to doing a deal, this was subject to due diligence. Another source said no deal was imminent. It is far from certain that Monte dei Paschi will turn to Passera, who was not immediately available for comment, or that his scheme would stand a better chance of success than JPMorgan's, one of the sources said. And a source close to the JPMorgan-led consortium of investment banks said they were pressing ahead with their plan and were confident it would succeed. OLDEST BUT WEAKEST The sources said private equity funds who have been working with Passera trust his ability to turn around the Siena-based bank, the world's oldest, which in July emerged as the weakest lender in the latest round of European stress tests. Monte dei Paschi's board rejected in July a last-minute attempt by Passera to put forward a rescue plan backed by Swiss investment bank UBS, a long-standing adviser to the Tuscan bank. It approved instead the privately-backed rescue arranged by JPMorgan with the help of Mediobanca. However, the deal has since ran into trouble, senior bankers say. A preliminary survey of investors over the summer found scant interest in a third cash call in as many years, while analysts have questioned the feasibility of a capital raising that totals 10 times the bank's current market value. Last month, Monte dei Paschi abruptly replaced chief executive Fabrizio Viola with the head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch in Italy, Marco Morelli, in the hope of winning investors confidence and is now studying a debt-to-equity conversion to cut the size of the share sale. JPMorgan is also looking for investors to back a reserved share sale but has yet to find any, several sources said. Recent talks with a sovereign wealth fund fell through, one of the sources said, raising fears the bank may need state aid. Most foreign investors are unwilling to commit any cash until a Dec. 4 referendum on constitutional reform that could unseat Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's government, bankers say. "No investment committee will ever approve a deal for Monte dei Paschi without knowing the outcome of the Italian referendum," an investor close to the bank said.

For patient, long-term investors, you could do a lot worse than JPMorgan Chase. John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 6, 2016 at 11:47AM Chase Tower in Phoenix, Arizone. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Warren Buffett has said in the past that it's "far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price." To me, this describes JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) to a tee. America's biggest bank JPMorgan Chase didn't become the biggest bank in America by accident. It emerged atop the industry in the wake of the financial crisis. Its two principal competitors at the time, Bank of America and Citigroup, had to run hat in hand to the federal government for funds to survive. In JPMorgan Chase's case, the exact opposite was true. The government approached it for help to bail out Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual. This happened eight years ago, but it's the culture at JPMorgan Chase that positioned it to thrive through the crisis. And that culture is still present, overseen by chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. No human being is infallible and I'm sure that Dimon has plenty of his own shortcomings, but everything I've read, seen, and heard about him suggests that he's one of this generation's best bankers. Richard Bove, an experienced and respected bank analyst, once told me that Dimon is one of the smartest people he's ever met. Warren Buffett's take on JPMorgan Chase And you don't just have to take my word for it. Buffett has said in the past that Dimon's annual shareholder letter is a must read. And one of Buffett's lieutenants just joined the JPMorgan Chase board. That's about the best seal of approval that a bank can get, when you consider that Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has accumulated the most impressive portfolio of bank stocks since the days of the Money Trust in the early 1900s. All of this matters because, as Buffett explained in his 1990 shareholder letter, the quality of executives at a bank is more important than in any other business: When assets are twenty times equity -- a common ratio in [the bank] industry -- mistakes that involve only a small portion of assets can destroy a major portion of equity. And mistakes have been the rule rather than the exception at many major banks. Most have resulted from a managerial failing that we described last year when discussing the "institutional imperative:" the tendency of executives to mindlessly imitate the behavior of their peers, no matter how foolish it may be to do so. In their lending, many bankers played follow-the-leader with lemming-like zeal; now they are experiencing a lemming-like fate. A low valuation Making JPMorgan Chase even more attractive is the fact that its shares trade at a fair price. They're priced at less than 1.1 times book value while the average bank on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen large-cap bank stocks, is priced at just under 1.2 times book. Think about that for a second. JPMorgan Chase is one of the best-run banks in the country, yet its shares trade for less than the typical large-cap bank. Part of this is because the nation's biggest banks are subject to stricter regulations surrounding capital, liquidity, and stress testing, among other things. The environment right now is also unusually inhospitable for banks, thanks to ultralow interest rates and higher regulatory and compliance costs. Another explanation for JPMorgan Chase's low valuation, in my opinion, stems from the reputational damage that's been done to the industry during and after the 2008 crisis. All banks are trading for low multiples right now, not just JPMorgan Chase, but the big banks suffered the brunt of the damage to their reputations. This may seem like it's unusual, but it's standard operating procedure in a cyclical industry. The same thing happened after the Panic of 1907, the Great Depression, and the multiple crises of the 1980s. When things turn around and interest rates belatedly rise, then banks like JPMorgan Chase will make a lot more money. That will send bank share prices up and reward investors who get in now. In short, every once in a while you get the chance to, in Buffett's words, "buy a wonderful company at a fair price." This is one of those times. John Maxfield owns shares of Bank of America.

China’s surge in home prices reminds JPMorgan Asset Management’s chief Asia market strategist of last year’s stock market mania. Spiraling leverage and implicit state support are among the common denominators, he says. Shanghai property values jumped 31 percent in August from a year earlier, the latest data show. In 2015, a 60 percent rally in the city’s equities through June 12 was followed by a $5 trillion rout. Deutsche Bank Group AG warned last month that China’s housing market is in a bubble, while Goldman Sachs Group AG said this week it sees growing risks across the real estate industry. Home prices started to take off last year in the wake of the stock market crash after the governments eased curbs on property purchases. In recent days, cities including Shenzhen have started re-imposing restrictions. “It’s similar to the equity market where if you let things loose, it just runs like a stallion," said Hui. "And then you have to really rein it back, then it’s like an ice bucket challenge. So you go through this extreme heat and cold. That’s not particularly good for the economy because then you’re going through very aggressive investment cycles." At stake is the government’s ability to channel funds trapped by capital controls into investments that can boost the economy without creating asset bubbles. Speculative buying of commodity futures earlier this year fueled a boom that quickly unraveled, while a botched intervention to halt plummeting equities dented the credibility of policy makers and roiled global markets. Just as the surge in stocks in the first half of 2015 enervated financial services and provided a fillip to an ailing economy, rampant demand for property is boosting the outlook for commodities and lifting the earnings outlook for construction-related firms. Profits of industrial companies jumped the most in three years in August, while factory output, investment and retail sales also beat analysts’ estimates. Home prices started to climb after China eased mortgage policies and down-payment requirements in March 2015 to arrest what was then a slide in prices. New curbs, such as higher deposits to limits on the number of homes people can buy, are proving ineffective given the easy access homebuyers have to leverage, said Wee May Ling, an investment manager at Henderson Global Investors Ltd. Mortgage Lending Medium and long-term new loans, mostly mortgages, totaled 529 billion yuan ($79 billion) in August, while aggregate financing jumped to 1.47 trillion yuan, helping fuel a 39 percent jump in property sales by value in the first eight months. Private investment in fixed assets, meanwhile, stalled at 2.1 percent for a second straight month in the January through August period, matching a record low. While HSBC Holdings Plc says the overall level of China’s household debt remains low, Deutsche Bank said it sees "clear sign of a bubble" in property -- one that will end in a major correction in two years’ time. Just like last year’s equity boom, China is using credit growth to boost the economy, Zhiwei Zhang, chief China economist at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a report on Sept. 28. “The main concern about China is that it has reverted back to the old model in terms of stimulating growth by monetary and credit side," said Philipp Baertschi, Zurich-based chief investment officer at Bank J. Safra Sarasin Ltd. Higher Costs To be sure, there are signs policy makers are acting to restrain growth in debt. The People’s Bank of China has kept its benchmark lending and deposit rates on hold for nearly a year and banks’ reserve ratios unchanged since February, failing to deliver the additional cuts private economists had forecast in earlier surveys. The central bank has also used longer-term tenors in the open market to drive up funding costs in a bid to rein in leverage. Still, any winding down of debt brings its own risks. “We saw the stock market tumble in 2015 from June throughout the second half, triggered by the unwinding of leverage after margin lending reached record highs," said Jing Ulrich, vice chairman of Asia Pacific at JPMorgan Chase & Co. "Today, an alarming sign is that leverage is also building in the property market." While analysts aren’t predicting home prices to collapse in the manner of the stock market, last year’s experience shows the risk of allowing a leverage-fueled boom to spiral out of control. China’s equity bubble began inflating in late 2014 as policy makers touted the importance of equity financing and state media ran a series of articles promoting the market. As the buzz around shares grew, and home prices stagnated, investors opened new trading accounts at a record pace and took on unprecedented amounts of margin debt. Sixteen months after the Shanghai Composite Index peaked, China’s $6.4 trillion equity market remains subdued. Turnover has, by one measure, fallen to the lowest in two years. A gauge of technology shares, last year’s hottest investment, is down 21 percent this year, while margin debt is still some 60 percent below its peak. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index dropped 0.6 percent on Friday, with mainland markets closed this week. JPMorgan’s Hui says China appears to be repeating the mistakes of the past. "The government seems to just go through wild swings when it comes to control and let things loose because they want growth coming back," he said. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The 45th anniversary of the annual ranking of Wall Street's top equity analysts begs the question: Why does the buy side still buy sell-side research? Since May Day 1975, when 180 years of fixed brokerage commissions ended on Wall Street, prognosticators have insisted that sell-side equity research's days were numbered, and doom-and-gloomers saw the relationship between sell-side research and buy-side investing as imperiled. And yet year after year, the sell side has proven surprisingly resilient. Nicholas Rosato, head of North American Research for JPMorgan, argues that for all the fears and fluctuations, what has not changed over the decades is the mutually beneficial relationship with the buy side. "The buy side continues to need and value sell-side research," Rosato affirms. Institutional Investor launched the All-America Research Team ranking in 1972, three years before May Day. The ranking's longevity is evidence of the ability of sell-side research to evolve, adjust and change. "The Institutional Investor All-America Research poll continues to set the standard to identify excellence within the Investment Research ecosystem," says Will Rowlands-Rees, Managing Director of II Research. "This year we saw voters in particular really focus on the Economics/Strategy sectors, with a material increase in overall voting. With an uncertain global macro environment, this doesn't surprise. It just reinforces the continued importance of this process to provide actionable product feedback between Buy and Sell side," he adds. The team is the buy side's judgment on the performance of its outsourced providers of investment analysis; it's an election, not a stock-picking contest. And this year's election has a new victor. JPMorgan had held top honors for five consecutive years, until Bank of America Merrill Lynch edged ahead of it last year. This year, JPMorgan regains its crown with 40 analysts voted on the team -- an improvement of four over 2015 -- beating out BofA Merrill, which saw its total fall by six, to 32. Rounding out this year's top ten firms: 1. J.P. Morgan 2. Bank of America Merrill Lynch 3. Evercore ISI 4. UBS 5. Morgan Stanley 6. Barclays 7. Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. 8. Deutsche Bank Securities 9. RBC Capital Markets 10. Citi In all, this year's team includes 322 analysts from 30 firms. To see the full team, including all ranked firms and analysts, visit www.institutionalinvestor.com/aart. Among the investment trends uncovered by this year's results: In a topsy-turvy year, investors turned to top firms. Eight out of the top ten firms saw their numbers rise, notably Evercore ISI, from 25 to 30, and UBS, from 22 to 28. That was not the case in 2015, but it may suggest that in a topsy-turvy year, investors turned to the top firms, which tend to be larger and more diversified. When it's quality over quantity, JPMorgan is king. The weighted average paints a different picture than the overall leaderboard. This measure gives greater credence to getting higher-ranked analysts voted onto the team. JPMorgan runs away with the weighted average, as it has for a number of years, in which a rating of four is assigned to each first-place position, three to each second-place spot, and so on. The bank racks up 109 points to the No. 2 shop, Evercore ISI, with 79. BofA Merrill slides to fourth this year, with a weighted average of 59. A volatile year led to movement in the ranks by weighted average. Evercore ISI rises from No. 3 in 2015 to No. 2, while UBS hops three spots from No. 6 to No. 3. On weighted average, however, four firms -- UBS, BofA Merrill, Bernstein and Morgan Stanley, both based in New York -- come out neck and neck, with only five points separating No. 3, UBS, and No. 5, Morgan Stanley. Many of the favorite stocks of 2015 fell from favor in 2016. This year's market was one in which much of the gains were coming from a narrowing universe of stocks. An active, value-oriented stock-picker's market -- the kind sell-side research traditionally served -- shifted to big-cap, dividend, share-buyback or defensive plays as the year unfolded. U.S. stock markets profited from investors globally seeking yield, but as Brian Hodess, who runs Bank of America Merrill Lynch's U.S. research effort, says, more than half of fund managers still believe the market is overvalued. A complex set of macroeconomic factors forced sell-side researchers to collaborate. "Brexit, the ECB, the Fed, the Bank of Japan, China -- all have played into an approach of mixing macro research and stock research," says Vinayak Singh, a member of Evercore ISI's executive, management and investment committee. "That requires a tremendous amount of collaboration." At the very least, this kind of research throws up barriers of entry to smaller research shops lacking scale, reach and financial resources. Evercore's Singh talks about talent migration to the bigger firms and consolidation of the sell side. The evidence for that may be in the greater concentration of ranked analysts among the top-ten firms. As it has since 1975, the question of who will pay for sell-side research looms. In Europe, a much-discussed regulatory policy known as Markets in Financial Instruments Directives II (MIFID II) mandates that research be unbundled from commissions, among many other changes, looks like it will finally be implemented on January 2018. U.S. research is not immune. The major firms have European clients and clients that do business on the Continent. The effect? There's some debate about that, but clearly true unbundling will encourage firms to support individual analysts over entire groups, or some firms over others. "If you're in a middle tier, and you don't have products of excellence, you could lose sales," says David Adelman, the director of Morgan Stanley's Americas equity research group. That's slowly occurring anyway in the U.S., he adds, "as clients concentrate their research vote." The 2016 All-America Research Team survey results reflect the opinions of some 3,835 individuals at 1,090 firms, including more than 90 of the 100 biggest U.S. equity managers. Our respondents manage an estimated $11.57 trillion in U.S. equities. For full ranking results, analysis and methodology, visit www.institutionalinvestor.com/aart.

Since May Day 1975, when 180 years of fixed brokerage commissions ended on Wall Street, prognosticators have insisted that sell-side equity research's days were numbered, and doom-and-gloomers saw the relationship between sell-side research and buy-side investing as imperiled. And yet year after year, the sell side has proven surprisingly resilient. Nicholas Rosato, head of North American Research for JPMorgan, argues that for all the fears and fluctuations, what has not changed over the decades is the mutually beneficial relationship with the buy side. "The buy side continues to need and value sell-side research," Rosato affirms. Institutional Investor launched the All-America Research Team ranking in 1972, three years before May Day. The ranking's longevity is evidence of the ability of sell-side research to evolve, adjust and change. "The Institutional Investor All-America Research poll continues to set the standard to identify excellence within the Investment Research ecosystem," says Will Rowlands-Rees, Managing Director of II Research. "This year we saw voters in particular really focus on the Economics/Strategy sectors, with a material increase in overall voting. With an uncertain global macro environment, this doesn't surprise. It just reinforces the continued importance of this process to provide actionable product feedback between Buy and Sell side," he adds. The team is the buy side's judgment on the performance of its outsourced providers of investment analysis; it's an election, not a stock-picking contest. And this year's election has a new victor. JPMorgan had held top honors for five consecutive years, until Bank of America Merrill Lynch edged ahead of it last year. This year, JPMorgan regains its crown with 40 analysts voted on the team -- an improvement of four over 2015 -- beating out BofA Merrill, which saw its total fall by six, to 32. Rounding out this year's top ten firms: 1. J.P. Morgan 2. Bank of America Merrill Lynch 3. Evercore ISI 4. UBS 5. Morgan Stanley 6. Barclays 7. Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. 8. Deutsche Bank Securities 9. RBC Capital Markets 10. Citi In all, this year's team includes 322 analysts from 30 firms. To see the full team, including all ranked firms and analysts, visit www.institutionalinvestor.com/aart. Among the investment trends uncovered by this year's results: In a topsy-turvy year, investors turned to top firms. Eight out of the top ten firms saw their numbers rise, notably Evercore ISI, from 25 to 30, and UBS, from 22 to 28. That was not the case in 2015, but it may suggest that in a topsy-turvy year, investors turned to the top firms, which tend to be larger and more diversified. When it's quality over quantity, JPMorgan is king. The weighted average paints a different picture than the overall leaderboard. This measure gives greater credence to getting higher-ranked analysts voted onto the team. JPMorgan runs away with the weighted average, as it has for a number of years, in which a rating of four is assigned to each first-place position, three to each second-place spot, and so on. The bank racks up 109 points to the No. 2 shop, Evercore ISI, with 79. BofA Merrill slides to fourth this year, with a weighted average of 59. A volatile year led to movement in the ranks by weighted average. Evercore ISI rises from No. 3 in 2015 to No. 2, while UBS hops three spots from No. 6 to No. 3. On weighted average, however, four firms -- UBS, BofA Merrill, Bernstein and Morgan Stanley, both based in New York -- come out neck and neck, with only five points separating No. 3, UBS, and No. 5, Morgan Stanley. Many of the favorite stocks of 2015 fell from favor in 2016. This year's market was one in which much of the gains were coming from a narrowing universe of stocks. An active, value-oriented stock-picker's market -- the kind sell-side research traditionally served -- shifted to big-cap, dividend, share-buyback or defensive plays as the year unfolded. U.S. stock markets profited from investors globally seeking yield, but as Brian Hodess, who runs Bank of America Merrill Lynch's U.S. research effort, says, more than half of fund managers still believe the market is overvalued. A complex set of macroeconomic factors forced sell-side researchers to collaborate. "Brexit, the ECB, the Fed, the Bank of Japan, China -- all have played into an approach of mixing macro research and stock research," says Vinayak Singh, a member of Evercore ISI's executive, management and investment committee. "That requires a tremendous amount of collaboration." At the very least, this kind of research throws up barriers of entry to smaller research shops lacking scale, reach and financial resources. Evercore's Singh talks about talent migration to the bigger firms and consolidation of the sell side. The evidence for that may be in the greater concentration of ranked analysts among the top-ten firms. As it has since 1975, the question of who will pay for sell-side research looms. In Europe, a much-discussed regulatory policy known as Markets in Financial Instruments Directives II (MIFID II) mandates that research be unbundled from commissions, among many other changes, looks like it will finally be implemented on January 2018. U.S. research is not immune. The major firms have European clients and clients that do business on the Continent. The effect? There's some debate about that, but clearly true unbundling will encourage firms to support individual analysts over entire groups, or some firms over others. "If you're in a middle tier, and you don't have products of excellence, you could lose sales," says David Adelman, the director of Morgan Stanley's Americas equity research group. That's slowly occurring anyway in the U.S., he adds, "as clients concentrate their research vote." The 2016 All-America Research Team survey results reflect the opinions of some 3,835 individuals at 1,090 firms, including more than 90 of the 100 biggest U.S. equity managers. Our respondents manage an estimated $11.57 trillion in U.S. equities. For full ranking results, analysis and methodology, visit www.institutionalinvestor.com/aart.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 07, 2016 3:38pm   Comments Share: Related DKS Retail Earnings On The Docket: All The Important Dates You Need To Know Watch These 5 Huge Put Purchases In Monday Trade Fed's Yellen, Salesforce, Cisco, Retailers Lead Investing Action Plan (Investor's Business Daily) Following its meeting with the management of Dicks Sporting Goods Inc (NYSE: DKS), JPMorgan said it already believes the company is getting a significant lift from The Sports Authority (TSA)'s demise. The firm also noted that management expects the benefits to accelerate into the fourth quarter and 2017, as the company leverages purchased intellectual property. Analyst Christopher Horvers said his comp forecasts for the third quarter of 3 percent and fourth quarter of 5.2 percent are ahead of the Street. The third quarter upside, according to the analyst, comes from TSA's liquidation in the second quarter and the Olympics lift. Meanwhile, the combination of weather comparisons and targeted TSA share strategies would boost the fourth quarter. Related Link: The Curious Case Of Bass Pro Shops' Sale JPMorgan also said it did not come off the management meeting doubting that the company's estimate of 25-30 basis point margin benefit from in-sourcing e-commerce operations in 2017 is achievable. The Neutral rating on the shares of the company is due to the fact that the market expectations of the TSA lift is more than that of the firm's. That said, the firm sees a high penetration of tactical investors positioned for the double benefit of TSA's demise and lapping the warmest winter weather in 120 years in the fourth quarter to the first quarter. The firm has a December-2017 price target of $60, unchanged from the December-2016 price target. At time of writing, shares of Dick's were down 0.57 percent at $57.79.

"My slogan: Make America fun again," Dimon told a convention of finance professionals in Washington Friday. The slogan, a riff on the Republican presidential candidate's tagline, is for a presidential run that Dimon said he would like to launch but will not. "I would love to be president," Dimon said, but it won't happen because he doesn't have the necessary political experience and couldn't withstand the process. "We torture those people," he said.

Dimon criticized what he called the "incoherent" economic policy of the U.S. in recent years. "We have failed to collaborate," he said, citing specifically Congress' failure to pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the version of comprehensive immigration reform that cleared the Senate in 2013 or long-term fiscal reform. The next president, he said, should "drop the rhetoric" pitting Democrats and Republicans and work on those issues, restoring the public's faith in experts at the same time.

"Brexit makes the chance of the euro zone not surviving 10 years from now five times higher," Dimon said at the Institute of International Finance's 2016 annual membership meeting in Washington. Speaking at the same event, James Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, said that the big winner from Brexit would be New York because business currently carried out in London would shift there.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 07, 2016 1:30pm   Comments Share: Related MACK 18 Stocks Moving In Friday's Pre-Market Session The Market In 5 Minutes: Retail Earnings Come Into Focus JPMorgan has downgraded Merrimack Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ: MACK) to Neutral from Overweight and cut the price target to $7 from $8, citing the belief that shares would be range bound in the near to intermediate term amid the company's ongoing strategic review. Earlier this week, Merrimack announced the exit of CEO Robert Mulroy. The company also cut 22 percent of its workforce to save more than $200 million in expected costs over the next two years. Related Link: Merrimack Pharmaceuticals Falls Back To Support Following JPMorgan Downgrade Following are the four reasons behind JPMorgan's downgrade: "Our view that 2016 consensus estimates, while achievable, are perhaps not meaningfully beatable (and 2017 needs to moderate incrementally, in our view)." "Key pipeline catalysts, while underappreciated, are weighted 2Q17+." "Our expectation that R&D prioritization and search for a new CEO could take time (currently no timelines outlined)." "A continued financing overhang (~12 months of cash)." Analyst Anupam Rama believes the current 2016 Onivyde estimate of about $60 million (JPMorgan estimate: $57.2 million) is achievable but perhaps not meaningfully beatable. Looking ahead to 2017, the analyst believes consensus estimates will likely need to come down incrementally (consensus: $108 million; JPMorgan estimate: about $96 million). Rama cut his FY16–18 GAAP EPS estimates to ($1.19), ($0.41), and $0.08, respectively, from ($1.18), ($0.74), and ($0.26). At last check, Merrimack was down 7.32 percent at $5.54.

China’s surge in home prices reminds JPMorgan Asset Management’s chief Asia market strategist of last year’s stock-market mania. Spiraling leverage and implicit state support are among the common denominators, he said. Shanghai property values jumped 31 percent in August from a year earlier, the latest data showed. Last year, a 60 percent rally in the city’s equities through June 12 was followed by a US$5 trillion rout. Deutsche Bank Group AG warned last month that China’s housing market is in a bubble, while Goldman Sachs Group AG said this week it sees growing risks across the real-estate industry. Home prices started to take off last year in the wake of the stock-market crash after local governments eased curbs on property purchases. In recent days, cities, including Shenzhen, have started reimposing the restrictions. “It’s similar to the equity market where if you let things loose, it just runs like a stallion, and then you have to really rein it back, then it’s like an ice bucket challenge,” Hui said. “So you go through this extreme heat and cold. That’s not particularly good for the economy because then you’re going through very aggressive investment cycles.” At stake is the government’s ability to channel funds trapped by capital controls into investments that can boost the economy without creating asset bubbles. Speculative buying of commodity futures earlier this year fueled a boom that quickly unraveled, while a botched intervention to halt plummeting equities dented the credibility of policymakers and roiled global markets. Just as the surge in stocks in the first half of last year enervated financial services and provided a fillip to an ailing economy, rampant demand for property is boosting the outlook for commodities and lifting the earnings outlook for construction-related firms. Profits of industrial companies jumped the most in three years in August, while factory output, investment and retail sales also beat analysts’ estimates. Medium and long-term new loans, mostly mortgages, totaled 529 billion yuan (US$79 billion) in August, while aggregate financing jumped to 1.47 trillion yuan, helping fuel a 39 percent jump in property sales by value in the first eight months. Meanwhile, private investment in fixed assets stalled at 2.1 percent for a second straight month in August, matching a record low. Just like last year’s equity boom, China is using credit growth to boost the economy, Deutsche Bank chief China economist Zhang Zhiwei (張智威) wrote in a report on Wednesday last week. However, there are signs policymakers are acting to restrain growth in debt. The People’s Bank of China has kept its benchmark lending and deposit rates on hold for nearly a year and banks’ reserve ratios remain unchanged since February, failing to deliver the additional cuts private economists had forecast in earlier surveys. The central bank has also used longer-term tenors in the open market to drive up funding costs in a bid to rein in leverage. Still, any winding down of debt brings its own risks. “We saw the stock market tumble in 2015 from June throughout the second half, triggered by the unwinding of leverage after margin lending reached record highs,” JPMorgan Chase & Co vice chairman of Asia-Pacific Jing Ulrich (李晶) said. “Today, an alarming sign is that leverage is also building in the property market.” 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1194 times.

Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now Frisco has the Dallas Cowboys and more shopping per capita than anyplace else in Texas. What else could a town ask for? Well, how about hotels, because a lot are on the way. Three hotels are under construction in Frisco, and several more are in the works. "Frisco currently has 2,007 hotel rooms; however, based on the number of current hotels under construction, hotels that have been announced and hotels that are in the pipeline, Frisco's hotel room inventory by the end of 2018 is anticipated to explode to 4,396 hotel rooms," said Jim Gandy, head of the Frisco Economic Development Corp. "That would be an increase of 2,389 hotel rooms, or an increase of 119 percent." That's more new hotel rooms than any other area of North Texas -- even downtown Dallas. Frisco is fastest-growing city in U.S., but how close is McKinney to the top spot? With 9 million square feet of shopping, the Star in Frisco and big corporate employers next door in Plano, including Toyota, Liberty Mutual Insurance and JPMorgan Chase, Frisco hotel builders are betting that the area needs more rooms. The largest of Frisco's hotel projects has a great view of the Dallas Cowboys' The Star complex on the Dallas North Tollway. The 301-room Omni Frisco Hotel will open next summer next to The Star, the Cowboys' practice facilities and corporate headquarters. The 16-story high-rise is the tallest building so far in Frisco and includes 24,000 square feet of meeting space. Just east of the Omni on Gaylord Parkway, Missouri-based developer Drury Southwest is building a 10-story, 189-room hotel. Drury is also about to start a hotel at Richardson's huge CityLine project. "We are always looking for a great site, convenience of our customers and adjacent to market attractions," said Drury Southwest spokesman Herb Wedemeier. "Frisco definitely has that." Drury senior vice president Kevin Whitfield said the Frisco hotel is scheduled to open in June. "We are working on the sixth floor right now," he said. "It will be a mix of standard and suite rooms. "The hotel will have meeting space of about 3,500 square feet, and it will have an indoor pool on the top floor of the building." Stephen Jones on how Cowboys 'supersized' The Star and future real estate targets The third Frisco hotel under construction is a 110-unit Hotel Indigo on Gaylord Parkway. "We're across the street from the convention center and the Dr Pepper Ballpark," said Danny Patel of developer Dabu Hotels. "We are pushing to try and get it done before next summer. "Frisco provides a unique experience for guests -- both corporate and leisure," Patel said. Hotel Indigo will have suites and rooms, an outdoor pool, a restaurant, a bar and fitness facilities. Patel said construction of the nearby Dallas Cowboys complex is "icing on the cake" for the Frisco hotel market. "We are proud to be a part of that booming city." Marla Roe, executive director of the Frisco Convention and Visitors Bureau, said the timing for the hotels is good, with thousands of jobs on the way in Frisco and West Plano. "We are thrilled with the growth of hotels in Frisco, especially in light of the huge boom that is occurring in new corporations moving into the area," Roe said. "Having the ability to have a wide variety of price points and new hotels allows us to accommodate more visitors -- sports, leisure and business travel -- in Frisco, which then increases the amount of economic impact directly into the Frisco economy." Asian population growth brings new specialty retail center to Frisco Frisco draws more than 5 million visitors a year, according to the economic development corporation. Conference and group meetings add more than $70 million a year to the city's economy. Roe said construction of the Omni and plans for a 295-room Hyatt Regency at Stonebriar Centre mall will pull in more business. "Both of these projects have outstanding locations," she said. "In addition, they have meeting space that will allow us to bring not only more meetings but new meetings from groups that are loyal to the Omni and Hyatt brands." Travelers will have a lot of choices if developers make good on their plans in Frisco. Lewisville-based hotel firm NewcrestImage is planning a four-brand hotel project with 600 rooms north of the Cowboys' complex in the $1 billion Frisco Station development. The hotel complex will include a Marriott AC Hotel and Residence Inn, and a Canopy Hotel by Hilton and Hyatt Place Hotel. Construction will start on the first three hotels in January, and the groundbreaking for the Hyatt Place will happen later. Another major Frisco project, Wade Park, includes plans for a 250-room Langham Hotel and a 185-room Hotel ZaZa. Frisco’s office market heats up, thanks to Cowboys, tollway growth With so much construction on the horizon, some developers are waiting to see how the market shakes out. Developer Hall Group postponed its plans for a hotel in its 162-acre Hall Park office campus. The developer just broke ground for a 12-story office tower at Hall Park on the tollway. But developer Craig Hall said he's not ready to build a hotel there. "With so many hotels on the way in Frisco, we've decided to wait a bit," he said Construction continues on the 300-room  Omni Frisco Hotel, near Warren Parkway and west of the Tollway, in Frisco. Andy Jacobsohn/Staff Photographer Construction continues on the 189-room Drury Hotel, on the southeast corner of Gaylord Parkway and the Dallas North Tollway.

Related Content TIAA puts all real estate under one unit, splits relaunched core property fund into sectors Cincinnati Retirement System commits $50 million to open-end infrastructure fund Hawaii sets $40 million for open-end real estate fund ICI: Worldwide open-end fund assets fall 5.6% in third quarter Bristol County Retirement seeking open-end real estate manager A potent mixture of public market declines and investor sophistication is starting to eat away at open-end real estate fund managers' lunches. Net inflows into open-end real estate funds dropped 25% to $8 billion in the second quarter from the $10 billion in each of the prior two quarters, said the Investment Company Institute's second quarter report — its most recent. While inflows are up from the second quarter of 2015, net inflows had dropped 16.6% in the third quarter of last year. What's more, open-end fund managers are seeing their first exit queues — despite the net inflows — since 2010. This is a big change for open-end funds that were the post-crisis darlings when investors tilted their portfolios toward core real estate and lined up to invest. Redemptions and distributions of funds in the Open End Diversified Core Equity index rose in the second quarter to $12.8 billion, offset by $18.3 billion in contributions on a four-quarter rolling basis, according to data from the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries, Chicago. Redemptions and distributions were up 26% from $10.1 billion in the first quarter and up 80% from $7.1 billion in the second quarter of 2015. “We're in a position where the large majority of funds don't have large incoming queues and many don't have incoming queues at all, and some funds are beginning to form redemption queues to get out,” said Peter Rogers, a Chicago-based senior investment consultant and head of Americas real estate research for consulting firm Willis Towers Watson PLC, Chicago. “We're eagerly awaiting the third-quarter redemption numbers to see if indeed rebalancing or redemptions continue, indicating a bigger shift.” Managers of open-end funds say some of their investors are moving capital out of their funds to rebalance their overall portfolios as falling public markets push real estate allocations near or over their targets. “We did see some rebalancing in the first half of 2016,” said Joseph K. Azelby, managing director and CEO, global real assets in the New York office of J.P. Morgan Asset Management (JPM). This resulted in outflows from some of JPMAM's open-end funds, but JPMAM executives declined to reveal the exact amount of open-end fund inflows and outflows. Sources with knowledge of the situation said that in the third quarter J.P. Morgan's $30.6 billion core open-end fund had an exit queue of close to $300 million — but also an entry queue of about $600 million. J.P. Morgan's $3.5 billion value-add open-end fund has no exit queue and an entry queue of about $100 million, the sources said. “We continue to see solid inflows,” Mr. Azelby said. “We see everything from the traditional pension funds still adding to their core real estate allocations and we still see investors relatively new to the real estate space coming into our (open-end) real estate funds.” Willis Towers Watson's Mr. Rogers agreed that some of the redemptions are due to rebalancing, but he is keeping an eye on the trend. Investors seek more control The redemption issue comes at a time when investors are seeking more control over their real estate portfolios, a move that is at odds with diversified open-end funds. In September, TH Real Estate, the new name for the real estate business of TIAA Global Asset Management, transformed its $2 billion U.S. diversified open-end fund into five open-end funds; a diversified open-end fund and four sector-focused sleeves. TH Real Estate last year launched a set of sector-focused real estate funds in Europe and is considering a similar set for the Asia-Pacific region, said Randy Giraldo, managing director of the U.S. focused open-end funds. “We heard from existing clients and clients from other products that they are seeking more sector-specific strategies and are moving away from generalist strategies,” Mr. Giraldo said. Investors can invest in the diversified fund or choose the investment mix by using the sector-specific sleeves. A decade ago there were fewer ways for asset owners to invest in direct real estate. But “since the financial crisis the pendulum has swung sharply from open-end to co-investment and separate accounts,” he said. At the same time, institutional investors have become more sophisticated. Some are adding staff, while offshore investors are moving from passive investments to joint ventures and establishing their own real estate management offices, Mr. Giraldo said. “This is the result of the slow movement to add sophistication. We wanted to capture that trend by giving investors the ability to allocate across property types as they see fit.” What's more, several real estate and private equity managers have launched value-added and core-plus open-end funds, which once just boasted mostly core funds. J.P. Morgan, Carlyle Group and Blackstone Group all have non-core open-end funds. Question of liquidity The suspension of trading by seven U.K. retail open-end real estate managers after the Brexit vote, due to lines of investors trying to get out, was a reminder that open-end funds are not always liquid. A number of managers were forced to block redemptions while they sold properties to give investors their money back, noted Jason Yablon, a New York-based senior vice president and global portfolio manager with Cohen & Steers Inc. This is a lesson that institutional investors also learned in the financial crisis, when many open-end funds established redemption gates to avoid selling properties at one of the lowest points of the real estate market, he said. Cohen & Steers offers open-end real estate investment trust funds but does not offer open-end funds that own properties directly, Mr. Yablon said. “There is a liquidity mismatch with trying to offer daily liquidity when you own illiquid, direct real estate assets that by their nature don't trade daily.” Open-end fund “liquidity is never a problem until it's a problem,” quipped Mark Grinis, global real estate private equity leader in the New York office of consulting firm Ernst & Young. “Look at 2008. Look at Brexit. Pick your event. You can't run for the exits at the same time,” he said. “Typically people run to the exit at the same time.” NCREIF data show the impact of a run for the doors can last for a long time. As a result of the financial crisis, redemptions and distributions outpaced contributions of the ODCE funds on a four-quarter rolling basis for two years — ending in the third quarter of 2010. U.K. open-end funds are still feeling the impact of Brexit, including continued redemptions, Mr. Grinis said. Still, the open-end fund universe has grown substantially in the past seven years, Mr. Rogers noted. The number of funds in the NCREIF ODCE index has grown to 24 from 14 in 2009, a nearly 72% increase, he said. But not all investors favor open-end funds. The real estate portfolio of the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board, Santa Fe, is a combination of REITs and real estate invested in closed-end funds, said Bob Jacksha, chief investment officer of the $11.7 billion pension fund. So far, New Mexico Educational officials have stayed away from open-end funds due to the queues to get in, Mr. Jacksha said. “Also, the large diversified funds tend to be invested in core assets,” he said.  “In our view, core assets are and have been expensive for some time. ... While core assets are traditionally viewed as high quality and thus relatively "safe,' we question that orthodoxy if they are overpriced.” New Mexico Educational has 7.3% of total fund assets invested in real estate, somewhat over its 7% target allocation, Mr. Jacksha said. Earlier this year, pension officials sold some REITs to rebalance. n This article originally appeared in the October 3, 2016 print issue as, "Redemptions, investor shifts put pinch on open-end funds".

Brexodus! Citi to move 900 staff to Dublin (Seeking Alpha) Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) bought $26.6 million worth of his own company's stock, and the timing couldn't have been better. According to Bloomberg, JPMorgan's stock bottomed on that day and has since returned more than 25 percent. The 500,000 shares Dimon bought are now worth north $33 million; the stock is trading near the highest level it has seen in a year. JPMorgan's stock hit a 52-week high of $69.03 in November, and shares were trading at around $67.50 early Thursday morning. Dimon bought shares of the company he runs because he believed it was cheap and was hard hit amid a worldwide decline in stocks that plagued the first few months of the year. Related Link: JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Bought $26 Million Of Company's Stock The New York Times said in February that Dimon's purchase may serve as a "recognition" that shares of financial companies have become "relatively cheap." The publication's assessment wasn't entire accurately, as Dimon's purchase helped boost the stock higher by 8 percent and haven't looked back since. However, many of JPMorgan's international banking peers have failed to offer investors a similar return. Bloomberg noted that Citigroup Inc (NYSE: C), Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC), Credit Suisse Group AG (ADR) (NYSE: CS) and Deutsche Bank AG (USA) (NYSE: DB) were "also struggling at the time," but "not all of them have seen the same type of comeback."

Download the Scutify iOS App, the Scutify Android App or visit Scutify.com. The Wall Street Journal had an amusing article a few days ago in which analysts bumped up GDP forecasts for numerous reasons including inventories, exports in general, and soybeans in particular. Let's investigate the claims. Please consider Soybeans Are Fueling U.S. Economic Growth (But Not for Long). U.S. agricultural exports have surged the past two months, helping cut the trade deficit and boosting the outlook for short-term economic growth. One big factor? Soybeans. Bumper harvests at home, crop shortfalls in South America and solid demand-especially from China-have propelled international feed sales. "Soybean exports will add about 1% to [third-quarter] GDP growth," Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said in a note to clients. Mr. Shepherdson is forecasting 4% annualized growth in third-quarter gross domestic product, a broad measure of economic output. That's a big improvement from 1.4% GDP growth in the second quarter and 0.8% in the first. But it does little to alter the longer-term outlook. First, exports are likely to return to trend while depleted crop inventories would be a drag on GDP. Second, the economy has averaged a modest 2.1% growth rate over the course of the expansion, a trajectory that seems unlikely to change despite some noise from quarter to quarter. "The soybean boost is indeed a one-time thing. It has no implications for trend growth and likely will reverse over the next couple quarters," Mr. Shepherdson said. Shifting Outlook Following the commerce department international trade report on September 29, other analysts bumped up their forecasts as well. J.P. Morgan Chase revised its outlook to 3% annualized growth in the third quarter, up from its earlier estimate of 2%. Amherst Pierpont Securities boosted its forecast to 3.7% from 3.5%. Macroeconomic Advisers raised its tracking forecast by three-tenths to 3.1%. Barclays inched up to 2.6% from 2.4%. Is JPMorgan reading Shepherdson? The other way around? Regardless, Shepherdson's forecast got me curious about a number of things, namely soybeans and the trade deficit. Trade Deficit Shrinks More Than Exected In Trade Deficit Shrinks a Bit More Than Expected: Impact on GDP Estimates? I took a stab at the impact. Impact on GDP? The impact on tomorrow's Atlanta Fed GDPNow estimate and the FRBNY Nowcast estimate for 3rd quarter GDP is guesswork two ways. First, I do not know what their model predicted. Second I do not know how their model will react even if I did know what it predicted. Thus, this seemingly good result might not turn out that way if the models predicted even better results. Nonetheless, I am willing to take a stab: The impact from this report will be small, but slightly positive on third quarter GDP estimates (+0.05 to +0.10) percentage points. GDPNow Impact I was on the low side. A check of the GDPNow Model Data (shows the net effect ofall exports went from -0.13 to +0.13 between September 28 and September 30. The deficit shrinkage will add something like 0.26 percentage points to third quarter GDP. Soybeans are only a tiny portion of exports. Balance of Trade Balance of trade chart from Census Bureau. That chart is through August. Is another stellar month coming up in September? Based on soybeans? Price of Soybeans At $9.63 per bushel, the price of soybeans is up from a year ago, but down substantially from second quarter. It's not clear why soybeans will add anything to third quarter GDP. Are exports soaring? USDA Soybean Statistics Let's investigate USDA Soybean Statistics as of September 2016. *Crop Year: September 1 through August 31 If we assume soybean exports will rise by 100 million bushels from the previous year, and apply all of it to third quarter GDP, at a price of $9.63, soybean exports would add $963 million to GDP. The entire production increase from last year is only $2.8 billion. From first to second quarter, Real GDP went from $16,525 billion to $16,583 billion, an increase of $58 billion (seasonally adjusted annualized). Factor GDP by quarters if you like, but also factor soybeans exports by quarters as well. Soybean Exports Chart from Allendale Weekly Export Sales report on 8-11-2016. In the Allendale Weekly Export Sales report on 9-22-2016 (for the period September 8-15) we find this blurb. US: Soybean export sales totaled 875,724 metric tonnes (all 2016/17, no 2017/18). This was under the 900,000 - 1,200,000 trade expectation. USDA's whole-year goal comes to 1.985 billion bushels, a new record. That would be 2% over last year and 22% over the five year average. Amusingly, corn seems better. US: Weekly export sales for the period from September 8 - 15 were released this morning. Corn export sales totaled 921,903 metric tonnes (all 2016/17, no 2017/18). This was just over the 700,000 - 900,000 trade estimate. USDA's goal for the year, at 2.175 billion bushels, would be a record. It would be 14% over last year and 36% over the five year average. With only two full weeks figured of the new crop year done, our total sales come to 707 million bushels, 84% over last year and 43% over the five year average. Due to good pre-September sales, we are ahead of the pace needed. In September, only the incremental export increase (if any) from August will add to 3rd quarter GDP. We had a huge jump from July to August, is another huge jump coming? A reversal actually seems more likely. Regardless, the notion that soybeans or corn exports (corn at $3.48) will add 1% to 3rd quarter GDP is ridiculous.

The 45th anniversary of the annual ranking of Wall Street's top equity analysts begs the question: Why does the buy side still buy sell-side research? Since May Day 1975, when 180 years of fixed brokerage commissions ended on Wall Street, prognosticators have insisted that sell-side equity research's days were numbered, and doom-and-gloomers saw the relationship between sell-side research and buy-side investing as imperiled. And yet year after year, the sell side has proven surprisingly resilient. Nicholas Rosato, head of North American Research for JPMorgan, argues that for all the fears and fluctuations, what has not changed over the decades is the mutually beneficial relationship with the buy side. "The buy side continues to need and value sell-side research," Rosato affirms. Institutional Investor launched the All-America Research Team ranking in 1972, three years before May Day. The ranking's longevity is evidence of the ability of sell-side research to evolve, adjust and change. "The Institutional Investor All-America Research poll continues to set the standard to identify excellence within the Investment Research ecosystem," says Will Rowlands-Rees, Managing Director of II Research. "This year we saw voters in particular really focus on the Economics/Strategy sectors, with a material increase in overall voting. With an uncertain global macro environment, this doesn't surprise. It just reinforces the continued importance of this process to provide actionable product feedback between Buy and Sell side," he adds. The team is the buy side's judgment on the performance of its outsourced providers of investment analysis; it's an election, not a stock-picking contest. And this year's election has a new victor. JPMorgan had held top honors for five consecutive years, until Bank of America Merrill Lynch edged ahead of it last year. This year, JPMorgan regains its crown with 40 analysts voted on the team -- an improvement of four over 2015 -- beating out BofA Merrill, which saw its total fall by six, to 32. Rounding out this year's top ten firms: 1. J.P. Morgan 2. Bank of America Merrill Lynch 3. Evercore ISI 4. UBS 5. Morgan Stanley 6. Barclays 7. Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. 8. Deutsche Bank Securities 9. RBC Capital Markets 10. Citi In all, this year's team includes 322 analysts from 30 firms. To see the full team, including all ranked firms and analysts, visit www.institutionalinvestor.com/aart. Among the investment trends uncovered by this year's results: In a topsy-turvy year, investors turned to top firms. Eight out of the top ten firms saw their numbers rise, notably Evercore ISI, from 25 to 30, and UBS, from 22 to 28. That was not the case in 2015, but it may suggest that in a topsy-turvy year, investors turned to the top firms, which tend to be larger and more diversified. When it's quality over quantity, JPMorgan is king. The weighted average paints a different picture than the overall leaderboard. This measure gives greater credence to getting higher-ranked analysts voted onto the team. JPMorgan runs away with the weighted average, as it has for a number of years, in which a rating of four is assigned to each first-place position, three to each second-place spot, and so on. The bank racks up 109 points to the No. 2 shop, Evercore ISI, with 79. BofA Merrill slides to fourth this year, with a weighted average of 59. A volatile year led to movement in the ranks by weighted average. Evercore ISI rises from No. 3 in 2015 to No. 2, while UBS hops three spots from No. 6 to No. 3. On weighted average, however, four firms -- UBS, BofA Merrill, Bernstein and Morgan Stanley, both based in New York -- come out neck and neck, with only five points separating No. 3, UBS, and No. 5, Morgan Stanley. Many of the favorite stocks of 2015 fell from favor in 2016. This year's market was one in which much of the gains were coming from a narrowing universe of stocks. An active, value-oriented stock-picker's market -- the kind sell-side research traditionally served -- shifted to big-cap, dividend, share-buyback or defensive plays as the year unfolded. U.S. stock markets profited from investors globally seeking yield, but as Brian Hodess, who runs Bank of America Merrill Lynch's U.S. research effort, says, more than half of fund managers still believe the market is overvalued. A complex set of macroeconomic factors forced sell-side researchers to collaborate. "Brexit, the ECB, the Fed, the Bank of Japan, China -- all have played into an approach of mixing macro research and stock research," says Vinayak Singh, a member of Evercore ISI's executive, management and investment committee. "That requires a tremendous amount of collaboration." At the very least, this kind of research throws up barriers of entry to smaller research shops lacking scale, reach and financial resources. Evercore's Singh talks about talent migration to the bigger firms and consolidation of the sell side. The evidence for that may be in the greater concentration of ranked analysts among the top-ten firms. As it has since 1975, the question of who will pay for sell-side research looms. In Europe, a much-discussed regulatory policy known as Markets in Financial Instruments Directives II (MIFID II) mandates that research be unbundled from commissions, among many other changes, looks like it will finally be implemented on January 2018. U.S. research is not immune. The major firms have European clients and clients that do business on the Continent. The effect? There's some debate about that, but clearly true unbundling will encourage firms to support individual analysts over entire groups, or some firms over others. "If you're in a middle tier, and you don't have products of excellence, you could lose sales," says David Adelman, the director of Morgan Stanley's Americas equity research group. That's slowly occurring anyway in the U.S., he adds, "as clients concentrate their research vote." The 2016 All-America Research Team survey results reflect the opinions of some 3,835 individuals at 1,090 firms, including more than 90 of the 100 biggest U.S. equity managers. Our respondents manage an estimated $11.57 trillion in U.S. equities. For full ranking results, analysis and methodology, visit www.institutionalinvestor.com/aart.

"Given the elections, that will obviously take a lot of the headlines in the next few weeks. … The election will put a lot of volatility in the market," said Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer, equities, at Charles Schwab Investment Management. Right at the start to the week, traders will watch Sunday night's presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This second debate between the two candidates is scheduled for 9 p.m., ET, at Washington University in St. Louis and will take the form of a town meeting. show chapters <p>Here&#039;s how the market will move after the election: JPM Strategist</p> <p>JPM strategist Nadia Lovell joins CNBC&#039;s Jackie DeAngelis to discuss how market will move after the election.</p> Here's how the market will move after the election: JPM Strategist    Thursday, 6 Oct 2016 | 3:15 PM ET | 02:01 "I don't believe a Clinton win is completely priced into the markets," said Brian Muench, vice president of investment management at Allianz Investment Management. He expects a pullback in stocks by the end of the year, and polls showing a tighter race between the two candidates could contribute to the decline. The potential number of market-moving events only heats up as the week progresses. Earnings season unofficially kicks off Tuesday with Alcoa's quarterly results, and the meeting minutes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's September meeting are due Wednesday. New York Fed President Bill Dudley is also scheduled to speak that day. The climax comes Friday with earnings from major banks Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. "For me, the real driver for markets the end of this year should really be third-quarter earnings," said Chris Wright, ultra high net worth investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management. "We'd be looking for quite strong earnings growth in the third quarter given we've got a fairly benign third quarter." Retail sales are due for release on the same day, and Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to speak that afternoon on "Macroeconomic research after the crisis." "We'll be watching consumer data next week just to confirm we think the consumer is in a good position here," said Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. "Earnings and the retail sales and any Fed speakers will be closely watched as to how they digest (Friday's jobs) release," he said. The September nonfarm payrolls report showed creation of 156,000 for the month, below expectations, while the unemployment rate ticked up to 5 percent. Average hourly wages rose 6 cents to an annualized rate of 2.6 percent. U.S. stocks closed slightly lower Friday after the jobs report and snapped a three-week win streak. The S&P 500 ended the week at 2,153.74, weighed by a 5.3 percent decline in the REITs sector. "While we're still two jobs reports away from the Fed meeting, there probably could have been some political implications for this," said David Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Global Asset Management. But the data "wasn't strong enough to crow about if you're a Democrat, and it wasn't weak enough to bad mouth if you're a Republican. It won't have a lot of effect on Fed expectations." The data reduced already low expectations for a November rate hike and added to general expectations the Fed will raise rates in December. The U.S. dollar index rose 1.1 percent for the week amid increased anticipation of a rate hike later this year and the plunge in the pound. Gold futures for December delivery fell nearly 5 percent for its worst week in three years and settled Friday at $1,251.90 an ounce. Treasury yields were lower after the jobs report, with the U.S. two-year Treasury note yield around 0.83 percent and the 10-year yield near 1.72 percent. Bond markets are closed Monday for Columbus Day. "Yields have spent the month of October moving upward [on] fears of payrolls, the Fed, the European Central Bank," said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist, Prudential Fixed Income. "One by one, the various concerns are getting aired." U.S. crude oil futures will also be in focus next week on whether oil can hold recent gains. Crude topped the psychologically key $50 level this week before ending the week at $49.81 a barrel after Baker Hughes data showed U.S. drillers added rigs in 14 of the past 15 weeks. Meanwhile, investors will keep a close eye for news on a settlement between Deutsche Bank and the U.S. Department of Justice. Traders will also watch British pound sterling after it plunged to fresh 31-year lows against the U.S. dollar. The decline came amid comments from European leaders that indicated a stricter than anticipated break between the U.K. and the European Union would come with an official trigger of Brexit.

Stumpf, fighting to keep his job amid a national political furor, will forgo more than $41 million of stock and salary as the banks board investigates how employees opened legions of bogus accounts for customers. (Photo by Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg) It’s long been common to hear about private companies that are accused of wrongdoing by officials and paying fine to settle a lawsuit — but aren’t required to admit any guilt, even when it is painfully obvious they are. In this post, educator Larry Cuban explains why “[i]mmunity from accountability is currently widespread in the private sector, but not in the public sector.” Cuban was a high school social studies teacher for 14 years, a district superintendent (seven years in Arlington, VA), and is professor emeritus of education at Stanford University, where he has taught for more than two decades. He is the author of numerous books, including “Inside the Black Box of Classroom Practice: Change without Reform in American Education.” This appeared on his blog in two parts (here and here) and he gave me permission to publish.   By Larry Cuban Wells Fargo, a bank that made more than $80 billion in revenue  and has a market value of $277 billion, was fined $185 million by federal regulators for creating 1.5 million fake credit card accounts. In the plea bargain that regulators made with bank officials, Wells Fargo admitted no responsibility for the financial misconduct. The company had fired more than 5,000 of its lowest-paid employees, but neither the senior vice president for community banking — where the fraud occurred — nor the CEO have lost their positions. CEO John Stumpf, who was named in 2013 as Morningstar’s CEO of the Year and earns about $20 million a year, did face U.S. Senate Banking Committee questions about the phony accounts last week. In testimony, he said, “I take full responsibility for all of the unethical practices in our retail banking business.” But Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), a member of the Banking Committee, said what the bank did was a “scam” and that Stumpf “should resign” and “be criminally investigated.” Looking back at the fallout from the Great Recession of 2008 in lost billions of investors’ dollars, millions of home foreclosures, and crushed hopes of a generation of hard-working American retirees — apart from one senior trader at Credit Suisse who was convicted and served 30 months — not one single CEO of an investment house, bank or insurance company hip-deep in deceiving and defrauding Americans was indicted or served a day in jail. Yes, federal regulators fined other banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America billions of dollars but they, like Wells Fargo, admitted no unlawful conduct and took no responsibility for their actions (see here, here, here, and here). Contrast that with the savings-and-loan bank failure in the 1980s when over 1,000 bankers  went to jail for fraud and similar charges. That was then, this is now. Immunity from accountability is currently widespread in the private sector, but not in the public sector. Take the case of the Atlanta Public Schools and the cheating scandal between 2009-2015. Then district superintendent Beverly Hall led the district between 1999 and 2010. In 2009, she was named Superintendent of the Year by the American Association of School Administrators. But in 2011, states officials investigated after  the Atlanta Journal-Constitution published revelations that nearly 180 teachers and officials in 44 schools raised students’ test scores, and Hall  and 31 teachers and administrators were indicted and stood trial.  Most of these educators took plea deals; Hall died of breast cancer during the trial. Eleven educators accused of tampering with students’ test scores were convicted in 2015 and are now serving from one to seven years in Georgia prisons. No immunity from accountability here. Lawyers and historians say often that before rushing to judgment, one must become familiar with the circumstances, the organizational setting and the mind-set of those who committed the crimes. So what were the contexts for Wells Fargo’s fraud and Atlanta’s cheating scandals? Wells Fargo Beginning as early as 2009, individual employees, many of whom earned less than $15 an hour, were expected to sell Wells Fargo products (e.g., credit cards, over-draft protection, checking and  savings accounts) to existing customers in order to meet their monthly goals. If they  fell short, sales representatives were written up, reprimanded or let go. Managers put intense pressure on their employees to meet these targets. Rita Murillo, a bank manager who left the company said: “We were constantly told we would end up working for McDonald’s. If we did not make the sales quotas … we had to stay for what felt like after-school detention, or report to a call session on Saturdays.” Wells Fargo quarterly profits continued to climb in the years following the Great Recession. Investors were pleased. As the years passed, word of bogus credit cards, checking and savings accounts and angry customers leaked out. The Los Angeles Times published an expose of the practices in 2013. The intense race to meet monthly goals created a culture where sales staff were pushed again and again to meet their targets or else. Phone calls from bosses were dreaded. After newspaper articles appeared, managers fired employees. Even after the Times‘ revealing of these practices and the dog-eat-dog ethos at Wells Fargo, bogus credit cards and new accounts continued.  Then state and federal regulators entered the picture. Fines were levied against Wells Fargo but not one senior executive was either admonished or forced to resign. This is the context for Wells Fargo (see here, here, and here). The Atlanta Public Schools The high-poverty, mostly black district had struggled for decades with low graduation and high dropout rates and state test scores near the bottom of Georgia’s public school systems. Within the segregated district — there are a few largely white schools and the rest are largely black — academic gaps between white and black have been large and persistent (e.g., majority white Grady High School graduates 82 percent of its students while majority black Douglass High School is 42 percent). Pressure to raise state test scores and graduation rates rose and fell as superintendents came and went in the 1990s. With the appointment of Beverly Hall in 1999 and the signing of the federal No Child Left Behind law in 2002, that pressure increased considerably. Rewards and sanctions accompanied goals of raising test scores across the district. All teachers in schools meeting 70 percent of their goal, for example, would receive bonus payments. The superintendent’s contract had a similar provision for increases to her salary. Sanctions for low test performance under NCLB led to closed schools, firing principals and reprimands for district office administrators not meeting state and federal goals under Adequate Yearly Performance. Hall was determined to improve Atlanta’s student performance, and the numbers rose over the years. Bonuses went to many schools and the superintendent. Rumors of tampering with test scores circulated and were dismissed. A number of teachers reported principals fiddling with test score results. Nothing happened except strong district office messages to be quiet or leave. A culture of fear blanketed schools. Then the Atlanta Journal Constitution investigated the rumors and published their startling report in 2009 on how much adult cheating occurred on district tests. State officials then completed their investigation in 2011 (see here). The results of that investigation led to charging the superintendent, principals and teachers in over three dozen schools with changing student test scores. The report pointed to the high-stress placed on raising test scores and the pervasive fear among school employees of retaliation if anyone reported abuses. Some quotes from the state inquiry: *“Throughout this investigation numerous teachers told us they raised concerns about cheating and other misconduct to their principal or SRT [School Reform Team] … only to end up disciplined or terminated.” *“[T] message was: ‘Get the scores up by any means necessary;’ in Dr. Hall’s words, ‘No exceptions and no excuses.’” *“In sum, a culture of fear, intimidation and retaliation permeated the APS system from the highest ranks down.” At both Wells Fargo and in the Atlanta public schools hard-driving managerial pressures created fear-strewn workplaces where success-filled data became the goal. Similar contexts in a public and private institution turned up. Yet accountability for fraud in these two institutions differed greatly. How come?   — Part 2: Wells Fargo bank and the Atlanta public schools defrauded large numbers of customers and students. At the bank, over 5,000 employees were fired. The bank’s CEO admitted responsibility for the fraud before a U.S. Senate Banking Committee yet the fine levied by federal regulators ($185 million) wasn’t even a slap on the wrist, given the $80 plus billion in revenues that the bank took in last year. Nor did the bank admit in that agreement to pay the fine any responsibility for for their actions. The CEO is still CEO. The Atlanta public schools cheating scandal found evidence of 178 principals and teachers in over 40 schools tampering with student scores on state tests. Eleven teachers were indicted, tried, and convicted (over 20 other educators took plea deals).  Those 11 are in prison. Two questions occurred to me as I read and pondered these instances of corruption Wells Fargo and the Atlanta public schools. First, why did employees scam customers with bogus bank accounts and educators tamper with test scores? The familiar answer: some bad apples caused the problem — which is basically saying it was individuals acting badly not an organizational problem. Over 5,000 fired at Wells Fargo is a lot of “bad apples, however.” Over 40 schools and 178 educators is also a lot of “bad apples.” The “bad apples” answer side-steps the pervasive culture in Wells Fargo and Atlanta public schools that top leaders shaped and drove unrelentingly. Top officials created an organizational culture of producing results at any cost. Ample evidence exists of top managers  setting very high performance goals that were difficult to meet; the company and district created fear among employees who didn’t meet those goals. Penalties for low performance and retaliation for those who complained fostered a culture of fear. Compliance to do what expected even if it disadvantaged customers was a powerful reason to keep a job. In short, the culture caused employees to peddle bogus accounts and fix test scores. But — you knew a “but” was coming —  not all of the lowest-paid employees engaged in the fraud. While cultural pressures can be strong and influential, they do not always determine individual action.  Sure, 5,300 Wells Fargo employees were fired but many more retained their jobs by figuring out ways to perform and not defraud customers. Similarly, all Atlanta  educators experienced the same intense pressure to raise students’ test scores but many principals and teachers followed the rules and did what they were supposed to do in administering and scoring tests. Yes, organizational culture surely shapes behavior but it does not determine how every individual acts. Top officials were greedy; they thought they could get away with the fraud and cheating and boost the reputation of their organizations.  Over the years, bipartisan policies deregulated industries (e.g., financial companies, airlines) creating a climate where profit seeking is highly prized. Billionaires become American heroes dispensing donations, advice, and encouragement to aspiring millionaires. The  language describing unvarnished greed has softened, euphemisms abound describing the unceasing chase for more and more money (e.g., “being entrepreneurial,” “individual enterprise”). Not only in the corporate sector, this profit-seeking culture has now spread across public institutions such as schools, hospitals, and prisons (see here, here, and here). None of this should surprise any reader since individual profit-seeking is in the DNA of a capitalist democracy. From John Jacob Astor to John D. Rockefeller to Cornelius Vanderbilt, billionaires made their money in trade and real estate, oil, and railroads. They became legends in their own time. They were admired, inspiring their fellow Americans whether they were poor, working class or just got a hand-hold in the middle class to get rich In the U.S., the job of curbing the unrelenting search for profit has been the role of government, as it has in most developed countries. We have lived in a mixed economy where both business and government have interacted constantly checking and balancing one another for nearly two centuries. When that partnership breaks down or one side becomes too powerful—too much government regulation or too much business influence on governmental policy then shifts in political power  occur to correct that imbalance. Consider the New Deal following the Great Depression  of the 1930s. Or deregulation of industries since the 1980s and reforming the tax code to benefit the wealthy. The U.S. is in such a moment now of inequalities in wealth that call for restraining the richest of the rich from re-shaping government policies to make it easier for them to become even wealthier while leaving middle class families trail far behind in increasing their salaries. Second, why are there differences in holding public and private employees accountable for their crimes? Since the late 1970s, the United States is in a moment when business success, corporate entrepreneurs, and keeping government regulation at arm’s length has dominated public policy. “Government is the problem,” as Ronald Reagan put it. Getting rid of government rules and bureaucracy, conservatives argue, will unleash business owners to invest and create more jobs for Americans. Anti-government rhetoric morphed into state and federal laws — e.g., tax cuts, incentives for investors to locate their monies in off-shore accounts and not pay taxes, low interest rates, fewer IRS audits —  that benefited those who ran companies and had large investment portfolios. Corporate leaders, backed by large sums of money, hired lobbyists to influence legislators to deregulate airlines, banks, pharmaceuticals, and other industries so that more money would flow to the already rich. To the rich, public institutions were  feeding at the tax-payer trough and were not as efficient and effective as private sector companies. Accountability was needed, business leaders said, to hold public officials in schools, hospitals, and prisons to be responsible for student outcomes, curing illnesses, and punishing criminals. And that is how I explain why no CEO of a company heavily involved in the chicanery of the Great Recession of 2008 has gotten convicted while some Atlanta school employees went to jail.           local answer-sheet Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Over the next 10 years, the Washington, D.C., suburb plans to revitalize 16 blocks in its Old Town neighborhood, unifying the waterfront with $120 million of park improvements and private-sector, mixed-use developments. Among the high-profile projects is that of Bethesda-based developer EYA, which has plans to replace two former Washington Post warehouses with a development featuring 26 townhouses, a 70-unit condo building and ground-floor retail. But many residents are opposed to the traffic, density and modern architectural styles that redevelopment will bring. The economic viability of the project is also a concern. A lack of interest from hoteliers recently scuttled developer Rooney Properties’ plans to transform the vacant Robinson Terminal North into a hotel and condo complex with 25,000 square feet of space for shops and restaurants. Maine President Barack Obama has created a new national monument in north-central Maine with 87,000 acres donated by Burt’s Bees co-founder Roxanne Quimby. The businesswoman spent two decades amassing the parcel, worth an estimated $60 million, by reinvesting the proceeds from the personal-care-product company. The wooded expanse, located to the east of Baxter State Park, offers views of Katahdin, Maine’s tallest mountain, and teems with wildlife, including moose, black bears, coyotes and bald eagles, the Associated Press reported. “Through this incredibly generous private gift for conservation, these lands will remain accessible to current and future generations of Americans, ensuring the rich history of Mainers’ hunting, fishing and recreation heritage will forever be preserved,” Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said. Legacy West Plano, Texas The prospect of walkability is drawing corporations like Toyota, FedEx, JPMorgan Chase and Liberty Mutual to Plano, a city 20 miles northeast of Dallas. Karahan Companies, the master developer of a $3 billion, 255-acre, “eat, work, play, live” community called Legacy West, is including “an open-air urban village” within its boundaries. The project, which is about 50 percent complete, will feature a 15-story hotel, a 55,000-square-foot food hall and more than 1,000 rental units and condos, as well as retail, restaurants and music venues, Urban Land Magazine reported. Public parks and trails will connect the office buildings to the 38-acre “village.” The target? Millennials who refuse to work in isolated suburban office parks. The site, owned by department store chain JCPenney, sits at the intersection of Dallas North Tollway and State Highway 121, a 20-minute drive to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. To support the project, Plano is realigning roads, improving utility connections, offering tax breaks and performing studies on mass transportation. Detroit Book Tower Developers are working to transform a run-down stretch of downtown Detroit’s Washington Boulevard into the grand passage it once was — think of it as the Motor City’s answer to thoroughfares like Fifth Avenue or the Champs-Élysées. An estimated $600 million is flowing into projects along a four-block stretch between Michigan Avenue and Grand Circus Park, funding the renovation and construction of apartment buildings, ground-floor retail, offices and housing for low-income seniors. Inspired by the successful renovation of the 33-story Westin Book Cadillac Hotel a decade ago, a handful of developers who bought buildings at rock-bottom prices during the city’s fiscal budget crisis are shelling out for painstakingly detailed historic restorations. Dan Gilbert’s Bedrock Real Estate Services plans to overhaul the 38-story Book Tower and the Book Building next door. The long-vacant skyscraper’s Italian Renaissance-style architecture, which features an aged-copper roof and “carvings of seminude female figures,” is so ornate that the budget for the three-year restoration is expected to top $400 million, Crain’s Detroit Business reported. The firm, which owns about 90 properties in the city center, bought Book Tower, Book Building and another adjoining property for an estimated $30 million. Sharon, Connecticut Celebrity couple Michael J. Fox and Tracy Pollan are trying to unload their Connecticut vacation home, trimming the asking price for the lush 72-acre estate by 12 percent, to $4.25 million, Variety reported. The property, located in the Litchfield County town of Sharon, contains a 5,000-square-foot home with six bedrooms and 4.5 baths, and features a pool and a horse barn. The retreat was custom built in 1997 for the couple, who famously fell in love on the set of the TV sitcom “Family Ties.” “It’s a fantasy, a place we go to on weekends, where everything else falls away,” Fox told Architectural Digest in 2000. At the time, the “Back to the Future” actor, who has been open about living with Parkinson’s disease, credited the architect and design team with giving him “the best therapy possible.” Marshall, Virginia A 167-acre estate that offered a brief reprieve to President John F. Kennedy and his wife, Jacqueline, as they sought privacy and proximity to Washington, D.C., has been re-listed at $5.95 million, a 46 percent discount from its 2013 price. The four-bedroom home in Marshall, Virginia, was commissioned for the couple and completed in 1963, the same year that John Kennedy was assassinated. Named Wexford by Jacqueline Kennedy, after the county in Ireland where the Kennedy clan originated, President Kennedy was able to use the vacation home only two times, according to the Washington Post. The property boasts a pool, a tennis court, a stable and an underground bomb shelter. Jacqueline Kennedy sold the property in 1964 for $225,000. Detroit Professional skateboarder and entrepreneur Tony Hawk is taking his stupefying skating tricks to the Motor City. He and his wife recently snapped up a historic redbrick multifamily building in the city’s Woodbridge section. The property, which is around 120 years old, has three units measuring 1,200 square feet each. The price was not disclosed. Hawk’s family is planning to use one of the units as a pied-à-terre and to rent the remaining units. The building was originally built as a single-family mansion and at one point was used as a hospital, the Detroit Free Press reported. Hawk’s wife is from Detroit, and the couple wanted to invest in the city, said Jim Tumey, a broker who advised on the transaction. The family, he said, “wanted to put their money and their stamp on the city.” Sure enough, after the closing, Hawk posted an Instagram photo of himself skating in Woodbridge’s skate park.

Richard Florida @Richard_Florida Oct 6, 2016 Comments Share on Facebook Tweet Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program Globalization and urbanization go hand in hand. The world, I’ve long argued, is spiky. The 40 largest mega-regions produce two-thirds of global economic output and 90 percent of global innovation, while housing just 18 percent of the world’s population. But we lack solid data on global cities. (My own work uses satellite data on the world at night, which has its own limitations.) A new report, “Redefining Global Cities,” by the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program fills an important gap here, providing detailed data on the 123 largest global cities based on their metro economies. The report, released as part of the Global Cities Initiative (a joint project of Brookings and JP Morgan Chase), develops data on economic output, productivity, globalization (via foreign direct investment), innovation (based on patents and venture capital investment), talent (population with tertiary education), and global connectivity (via measures of airline passengers and Internet connectivity). The report uses these data to create a new typology of the seven types of global cities. The first three are the world’s leading economic power centers. Global Giants: These are the world’s leading economic and financial centers, its foremost global cities. They include New York, Los Angeles, London, Paris, Tokyo, and Osaka-Kobe. Knowledge Capitals: These are world’s leading knowledge and tech hubs. They include 19 cities centers such as San Jose (the Silicon Valley), Boston, Seattle, San Diego, Washington, D.C., Chicago, Austin, Dallas, Atlanta, Portland, and Denver in the U.S. and Amsterdam, Stockholm, and Zurich in Europe. Asian Anchors: These are Asia’s five established and rising economic power centers: Hong Kong, Singapore, Seoul-Incheon, Shanghai, Beijing—and Moscow. Their ability to attract foreign direct investment makes them serious global power players despite having lower levels of economic output than the Global Giants. In addition to the global economic powerhouses, the report identifies four other types of global cities in the U.S. and around the world which occupy the middle ranks of the world economy. Some are growing in sync with globalization, others are more challenged by it. American Middleweights: These are 16 mid-sized U.S. metro areas, including places that are growing via connections to the global economy, including Miami and Rustbelt metros like Cleveland, Detroit, and Pittsburgh, which have up until now have seen their major industries challenged by global competition. International Middleweights: This group includes 26 mid-sized metros outside the U.S., including Toronto and Vancouver in Canada; Brussels, Rome, Milan, Berlin, Vienna, Madrid, and Barcelona in Europe; Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth in Australia; and Tel Aviv in the Middle East. Many of these cities are aspiring tech and knowledge hubs and serve as centers for talent, as well. Factory China: This set includes 22 second- and third-tier Chinese cities that are manufacturing powerhouses. Even though these metros have experienced rapid growth based on export-intensive manufacturing, they remain relatively poor. Emerging Gateways: These are 28 large global business and transportation gateways for major national and regional markets, including Mexico City, Sao Paolo, Rio de Janeiro, Istanbul, Mumbai, and Johannesburg. (Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program) *** Detailing these seven broad types, the report aptly points out “there is no one way to be global city.” Each global city or metro has its own assets that enable it to better compete and prosper in the global economy. The task of economic development is to identify and build on those assets. Globalization might make us feel small in a growing world, but the lessons of urbanization should remind us how much more powerful we can be when we get connected. Together, these 123 global cities power global competitiveness. They generate a third of global economic output, account for nearly two-thirds of all innovations (based on patents), and represent more than 80 percent of all venture-capital investment in high-tech startups, while housing just 13 percent of the world’s population. That said, globalization and global urbanization does bring substantial challenges that are rising today more than ever. In a major speech based on the report, Amy Liu, who leads the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program, noted the challenges and divides that come with such concentrated spikes of global economic activity. The irony now is that all this energy and progress comes amidst a new environment: growing skepticism about global trade, concerns about immigrants and refugees, and pessimism about a slow-growing world economy… . How can cities deepen their efforts to be globally engaged and competitive while addressing head on the disparities and negative consequences that come with greater global integration? That’s the question that lies at the heart of our global cities and our collective global future.

Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. “I just don’t think the system is functioning the same and I think the monetary authorities are trying to figure out what these things do,” Dimon, 60, said Friday at the Institute of International Finance’s annual meeting in Washington. “Nor do I think the systems are coordinated. Fiscal policy and monetary policy -- if we got those things right I think we would have extra growth.” The U.S. central bank left its benchmark rate unchanged last month as it waits for more evidence of progress on inflation and employment, though policy makers signaled an increase is still likely by year-end. The European Central Bank also kept its rates and pace of bond purchases unchanged as it gave its technical committees a “full mandate” to propose redesigns for quantitative-easing, programs that boost the money supply through unconventional measures. “QE1 kind of worked, QE2 worked less, QE3 may not work,” Dimon said. “A little bit is pushing on a string -- no corporation is going to build a new plant because rates are low.” ‘Ineffective Cartel’ Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President Gary Cohn called the world’s central banks an “ineffective cartel” that’s causing global growth to stagnate. “We no longer have independent countries with independent central banks that can drive economic growth or contract economic growth within their own countries,” Cohn, 56, said earlier at the same conference. “We have a globalized world with a globalized work force and we therefore have a globalized monetary policy.” The International Monetary Fund this week kept its estimates for worldwide growth unchanged from July and said rising political tensions over globalization are threatening to derail a recovery. The global economy will expand 3.1 percent this year before accelerating 3.4 percent in 2017, while the U.S. economy, the world’s biggest, will grow 1.6 percent this year, down 0.6 percentage point from July’s estimate, the IMF said. Dimon and Cohn aren’t disinterested parties. Banks typically make more money when interest rates rise as the gap widens between how much they charge borrowers and pay depositors. Bank shares have climbed this year on days when speculation increases that the Fed is closer to boosting rates. Days before last month’s Fed meeting, Dimon encouraged the central bank to “just raise rates.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(NYSE: CWH) entered the market on a positive note for its initial public offering. The company priced its 11.4 million shares at $22 per share, which was the mid-point in its expected price range of $21 to $23 per share. At this price, the entire offering, including an overallotment option for an additional 1.7 million shares, is valued up to $288.2 million. The underwriters for the offering are Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Baird, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Wells Fargo and Stephens. This company is the only provider of a comprehensive portfolio of services, protection plans, products and resources for recreational vehicle (RV) enthusiasts. Roughly 9 million households in the United States own an RV, and of that installed base, Camping World has approximately 3.3 million active customers. The company generates recurring revenue by providing RV owners and enthusiasts the full spectrum of services, protection plans, products and resources that it believes are essential to operate, maintain and protect their RV and to enjoy the RV lifestyle. Camping World has 120 locations around the United States in key national RV markets. In 2015, the network generated roughly 3.5 million unique transactions, continuing to build its active customer database. The company highlighted a few key points related to its financial performance: Active Customer database had approximately 3.1 million customers on December 31, 2015, representing a 4.9% five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR). Total revenue was $3,333.3 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, representing a 21.3% five-year CAGR. Net income was $178.5 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, representing a 139.8% five-year CAGR. The company expects to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay its indebtedness, with the remainder being put toward working capital and general corporate purposes. CEO Marcus Lemonis said in a CNBC interview that the proceeds from this offering would be used to deleverage the company, which historically operates at three-times leverage. Shares of Camping World were last seen at $23.95, with a range of $23.62 to $24.35 on the day thus far. As of 10:30 a.m. Eastern, roughly 3 million shares have moved.

REUTERS/Dylan Martinez WASHINGTON Britain's vote to leave the European Union has made it more likely that the euro zone will not be around in 10 years, JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) CEO Jamie Dimon told bankers on Friday. "Brexit makes the chance of the euro zone not surviving 10 years from now five times higher," Dimon said at the Institute of International Finance's 2016 annual membership meeting in Washington. Speaking at the same event, James Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley (MS.N), said that the big winner from Brexit would be New York because business currently carried out in London would shift there.

It includes Fitch's 'Exposure Draft: Counterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds - Effective from April 14, 2016 to July 18, 2016' and 'Rating Criteria for U.S. Commercial Mortgage Servicers', which were omitted from the original release.) Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Waldorf Astoria Boca Raton Trust 2016-BOCA (WABR 2016-BOCA) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates series 2016-BOCA. Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as follows: --$145,100,000 class A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable; --$275,000,000a class X-CP 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$275,000,000a class X-NCP 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$50,500,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$37,400,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$42,000,000 class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$80,000,000 class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable; --$75,000,000 class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable. (a) Notional amount and interest-only. The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as of June 15, 2016. The certificates represent the beneficial interest in a trust that holds a two-year, floating-rate, interest-only $430 million mortgage loan secured by the fee and leasehold interests in the 1,047-room Waldorf Astoria Boca Raton Resort & Club. The loan is sponsored by the Blackstone Group, L.P. (Blackstone). The loan was co-originated by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (rated 'A+'/'F1+'/Stable Outlook) and Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company (rated 'A'/'F1'/Stable Outlook). KEY RATING DRIVERS High Leverage on Full Debt Stack: The total debt package includes mezzanine financing in the amount of $285 million that is not included in the trust. Fitch's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value (LTV) for the full debt stack are 0.66x and 165.5%, respectively. Fitch's DSCR and LTV for the trust component of the debt are 1.10x and 99.5%. Asset Quality: Fitch assigned the Waldorf Astoria Boca Raton Resort and Club a property quality grade of A-'. The collateral has both lakefront (Lake Boca Raton) and oceanfront (Atlantic Ocean) land. Property amenities include: a full-service spa, three fitness centers, 30 tennis courts, 16 food and beverage (F&B) outlets, two 18-hole golf courses, seven swimming pools including a FlowRider wave simulator, a 32-slip marina and approximately 200,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor meeting space. Significant Capital Invested by Sponsor: The sponsor acquired the property in 2004 and has invested $274.2 million ($261,886/key) since acquisition. Completed renovations include: complete room renovations at the Cloister, the Tower, and the Bungalows; construction of the Boca Beach Club; upgrades to the Yacht Club rooms; lobby modernization; F&B outlet improvements; and updating the meeting facilities. Non-traditional Hotel Income: For the trailing 12-month (TTM) period ended April 2016, approximately $64.1 million of non-room and non-F&B revenue was generated by the property, representing 29.6% of the property's total revenues. Ancillary revenue sources include golf, spa, tennis, beach, marina and club fees. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch found that the 'AAAsf' class could withstand an approximate 72.8% decrease to the most recent actual net cash flow (NCF) prior to experiencing $1 of loss to the 'AAAsf' rated class. Fitch performed several stress scenarios in which the Fitch NCF was stressed. Fitch determined that a 63.2% reduction in Fitch's implied NCF would cause the notes to break even at a 1x debt service coverage ratio (DSCR), based on the actual debt service. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings for class A and found that a 21% decline in Fitch's implied NCF would result in a one-category downgrade, while a 47% decline would result in a downgrade to below investment grade. The Rating Sensitivity section in the presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities. Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the accompanying presale report. The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's web site 'www.fitchratings.com' or by clicking on the link. DUE DILIGENCE USAGE Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst and Young, LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on ABS Due Diligence Form-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to the mortgage loan and related mortgaged properties in the data file. Fitch considered this information in its analysis, and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis. Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed. The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

We discussed Nuveen’s overall strategy, municipal bonds and Nuveen’s new aggregate bond ETF. Kremenstein also shared his opinions on some of the challenges and opportunities of competing in such a crowded and evolving ETF market. ETFdb.com: Please tell us about yourself as well as about the career trajectory that led you to becoming Head of ETFs at Nuveen. Martin Kremenstein (M.K.): I started working in finance in London back in 1998 straight out of school, and did a variety of jobs working for Chase Manhattan JPMorgan London. I entered the ETF space in August of 2006 when I joined Deutsche Bank. At the time, Deutsche Bank had one ETF, PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund (DBC A), and were about to launch their second ETF, PowerShares DB G10 Currency Harvest Fund (DBV A-). We built out our business. Asset flows in 2009 were phenomenal; we started the year at $4.5 billion and ended the year at $13.5 billion. We became the number six ETF issuer in the U.S. by assets at that point. We realized that for the business to continue to grow and thrive, we needed to pivot away from being just a commodity provider. We polished our offerings by acquiring PowerShares (which was sold to Invesco in 2014.) Furthermore, we decided to build international equity products that would allow investors to protect against the strength of the rising dollar. I helped launch those products and the U.S. X-trackers business as CEO of that business. A little over a year ago, I decided to look at other career options and was interested in going to a buy-side solution-based institution. I joined Nuveen in October 2015. ETFdb: Nuveen has strong exposure in the municipal bond market. What is Nuveen’s overall strategy in the ETF space? M.K.: Nuveen definitely has a strong muni shop, as that’s how we made our name originally. I think it’s important to consider Nuveen in the context that it is now – a division of TIAA Global Asset Management (TGAM). TGAM is an incredibly strong fixed income shop that runs assets for the overall insurance company. Our strategy is to tap into the strengths of TGAM in a way that’s additive to the lineup. The question we should really dig into is, “Where is TGAM strong?”, rather than “Where is Nuveen strong?” ETFdb: One of the primary reasons why investors invest in municipal bond ETFs would be for tax exemptions at the state and federal levels. Other than tax, what are the additional reasons why investors should look at municipal bonds? What would be a good piece of advice that you would give investors for due diligence related to munis? M.K.: Obviously, the main reason would be for tax advantages. I think investors are looking for a stable investment; many investors equate muni bonds as safe-haven investments. I think when you are looking at munis, you need diversification in your fixed income. It’s a great way to diversify without taking on added risk. I think munis is a very specialized market and, therefore, you need to do your due diligence on the manager. This applies to ETFs and index products. You need a good manager to execute against a benchmark; execution in fixed income is a big deal, especially in the less liquid parts of fixed income. Munis can become illiquid from time to time. I think having a skilled experienced manager with strength and depth is very important. ETFdb: Last year Nuveen revealed plans on converting a couple of commodity closed-end funds into ETFs – the Nuveen Diversified Commodity Fund and Nuveen Long/Short Commodity Total Return Fund. What was the rationale for bringing these ETFs to market? Do you think every investor should have some exposure to commodities in their portfolio? M.K.: I am a proponent of commodities in your portfolio. The biggest reasons for having them in your portfolio are for their diversification benefits and to hedge against expected inflation. In terms of the products you mentioned, they were trading at steep discounts. We wanted to find a way to close the gap i.e. discount, while allowing investors to stay invested and giving them a better outcome. For investors who wanted to get out, they can redeem their shares now. This was a way to satisfy both parties – people that wanted in and that wanted out. We felt this was the best way to do it. ETFdb: You recently had a new ETF that was launched – the NuShares Enhanced Yield US Aggregate Bond ETF (NUAG n/a). What inspired the vision for this particular ETF? What is the proposed strategy, and what type of securities will the ETF hold? M.K.: It is an aggregate universe we started with; it’s the BofA Merrill Lynch Global Broad Bond Market Index. It is targeted toward the U.S. investor and denominated in U.S. dollars. We divided the aggregate universe into 38 sectors by maturity and by underlying asset class, like Treasuries, corporates, securitized debt and then, within those maturities and asset classes, by credit rating. We are breaking the link between issuance weighting and the weighting in your portfolio. Rather than weighting by issuance, we are weighting by yield and overweighting high-yielding sectors. We have a strong quantitative fixed-income team at TGAM. We used our models to isolate a risk factor, similar to factor investing, but at a fixed-income level. Historically, the majority of returns have come from yield, so why not weight by that? Which is what the NUAG ETF does; it divides the aggregate universe into buckets, and builds an optimized portfolio in which we are high yielding without taking on any extra duration. We haven’t downgraded the credit spectrum by much, and have kept our key rate risk the same. It is this risk-managed framework that allows you to boost your core fixed-income holding. ETFdb: What are some of the challenges and opportunities of competing in such a crowded ETF market? How do you see the ETF industry evolving over the next five years? M.K.: I think the biggest challenge is getting space to be sold and to be heard. There are so many active managers doing multi-factor ETFs. For us, we want to zig where others zag. We are looking for less served areas of the market. If I am the 20th multi-factor option out there, I am not really offering investors anything new. The real challenge is to find out where those under-served areas of the market lie. The markets are evolving, investors are evolving, and so we have to keep staying relevant. It is important to keep your eye on the markets, investors and their demographics, and your competitors. Another challenge is that the distribution model is changing as well, so you have to keep your eye on that. The client base is changing; the intermediaries and their clients are changing also. I also think there are more smart-beta products coming. We’ve already hit the large buckets – large-cap equity, international equity, mid-/small-cap equity and so on. Fixed income has a fairly blank slate. I think there are $7 billion of assets in smart-beta fixed-income right now. If you extrapolate out fixed-income ETFs to 2020, you can ask yourself, “What if smart beta became the same percentage of fixed income that is in equities right now at 25%?” That is a $200 billion dollar opportunity. Smart beta will also likely start to permeate other asset classes. ETFdb: Fixed-income ETFs is one of the stories of the 2016 years with almost $43 billion going into that space. Is this a case of liquidity transformation – where liquidity challenged securities are being prepackaged into liquid securities – or is this liquidity all just an illusion? M.K.: An ETF is as liquid as the least liquid constituent in the basket. You cannot magically create liquidity. I think ETFs can be a much better leading indicator of liquidity when it comes to fixed income. If you see a bond ETF trading at a discount to its NAV, it is a very likely indicator of where the bonds in the basket should be priced. The ETF wrapper, overall, is not magically going to create liquidity. ETFdb: What would be your best piece of advice for investors in this market environment? M.K.: I think you have to do your due diligence – manager due diligence as well as index due diligence. I think that managers are less important in the equity space, because many of the baskets are 100 percent replicable and much of the creation/redemption is done in kind. In the fixed-income space, I think you need to look at the pedigree and capabilities of the manager, of the overall team and of the overall setup. This is because you are negotiating baskets a little more; the underlying bond securities are traded over-the-counter and there is limited transparency as dealers act as market makers, directly negotiating buy and sell prices. The Bottom Line Nuveen’s new ETF, the NuShares Enhanced Yield US Aggregate Bond ETF (NUAG n/a), is designed to be a core fixed-income holding that looks to boost yield without adding extra duration or diminishing credit quality. Nuveen sees more smart-beta products coming into the fixed-income space, as it’s a $200 billion market ready for the taking.

Hurricane Matthew is just off the east coast of Florida near Cape Canaveral, the National Hurricane Center said in an advisory on Friday, after killing at least 339 people in Haiti on its move north through the Caribbean. Data modelling firm RMS has told clients its initial estimates were a 42 percent chance of a $20 billion insurance loss and a 26 percent chance of a $30 billion loss from the hurricane, a source familiar with the research said. Ben Brookes, vice president capital markets at RMS told Reuters its guidance to clients was based on a forecast from earlier in the week. “We have continued to update our guidance as the situation changes,” Brookes said, without giving further details. An estimate from Kinetic Analysis of insured losses of $25 billion would make Matthew “the second most costly hurricane in U.S. history behind Katrina”, JPMorgan analysts said in a note late Thursday, referring to the hurricane which hit New Orleans and the surrounding coast in 2005. Kinetic could not immediately be reached for comment. Market participants expect these estimates to rise. “People are looking at this literally every minute and working overnight on it,” one trader said. The average impact to U.S. property and casualty insurers’ book value from $10-30 billion of insured losses from the hurricane would equate to around a quarter’s worth of earnings, the JPMorgan analysts added. A $20 billion insured loss would match the insured losses caused by Hurricane Sandy in the northeast of the United States in 2012, which did not make landfall. A loss of this size would lead to “material risks” for Lloyd’s of London insurers, analyst Ben Cohen at Canaccord Genuity said in a note on Friday. Cohen calculated a loss equivalent to Sandy would hit Beazley’s earnings by $104 million, Hiscox’s by 117 million pounds ($145 million) and Lancashire’s by $39 million. Beazley estimates an $80 billion storm would cause a $200 million loss, a spokesman said, without specifying losses from a smaller disaster. A Hiscox spokeswoman said it was too early to judge the impact of the hurricane. A Lancashire spokesman also said it was early days, but the firm was feeling “relatively relaxed” about its losses because it was very lightly exposed to risk in Florida compared with other states in which it offers reinsurance for wind damage. The hurricane represented a “real test” of reinsurers’ exposure, S&P Global said in a report, but it did not see a ratings impact, due to reinsurers’ strong capital buffers.
