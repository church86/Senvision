John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Sep 6, 2016 at 4:00PM When it comes to dividends and stock buybacks, these two banks make it rain. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. One reason investors have long had a penchant for bank stocks is because they tend to pay generous dividends. But quarterly distributions are only half the story when it comes to rewarding shareholders. To get a true sense of how much capital a bank returns to its shareholders, you also have to factor in stock buybacks. If you combine the amount of money that the nation's biggest banks pay out to shareholders through both of these methods, two bank stocks separate themselves from the pack: Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Over the past 12 months, these banks distributed nearly twice as much capital as third- and fourth-place finishers Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author. There are three reasons that Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase are in a league of their own when it comes to returning capital, the first of which relates to their size. JPMorgan Chase is the biggest bank in the country. At the end of the second quarter, the New York City-based bank had $2.5 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet. And if you include assets that it administers but are owned by clients -- namely, assets under management or custody -- then its size balloons to nearly $25 trillion. Wells Fargo, by contrast, ranks third, with $1.9 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet. This is smaller than Bank of America, which has $2.2 trillion in assets, but Wells Fargo is gaining quickly on its larger rival. It eclipsed Citigroup last year to lay claim to the No. 3 spot, and at Wells Fargo's current rate of growth, it could do the same to Bank of America in the near future. The second reason that Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase distribute so much capital to shareholders is because they earn a lot of money. Wells Fargo reported $22.4 billion in net income over the past 12 months, according to data from YCharts.com, while JPMorgan Chase earned an even more impressive $23.9 billion. They have little choice but to pay out a lot of capital, in other words, to ensure that it doesn't build up on their balance sheets and thereby weigh down their return on equity, which is the primary profitability metric tracked by bank stock investors. This helps to explain why Bank of America and Citigroup trade for such low valuations, as their less-generous dividend and buyback programs have swelled their respective shareholders' equities. The final reason that Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase pay out so much more than their counterparts is because they can. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed in the wake of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve gained veto power over bank capital plans. Now, if a bank wants to boost its dividend or its repurchase authorization, it must request the Fed's permission in the comprehensive capital analysis and review (CCAR), the second stage of the annual stress tests. This is inconvenient, but it hasn't stopped Wells Fargo or JPMorgan Chase from raising their dividends every year since 2011. Bank of America and Citigroup, by contrast, haven't been as fortunate. Both have had their capital proposals rejected by the central bank multiple times since the stress tests were inaugurated six years ago. The net result is that they've been allowed to boost their dividends only twice each since the crisis, most recently this year. In sum, if you're looking for bank stocks that return the most capital to shareholders, then the obvious place to start is by going with the biggest and best banks in the country: Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase.

"QE reduces lending rates to negative and we are going to expect negative lending rates until 2021," Kian Abouhossein, head of European banks equity research at JPMorgan told CNBC Tuesday. "So as long as that is the case, margins will not improve. Sixty percent of revenues is net interest income and as long as that's the case earnings will not improve. So return on equity is very low." European banks are more akin to their Japanese counterparts and less like Wall Street, warns JPMorgan, who has detailed how a negative interest rate policy has led to ongoing pressure on revenues and profit margins. Europe has seen a balance sheet recession since the economic crisis of 2008, it said, highlighting that a 10.9 percent increase in reserves at these banks has failed to increase lending to the wider economy. "QE has worked initially and helped to stabilize asset prices, and to lower funding cost for banks …. However, the secondary long-term effects of QE are manifesting themselves in the form of pressure on revenues for European Banks with customer margins in euro area declining from 2.5 percent in 2011 to 1.8 percent in 2015," the report said. The European Central Bank (ECB), the Danish National Bank (DNB), the Swedish Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) have all pushed key short-term policy rates into negative territory. A negative interest rate policy, or NIRP, essentially charges banks to hold cash at a central bank in the hope that they will instead lend to the real economy. Many expect banks to pass on this disincentive to save to its customers by trimming rates or by ramping up borrowing costs. The policy is increasingly being seen as a viable option for central bankers after Japan's move below zero earlier this year. While this stimulates growth in some cases, negative rates put pressure on other sectors of the economy. A number of leading analysts have called for a balance of monetary and fiscal measures in order to slowly get the economy out of "QE infinity" – a paradox whereby low rates and seemingly endless rounds of bond-buying programs encourage cheap borrowing. Alberto Gallo, head of macro strategies and manager of the Algebris Macro Credit Fund, told CNBC last week that for the global economy to exit this QE infinity trap, government action and reforms to improve productivity are needed. "Many governments are reluctant to accept the need for these measures, often instead implementing policies that win votes but compound the distortions of easy monetary policy e.g. housing affordability programmes, mortgage subsidies," he said. Without an adequate fiscal response from governments, growing imbalances make it harder to withdraw stimulus, warned Gallo. However, profit margins are not the only problems that banks in Europe are facing currently. "There are two factors," Abouhossein told CNBC. "Operationally it is cost cutting and second is finding a price for non-performing loans. Non-performing loans need to come off the balance sheet. We have 700 billion euros($781 billion) of non-performing loans, half of that in southern Europe, 30 percent in Italy so we need to clean up." Italian policymakers and European Union (EU) officials have been pondering how to improve Italy's fragile banking system in recent months, which has been bogged down by non-performing loans estimated to total around 360 billion euros ($401 billion).

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search JPMorgan’s Capital Market Assumptions Suggest a New Type of Portfolio Construction September 6, 2016 11:11am NYSE:JPM ShareTweet A number of asset managers publish their long-term capital market assumptions on at least an annual basis.  For the unfamiliar, capital market assumptions present an individual’s or firm’s view on asset class returns, volatilities, and correlations. Typically, we tend to be skeptical of these types of forecasts.  Not because we think capital market assumptions are useless, but rather because they are often presented as truths instead of assumptions. That being said, we are big fans of J.P. Morgan’s capital market assumption piece.  They published the 20th anniversary version of their outlook in October of last year. There are three things that really set J.P. Morgan’s work apart. They do not suffer from black box syndrome. The assumptions are not presented devoid of any context as to where they came from.  Instead, they go into quite a bit of detail on their methodology and the beliefs that form the foundation of their forecasts.  This transparency is crucial.  It allows investors to use the assumptions in a thoughtful, informed way.For example, the following graphic presents their forecasts for the evolution of cash interest rates in the United States, United Kingdom, Eurozone, and Japan over the next fifteen years.  If you agree with their beliefs, great.  If you don’t, you don’t have to throw away their capital market assumptions.  Instead, you could adjust the assumptions based on how you think cash rates with evolve. They recognize the limitations of normality. Post-2008, most investors seem to now be aware that many asset class returns are not normal, but instead exhibit “fat tails.” By summarizing asset class behavior with expected returns, volatilities, and correlations, most sets of capital market assumptions either ignore this reality or try to adjust for it in their volatility/correlation estimates in some non-transparent way. J.P. Morgan tackles the problem head-on, including a six-page article titled “Modelling and managing fat-tailed market risks.” The article starts on page 36 of the full document. They hold themselves accountable by comparing their past projections to the market reality that actually unfolded subsequent to publication.  To date, actual market returns have been statistically consistent with J.P. Morgan projections. All of this being said, we do find J.P. Morgan’s piece to be a bit lacking when it comes to laying out simple, actionable takeaways for portfolio construction. Now, this very well could be intentional and so is not meant as a criticism.  However, we thought it would make sense to explore what J.P. Morgan’s asset class views imply for portfolio construction. Quick sidebar: This commentary is not an endorsement by Newfound of J.P. Morgan’s views.  While we agree with much of what they say, we have disagreements as well.  Instead, this commentary is meant to explore the implications for portfolio construction if J.P. Morgan’s assumptions are accurate.  All capital market assumptions discussed come from J.P. Morgan Asset Management as of September 30, 2015 except for hedge fund returns and indices, which are as of June 30, 2015.  Capital market assumptions are – as the name states – assumptions and are not a guarantee of future performance.  Traditional Stock/Bond Risk Profiles Are Suboptimal… Constraining portfolios to only stocks and bonds is costly in today’s market environment. Using J.P. Morgan’s assumptions, we can significantly improve the efficient frontier by removing asset class constraints and considering a full palette of investment options.  For example, J.P. Morgan estimates a 6.0% expected return and 10.6% volatility for a 60/40 portfolio of global stocks (MSCI ACWI) and U.S. core bonds (Barclays Aggregate). For the same 10.6% target volatility, the expected return rises by 1.1% to 7.1% when we consider unconstrained access to the full universe. Source: Capital market assumptions from J.P. Morgan.  Optimization performed by Newfound Research using a simulation-based process to account for parameter uncertainty.  Certain asset classes listed in J.P. Morgan’s capital market assumptions were not considered because they were either (i) redundant due to other asset classes that were included or (ii) difficult to access outside of private or non-liquid investment vehicles. 1.1% of extra annual return is meaningful.  However, flipping the perspective gives even better context. On the full frontier where all asset classes are considered, how much volatility do we need to take on to achieve the same 6.0% expected return as the traditional 60/40 portfolio?  The answer: 6.5%, a nearly 40% reduction in volatility just from taking off the asset class handcuffs. The Takeaway: Passive, market-cap weighted stock/bond allocation profiles ignore macroeconomics, fundamentals, valuations, and risk and so may be non-optimal.    …But Doing Better Than Traditional Stock/Bond Risk Profiles Means Stomaching Tracking Error Like anything in life, this potential improvement does not come free.  In this case, the most stomach-churning cost – assuming that the capital market assumptions are accurate – likely comes from tracking error since the unconstrained portfolios would almost surely be benchmarked against their traditional counterparts. We computed the tracking error between unconstrained portfolios on the efficient frontier and traditional MSCI ACWI / Barclays Aggregate portfolios with the same target volatility.  In this context, positive (negative) numbers imply that the unconstrained portfolio outperforms (underperforms).  Below, we use this data to plot a 90% confidence interval for the annual return differential between the two approaches. Source: Capital market assumptions from J.P. Morgan.  Optimization performed by Newfound Research using a simulation-based process to account for parameter uncertainty.  Certain asset classes listed in J.P. Morgan’s capital market assumptions were not considered because they were either (i) redundant due to other asset classes that were included or (ii) difficult to access outside of private or non-liquid investment vehicles.    Sidebar: You might be wondering why in the graph above the leftmost column is labeled as a 4/96 stock/bond portfolio instead of a 0/100 stock/bond portfolio.  We use the 4/96 portfolio since this is the minimum volatility profile assuming that the allocation decision is only between the MSCI ACWI and Barclays Aggregate Bond.  In other words, a 0/100 portfolio is actually more volatility using J.P. Morgan’s assumptions than a 0/100, so we use the 4/96 as our lowest risk comparison point.     Let’s return to our 60% MSCI ACWI / 40% Barclays Aggregate Bond example to understand exactly what this means.  As we mentioned before, the volatility of this portfolio – using J.P. Morgan’s capital market assumptions – is 10.6%.  An unconstrained portfolio, targeting the same 10.6% volatility, is expected to outperform by 1.1%. However, this expected outperformance comes with tracking error of 3.4%.  The 90% confidence interval ranges from -4.5% to 5.6%.  In non-statistical language, this means that while we expect the unconstrained portfolio to outperform by 1.1%, this is by no means a guarantee.  The actual performance differential will vary year-by-year.  The confidence interval implies that we can be 90% confident that the actual outcome will range from the unconstrained model underperforming by 4.5% to the unconstrained modeloutperforming by 5.6%. Quite a range of possibilities! Another way to think about this issue is through the lens of underperformance probability.  Assuming that J.P. Morgan’s assumptions are correct – i.e. the unconstrained portfolio really is expected to outperform on average – what is the likelihood that the unconstrained portfolio underperforms its traditional counterpart over various holding periods? For a 1-year holding period, the probability of underperforming is not much less than the probability of losing a coin flip.  For longer holding periods, the chances of underperforming declines, but still remains meaningful.  The unconstrained portfolio has a 29%, 23%, and 15% probability of underperforming the traditional 60/40 over 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year holding periods, respectively. Source: Capital market assumptions from J.P. Morgan.  Optimization performed by Newfound Research using a simulation-based process to account for parameter uncertainty.  Certain asset classes listed in J.P. Morgan’s capital market assumptions were not considered because they were either (i) redundant due to other asset classes that were included or (ii) difficult to access outside of private or non-liquid investment vehicles.    The Takeaway: For optimized portfolios to be better than traditional stock/bond risk profiles, they must be different.  Allocation differences create tracking error and the possibility of underperformance, especially over shorter time horizons.    Satellite Fixed Income Is King The reason for the tracking error discussed in the last section becomes obvious when we look under the hood of the unconstrained frontier. Source: Capital market assumptions from J.P. Morgan.  Optimization performed by Newfound Research using a simulation-based process to account for parameter uncertainty.  Certain asset classes listed in J.P. Morgan’s capital market assumptions were not considered because they were either (i) redundant due to other asset classes that were included or (ii) difficult to access outside of private or non-liquid investment vehicles.    The optimized portfolio with 60/40 equivalent volatility has only 35% core stocks and 3% core bonds with the remaining 62% split between satellite fixed income (e.g. high yield corporates, high yield municipals, emerging market bonds, levered loans) and alternatives.  A similar pattern emerges for other volatility levels. Interesting results include: Core fixed income is significantly underweight relative to traditional risk profiles. For most conservative risk profiles, alternatives serve as a risk management complement to core fixed income without the return drag from historically low interest rates. Equities are also significantly underweight. When equities do enter the portfolios, there is a major bias towards international equities and away from U.S. equities. Satellite fixed income is king.  These asset classes, many of which exhibit hybrid fixed income/equity characteristics, have decidedly un-satellite-like allocations.  They help carry the risk mitigation burden of core bonds and the return generation burden of core stocks. The Takeaway: Most investors need both return generators and risk mitigators in their portfolio.  Historically, core stocks and bonds have slotted nicely into these roles.  Going forward, it is becoming increasingly important to look to other asset classes (e.g. satellite fixed income) and strategies (e.g. managed futures, equity long/short) to fulfill these roles.  Practical Considerations In reality, a moderate allocation portfolio with 2% invested in U.S. equities is problematic.  Almost all investors exhibit favoritism towards their home markets, and U.S. investors are no different.  This home market bias means that the considerable tracking error that the unconstrained portfolio would have to U.S. equities could create behavioral problems. Even if we were 100% sure of the accuracy of these assumptions – and therefore the long-term efficacy of our portfolio – having U.S. equities as a core reference point may create considerable short-run anxiety during periods our optimized portfolio underperforms.  Ultimately, a portfolio is only long-term optimal if we can have the discipline to stick with it in the short-run. This is, of course, all before we even consider we can never actually be sure that any set of capital market assumptions, no matter how thoughtfully constructed, fully and accurately represent asset class behavior.  Uncertainty around these assumptions is just another form of model risk. Managing these behavioral and model risks is a combination of art and science.  On the science front, we can employ optimization techniques that explicitly account for parameter uncertainty.  On the art front, we may wish to blend a number of complementary allocation approaches.  For a traditional “60/40” investor, this may mean something like this: 1/3rd allocation to market-cap weighted, passive “60/40” reference portfolio. 1/3rd allocation to unconstrained, long-term optimized portfolio using capital market assumptions (here we continue to use J.P. Morgan assumptions). 1/3rd allocation to tactical asset allocation (for the example, we use an equally weighted combination of our Risk Managed Global Sectors, Multi-Asset Income, and Total Return strategies). As of today, the individual sleeve and overall portfolio allocations would look something like this: Allocations are presented as an illustrative example of how an investor may think of portfolio construction.  Allocations are subject to change and should not be considered investment advice.  Client Talking Points Based on J.P. Morgan’s outlook, investors looking to maximize success over the next decade must look beyond core stocks and bonds. For these forward-looking investors, satellite fixed income asset classes like high yield bonds may offer valuable diversification without necessarily sacrificing return since they offer attractive yields. Alternatives, especially those strategies with a focus on risk management, can be attractive risk mitigators in a low-interest rate environment where large allocations to core bonds, the classic risk mitigator, will likely drag down overall portfolio returns. Employing forward-looking asset allocations generally means deviating from traditional stock/bond risk profiles. To be better, we have to be different.  Allocation differences will inevitably lead to periods of short-term underperformance.  Successfully implementing a forward-looking asset allocation means having appropriate expectations as well as the discipline to stick with it through periods of underperformance.

"QE reduces lending rates to negative and we are going to expect negative lending rates until 2021," Kian Abouhossein, head of European banks equity research at JPMorgan told CNBC Tuesday. "So as long as that is the case, margins will not improve. Sixty percent of revenues is net interest income and as long as that's the case earnings will not improve. So return on equity is very low." Balance sheet recession European banks are more akin to their Japanese counterparts and less like Wall Street, warns JPMorgan, who has detailed how a negative interest rate policy has led to ongoing pressure on revenues and profit margins. Europe has seen a balance sheet recession since the economic crisis of 2008, it said, highlighting that a 10.9 percent increase in reserves at these banks has failed to increase lending to the wider economy. "QE has worked initially and helped to stabilize asset prices, and to lower funding cost for banks …. However, the secondary long-term effects of QE are manifesting themselves in the form of pressure on revenues for European Banks with customer margins in euro area declining from 2.5 percent in 2011 to 1.8 percent in 2015," the report said. The European Central Bank (ECB), the Danish National Bank (DNB), the Swedish Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank (SNB) have all pushed key short-term policy rates into negative territory. A negative interest rate policy, or NIRP, essentially charges banks to hold cash at a central bank in the hope that they will instead lend to the real economy. Many expect banks to pass on this disincentive to save to its customers by trimming rates or by ramping up borrowing costs. The policy is increasingly being seen as a viable option for central bankers after Japan's move below zero earlier this year. QE infinity Kazuhiro Hogi | AFP | Getty Images A pedestrian walks past an electric quotation board displaying the rate of the Japanese yen against the US dollar (R) in Tokyo on July 29, 2016. Tokyo shares rose on July 29 with lenders boosted by the Bank of Japan's decision not to cut interest rates further into negative territory. While this stimulates growth in some cases, negative rates put pressure on other sectors of the economy. A number of leading analysts have called for a balance of monetary and fiscal measures in order to slowly get the economy out of "QE infinity" – a paradox whereby low rates and seemingly endless rounds of bond-buying programs encourage cheap borrowing. Alberto Gallo, head of macro strategies and manager of the Algebris Macro Credit Fund, told CNBC last week that for the global economy to exit this QE infinity trap, government action and reforms to improve productivity are needed. "Many governments are reluctant to accept the need for these measures, often instead implementing policies that win votes but compound the distortions of easy monetary policy e.g. housing affordability programmes, mortgage subsidies," he said. Without an adequate fiscal response from governments, growing imbalances make it harder to withdraw stimulus, warned Gallo. The NPL problem However, profit margins are not the only problems that banks in Europe are facing currently. "There are two factors," Abouhossein told CNBC. "Operationally it is cost cutting and second is finding a price for non-performing loans. Non-performing loans need to come off the balance sheet. We have 700 billion euros($781 billion) of non-performing loans, half of that in southern Europe, 30 percent in Italy so we need to clean up." Italian policymakers and European Union (EU) officials have been pondering how to improve Italy's fragile banking system in recent months, which has been bogged down by non-performing loans estimated to total around 360 billion euros ($401 billion).

WASHINGTON (TNS) — For millions of Americans, a reminder of the economic damage of the 2007-09 recession has arrived every week or two for years — in their paychecks. Painfully slow wage growth has limited economic recovery, with many workers getting few if any raises. But there are signs that has started to change. The falling unemployment rate has led to more competition for workers, spurring solid gains in average hourly earnings in recent months. Those pressures, amplified by laws providing minimum-wage increases in California, New York and elsewhere, also are triggering changes for the workers who need raises the most. Beginning last year, large companies such as Wal-Mart, Starbucks, McDonald’s and JPMorgan Chase increased what they pay their lowest-level employees. “A pay increase is the right thing to do,” JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said recently in announcing raises that would bring the hourly pay of bank tellers, customer service representatives and other employees to at least $12 an hour in three years, from the current $10.15. “Wages for many Americans have gone nowhere for too long,” he wrote in a New York Times opinion article. The same message has emanated from the presidential campaigns of Republicans and Democrats. When adjusted for inflation, median annual household incomes declined to $53,657 in 2014, the most recent year for which government data are available, from $57,724 in 2000. “Household incomes are more than $4,000 lower than their levels in the year 2000,” Republican nominee Donald Trump said at a rally in Virginia last month. “Think of it … you’re making $4,000 less now than you did 16, 17 years ago.” Wage growth already was taking a hit this century for several reasons. One factor is the loss of bargaining power caused by a drop in the share of private-sector unionized workers; another is the decline in higher-paying manufacturing jobs as companies moved more factories abroad. As a result, the share of money flowing into households from wages began falling sharply compared with capital income from interest and dividends, according to a study last year by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The 2008 financial crisis and the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression amplified those changes, further stifling overall wage growth. But after two years of strong job growth, job openings are near record levels. That’s forced employers to raise pay to attract new workers and retain existing ones, economists said. Average hourly earnings increased 2.4 percent for the 12 months ended Aug. 31. Annual wage gains have been consistently in that range since last fall — they reached a seven-year high of 2.7 percent year-over-year in July — an improvement from the tepid 2 percent during much the first six years of the recovery. With annual inflation running below 1 percent, the accelerating wage growth is boosting workers’ purchasing power. In addition, more middle-income jobs are being created than was the case earlier in the economic recovery, indicating that wage gains are being spread more evenly among the workforce. From 2010 to 2013, new jobs that paid between about $30,000 and $50,000 annually lagged well behind high- and low-wage positions, according to research released recently by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But from 2013-15, the U.S. added about 2.3 million middle-income jobs in fields such as construction, education, and transportation. During the same period, the economy created about 1.5 million high-paying jobs and about 1.6 million low-paying jobs. Some states and localities have tried to accelerate wage recovery for low-income workers by raising minimum wages. There now are 29 states, plus the District of Columbia, that have minimum wages higher than the federal level of $7.25 an hour, which hasn’t budged since 2009. In April, California Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that will raise the minimum wage in California to $15 an hour by 2022. Also in April, New York enacted legislation that will raise the minimum wage there to $15. The increases vary by region — faster for New York City, slower for more rural areas — and it is unclear when the entire state will hit that level. As the states with the nation’s largest and third-largest populations moved to increase their minimum wages, large companies realized that they’d soon have to raise the pay of many of their workers. That was one factor behind the nationwide pay raises that several began announcing last year. “We certainly are mindful of wage increases in various states throughout the country,” McDonald’s chief financial officer Kevin M. Ozan said during an earnings call in July “It has, from a purely business standpoint, created an incentive to lift the wages at the bottom across their workforces,” said Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, which has been pushing for a $15-an-hour minimum wage. “A lot of companies … were getting a lot of bad press about how they treated their employees, and raising wages was an obvious way to respond to that,” she said. Early last year, Wal-Mart became the first major employer to announce raises for its lowest-paid workers. It now pays them at least $10 an hour once they finish the company’s training program. Wal-Mart is spending $2.7 billion over two years to increase pay, bringing the average full-time hourly rate for its workers to $13.38. Brett Biggs, the company’s chief financial officer, predicted the investment “will pay off long-term.” “Whether it’s lower attrition rates in the stores, better motivated associates, we think we’ll see the benefits from that,” he told an investor conference in June. Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz cited similar reasons after announcing this summer that the company would raise base pay for its workers by at least 5 percent in October. The company’s baristas earn an average of about $9.40 an hour, according to Glassdoor. “What we want to try and do is really get ahead of any federal or state mandate to be the employer of choice,” Schultz told analysts on an earnings call in July. After saying last year that he opposed an increase in the federal minimum wage, Trump this summer said he thought it should be raised to at least $10. The Democratic Party’s official platform calls for increasing the federal minimum wage to $15. “Raising the federal minimum wage won’t just put more money in the pockets of low-income families, it also means they will spend more at the businesses in their neighborhoods,” Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton told a Michigan crowd last month. “We need to get incomes and wages rising, and it will help the whole economy grow and be fairer.” Tags Wage Worker Employee Company Gain Minimum Wage Job MARC WEHRS Follow MARC WEHRS Close Get email notifications on MARC WEHRS daily!

WASHINGTON (TNS) — For millions of Americans, a reminder of the economic damage of the 2007-09 recession has arrived every week or two for years — in their paychecks. Painfully slow wage growth has limited economic recovery, with many workers getting few if any raises. But there are signs that has started to change. The falling unemployment rate has led to more competition for workers, spurring solid gains in average hourly earnings in recent months. Those pressures, amplified by laws providing minimum-wage increases in California, New York and elsewhere, also are triggering changes for the workers who need raises the most. Beginning last year, large companies such as Wal-Mart, Starbucks, McDonald’s and JPMorgan Chase increased what they pay their lowest-level employees. “A pay increase is the right thing to do,” JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said recently in announcing raises that would bring the hourly pay of bank tellers, customer service representatives and other employees to at least $12 an hour in three years, from the current $10.15. “Wages for many Americans have gone nowhere for too long,” he wrote in a New York Times opinion article. The same message has emanated from the presidential campaigns of Republicans and Democrats. When adjusted for inflation, median annual household incomes declined to $53,657 in 2014, the most recent year for which government data are available, from $57,724 in 2000. “Household incomes are more than $4,000 lower than their levels in the year 2000,” Republican nominee Donald Trump said at a rally in Virginia last month. “Think of it … you’re making $4,000 less now than you did 16, 17 years ago.” Wage growth already was taking a hit this century for several reasons. One factor is the loss of bargaining power caused by a drop in the share of private-sector unionized workers; another is the decline in higher-paying manufacturing jobs as companies moved more factories abroad. As a result, the share of money flowing into households from wages began falling sharply compared with capital income from interest and dividends, according to a study last year by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The 2008 financial crisis and the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression amplified those changes, further stifling overall wage growth. But after two years of strong job growth, job openings are near record levels. That’s forced employers to raise pay to attract new workers and retain existing ones, economists said. Average hourly earnings increased 2.4 percent for the 12 months ended Aug. 31. Annual wage gains have been consistently in that range since last fall — they reached a seven-year high of 2.7 percent year-over-year in July — an improvement from the tepid 2 percent during much the first six years of the recovery. With annual inflation running below 1 percent, the accelerating wage growth is boosting workers’ purchasing power. In addition, more middle-income jobs are being created than was the case earlier in the economic recovery, indicating that wage gains are being spread more evenly among the workforce. From 2010 to 2013, new jobs that paid between about $30,000 and $50,000 annually lagged well behind high- and low-wage positions, according to research released recently by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But from 2013-15, the U.S. added about 2.3 million middle-income jobs in fields such as construction, education, and transportation. During the same period, the economy created about 1.5 million high-paying jobs and about 1.6 million low-paying jobs. Some states and localities have tried to accelerate wage recovery for low-income workers by raising minimum wages. There now are 29 states, plus the District of Columbia, that have minimum wages higher than the federal level of $7.25 an hour, which hasn’t budged since 2009. In April, California Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that will raise the minimum wage in California to $15 an hour by 2022. Also in April, New York enacted legislation that will raise the minimum wage there to $15. The increases vary by region — faster for New York City, slower for more rural areas — and it is unclear when the entire state will hit that level. As the states with the nation’s largest and third-largest populations moved to increase their minimum wages, large companies realized that they’d soon have to raise the pay of many of their workers. That was one factor behind the nationwide pay raises that several began announcing last year. “We certainly are mindful of wage increases in various states throughout the country,” McDonald’s chief financial officer Kevin M. Ozan said during an earnings call in July “It has, from a purely business standpoint, created an incentive to lift the wages at the bottom across their workforces,” said Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, which has been pushing for a $15-an-hour minimum wage. “A lot of companies … were getting a lot of bad press about how they treated their employees, and raising wages was an obvious way to respond to that,” she said. Early last year, Wal-Mart became the first major employer to announce raises for its lowest-paid workers. It now pays them at least $10 an hour once they finish the company’s training program. Wal-Mart is spending $2.7 billion over two years to increase pay, bringing the average full-time hourly rate for its workers to $13.38. Brett Biggs, the company’s chief financial officer, predicted the investment “will pay off long-term.” “Whether it’s lower attrition rates in the stores, better motivated associates, we think we’ll see the benefits from that,” he told an investor conference in June. Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz cited similar reasons after announcing this summer that the company would raise base pay for its workers by at least 5 percent in October. The company’s baristas earn an average of about $9.40 an hour, according to Glassdoor. “What we want to try and do is really get ahead of any federal or state mandate to be the employer of choice,” Schultz told analysts on an earnings call in July. After saying last year that he opposed an increase in the federal minimum wage, Trump this summer said he thought it should be raised to at least $10. The Democratic Party’s official platform calls for increasing the federal minimum wage to $15. “Raising the federal minimum wage won’t just put more money in the pockets of low-income families, it also means they will spend more at the businesses in their neighborhoods,” Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton told a Michigan crowd last month. “We need to get incomes and wages rising, and it will help the whole economy grow and be fairer.” Tags Wage Worker Employee Company Gain Minimum Wage Job MARC WEHRS Follow MARC WEHRS Close Get email notifications on MARC WEHRS daily!

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:05 PM, September 5, 2016 Updated: 7:35 PM, September 5, 2016 LONDON - Britain's Barclays <BARC.L> has hired JPMorgan <JPM.N> banker Tim Throsby to head its Corporate and International division, ending a six-month search for the number two job under Chief Executive Jes Staley. Throsby, 50, will also run Barclays' investment banking business within that division, filling the gap left by the departure of Tom King who retired from the bank in March. Subject to regulatory approvals, Throsby is expected to take up his new role in January, Barclays said. Staley has been running the division himself while the bank searched for a replacement. King's exit had been rumored for some months prior to his departure. The investment bank chief threatened to quit last summer during a row with the then CEO Antony Jenkins over the future of the division, people familiar with the matter told Reuters at the time. King's departure came as Staley announced the creation of Barclays' corporate and international division as part of a new strategy focused on the United States and Britain. This saw the bank divided into two units, Barclays UK and Barclays Corporate and International, to comply with ring-fencing regulations aimed at safeguarding its retail banking business from riskier operations. Income from Barclays' investment banking division fell 5 percent in the first six months of this year, as it suffered from industry-wide problems including declining client trading, increased regulatory costs and persistently low interest rates. Barclays ranked 7th among banks worldwide advising on mergers in the first half of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data, 4th for debt deals and 9th for equity financing. The bank's shares are down 20 percent so far this year, after suffering their worst single-day drop on record following Britain's vote to exit the EU on June 23. Throsby, an Australian, joined JPMorgan in 2010 as global head of equity derivatives before being promoted to global head of equities in September 2012. He has also worked for Credit Suisse, Macquarie, Citadel Asia and Lehman Brothers. He joins a number of JPMorgan alumni recruited by Staley, who was himself CEO of the U.S. lender's investment bank before leaving JPMorgan in 2013 and joining Barclays in December last year. Former JPMorgan bankers now in senior roles at Barclays include finance director Tushar Morzaria, chief information officer Mark Ashton-Rigby, chief operating officer Paul Compton, and chief risk officer CS Venkatakrishnan.

E-Magazines Wages, long stagnant, show signs of improvement By Jim Puzzanghera Los Angeles Times Sep 5, 2016 0 WASHINGTON — For millions of Americans, a reminder of the economic damage of the 2007-09 recession has arrived every week or two for years — in their paychecks. Painfully slow wage growth has limited economic recovery, with many workers getting few if any raises. But there are signs that has started to change. The falling unemployment rate has led to more competition for workers, spurring solid gains in average hourly earnings in recent months. Those pressures, amplified by laws providing minimum-wage increases in California, New York and elsewhere, also are triggering changes for the workers who need raises the most. Beginning last year, large companies such as Wal-Mart, Starbucks, McDonald’s and JPMorgan Chase increased what they pay their lowest-level employees. “A pay increase is the right thing to do,” JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said recently in announcing raises that would bring the hourly pay of bank tellers, customer service representatives and other employees to at least $12 an hour in three years, from the current $10.15. “Wages for many Americans have gone nowhere for too long,” he wrote in a New York Times opinion article. The same message has emanated from the presidential campaigns of Republicans and Democrats. When adjusted for inflation, median annual household incomes declined to $53,657 in 2014, the most recent year for which government data are available, from $57,724 in 2000. “Household incomes are more than $4,000 lower than their levels in the year 2000,” Republican nominee Donald Trump said at a rally in Virginia last month. “Think of it … you’re making $4,000 less now than you did 16, 17 years ago.” Wage growth already was taking a hit this century for several reasons. One factor is the loss of bargaining power caused by a drop in the share of private-sector unionized workers; another is the decline in higher-paying manufacturing jobs as companies moved more factories abroad. As a result, the share of money flowing into households from wages began falling sharply compared with capital income from interest and dividends, according to a study last year by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. The 2008 financial crisis and the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression amplified those changes, further stifling overall wage growth. But after two years of strong job growth, job openings are near record levels. That’s forced employers to raise pay to attract new workers and retain existing ones, economists said. Average hourly earnings increased 2.4 percent for the 12 months ended Aug. 31. Annual wage gains have been consistently in that range since last fall — they reached a seven-year high of 2.7 percent year-over-year in July — an improvement from the tepid 2 percent during much the first six years of the recovery. With annual inflation running below 1 percent, the accelerating wage growth is boosting workers’ purchasing power. “We have turned the corner, and today the wage gains that are happening are far in excess of inflation,” said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at recruiting website Glassdoor. “As long as we keep seeing steady job gains in the monthly jobs report and near-record job openings, it’s inevitable we’re going to see wage growth pick up,” he said. Chamberlain said Glassdoor data show that competition for workers has pushed wage growth up sharply for some skilled professions. Pay for business system analysts is up about 10 percent compared with a year ago, while sales consultants saw a 7 percent gain and pharmacy technicians 6 percent. Many of those sales consultants are in the technology industry, which saw average wages rise 3.6 percent last year in the 10 top markets, including Silicon Valley, Seattle, New York City and Los Angeles, according to a report from financial and professional services firm JLL. In addition, more middle-income jobs are being created than was the case earlier in the economic recovery, indicating that wage gains are being spread more evenly among the workforce. From 2010 to 2013, new jobs that paid between about $30,000 and $50,000 annually lagged well behind high- and low-wage positions, according to research released recently by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But from 2013-15, the U.S. added about 2.3 million middle-income jobs in fields such as construction, education, and transportation. During the same period, the economy created about 1.5 million high-paying jobs and about 1.6 million low-paying jobs. Some states and localities have tried to accelerate wage recovery for low-income workers by raising minimum wages. There now are 29 states, plus the District of Columbia, that have minimum wages higher than the federal level of $7.25 an hour, which hasn’t budged since 2009. In April, California Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that will raise the minimum wage in California to $15 an hour by 2022. Also in April, New York enacted legislation that will raise the minimum wage there to $15. The increases vary by region — faster for New York City, slower for more rural areas — and it is unclear when the entire state will hit that level. As the states with the nation’s largest and third-largest populations moved to increase their minimum wages, large companies realized that they’d soon have to raise the pay of many of their workers. That was one factor behind the nationwide pay raises that several began announcing last year. “We certainly are mindful of wage increases in various states throughout the country,” McDonald’s chief financial officer Kevin M. Ozan said during an earnings call in July “It has, from a purely business standpoint, created an incentive to lift the wages at the bottom across their workforces,” said Christine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, which has been pushing for a $15-an-hour minimum wage. “A lot of companies … were getting a lot of bad press about how they treated their employees, and raising wages was an obvious way to respond to that,” she said. × Post a comment Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors. Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

JPMorgan Chase is strong and steady. Wells Fargo is seen as the best managed and most innovative. Joe Morgan via Wikipedia By James K. Glassman, Contributing Columnist From Kiplinger's Personal Finance, October 2016 UPDATE: In the column below that appeared in the October 2016 issue of Kiplinger’s Personal Finance, I recommended all four of the largest U.S. banks. One of those was Wells Fargo. Since then, Wells has been embroiled in what can only be called a disgusting scandal. The bank fired 5,300 employees for opening about 2 million fake accounts, going back to 2011, and has announced that CEO John Stumpf will forfeit about $45 million in compensation as a sort of punishment. Wells shares have dropped from $48 to $45 since I recommended them. Do I continue to recommend the stock? Absolutely not. Mistakes and individual misbehavior, I can tolerate, but systemic fraud, I can’t. It’s rarely an isolated event. Why own this tainted company when there are so many good ones out there? In normal times, banking is a nice business—not hugely profitable, but consistently so. Banks borrow money, mainly by taking deposits, and pay interest for the privilege. Then they turn around and lend that money to businesses, governments and individuals at a higher rate of interest. The difference between those two rates (after accounting for expenses such as rent and salaries) is a bank’s profit. For the past 30 years, that difference for U.S. banks has bounced between three and five percentage points. That might not sound like much, but with billions of dollars in deposits, serious money is involved. See Also: Is There a Bubble in Dividend Stocks? Advertisement For banks, the cost of borrowing money has been extremely low lately, as anyone with a savings account knows. But the price that banks get for lending money has been extremely low as well. A recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis found that the average net interest margin (NIM)—that is, the difference between the rate at which banks lend and borrow—for U.S. banks is about three percentage points, which is near a historical low. In 2008, the NIM was 3.3 percentage points, and in the early 1990s it was nearly five points. For the big banks, which compete vigorously for large corporate customers, today’s interest margin is even lower. At the end of June, JPMorgan Chase (symbol JPM), the nation’s largest bank, reported an NIM of just 2.25 points. A small rise in NIM goes a long way. With about $800 billion in loans, Chase would boost its after-tax profit by $8 billion—or by more than one-fourth of its 2015 earnings—if its NIM were to climb by one percentage point. Unfortunately for banks, they have little control over the rates at which they borrow; those are set by the Federal Reserve and the market as a whole. The Fed has been reluctant to raise rates in an economy that remains sluggish nearly eight years after the end of the Great Recession. Banks traditionally do have some influence over the rates they charge borrowers, but the primary way they can boost rates is by taking on riskier loans. Because of concerns about repeating the mistakes of the past, both banks and their regulators have become highly averse to assuming credit risk. Cream of the crop. Still, some banks have performed well in recent years. The best of them, such as JPMorgan Chase, have boosted the bottom line by increasing the size of their loan portfolio and by cutting expenses. Chase’s lending was up 16% for the 12-month period that ended June 30, and, although revenues actually declined between 2011 and 2015, profits rose by one-third, thanks to lower costs. Advertisement Chase’s shareholders have been rewarded. The stock has more than quadrupled since the dark days of 2009, and over the past five years it returned 12.0% annualized. That’s 1.4 percentage points per year lower than Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, but it’s not bad for a highly regulated business. A good chunk of that return has come from a steadily rising dividend. In 2009, Chase slashed its dividend rate from $1.52 per share annually to just 20 cents. Its annual payout, after a 10% increase over the summer, now stands at a record $1.92 per share, and the stock, at today’s price of $64, yields a brisk 3.0%. (All returns and prices are as of July 31.) All the big banks have shored up their balance sheets since the financial meltdown, and government regulators have kept them on a tight leash, discouraging the kinds of loans and trading activity that were routine in the past. There’s little room for the kind of risk-taking or bold investing that mark sectors such as technology. Chase’s “common equity tier 1” ratio, the key measure of the buffer against another disaster, has risen from 7% in 2007 to 11.9% as of June 30. That’s an achievement, but it hasn’t changed the status of Chase and the other too-big-to-fail banks as practically wards of the state. “Banks cannot be utilities,” Jamie Dimon, Chase’s CEO, wrote in the company’s 2015 annual report. Because of the understandable fears of government officials and the public, however, that’s just what the giant banks have become. Chase is the largest of the four banks that dominate commercial banking. The others are Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC), each with about $2 trillion in assets. Besides lending, they all advise on mergers and acquisitions (M&A), manage mutual funds, underwrite bond issues, and trade currencies and other investments for their own accounts. My list excludes Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), which perform many of the same functions as the others but are mainly investment banks, focusing on such activities as M&A and underwriting rather than collecting deposits and making small loans. Advertisement The banks have different personalities. Chase is strong and steady. Wells, whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, is seen as the best managed and most innovative. Its stock has been the top performer over the past five years, with an annualized return of 14.0%. BofA and Citigroup suffered more during the financial crisis and still haven’t fully recovered. Neither has been profitable enough to raise its dividend to anywhere near pre-financial-crisis levels. (Citi’s stock yields just 0.7%; BofA’s, 1.4%.) Once a proud and powerful global bank, Citi has drastically reduced its footprint. It now has retail bank offices in 21 countries, down from 50 in 2007; over the same period, it cut the number of U.S. branches from 936 to 780. A large portfolio of mortgage-backed securities still burdens BofA. Low interest rates encourage borrowers to refinance, which can be particularly problematic for holders of mortgage securities. The bank’s second-quarter earnings fell 18% from the same quarter in 2015, and its return on equity (a measure of profitability) is the lowest of the four. A key measure of how investors view banks is the relationship between their share prices and book value, or net worth on the balance sheet. The figure reflects investors’ take on the real value of a bank’s loans and other assets. Both Citi and BofA stocks trade for about 40% less than their book values. Chase trades almost precisely at book value, and Wells trades at a one-third premium to book value. Of course, these valuations are measures of how the market assesses the banks today. As an investor, your concern is what will happen tomorrow. I like the future of all four big-bank stocks. Higher interest rates, waiting in the wings, will be the catalyst that drives up their share prices. Higher rates will likely lead to wider net interest margins and thus higher profits. Banks can continue to cut costs by closing branches and deploying new technologies. And although I am generally averse to heavy regulation, the constraints on banks have been largely beneficial. Advertisement Banks below the top tier also look like good buys now. My favorite way to invest in the sector is through Fidelity Select Banking (FSRBX), an actively managed mutual fund in which the big four banks, led by Wells, at 10.2% of assets, are among the top six holdings. Another good choice is SPDR S&P Bank ETF (KBE), an exchange-traded fund with a portfolio comprising about 60 large banks, none accounting for more than 3% of assets. I also like Financial Select Sector SPDR (XLF), a more diversified ETF that, in addition to bank stocks, holds insurers, asset managers and even real estate investment trusts. Or you can skip the funds and simply put the same amount of money into each of the big four banks. It looks like the time is right. James K.

Duterte’s plan to sell his government’s first global bond is eliciting a tepid response from foreign investors as the nation’s existing dollar debt is the costliest in Asia. A series of credit-rating upgrades won during the six-year rule of his predecessor, Benigno S. C. Aquino III, saw the yield premium demanded by money managers to hold the notes over Treasuries shrink to the smallest among Asian sovereigns that issue dollar debt. Mr. Duterte’s administration, which took office following his landslide victory in a May election, plans to raise $500 million to plug next year’s budget deficit, according to Treasurer Roberto B. Tan. It’s also seeking at least P30 billion ($644 million) this month from retail investors. “Long gone are the days when the Philippines has to pay a premium on its bond,” said Edwin Gutierrez, the London-based head of emerging-market sovereign debt at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc, which oversees £301.4 billion ($401 billion). “We won’t get involved as the bonds simply have very little value.” While Aberdeen Asset and Standard Life Investments say the narrow premium on the bonds makes them too expensive, Union Investment Privatfonds GmbH sees a “rare” opportunity to buy the debt of Southeast Asia’s fastest-growing economy. The size of the proposed issuance by the Philippines is its smallest in at least two decades. The nation tapped the international market only once each year after staying away in 2013. The investors spoke before Friday’s bombing in the Mindanao city of Davao that killed 14 people. “Yes, we will look at the deal,” said Sergey Dergachev, a senior money manager at Union Investment in Frankfurt who helps oversee €13.5 billion ($15 billion). “The Philippines is a relatively rare issuer and fundamentally one of the strongest credits in Asia.” The small size of the planned sale also makes the “deal attractive in some way,” he added. The nation’s dollar bonds offer an extra yield of 95 basis points over Treasuries, according to indexes compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes. That compares with spreads of 238 in Indonesia, 207 in Malaysia and a premium of 204 for Asia. Philippine bonds have handed investors an 11% return so far in 2016, extending gains to a third year, JPMorgan indexes show. Sovereign debt in Indonesia and Malaysia has rebounded from losses in 2015 to earn 19% and 8.8%, respectively. After Friday’s bombing, Mr. Duterte declared a nationwide state of lawless violence, allowing him to use the military to assist the police to fight crime. The government will go ahead with selling retail debt on Tuesday, Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III said Saturday. Eduardo V. Francisco, president of BDO Capital & Investment Corp. which is one of the six banks in charge of the sale, is confident that the bombing won’t impact the issue. “The economy and the prospects are strong,” he said. A shrinking supply of global debt from Asia also burnishes the appeal of Philippine bonds. Dollar bond sales in the region, excluding Japan, have declined 9.1% to $107.3 billion this year through Sept. 5, according to Bloomberg-compiled data, as a weaker yuan and falling local borrowing costs prompted Chinese companies to raise funds domestically. “Getting exposure to Asian sovereign credit in hard currency in the primary market is by far the most liquid, cheapest and best opportunity to get the bonds,” said Mr. Dergachev. While Mr. Duterte’s administration prefers to fund its budget deficit with domestic debt, the government is well-positioned to tap the global bond market when the opportunity arises, Mr. Dominguez said last week. Though the Philippine government has yet to decide the timing of the proposed issuance, borrowers may rush to raise funds before the Federal Reserve increases interest rates. Issuers from Saudi Arabia to Russia and Brazil plan tens of billions of dollars in deals between September and US elections in early November. Mr. Duterte has asked Congress to expand the 2017 budget by 12% to $72 billion so he can fulfill key election promises to increase spending on the police, education and infrastructure. Domestic demand for Philippine dollar bonds has also played a key role in shrinking the yield premium, according to Standard Life. Local banks buy the notes to put to work money remitted by Filipinos working overseas equivalent to about 9% of GDP. The proposed $500-million issue will replace a similar amount of maturing debt next year, so there will be competition for the securities, according to Kieran Curtis, the London-based investment director for emerging-market debt at Standard Life, which oversees $360 billion. “We generally consider that spreads are too tight in Philippine bonds to offer an attractive return,” Mr. Curtis said. “It wouldn’t be high on our priority list right now.” -- Bloomberg E-mail | Print |     From / email :     To :     E-mail (required) :     Message :     Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.    MORE STORIES Fitch adds to warnings of Trump policy impact SEC OK’s Shakey’s IPO, SMIC debt sale Philippines leads Asia growth in Q3 Hot money’ rebounds to net inflow in October Bangladesh team to seek return of rest of cyber loot Duterte gov't gets top marks for drug war, human rights HSBC: political fears to weigh on peso Q2 GDP growth intact despite changes Paddy rice output could be lowest in three years Surprise farm growth boosts GDP hopes    MOST READ    MOST E-MAILED 1.

Throsby will also run Barclays' investment banking business within that division, the sources said, filling the gap left by the departure in March of Tom King. Staley has been running the division himself while the bank searched for a replacement. Spokeswomen for Barclays and JPMorgan declined to comment because the announcement is not yet public. King's departure came as Staley announced the creation of Barclays' corporate and international division as part of a new 'transatlantic' strategy focused on the United States and Britain. The new strategy saw the bank divided into two units, Barclays UK and Barclays Corporate and International, to comply with ring-fencing regulations aimed at safeguarding its retail banking business from riskier operations. Barclays' shares are down 20 percent so far this year, after suffering their worst single-day drop on record following Britain's vote to exit the EU on June 23. Throsby joined JPMorgan in 2010 as global head of equity derivatives before being promoted to global head of equities in September 2012. He joins a number of JPMorgan alumni recruited by Staley, who was himself CEO of the U.S. lender's investment bank before joining Barclays in December last year. Former JPMorgan bankers now in senior roles at Barclays include finance director Tushar Morzaria, chief information officer Mark Ashton-Rigby, chief operating officer Paul Compton, and chief risk officer CS Venkatakrishnan.

Throsby, 50, will take on the role in January, subject to regulatory approvals, Barclays said in a statement Monday, a day after Bloomberg News reported the bank’s plans to hire the executive. Throsby joined JPMorgan in 2010 and was named global head of equities two years later, running the business from London. Before joining Barclays in December, Staley spent more than three decades at JPMorgan and has recruited extensively from the U.S. firm as he reshaped his senior management team. Throsby will join other senior alumni on the executive committee including Chief Risk Officer C.S. “Venkat” Venkatakrishnan and Chief Operating Officer Paul Compton, who were hired earlier this year. “Turning around the investment bank is a massive job, but the good news is that he’s got a boss who understands what’s going on, and he’s fortunate to be coming in after a lot of the bad stuff has been dealt with,” said Christopher Wheeler, an analyst at Atlantic Equities. “Staley keeps going back to drink at the same trough: JPMorgan has a deep bench, but it’s still painful for Jamie Dimon to keep losing these people to Jes.” A spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to comment. Profitability Challenge Staley is relying on Throsby to shore up the performance of the investment bank, which has been criticized by investors for its low profitability, billions in misconduct fines and a drop in trading revenue as European growth falters. The CEO has described calls to exit the business as “shortsighted,” but has pared its scope, closing offices in seven Asian countries, Brazil and Moscow, and removing an additional 1,200 jobs.  The new securities chief will also have to navigate the fallout from Brexit and the potential loss of the U.K.’s passporting rights, which allow investment banks to sell their services across the European Union and are a cornerstone of the City of London’s success. The investment bank has been without a head since Tom King left in March, when Barclays was split in two to comply with British rules requiring the separation of banks’ consumer and trading operations.  Throsby’s History As head of the new corporate and international division, Throsby will also oversee the wealth management and U.S. and German credit-card businesses. Staley has been directly responsible for the securities unit since King’s departure, assisted by deputy-head Joe Gold, who is retiring in the coming months to pursue interests outside banking, despite being offered other roles at Barclays, according to a memo sent to staff Monday. Ashok Vaswani leads the ringfenced retail unit, Barclays U.K.  For more on new appointments at Barclays’s investment bank, click here Throsby, who is Australian and attended the universities of Sydney and Oxford, England, started his career at Macquarie Group Ltd. and worked at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Citadel LLC before joining JPMorgan as global head of equity derivatives in 2010. Staley was running JPMorgan’s investment bank then, making this the second time he’s hired Throsby. Throsby helped boost JPMorgan’s equities trading revenue from $4.45 billion in 2012 to $5.69 billion last year. Barclays’ equities revenue has declined over the same timeframe, according to data from Bloomberg Intelligence. “The team Jes has assembled at least is coherent in their JPMorgan background, which is a positive,” said Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Chirantan Barua. “But then Tim joins straight in the middle of a slump and goes into a bank that hasn’t got out of capital problems as yet.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

coils and coatings to HVAC&R industry News provided by Modine Manufacturing Company Sep 06, 2016, 18:45 ET Share this article RACINE, Wis., Sept. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Modine Manufacturing Company (NYSE: MOD), a diversified global leader in thermal management technology and solutions, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Luvata Heat Transfer Solutions (HTS) for a total consideration of approximately $422 million, to be financed through a combination of cash, debt, and $25 million of Modine common stock. Modine expects the transaction to close within calendar year 2016, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory review. Highlights: Addresses "Diversify" and "Grow" commitments in Modine's transformational strategy, announced in October 2015 Increases Modine's industrial business portfolio to approximately 40% of sales Further leverages Modine's expertise in the global HVAC&R markets Broadens Modine's customer base and reduces cyclical exposure Expands margin and growth profile of the Company Delivers immediate accretive value to EPS before the expected benefit of approximately $15 million of cost synergies "We are excited to announce that we have taken the next step in our transformational Strengthen, Diversify and Grow corporate strategy through the upcoming addition of Luvata HTS," said Modine President and Chief Executive Officer, Thomas A. Burke. "Luvata HTS is the largest independent producer of HVAC&R coils and coatings globally. They bring an innovative culture and broad product offering that are highly complementary to Modine. Further, they bring a global footprint with manufacturing facilities spread over three continents, all of which are supported by best in class sales, engineering and support teams. Most importantly, the addition of Luvata HTS helps to expand our margin profile and future growth opportunities. We look forward to welcoming the Luvata HTS team to our family." Luvata HTS is a leading manufacturer of commercial and industrial coils, coolers and related products, primarily for the HVAC&R markets. Luvata HTS's product offering covers a broad range of heat exchanger coils, commercial refrigeration and industrial coolers, complemented by anti-corrosion coating solutions. In addition, Luvata HTS is a significant player in the power generation and transformer cooler markets due to strong relationships with European OEMs. Luvata HTS has a highly diversified customer base with strong and long-standing relationships. With agile manufacturing capabilities in North America, Europe, and Asia, the company has a proven ability to attract and serve a wide range of customers across several industrial markets. In 2015, Luvata HTS had net sales of roughly $530 million and EBITDA of $59 million.  Dennis Appel, Luvata HTS President added, "Luvata and its owners are proud to have taken this important step toward combining the HTS Division with Modine, another proven industry leader and a true innovator in our industry. With Modine we are well positioned to continue our growth and be a part of a company that shares our passion for innovation and commitment to integrity. I am confident that together, we will provide even stronger service and solutions for our customers around the globe." Burke concluded, "We examined several interesting acquisition opportunities as part of our strategic review process, but Luvata HTS was the most logical and compelling fit. While the company already operates a fairly lean enterprise, we do expect to achieve annual cost synergies of roughly $15 million within the first three to four years, in particular through the ongoing optimization of manufacturing and procurement organizations and cost structures. We also believe revenue synergies will emerge as we look to sell Luvata HTS's products into Modine's broad client base, utilize Luvata HTS's sales team to sell Modine's coil and other products into Luvata HTS's client base, and pursue other larger geographic and adjacent product line opportunities in the future." J.P. Morgan Securities LLC serves as Modine's exclusive financial advisor and Kirkland & Ellis serves as Modine's primary legal advisor.

(Photo: Richard Drew, AP) WASHINGTON — A 1993 tax reform under President Clinton capped the deductibility of executive compensation at $1 million a year. And the 2008 bank bailout banned large bonuses to executives at those financial institutions getting taxpayer loans. So how did the chief executive of Wells Fargo, John Stumpf, collect $155 million in “performance” pay between 2012 and 2015 even as the bank he runs paid more than $10 billion in penalties for various acts of misconduct? Nor was he alone among bank CEOs getting massive payouts in the post-crisis period. JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon, for instance, cashed in $23 million in stock compensation in 2010, as the bank’s stock was down 15% from pre-crisis levels in the midst of the foreclosure crisis. The firm would go on to pay more than $28 billion to settle charges of misconduct in mortgages and other transactions. These massive bonus payouts benefited from a loophole in that 1993 rule that allowed companies to still take tax deductions for stock options and other “performance” bonuses. The loophole not only allowed board members to continue outsize compensation for the chief executives who appointed them but, as the Institute for Policy Studies said last week in releasing a new report, “fueled an explosion in CEO pay.” While the bank bailout itself blocked this type of compensation, the ban lasted only until the banks repaid the bailout loans. Of course they rushed to pay these loans back, even if it meant borrowing other funds in the private market. So even as shareholders, let alone clients, continued to suffer the consequences of bad bank management, these CEOs collected huge bonuses subsidized by taxpayers. The tax subsidy alone for that $155 million Stumpf received, IPS calculates, was $54 million. Between 2010 and 2015, IPS found, the top executives at 20 leading banks collected nearly $800 million in pay still eligible for tax deductions under this loophole because they were related to performance targets like total shareholder return. This was well before shareholders saw the stock price return to its pre-crisis level. “These forms of compensation are supposed to ensure ‘pay for performance,’” the IPS study says. “In reality, they have encouraged the kind of reckless behavior that caused the 2008 crisis by creating the potential for unlimited jackpots with little downside risk.” In fact, because this loophole enables a company to reduce its overall tax bill with these generous payouts, the study notes, “it has served as a perverse incentive for excessive pay.” And this excessive compensation quickly resumed after the crash as those 20 banks were paying out more than $128 billion in fines for financial misconduct. The ban on performance pay in the bank bailout was far too short, the IPS says, because the bailout itself enabled the executives to benefit from the windfall of taxpayer support. “In effect, those most responsible for the crash were best-positioned to rebound,” the study says. The Washington-based think tank, which produces an annual report on excessive executive pay, urged Congress to close this loophole with legislation already introduced in the House and Senate that would simply eliminate the exemption for performance pay and cap tax deductibility for all forms of compensation at $1 million. Specifically with regard to Wall Street, the IPS study says, regulators could also move toward tougher implementation of a provision in the Dodd-Frank financial reform that allows them to ban bonuses that encourage excessive risk-taking. In a comment letter on the rule sent to bank regulators earlier this summer, IPS project director Sarah Anderson said the restrictions imposed so far — such as a short deferral of performance compensation or provisions for clawbacks — were too weak. In general, the IPS study says, regulations should encourage narrower gaps in pay between the CEO and average worker and bigger rewards for longer term goals to discourage “short termism.” The IPS statement notes that Hillary Clinton, early in her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination last year, pledged to “reform” executive compensation to eliminate these short-term incentives, but she has not explicitly said she would close the tax loophole for performance bonuses. However, closing the loophole would be a way, the IPS authors suggest, to correct the “1993 policy mistake” by President Clinton that “costs taxpayers billions of dollars per year and perpetuates the reckless Wall Street bonus culture.” Loopholes like this don’t happen by accident. Bill Clinton’s labor secretary, Robert Reich, has since related that he was the sole person to object when other economic advisers encouraged the new president to exempt performance-related compensation as he fulfilled his campaign pledge to limit tax deductibility on executive pay. The result has been the explosion in CEO bonuses and widening of the gap between executive and worker pay. “As income inequality continues to rise,” IPS’s Anderson, co-author of the new report, urged in a Politico op-ed last week, “Hillary Clinton must fix her husband’s mistake and close this egregious loophole.” 102 CONNECTTWEET 21 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2c5u1ZW

Wall Street Re-Engineers the CD -- and Returns Suffer The Wall Street Journal. 9/6/2016 Jean Eaglesham, Sarah Krouse, Ben Eisen © Whitney Curtis for The Wall Street Journal Mary Bailey, a 79-year-old widow in Arlington, Mass., made a big deposit for her grandchildren at her Citizens Bank branch when a financial adviser there sold her on a newfangled $100,000 certificate of deposit. It would, he said, double her savings in six years, according to a later state enforcement action. Quotes in the article CDS Co Ltd 2169 ▼ 961.00 -3.00 -0.31% Barclays PLC BCS ▼ 10.42 -0.14 -1.28% Bankrate Inc RATE ▲ 10.55 +0.35 +3.43% Citizens Financial Group Inc CFG ▲ 32.05 +0.32 +1.01% So she was irate when her first statement showed the CD’s value had fallen to $95,712, thanks to upfront fees. “This was not a CD as I know a CD,” Ms. Bailey says. Traditional certificates of deposit offer better interest rates than normal savings accounts for customers who agree to lock up funds for a period of time. Since the 1960s, they have been among the most popular products retail banks offer. Now Wall Street has re-engineered the most bread-and-butter of investments in a way that leaves many investors with lower returns, and facing losses if they have to cash out early. Returns on such CDs, known as market-linked or structured CDs, depend on the performance of a basket of stocks or other assets instead of a flat interest rate. CD holders get their original money back when the CD matures, usually after three to 10 years, plus a return based on the performance of certain assets or benchmarks. Most issuers of such CDs don’t publicly disclose any performance data, so it is difficult for would-be investors to assess how good a deal the products are. The Wall Street Journal obtained from an investment adviser returns data on hundreds of market-linked CDs created by Barclays PLC, a leading player. The data show that many underperformed conventional CDs, in part because their design puts a limit on the upside from gains in the underlying assets. Of the 325 Barclays CDs reviewed by the Journal, 239 had announced at least one annual return payment. More than half of those returns were lower than an investor would have earned from an average five-year conventional CD. Of the 118 structured CDs that were issued at least three years ago, only one-quarter posted returns better than those of an average five-year conventional CD. And roughly one-quarter produced no returns at all as of June 2016. A Journal analysis of 147 market-linked CDs issued since 2010 by Bank of the West, part of French bank BNP Paribas SA, revealed a similar pattern. Sixty-two percent produced returns lower than an investor would have received from a five-year conventional CD, while almost a quarter have yet to pay any return at all, the analysis found. A Barclays spokesman said in a written statement the structured CDs market has “seen significant evolution over the last few years to meet the needs of clients, investors and distributors seeking to navigate the continued challenges of a low interest rate environment.” A spokeswoman for BNP Paribas declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Citizens Financial Group Inc., whose bank sold the CD to Ms. Bailey, said it takes “very seriously” its “responsibility to help customers make informed decisions.” She declined to comment on individual customers. The unusual CDs have been around in some form since the 1980s, but sales have taken off since the financial crisis. That is partly because, at a time of rock-bottom interest rates, investors have been desperate to find anything that appears it might generate higher yields. Banks, for their part, are looking for inexpensive sources of funding. In addition, such CDs generate fees. Fee income, in particular, has been hard hit, leaving banks looking for new products yielding more than conventional savings accounts and CDs. Market-linked CDs don’t have to be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, so there are no official sales data. Bankers and other experts on the product estimate sales of $5 to $15 billion a year. U.S. investors held about $22.7 billion of market-linked CDs last month, up 36% from 2012, according to StructuredRetailProducts.com. The CDs are sold to customers of regional banks and brokerages by bankers and brokers, who receive commissions. Brokers say each month they receive lists of new market-linked CDs created by Wall Street firms, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Barclays and others. James Maher, chief executive of Swansea, Ill.-based Archford Capital Strategies LLC, invested $30,000 in a five-year market-linked CD from Bank of America Corp. in 2009 to save for his son’s college tuition. The CD tracked the performance of the S&P 500, paying a return of 61% of any increase in that index. Mr. Maher says he knows he would have earned more by investing directly in the stock market, but he liked the security of the product. “This was money I wanted to know for sure was there,” he says. He made $18,300 on the investment, he says. Typically, everyone in the sales chain—a wholesale broker, a financial adviser and a bank teller—gets paid more for selling a market-linked CD than a conventional CD or a mutual fund. The adviser who actually sells the CD, for example, can get commissions of up to 3% of the CD’s value, according to information sent to brokers reviewed by the Journal. “Banks have to be delighted with these structured products.” said Steve Swidler, a finance professor at Auburn University. “There’s virtually no risk to them, and [the banks] sit back and rake in fees.” The Barclays CDs reviewed by the Journal generally are linked to underlying “baskets” of five, 10 or 20 stocks. Most pay income based on an “adjusted” version of the basket’s actual return, calculated by applying a cap and floor to each stock’s performance. Suppose a basket of 10 stocks has a cap of 5% and a floor of 20%. If eight of the stocks go up 20% and two go down 20%, the average actual performance would be 12%. But because each increase is capped at 5%, while up to 20% of each decrease is counted, the adjusted average performance is zero—a much worse return for the customer. For the 247 Barclays CDs analyzed by the Journal that used this method, the adjusted overall stock performance tended to be worse—on average, 28 percentage points lower—than the actual performance of the underlying stocks. Investors in the CDs also forfeit the dividends they would have received by owning the stocks outright. Investors who withdraw money early risk losing a slice of their principal. The most common penalty for early withdrawal from a conventional five-year CD is a year’s interest, according to Bankrate.com. One Barclays six-year CD due to mature in October is based on 20 stocks. The shares’ average values had more than doubled as of June. But the CD was designed to cap positive returns at 6% and negative returns at 30%. That translated into an adjusted performance of negative 4% for the whole basket. As a result, four of the annual coupons the CD has paid were zero. A fifth was 0.04%. That means a $100,000 deposit would have generated a $40 return over five years. A conventional five-year CD, by contrast, would have generated an average of $8,100 in interest, according to Bankrate.com. Other structured CDs from Barclays and other issuers fared better, including some that track a stock index. Comparing market-linked CDs can be difficult. Analyzing the potential performance of the underlying assets, and how that will be affected by the CD’s design, is nearly impossible for most prospective customers, as well as many financial advisers, according to industry experts. “I’ve worked in the kitchen and seen how it’s made, so I’m not interested in consuming them,” says Keith Amburgey, who used to design market-linked CDs at Morgan Stanley and now runs Tampa-based financial advisory firm Rutherford Asset Planning. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. One series of CDs from HSBC Holdings PLC is called “Industry Titans” because the instruments are pegged to brand-name stocks. The 10 stocks underpinning a 2012 version of the CD, including Tiffany & Co. and ConAgra Foods Inc., were up by 46%, on average, at the end of July, according to FactSet. But a 6% cap on positive returns and a 30% floor on negative ones reduced the CD’s adjusted performance, which determines the amount paid to the investor, to negative 1.1%. The CD paid a zero return in July, for the fourth year in a row, according to HSBC. “We stand behind our market-linked CDs as an investment option suitable for a variety of customers,” said an HSBC spokeswoman. The CDs protect principal if held to maturity, unlike direct investment in equities, she said, and the investment risks are disclosed in detail in marketing brochures. In 2013, a broker at Fifth Third Securities Inc. advised an 88-year-old customer to put about $200,000 from his retirement account, nearly 80% of the total, into market-linked CDs, according to the customer’s lawyer, Howard Rosenfield of Farmington, Conn. The investor had to sell the CDs early, in part to make the minimum withdrawals required under retirement-account rules—a cash need that was foreseeable at the time Fifth Third sold him the CDs, Mr. Rosenfield says. His client lost more than $20,000 on the sales. Fifth Third Securities last year agreed to a confidential settlement. A spokesman for parent company Fifth Third Bancorp declined to comment. Ms. Bailey, the Citizens Bank customer in Massachusetts, had sold a condo in Maine in 2013, a year after the death of her husband, who she says had handled their finances. She went to a Citizens branch in Arlington, a suburb of Boston, to deposit the money. She says bank employees pressured her not to just park the money in a savings account. She says she was directed to Citizens broker Andrew Jurkunas, who steered her to a CD called the GS Momentum Builder Multi-Asset 5 ER Index-Linked Certificate of Deposit Due 2021. It is one of a series of CDs based on a Goldman Sachs-designed index that tracks the performance of up to 14 exchange-traded funds and a cash-like holding. The index aggregates the performance of different combinations of some or all of the underlying funds, relying on a complex formula designed to smooth volatility. When the CD matures, customers get back their principal, plus a payout that is up to double the return achieved by the Goldman index. That return is reduced by an annual fee and other costs. Documents related to the CD, including a description of the methodology behind the Goldman index, run to 266 pages and feature calculus, hypothetical backtested data and flowcharts. Ms. Bailey says she didn’t read the documents. She says she told Mr. Jurkunas she didn’t want to take any risks. She relied on his advice. He jotted a note on a sheet summarizing the Goldman index: “CD 200%,” according to documents reviewed by the Journal. Mr. Jurkunas hung up when called by the Journal and didn’t respond to subsequent requests for comment. A spokeswoman for Goldman, which hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing in relation to the case, said the bank was “not a party in the customer’s complaint or settlement, and had no direct relationship with the investor” and that the product’s risks were “clearly explained” in its documents. When Ms. Bailey received her first statement showing that the value of her CD had dropped by more than $4,000, she complained to Massachusetts state securities regulators. This January, the office filed civil charges against the bank alleging that Mr. Jurkunas, who wasn’t named or accused of wrongdoing, didn’t adequately disclose the risks of the market-linked CD. A month later, Citizens agreed to refund Ms. Bailey her full $100,000 deposit, plus interest, as part of a broader settlement in which it didn’t admit wrongdoing.

It could rank as one of the biggest corporate cyberattacks. Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript They've got your name, your birthday, your email and street addresses, even your social security number. Health insurer Anthem says hackers broke into its computers and stole that data on up to 80 million people. It could rank as one of the largest cyber breaches against a company. The hackers accessed data on current and former customers as well as Anthem's own employees, including that of its CEO, Joseph Swedish. He called it a "very sophisticated cyber attack." Security firm Cylance CEO Stuart McClure said, "That information is a treasure trove for cybercriminals. It can easily be sold on underground markets within hours and used for a wide variety of identity fraud schemes." The hackers didn't get credit card or medical info. But what sets this case apart is its scale and speed. Compare that to the cyberattacks on JPMorgan, which exposed records on 76 million households; at Home Depot, 56 million payment cards. Anthem, formerly known as WellPoint, is the second largest U.S. health insurer. It operates under the Blue Cross Blue Shield name in many states as well as UniCare and Amerigroup in others. Anthem acted fast, announcing the breach just days after its employees identified the attack. JPMorgan Chase, by contrast, took weeks before its disclosure. Anthem says it doesn't expect the breach to affect its 2015 financial outlook. But McClure says it typically costs health insurers at least $100 per stolen record to clean up such an attack. Anthem's stock has shot up more than 60 percent in the last 12 months, but it gave up some of those gains in early trading.
