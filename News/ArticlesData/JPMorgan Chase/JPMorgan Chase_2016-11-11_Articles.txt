"Following" : "Follow"}} November 11, 2016 12:44pm   Comments Share: Related ADM Choose Your News: Earnings, Fed, Oil, And Retail Sales Highlight Busy Day 18 Stocks Moving In Monday's Pre-Market Session The Vetr community has downgraded $ADM to 2.5-Stars (Vetr) Shares of Archer Daniels Midland Company (NYSE: ADM) were down 7 percent after JPMorgan downgraded it to Underweight, citing Donald Trump’s surprise victory could have significant implications for the agriculture sector. “[T]he full impact of the Presidential election result is hard to quantify at this point; however, we believe that the risks to US agriculture are now skewed to the downside,” analyst Ann Duignan wrote in a note. Duigan believes a strong U.S. dollar versus South American currencies would weigh on Ag services and may reduce the competitiveness of U.S. exports. In addition, the competition for North American exports may increase earlier in 2017 as Brazilian farmers have been planting the 2016/2017 crop at a faster pace. The analyst also noted that corn processing could be hurt by a weaker Mexican peso. Further, weaker economic growth could negatively impact exports into Mexico, which is the third largest export market for US agriculture. “[T]he value of ADM’s ethanol dry mill assets could be reduced given heightened risks to demand (domestically and in terms of exports), this could negatively impact ADM’s ability to sell the dry mill assets in the near term,” Duigan highlighted. Meanwhile, the expiry of biodiesel tax incentive at the end of 2016 may weigh on soybean crush margins into 2017. The company expects up to $50 million negative impact on EBIT. Duigan also cut the price target by $6 to $36 on the shares, which lost 5.2 percent in the last two days. The analyst expects the stock to be under continued pressure as the impact of actual policy starts to weigh on the company’s core businesses.

By: Reuters | Published:November 11, 2016 7:41 am A person familiar with Trump’s personnel efforts said the transition team’s list included Dimon, Mnuchin and Rep. Jeb Hensarling. (Source: File/AP) JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon did not support Republican Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, yet some Trump advisers want America’s most famous banker to become Treasury Secretary to calm nerves on Wall Street. A member of Trump’s transition team contacted Dimon recently to see if he would be interested in the role, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. It was not clear whether Dimon had responded, though he has said emphatically multiple times that he was not interested in the role. JPMorgan spokesman Andrew Gray declined to comment, and Dimon, who is traveling outside the United States, could not be reached. Trump’s close circle of advisers includes several with Wall Street ties. His campaign finance manager, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker. Fundraiser Anthony Scaramucci is a hedge fund executive. A person familiar with Trump’s personnel efforts said the transition team’s list included Dimon, Mnuchin and Rep. Jeb Hensarling. The person said that Mnuchin was a more likely choice given his proximity to Trump. Trump’s controversial rhetoric and behavior during the campaign concerning immigrants, women, minorities, the disabled, Muslims and China, among other things, were offensive to many senior Wall Street executives who have tried to embrace inclusion, diversity and globalization. Trump also criticized Wall Street on the trail, saying the industry “got away with murder” and would not be let off the hook. Since being elected on Tuesday, Trump has softened his tone and tried to bridge gaps by meeting with President Obama and taking calls from foreign officials. Bringing Dimon on board could help him mend fences with the financial industry, which appears to be coming around to the idea of Trump in the White House. At an event on Thursday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc CEO Lloyd Blankfein said Trump could be good for the economy and Dimon would be an excellent choice for Treasury Secretary, while hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said Trump’s advisers would get “the best and brightest” to run the economy. Hensarling’s office indicated in a statement that he did not want the job. “Serving in his Cabinet is not something I’ve indicated an interest in and it’s not something I am pursuing,” the statement said. He said he looked forward to working in Congress to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act which tightened regulations on Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis. Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has been floated as a possible candidate for roles like Treasury Secretary in the past. However, resentment toward bankers following the 2007-2009 financial crisis made his candidacy much less likely, as did JPMorgan-specific scandals related to a costly derivatives trade and bad mortgages. A $13 billion mortgage settlement JPMorgan reached with the federal government in 2013 prompted Trump then to call Dimon “the worst banker in the United States.” However, Dimon has managed to retain a reputation within the banking industry as a distinguished leader, in part by the way he handled those scandals and the way he talks about JPMorgan’s role in society as the largest U.S. bank. For instance, Dimon decided to have JPMorgan make big investments in Detroit, calling it a civic duty to turn around an economically challenged city. His memos, speeches and letters to shareholders are often sprinkled with patriotic language. “America is best when we come together with clear leadership, expertise and the political will to take on difficult challenges and get things done,” the 60-year-old chairman and CEO said in a memo to JPMorgan Chase employees following Tuesday’s election. “No one should ever doubt the strength and resilience of our country and our democracy.” However, Dimon has said as recently as September that he would not want a role as Treasury Secretary. If he holds to that, it could put him and JPMorgan in an awkward position. Saying “no” to a presidential request to join the cabinet is unusual, and the bank would then be overseen by appointees from an administration Dimon rejected. Even so, his associates do not expect Dimon to say “yes.” Dimon has said his determination to act would make it hard to make political compromises. Talking before an audience in September, he said the only job in government he would want is the one Trump is about to get. “I would love to be president of the United States of America,” Dimon told the Economic Club of Washington. “Until Donald Trump got to where he was, they said you’ll never see a rich businessman who’s never been in politics be president. I clearly was wrong about that.” Best of Express 26/11 Stories of Strength presented by The Indian Express, Facebook & Instagram IndiaParliament winter session starts today: Opposition sees red in black & white IndiaBirla text message shows payoff to ‘Gujarat CM’ in 2012, says Arvind Kejriwal BusinessDemonetisation: SBI report had clues to possible currency pullback in March IndiaDemonetisation: Indelible ink to prevent repeat withdrawals but how isn’t clear IndiaGovernment bans Zakir Naik’s IRF for five years EntertainmentDear Zindagi Take 4: Shah Rukh Khan tells Alia Bhatt why we can't love freely and makes a lot of sense, watch video EntertainmentOh Oh Jaane Jaana singer Kamaal Khan resurfaces on Salman Khan's Twitter, see pics EntertainmentTwinkle Khanna asked Karan Johar full form of MNS, his reply will make you forget Koffee With Karan EntertainmentSkin show is not necessarily sexy, says Alia Bhatt.

A member of Trump's transition team contacted Dimon recently to see if he would be interested in the role, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. It was not clear whether Dimon had responded, though he has said emphatically multiple times that he was not interested in the role. JPMorgan spokesman Andrew Gray declined to comment, and Dimon, who is travelling outside the United States, could not be reached. Trump's close circle of advisers includes several with Wall Street ties. His campaign finance manager, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker. Fundraiser Anthony Scaramucci is a hedge fund executive. A person familiar with Trump's personnel efforts said the transition team's list included Dimon, Mnuchin and Rep. Jeb Hensarling. The person said that Mnuchin was a more likely choice given his proximity to Trump. Trump's controversial rhetoric and behaviour during the campaign concerning immigrants, women, minorities, the disabled, Muslims and China, among other things, were offensive to many senior Wall Street executives who have tried to embrace inclusion, diversity and globalization. Trump also criticized Wall Street on the trail, saying the industry "got away with murder" and would not be let off the hook. Since being elected on Tuesday, Trump has softened his tone and tried to bridge gaps by meeting with President Obama and taking calls from foreign officials. Bringing Dimon on board could help him mend fences with the financial industry, which appears to be coming around to the idea of Trump in the White House.

BUSINESS COMPANY TOWN Film financier and Wall Street executive Steven Mnuchin a leading candidate for Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin is a leading candidate for Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, 53, served as national finance chairman of Trump's campaign. Steven Mnuchin, 53, served as national finance chairman of Trump's campaign. Daniel Miller and James Rufus Koren Much of liberal Hollywood may be lamenting the prospect of a Donald Trump presidency, but one prominent industry player could wind up getting a high-profile position in the new administration. Steven Mnuchin, 53, a wealthy Wall Street executive and successful film financier who served as the national finance chairman of Trump’s campaign, is widely considered one of the leading contenders to become the next Treasury secretary, along with Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas), head of the House Committee on Financial Services, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. Mnuchin, chief executive of New York-based hedge fund Dune Capital Management, spent 17 years early in his career at Goldman Sachs, where he was a partner and eventually chief information officer, before leaving in 2002. He then started an investment fund with billionaire investor George Soros, a prominent Hillary Clinton supporter, before co-founding Dune. Mnuchin, along with other investors, made a windfall after purchasing the failed bank IndyMac in 2009 in the wake of the financial crisis, and selling it for a substantial profit in 2015. In addition, Mnuchin has long been a financial backer of high-profile movies, most recently the August hit “Suicide Squad,” a dark comic book film from Warner Bros. that grossed nearly $750 million worldwide. Via Dune, Mnuchin has cut slate financing deals with 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. over the years, leading to his executive producing credits on several critical and commercial hits, including “American Sniper” and “Mad Max: Fury Road.”  But some of his business associations have been controversial, including dealings with the once high-flying film and TV studio Relativity Media and OneWest Bank, which he and others created out of the assets of IndyMac. Mnuchin, a divorced father of three children, owns a $26.5 million mansion in Bel Air and previously lived at New York’s 740 Park Avenue, a tony cooperative apartment building, according to public records and news reports. In 2011, the lawn of his 22,000-square-foot L.A. residence was the site of demonstrations by dozens of “Make Banks Pay” activists, including a foreclosed homeowner whose loan was serviced by OneWest, which had drawn scrutiny for its eviction tactics.

As president, he could get to quickly reshape it — and the economic conditions that central bank policymakers will be facing. Trump will have the opportunity to appoint as many as five new members to the seven-person... (Jim Puzzanghera and Don Lee) Mnuchin, who was named Friday to Trump’s Presidential Transition Team, did not respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment. Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not respond to requests for comment. Few people in the entertainment industry whose business has intersected with Mnuchin were willing to speak about him after Tuesday’s election. Those that would talk about Mnuchin described him as smart, savvy and serious.  Jon Landau, who produced Fox’s “Avatar,” got to know Mnuchin during the making of the blockbuster 2009 film, which the businessman helped finance. Typical of a financier, Mnuchin did not have a hands-on role in the making of the movie, Landau said. But in their limited dealings Mnuchin was a “smart, personable guy.”   “He has certainly proven himself in the business world,” said Landau, who has attended Los Angeles Lakers games with Mnuchin over the years. Entertainment industry attorney Peter Dekom, who had a preliminary meeting about a prospective film financing pact with Mnuchin earlier this year, said he “understands the finance side of Hollywood as well as anyone.” But unlike many in Hollywood, Mnuchin is said to avoid the limelight. Lionel Chetwynd, a filmmaker who co-founded Friends of Abe, a group for Hollywood conservatives, called Mnuchin “a very sober individual.” He said he’d met the financier at black-tie functions over the years. “He’s not Mark Cuban,” said Chetwynd, referring to the flamboyant billionaire investor. “There are people who operate in Hollywood but who do so in a very pristine manner, who don’t show up every night at the right restaurants, and he would be one of those. Not flashy people, but very solid business people whose interests stretch very far beyond movies and movie stars.” Mnuchin has East Coast pedigree. The Yale University graduate grew up in a powerful New York family: He is the son of Robert Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker who became a prominent Manhattan art gallerist, and the late Elaine Cooper, a former vice president of the International Directors Council of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. And Mnuchin’s brother, Alan, worked at Goldman Sachs and Lehman Bros. before founding his own investment advisory firm, AGM Partners. Despite Mnuchin’s New York business credentials, one of his most notable financial bonanzas came via a regional commercial bank based in sleepy Pasadena. Mnuchin and other wealthy investors, including Michael Dell and a hedge fund run by Soros, bought failed IndyMac in March 2009, putting up about $1.6 billion in cash and renaming it OneWest Bank. Investors bought the bank’s assets at a bargain price, and also arranged a deal whereby the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which had seized the savings and loan in mid-2008, agreed to cover as much as 75% of the losses from IndyMac’s already discounted loan portfolio. The FDIC often agrees to such deals when trying to sell a failed lender, but bank analyst Bert Ely said the insurer gave Mnuchin’s group a particularly sweet deal. “It was certainly richer than average,” he said of the arrangement, describing it as a combination of good deal-making by Mnuchin and bad decision-making by the FDIC. The insurer, Ely said, seemed keen on keeping IndyMac an independent institution and did not want to sell it to another big bank. “I’m certainly not going to be critical of Mnuchin,” Ely added. “He took advantage of what I think was a bad policy decision by the FDIC. The deal was as sweet as it was because the FDIC limited the field of potential acquirers.” Mnuchin and other investors sold OneWest to New Jersey lender CIT Group last year for $3.4 billion. The deal was delayed — and nearly derailed — by complaints about OneWest’s foreclosure practices. As part of its arrangement with the FDIC, Mnuchin’s group had agreed to participate in a mortgage-modification program, but community groups charged that the bank was aggressive when it came to foreclosing on homeowners. The California Reinvestment Coalition, which pushes banks to offer fair and equal access to credit, claimed that the bulk of OneWest’s estimated 35,000 foreclosures took place in minority communities and that the bank was notoriously difficult when dealing with homeowners and housing counselors. It was alleged practices like those that drew the ire of the “Make Banks Pay” protesters who visited Mnuchin’s home. Regulators, too, went after OneWest’s foreclosure practices. In 2011, two years after Mnuchin’s group came in, the Office of Thrift Supervision hit the bank with a regulatory order saying it had failed to follow various procedures when foreclosing on homeowners. CIT Group did not respond to requests for comment. OneWest and Mnuchin also were embroiled in the saga of Relativity Media, the studio co-founded by flashy Hollywood executive Ryan Kavanaugh. Mnuchin had invested in the studio via Dune, and served as nonexecutive co-chairman of the board from October 2014 to May 2015, exiting just ahead of the company’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy. According to documents from Relativity’s bankruptcy proceedings, OneWest, a lender to the studio, was repaid $50 million it lent to the company just before it filed for bankruptcy protection. A July 2015 filing by Relativity’s financial adviser at Blackstone Group, which was hired to advise the studio before its bankruptcy, said that this repayment exacerbated its “already problematic liquidity situation.” Adviser Timothy Coleman of Blackstone wrote in the filing that this caused Relativity to “largely have to stop paying many vendor bills, to postpone production of certain film projects, and to postpone the release of certain completed films.” Typically, bankruptcy courts look askance at large payments to one creditor shortly before filing for Chapter 11, because companies aren’t supposed to favor one creditor over another. Nonetheless, Relativity’s plan to reorganize its business was approved by a New York bankruptcy court judge in March, wiping hundreds of million of dollars of debt from its balance sheet.

Chris Christie on Friday amid increasing signs that the effort to prepare the next White House is off to a rocky start. Trump also took the unusual... (Noah Bierman and Michael A. Memoli) But the issue of the $50 million repayment also surfaced in a civil lawsuit filed by RKA Film Financing, an investor in Relativity, against Kavanaugh, Mnuchin and others. The case, which was filed in New York County Supreme Court and included allegations of fraud, claimed that money RKA lent to Relativity was used for purposes other than those it was earmarked for. The lawsuit alleged that at least some of RKA’s money was likely included in the funds paid to OneWest. The complaint, which was first filed last year and amended in March, claimed that Mnuchin “was in a unique position, affording him knowledge of both Relativity’s precarious financial position and the ability to ensure certain creditors — namely, OneWest Bank — were able to siphon away funds that had been commingled with RKA’s [money].” In separate June court filings, Kavanaugh and Mnuchin asked the court to throw out the case. It was dismissed Oct. 11 by Judge Charles Ramos, according to court documents. Ramos has given RKA, which sought damages of more than $110 million, the chance to replead the case. Mnuchin’s attorney, Robert Sacks, said that claims made about Mnuchin in the lawsuit were “preposterous.” He said that the contract between RKA and Relativity was entered into before Mnuchin invested in the studio, adding that RKA has “no basis whatsoever to assert a claim against Steve Mnuchin and they’ve articulated none.” Sacks dismissed RKA’s claim that Mnuchin’s connection to OneWest and Relativity uniquely situated him to ensure the bank was repaid ahead others. “The bank had whatever rights the bank had based on [having] provided funds to Relativity,” Sacks said. "Steve Mnuchin did not have a dual role with regard to that.” In a statement, Beverly Hills-based Relativity said it was pleased with Ramos’ Oct. 11 decision. But the dispute may not be over. Attorney Benjamin Naftalis, who represents RKA, said his client plans to soon file an amended complaint. “RKA has and will allege a fraud claim,” Naftalis said. “And Steve Mnuchin played an integral role in executing that fraud and misappropriating RKA’s investment to his and others’ benefit.” Mnuchin would be an out-of-the box choice for Treasury secretary, having neither served in government nor risen to the top ranks of corporate America. Treasury secretaries appointed by Barack Obama and George W. Bush all worked for the federal government at some point in their careers.  And the three secretaries appointed by Bush were all chief executives of major corporations. Henry Paulson, for example, worked in the Defense Department in the 1970s and was chief executive of Goldman Sachs before being named Treasury secretary.

(Michael Nagle/Bloomberg) EQUITIES Goldman and ‘Gandalf’ are bullish on U.S. stocks under Trump Add to ... Luke Kawa, Julie Verhage and Joanna Ossinger Bloomberg News Published Friday, Nov. 11, 2016 3:10PM EST Last updated Friday, Nov. 11, 2016 7:56PM EST Comments AA Who thinks President-Elect Trump will be good for U.S. stocks? Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and the JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist known as ‘Gandalf,’ to name one high-profile pair. A Goldman team led by Equity Strategist Benjamin Snider highlighted the potential for corporate tax reform as a major tailwind for the financial performance of Corporate America. “Each percentage point change in the effective U.S. corporate tax rate is worth about $1.50 of 2017 S&P 500 earnings per share [EPS],” the team writes. “A change in the effective tax rate to 20 per cent from the current 26 per cent would boost our EPS forecast by 8 per cent to $125.” This would represent year-over-year growth of 20 per cent, or double their current expectation. Appetite for U.S. stocks has been immense since the election. Two-day inflows into the SPDR S&P 500 exchange traded fund, the largest ETF by assets, hit their highest level in over a year on Thursday. After slumping as the election results started to roll in, the front-month S&P 500 futures contract jumped nearly 7 per cent from trough to peak on Wednesday. Another benefit to U.S. stocks that Goldman sees is an increase in buybacks, also linked to changing tax policy under Mr. Trump. Historically, when there is a repatriation tax holiday like the one Mr. Trump discussed on the campaign trail, firms have used cash brought back from oversees for share repurchases, which has been a huge source of net demand for stocks throughout this bull market. JPM Global Head of Quantitative and Derivatives Strategy Marko Kolanovic, meanwhile, has long disagreed with the overwhelming consensus that a Trump victory would be negative for markets. But the extent of investor enthusiasm since the election has caught the strategist off guard. “The previously quoted (though often overblown) risks of Trump’s presidency are now likely higher, not lower,” writes Mr. Kolanovic, who was likened to the Lord of the Rings wizard after his prescient calls on related to the Chinese devaluation of 2015. “While we think that Trump’s win is medium-term positive for equities, we are not fully out of the woods yet.” At this point, the markets appear to have been more fixated on the aspects of a Trump presidency that could be positive for growth, like new infrastructure spending and tax reform, than the potentially detrimental aspects, like limits on immigration and trade protectionism. “As we advocated in our previously published research: emerging market assets, Commodities, Gold and Value stocks should outperform, and USD, Bond proxies and Quality should underperform,” writes Mr. Kolanovic. “This long term trend, which is reinforced by Trump’s win, is ‘cautiously optimistic reflation,’ rather than a ‘full risk on’ and ‘hawkish Fed’ trade.” Goldman’s team added that the bond market selloff could limit the extent to which stocks rise due to the regime change. “Historically low rates lifted U.S. equity valuations to near-record highs, and if risk-free rates continue to rise they may result in lower equity valuations,” concludes Mr. Snider.

The Standard & Poor’s 500 index, a broader measure of the stock market, also eked out a gain, adding to a big rally the day before following Donald Trump’s presidential election victory. The Nasdaq composite closed lower, weighed down by a slide in technology companies. Bond prices slumped again, sending yields higher. “You are seeing a massive swing out of cash and fixed-income and into equities to take advantage of this pro-growth cycle that the market believes we’re beginning,” said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. The Dow climbed 218.19 points, or 1.2 percent, to 18,807.88. That’s a gain of about 1 percent from the average’s previous record high set on Aug. 15. The S&P 500 index added 4.22 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,167.48. The Dow and S&P 500 index are on a four-day winning streak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 42.28 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,208.80. Investors continued to make moves based on the bevy of possible policy changes that the Trump administration could implement once it takes over in January. Those include cutting taxes, increasing infrastructure spending and slashing government regulation of businesses. That’s particularly given a boost to financial, industrial and health care stocks, while prompting traders to sell consumer goods companies, utilities and phone companies. Investors have also continued to pull out of bonds in anticipation that Trump’s policies could usher in stronger economy and, possibly, higher inflation, both of which are bad for bonds. The sell-off in bonds continued Thursday, sending bond prices lower and kicking the yield on the 10-year Treasury note up to 2.15 percent, the highest it’s been since January, from 2.06 percent late Wednesday. That yield is a benchmark used to set interest rates on many kinds of loans including home mortgages. Traders have been selling bonds more aggressively to hedge against the possibility that interest rates, which have been ultra-low for years, could rise steadily again under Trump’s administration. That scenario would favor banks and other financial companies, one reason why the sector continued to rally Thursday. Higher interest rates help banks earn more money from lending, and years of ultra-low rates have crimped profits at big banks. JPMorgan Chase led the 30 companies in the Dow, climbing $3.40, or 4.6 percent, to $76.65. It was followed by Goldman Sachs, which rose $8.24, or 4.3 percent, to $200.87. Wells Fargo gained $3.64, or 7.6 percent, to $51.63, while Discover Financial Services added $3.31, or 5.5 percent, to $63.60. Traders also bid up shares in Macy’s and Kohl’s after the companies reported their latest quarterly results. Macy’s rose $2.1, or 5.6 percent, to $40.53. Kohl’s was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500, adding $5.27, or 11.5 percent, to $50.97. Some big names in the technology sector closed lower. Netflix slumped $6.77, or 5.5 percent, to $115.42, while Amazon.com slid $29.50, or 3.8 percent, to $742.38. Microsoft fell $1.47, or 2.4 percent, to $58.70. Shares in several phone companies also slumped. AT&T lost 87 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $36.57, while Verizon slid $1.17, or 2.4 percent, to $46.69. The major stock indexes in Europe turned lower after an early rally. Germany’s DAX slid 0.1 percent, while the CAC-40 in France fell 0.3 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 lost 1.2 percent. Optimism that Trump’s election will improve U.S.-Russia relations helped lift the Micex index in Moscow 0.9 percent. Markets in Asia fared better. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index rocketed 6.7 percent after sliding more than 5 percent the day before. South Korea’s Kospi advanced 2.3 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 1.9 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 surged 3.3 percent. Crude oil prices declined. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 61 cents, or 1.3 percent, to close at $44.66 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 52 cents, or 1.1 percent, to close at $45.84 a barrel in London. Other energy futures also closed lower. Wholesale gasoline slid 2 cents to $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil fell a penny to $1.44 a gallon. Natural gas lost 6 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.63 per 1,000 cubic feet. In metals trading, the price of gold fell $7.10 to $1,266.40 an ounce, while silver added 36 cents, or 2 percent, to $18.74 an ounce. Copper rose 9 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $2.55 a pound. In currency trading, the dollar continued to strengthen Thursday. The U.S. currency rose to 106.83 yen from 105.84 yen on Wednesday, while the euro slid to $1.0890 from $1.0930. The Mexican peso continued to weaken against the dollar. One dollar bought 20.61 pesos on Thursday, more than the 19.87 pesos it bought late Wednesday. Investors worry that Trump’s anti-immigration stance and intention to repeal a trade pact with Mexico could hurt that country’s economy.     Tags: percent, companies, while, cents, continued, index, Other stories from today: Yahoo took its time investigating massive security breach Dow sets record high; oil slumps Rule would boost solar and wind energy on public lands     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   In six months, the economy will be ...

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon did not support Republican Donald Trump's presidential campaign, yet some Trump advisers want America's most famous banker to become Treasury Secretary to calm nerves on Wall Street. A member of Trump's transition team contacted Dimon recently to see if he would be interested in the role, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday. It was not clear whether Dimon had responded, though he has said emphatically multiple times that he was not interested in the role. JPMorgan spokesman Andrew Gray declined to comment, and Dimon, who is traveling outside the United States, could not be reached. Trump's close circle of advisers includes several with Wall Street ties. His campaign finance manager, Steven Mnuchin, is a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker. Fundraiser Anthony Scaramucci is a hedge fund executive. A person familiar with Trump's personnel efforts said the transition team's list included Dimon, Mnuchin and Rep. Jeb Hensarling. The person said that Mnuchin was a more likely choice given his proximity to Trump. Trump's controversial rhetoric and behavior during the campaign concerning immigrants, women, minorities, the disabled, Muslims and China, among other things, were offensive to many senior Wall Street executives who have tried to embrace inclusion, diversity and globalization. Trump also criticized Wall Street on the trail, saying the industry "got away with murder" and would not be let off the hook. Since being elected on Tuesday, Trump has softened his tone and tried to bridge gaps by meeting with President Obama and taking calls from foreign officials. Bringing Dimon on board could help him mend fences with the financial industry, which appears to be coming around to the idea of Trump in the White House. At an event on Thursday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. CEO Lloyd Blankfein said Trump could be good for the economy and Dimon would be an excellent choice for Treasury Secretary, while hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said Trump's advisers would get "the best and brightest" to run the economy. Hensarling's office indicated in a statement that he did not want the job. "Serving in his Cabinet is not something I've indicated an interest in and it's not something I am pursuing," the statement said. He said he looked forward to working in Congress to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act which tightened regulations on Wall Street in the wake of the financial crisis. Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, has been floated as a possible candidate for roles like Treasury Secretary in the past. However, resentment toward bankers following the 2007-2009 financial crisis made his candidacy much less likely, as did JPMorgan-specific scandals related to a costly derivatives trade and bad mortgages. A $13 billion mortgage settlement JPMorgan reached with the federal government in 2013 prompted Trump then to call Dimon "the worst banker in the United States." However, Dimon has managed to retain a reputation within the banking industry as a distinguished leader, in part by the way he handled those scandals and the way he talks about JPMorgan's role in society as the largest U.S. bank. For instance, Dimon decided to have JPMorgan make big investments in Detroit, calling it a civic duty to turn around an economically challenged city. His memos, speeches and letters to shareholders are often sprinkled with patriotic language. "America is best when we come together with clear leadership, expertise and the political will to take on difficult challenges and get things done," the 60-year-old chairman and CEO said in a memo to JPMorgan Chase employees following Tuesday's election. "No one should ever doubt the strength and resilience of our country and our democracy." However, Dimon has said as recently as September that he would not want a role as Treasury Secretary. If he holds to that, it could put him and JPMorgan in an awkward position. Saying "no" to a presidential request to join the cabinet is unusual, and the bank would then be overseen by appointees from an administration Dimon rejected. Even so, his associates do not expect Dimon to say "yes." Dimon has said his determination to act would make it hard to make political compromises. Talking before an audience in September, he said the only job in government he would want is the one Trump is about to get. "I would love to be president of the United States of America," Dimon told the Economic Club of Washington. "Until Donald Trump got to where he was, they said you'll never see a rich businessman who's never been in politics be president. I clearly was wrong about that." © 2016 Thomson/Reuters.

The only problem with this is Dimon really doesn’t want the job. He didn’t want it before the election, he doesn’t want it now. Is it possible Trump could appeal to Dimon’s sense of patriotism to get him to take the job? Sure. It’s tough when the call from a president-elect comes in. But don’t bet on it. A similar dynamic took place during George W. Bush’s presidency when the president asked then-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson to serve at Treasury. Paulson initially said no. Then Bush pleaded with him when the financial crisis hit and he agreed. So it’s possible that right now, Dimon is a no. But these things can change with time and events. Story Continued Below Other scuttlebutt: Trump advisor Steve Mnuchin is also said to not really want the job. House Financial Services Committee Chair Jeb Hensarling also got a mention for Treasury. He said this to POLITICO’s Zachary Warmbrodt: “It’s nice to be mentioned, and I certainly want to help our new president make America stronger and more prosperous, but serving in his Cabinet is not something I’ve indicated an interest in and it’s not something I am pursuing. “I’ve got enough on my plate working for the great people of Texas and serving as chairman of the Financial Services Committee. The president-elect has said that repealing the Dodd-Frank Act is among his top priorities, and I look forward to working as his ally in the House to do just that and replace it with common sense reforms like those in the Financial CHOICE Act.” BANK STOCKS POP ON TRUMP HOPE — POLITICO’s Ben White: “Markets continued to defy grim predictions of a Donald Trump-induced selloff on Thursday, with the Dow soaring to new highs. The biggest winners in the post-election advance: Wall Street’s largest banks. Stocks in some of the biggest financial firms in the world including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase are rocketing higher after Trump’s shocking win on hopes for a lighter regulatory hand and the big role that experienced Wall Street veterans could play in the new administration. “‘The pre-election narrative was wrong,’ said Christopher Whalen, head of research at Kroll Bond Rating Agency. ‘We all assumed we were entering an era of left-wing democracy. But now we have a pro-growth GOP president and a pro-growth GOP Congress and we have to completely reset the narrative.’” OUR FAV LINE — “[T]he relief on Wall Street suggests many believe the era of bankers as national villains is coming to an end. ‘It’s not just that there is now a Republican president, it’s that Republicans held the Senate and that’s quite important,’ said Michael Mayo, a veteran banking industry analyst now at CLSA. “As of Nov. 8th, the financial crisis is over. As of that day we go from bashing banks to using banks to help facilitate economic growth.” Read more. WHY BANKERS ARE PSYCHED — Here’s some of the language from the Trump transition web site: “Following the financial crisis, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Act, a sprawling and complex piece of legislation that has unleashed hundreds of new rules and several new bureaucratic agencies. The proponents of Dodd-Frank promised that it would lift our economy. Yet now, six years later, the American people remain stuck in the slowest, weakest, most tepid recovery since the Great Depression. … “The Dodd-Frank economy does not work for working people. Bureaucratic red tape and Washington mandates are not the answer. The Financial Services Policy Implementation team will be working to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation” Read more. BANKS SEE GOLD IN TRUMP — POLITICO’s Victoria Guida and Zachary Warmbrodt: “In the wake of … Trump’s stunning presidential win, banks are working on a game plan to confront an entirely new reality: They might actually get their way. While Trump bashed Wall Street throughout the campaign, the financial services industry is hoping his victory, coupled with a GOP-led Congress, could open a path forward to easing regulations. “‘To say the world has changed is an understatement,’ one bank lobbyist said. The defensive issues we were concerned about we can be less concerned about. And we can start thinking about, to some degree, an affirmative agenda. … We didn’t have a plan B, so now everyone’s got to come up with a plan B.’” Read more. ONE OTHER NOTE — A top DC hand emails: “There seems to be a glaring omission here. What about Trump's commitment to reinstate Glass Steagall? His base hates Wall Street. Cozying up to the big banks would be an interesting positioning for him.” HENSARLING: BYE BYE DODD-FRANK — From an interview in Morning Consult: “The president-elect has fortunately been outspoken — as I have been — on the need to repeal and replace Dodd-Frank, so I’m very encouraged by that … I have had a number of meetings with his transition team on the issue. I know, personally, it is something that Vice President-elect [Mike] Pence is very enthusiastic about.” Read more. RESTOCK THE SWAMP? — Via POLITICO’s Isaac Arnsdorf: “So much for #DrainTheSwamp? Lobbyists are all over Donald Trump's transition team, according to an organization chart obtained by POLITICO that shows who's guiding the handover for various agencies. Cindy Hayden of tobacco company Altria is in charge of Homeland Security; Steve Hart, the chairman of Williams & Jensen, is in charge of Labor; Paul Atkins, though not a lobbyist, is CEO of advisory firm Patomak Global Partners and charged with independent financial agencies” Read more A BOON FOR K STREET — NYT’s Eric Lipton: “Trent Lott, the former Republican senator from Mississippi, had gleefully flown back from Florida, where he had been working for the campaign of Donald J. Trump. Now a powerful lobbyist, his phone had been buzzing nonstop and he was busy helping to organize a briefing Thursday morning for dozens of corporate clients. “He was not alone. The stunning surprise of the election, and the political chaos it created, is a boon for Washington’s lobbying corridor known as K Street. Corporate America is both excited and anxious about the prospect of Mr. Trump’s presidency, seeing great opportunity to shape the agenda after an extended period of frustration over gridlock in Congress” Read more.

We know saving for retirement can be difficult, but policymakers can help by supporting policies to encourage saving, make retirement plans more widely available, and facilitate access to lifetime income strategies. Let’s send Americans paychecks for life. Learn more at: http://irionline.org/agenda. ** WARREN OFFERS DEMS A WAY — POLITICO’s Gabriel Debenedetti and Madeline Conway: “With Hillary Clinton cast aside as the torchbearer for the Democratic Party, Elizabeth Warren is trying to pick up the flame. Clearly aiming to provide Democrats with a path forward in the President-Elect Donald Trump era, the progressive hero Massachusetts senator lit into the president-elect with her typical force during a hastily arranged speech at the AFL-CIO on Thursday … but she also insisted that Americans pay attention to his populist message. “The feeling that the speech at the labor behemoth’s executive council meeting was designed to break from Clinton’s Democratic Party, however, was unavoidable: She didn’t mention Clinton once, despite supporting and campaigning for her in the general election. ‘This wasn’t a pretty election. In fact, it was ugly, and we should not sugarcoat the reason why,’ she said toward the beginning of her address. ‘Donald Trump ran a campaign that started with racial attacks and then rode the escalator down. He encouraged a toxic stew of hatred and fear. He attacked millions of Americans” Read more. TRUMP TO DUMP TPP — POLITICO’s Adam Behsudi and Nancy Cook: “Trump plans to move quickly to fulfill some of his most controversial campaign promises related to what he derided as ‘job-killing’ trade policies, according to an internal transition team document shared with POLITICO. Within the first 100 days, his administration will drop out of TPP, and 100 days after that it could withdraw from NAFTA unless certain demands are met .. “Other first-day business includes labeling China a currency manipulator — something the Obama administration avoided in its eight years, and teaming up the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to examine all major proposed foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies to ensure equal opportunities for American investors abroad” Read more. THE NEXT OMB DIRECTOR? — Via POLITICO’s daily transition news letter: “We're hearing that Eric Ueland, staff director of the Senate Budget Committee, is being considered to lead the Office of Management and Budget in a Trump White House. Ueland has been working on the Trump transition and his pick would likely garner respect from both parties on Capitol Hill. Ueland has spent some two decades in the Senate — starting as a young aide in the Senate Republican Policy Committee in 1989, and ultimately becoming chief of staff to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) in 2005” WHAT NEXT FOR FIN REG UNDER TRUMP — Via BPC’s Justin Schardin: “As a candidate … Trump laid out few specific policy proposals on financial regulation, so it is difficult to know exactly what the future of financial regulation will be under the newly elected President Trump’s administration. Trump has made two specific financial regulatory policy proposals: a moratorium on new regulations, and the reinstatement of Glass-Steagall provisions … “Those two policies are in conflict with each other, at least in spirit. Trump has also argued that too much regulation is causing banks not to lend, and that as president he would ‘dismantle’ the Dodd-Frank Act.” Read more THIEL TO TRANSITION TEAM — Via Dan Primack: “Peter Thiel has agreed to join Donald Trump's presidential transition team, according to multiple sources close to the situation. Thiel, a venture capitalist and hedge fund manager who also serves on the board of directors at Facebook, has been Trump's most prominent Silicon Valley supporter, even speaking on his behalf at the Republican National Convention” Jeff Hauser, Director of the Revolving Door Project on Trump Treasury: “It now appears that Trump is seeking a diverse array of choices for Treasury — unlike Bush, he will consider what JP Morgan has to offer (Dimon) in addition to Goldman Sachs (Mnuchin).” TRUMP COULD PICK HENSARLING — WSJ’s Damian Paletta, Ryan Tracy and Michael Bender: “Aides to President-elect Donald Trump are considering Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) as a candidate for Treasury secretary, a pick that would bring an elected official with a free-market background and deep GOP ties into one of the cabinet’s most powerful posts, people familiar with the matter said. “Mr. Hensarling’s consideration shows the strong influence Vice President-elect Mike Pence has on key decisions. Messrs. Pence and Hensarling worked closely together in the House of Representatives, and their views on many financial issues are closely aligned.” Read more. … OR DIVERSIFY HIS PORTFOLIO — Reuters’ Dan Freed and David Henry: “JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon did not support Republican Donald Trump's presidential campaign, yet some Trump advisers want America's most famous banker to become Treasury Secretary to calm nerves on Wall Street. “A member of Trump's transition team contacted Dimon recently to see if he would be interested in the role, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.”Read more. DODD-FRANK UNDER FIRE — Bloomberg’s Jesse Hamilton and Elizabeth Dexheimer: “President-elect Donald Trump is translating some of his populist campaign rhetoric into policy statements, including the contention that the Dodd-Frank Act should be scrapped because it has made Wall Street banks an even bigger threat to the nation’s economy and working families. In addition to repealing Dodd-Frank, Trump’s transition website outlines several policies that will be familiar to those who followed his campaign, including calls for a moratorium on new rules so existing measures can be reviewed. It also broadly addressed a tax-code overhaul, saying Trump’s plan ‘can be summarized as lower, simpler, fairer, and pro-growth.’” Read more. TOOL OF THE TRADE [WAR] — NYT’s Keith Bradsher: “As president of the United States, Mr. Trump can use trade — a cornerstone of his populist rise — as a weapon, with the potential to drastically reshape the world’s two largest economies, as well as the companies, industries and workers who depend on their hundreds of billions of dollars in closely linked goods. But neither side may win. “Should Mr. Trump want to signal an aggressive stance quickly, he could move against imports of steel and aluminum from China. The Obama administration has been preparing to file a World Trade Organization case against China over claims that it subsidized aluminum exports.” Read more. TPP COUNTER MOVES FORWARD — FT’s Tom Mitchell, Shawn Donnan and Robin Harding: “Xi Jinping is rekindling efforts to promote a rival to the US-led Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement in the wake of Donald Trump’s election victory, Chinese officials said on Thursday. “China’s efforts have been focused on wrapping up talks over a deal known as the ‘Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership’ with the 10 members of Asean and other countries including Australia and India.” Read more. RUSSIAN BANKS UNDER CYBER ATTACK — BBC News: “Five Russian banks have been under intermittent cyber-attack for two days, said the country's banking regulator. “The hackers behind the DDoS attacks are believed to have generated the huge amounts of data by taking over smart devices such as webcams and digital video recorders that use easy to guess passwords. Devices in the USA, India, Taiwan and Israel were all used in the attack, said the security firm.” Read more. ROUND THREE FOR GOOGLE — WSJ’s Natalia Drozdiak and Sam Schechner: “Google on Thursday fired off its response to the third set of formal charges issued by the European Commission, the bloc’s antitrust regulator — this time rebutting the EU’s allegations that the search giant abuses its dominance with its mobile operating service Android. “If the EU deems Google guilty, the regulator could impose hefty fines in each of the three cases and require that Google overhaul its operations in parts. But such a finding by the EU could also cause further damage for Google.” Read more. INVITE REJECTED — WSJ’s Olga Razumovskaya and Laura Mills: “A Moscow court upheld a decision to ban the professional social network LinkedIn Corp. in Russia on Thursday in a landmark ruling enforcing a personal data law. “The spokesman also said that the regulator would now enter LinkedIn into a special registry of websites that are in violation of the data-localization law. The website will be blocked in Russia three working days after that, he added.” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: As traditional pensions have disappeared, American workers have become more responsible for saving and preparing for their retirements. With longer lifespans, this often means saving for a longer retirement. These challenges have made planning and saving for retirement more difficult. But what if all Americans could get paychecks for life? Policymakers can help make this possible by supporting policies that encourage saving, make workplace retirement plans more broadly available, and facilitate access to lifetime income strategies.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A      JPMorgan told investors the market will rally into early next year due to optimism about the Republican economic agenda, CNBC.com reported. "We interpret the U.S. election outcome with a Republican sweep as pro-growth for equities," strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote in a note to clients Thursday. "Expectations of decreased regulation, favorable tax reform, increased fiscal spending and less congressional gridlock should drive stronger revenue growth and higher net income margins. Further, the removal of election uncertainty and some form of cash repatriation should result in increased investment activity," the note read. Lakos-Bujas cited how a reduction in the corporate tax rate to 15 percent or 20 percent versus the current effective rate of about 25 percent could add $10 to $15 in earnings per share to the S&P 500. As a result, he predicts the benchmark will rally to 2,300 "by early next year," representing 6 percent upside from Wednesday's close. "Trump administration reinforces the reflation trade that started post-Brexit. We expect reflation to support rotation from Low Vol stocks, the largest beneficiaries of falling yields in this cycle, into value and growth stocks," he wrote. The strategist said infrastructure spending is "high on Trump's agenda." Consequently, the largest beneficiaries will be domestic construction materials, metals, mining and transportation stocks. JPMorgan isn't alone in its enthusiasm for Trump's potential Veteran financial guru Larry Kudlow, who served as the Trump campaign's senior economic adviser, tells Newsmax TV that Trump will live up to his campaign vows to restore prosperity to all Americans and the nation we all love. "Donald Trump has a very strong economic growth message which is going to be great for the economy and for profits and for businesses large and small," Kudlow said Wednesday to Steve Malzberg on "America Talks Live." Kudlow, a Newsmax Finance Insider and CNBC senior contributor, said the billionaire real-estate tycoon was successful because he understands the dissatisfaction of "ordinary middle-class folk."  "With Mr. Trump you're going to have across the board tax cuts, you're going to end Obamacare, which is a prosperity killer and a healthcare killer, you're going to take the handcuffs off of energy, you're going to wall back all these regulations and you're going to stop the government from taking over the economy. That's a powerful message," Kudlow said. Trump "understood that they were angry and that the establishment in Washington and elsewhere was not delivering. He understood that they wanted change and he understood that they wanted to drain the swamp, get rid of the corruption, stop the corporate cronyism," Kudlow said. "He understood that instinctively and he knew that people were not willing to give up the American dream … I think it was effective and I think he hit it exactly right. He just understood the American people in a way that no other political figure has understood it." But the possibility of Trump slapping punitive tariffs on exports from some countries such as China has unnerved some investors.  "The markets are adjusting to a new reality and are giving Trump the benefit of doubt," Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of Sarhan Capital, told Reuters. "He does have some problems with immigration and with social issues, but his economic policies, at least in the short-term, are perceived to be stimulative and net good for the economy and that's why stocks are rallying."

Below is the performance of major assets, sectors and stocks during periods of rising inflation. You'll see why investors are crowding into copper and selling technology stocks this week, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average to record levels. But they may be missing a trade in consumer staples and other parts of the financial markets, history shows.

In the wake of Donald Trump's upset victory, advisors have floated the idea of naming Jamie Dimon as treasury secretary, according to two people familiar with the matter, but one of them added that the JPMorgan chief has said he would not be interested in the role. A Trump spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment, and a spokesman for Dimon declined to elaborate beyond his past remarks that he would not be interested. It was unclear who within Trump's circle of advisors raised the idea or who else might be under consideration for treasury secretary. Trump campaign finance chief Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs official, is reportedly considered to be the front runner. Dimon has suggested repeatedly, including in an interview at the Economic Club of Washington in September, that he would not be interested in becoming treasury secretary.   And the Best Place to Work in the global financial markets 2016 is...

(Mary Altaffer/AP) By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Published: November 10, 2016, 9:35 PM A   A Banks and other financial companies led U.S. stocks mostly higher Thursday, propelling the Dow Jones industrial average to a record high. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index, a broader measure of the stock market, also eked out a gain, adding to a big rally the day before following Donald Trump’s presidential election victory. The Nasdaq composite closed lower, weighed down by a slide in technology companies. Bond prices slumped again, sending yields higher. “You are seeing a massive swing out of cash and fixed-income and into equities to take advantage of this pro-growth cycle that the market believes we’re beginning,” said David Lyon, global investment specialist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. The Dow climbed 218.19 points, or 1.2 percent, to 18,807.88. That’s a gain of about 1 percent from the average’s previous record high set on Aug. 15. The S&P 500 index added 4.22 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,167.48. The Dow and S&P 500 index are on a four-day winning streak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 42.28 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,208.80. Investors continued to make moves based on the bevy of possible policy changes that the Trump administration could implement once it takes over in January. Those include cutting taxes, increasing infrastructure spending and slashing government regulation of businesses. That’s particularly given a boost to financial, industrial and health care stocks, while prompting traders to sell consumer goods companies, utilities and phone companies. Investors have also continued to pull out of bonds in anticipation that Trump’s policies could usher in stronger economy and, possibly, higher inflation, both of which are bad for bonds. The sell-off in bonds continued Thursday, sending bond prices lower and kicking the yield on the 10-year Treasury note up to 2.15 percent, the highest it’s been since January, from 2.06 percent late Wednesday. That yield is a benchmark used to set interest rates on many kinds of loans including home mortgages. Traders have been selling bonds more aggressively to hedge against the possibility that interest rates, which have been ultra-low for years, could rise steadily again under Trump’s administration. That scenario would favor banks and other financial companies, one reason why the sector continued to rally Thursday. Higher interest rates help banks earn more money from lending, and years of ultra-low rates have crimped profits at big banks. JPMorgan Chase led the 30 companies in the Dow, climbing $3.40, or 4.6 percent, to $76.65. It was followed by Goldman Sachs, which rose $8.24, or 4.3 percent, to $200.87. Wells Fargo gained $3.64, or 7.6 percent, to $51.63, while Discover Financial Services added $3.31, or 5.5 percent, to $63.60. Traders also bid up shares in Macy’s and Kohl’s after the companies reported their latest quarterly results. Macy’s rose $2.1, or 5.6 percent, to $40.53. Kohl’s was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500, adding $5.27, or 11.5 percent, to $50.97. Some big names in the technology sector closed lower. Netflix slumped $6.77, or 5.5 percent, to $115.42, while Amazon.com slid $29.50, or 3.8 percent, to $742.38. Microsoft fell $1.47, or 2.4 percent, to $58.70. Shares in several phone companies also slumped. AT&T lost 87 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $36.57, while Verizon slid $1.17, or 2.4 percent, to $46.69. The major stock indexes in Europe turned lower after an early rally. Germany’s DAX slid 0.1 percent, while the CAC-40 in France fell 0.3 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 lost 1.2 percent. Optimism that Trump’s election will improve U.S.-Russia relations helped lift the Micex index in Moscow 0.9 percent. Markets in Asia fared better. Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 index rocketed 6.7 percent after sliding more than 5 percent the day before. South Korea’s Kospi advanced 2.3 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng added 1.9 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 surged 3.3 percent. Crude oil prices declined. Benchmark U.S. crude fell 61 cents, or 1.3 percent, to close at $44.66 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost 52 cents, or 1.1 percent, to close at $45.84 a barrel in London. Other energy futures also closed lower. Wholesale gasoline slid 2 cents to $1.34 a gallon. Heating oil fell a penny to $1.44 a gallon. Natural gas lost 6 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $2.63 per 1,000 cubic feet. In metals trading, the price of gold fell $7.10 to $1,266.40 an ounce, while silver added 36 cents, or 2 percent, to $18.74 an ounce. Copper rose 9 cents, or 3.7 percent, to $2.55 a pound. In currency trading, the dollar continued to strengthen Thursday. The U.S. currency rose to 106.83 yen from 105.84 yen on Wednesday, while the euro slid to $1.0890 from $1.0930. The Mexican peso continued to weaken against the dollar. One dollar bought 20.61 pesos on Thursday, more than the 19.87 pesos it bought late Wednesday. Investors worry that Trump’s anti-immigration stance and intention to repeal a trade pact with Mexico could hurt that country’s economy.

Photograph: Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images Contact author @MarinaHyde Friday 11 November 2016 14.16 EST Last modified on Tuesday 15 November 2016 16.32 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Ironically, I am starting to feel a bit “left behind” by Nigel Farage. He was pretty much working as a waitress in a cocktail bar when we met him. (Certainly a less elitist backstory to the accurate one: namely, that he was a private-school-educated City commodities trader.) But now, like some on-the-make media prick who always looks over your shoulder in case someone better comes along, Nigel has caught Donald Trump’s eye and walked off mid-conversation with us. As Alan Partridge almost said: “Don! Don! Don! Don! Don! Don! Don! DON!” In fact, it’s starting to feel like Nigel freeing us from the EU will turn out to be a classic early-21st-century “liberation” operation. There hasn’t been a “here’s your sovereignty – see ya!” like it since 2004, when coalition governor Paul Bremer handed over to the Iraqis, and promptly floored it to the airport. Nigel, aren’t you staying for the Brexit party? I think it’s going to get really lively! But Nigel has gone off to America, where he is rampant. Mr Big Stuff – who do you think you are? Let Nigel tell you who he thinks he is. “I’m the catalyst for the downfall of the Blairites, the Clintonites, the Bushites, and all these dreadful people who work hand in glove with Goldman Sachs and everybody else, who have made themselves rich, and ruined our countries,” Farage explained in a radio interview this week, about 10 minutes before JPMorgan boss Jamie Dimon was touted as Trump’s Treasury pick. The 'special relationship' - in pictures Read more Anyway, Nigel can’t wait to tell you how yuge he is now. A man who failed to get elected to our parliament seven times is referring to the two-term president of the United States as “that Obama creature”. Sources are briefing he will be the go-between for Trump and Theresa May, though Number 10 denies a role. “If [Trump] did offer me a job,” Farage has said, “I would quite like to be his ambassador to the European Union.” And if none of these plays comes off, he can always link himself with a big-money move to LA Galaxy. In the meantime, he is styling himself as the Maggie to Donald’s Ronnie, even though you just know Trump is eventually going to do something far more humiliating to him than just invade Grenada without telling him. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Nigel Farage: ‘I’ll tell Donald Trump not to touch Theresa May’ – audio Until then, Nigel is all dressed up and doing the town. Consider the advice he said he’d give Trump about meeting Theresa May: “Don’t touch her, for God’s sake!” Remember, girls: even when you’re the prime minister you haven’t escaped guys joking about you being sexually assaulted. You’ve dropped your trade briefing papers on the floor, Mrs May. While you’re down there … “If it comes to it,” Nigel went on, “I could be there as the responsible adult role, to make sure everything’s OK.” Wow. When Nigel said “I want my life back”, I’d assumed he meant spending sullen time with his family, not acting as the cockblock intern for the leader of the free pussy-grabbers. For all its comic grotesquery, of course, the Farage/Trump dynamic is an old tale: British politicians getting a massive hard-on for American ones. People derided Tony Blair as George W Bush’s poodle, and Nigel’s version of lapdogging is just a different take. Farage could literally curl up on Trump’s lap to stop him assaulting female premiers. If they widened his frottage-combating duties it could be a fulltime job – Trump will be in the presence of many females a day, and you have to remember he is a man whose sole, frequently stated reason for not coming on to his own daughter is the fact they’re related. So Farage could be kept in the Oval Office as an anti-grope Jeeves. And he’d be grateful. This week I saw a hilarious clip of Trump beckoning Farage out of a crowd – a bit like Courteney Cox in the Dancing in the Dark video – and Farage telling him obsequiously he was “handing over the mantle”. Aw, the look on his little face just for being noticed! It was like a wildlife documentary, where some weaker male in the pack defers to the alpha. Donald has had the sex Nigel only wishes he’d had. Still, if Nigel can’t have had it, he’s going to stand as near to someone who has as he’s allowed. Everything seems bigger in America – even bits of Nigel Farage. Like Trump, Nigel’s the sort of champion of ordinary people who looks like he’d privately scream for the sanitiser the minute he’d finished having to shake their hands. Tabloid editors used to have a nasty phrase for this shudder-inducing contact: “meet the readers”. It is possible Farage will be the most successful British politician in 30 years as well as a man of very small stature I detect the exact same discomfort in men such as Nigel and Donald. During the last general election campaign, I waited for hours in a Grimsby pub with Nigel’s supporters and canvassers for him to honour his planned appearance. But he blew them out to go and have lunch with reality star Joey Essex, who he’d already spent half the morning with. They were so disappointed, and I felt for them. The point of vignettes like this is to illustrate a simple truth: it is entirely possible for Nigel Farage to be the most successful British politician of the last 30 years as well as a man of very small stature. What that tells you about the state we’re in is up to you – I certainly wouldn’t wish to take Farage’s huge achievement from him. But once I’d watched him stand up his own crestfallen footsoldiers like that for some reality TV idiot (Essex, not Trump), I knew he was capable of standing them up in far bigger ways. Of course, he wasn’t my dog in the fight, and as a liberal-metropolitan-elite-whatever I don’t need him like his supporters really, really do. So I now have the luxury of being able to enjoy the show as Nigel attempts to have a second act with an American life. Character is destiny, and I can’t help suspecting that a Nigel Farage this unbound is going to make a fascinating mistake. It may not feel quite as fascinating to those he promised to help – but that’s showbiz, guys. What else did you think this was?

Ogg November 11, 2016 8:45 am EST Print Email Tweet The stock market was indicated to open a bit soft on Friday, but this is after two major reversal days after the Trump victory and the Dow hitting new all-time highs. Friday has equity market participation, but the bond market and banks are closed for Veterans Day. Investors have to act fast since the election, if they wanted to win off the stocks that benefit from Trump and they have seen that the stocks that would win under Clinton have been slaughtered. Even if investors are not that nimble and may have not yet acted, they are still likely looking for new ideas in a market where valuations are high and when interest rates are likely to rise. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports each morning of the week to find new investing and trading ideas for our readers. Some of these analyst research reports cover stocks to buy, and others cover stocks to sell or avoid. These are the top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Friday morning: Archer Daniels Midland Co. (NYSE: ADM) was downgraded to Underweight from an already cautious Neutral rating and the price target was cut to $36 from $42 (versus $45.18 close) at JPMorgan. ADM shares were indicated down 1% at $44.69 on Friday, with a consensus analyst target price of $45.80 and a 52-week range of $29.86 to $47.88. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Genworth Financial Inc. (NYSE: GNW) was raised to Buy from Neutral at Compass Point.

While Donald Trump's election win was a shock, it might actually be positive for the economy Credit: Reuters Sam Brodbeck 12 November 2016 • 7:33am As markets adjust to the idea of Donald Trump as president, a once unthought-of notion is taking hold: his election victory might be the catalyst for the return to “financial normality”. That would mean the resumption of higher interest rates and inflation, a fall in the price of bonds and a resulting rise in their yields, and – most welcome of all – a gradual tilting of the odds back in favour of savers rather than borrowers. Investors have been living in an abnormal world since 2008, when the financial crisis triggered unprecedented intervention by governments and central banks. Their actions turned the rules of saving and investment on their head, with rates plunging so far that, in celebrated cases, some Swedish mortgage borrowers were actually paid interest – while cash-rich savers elsewhere had to pay banks for the privilege of handing over their deposits. These extreme distortions meant investors seeking returns have been pushed into riskier assets – from cash, to bonds, to shares – in their “hunt for yield”. That has made shares expensive, particularly in America, but in Britain and other developed markets too. “We have to seriously consider that we are at some kind of inflection point,” said David Stubbs, a global strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management. “Populism is a runaway train through the developed world – and it’s very hard to stop.” Mr Trump’s brand of populism and campaign promises point to higher Government spending, lower taxation and support for domestic manufacturing. The danger lies in his threats to scrap international trade agreements and a steep rise in national debt as he abandons austerity and borrows. Extrapolating that, said Mr Stubbs, will fuel a rise in prices followed by higher economic growth and “therefore a higher inflation and interest rate world”. Hillary Clinton was ahead in the polls going into the US presidential election Credit: Jewel Samad Jim Leaviss, a bond fund manager at M&G and co-author of the Bond Vigilantes blog, went further. He said Mr Trump’s election was driven by public anger at pitiful wage growth experienced over a decade. Established politicians are increasingly ineffective at solving this, he said, and will either have to abandon the policies that have prevailed since the crisis or face ejection. “Could the vote trigger the end of global austerity?” he said. Contrary to dire predictions, there was no stock market panic following Mr Trump’s election. But bond yields rose –meaning their prices fell – in both Britain and the US, on the expectation that inflation will return. Trump pledges to be 'President for all Americans' Play! 01:26 While share prices might also fall in value to levels nearer their long-term norms relative to company earnings, bond prices are most at risk from a rise in inflation. This is because newer bonds are issued with higher coupons to keep pace with increasing prices. The yield on Treasury 10-year bonds, the benchmark of the American bond market, rose after the election, while the British equivalent, 10-year gilts, have seen increasing yields since the summer. Rising yields have two welcome consequences. Firstly, they “finally tip the scales back in favour of savers”, said Mark Burgess, chief investment officer at Columbia Threadneedle, the fund management firm. Donald Trump wins: what it means for Europe Play! 01:17 Even when the official Bank Rate was stuck at 0.5pc between March 2009 and August 2016, the interest rates banks paid customers continued to fall. Higher bond yields would help company pension schemes, which are crippled by their need to generate income to pay retirees. Another outcome would be higher annuity rates for other pensioners. But the seismic shift could see borrowers paying more for mortgages as rates lift across the board. The early signs of this are already apparent in the capital markets. The rates at which banks raise finance to lend as mortgages, known as “swap” rates, are climbing – and have been doing so for some weeks. The two-year swap, for instance, which reflects loosely the future cost of two-year fixed-rate mortgages, has doubled since August. Several mortgage brokers now suggest that a rise in rates is finally nearing.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 9:20 AM, November 12, 2016 Updated: 11:10 AM, November 13, 2016 NEW YORK - The U.S. banking sector's dramatic rally post Election Day is likely just a taste of bigger gains to come, as investors expect banks to reap huge benefits from rising interest rates and lighter regulation under a Donald Trump presidency. In recent years, bank stocks have been held back by heavy regulation and historically low interest rates which have sapped the earnings potential of their massive cash holdings. But optimism about the sector's outlook is growing. Interest rates are rising and investors are betting that Trump will follow through on his campaign promise to review the increased number of regulations put on the banking system after it nearly keeled over in the 2008 financial crisis. The S&P 500 bank subsector rose 10.2 percent in the three days following Trump's victory in the U.S. presidential election. This was the index's best three-day performance since August 2009. In those three days, Wells Fargo Co shares rose 13.6 percent, JPMorgan Chase & Co climbed 9.5 percent and Bank of America gained 11.9 percent. Some investors and analysts watching banks say the stocks are likely not near the end of their run. "They are not close to being expensive yet," said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group in New York. The S&P 500 banks are currently trading at about 11.2 times forward earnings estimates as a group, up from about nine times in February, when the index hit its lowest since May 2013. Valuation is still well off peak levels of over 33 times earnings estimates in May of 2009, though it trades near levels seen between 2002 and 2008, before many current regulations were put in place. If rates continue to rise and the Trump administration gives some clarity on how regulations will change, then bank valuations "certainly can move higher," Piper Jaffray analyst Kevin Baker said. Baker stopped short of giving a specific P/E estimate but he pointed to the higher valuations of banks that are not designated as systemically important financial institutions, commonly referred to as "too big to fail". Today, the minimum asset threshold for too-big-to-fail designated banks is $50 billion. If this threshold is lifted to $250 billion in a regulatory overhaul it would give a lot more flexibility that could likely boost valuations of banks operating in that range, Baker said. Valuations for too-big-to-fail designated banks are at around 12.5 times forward earnings compared with multiples of 13 to 15 for banks outside of this category, according to Baker. Ed Keon, managing director and portfolio manager of QMA, a multi-asset manager owned by Prudential Financial, said he has been buying into the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund, the ETF that tracks the S&P financial sector, in the last couple of weeks. He is betting on higher interest rates and a pick-up in economic growth. The potential for lighter regulation added to his enthusiasm for the sector. "Of course, no one yet knows exactly what policy changes will occur and exactly how much they will help profits, but I think the benefit might be solid enough that I am maintaining my overweight holdings in the sector,” Keon said.

Find out why. Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Nov 11, 2016 at 6:45PM The stock market finished the week Friday on a mixed note, with the Dow and Nasdaq gaining ground even as the S&P 500 fell slightly. The ambiguous results of the day reflected the ongoing effort among investors to predict economic conditions beyond January 20, when the new president-elect will take office. Some stocks performed quite badly, however, and Newmont Mining (NYSE:NEM), Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM), and Molina Healthcare (NYSE:MOH) were among the worst decliners on the day. Below, we'll look more closely at these stocks to tell you why they did so poorly. Image source: Newmont Mining. Newmont Mining deals with a plunging gold market Newmont Mining finished the day down 9%, reflecting further declines in the gold market. Gold bullion prices fell another $32 per ounce Friday, finishing the week at $1,226 per ounce and brining its losses just since early Wednesday morning to nearly $115 per ounce. Even with the drop, Newmont is taking smart steps to shore up its business, with a tender offer to buy back debt helping to improve its balance sheet. Moreover, today's announcement that the first gold from the company's Long Canyon project got poured earlier in the week points to the potential for higher production from Newmont in the future. By having taken dramatic steps to improve efficiency, Newmont expects all-in cash costs for the mine to be between $500 and $600 per ounce, leaving plenty of profit even if gold prices don't behave well in the near future. ADM deals with political fears Archer-Daniels-Midland dropped 8% after the food processing specialist received a downgrade from analysts at JPMorgan. Already, the results of the presidential election have led to dramatic uncertainty about the future of relations between the U.S. and the rest of the world, and a stronger U.S. dollar against Latin American currencies could make competing countries in South America more attractive to buyers seeking exports than the U.S. markets that Archer-Daniels-Midland serves. As a result, analysts downgraded the stock to underweight, and as future policy becomes clearer, Archer-Daniels-Midland could remain exposed to even greater risks ahead. Molina Healthcare feels a bit ill Finally, Molina Healthcare lost about 6%. The Medicaid-heavy health insurance plan provider has had a tough week, with losses totaling nearly 20% since Tuesday as the future of the Affordable Care Act is under serious threat from the president-elect's imminent policy moves early next year. If new healthcare reform de-emphasizes the role of state Medicaid plans in providing health insurance coverage to Americans, then Molina will have to look closely at its business model to see if it needs to shift away from its focus on government programs and toward greater provision of private healthcare coverage. It's too early to tell exactly what health insurance will look like in 2017 and beyond, but investors in Molina aren't happy with the uncertainty at this point.

The company did not list any pricing information about the offering, but the sheer number of underwriters, as well as the company’s holdings, suggest that the offering will be huge. The company intends to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ATH. The underwriters for the offering are Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Merrill Lynch, BMO Capital Markets, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, RBC Capital Markets, BNP Paribas, BTIG, Evercore ISI, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, UBS Investment Bank, Apollo Global Securities, Dowling & Partners, Keefe Bruyette & Woods, Lazard, Raymond James, Rothschild, Sandler O’Neil and Williams Capital Group. This leading retirement services company issues, reinsures and acquires retirement savings products designed for the increasing number of individuals and institutions seeking to fund retirement needs. It generates attractive financial results for policyholders and shareholders by combining the two core competencies of (1) sourcing long-term, generally illiquid liabilities and (2) investing in a high-quality investment portfolio, which takes advantage of the illiquid nature of its liabilities. The company’s steady and significant base of earnings generates capital that it opportunistically invests across its business to source attractively priced liabilities and capitalize on opportunities. Athene’s differentiated investment strategy benefits from its strategic relationship with Apollo Global Management and its indirect subsidiary, Athene Asset Management (AAM). AAM provides a full suite of services for the investment portfolio, including direct investment management, asset allocation, mergers and acquisition asset diligence, and certain operational support services, including investment compliance, tax, legal and risk management support. Athene’s relationship with Apollo and AAM also provides it with access to Apollo’s investment professionals across the world, as well as Apollo’s global asset management infrastructure that, as of June 30, 2016, supported more than $186 billion of assets under management across a broad array of asset classes.

Frey, as chairwoman of the Frey Foundation board. She is the granddaughter of Edward and Frances Frey, the foundation's founders, whose portraits hang in the lobby of the foundation's offices at 40 Pearl Street NW.Jim Harger | Mlive Media Group  GRAND RAPIDS, MI – The Frey Foundation, which has poured millions into projects throughout western and northern Michigan, announced it has passed the leadership torch to the third generation. Mary Frey Bennett, the 44-year-old granddaughter of the foundation's founders, Edward and Frances Frey, was elected chairwoman of the foundation, replacing her uncle, David G. Frey. With total assets of about $150 million, the Frey Foundation was established in 1974. Edward Frey was the founder of Union Bank, now part of JPMorgan Chase Bank and Foremost Insurance Co., now part of Farmers Insurance Group. "Our foundation encourages officers to relinquish their titles around their 75th birthday," said David Frey, who assumed the chairmanship when his brother, John, retired in 2014. Frey said he and his siblings will remain on the foundation's board as trustees. Third generation trustee Eleonora Frey Zagel, who serves as director of the Family Business Alliance and resides in East Grand Rapids, was elected vice-chair. Trustee Edward J. Frey, Jr. was re-elected treasurer of the board, and third generation trustee Sara Frey Rose, of Harbor Springs, was elected secretary. Bennett, who lives in Gainesville, Fla., has been a board member 2012. Born in Grand Rapids, she graduated from Interlochen Arts Academy and Kalamazoo College, and earned a master's degree in non-profit management. She has worked in the field of philanthropy for two decades. In recent years, the Frey Foundation has been the lead donor behind the development of Rosa Parks Circle, the downtown park that was commissioned and designed by Maya Lin, the artist who gained fame for her design of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. The Frey Foundation has been active in many other West Michigan philanthropic projects, often working with sponsors whose name appears on the side of the buildings. Those co-sponsorships have allowed the foundation to leverage projects in spite of its mid-sized status, Frey said. David Frey was a founding member of Grand Action, the group that raised the funding for the Van Andel Arena, the DeVos Place Convention Center, the Meijer Theater and the Downtown Market. "These projects have had a tremendous catalytic effect," he said, adding the foundation also is participating in the funding for Grand Rapids Whitewater, the campaign aimed at restoring the rapids to the Grand River in the downtown area. The Frey Foundation also has endowed the Edward J. Frey dean's chair at the University of Michigan's Stephen Ross School of Business. "Our legacy is measured by our game-changing grants, the outcomes that have benefitted residents in the communities we serve, and the synergy of our partnerships with other foundations," David Frey said. "This election of new officers is another significant step in the long legacy of the Frey Foundation," said Steven M. Wilson, president of the organization in a statement. "These officers have served on the board of the Frey Foundation for the better part of a decade, learning together, leading together, and working together across generational lines in support of communities throughout our grantmaking region.

Experts say few online protections are available to Delawareans. (Photo: Getty Images) 40 CONNECTTWEET 3 LINKEDIN 2 COMMENTEMAILMORE When it comes to cybersecurity, no one is safe. Not individuals, not large corporations, not the government. Hackers have proven that they can find a way into virtually any system. Once they breach the defenses, their acts often have long-lasting consequences. And some of us are unwittingly opening ourselves up for attack. Connecting the camera in a smart refrigerator to a mobile device is a convenient way to ensure you don't forget milk or eggs at the grocery store. But hackers can access that same camera to look inside the refrigerator, too. They learn when a homeowner is on vacation because expired milk still sits on a shelf, or the fridge hasn't been restocked in a while, making the home a target for robbers. It's not just smart refrigerators that are vulnerable. An increasing number of household appliances – including thermostats, DVRs, baby monitors, home security systems, electric meters and even toasters – are equipped with connectivity that makes life easier, but also exposes its owners to wide-ranging security risks. In two widely reported incidents in 2015, baby monitors were hacked in Kansas and Washington state. Parents in the Washington case were using a camera to watch their son when they heard voices in their child’s room and assumed those voices came from outside the home. It wasn’t until the mother heard a voice from the monitor say, “She’s coming in again” – and noticed the camera move in her direction – that she realized the device had been hacked. In the Kansas case, a mother told police her son’s baby camera followed her movements around the room. Digital devices designed to make our lives more convenient are vulnerable to hackers because they collect huge amounts of data. And that provides a pathway for unscrupulous players to spy on unwitting device owners – and sell consumer shopping data on the black market, which can result in email accounts flooded with dangerous malware. Perhaps most alarming was an attack last month on Dyn DNS, a Manchester, New Hampshire, company that acts an Internet switchboard. Saboteurs were able to transform everyday items such as baby monitors, smart televisions and toasters into online weapons. Hundreds of thousands of these devices were infected with malware designed to flood Dyn DNS with thousands of messages at the same time, knocking out popular websites across the internet. Within minutes, Amazon, Twitter, Netflix and Spotify were all offline. The attacks came in waves. Dyn DNS resolved the first attack by 9:30 a.m., but a second attack was launched around noon and a third breach was reported by the company just before 4:30 p.m. It was around 6:30 p.m. before the company declared the incident over. High-profile attacks, including the recent hacking of the Democratic National Committee's emails, are frequently occurring. And it's not just homeowners that could be victims but local and national groups and corporations. Delaware is home to more than 2,000 financial services companies including some of the largest banking and insurance companies in the world, and some wonder how vulnerable we are. "We are not safe at all," said Adam Levin, a former director of the New Jersey Division of Consumer Affairs and author of an upcoming book on internet security. "Breaches have become the third certainty after death and taxes." Banks and insurance companies store tons of personal information, including account numbers for Social Security, credit cards and birth dates. In the past few years, JPMorgan Chase, HSBC and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York all reported some kind of cyberattack. The schemes varied. In the New York Federal Reserve Bank attack, unidentified hackers pretended to be a legitimate organization and sent fake messages directing the bank to wire almost a $1 billion into a bank account they controlled. Hackers, walked away with $81 million before authorities caught on. Another popular threat is ransomware. Criminals use computers to seize a company's online information until they are paid in bitcoins, which are more difficult to track.  (Photo: Darron Cummings, AP) Insurance companies also have become favorite targets of hackers. Anthem, one of the country's largest health insurers, exposed the data of as many as 80 million customers in a March 2015 hack. Joshua Marpet, who teaches Ethical Hacking and Digital Forensics at Wilmington University, said health care data may be more valuable than financial information. "Hackers can sell your information to someone who doesn't have health insurance, and they can get their broken arm X-rayed, treated and they can leave the hospital happy," he said. "And you can't even get the records because they are still patient-protected by HIPPA laws. It's almost a flawless crime." Identity theft has become so common that if someone is not a victim themselves, they likely know someone who is. Naomi Katz of Wilmington said she called her bank immediately after strange charges in Florida began showing up on her account. She became alarmed after noticing charges against her account ranging from $10 to $15. "They were smart about it because they took out small amounts until they could no longer get away with it," she said. Katz said all of the money was returned to her, but it was a hassle canceling the credit cards. Yet the hack has made her diligent about checking her account more frequently. "I pay attention to my finances," she said. "I go through my accounts and look for things." Lynette Crawford, also a Wilmington resident, said she had not been the victim of identity theft, but she watched a close friend panic after being hacked. Two mysterious charges – one for $100 at a Victoria's Secret store and a $30 gas purchase, both in Miami – appeared on her friend's credit card bill. "The only thing that saved her is that she was able to prove that she was in Delaware, not Miami, at the time of the transactions," Crawford said. "They did return the money." Crawford said she doesn't worry about identify theft and is confident her bank will refund any purchases she didn't make. However, she still checks credit card and financial statements on a regular basis to ensure her identity is safe. 'Internet of things' at risk The average North American home has 13 separate devices connected to the internet, according to a June report from British-based data tracker, IHS Markit. That includes smartphones, tablets, laptops, gaming consoles, televisions, smart appliances and more. In fact, laptop and desktop personal computers account for less than 25 percent of household internet traffic. The explosive use of digital devices has led to the so-called "internet of things" – tech speak for common household objects with connectivity. And their use is growing faster than the ability to defend it. "There is no secure world," said Raymond Holcomb, homeland security adviser for the Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security. "That is a fallacy." A 2014 report by Proofpoint Inc., a Sunnyvale, California, internet security provider, found that more than 100,000 everyday gadgets, including smart televisions, network routers and refrigerators had been compromised to send out more than 750,000 malicious spam emails. In August, two executives of the British-based security firm Pen Test Partners demonstrated the ease in which a hacker could attack a smart thermostat and raise or lower the temperature until a homeowner paid a ransom. "Everyone has antivirus software on their computer, but does anyone run antivirus software on their toaster?" Marpet said. Some of the smart devices rolling off the assembly line come with default passwords that are fairly common. Some companies even uploaded "password" as the default password, making the system even easier for hackers to access. Consumers can adopt some protections, but those measures often reduce the product's effectiveness. Marpet said homeowners can segment their devices away from the internet. The devices can still communicate with each other, but not the internet. "The problem is these devices are most effective when they are on the internet," he said. "How can I see what's in my fridge if I can't access the camera?" Infrastructure attacks  Appliances aren't the only concern, however. Experts say infrastructure in the United States – gas lines, water systems, traffic lights, communications networks – are vulnerable to a cyberattack. While both state and federal officials are working to defend the systems we rely upon every day, resources are limited. "If a cyberwar hasn't quietly already started, the Dyn attack was a shot across the bow from somewhere," said Holcomb, who was a victim of the 2015 data breach of the U.S. Office of Management and Personnel where 18 million government employees' personal information was stolen. Buy Photo Lewis Schiliro, former director of the Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security.  (Photo: SUCHAT PEDERSON/THE NEWS JOURNAL) "Once a cyberwar begins, we are going to have some problems," Holcomb continued. "There are several nation states that have the ability to shut everything down." Lewis Schiliro, former director of the Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security, agreed with Holcomb. "Our infrastructure is the vulnerability we worry about," said Schiliro, who launched Wilmington-based Barrister Global Solutions earlier this year to tackle data breach threats. "It is the biggest national threat we have." Experts disagree on the value of Delaware as a target for sabotage. The number of credit card and financial services companies based in Wilmington would be attractive for someone looking to disrupt the nation's banking industry, some argue. "Bad guys go where the loot is," said John D'Arcy, a professor of information technology risk management and computer ethics at the University of Delaware. "Credit card data is a prime target and that makes Delaware a prime target." But others say the banks with Delaware locations do a good job of ensuring their information is well protected. Representatives from banks with significant Delaware operations – including Capital One, Bank of America, and JPMorgan Chase – declined to be interviewed for this story. "The banks are ahead of the government facilities because they apply so many resources to internal cybersecurity," Holcomb said. "They exchange information with each other on threats." Marpet called Wilmington a "juicy target" for hackers, but noted that internet crime is not geographically motivated and that other targets, such as hospitals and health care providers, could yield greater information. "The entire United States is flush with juicy targets," he said. "I'd rather go after health or life insurance companies because they have Social Security numbers, date of births and everything else." Holcomb said Delaware is working hard to defend against cybersecurity attacks. He did not provide specifics, citing security protocols. Last year, Gov. Jack Markell reactivated the Cybersecurity Advisory Council to share information on risks and practices to keep the state safe. The council works closely with the state's National Guard and Department of Technology and Information. Schiliro added that Delaware works very closely with the federal government and neighboring states. "The coordination between the states and federal institutions is getting a lot of better, and we are able to take advantage of the resources out there," he said. How to protect yourself  There is no perfect method to protecting your online data, experts said. "The world we live in is moving more towards monitoring and damage control because the clock is way past midnight on prevention," Levin said. But a few common sense rules can go a long way. A strong password made up of more than just different symbols and characters, but perhaps a phrase is a good first step. Customers should also demand businesses require a second identification question that changes on a rotating basis. Some companies, including banks and credit cards, already require the extra step of asking a customer for their dog's name or the name of the street where they grew up. "Password cracking tools can still find it, but the more combination of characters you use in a password, it becomes much more difficult to use one of these tools," D'Arcy said. CLOSE Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share We're all guilty of bringing too many gadgets along when we travel. But using local Wi-Fi and public outlets can put you at risk for cyber threats. Here's how to keep your personal information private while traveling. USA TODAY Individuals should also check their credit reports and financial accounts on a daily basis to look for strange transactions or a sudden dip in their credit rating. Of course, disclosing basic information on social media sites can make someone target. At first glance, an online personality quiz may seem harmless, but Levin said hackers are collating your answers to questions about your life to learn potential passwords. "Think of the details you disclose as a nuclear weapon," Levin said. "The individual components may seem harmless, but people are sewing all these bits of information together so they have everything when set against security protocols." The solution, according to Levin, is to lie when your second security check is established. "When it asks for your mother's maiden name, say it's Brown, when it is really Smith," he said. Marpet cautioned against discussing upcoming vacations or evenings out on Twitter or Facebook. He said social media sites that enable users to post where they are at any given moment "a really bad idea." Ordinary citizens need to think hard about what they share online – and constantly check financial, social media and other accounts to ensure that they haven't been hacked. "The bad guys are winning this battle," D'Arcy said. "They only have to be right once. Everyone else has to be right every time."

Ben Schiller 11.11.16 6:15 AM The clocks went back one hour on November 5, ending Daylight Saving Time (DST)—which runs from March to November—for another year. With the exception of Arizona, Hawaii, and some island territories, which don't recognize DST, most Americans got a little more sleep and a little less sunlight. But is this annual spinning of the clocks actually a good idea? Is DST worth all the confusion over what time it is, the inconvenience? [Photo: Loic Djim via Unsplash] DST dates back to Ben Franklin's time and has been championed by everyone from energy conservation experts to barbecue salesmen. Generally, the idea is to maximize sunlight hours when the weather's best, and to encourage commercial activity by keeping us spending longer into the evening. Lobbyists for retailers and the golf industry have been some of the most enthusiastic backers, according to this interesting history. It may be that DST's commercial value is overplayed, though. An analysis by the JPMorgan Chase Institute (JPMCI), based on extensive credit card data, finds that DST spending increases when the period starts but falls by a greater amount when the period ends. The net spending effect is therefore negative, challenging the idea that DST is good for store owners and the leisure industry. "There does seem to be some impact of an additional hour of sunlight on spending. But it ends up being a net negative impact," says Diana Farrell, CEO of the Institute. [Photo: Eder Pozo Pérez via Unsplash] JPMCI compared spending by 450,000 anonymized customers in Los Angeles (which observes DST) and Phoenix (which doesn't). In the 30 days following the start of DST, L.A. saw a 0.9% average increase over four years compared to Phoenix. But in 30 days following DST, it saw a 3.5% decline. The November drop-off was greatest on weekdays, presumably because opportunities to shop are greater on weekends, compensating for fewer daylight hours. California's state Senate considered a bill to end DST earlier this year, but it was defeated. Research shows that switching over in March increases workplace injuries (because people are sleepier). But critics of the measure complained that unilaterally annulling DST would put California out of step with other states. It may be that the commercial argument for DST doesn't hold up as well as people think, even if there are other reasons for keeping it. For one, it's nice to have longer summer evenings, shopping or not. Never miss a story. Sign up for the Co.Exist newsletter and get the best stories delivered to your inbox daily.

STEWART © Benjamin Norman for The New York Times Outside the New York Stock Exchange. Markets generally rally the day after a presidential election. To the long list of pundits who called the election all wrong — as well as its likely consequences — add Wall Street analysts. Quotes in the article Barclays PLC BCS ▲ 10.60 +0.05 +0.47% Caterpillar Inc CAT ▲ 94.44 +0.27 +0.29% Kinder Morgan Inc KMI ▲ 21.83 +0.86 +4.10% JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM ▼ 79.36 -0.15 -0.19% As the presidential election approached, they were falling all over themselves to predict a Hillary Clinton victory and, afterward, a modest stock market rally. The prospect of a win by Donald J. Trump was so remote as to be deemed a “black swan,” an event that was only distantly possible but would have potentially dire consequences for financial markets. Among the many predicting a drop in equity markets in the unlikely event of a Trump victory were analysts at Citibank, JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley. Keith Parker, head of cross-asset strategy research at Barclays, forecast a drop of 11 to 13 percent in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. The hedge fund Bridgewater Associates went even further, warning clients that the Dow Jones industrial average would fall 2,000 points. But then, not only did Mr. Trump win, but American stocks rose. The S.&P. 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq all gained more than 1 percent on Wednesday. By midday Thursday, the Dow had risen more than 0.8 percent, while the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was barely up and the Nasdaq was down 1.26 percent. With benefit of hindsight, what’s extraordinary is how few professional investors saw it coming. Mr. Trump was derided as the candidate of “uncertainty,” which markets typically abhor, and many of his stated policies are vague, incoherent or inconsistent. But there was nothing uncertain about his overall pro-growth, pro-business and America-first tendencies, now backed by the firepower of a Republican House and Senate. He is, after all, a real estate developer. Sign up for the Morning Briefing newsletter “We see tremendous opportunity for economic growth,” said John Engler, a former governor of Michigan who is now president of the Business Roundtable, an influential group of chief executives that was often at odds with Mr. Trump during the campaign, especially over trade and immigration. Now that the results are in, though, Mr. Engler sees a silver lining. “The Republicans understand,” he said, “that they’re on the spot to produce results.” Simon Lack, founder of SL Advisors, an investment advisory firm and operator of a mutual fund that focuses on energy, carried the theme further. “Trump’s win is unambiguously positive” for many sectors of the economy, “especially energy infrastructure,” he said. The doomsayers also ignored a century of market reactions to presidential elections. “We’ve done extensive research that suggests presidential elections don’t affect markets,” said James Stack, president of InvesTech Research. “The reality is that the market is influenced to the greatest extent by economic factors and monetary policy.” “In almost all technical and macro aspects, this is still a bull market,” Mr. Stack said, and Mr. Trump’s election does not change that. Markets generally rally the day after a presidential election, said Jeffrey Hirsch, editor of the Stock Traders Almanac, because elections, whatever their outcome, eliminate a measure of uncertainty. “It doesn’t matter if it’s a Republican or Democrat,” he said. Returns tend to be higher when an incumbent president is replaced or the party in power changes, as happened this week. And previous instances of the election of both a Republican president and Republican Congress have been followed, on average, by a first-year performance of 14 percent. There are more specific reasons as well that investors applauded Mr. Trump’s victory: INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING During the campaign, Mr. Trump said he wanted to “build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, seaports and airports.” If he can get his Republican Congress to go along, that could easily surpass the President Obama’s stimulus plan in the depths of the recession. Mr. Trump has not put a price tag on his proposals, but suggested it could easily top $500 billion. Economists generally agree that government spending can act as a broad economic stimulus as well as a boon for construction companies. The Congressional Budget office estimated that Mr. Obama’s stimulus plan saved 2.1 million jobs in the last quarter of 2009, bolstering the economy by up to 3.5 percent and lowering the unemployment rate by as much as 2.1 percent. Construction company stocks rallied on Wednesday. Shares in Caterpillar, which makes the heavy equipment used in most infrastructure construction, jumped more than 8 percent. TAX CUTS With Republicans in charge, the kind of sweeping tax overhaul and tax cuts long sought by investors seem likely. In many instances, Mr. Trump’s proposed tax cuts go even further than those advanced by House Republicans. He wants to cut the top rate on individuals to 33 percent and cut the corporate rate and taxes on so-called pass-through entities like limited liability companies and partnerships to 15 percent. Whatever their ultimate effect on deficits and interest rates — not to mention worsening income inequality — tax cuts are another form of economic stimulus. “Tax modernization is our top priority,” said Mr. Engler of the Business Roundtable, arguing that it would substantially lift the economy a full percentage point beyond the growth rate of roughly 2 percent a year that it has been stuck in. “We’ve said that if you want to grow gross domestic product by 1 percent, get tax legislation done. The House Republican plan is a great blueprint. One percent growth over 10 years would be $3 trillion.” DEREGULATION Investors and business leaders this week were cheering the likely rollback of a host of time-consuming and costly regulatory measures: crucial parts of the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, environmental regulations and labor protections. “Dodd-Frank has made it impossible for bankers to function,” Mr. Trump said during the campaign. Needless to say, Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and Wall Street nemesis who Mr. Trump mocked as “Pocahontas,” will not have a starring role in a Trump administration. Some of the biggest beneficiaries of deregulation are likely to be banks, drug companies and oil and gas pipelines. On Wednesday, shares in JPMorgan Chase rose 4.6 percent, the biotech concern Biogen jumped more than 8 percent, and the pipeline operator Kinder Morgan rose 4.5 percent. Whether the “Trump rally” persists is another question. In their rush to buy stocks this week, investors seemed all too willing to ignore Mr. Trump’s hostile stands on immigration and free trade, as well as his seeming indifference to the federal deficit and the increased likelihood of higher interest rates. All of those have the capacity to damp growth or even tip the economy into recession. “This is just one day’s reaction,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, who, like many others, was surprised by the strong market rally. “If we get a large stimulus on top of a full-employment economy, it may give you some juice in the near term, but longer term, it’s going to hurt” by driving up interest rates and squeezing out other investments. “I was a strong advocate of deficit spending and tax cuts when unemployment was at 10 percent,” he said. “It doesn’t make sense at 5 percent.” Mr. Parker of Barclays said he expected a sell-off initially, but also called for a recovery by year-end once investors absorbed signals from key economic policy makers. “What we thought would play out over weeks played out over hours,” he said, pointing to Mr. Trump’s early-morning victory speech, which made no mention of trade or immigration, as one catalyst. Like many, Mr. Parker now sees more gains for stocks if a Trump administration stays focused on a tax overhaul and fiscal policy, if real interest rates stay low and if inflation picks up. “The backdrop was and still is generally supportive of risk,” he said.

Treasury Pick Mnuchin Drew Praise, Scorn After IndyMac Deal By Kristin Broughton November 14, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints Risk taker: "He took a company that was a very visibly failed institution of the mortgage crisis and rehabilitated it," an analyst said about Steven Mnuchin's career in banking. Related CIT Hires Consultant to Help Speed Up Turnaround CIT Chief Resists Calls to Shed SIFI Status CIT Appoints HSBC Exec as General Counsel What Bankers Want (and Don't Want) from President Trump 'That's Just Really, Really Bad': Bank CEOs React to Wells Scandal Why Media Representation Matters for Women in Banking Note: This story was originally published Nov. 11, but has been updated following developments Monday. Before Steven Mnuchin became President-elect Donald Trump's likely nominee to lead the Treasury Department, he was a driving force behind one of the most controversial banking turnarounds during the financial crisis. Mnuchin was the top fundraiser for Trump's victorious presidential campaign. That experience has paid off in a big way for the former Wall Street banker, whom Trump's transition team has recommended that he nominate for Treasury secretary, according to a Bloomberg News report citing sources familiar with the process. Other candidates floated in connection with the job included House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling and even JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. Mnuchin, who spent nearly two decades at Goldman Sachs, had drawn attention in recent years for a big gamble he and fellow investors took in commercial banking. He was instrumental in the recapitalization of the failed mortgage lender IndyMac, its return to financial health as OneWest Bank and its ultimate sale to CIT Group in a lucrative deal. He joined the CIT board after the 2015 sale and has since pushed the $66 billion-asset company to slim down and boost returns. How that experience will translate into a career in public service is unclear. Though Mnuchin — who has never held public office — has a track record of success in financial services, there have also been hiccups along the way, including criticism from community groups for ignoring the needs of underserved communities. "He took a company that was a very visibly failed institution of the mortgage crisis and rehabilitated it," said Vincent Caintic, an analyst with Stephens. "He made it into a stable and viable company and sold it successfully for double the money." Caintic said that Mnuchin's experience rehabilitating companies could bode well for a career in government. Additionally, the fact that he worked closely with regulators, negotiating the terms of a failed-bank acquisition, could work in his favor. But memories of Mnuchin's crisis-era move into banking still gnaw at some community activists. Mnuchin in 2009 led a group of Wall Street investors — including George Soros and John Paulson — in rebuilding IndyMac under the OneWest brand. "In some ways, the bank was the poster child for income inequality," said Kevin Stein, deputy director at the California Reinvestment Coalition, noting the disconnect between the high-profile bank investors and borrowers who were struggling during the crisis to pay their mortgages. Stein said that the company generated ill will around its Pasadena, Calif., footprint, in particular, because of foreclosures it made on widows through Financial Freedom, its reverse-mortgage-servicing business. Financial Freedom is currently under investigation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for issues related to its accounting. CIT has discontinued the business. The deal also was one of those that attracted intense scrutiny because of the windfall it generated for private-equity investors, former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chair Sheila Bair has said. Though a nomination is uncertain, especially in as fluid a situation as the days following Trump's stunning win over Hillary Clinton, it would mark a career shift for Mnuchin, a financial executive who has had a somewhat peripatetic career. Mnuchin began his financial services career in 1985 at Goldman, where he ultimately rose to partner and chief information officer. He left the investment banking giant in 2002 and, two years later, established the investment firm Dune Capital Management. Outside of his career in banking, he has also earned a reputation in film. He has helped finance hit movies such as "Avatar." He also briefly served as co-chairman of Relativity Media but resigned last year before the Beverly Hills, Calif., studio filed for bankruptcy. Within the world of bread-and-butter banking, though, Mnuchin has earned a reputation for getting results. Mnuchin decided to enter the business back in 2008, when he saw a TV news shot of customers lined up outside of the $32 billion-asset IndyMac, hoping to withdraw their money. He decided that the time was right to buy a bank, according to a Bloomberg Businessweek story on him. He led a group of investors who bought the assets of IndyMac in 2009, nine months after its blockbuster failure. The group negotiated lucrative terms to a loss-share agreement with the FDIC and within less than a year turned a $1.6 billion profit. As chairman of the newly formed OneWest, Mnuchin helped lead a rapid turnaround. The company moved away from risky mortgage loans and sought to become a more of a "full-service" regional bank with additional branches, according to Caintic. In August 2015, OneWest was sold to CIT, which was run at the time by Wall Street icon John Thain. The deal pushed CIT — another crisis-era turnaround story — above the threshold to be considered a systemically important financial institution. A key priority of Thain was asset growth and burnishing CIT's reputation as a major industry player. But Mnuchin has been influential in pushing CIT to focus, instead, on boosting returns and simplifying its business model. « 1  |  2 »     view entire article Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email Comments Print Reprints JOIN THE DISCUSSION Comment SEE MORE IN National/Regional RELATED TAGS Law & Regulation, Dealmaking & Strategy Comments (0) Be the first to comment on this post using the section below.

Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell in Washington on Thursday. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times WASHINGTON — Vice President-elect Mike Pence will take over as the leader of Donald J. Trump’s transition effort, pushing aside Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, as Mr. Trump moves quickly to assemble a government after his stunning upset victory, the transition team said on Friday. The reorganization puts the urgent task of selecting cabinet officials and key West Wing posts in the hands of Mr. Pence, whose loyalty to Mr. Trump and deep contacts with the Republican establishment on Capitol Hill are seen as critical to navigating the often politically treacherous transition period. But in shuffling those responsible for shaping his administration, Mr. Trump is also keeping close the inner circle of campaign advisers who are deeply skeptical of Washington and who helped design an outsider campaign built on angry and often divisive rhetoric. Stephen K. Bannon, the conservative provocateur and chairman of the Breitbart News website, will be a top transition adviser. Three of Mr. Trump’s adult children and his son-in-law, who were among his closest campaign advisers, will join a 16-member advisory committee to help guide his choices. Rick Dearborn, the chief of staff to Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and a fierce advocate for Mr. Trump, will move from the campaign’s Washington office to help direct the transition operations. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Christie will become a vice chairman of the transition effort, the campaign said. The new inner circle at the transition offices will direct the activities of dozens of corporate consultants, lobbyists and other specialists who will be responsible for recommending candidates for agency jobs across the breadth of the federal government. Some of those advisers come from industries for which they are now in charge of finding top regulators. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “The mission of our team will be clear: put together the most highly qualified group of successful leaders who will be able to implement our change agenda in Washington,” the transition team announced Friday afternoon. The surprise moves will sideline Mr. Christie, who had been in charge of the transition for several months. After Mr. Christie dropped out of the Republican primary race, he became a staunch supporter of Mr. Trump. But his standing has fallen recently as two former aides were convicted in the scandal involving the closing of access lanes at the George Washington Bridge in 2013. In a statement, Mr. Christie said that he is “proud to have run the pre-election phase of the transition team” and said that he looks forward to working with Mr. Pence. “I want to thank President-elect Trump for the opportunity to continue to help lead in this next phase,” Mr. Christie wrote. Photo Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has been mentioned as a possible candidate for secretary of the Treasury. Credit Dylan Martinez/Reuters Two people familiar with the reorganization discussion said Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, had wanted to marginalize Mr. Christie, who had come to recognize that he was not in the running to serve as a top adviser in Mr. Trump’s White House. It was unclear whether concerns about his ability to be confirmed might prevent him from being offered a cabinet post. The changes will also push aside Richard H. Bagger, a former top aide to Mr. Christie who had been working on the transition. The transition team said Mr. Bagger will “return to the private sector” but will remain an adviser. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, and Michael T. Flynn, a retired lieutenant general who has been a top campaign supporter, will also serve as vice chairmen of the transition, the transition team said Friday afternoon. The 16-member advisory committee is made up of four women and 12 men. It will include several members of Congress; Rebekah Mercer, a top Republican donor; Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee; Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal; Attorney General Pam Bondi of Florida; Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive; and Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge-fund manager and Trump supporter. Mr. Bannon will also serve on the committee. A political committee supporting Ms. Bondi received a $25,000 donation from the Trump Foundation, raising questions because it was around the time her office was reviewing allegations against Mr. Trump’s for-profit education programs. “This team of experienced leaders will form the building blocks of our presidential transition team staff leadership roster, and will work with elected officials and tireless volunteers to prepare our government for the transfer of power on Jan. 20,” Mr. Pence said in a statement.

Privacy Policy There are some indications that the transition effort was slow to start, perhaps the result of Mr. Trump’s upset victory, which caught much of the political world by surprise. At least a few of the people helping organize the search for Mr. Trump were tapped at the last minute, while others have been preparing quietly for weeks. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At the Pentagon and the State Department, officials of the Obama administration said on Thursday that they had not yet heard from Mr. Trump’s transition team about beginning the complex work of transferring responsibilities and authority. A spokesman for the State Department said he did not have “any firm word” on when briefings might begin for designated officials from the new government. Several people briefed on the transition process described it as somewhat chaotic after Mr. Trump’s surprise victory on Tuesday. His campaign was led by four leadership teams over 18 months, and most of those people were back in view on Thursday, including Corey Lewandowski, the campaign’s first manager. Mr. Lewandowski is said to have told people he would prefer a White House senior adviser role, although he has also been mentioned as a possible Republican National Committee chairman. Mr. Lewandowski resigned on Friday from his role as a CNN political commentator. Photo Ivanka Trump arriving at Trump Tower on Friday. Credit Ruth Fremson/The New York Times One thing is clear already: those helping Mr. Trump make the decisions are the members of his campaign’s inner circle. On Friday morning at Trump Tower in Manhattan, the president-elect’s closest aides arrived, one by one, waving to the press corps as they entered the elevators. Trump Tower, the president-elect’s residence, has been transformed into a kind of fortress by the Secret Service and the New York police. The building has been ringed by Jersey barriers and concrete blocks marked with “NYPD.” The Secret Service has set up checkpoints on each end of 56th Street near the tower, and pedestrian access has been restricted around the building. With just about 70 days left before the inauguration, Mr. Trump’s administration is largely being assembled behind the scenes. But like much else in the nation’s capital, little stays secret for long. The list of names being mentioned as possibilities for crucial posts in Mr. Trump’s cabinet is growing by the hour, giving official Washington what it craves most: a never-ending parlor game as speculation grows about who might actually get a nod. The latest to be swept into the speculation is Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, who was mentioned as a possible candidate for secretary of the Treasury by CNBC. Officials with the Trump transition team said they reached out informally to Mr. Dimon, who was clear he did not want the post. Aides to Mr. Trump have declined to confirm who is on the short list for cabinet posts. And despite the president-elect’s return to Twitter on Thursday night, he has so far said nothing specific about his possible picks. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The critical position of chief of staff — the gatekeeper for the president inside the West Wing — is expected to come down to a choice between Mr. Bannon and Mr. Priebus. The two men spent more than an hour in a meeting on Friday at Trump Tower. Mr. Giuliani told CNN on Thursday that he might accept an appointment as attorney general, saying that “there’s probably nobody that knows the Justice Department better than me.” Mr. Mnuchin, who served as Mr. Trump’s campaign finance chairman, is said to be a serious contender for Treasury secretary (though Carl Icahn, the investor, and Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, have also been mentioned in the news media).

Facebook Google Investing Analyst Upgrades Bankruptcy Buffett Corporate Governance Corporate Performance Dividends and Buybacks Earnings ETFs and Mutual Funds International Markets IPOs and Secondaries Mergers and Acquisitions Personal Finance Rumors Value Investing Economy Energy Government Regulation Healthcare Housing Jobs Special Report Brands and Products Cities Countries States WildHorse Files for IPO By Chris Lange November 11, 2016 10:05 am EST Print Email Tweet WildHorse Resource Development has filed an S-1 form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding its initial public offering (IPO). No pricing details were listed in the filing, but the offering is valued up to $650 million. The company intends to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol WRD. The underwriters for the offering are Barclays, Merrill Lynch, BMO Capital Markets, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Guggenheim, JPMorgan, Raymond James, Simmons, Tudor Pickering Holt, Capital One, Comerica Securities, Scotia Howard Well and Wunderlich. This is a growth-oriented, independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition, exploitation, development and production of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids resources. Its assets are characterized by concentrated acreage positions in Southeast Texas and North Louisiana with multiple producing stratigraphic horizons, or stacked pay zones, and attractive single-well rates of return. In Southeast Texas, it operates in Burleson, Lee and Washington Counties, where it primarily targets the Eagle Ford Shale, which is one of the most active shale trends in North America. In North Louisiana, this company operates in and around the highly prolific Terryville Complex, where it primarily targets the overpressured Cotton Valley play. WildHorse was formed by management and technical teams and affiliates of Natural Gas Partners, a family of energy-focused private equity investment funds. Prior to formation, the founding members of the management and technical teams successfully built and sold multiple NGP-sponsored oil and natural gas assets in and around the location of its acreage. The company detailed in its filing: Since we commenced operations in 2013, our management and technical teams have successfully executed our development program, growing our acreage position to approximately 375,000 net acres. We have also grown our production from 4.5 MBoe/d for the three months ended March 31, 2014 to approximately 14.0 MBoe/d for the three months ended September 30, 2016, representing a compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of approximately 57%, as described below, and our production for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 17.9 MBoe/d after giving pro forma effect to the Acquisitions. The company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to fund the remaining portion of the Burleson North Acquisition purchase price, repay in full and terminate the WildHorse revolving credit facility and the Esquisto revolving credit facility and repay in full all notes payable by Esquisto to its members, and fund a portion of its drilling program. The remainder will be put toward working capital and general corporate purposes.

(View our Privacy Policy) Mike Pence takes over President-elect Donald Trump's transition team By MICHAEL D. SHEAR, New York Times MICHAEL D. SHEARTampa Bay Times Friday, November 11, 2016 2:41pm Print 0 My Edition I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged Previous Next Previous Next Vice President-elect Mike Pence will take over the job of leading Donald Trump's transition effort, taking the helm from Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, as Trump moves to assemble a government after his stunning upset victory, several people close to the transition team said Friday. Related News/Archive Twitter goes wild over Donald Trump's #airkiss with Mike Pence 4 Months Ago Mike Pence may break with Donald Trump over tax returns 3 Months Ago In introducing Mike Pence, Donald Trump keeps the spotlight on himself 4 Months Ago Christie had been in charge of the transition for the last several months, but the surprise nature of Trump's victory made it critical to move more quickly to assemble a team. The president-elect told advisers he wanted to tap Pence's Washington experience and contacts to help move the process along, the New York Times reported, citing people familiar with the discussions. An executive committee, which will include members of Congress, will advise Pence as the process moves forward. Christie, along with Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, and Michael T. Flynn, a retired lieutenant general who has been a top campaign supporter, will serve as vice chairs of the transition, the sources said. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi on Friday also was named as a member of Trump's top transition team, joining a group of political insiders and newcomers, including members of Trump's family. Trump's administration is being assembled behind the scenes. But like much else in the nation's capital, little stays secret for long. The list of names being mentioned as possibilities for crucial posts in Trump's Cabinet is growing by the hour, giving official Washington what it craves most: a never-ending parlor game as speculation grows about who might actually get the nod. A big revelation may come soon, according to Trump himself, who took to Twitter on Friday morning with some news. "Busy day planned in New York," the president-elect said. "Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government." One thing is clear already: Those helping Trump make the decisions are the members of his campaign's inner circle. At Trump Tower on Friday morning, the president-elect's closest aides arrived, one by one, waving to journalists as they entered elevators to Trump's offices. Those included David Bossie, the deputy campaign manager; Steve Bannon, the campaign chief; and Hope Hicks, the campaign spokeswoman. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York and a staunch Trump supporter, arrived just before 10 a.m., a few minutes after Corey Lewandowski, Trump's former campaign manager who on Friday resigned his position as a commentator on CNN. Brad Parscale, the campaign's digital director, also headed up to the top floors. The latest name to be swept into the speculation maelstrom is Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase. He is said to be a candidate for treasure secretary, according to a report by CNBC, although the banker — who was close to President Barack Obama — has repeatedly denied being interested in the job. The speculation could be short-lived. In 2014, Trump mocked Dimon during an interview with his biographer, Michael D'Antonio. Trump dismissed Dimon, a fellow New Yorker, as being too willing to settle lawsuits — something the president-elect proudly declares he never does. "I watch this guy, Jamie Dimon, settle every case," Trump told D'Antonio, according to transcripts of the interview obtained by the New York Times. When D'Antonio notes that Trump seems "bugged by that," Trump responds that he is. "I can't believe he does it," Trump says. "I can't believe he gives away billions of dollars. He gets sued. I'm dying to sue him so he gives me a billion dollars." Whether that exchange suggests that Trump would not offer the Treasury job to Dimon is unclear. Aides to Trump have declined to confirm who is on the shortlist for Cabinet posts. Despite the president-elect's return to Twitter on Thursday night, he has so far said nothing specific about his possible picks. For now, Trump is firmly ensconced in Trump Tower, where he returned after his whirlwind day at the White House and Capitol Hill on Thursday. Trump Tower has been transformed into a kind of fortress by the Secret Service and the local police. The building has now been ringed by Jersey barriers and concrete blocks marked with "NYPD." The Secret Service has set up checkpoints on each end of 56th Street near the tower, and pedestrian access has been restricted around the building. There are some indications that the transition effort was slow to start up, perhaps the result of Trump's upset victory, which caught much of the political world by surprise. At least a few of the people helping organize the search for Trump were tapped at the last minute, while others have been preparing quietly for weeks. At the Pentagon and the State Department, officials of the Obama administration said Thursday that they had not yet heard from Trump's transition team about beginning the complex work of transferring responsibilities and authority. Although the campaign has been quiet, speculation over potential candidates for administration roles reveals a largely homogeneous circle of middle-aged white men, often wealthy, of open ambition and large personality. The jobs currently generating the most speculation are White House chief of staff (Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus is said to be the leading candidate), secretary of state (former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former United Nations ambassador John Bolton and Sen. Bob Corker are in the mix), secretary of defense (Sen. Jeff Sessions and ex-National Security adviser Stephen Hadley among the possibilities), secretary of the treasury (banker Steve Mnuchin is a maybe) and attorney general (apparently Giuliani's for the taking, though some believe he wants secretary of state). There's a chance some more colorful figures could be invited to join the administration. Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, Kansas Secretary of State and immigration hard-liner Kris Kobach, Trump foreign policy adviser Walid Phares and billionaire investor Peter Thiel have all been rumored as potential appointees. Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke, known for his campaign call for "pitchforks and torches," is seen as a possible secretary of homeland security, alongside more conventional possibilities like Christie or Texas Rep. Mike McCaul. Other likely additions include former Trump primary opponents Ben Carson (secretary of education or health and human services are considered possibilities) and Mike Huckabee (a potential secretary of commerce). Family Research Council senior fellow Ken Blackwell, a prominent social conservative, is leading the transition's domestic policy efforts, positioning him for a similar White House role. Information from the Washington Post and the Associated Press was used in this report.

Economic headwinds could batter big banks, and in case you didn't know, Bank of America stock is a bet on big banks By Dana Blankenhorn, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Oct 7, 2016, 10:06 am EST     Popular Posts: Why Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Is a Post-Election Casualty Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Has a New Path to Bigger Profits Walt Disney Co Is Cutting Its Own Cord (DIS) Recent Posts: Selling Home Depot Inc (HD) Stock? That’s Just Silly. Buffett Bails on Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) Stock. Should You? Fight Deflation With United States Steel Corporation (X), AK Steel Holding Corporation (AKS) View All Posts Shares in Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC) have been on a tear lately. Since hitting their low for the year of $11.11 in February, Bank of America stock is up by one-third. Investors got another chance to buy it at $12.18 in June, but since then, BAC has been on a steady rise, and opened for trading on Oct. 7 at over $16. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr Our Serge Berger likes what he sees, and now has BAC stock on his buying radar. But buying right this second could be a trap. The price-to-earnings multiple on the stock is up to 14, higher than peers like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) or Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC). BofA reports earnings in 10 days, and analysts are hoping for 35 cents p[er share, on revenue of $20.76 billion. That sounds good, but would fall short of last quarter’s 37 cents per share, or the 36 cents per share achieved in the same quarter a year ago — when BAC shares were lower than they are now. Though Bank of America stock’s valuation looks a little better this morning — but only because of a disappointing jobs report that put a damper on interest-rate hike hopes. There also is a global economic storm coming, a financial hurricane that will batter global business, and hurt the bank’s results. Who says so? Bank of America says so. Merrill Lynch’s Warning We are reaching “peak everything.” Those were the words of Michael Hartnett, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch, which Bank of America has owned now for nearly a decade. Bullish trends that have boosted globalization and liquidity look set to reverse, Hartnett’s team wrote yesterday. Politicians are increasingly anti-immigrant and anti-trade. There is a backlash against inequality. The global investment map is being withdrawn. Bonds are out, commodities and equities are back in. That means the value of assets banks like Bank of America hold on their books is due to fall. It means things like oil and gold are going to look like better investments. Market sectors that have underperformed in the past year are due to outperform. Does any of that sound good for Bank of America stock holders? A Political Call It should be emphasized, in a political year, that this is something of a political call, and one that is backward-looking. The Brexit vote, and that government’s decision to pursue an exit from the European Union regardless of the economic consequences, has unnerved markets. The rise of ultra-nationalists across Europe, Asia and the U.S. has bankers battening down the hatches like Floridians before Hurricane Matthew. Political trends can reverse, in response to economic action, but for now other analysts are heeding Bank of America’s warning and downgrading its stock. Vetr has downgraded BAC stock, and Zacks just says “sell.” I am personally more sanguine about the economic outlook than most, because I’m more hopeful about the political outlook. Trends may already be reversing, at least if 538.com is to be believed. That doesn’t mean I’m going to jump on BAC shares this morning. When investors or analysts panic, I like to wait it out before going for bargains. But the price-to-book of Bank of America stock remains 0.7 — dirt-cheap by historical standards, and rising interest rates (eventually) do mean money will get a price. In a few months, BofA might look very interesting. Dana Blankenhorn is a financial journalist who dabbles in fiction, his latest being The Reluctant Detective Travels in Time.

SCHMIDTNOV. 11, 2016 Continue reading the main story Share This Page Continue reading the main story Photo Vice President-elect Mike Pence after meeting with President-elect Donald J. Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell in Washington on Thursday. Credit Al Drago/The New York Times WASHINGTON — Vice President-elect Mike Pence will take over as the leader of Donald J. Trump’s transition effort, pushing aside Chris Christie, the governor of New Jersey, as Mr. Trump moves quickly to assemble a government after his stunning upset victory, the transition team said on Friday. The reorganization puts the urgent task of selecting cabinet officials and key West Wing posts in the hands of Mr. Pence, whose loyalty to Mr. Trump and deep contacts with the Republican establishment on Capitol Hill are seen as critical to navigating the often politically treacherous transition period. But in shuffling those responsible for shaping his administration, Mr. Trump is also keeping close the inner circle of campaign advisers who are deeply skeptical of Washington and who helped design an outsider campaign built on angry and often divisive rhetoric. Stephen K. Bannon, the conservative provocateur and chairman of the Breitbart News website, will be a top transition adviser. Three of Mr. Trump’s adult children and his son-in-law, who were among his closest campaign advisers, will join a 16-member advisory committee to help guide his choices. Rick Dearborn, the chief of staff to Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama and a fierce advocate for Mr. Trump, will move from the campaign’s Washington office to help direct the transition operations. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Christie will become a vice chairman of the transition effort, the campaign said. The new inner circle at the transition offices will direct the activities of dozens of corporate consultants, lobbyists and other specialists who will be responsible for recommending candidates for agency jobs across the breadth of the federal government. Some of those advisers come from industries for which they are now in charge of finding top regulators. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “The mission of our team will be clear: put together the most highly qualified group of successful leaders who will be able to implement our change agenda in Washington,” the transition team announced Friday afternoon. The surprise moves will sideline Mr. Christie, who had been in charge of the transition for several months. After Mr. Christie dropped out of the Republican primary race, he became a staunch supporter of Mr. Trump. But his standing has fallen recently as two former aides were convicted in the scandal involving the closing of access lanes at the George Washington Bridge in 2013. In a statement, Mr. Christie said that he is “proud to have run the pre-election phase of the transition team” and said that he looks forward to working with Mr. Pence. “I want to thank President-elect Trump for the opportunity to continue to help lead in this next phase,” Mr. Christie wrote. Photo Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has been mentioned as a possible candidate for secretary of the Treasury. Credit Dylan Martinez/Reuters Two people familiar with the reorganization discussion said Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, had wanted to marginalize Mr. Christie, who had come to recognize that he was not in the running to serve as a top adviser in Mr. Trump’s White House. It was unclear whether concerns about his ability to be confirmed might prevent him from being offered a cabinet post. The changes will also push aside Richard H. Bagger, a former top aide to Mr. Christie who had been working on the transition. The transition team said Mr. Bagger will “return to the private sector” but will remain an adviser. Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, and Michael T. Flynn, a retired lieutenant general who has been a top campaign supporter, will also serve as vice chairmen of the transition, the transition team said Friday afternoon. The 16-member advisory committee is made up of four women and 12 men. It will include several members of Congress; Rebekah Mercer, a top Republican donor; Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee; Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal; Attorney General Pam Bondi of Florida; Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive; and Anthony Scaramucci, a hedge-fund manager and Trump supporter. Mr. Bannon will also serve on the committee. A political committee supporting Ms. Bondi received a $25,000 donation from the Trump Foundation, raising questions because it was around the time her office was reviewing allegations against Mr. Trump’s for-profit education programs. “This team of experienced leaders will form the building blocks of our presidential transition team staff leadership roster, and will work with elected officials and tireless volunteers to prepare our government for the transfer of power on Jan. 20,” Mr. Pence said in a statement.

Privacy Policy There are some indications that the transition effort was slow to start, perhaps the result of Mr. Trump’s upset victory, which caught much of the political world by surprise. At least a few of the people helping organize the search for Mr. Trump were tapped at the last minute, while others have been preparing quietly for weeks. Advertisement Continue reading the main story At the Pentagon and the State Department, officials of the Obama administration said on Thursday that they had not yet heard from Mr. Trump’s transition team about beginning the complex work of transferring responsibilities and authority. A spokesman for the State Department said he did not have “any firm word” on when briefings might begin for designated officials from the new government. Several people briefed on the transition process described it as somewhat chaotic after Mr. Trump’s surprise victory on Tuesday. His campaign was led by four leadership teams over 18 months, and most of those people were back in view on Thursday, including Corey Lewandowski, the campaign’s first manager. Mr. Lewandowski is said to have told people he would prefer a White House senior adviser role, although he has also been mentioned as a possible Republican National Committee chairman. Mr. Lewandowski resigned on Friday from his role as a CNN political commentator. Photo Ivanka Trump arriving at Trump Tower on Friday. Credit Ruth Fremson/The New York Times One thing is clear already: those helping Mr. Trump make the decisions are the members of his campaign’s inner circle. On Friday morning at Trump Tower in Manhattan, the president-elect’s closest aides arrived, one by one, waving to the press corps as they entered the elevators. Trump Tower, the president-elect’s residence, has been transformed into a kind of fortress by the Secret Service and the New York police. The building has been ringed by Jersey barriers and concrete blocks marked with “NYPD.” The Secret Service has set up checkpoints on each end of 56th Street near the tower, and pedestrian access has been restricted around the building. With just about 70 days left before the inauguration, Mr. Trump’s administration is largely being assembled behind the scenes. But like much else in the nation’s capital, little stays secret for long. The list of names being mentioned as possibilities for crucial posts in Mr. Trump’s cabinet is growing by the hour, giving official Washington what it craves most: a never-ending parlor game as speculation grows about who might actually get a nod. The latest to be swept into the speculation is Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, who was mentioned as a possible candidate for secretary of the Treasury by CNBC. Officials with the Trump transition team said they reached out informally to Mr. Dimon, who was clear he did not want the post. Aides to Mr. Trump have declined to confirm who is on the short list for cabinet posts. And despite the president-elect’s return to Twitter on Thursday night, he has so far said nothing specific about his possible picks. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The critical position of chief of staff — the gatekeeper for the president inside the West Wing — is expected to come down to a choice between Mr. Bannon and Mr. Priebus. The two men spent more than an hour in a meeting on Friday at Trump Tower. Mr. Giuliani told CNN on Thursday that he might accept an appointment as attorney general, saying that “there’s probably nobody that knows the Justice Department better than me.” Mr. Mnuchin, who served as Mr. Trump’s campaign finance chairman, is said to be a serious contender for Treasury secretary (though Carl Icahn, the investor, and Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, have also been mentioned in the news media).

The renminbi gained international acceptance from the International Monetary Fund last year, but it has failed to gain popularity, especially against the heavily traded U.S. dollar which is still considered the true global reserve currency. However, some analysts argue that Trump's protectionist policies and the uncertainty surrounding what path he will take for the largest economy in the world could boost the Chinese currency as a reserve. "No longer is the U.S. dollar the only haven of safety. There is an alternative – renminbi," Daryl Guppy, CEO of Guppytraders financial market training platform, told CNBC on Friday. A strong reserve currency is essentially seen as safe and stable and is held in large quantities by governments and institutions. It also increases the demand for a country's sovereign debt if its currency is widely traded and used. But the fact that investors are unsure of what President-elect Donald Trump will do could make other reserve currencies more appealing. "It is possible that Trump could boost renminbi as a reserve currency as the relative safety of the U.S. dollar comes under question due to the uncertainty surrounding President Trump," Alex Dryden, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management, told CNBC via email on Friday. "Some of Trump's rhetoric surrounding negotiating the U.S. debt burden, for example, could damage the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency," he added. However, even if the Republican victory does boosts the search for other reserve currencies, analysts are not certain that the Chinese renminbi would be the number one option. Mike Segar | Reuters Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in Las Vegas on Oct. 5, 2016. "Trump is likely to encourage a large CNY (Chinese yuan renminbi) devaluation ahead, ironically the opposite of what he wants to see. Once it (the renminbi) finds a more natural - and lower - level, it might become more popular as a reserve, though that will still be tricky unless China runs a trade deficit rather than a surplus," Michael Every, head of financial markets research in Asia-Pacific at Rabobank, told CNBC Friday via email. Every added that to make the renminbi more attractive as a reserve it would need to be at "a fair level, not being subject to constant FX (foreign exchange) intervention, having deep, liquid ‎capital markets to put savings into, having transparency in all government dealings and China running trade deficits." The large number of capital outflows is one of the main drags to the Chinese economy and, according to the International Monetary Fund, this year's outflows should be broadly similar to 2015's as a percentage of GDP (gross domestic product). The IMF said last August that China's trade surplus should be 5 percent of GDP in 2016, largely in line with the level seen last year. "However, it is important to caveat these points with the fact that we don't actually know what policies and changes Trump plans to make," Dryden from JP Morgan said. "We need significantly more detail before we can draw conclusions on the relative stability of the dollar and the change in preference from USD to RMB would not happen overnight, it would be a gradual change over the course of the next few years," he added.

Nov 2016, 02:04 MEZ - Deutsche Märkte öffnen in 6 Stunden 56 Minuten These are the leading credit card processing companiesVon Andrew Meola | Business Insider – Fr., 11. Nov 2016 15:15 MEZ Freigeben 0 Twittern 0 Share0 Drucken Firmen: JPMorgan Chase & Co. Bank of America Corporation Citigroup Inc. AKTUELLER KURS Symbol Kurs Veränderung JPM 79,36 -0,150 BAC 20,16 +0,080 C 55,45 +0,77 WFC 52,59 -0,63 VNTV 56,91 +1,40 (BI Intelligence) Credit card processors are mostly responsible for data transmission and security when you use your card at a store or online to make a purchase. There are two types of processors in the payment-card system. Front-end processors route transactions from merchants to the cardholder's bank to gain authorization; that is, they make sure a customer has enough available credit or funds to make a purchase. Back-end processors are responsible for a fund's settlement, which ends with the merchant receiving a deposit for transactions.  Below, we've outlined the major players in credit card processing and described their major strengths. Bank of America Merchant Services: Bank of America Merchant Services has the advantage of functioning within the second-largest bank in the U.S. The service promises acceptance of all kinds of payments (credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and gift cards), access to funds on the next business day, and mobile support. Citibank:  The consumer division of Citigroup processes transactions in more than 100 currencies. It offers end-to-end processing services, from pricing to transactions, reporting, customer service, and billing. Wells Fargo: One of the "Big Four" U.S. banks, Wells Fargo offers next-business day funding, encryption and tokenization technology, and support for both PIN and signature transactions. Chase Paymentech: The payment processing arm of JPMorgan Chase, the largest bank in the U.S., authorizes and processes payments in more than 130 currencies. And like its peers, it offers analytics, fraud detection, and security solutions. Barclays: Barclaycard payment solutions facilitates in-person, phone, web, and even mail order payments through desktop and portable card machines. Vantiv: Vantiv has been successful thanks to its nearly error-free purchases, authorizations, and captures. In May 2015, it successfully completed 95% of these transactions, ahead of competitors such as Worldpay, PayPal, and Braintree. The company also has a significant speed advantage, as it often processes payments data in less than a second. First Data: First Data facilitates small business payments with its Clover suite of products, including a mini reader that works without Wi-Fi and a mobile reader that attaches to other devices in order to process payments on the go. Cielo: Cielo is the largest Brazilian credit and debit card operator and the largest payment systems company in Latin America. The company debuted on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange in 2010. TSYS: Short for Total System Services, TSYS supports millions of buyers and sellers around the world through four major branches: issuing services, acquiring services, prepaid solutions, and merchant solutions. Global Payments: Global Payments focuses on ensuring businesses accept all major forms of payments. To that end, its services include credit/debit/purchasing cards, electronic check conversion, money transfer, verification and recovery services, gift/loyalty cards, check guarantee, ACH checks, financial EDI services, and point-of-sale equipment. Worldpay: The UK-based company is one of the longest-tenured online payment platforms. The company provides several payment services for both online and in-store channels. As of August 2016, the company had 400,000 merchant clients. In 2015, it processed 13 billion transactions valued at more than $526 billion. Worldpay has grown its volume primarily because of early-mover advantages that have allowed it to build scale. It also provides many different services across channels, which diversifies its revenue streams.  Moneris: Moneris is the largest credit and debit card processor and acquirer in Canada. It processes more than three billion transactions each year for more than 350,000 merchants, and the company employs more than 1,900 people in North America. Fiserv: American Banker and BAI ranked Fiserv third by revenue among technology providers to U.S. banks in October 2015. Fiserv provides services in account processing, electronic payments processing, check processing, web and mobile banking, and more. Adyen: Adyen provides e-commerce companies with a payment platform that includes gateway, risk management, and front-end processing services. Adyen is a full-stack gateway and has famous merchants like Facebook and Spotify as clients. The company has brought in merchants thanks to its single platform that can support payments in any channel across 100 different payment methods and 200 countries. The firm processed $50 billion in 2015, up 100% from $25 billion in 2014. It earned $350 million in revenue in 2015, and expects to break $500 million in 2016.  Heartland Payment Systems: Heartland helps businesses move beyond accept ng major credit cards. The company facilitates payment processing in-store, online, and offsite through multiple methods, such as EMV, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Android Pay, and gift cards. It also offers next-day funding, real-time reporting, and 24/7 customer service in the U.S. Elavon: Formerly known as NOVA, this company is a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp. Elavon processes payments in more than 30 countries for more than one million merchants. More to Learn These card processors handle so much volume and so many dollars every day, but they are still just one piece of the larger payments ecosystem, which includes issuers, merchants, and more.

"Following" : "Follow"}} November 11, 2016 9:38am   Comments Share: Related NTDOY Want To Invest In Social Momentum? New ETF Paves The Way Nintendo Just Revealed 3 New Pieces Of Info Regarding The New 'Super Mario Run' Game Nintendo to sell 'Super Mario Run' for $9.99 (Seeking Alpha) JPMorgan said in a note on Friday that it believes expectations for Nintendo Co., Ltd (ADR) (OTC: NTDOY)'s Switch hybrid console is still low. Switch: Key To Medium-Term Potential Analyst Haruka Mori said she believes Switch is key to the company's medium-term potential. The analyst noted that the company will announce details of the Switch on January 13. Delving on the product, the analyst said neither the pricing nor the title lineup will disappoint and that the key to the Switch's medium-term potential is the new user experience. Details on user experience will also unveiled in January, the analyst said. New User Experience Is The Appeal JPMorgan believes the company's follow up with hands-on promotional events will allow Switch's potential to start being reflected in the stock price ahead of the launch. The firm also thinks Switch will have Nintendo's characteristic family appeal, given its emphasis on anytime/anywhere multi-player gaming. The firm sees the new user experience as the key to lure young and hard core gamers carrying multiple devices to take on one ore product. According to the firm, there is likely to be close links between the Switch and Nintendo's upcoming smartphone games, which launch from December, beginning with Super Mario Run. Revising Forecast, Raising Price Target Based on contact following the second quarter results and updated product information, the firm revised its forecasts for Nintendo. JPMorgan believes the shares of Nintendo are highly attractive, as market expectations for the upcoming Nintendo Switch hardware product, scheduled to be launched in March 2017, remain muted. The firm raised its price target for Nintendo shares to 30,000 yen from 28,000 yen, based on its revised forecasts and valuation assumptions. The firm remains at Overweight on the shares.

Profit taking may contribute to some early weakness on Wall Street after the Dow reached new record highs in the previous session. Nonetheless, trading activity may be somewhat subdued due to the Veterans Day holiday. Following the broad based rally seen on Wednesday, stocks turned in a mixed performance during trading on Thursday. While the Dow advanced to a new record closing high, the tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day firmly in negative territory. The Dow jumped 218.19 points or 1.2 percent to 18,807.88 and the S&P 500 rose 4.22 points or 0.2 percent to 2,167.48, but the Nasdaq slid 42.28 points or 0.8 percent to 5,208.80. The jump by the Dow was partly due to substantial gains by JPMorgan (JPM) and Goldman (GS), which was indicative of strength throughout the financial sector amid optimism about reduced regulation under Trump. Reflecting the strength in the financial sector, the Dow Jones Banks Index soared by 4.7 percent and the NYSE Arca Broker/Dealer Index shot up by 3.7 percent. Dow component Pfizer (PFE) also posted a standout gain after a report from Reuters said the drug giant is evaluating a potential sale or spin-off of its consumer health division that could value the unit at as much as $14 billion. Along with financial stocks, biotechnology, oil service, transportation, and steel stocks also added to recent gains amid optimism they will benefit in the new Trump administration. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) posted notable losses on the day, weighing on the tech-heavy Nasdaq. Gold stocks also came under pressure, dragging the NYSE Arca Gold Bugs Index down by 7.8 percent. The weakness in the sector came as the price of gold for December delivery slid $7.10 to $1,266.40 an ounce. Significant weakness was also visible among utilities stocks, which have fallen sharply along with treasuries following Trump's upset victory. Semiconductor, software, internet and stocks also showed notable declines, reflecting overall weakness in the tech sector. On the U.S. economic front, the Labor Department released a report before the start of trading showing a bigger than expected drop in initial jobless claims in the week ended November 5th. The report said initial jobless claims fell to 254,000, a decrease of 11,000 from the previous week's unrevised level of 265,000. Economists had expected jobless claims to edge down to 263,000. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures are falling $0.84 to $43.82 a barrel after sliding $0.61 to $44.66 a barrel on Thursday. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,259.50 an ounce, down $6.90 from the previous session's close of $1,266.40 an ounce. On Thursday, gold dropped $7.10. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 106.45 yen compared to the 106.83 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.0902 compared to yesterday's $1.0893. Asia Stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Friday following the mixed closed on Wall Street overnight. China's Shanghai Composite Index rose 24.76 points or 0.78 percent to 3,196.04, a 10-month high, after news that the long-awaited Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect will be officially launched on November 21st. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled 308.02 points or 1.35 percent to 22,531.09. Japanese shares ended a tad firmer as the dollar continued to rise against the yen on expectations of expansionary fiscal policy under Trump. The Nikkei 225 Index edged up 30.37 points or 0.18 percent to 17,374.79, taking its gain for the week to 2.8 percent. The broader Topix index closed 0.14 percent higher at 1,378.28. Financials led the gainers amid the rise in U.S. Treasury yields. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial, Japan's largest bank, soared as much as 9 percent, Mizuho Financial rallied 3.7 percent and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial climbed 4.1 percent. Mitsubishi Materials Corp shares soared 7 percent after London copper prices jumped 4 percent to hit their highest level in nearly 16 months on Thursday. However Pioneer Corp slumped 8.4 percent after the car electronics maker reported a net loss for the second quarter. Australian shares eked out modest gains, as stronger commodity prices lifted miners and financials also gained ground on expectations of higher interest rates globally. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 moved in a tight range before seeing a late surge to end the session 41.90 points or 0.79 percent higher at 5,370.70. The broader All Ordinaries Index climbed 37.70 points or 0.70 percent to finish at 5,446.60. Europe The major European markets have also turned mixed over the course of the trading session. While the German DAX Index has risen by 0.4 percent, the French CAC 40 Index is down by 0.5 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index is down by 1.2 percent. After digesting Donald Trump's historic victory, investors are now taking stock of his positions on a range of domestic and foreign policy issues. Donald Trump winning the U.S. presidential election is a major event, but it is too early to say if that will affect the Federal Reserve's policy decision in December, European Central Bank Executive Board member Benoit Coeure said today. "It is not for the ECB to assess the political consequences," Coeure said in an interview to the newspaper Le Progrès de Lyon and other French newspapers. Brexit worries also returned to the fore after some members of Parliament told the BBC they are prepared to vote against triggering Article 50. On a light day on the economic front, final data from Destatis showed that German consumer inflation climbed an annual 0.8 percent in October, a two-year high and faster than the 0.7 percent rise seen in September. At the same time, the wholesale price index increased for the first time in more than three years. Wholesale prices climbed 0.5 percent in the month from last year, reversing a 0.3 percent drop in September. U.S. Economic Reports The University of Michigan is scheduled to release its preliminary report on consumer sentiment in the month of November at 10 am ET. The consumer sentiment index is expected to inch up to 87.5 in November from 87.2 in October, which matched the low recorded last September. Stocks in Focus Entertainment giant Disney (DIS) reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings and revenues that came in below analyst estimates amid a drop in ESPN subscribers. However, CEO Bob Iger forecast a return to robust growth in fiscal 2018 and beyond. J.C. Penney (JCP) reported a third quarter loss that matched analyst estimates but on weaker than expected sales. The retailer also lowered its forecast for full-year comparable store sales growth. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NVDA) reported better than expected third quarter results and provided upbeat guidance. The graphics chip maker also announced a $2 billion stock buyback and a 22 percent dividend increase. High-end department store Nordstrom (JWN) also reported third quarter results that exceeded analyst estimates and raised its full-year profit forecast. Waste Management, Inc. (WM) announced the appointment of James Fish, Jr. as president and chief executive officer. Fish succeeds David Steiner as the chief executive. Shares of Photronics (PLAB) are moving sharply lower in pre-market trading after the semiconductor equipment maker slashed its fourth quarter guidance. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates Vodafone Slips To Pre-Tax Loss On Hefty India Charge; Narrows FY View Merck KgaA Lifts FY16 Earnings View As Q3 Results Climb, Stock Up Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone Amaya Gets Huge Buyout Bid From Former CEO Zuckerberg: Facebook Hoax News Did Not Get Trump Elected Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Siemens To Buy Mentor Graphics For $4.5 Bln Enterprise Value Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy ADAP Surges As FDA Lifts Clinical Hold, OCUL Catches Eyes, RegeneRx On The Rise AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America ANTH Plunges As Lupus Trial Fails, BMY's Opdivo Is At It Again, FDA Nod For GILD Pfizer : IBRANCE Approved In Europe To Treat HR+/HER2- Metastatic Breast Cancer Engie 9-month EBITDA Declines - Quick Facts FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Google Rejects EU Antitrust Charges Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Walmart Introduces Black Friday 2016 Deals; Walmart App's Deals Start Today Vivendi Turns To Profit In Q3, Revenues Up; Maintains View K+S Group Posts Q3 Negative EBIT I; Cuts 2016 EBIT I View Frankfurt Airport Oct.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search Skip to Navigation Skip to Main Content Skip to Related Content 0 Mail News Home Follow Us US World Politics Tech Science Odd News ABC News Yahoo Originals Katie Couric Matt Bai In wake of Trump win, focus may drift back to Fed and inflation By Sumanta Dey ReutersNovember 11, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share View photos U.S. President elect Donald Trump speaks at election night rally in Manhattan, New York, U.S., November 9, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File PhotoMore By Sumanta Dey BENGALURU (Reuters) - After Donald Trump's unexpected victory in the U.S. presidential election, investors may refocus in the coming week on the health of the world economy and any signs that years of rock-bottom interest rates and fiscal austerity are coming to an end. Trump's victory poses a major challenge to the conventional wisdom on the global economy, which for years has relied on brisker cross-border trade and migration flows for growth. Apart from a nearly across-the-board rise in sovereign bond yields, however, the markets have so far mostly shrugged off the election result - despite previous fears of a meltdown in the event of victory for Trump, who espoused fiercely protectionist positions on trade in his campaign. Even the long-held view that the Federal Reserve will raise rates next month, a year after its initial step in that direction, hasn't budged at all. Fed Chair Janet Yellen's testimony to Congress on Thursday may set the stage for a year-end hike, despite the mild tightening in financial conditions in the past week. Everything is up for reassessment. "It will take time to gauge the global economic consequences of Donald Trump's surprise victory," JP Morgan's chief global economist Bruce Kasman wrote in a note. "Forthcoming policy changes are likely to generate growth cross-currents, but they should reinforce the tilt toward global reflation." Trump's proposals represent both a negative supply shock from curbs on trade and immigration as well as a positive demand shock from new fiscal spending, he added. With the U.S. economy close to full employment - the jobless rate was 4.9 percent in October - Trump's election promise to cut taxes and upgrade the country's aging infrastructure could provide a big boost to both growth and inflation. Official U.S. data on Thursday will likely show consumer price index inflation picked up slightly last month, up 0.4 percent on the month and 1.6 percent on the same month last year. Core inflation, which strips out food and energy, is expected to hit 2.2 percent. That follows pre-election news of a pickup in average pay growth to 2.8 percent, the highest since June 2009. Retail sales data due out on Tuesday are expected to have lost a little steam last month. INFLATION AHOY Sovereign bond markets are already out of the blocks in pricing in a rise in inflation expectations in the United States followed by the rest of the world. The 10-year U.S. yield rose to 2.15 percent, almost 30 basis points above its levels around 1.86 percent just before the U.S. election on Tuesday. The surge has strengthened the dollar against the euro and yen, which would ultimately help raise import costs in the euro zone and Japan. If inflation moves higher from here, supported by fiscal stimulus and rising energy prices, the current back-up in bond yields across the developed world is set to continue, possibly suggesting an end to a three-decade trend of falling yields. It is still early days, however. Starting on Monday, it will become clearer how industrialized economies such as the euro zone, Germany, Italy, and Japan fared in the third quarter - before the U.S. political earthquake. Reuters polls show growth largely held steady in the euro zone despite a slowdown in Germany, and picked up slightly in Japan. Inflation was probably 0.5 percent in October in the euro area, similar to a preliminary reading but above recent lows. The gradual rise in inflation in recent months will be welcome news for the European Central Bank which, after printing more than a trillion euros since March 2015 and cutting deposit rates to -0.4 percent, is fast seen running out of policy tools. The ECB's Governing Council next meets on Dec. 8 to decide policy. Economists expect it to extend its asset purchase program beyond the planned end date of March 2017. YELLEN'S FUTURE A snap Reuters poll conducted in the 24 hours after the U.S. election result indicated no change at all in the expected future path for the policy rate. A series of Fed policymakers are scheduled to speak in the coming week and are likely to reinforce the view that the fed funds rate will move up 25 basis points to a range of 0.50-0.75 at the Dec. 13-14 meeting. Crucial too for the rate trajectory is the future of Janet Yellen, appointed by President Obama as Fed Chair. A Reuters poll a few days ago found a majority of economists expect Yellen to serve out the remainder of her term until early 2018 but don't think she will be reappointed. "What is relatively clear is that there will be conflicts between a Trump administration and Fed Chair Janet Yellen after Trump had severely attacked Yellen in his election campaign. The bridges between both of them appear to have been burnt," Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank, wrote to clients. Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May is scheduled to travel to Berlin on Nov. 18, a trip in which she possibly hopes to get preliminary talks underway that would help the UK smoothly navigate the process of leaving the European Union.

While some analysts have been calling this a knee-jerk reaction others simply feel that investors will wait and watch for clues from Mr. Trump's presidency. "Short term, financial markets should learn a lesson of Brexit – which is that even political earthquakes with profound economic consequences do not change the world overnight, or in a predictable fashion," Stephanie Flanders, chief European market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management told CNBC via email. "In the short-term, the best thing that most investors can do will be to sit tight and look for clues from Trump's first few weeks." Getty Images Republican president-elect Donald Trump delivers his acceptance speech during his election night event at the New York Hilton Midtown in the early morning hours of November 9, 2016 in New York City. However, some analysts have told CNBC that the markets will soon move away from the Trump Trade and focus on the events in Italy as the risk event for markets globally. "The upcoming Italian referendum this December may create volatility across markets as the year draws to a close," Maria Paola Toschi, global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management told CNBC via email. She further added that the referendum on Senate reform is considered a political test for Italy. "A victory of yes could reinforce the empowerment of the current coalition on an ambitious program of reforms. The victory of no could open a period of uncertainty on the political stability of the current coalition that has been always strongly committed on reforms." Impact on Europe? Many analysts have warned that the result of the Italian referendum could have global implications. A defeat in the referendum for Italy could lead to social turmoil in other countries that are already facing a strong resistance to changes with elections across Europe that will take place next year. At present, any Italian law needs to be approved by both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate, often resulting in delays in effecting new laws and reforms. However on December 4, the Italian public will get to decide whether they want to stick with the old or shake things up, by restructuring the legislative process by effectively reducing the second chamber's power. Other uncertainties around the referendum involve the country's Prime Minister, Matteo Renzi who has said in previous months that he would resign and abandon politics if the constitutional reforms were not passed. "There is certainly a lot of interest on the upcoming Italian referendum and what its result may mean for the future of Europe's political stability. Although political events can create volatility in the short term, it is important for investors to focus on the fundamentals and long term drivers of the markets," JP Morgan's Toschi told CNBC. show chapters <p>The Italian referendum is not Brexit: Intesa Sanpaolo CEO</p> <p>Intesa Sanpaolo CEO, Carlo Messina takes a look at the upcoming Italian referendum in light of the anti-establishment rhetoric seen across the globe.</p> The Italian referendum is not Brexit: Intesa Sanpaolo CEO    Wednesday, 9 Nov 2016 | 6:07 AM ET | 02:49 However, some analysts think the Italian referendum may not get as much coverage. Ana Thaker, a market economist at PhillipCapital UK says the build-up to the Italian referendum is unlikely to be as significant as the U.S. election. Thaker however warns that it should not be underestimated, adding that it could be as "significant as Brexit. Britain's decision to leave the European Union was the first sign of trouble in the union, if Italy decides to leave, it is confirmation that the union is in trouble and could spark a long-term market rout which European equities would suffer from the most." The Italian government bond yields meanwhile have hit their highest level in over a year in the run-up to a ratings review and a planned auction while as investors look to the upcoming constitutional referendum. But Carlo Messina, CEO of Intesa Sanpaolo told CNBC Tuesday that the Italian referendum is not Brexit 2.0. "The referendum is not Brexit. It is not leave or remain into euro zone. It is a change of a constitutional law so it can change or create the instability, some volatility but something that can affect the trend or reform within the country. There is an exaggeration on the approach outside of Italy on the results of the referendum." Follow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook.

Donald Trump used this to attack Clinton, saying she was “owned by the banks.” But he was “not going to let Wall Street get away with murder,” he said earlier this year, and he pledged to tax the financial industry. Even so, his victory in the presidential election is seen by investors as the best possible thing to happen to the big banks. The share price of Goldman Sachs has rallied about 5% since the vote, to the highest in a year. JPMorgan Chase’s share price is the highest it’s ever been, and Wells Fargo stocks are now higher than before the fake-accounts scandal broke. Traders and bankers are taking to heart Trump’s campaign promise to cut bank regulation. His new website as president-elect specifically targets the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act and says it will be dismantled when he’s in office. The Dodd-Frank act includes hundreds of rules passed after the financial crash to make banks stronger and safer. Banks had to spend a lot of money adapting to the new regulation and have had to set aside more and safer assets for their balance sheets. If this law is scrapped, it’ll be easier for them to go back to making the risky trades that make the most money. Another boost to banks’ bottom lines is the expectation that Trump’s fiscal stimulus will increase inflation, while the Federal Reserve will stick to its plans to raise interest rates. This has pushed up the yields on bonds and other interest rates. As banks make money on the margin between the assets they borrow and lend, higher rates are great for their profits. Morgan Stanley analysts said a 1% rise in rates would increase big banks’ per-share earnings by 5.5%. There’s also speculation Trump will bring Wall Street into the heart of his cabinet. His likely pick for Treasury Secretary is Steven Mnuchin, the campaign’s chief fundraiser and a 17-year Goldman Sachs veteran. He had key roles in investment bank’s mortgage operations before starting a hedge fund with backing from George Soros. And then there’s Trump’s support of the most financially risky bank in the world: Deutsche Bank. Since 1998, the German bank has helped loan at least $2.5 billion to companies affiliated with Trump, according to the Wall Street Journal (paywall). Deutsche Bank’s share price was near a record low before the election as it faces billions of dollars of legal fines from the financial crisis and fears that its balance sheet is too weak. But Trump’s victory has delivered a boost to the stock of even this struggling bank. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

But some experts warn that there's not much room left for the banks to run. Banks have rallied to a combination of the massive rally in U.S. bond yields since Trump's victory — the 10-year Treasury yield has surged 23 percent since Wednesday — and the belief that the Donald Trump administration will bring less regulation in the banking industry. In a note published Thursday, Michael Block, chief strategist at Rhino Trading Partners, wrote that the banks are "trading like Dodd-Frank and the Volcker rule have already been wiped out of existence and that we are partying like it's 2006." JPMorgan, one of the largest components in the XLF, touched an all-time high in Thursday trading. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America both rose 4 percent. Trump's presidential transition team said in a Wednesday statement that it would "dismantle" the Dodd-Frank Act, the legislation passed in 2010 that brought significant regulation upon the banking industry following the financial crisis. In another potentially bullish sign, sources told CNBC's Kate Kelly that JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has been considered for the role of treasury secretary under Trump. But the notion that the sector will see less regulation and thus become more attractive doesn't make much sense to Dennis Davitt, managing director at Harvest Volatility Management, who said in an e-mail to CNBC that such an act would take "years." "Even if they were to repeal Dodd-Frank tomorrow, for the banks to get back in motion … they've spent the last eight years growing out their compliance departments. They're not growing out their proprietary trading departments," Davitt said Thursday on CNBC's "Power Lunch." Rather than owning the XLF outright, he suggests playing the banks more nimbly, by using options. "There's real smart money out there buying upside inexpensive calls in the banks. If they continue to defy gravity, it's a great options to own. And if you own these banks, if you were fortunate enough to call this all right, buy some puts against your positions," he said. The buying opportunity may lie in the coming weeks, according to Matt Maley, equity strategist and technical analyst at Miller Tabak. "The group is up incredibly in the last three months, and it's getting very extended," Maley said Thursday on "Power Lunch." Maley said the he wouldn't "chase" the group at this point, deeming them overbought, largely because the bond market is getting "incredibly oversold and incredibly over-hated." Rising rates tend to help the banks, as higher yields generally mean that the difference at which banks can borrow and at which they can lend grows.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    President-elect Donald Trump is translating some of his populist campaign rhetoric into policy statements, including the contention that the Dodd-Frank Act should be scrapped because it has made Wall Street banks an even bigger threat to the nation’s economy and working families. After the government’s answer to the 2008 financial crisis, the “big banks got bigger while community financial institutions have disappeared at a rate of one per day, and taxpayers remain on the hook for bailing out financial firms deemed ‘too big to fail,’” says a statement posted on Trump’s official transition website. “The Financial Services Policy Implementation team will be working to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation.” U.S. bank stocks climbed for a second straight day on Thursday as investors bet a Trump presidency will lead to less regulation and sideline industry critics in Congress led by Senator Elizabeth Warren. The 24-company KBW Bank Index advanced 3 percent at 3:16 p.m. in New York, led by Wells Fargo & Co., which rose 7.4 percent. Bank of America Corp. advanced 4.5 percent, while JPMorgan Chase & Co. climbed 4.4 percent. Trump Antagonist The call to scrap Dodd-Frank isn’t likely to go over well with Warren, the Wall Street scourge and Trump antagonist who said Thursday that she’d be willing to work with the incoming administration to enact economic and banking policies so long as he didn’t loosen existing rules. In remarks prepared for an AFL-CIO labor federation event in Washington, Warren cited issues they agree on, including the need to curtail Wall Street influence in politics, reinstate Glass-Steagall Act limits on banking activities and reform trade deals. “When President-elect Trump wants to take on these issues, when his goal is to increase the economic security of middle-class families, then count me in,” the Massachusetts Democrat said on Thursday. “I will put aside our differences and I will work with him to accomplish that goal.” In addition to repealing Dodd-Frank, Trump’s transition website outlines several policies that will be familiar to those who followed his campaign, including calls for a moratorium on new rules so existing measures can be reviewed. It also broadly addressed a tax-code overhaul, saying Trump’s plan “can be summarized as lower, simpler, fairer, and pro-growth.” The new administration’s plans for financial regulation could pull from a proposal released earlier this year by Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Texas Republican who leads the House Financial Services Committee. His bill -- dubbed the Choice Act -- calls for ripping up core parts of Dodd-Frank, including a provision that empowers the government to dismantle failed banks. He also wants to do away with Volcker Rule restrictions on banks’ trading and investments, and to weaken the reach of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Warren’s pledge offers a first glimpse of a strategy she may use next year when Republicans control the White House and both chambers in Congress. “Americans want to hold the big banks accountable,” Warren said. “If Trump and the Republican Party try to turn loose the big banks and financial institutions so they can once again gamble with our economy and bring it all crashing down, then we will fight them every step of the way." © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.
