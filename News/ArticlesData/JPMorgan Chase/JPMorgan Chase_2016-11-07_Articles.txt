Options traders have become more bullish on the yen as the election nears, while hedge funds wagered since early January that the currency will gain. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and HSBC Holdings Plc say that neither Democrat Hillary Clinton or Republican Donald Trump will favor a stronger dollar, so any short-term fluctuations in the yen as the vote nears are likely to give way to gains for the Japanese currency over the longer term. An expected Federal Reserve rate increase also may already be priced in. “Regardless of which candidate becomes president, U.S. policies are expected to be more protectionist and keep a cap on the dollar,” said Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan markets research at JPMorgan in Tokyo. There is another reason for the dollar rally to wane, he said. “If the Fed does raise interest rates in December, it will likely follow the same pattern as last year where the dollar and U.S. yields rose until a rate increase and then declined.” Japan’s currency slid 1.3 percent to 104.46 per dollar on Monday, erasing much of its gains from last week, after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it was sticking by its finding that Hillary Clinton didn’t commit a crime in her handling of e-mails. It was a fresh reminder for investors of the market’s volatility amid the final days of the election campaign as the euro and the Swiss franc also dropped, while Mexico’s peso soared. The most accurate currency forecasters saw steeper gains in the yen should Trump win than declines in the event of a win for Clinton, in a survey by Bloomberg News. Despite futures signaling 80 percent odds for a Fed interest-rate increase in December, the dollar faltered against the yen last week with its steepest slide since July. The yen fell in November 2015 before rebounding in December, when the U.S. central bank hiked borrowing costs for the first time in a decade. Its 15 percent surge this year is the strongest performance among Group of 10 currencies. Click here for how the top forecasters expect the dollar to react after the vote Currency options indicate traders are more concerned about yen gains than declines. The cost to protect against an advance in Japan’s currency rose to the highest since June on Monday, relative to the cost to insure against dollar strength, one-month risk reversals show. The yen was at 104.46 per dollar as of 1:26 p.m. in Tokyo Tuesday. Meanwhile, analysts are sticking with their forecasts. The median projection from strategists surveyed by Bloomberg has the currency rising to 103 per dollar by March 31. That level hasn’t shifted since analysts last boosted their yen estimates early last month. Wagers from leveraged funds for the yen to gain against the dollar exceeded bets on declines as of Nov. 1 by 28,114 contracts, according to the latest data available from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The net longs peaked in September at an eight-year high of 64,179 contracts. HSBC also sees the dollar’s recent rallies making the currency prone to declines.  “Both candidates favor a weak dollar, so dollar selling may gain momentum after the election,” said Shuji Shirota, head of the macroeconomic strategy group at HSBC Securities Japan Ltd. in Tokyo. “The risk of the dollar falling below 100 yen will heighten towards the end of the year and into next year.” The Japanese currency’s strength faces some headwinds from local bond investors, especially after its advance stalled over the past two months or so when it bounced off the 100 per dollar area, a level Deutsche Bank AG sees as key for some of Japan’s biggest money managers. That’s led institutional investors, including life insurance companies, to express interest in boosting unhedged foreign bond investment in the second half of the fiscal year, meaning they would be selling yen to buy dollars when they purchase debt abroad. Deutsche Bank AG sees 100 yen as crucial for life insurers. “Life insurers may help support the dollar/yen by boosting unhedged foreign bond purchases if views are sustained for the pair to hold above 100,” said Taisuke Tanaka, Deutsche Bank’s chief currency strategist and head of fixed-income research in Tokyo. “But, if the dollar falls deep below 100 yen, they could accelerate dollar selling in order to boost hedging ratios on foreign bonds they already hold.” JPMorgan’s Sasaki also regards 100 yen as a key level. “Life insurance companies may be more proactive in unhedged foreign bond investment if they see the dollar is firming around 100 yen, and such a view may actually be a factor behind the relatively solid dollar-yen,” Sasaki said. “Their stance may be one factor supporting the dollar-yen but it won’t change the bigger trend.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    China may give Wall Street firms long-sought permission to run their own investment-banking arms on the mainland, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unidentified people briefed on the talks. Officials in Beijing are considering the move amid discussions for a new trade and investment framework with the U.S., the newspaper said. Under existing rules, U.S. firms offer services to companies on the mainland by taking minority stakes in joint ventures with China’s domestic brokerages. Such arrangements have long frustrated some of the world’s biggest banks, which have struggled to challenge local players in China while relinquishing control of key decisions, as well as a share of profits. JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest U.S. bank, said last month it’s in talks to sell a stake in a partnership, JPMorgan First Capital Securities, potentially freeing itself to get more control through a new venture. People briefed on China’s deliberations cautioned that talks are continuing and that details would need to be worked out with regulators, the Wall Street Journal said. An agreement also would need to be ratified by the U.S. Senate, the paper said. Small Share Firms including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS Group AG also established Chinese joint ventures more than a decade ago. But most foreign-backed joint ventures remain minnows in China. JPMorgan First Capital ranked 120th out of China’s 125 securities firms by net income in 2015, according to the Securities Association of China. UBS Securities Co. whose 296 million yuan ($44 million) profit was the biggest among foreign-backed joint ventures, came in at 95th place. JPMorgan’s local partner, First Capital Securities Co., has said it’s held talks to buy the U.S. firm’s stake. The joint venture generated 156 million yuan of revenue in the first half. JPMorgan has weighed options including forming a new joint venture under a framework established in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, people familiar with the matter said last month. That framework opens the door for overseas banks to achieve greater control of local ventures and pick partners that aren’t in the securities business, they said. Even so, the rules have yet to be finalized, the people said.   © Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved. Click Here to comment on this article Close  More ways to share...

The potential fees and reputation boost that could come from working on Uber Technologies Inc.’s initial public offering are the stuff of bankers’ dreams. Yet at least two investment banks passed on selling shares of Uber to their high-net worth clients—shares eventually sold by other banks in January—because the ride-share company wasn’t willing to provide financial details about its business, people with knowledge of the matter said. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank AG both turned down the opportunity to offer their wealthiest clients the option to invest in Uber, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley ended up selling the shares earlier this year through those firms’ private wealth divisions. JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank were concerned they wouldn’t be able to fill demand for the offering given the lack of specifics, the people said. Deutsche Bank also took into consideration that share sales through banks’ private-wealth divisions are unusual, and it hadn’t done one before, one person said. The last such offering of a big technology company was more than four years ago. In that case, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold private shares of Facebook Inc. to international clients before the company went public in 2012. Long game With a company like Uber, the major banks play a long game of relationship building to be best positioned when the company does pick banks to go public. While the Uber share sale was run through the private wealth divisions, it may still help put the firms in the company’s good graces. With the timing of any Uber IPO unclear, banks’ willingness to forgo that business is notable. Before that sale, it seemed like Uber Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick and his management team had most of the leverage. For example, the company told bankers if the firms do any business for its biggest U.S. competitor, Lyft Inc., they’d be less likely to be hired, according to people familiar with those discussions. So far, Kalanick has managed to deflect questions about the timing of the IPO. As recently as last month, he likened Uber to an “early high schooler” being asked to the prom. It’s still a little too soon, he insisted. That reflected some progress from what he’d said a year earlier: “We’re like eighth graders; we’re in junior high, and someone is telling us that we need to go to the prom.” High valuation Uber hasn’t had any trouble raising money since its founding in 2009, because investors typically want in on a highly valued startup before it goes public and the banks want a shot at a role when it does. The San Francisco-based company has garnered more than $16 billion in cash and debt since it started more than six years ago, most recently at a valuation of $69 billion. If it were to go public at that level, it would have a higher valuation than almost 90% of the companies in the S&P 500 Index. JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank passed on the opportunity to do business with Uber just as investor sentiment started to change for market-bound technology companies. There was a backlog of closely held Internet companies, with more than 144 valued at more than $1 billion, research firm CB Insights said in a report. Path to profitability Colin Stewart, a managing director at Morgan Stanley who oversees tech financing at the bank, said at the time that private placements would no longer be the place to find “very strong valuations with a plethora of investors hanging around the hoop.” Underwhelming post-IPO performance by some technology companies, including payments company Square Inc., didn’t help. Investors wanted to see a clear path to profitability. The 290-page prospectus Morgan Stanley sent to prospective investors before the January sale didn’t include Uber’s net income or annual revenue. The document did include 21 pages of risks, namely competition, regulatory hurdles and no assurance that the clients would see any return on their investment. The New York-based bank addressed the lack of data in its prospectus, saying “the development of insights and big ideas is valuable to the investment process, whereas obsession over incremental ‘information’ flow is not.” Uber initially asked Deutsche Bank to be on the offering because it wanted to sell the stock to international investors, one of the people said. Demand for the offering was higher from international clients than domestic, according to two people familiar with the matter. There was demand for more shares than were offered, another person said. Despite passing up on a role in the private offering, JPMorgan advised Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund on its $3.5 billion investment in Uber that was announced in June. A spokesman for Uber declined to comment. Representatives of JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while a representative for Bank of America didn’t respond to a request for comment.

The consensus view is that Clinton does prevail, but analysts are concerned that the final election result may drag beyond Tuesday night in a tight or contested race. And there is always the possibility that the Street gets the election wrong, just as traders did not expect the U.K. to vote to leave the European Union in June. The S&P 500 fell 5 percent after "Brexit" before recovering. The S&P 500 closed at 2,085.18 on Friday, posting a nine-day losing streak for the first time since 1980 as the race between Trump and Clinton appeared to tighten. The index fell about 3 percent over that time. Here's what the major banks are predicting for markets after the election: JPMorgan If Clinton wins, the S&P 500 should recover about 3 percent to 2,150 and European and emerging market stocks should rise 3 to 4 percent, Mislav Matejka and other JPMorgan analysts said in a Monday note. They agreed with the consensus view that a Clinton victory remains more likely than a Trump win. "We believe that if Trump wins, markets are likely to fall further — one should not use the Brexit template where stocks bounced quickly," the note said, referring to the rebound shares made shortly after the United Kingdom voted to leave the EU. Expected effects on specific sectors Source: JPMorgan US Equity Research Goldman Sachs "Our central election expectation continues to be that Sec. Clinton wins the White House, with a slim Democratic majority in the Senate — quite possibly a 50-50 split with the vice president breaking the tie — and a somewhat smaller Republican majority in the House than the 246 seats they currently hold," Goldman economist Alec Phillips said in a Monday note, which did not provide expectations on the market reaction to an election outcome. "With tight polling in several states, it looks quite possible that a final outcome in the presidential race might not become clear until early on November 9," the note said. "The same holds true in the Senate races, where a delayed outcome in one seat could keep either party from winning an outright majority on election night." Barclays The S&P 500 could potentially fall 11 to 13 percent if Trump wins the election, Keith Parker, global equity strategist, said in a Nov. 1 note. If Clinton wins, the index could rise 2 to 3 percent. "We see the U.S. election as first: a risk-off/on event initially that has the greatest effect on equities/rates given the uncertainty," he said. "Second, a macro event that (affects) currencies and to a lesser extent commodities; lastly, a micro event that (affects) a number of industries but one that will play out over time as agendas are implemented." After the Oct. 28 market reaction to news about a new FBI probe into Clinton's emails, Barclays found that health care could underperform by 2 to 3 percent if Clinton wins. Other notable stock reactions that day included weakness in trade-related equities such as railroads, trucking and air freight, particularly railroad Kansas City Southern, which Barclays said has the highest sales to Mexico in the S&P. Citi "The tail risks of a Trump victory or a Democratic 'sweep' could result in a market correction in the 5 percent range (similar to Brexit), after which the investment community reassess the environment," Chief U.S. Equity Strategist Tobias Levkovich said in a Nov. 3 note. Regardless of which candidate wins, Levkovich expects consumer discretionary, energy, financials — especially regional banks — and technology stocks to generally perform well. Materials and real estate should also do well if Trump prevails, according to Levkovich's analysis. US sector recommendations Notes: 1) Multinational trade issues 2) Defense budget trade impact 3) Clinton does not have a real estate background 4) Environmental issues. Source: Citi Research - US Equity Strategy However, more market weakness could arise if no candidate gets the needed 270 electoral college votes or if Clinton wins and Trump does not concede, Levkovich said in the note. The S&P 500 fell more than 5 percent from election day on Nov. 7, 2000, to the Supreme Court decision on Dec. 12 that year deciding a contested vote in George W. Bush's favor. BMO "The worst-case scenario is we don't have decision on Tuesday," said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets. He said a Trump win would likely result in "jittery" markets, and while markets would likely be "happy" with a Clinton victory, questions around the political implications of the election for markets would linger for several months. Note: R: Republican, D: Democrat. Source: BMO Investment Strategy Group.

If Clinton wins, the S&P 500 should move back toward 2,150, and European and emerging market stocks should rise 3 to 4 percent, Mislav Matejka and other JPMorgan analysts said in a Monday note. They agreed with the consensus view that a Clinton victory remains more likely than a Donald Trump win. The S&P 500 closed at 2,085.18 on Friday, posting a nine-day losing streak for the first time since 1980 as the race between Trump and Clinton appeared to tighten. The index fell about 3 percent over that time. US election expected impact, by sector Source: JPMorgan US Equity Research "We believe that if Trump wins, markets are likely to fall further — one should not use the Brexit template where stocks bounced quickly ..." the note said, referring to the rebound shares made shortly after the initial panic that ensued when the United Kingdom voted in June to divorce itself from the European Union. Information technology stocks should perform well if Clinton wins, the JPMorgan analysts said, while health care, energy, financials and consumer discretionary stocks should not do well. A Trump win would likely be positive for banks and consumer discretionary stocks, according to the note.

Wednesday, November 16, 2016 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Berita Sarawak Berita Sabah Berita Nasional Berita Iban Sukan thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Business  Banks, brokers gird for Brexit-style tumult following US election November 9, 2016, Wednesday NEW YORK: Big global banks, including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc are bracing for potential tumult on financial markets after the US election. As the outcome of the most bitterly fought US presidential elections starts to roll out by Wednesday in Asia, the regional markets will the first to trade on the results. As a result, Asia-focused banks HSBC and Japan’s Nomura Holdings Ltd are among institutions boosting staff levels, while others are raising the margin requirements for trading to cope with a possible spike in volume or volatility. Bank preparations ahead of the election reflect their experience following Britain’s shock vote to leave the European Union in June, when the S&P 500 fell 3.6 per cent the day after the poll. In the United States, Morgan Stanley told staff to consider using stop-loss orders, an automated trading mechanism that sells an investor’s position as soon as a stock hits a preset level, if the result causes trading volumes and volatility to spike. The bank also told advisers in its wealth management unit to prepare for election-related conversations with clients and pointed them to relevant pieces of research, according to a Nov 7 memo reviewed by Reuters. Traders expect US stock prices to swing by about 2 per cent in either direction on Wednesday, the day after the election, based on the price of S&P 500 index options. Options on the PowerShares QQQ Trust Russell 2000 ETF, are pricing similarly large swings before the week is out. Some banks are projecting a more extreme drop in the event of a victory for Republican Donald Trump, with Citigroup Inc estimating that a Trump victory could trigger a 3 per cent to 5 per cent sell-off for the S&P 500. US stocks rose on Monday as Democrat Hillary Clinton’s prospects brightened after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would not press criminal charges related to her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Investors have tended to see Clinton as a more status quo candidate, while Trump’s stances on foreign policy, trade and immigration have unnerved the market. The “market pretty much told you who was going to win today,” said one capital markets official at a major bank who was not planning any extraordinary staffing measures. Another official at a rival bank said Monday’s 2.2 per cent rally in US stocks had lowered Wall Street’s collective angst over the election from ‘DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2,’ referring to the US Defense Department’s levels of alert. Brokerage Nomura said in a report on Monday the election was the largest ‘known unknown’ markets have had to contend with since the global financial crisis. It said a Trump victory would likely lead to a more than 6 per cent drop in Asian equities. — Reuters What do you think of this story?

As the outcome of the most bitterly fought U.S. presidential elections starts to roll out by Wednesday in Asia, the regional markets will the first to trade on the results. As a result, Asia-focused banks HSBC and Japan's Nomura Holdings Ltd are among institutions boosting staff levels, while others are raising the margin requirements for trading to cope with a possible spike in volume or volatility. Bank preparations ahead of the election reflect their experience following Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union in June, when the S&P 500 fell 3.6 percent the day after the poll. In the United States, Morgan Stanley told staff to consider using stop-loss orders, an automated trading mechanism that sells an investor's position as soon as a stock hits a preset level, if the result causes trading volumes and volatility to spike. The bank also told advisers in its wealth management unit to prepare for election-related conversations with clients and pointed them to relevant pieces of research, according to a Nov. 7 memo reviewed by Reuters. U.S. brokerage TD Ameritrade is adjusting staff rotas to make as many people as possible available to talk to investors who may be unnerved by any election-related volatility. "When the markets move, it can be difficult to put emotion at bay and stick to your plan," said Kim Hillyer, spokeswoman for TD Ameritrade. TWO PERCENT SWING Traders expect U.S. stock prices to swing by about 2 percent in either direction on Wednesday, the day after the election, based on the price of S&P 500 index options. Options on the PowerShares QQQ Trust Russell 2000 ETF, are pricing similarly large swings before the week is out. Some banks are projecting a more extreme drop in the event of a victory for Republican Donald Trump, with Citigroup Inc estimating that a Trump victory could trigger a 3 percent to 5 percent sell-off for the S&P 500. U.S. stocks rose on Monday as Democrat Hillary Clinton's prospects brightened after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would not press criminal charges related to her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Investors have tended to see Clinton as a more status quo candidate, while Trump's stances on foreign policy, trade and immigration have unnerved the market. The "market pretty much told you who was going to win today," said one capital markets official at a major bank who was not planning any extraordinary staffing measures. Another official at a rival bank said Monday's 2.2 percent rally in U.S. stocks had lowered Wall Street's collective angst over the election to DEFCON 4 from DEFCON 2, referring to the U.S. Defense Department's levels of alert. ASIA IMPACT Brokerage Nomura said in a report on Monday the election was the largest "known unknown" markets have had to contend with since the global financial crisis. It said a Trump victory would likely lead to a more than 6 percent drop in Asian equities. The election could result in both higher trading volumes and higher volatility as it's a bigger event for investors in this region than Brexit, said Stephane Loiseau, head of Societe Generale's Asia Pacific cash equities and global execution services. It plans to increase front office, back office, and technology staff, "ensuring we have a clear escalation system for handling decision-making", and possibly raising risk limits." Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at IG Markets in Melbourne, said his firm had raised margins on U.S. indices and some dollar trades to 1 percent from 0.5 percent, but doesn't expect to see "a massive collapse or spike". HSBC will bolster staff on trading floors in major hubs including London and Hong Kong to deal with client requests, said a person with direct knowledge of the plan. "Around any high profile, potentially market-moving event, it is not unusual for some trading desks to increase staffing levels," said a spokesman for Europe's biggest bank. No U.S. stock exchange plans extraordinary measures to cope with potential market volatility, exchange officials told Reuters on Monday. More than half of the stock and bond fund managers polled by Northern Trust in the third quarter said they expected the election to cause a large increase in market volatility. The extra staffing is similar to what the bank did during Britain's vote to leave the European Union, he said.

While pre-election polls overwhelmingly give Hillary Clinton the advantage ahead of tonight’s result, with Reuters reporting “Clinton has 90 percent chance of winning: Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation“, many banks and brokers – still hurting from the Brexit calamity – aren’t taking chances. Some of the more prominent industry names, such as Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are bracing for potential tumult on financial markets after Tuesday’s U.S. election should Trump win. As the outcome of the most bitterly fought U.S. presidential elections starts to roll out by Wednesday in Asia, the regional markets will be the first to trade on the results. Reuters writes that as a result, Asia-focused banks HSBC and Japan’s Nomura Holdings Ltd are among institutions boosting staff levels, while others are raising the margin requirements for trading to cope with a possible spike in volume or volatility. In the United States, Morgan Stanley told staff to consider using stop-loss orders if the result causes trading volumes and volatility to spike. MS also told advisers in its wealth management unit to prepare for election-related conversations with clients and pointed them to relevant pieces of research. Most banks have already scheduled early Wednesday morning calls to institutional clients to guide them on what next steps will be in either outcome. Meanwhile, traders expect the S&P to swing by about 2% in either direction on Wednesday based on the price of S&P 500 index options. Options on the PowerShares QQQ Trust Russell 2000 ETF, are pricing similarly large swings before the week is out. Some banks are projecting a more extreme drop in the event of a victory for Republican Donald Trump, with Citigroup Inc estimating that a Trump victory could trigger a 3 percent to 5 percent sell-off for the S&P 500. That said, the reaction may be more muted should Hillary be the winner as the vast majority of market participants expect: the “market pretty much told you who was going to win today,” one capital markets official at a major bank who was not planning any extraordinary staffing measures told Reuters. Another official at a rival bank said Monday’s 2.2 percent rally in U.S. stocks had lowered Wall Street’s collective angst over the election from “DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2,” referring to the U.S. Defense Department’s levels of alert. Brokerage Nomura said in a report on Monday the election was the largest “known unknown” markets have had to contend with since the global financial crisis. It said a Trump victory would likely lead to a more than 6% drop in Asian equities. The election could result in both higher trading volumes and higher volatility as it’s a bigger event for investors in this region than Brexit, said Stephane Loiseau, head of Societe Generale’s Asia Pacific cash equities and global execution services. Ironically, both of these are urgently needed by banks to prop up flagging equity trading revenues, as such for many trading desks a Trump victory would be quite welcome. Nomura plans to increase front office, back office, and technology staff, “ensuring we have a clear escalation system for handling decision-making”, and possibly raising risk limits.” Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at IG Markets in Melbourne, said his firm had raised margins on U.S. indices and some dollar trades to 1 percent from 0.5 percent, but doesn’t expect to see “a massive collapse or spike”. In Asia and Europe, HSBC will bolster staff on trading floors in major hubs including London and Hong Kong to deal with client requests, said a person with direct knowledge of the plan. “Around any high profile, potentially market-moving event, it is not unusual for some trading desks to increase staffing levels,” said a spokesman for Europe’s biggest bank. No U.S. stock exchange plans extraordinary measures to cope with potential market volatility, exchange officials told Reuters on Monday. This may change if early voting reflects that a Hillary victory is not a foregone conclusion. * * * Central banks are also prepared for any contingency. The Swiss National Bank stands ready to intervene in the currency markets if the outcome of the U.S. election triggers a rush into the safe haven currency, a member of the central bank’s governing board said on Monday. Andrea Maechler declined to comment on the outcome of the election or how it would affect the Swiss franc or financial markets but said that “the uncertainties are large,” she said in an interview with Swiss TV to be broadcast on Monday evening. “What I can say is just like with the Brexit vote, we are ready. My team is prepared and the Swiss National Bank will be there, if necessary, to intervene to stabilize the currency markets.” We are confident all other central banks are making similar arrangements. * * * Still, while banks are taking measures, few are overly worried that a Brexit outcome will repeat itself. And yet, according to Nomura FX strategists, the USD/JPY is showing an “eerie” parallel with the lead up to the June 23 Brexit vote, after which it plunged to 99.02 on the unexpected result. “Markets appear to price in 90% chance of a Clinton win, so a Trump victory would have a huge market impact that could exceed that of Brexit” says Yunosuke Ikeda, head of FX strategy for Japan at Nomura “The current USD/JPY levels and market situations are coming to resemble those seen before the June U.K. referendum.” * * * But what is the signal that banks will be most focused on to determine if consensus will be wrong – again – and Brexit-like chaos is set for a repeat appearance? According to counterparties, Deutsche Bank – which likewise has a base case that Clinton will win – has advised its sales and trading team to immediately report to their trading desks should Trump wins Pennsylvania and Michigan. This means shortly after the polls in these two states close at 8pm, trading will be either promptly die down or will just be getting started. So should Trump be seen as leading and/or winning in those two key battleground states, expect all volatility hell to break loose. This article is brought to you courtesy of ZeroHedge.

X Banks and brokers prepare for tumult after US election Financial markets likely to react strongly once US election results announced Tue, Nov 8, 2016, 12:11 US stocks rose as Democrat Hillary Clinton’s prospects brightened after the FBI said it would not press criminal charges. Photograph: Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty         Big global banks, including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs are bracing for potential tumult on financial markets after Tuesday’s US election.

As a result, Asia-focused banks HSBC and Japan’s Nomura Holdings Ltd are among institutions boosting staff levels, while others are raising the margin requirements for trading to cope with a possible spike in volume or volatility. Bank preparations ahead of the election reflect their experience following Britain’s shock vote to leave the European Union in June, when the S&P 500 fell 3.6 per cent the day after the poll. In the US, Morgan Stanley told staff to consider using stop-loss orders, an automated trading mechanism that sells an investor’s position as soon as a stock hits a preset level, if the result causes trading volumes and volatility to spike. The bank also told advisers in its wealth management unit to prepare for election-related conversations with clients and pointed them to relevant pieces of research, according to a November 7th memo.

US stocks rose on Monday as Democrat Hillary Clinton's prospects brightened after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would not press criminal charges related to her use of a private e-mail server while secretary of state. Investors have tended to see Clinton as a more status quo candidate, while Trump's stances on foreign policy, trade and immigration have unnerved the market. The “market pretty much told you who was going to win today,” said one capital markets official at a major bank who was not planning any extraordinary staffing measures. Another official at a rival bank said Monday's 2.2 per cent rally in US stocks had lowered Wall Street's collective angst over the election from “DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2,” referring to the US Defense Department's levels of alert. Asia impact Brokerage Nomura said in a report on Monday the election was the largest “known unknown” markets have had to contend with since the global financial crisis. It said a Trump victory would likely lead to a more than 6 per cent drop in Asian equities. The election could result in both higher trading volumes and higher volatility as it's a bigger event for investors in this region than Brexit, said Stephane Loiseau, head of Societe Generale's Asia Pacific cash equities and global execution services. It plans to increase front office, back office, and technology staff, “ensuring we have a clear escalation system for handling decision-making", and possibly raising risk limits.” Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at IG Markets in Melbourne, said his firm had raised margins on US indices and some dollar trades to 1 per cent from 0.5 per cent, but doesn't expect to see “a massive collapse or spike". HSBC will bolster staff on trading floors in major hubs including London and Hong Kong to deal with client requests, said a person with direct knowledge of the plan. “Around any high profile, potentially market-moving event, it is not unusual for some trading desks to increase staffing levels,” said a spokesman for Europe's biggest bank. No US stock exchange plans extraordinary measures to cope with potential market volatility, exchange officials told Reuters on Monday. More than half of the stock and bond fund managers polled by Northern Trust in the third quarter said they expected the election to cause a large increase in market volatility. The extra staffing is similar to what the bank did during Britain's vote to leave the European Union, he said.

Wells Fargo is eligible for up to $1.5 billion in bailout funds over the next seven years. JPMorgan and Bank of America could receive $1.1 billion and $964 million respectively. The continuous flow of funds is a remnant of the $700 billion bailout effort, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP, put in place during the financial crisis. Some of that money, about $28 million, was carved out to help distressed homeowners by paying banks to lower their interest rates and monthly payments. The program, the Home Affordable Modification Program, has undergone several revamps over the last few years and fallen short of helping the 3 million to 4 million homeowners the Obama administration initially hoped. But it continues to operate — HAMP will accept its last homeowner application at the end of this year — and big banks continue to be paid for helping. The stream of cash for the big banks is worrisome to the Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or SIGTARP, the chief watchdog of the financial crisis-era bailouts. Many of the banks have repeatedly broken the rules of the program, including kicking homeowners out unfairly or making it too difficult to apply for the help. “Why are we paying for nonperformance? … At what point is somebody is going to say enough is enough?” said Christy Goldsmith Romero, special inspector general with the Troubled Asset Relief Program, who investigates crime at companies that received taxpayer bailout funds. “If a homeowner doesn’t follow the rules in HAMP, they get knocked out of the program. If a bank doesn’t follow, they still get paid by Treasury.” The banks and the Treasury Department, which oversees HAMP, defend the program. The “error rates” have fallen significantly, Mark McArdle, deputy assistant secretary for financial stability, said in a statement. The SIGTARP report is “inaccurate,” Wells Fargo said in a statement. “We respond quickly to correct any errors we identify or that are brought to our attention.” Bank of America said it has helped more than 2.1 million customers avoid foreclosure through HAMP and other programs. “These initiatives continue to help those who face financial difficulty today, even as the economy has recovered overall,” the bank said in a statement. JPMorgan, which has more than $2 trillion in assets, says most of the money it receives through the program is passed on to investors and homeowners who receive incentives for paying their mortgages on time. The biggest beneficiary of the housing program, by far, is little-known financial company Ocwen. The Atlanta company services millions of mortgages for investors, including collecting payments from homeowners. It has already received $2.9 billion from the HAMP program and over the next seven years, it could receive $2.6 billion more. “We are extremely proud of our performance and our success in helping struggling borrowers remain in their homes,” Ocwen said in a statement.

Bank preparations ahead of the election reflect their experience following Britain’s shock vote to leave the European Union in June, when the S&P 500 fell 3.6 per cent the day after the poll. Morgan Stanley told staff to consider using stop-loss orders, an automated trading mechanism that sells an investor’s position as soon as a stock hits a preset level, if the election result causes trading volumes and volatility to spike. The bank also told advisers in its wealth management unit to prepare for election-related conversations with clients and pointed them to relevant pieces of research, according to a Nov. 7 memo reviewed by Reuters. Traders expect US stock prices to swing by about 2 per cent in either direction tomorrow, the day after the election, based on the price of S&P 500 index options.

Investors have tended to see Clinton as a more status quo candidate, while Trump’s stances on foreign policy, trade and immigration have unnerved the market. The latest twist in the campaign and ensuing stock market rally appears to have quelled a broad push for banks to staff for an all-hands-on-deck event. The “market pretty much told you who was going to win today,” said one capital markets official at a major bank who was not planning any extraordinary staffing measures. Another official at a rival bank said yesterday’s 2.2 per cent rally in US stocks had lowered Wall Street’s collective angst over the election from “DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.” No US stock exchange plans extraordinary measures to cope with potential market volatility, exchange officials told Reuters yesterday. After the election, Morgan Stanley will hold a call for financial advisers and clients with Chief Investment Officer Mike Wilson tomorrow morning. Goldman Sachs is also hosting a call for its private wealth clients led by Chief Investment Officer Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani and members of Washington lobbying groups Elmendorf Ryan and CGCN Group, according to an invitation sent to clients. More than half of the stock and bond fund managers polled by Northern Trust in the third quarter said they expected the election to cause a large increase in market volatility. Tonight, when results begin to come in, JPMorgan will have additional traders on duty in New York to back up its Asian trading teams in case of surges in volume, said bank spokesman Brian Marchiony. The extra staffing is similar to what the bank did during Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, he said. Tomorrow morning, JPMorgan will hold conference calls to discuss the election results and investment implications with customers, including private banking clients, investment managers and institutional clients. A Citigroup spokeswoman described similar plans, including overnight staff in New York on the trading floor. Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co are also hosting calls for members of their wealth management divisions. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Nepal PM phones India’s Modi over rupee chaos Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites European equities drift higher United to delay taking Boeing jets in US$4.8b savings push Snapchat files for one of the biggest tech IPOs in years, sources say Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter Most Watched Now Week An in-depth look at Mazda’s SKYACTIV-G engine Reuters Video: Groin-flashing frog discovered in Australia Reuters Video: Supermoon dazzles in Havana Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Related Articles Lies in the guise of news in the Trump era — Nicholas Kristof UN chief confident Trump will drop rhetoric, show leadership Trump names loyalists, children to transition team (VIDEO) Donald Trump wins White House in stunning upset Shock and angst in Asia as Trump rises Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo prev next prev next Thumbnail Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: Big global banks, including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc are bracing for potential tumult on financial markets after Tuesday's U.S. election. As the outcome of the most bitterly fought U.S. presidential elections starts to roll out by Wednesday in Asia, the regional markets will be the first to trade on the results. As a result, Asia-focused banks HSBC and Japan's Nomura Holdings Ltd are among institutions boosting staff levels, while others are raising the margin requirements for trading to cope with a possible spike in volume or volatility. Bank preparations ahead of the election reflect their experience following Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union in June, when the S&P 500 fell 3.6 percent the day after the poll. In the United States, Morgan Stanley told staff to consider using stop-loss orders, an automated trading mechanism that sells an investor's position as soon as a stock hits a preset level, if the result causes trading volumes and volatility to spike. The bank also told advisers in its wealth management unit to prepare for election-related conversations with clients and pointed them to relevant pieces of research, according to a Nov. 7 memo reviewed by Reuters. 2 PERCENT SWING Traders expect U.S. stock prices to swing by about 2 percent in either direction on Wednesday, the day after the election, based on the price of S&P 500 index options. Options on the PowerShares QQQ Trust Russell 2000 ETF, are pricing similarly large swings before the week is out. Some banks are projecting a more extreme drop in the event of a victory for Republican Donald Trump, with Citigroup Inc estimating that a Trump victory could trigger a 3 percent to 5 percent sell-off for the S&P 500. U.S. stocks rose on Monday as Democrat Hillary Clinton’s prospects brightened after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would not press criminal charges related to her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Investors have tended to see Clinton as a more status quo candidate, while Trump's stances on foreign policy, trade and immigration have unnerved the market.

Another official at a rival bank said Monday's 2.2 percent rally in U.S. stocks had lowered Wall Street's collective angst over the election from "DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2," referring to the U.S. Defense Department's levels of alert. ASIA IMPACT Brokerage Nomura said in a report on Monday the election was the largest "known unknown" markets have had to contend with since the global financial crisis. It said a Trump victory would likely lead to a more than 6 percent drop in Asian equities. The election could result in both higher trading volumes and higher volatility as it's a bigger event for investors in this region than Brexit, said Stephane Loiseau, head of Societe Generale's Asia Pacific cash equities and global execution services.

Options on the PowerShares QQQ Trust Russell 2000 ETF, are pricing similarly large swings before the week is out. Some banks are projecting a more extreme drop in the event of a victory for Republican Donald Trump, with Citigroup Inc estimating that a Trump victory could trigger a 3 percent to 5 percent selloff for the S&P 500. US stocks rose on Monday as Democrat Hillary Clinton’s prospects brightened after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would not press criminal charges related to her use of a private email server. Investors have tended to see Clinton as a more status quo candidate, while Trump’s stances on foreign policy, trade and immigration have unnerved the market. After the election, Morgan Stanley will hold a call for financial advisers and clients with Chief Investment Officer Mike Wilson on Wednesday morning. Goldman Sachs is also hosting a call for its private wealth clients led by Chief Investment Officer Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani and members of Washington lobbying groups Elmendorf Ryan and CGCN Group, according to an invitation sent to clients. More than half of the stock and bond fund managers polled by Northern Trust in the third quarter said they expected the election to cause a large increase in market volatility. On Tuesday night, when results begin to come in, JPMorgan will have additional traders on duty in New York to back up its Asian trading teams in case of surges in volume, said bank spokesman Brian Marchiony. The extra staffing is similar to what the bank did during Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, he said. On Wednesday morning, JPMorgan will hold conference calls to discuss the election results and investment implications with customers, including private banking clients, investment managers and institutional clients. A Citigroup spokeswoman described similar plans, including overnight staff in New York on the trading floor. Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co are also hosting calls for members of their wealth management divisions.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:30 AM, November 8, 2016 Updated: 12:00 AM, November 9, 2016 Big global banks, including Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc are bracing for potential tumult on financial markets after Tuesday's U.S. election. As the outcome of the most bitterly fought U.S. presidential elections starts to roll out by Wednesday in Asia, the regional markets will be the first to trade on the results. As a result, Asia-focused banks HSBC and Japan's Nomura Holdings Ltd are among institutions boosting staff levels, while others are raising the margin requirements for trading to cope with a possible spike in volume or volatility. Bank preparations ahead of the election reflect their experience following Britain's shock vote to leave the European Union in June, when the S&P 500 fell 3.6 percent the day after the poll. In the United States, Morgan Stanley told staff to consider using stop-loss orders, an automated trading mechanism that sells an investor's position as soon as a stock hits a preset level, if the result causes trading volumes and volatility to spike. The bank also told advisers in its wealth management unit to prepare for election-related conversations with clients and pointed them to relevant pieces of research, according to a Nov. 7 memo reviewed by Reuters. 2 PERCENT SWING Traders expect U.S. stock prices to swing by about 2 percent in either direction on Wednesday, the day after the election, based on the price of S&P 500 index options. Options on the PowerShares QQQ Trust Russell 2000 ETF, are pricing similarly large swings before the week is out. Some banks are projecting a more extreme drop in the event of a victory for Republican Donald Trump, with Citigroup Inc estimating that a Trump victory could trigger a 3 percent to 5 percent sell-off for the S&P 500. U.S. stocks rose on Monday as Democrat Hillary Clinton’s prospects brightened after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it would not press criminal charges related to her use of a private email server while secretary of state. Investors have tended to see Clinton as a more status quo candidate, while Trump's stances on foreign policy, trade and immigration have unnerved the market. The "market pretty much told you who was going to win today," said one capital markets official at a major bank who was not planning any extraordinary staffing measures. Another official at a rival bank said Monday's 2.2 percent rally in U.S. stocks had lowered Wall Street's collective angst over the election to DEFCON 4 from DEFCON 2, referring to the U.S. Defense Department's levels of alert. ASIA IMPACT Brokerage Nomura said in a report on Monday the election was the largest "known unknown" markets have had to contend with since the global financial crisis. It said a Trump victory would likely lead to a more than 6 percent drop in Asian equities. The election could result in both higher trading volumes and higher volatility as it's a bigger event for investors in this region than Brexit, said Stephane Loiseau, head of Societe Generale's Asia Pacific cash equities and global execution services. It plans to increase front office, back office, and technology staff, "ensuring we have a clear escalation system for handling decision-making", and possibly raising risk limits." Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at IG Markets in Melbourne, said his firm had raised margins on U.S. indices and some dollar trades to 1 percent from 0.5 percent, but doesn't expect to see "a massive collapse or spike". HSBC will bolster staff on trading floors in major hubs including London and Hong Kong to deal with client requests, said a person with direct knowledge of the plan. "Around any high profile, potentially market-moving event, it is not unusual for some trading desks to increase staffing levels," said a spokesman for Europe's biggest bank. No U.S. stock exchange plans extraordinary measures to cope with potential market volatility, exchange officials told Reuters on Monday. More than half of the stock and bond fund managers polled by Northern Trust in the third quarter said they expected the election to cause a large increase in market volatility. The extra staffing is similar to what the bank did during Britain's vote to leave the European Union, he said.

(AMZN) Stock Can Make You Money, Even When It’s Overpriced AMZN stock's valuation is always in doubt, but you can make still money By Nicolas Chahine, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Nov 7, 2016, 12:25 pm EST     Popular Posts: Alphabet Inc (GOOG, GOOGL) Stock Can Earn You Free Money Get Paid to Catch the Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Knife 2 Gold Stocks to Profit From for Cheap (JNUG GDX) Recent Posts: Get Paid to Catch the Facebook Inc (FB) Stock Knife Fill Your Cup With Starbucks Corporation (SBUX) Stock 2 Gold Stocks to Profit From for Cheap (JNUG GDX) View All Posts Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) rewrote the book on how to grow a company’s top line. Under Jeff Bezos, AMZN stock managed to enter and dominate dozens of high profile industries … one of which was what we’ve come to know as ‘the cloud.’ Source: Atomic Taco Via Flickr As accomplished as this company has been, I still see stubborn experts trying to short AMZN stock for fundamental reasons. Sure, I’ve occasionally had short AMZN positions, but they were always part of a range trade. I have shared trades that generated profits out of thin air by selling iron condors into AMZN. Here is a November trade that generated over $3 per contract of pure profit. This was 20% yield on money risked in just three months. AMZN Stock Chart I agree that on paper, AMZN stock looks extended. But for a company that has so far grown perpetually, the traditional valuation measuring sticks are not as useful. Click to Enlarge Technically, one could have made an argument that $700 per share was in the cards since 2007. Today I want to rinse and repeat. AMZN stock reported a decent quarter, yet markets sold it down $100 on general political fears. This is usually an opportunity to sell some bullish risk below market levels. 7 A-Rated Cheap Stocks to Buy for Rapid-Fire Growth Meaning I sell bullish put spreads with a healthy buffer below. Amazon Stock Trade Ideas Trade No. 1 — The Bet: Sell AMZN Dec $710/$705 credit put spread. This is a bullish trade for which I collect 50 cents per contract to open. By selling it, I have an 85% theoretical chance of yielding 10% on money at risk. When selling spreads, I like to leave room for error. In this case I only have a 6% buffer from current price. Usually I like a bigger buffer, but AMZN has recently fallen about $100 from its highs. To mitigate risk I often like to balance my bet. To do that I can set a similar but opposing trade. Trade No. 2 — The Hedge (Optional): Sell AMZN Dec $845/$850 credit call spread. This is a bearish trade for which I collect 41 cents per contract to open. This trade has a buffer of 10% from current price. This would theoretically translate into an 85% chance of success to yield an additional 8% on money risked. Click to Enlarge Taking both trades, I would have sold an iron condor, which is a range-bound trade, meaning I need AMZN stock price to stay between both trades to earn maximum profits. This setup is much tighter than my usual preference. But since I already have had several wins under my belt from Amazon, I am going a bit more aggressive with this thread-the-needle trade. I do have to recognize that short term, AMZN stock needs a bounce or risks inviting more technical sellers. This would likely be decided by the outcome of the Elections. After 15 Years, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is Cool Again The AMZN bounce would require a clear win for Clinton. If we get a contested outcome, then the uncertainty would linger thereby placing more downside pressure on equity markets in general. I am not required to hold these AMZN trades through expiration. I can close either for partial gains or losses at any time. Nicolas Chahine is the managing director of SellSpreads.com.

(AP Photo/LM Otero, File) The Associated Press NEW YORK • Eight years after taxpayers rescued the U.S. financial system, some of the country's largest banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, continue to receive billions in bailout money, according to government data. Wells Fargo is eligible for up to $1.5 billion in bailout funds over the next seven years. JPMorgan and Bank of America could receive $1.1 billion and $964 million respectively. The continuous flow of funds is a remnant of the $700 billion bailout effort, known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP, signed into law by President George W. Bush in October 2008, during the financial crisis. Some of that money, about $28 billion, was carved out to help distressed homeowners by paying banks to lower their interest rates and monthly payments. The program, the Home Affordable Modification Program, has undergone several revamps over the last few years and fallen short of helping the 3 million to 4 million homeowners the administration of President Barack Obama initially hoped. But it continues to operate — HAMP will accept its last homeowner application at the end of this year — and big banks continue to be paid for helping. The stream of cash for the big banks is worrisome to Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or SIGTARP, the chief watchdog of the financial crisis-era bailouts. Many of the banks have repeatedly broken the rules of the program, including kicking homeowners out unfairly or making it too difficult to apply for the help. "Why are we paying for nonperformance? ... At what point is somebody is going to say enough and is enough?" said Christy Goldsmith Romero, special inspector general with the Troubled Asset Relief Program, who investigates crime at companies that received taxpayer bailout funds. "If a homeowner doesn't follow the rules in HAMP they get knocked out of the program. If a bank doesn't follow they still get paid by Treasury." The banks and the Treasury Department, which oversees HAMP, defend the program. The "error rates" have fallen significantly, Mark McArdle, deputy assistant secretary for financial stability, said in a statement. The SIGTARP report is "inaccurate," Wells Fargo said in a statement. "We respond quickly to correct any errors we identify or that are brought to our attention." Bank of America said it has helped more than 2.1 million customers avoid foreclosure through HAMP and other programs. "These initiatives continue to help those who face financial difficulty today, even as the economy has recovered overall," the bank said in a statement.

The biggest beneficiary of the housing program, by far, is little-known financial company Ocwen. The Atlanta company services millions of mortgages for investors, including collecting payments from homeowners. It has already received $2.9 billion from the HAMP program and over the next seven years, it could receive $2.6 billion more. "We are extremely proud of our performance and our success in helping struggling borrowers remain in their homes," Ocwen said in a statement.

That was the finding reached by S. Katherine Roy, chief retirement strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. She hosted a presentation on the topic at the recent Schwab IMPACT conference in San Diego. Parents can create the bandwidth to fund college tuition and retirement if they begin saving as early as possible. Grandparents can help them get there with well-timed tax-free gifts, too. "The good news is that if you do everything right, funding public school tuition is doable, and you can keep your retirement on track," said Roy. Early sacrifices In collaboration with Michael Conrath, a 529 program director at JPMorgan, Roy put together a case study to tackle the question of whether it's possible to save for retirement and college. The cost of education would be highest for those with younger children. If a couple today has a newborn, it will cost $455,585 to send him or her to a four-year private institution, according to JPMorgan's projections. The cost of a public institution, on the other hand, will be $202,768. The case study tracks a hypothetical married couple, the Lees. They are 28-years-old with a newborn, and they'd like to have a second child in two years. The two have been working since age 22, earning total income of $60,000, and their salaries are growing at a rate that varies by age, based on JPMorgan's analysis of individual wage data from the Social Security Administration. The Lees have also been contributing to their 401(k)s since they've started their careers, earning an average annual rate of return of 6.5 percent. Finally, the couple has been saving for college since the birth of their first child, earning a return of 6 percent per year. The magic number The couple can accumulate $6.5 million by age 65 if they begin saving 15 percent of their salaries in their 401(k)s at age 22, according to JPMorgan's research. That deferral rate includes the Lees' 12 percent contribution, plus a 3 percent company match. When the first child arrives, the couple, who will be 28 years old, can dial back their retirement plan savings rate to 12.2 percent and begin investing the difference — the equivalent of 2.8 percent of salary — into a 529 college savings plan. After they have their second child at age 30, the couple continues saving to their 401(k), this time at a rate of 9.4 percent. The difference, which is equal to 5.6 percent of salary, continues to go toward the college savings plan. Once the first child starts college and the Lees turn 46, they can ratchet up their retirement plan savings to 12.2 percent and continue to fund the college plan. After their youngest begins his or her higher education, the parents can revert to their original 15 percent deferral rate into their retirement plans. They will maintain that level of savings until they retire at age 65. Help from Grandma Everyone wins if the grandparents decide to pitch in, according to JPMorgan's research. You can make a lump sum contribution of up to $70,000 —$140,000 if you're married and filing jointly — to a 529 if you spread the gift out over five years. Per the case study, if the grandparents make a $140,000 gift to the college savings account after the birth of the first child, the Lees can continue deferring 15 percent of their salaries into their retirement plans. By the time they reach retirement at age 65, they'll have $7.8 million in their 401(k)s. Meanwhile, the grandparents have the added benefit of funding the kids' college expenses and moving the gifted assets out of their estate. "Gifting to others is something we've started to do more," said Roy. "Contribute to the 529 and take advantage of the estate planning benefit." Reaching for private school Roy admitted that even with a solid savings plan, fully funding four years at a private college for two kids is a stretch. Past guidelines have called for parents to use up to a third of their earnings to pay for college, she said. "It's difficult to cover a third of the cost from current income; [the family] will be eating cat food," Roy said. A combination of saving early in a 529 plan, plus gifts from grandparents, can help families reach for private school. A child can also take out a small student loan to help cover the costs. "What if they take out one semester's worth of loans?" said Roy. "Some studies suggest that it's not bad for kids to have some skin in the game and it makes them commit to the process."

The 2016 campaign — by far the worst and most depressing in MM’s lifetime — finally comes to a merciful close. Hillary Clinton maintains a slim national polling lead (1.8 percent in RCP). And she is ahead in enough states to produce 297 electoral votes and win the White House. She could add to that total with potential wins in Ohio, Nevada, North Carolina and New Hampshire. Donald Trump’s path requires flipping Florida and taking at least one of Clinton’s “blue wall” Midwestern states. The early vote in Florida does not bode well for Trump, especially a huge spike in Latino voters. The Trump campaign apparently thinks it can win Michigan, though public polling continues to show Clinton with a nearly 5-point lead in the state. And the Clinton campaign got a burst of good news Sunday afternoon when FBI Director James Comey informed Congress that a review of recently discovered emails would not change their decision not to pursue a case against Clinton. Trump could certainly still win. But it would require a much bigger swing-state turnout among less-educated white voters than most models expect.

MARKETS RALLY ON FBI NEWS — Reuters’ David Henry and Rodrigo Campos: “U.S. equity index futures rallied at the open on Sunday as bullish sentiment returned to Wall Street following the largest streak of losses on the S&P 500 since 1980. “The news from the FBI and recent reports of Clinton starting to regain strength in public opinion polls likely explain the move higher in stock futures and in the Mexican currency, said Michael Yoshikami, chief executive of investment management firm Destination Wealth Management of Walnut Creek, California.” Read more. TRUMP WIN COULD TANK DOLLAR — Bloomberg’s Andrea Wong and Anooja Debnath: “The dollar will plunge toward the weakest since 2013 against the yen in the wake of an election victory for … Trump, the most-accurate currency forecasters say. Within 24 hours, the greenback will drop to 100 yen or lower if Trump is voted president, according to the majority of the top 10 foreign-exchange analysts in Bloomberg’s third-quarter rankings. “If Hillary Clinton wins, they see an advance. The dollar surged 0.8 percent to 103.97 yen as of 7:26 a.m. in Tokyo on Monday after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it maintains the view Clinton’s handling of her e-mails wasn’t a crime The survey of leading currency analysts shows that even the biggest and most liquid global markets face sharp swings and volatility in the aftermath of Tuesday’s vote, with repercussions set to spread around the world” Read more. ASIA RISES — Asian stocks bounced and the dollar strengthened on Monday after the FBI said it stood by its earlier recommendation that no criminal charges were warranted … Clinton. The news lifted a cloud over Clinton's presidential campaign … and boosted S&P 500 Index futures by 1.2 percent, a gain that is likely to snap a nine-day losing streak in the U.S. stock index - its longest in more than 35 years. But volumes were thin, indicating many investors had already taken to the sidelines ahead of the vote. Read more. INVESTORS LESS WORRIED ABOUT DEM WAVE — Via Goldman’s Weekly Kickstart email: “Two weeks ago, investors voiced concern about the possibility of a Democratic ‘wave election,’ which would make policy changes more likely, and expressed hope the race would tighten. Having tightened, however, the race has lifted equity uncertainty and implied volatility. Despite the S&P 500 realizing volatility during October of just 7, the VIX index of implied volatility jumped to 22 this week. “Our volatility strategist Buzz Gregory notes that the spread between implied and realized volatility ranks in the 99th percentile since 1990, suggesting a potential swift VIX collapse if uncertainty declines post-election. However, a surprise election outcome could cause both realized and implied volatility to rise even further.” WALL STREET BUYS ITS OWN POLLS — Business Insider’s Rachael Levy: “Unwilling to rely on public polls conducted mostly by the media and universities … hedge funds and other large investors are paying for their own poll data and analysis. And they're paying a lot more than any news outlet or school would pay for more precise data that isn't always publicly available. “The point is to get a higher-quality, more accurate read on possible outcomes than a cash-strapped paper might be able to, or to ask specific questions that public pollsters may not be thinking of, says Scott Tranter, cofounder of Øptimus, a DC-based data firm. … For investors, there's money to be made even just by knowing that Clinton's lead isn't as fragile as the latest polls indicate, which could [impact] markets.” Read more. MEET TOM NIDES — Alec MacGillis writes on the Hillary Clinton and Wall Street in the new issue of the New Yorker with a focus on Morgan Stanley’s Tom Nides, “widely admired for his commitment and his judgment, as well as for his humor and his personal warmth. But he has also been involved in some of the major episodes that pulled the Democrats closer to big business and to Wall Street” Read more. COMEY TO CONGRESS: NEVER MIND — POLITICO’s Gabriel Debenedetti: “Another day, another bombshell. The ever-turbulent presidential race took another dramatic turn on Sunday afternoon as … Comey revealed in a letter to Congress that newly-discovered messages would not affect his bureau’s decision that … Clinton did not deserve prosecution — a revelation that comes a little more than a week after Comey first set the race into a frenzy” Read more. SENATE FORECAST: DEMS NARROWLY FAVORED — POLITICO’s Burgess Everett and Rachael Bade: “Democrats look like slightly-better-than-even favorites to reclaim the Senate, while Republicans appear certain to hold the House … If Democrats manage to flip the Senate, senior party aides and strategists involved in battleground races said they’re looking at a majority of 52 seats, best case. That would be a letdown from their earlier hopes of a 54- or 55-seat advantage, and put Republicans in the pole position to win back the chamber in 2018” Read more. PENCE: TRUMP WILL CONCEDE IF RESULT IS CLEAR — GOP VP nominee Mike Pence on “Fox News Sunday”: “The campaign’s made it very clear — a clear outcome, obviously both sides will accept … I think both campaigns have also been very clear that in the event of disputed results, they reserve all legal rights and remedies” Read more. CLINTON CAMP ON DODD-FRANK — In the latest Wikileaks email dump, here’s the Clinton campaign’s Josh Schwerin in a note to senior advisers Jake Sullivan and John Podesta: “John, I talked to Barney Frank today and he forcefully suggested that HRC should speak out about the on-going attacks against financial reform in the new Congress. He also said that if she did, he would make sure Warren and others on the left applauded. Earlier we avoided getting involved in the Cromnibus fight in part because it would have meant getting crosswise with the WH, but that no longer feels like an issue” Read more.

In the best news for Clinton and the Democrats, wages for American workers are now rising at the fastest pace in seven years. … Stagnant wages have plagued the economy since the latest recovery began seven years ago, helping drive voter anxiety and aiding the rise of Trump’s brand of aggressive, nationalist populism. That story is now changing. ‘This is clearly a boost to the Clinton campaign.

CHINA OPENS UP TO WALL STREET — WSJ’s Julie Steinberg: “Beijing is considering allowing Wall Street banks to run their own investment-banking businesses on the mainland … a significant step that would give them more access to Chinese domestic markets that have been hard to crack. “The long-awaited move, which is being discussed as part of a new U.S.-China trade and investment framework, would mean companies like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. could conduct investment-banking business in China on their own, such as underwriting initial public offerings on domestic exchanges. Currently, foreign financial firms operating on the mainland must pair up with domestic brokerages in joint ventures in which they hold minority stakes, split profits and have a limited scope of business” Read more. LIBERALS PUSH STEIN AT SEC — POLITICO Pro’s Patrick Temple-West: “Stein, who has sometimes clashed with White in pushing for tougher penalties on misbehaving companies and for greater investor protection, is being promoted by liberals who have voiced disappointment in the current SEC chair.” “Stein pressed for a stronger “Volcker rule,” the section of Dodd-Frank that banned banks from proprietary trading. She also hammered her fellow commissioners for voting to give financial firms permission to continue doing certain business operations after the companies agreed to misconduct settlements with the agency.” Read more. BRUSSELS PLAYS HARDBALL — FT’s Alex Barker and Jim Brunsden: “Brussels is reconsidering how it grants EU market access to overseas financial firms, casting doubt over the use of the bloc’s “equivalence” arrangements as a fallback option for the City of London after Brexit. “Any move to tighten the access regime would signal that Brussels will let Britain take nothing for granted in negotiations to leave the EU. It would also be a blow to the US and more than a dozen jurisdictions, who fear approval for their pending applications will be waylaid by Brexit politics.” Read more. SODA WARS — POLITICO’s Helena Bottemiller Evich: “Residents in San Francisco, Oakland and Albany, Calif., are voting Tuesday on a referendum that would impose penny-per-ounce taxes on sugary drinks from Coca-Cola to Gatorade in what has become the most expensive city-level ballot fight ever waged in the United States. “Using the same media firm that ran the Brexit campaign, the powerful American Beverage Association has spent nearly $30 million to oppose the taxes. Proponents, meanwhile, have poured nearly $20 million into the effort, with most of it coming from Bloomberg, whose unsuccessful effort to ban super-sized sodas while mayor of New York City was pilloried.”Read more. SAMSUNG’S COMEBACK BID — Bloomberg’s Jungah Lee: “Samsung Electronics Co. plans to equip its next Galaxy S smartphones with a Siri-like digital assistant, seeking to make a comeback after the global debacle that precipitated the death of its flawed Note 7 lineup. “Samsung, which last month acquired U.S.-based artificial-intelligence software company Viv Labs Inc., said the Galaxy S8 slated for next year will come with AI-enabled features “significantly differentiated” from those of Apple Inc.’s Siri or Google, executive vice president Rhee In-jong told reporters.

BAIDU DOES DELIVERY — Bloomberg News’: “Baidu Inc. is seeking to raise as much as $500 million for its Waimai food delivery unit amid a costly battle with other Chinese internet giants for customers, according to people familiar with the matter. “Using scooters to supply everything from Starbucks coffee to sliced sashimi, Waimai is in a pitched battle with rivals to sign up delivery men and convince restaurants to join its service.

A TALE OF TWO COMPANIES — NYT’s Nick Wingfield and Kate Benner “Today, Microsoft and Salesforce are archrivals that recently battled each other to buy the social network LinkedIn — hungry for its troves of highly personalized data about businesspeople.

The data stashed in their servers has elevated services like these from an amusing distraction to an essential tool that helps big businesses understand their customers.” Read more.

They also assert that he had his wife Chelsea Clinton make calls to set up meetings with potential investors who support her family’s political and charitable endeavors” Read more. ** A message from the Insured Retirement Institute: As traditional pensions have disappeared, American workers have become more responsible for saving and preparing for their retirements.

Home Mail Search News Cricket Movies Lifestyle Celebrity Flickr Mobile Answers More Yahoo Search Search Mail News Home Follow us National World US Elections Finance Cricket Lifestyle Sports Good News Videos Autos Tesco says $3 million stolen in cyber theft, resumes service By Lawrence White and Tom Bergin8 November 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Share By Lawrence White and Tom Bergin LONDON (Reuters) - Retailer Tesco Plc's banking arm said on Tuesday that 2.5 million pounds ($3 million) had been stolen from 9,000 customers over the weekend in what cyber experts said was the first mass hacking of accounts at a western bank. Tesco Bank said it had resumed full service after the theft, which forced the suspension of online transactions on Monday. “We’ve now refunded all customer accounts affected by fraud and lifted the suspension of online debit transactions so that customers can use their accounts as normal," Tesco Bank CEO Benny Higgins said in a statement. The bank, whose operating income has accounted for as much as a quarter of Tesco's total in some years, added that no customer data had been compromised. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), a new government body, said on Tuesday that it was working with criminal investigators and Tesco to understand the nature of an attack described as "unprecedented" by the financial regulator. The NCSC and Britain's National Crime Agency said they could not remember another confirmed case where thieves had stolen large sums of money via a mass hacking of accounts at a Western bank. The bank has provided few details about what happened. It is not clear how online thieves broke into the bank, how they pulled out the funds or how much was stolen. It is also not clear if there are any suspects. A spokeswoman for Tesco declined to comment beyond its previous statement on Monday. SMALLER BANKS AT RISK Cyber experts said that smaller banks, like Tesco's, are more vulnerable to attack than global financial institutions, which have bigger cyber security budgets. JPMorgan , for example, has disclosed that it spends about $600 million on cyber security annually. "Smaller and medium-sized companies may be more vulnerable, many of them have not invested properly in security measures and an incident like this should stimulate them to think again," said Sergio Romanets, cyber security expert at consultant Greyspark Partners in London. Cyber and IT security risks have received little coverage in Tesco Bank's most recent annual report, according to a Reuters analysis, with just one mention - saying "of note is the industry-wide attention on cyber-crime". Rival J Sainsbury Plc's bank unit and Metro Bank Plc , two other smaller "challenger" banks in Britain, each mention cyber and information security at least three times in their most recent annual reports. By contrast, among the country's biggest banks, Santander UK has at least 49 mentions, Barclays at least 14 and Lloyds 32. Tesco Bank runs on separate IT systems from the group's retail unit. The lender was originally set up as a joint venture with Royal Bank of Scotland and Tesco Plc in 1997 before becoming wholly owned by the retailer in 2008. U.S. financial technology provider Fiserv provides its online retail banking platform and its financial crime prevention system, according to Fiserv's website. "There is no indication that our software or services were involved in the incident that Tesco Bank experienced over the weekend. Nonetheless, we are offering our support in whatever manner will be helpful to Tesco Bank," a spokeswoman for Fiserv said in an emailed statement to Reuters. Tesco Bank has spent 500 million pounds ($618.75 million)building up its technology platform over the past seven years since the split with RBS, accounts show. Britain's financial regulator sought to reassure the public on Tuesday that financial authorities were working to understand the nature of the attack. On Monday, lawmaker Andrew Tyrie, chair of Parliament's powerful finance committee, said both banks and regulators had done too little to improve cyber security. Reported attacks on financial institutions in Britain have risen from just five in 2014 to more than 75 so far this year, according to Financial Conduct Authority data, but bank executives and providers of security systems say many attacks go unreported.

In short, it was a desperate effort to bail out Wall Street — and by extension homeowners — by allocating nearly three quarters of a trillion dollars. It was also marketed to bailout-leery Americans as a short-term fix to a crumbling economy. But not only has TARP underperformed, the program has been anything but temporary. A Washington Post report says that taxpayers, nearly a decade later, are still doling out gobs of money through an offshoot program called the Home Affordable Modification Program. Just how much are we talking about? Additional distribution could come to $1.5 billion for Wells Fargo, $1.1 billion for JPMorgan and $964 million for Bank of America. Other banks will receive more funds as well. According to the Post, “The continuous flow of funds is a remnant of the $700 billion bailout effort … put in place during the financial crisis. Some of that money, about $28 billion, was carved out to help distressed homeowners by paying banks to lower their interest rates and monthly payments.” The Post continues, “The program, the Home Affordable Modification Program, has undergone several revamps over the last few years and fallen short of helping the 3 million to 4 million homeowners the Obama administration initially hoped. … [T]he stream of cash for the big banks is worrisome to Office of the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or SIGTARP, the chief watchdog of the financial crisis-era bailouts. Many of the banks have repeatedly broken the rules of the program, including kicking homeowners out unfairly or making it too difficult to apply for the help.” TARP is a topic that elicits differences of opinion, even among fiscal conservatives. But regardless of whether the goal was pure and worth the risk, the bottom line is that bailouts inevitably leave taxpayers in a perennial quagmire. It was government policies under the Bill Clinton administration that laid the foundation for the 2008 financial collapse. Today, the government is coming full circle by re-introducing those same failed policies. For those who rail against “greedy” Wall Street, perhaps some re-evaluation is in order. Taxpayers, after all, shouldn’t be the scapegoat for government meddling.

Finance Search Wed, Nov 16, 2016, 12:11 PM AEDT - Australia Markets close in 3 hrs 49 mins Wall Street voting for Clinton and Republican CongressBy Luc Lacroix | AFP – Tue, Nov 8, 2016 7:39 PM AEDT Recommend 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Related Content View Photo A surprise win by Trump, who has consistently trailed in the polls, could spur a sharp negative reaction in stock markets After an unpredictable and bitter campaign season, Wall Street is eyeing its preferred 2016 election outcome: a Hillary Clinton presidency offset by a Republican-controlled Congress. Evidence of the market's clear inclination for a Clinton victory has been seen at key junctures in the race, such as when stock futures surged in the moments after the first presidential debate, which was widely seen as a win for the former secretary of state. "The S&P 500 futures exploded higher," recalled Gregori Volokhine, president of Meeschaert Capital Markets. "It was obvious which candidate the market prefers." That preference also was on display in response to news about Clinton's email investigation, including Sunday, when stock futures spiked higher after the FBI cleared the Democratic candidate in the latest review of emails linked to her private server. Analysts view Clinton as a known quantity who is likely to maintain many of the policies of President Barack Obama. In contrast, Republican Donald Trump is viewed as a wildcard with no public service record and a penchant for lambasting everything from free trade deals to the Federal Reserve to people who contradict him. A surprise win by Trump, who has consistently trailed in the polls, could spur a sharp negative reaction Wednesday, although markets could steady after that. "The big move would be caused just by the unknown of what he might do and the perception that he's volatile," said Michael Scanlon, managing director of Manulife Asset Management. "Then the reason I temper that and say it would be short-lived is that we still have a government with checks and balances. It's not like he's being elected king or anything like that." - Market likes gridlock - While the market has shown it favors Clinton in the White House, that does not extend to Democrats in Congress. When Clinton appeared to pull away significantly from Trump in polls last month, some analysts expressed worry that a Democratic congressional sweep could lead to efforts to tax business more heavily, or take other steps viewed as anti-growth. The market is accustomed to having a Democratic president offset by a Republican Congress and views a change to that equilibrium as a potential threat. On Monday, "the market rallied on the assumption that the GOP should manage to retain control of one house, if not both houses, of Congress, thereby ensuring an environment of continued political gridlock," said Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare. "It's a view we suspect that doesn't register quite as neatly on Main Street, where millions and millions of votes will be cast today on the basis of wanting to see some meaningful changes." As far as election evening trading, several leading banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Credit Suisse, plan to provide US staff overnight in expectation that volume will be elevated. "JPMorgan will have some traders staffed on the New York trading desks during the night hours, ready to support our Asia trading teams manage any potential spikes in volume," a spokesman said. "That is similar to what we did for the Brexit vote." Although US stock markets will be closed when the election results begin to come in, there are many other available avenues to trade, including the foreign exchange market and the S&P 500 futures market. Trading volume likely will rise in spurts as key results are announced, such as critical swing states in the presidential contest, including Florida, North Carolina and Ohio. "Looking at the last election, it seems fair to say that the result comes around midnight," said Erik Nelson, a foreign exchange analyst at Wells Fargo. "I would say around midnight we would get the most volatility as we get a little more sense of what is going on." JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist of TD Ameritrade, will be monitoring multiple television screens and tracking political blogs. "I'll be doing what every other loser trader does, sitting in front of my screen and trying to trade futures," he said. "There is going to be opportunity." @y7finance on Twitter, become a fan on Facebook Top Stories » Macdonald quits Big W after just 10 monthsAAP Woolworths shares have slipped after it announced retail expert Sally Macdonald's resignation as Big W chief executive … Wages rose 0.4% in September quarterAAP Domino's hails 'world's first' drone pizzaAAP Trump links off to good start: TurnbullAAP Sponsored  Market Data Currencies Currencies Name Price Change % Chg AUD / USD 0.7547 -0.0005 -0.07% AUD/USD AUD / GBP 0.6056 -0.0009 -0.15% AUD/GBP AUD / EUR 0.7025 -0.0015 -0.21% AUD/EUR Go To Currency Converter » On This Site HOME NEWS & OPINION TAX TIME 2016 INVESTING MY PORTFOLIOS PERSONAL FINANCE VIDEO Expert Opinion ALSO ON YAHOO7 Mail Stocks & Shares Forum Meet Single Women Meet Single Men TV Guide Easy Recipe Ideas Go Travelling Tips To Great Sex Breaking News Find Your Dream Car Weather Forecast Find A Job All Yahoo7 Services » Trending Now Socceroos Currency Converter HMAS Darwin NZ Home loans Carrie Fisher Mortgage calculator Dwayne Johnson Budget Rent a Car WGEA pay gap Free iTunes download Help / Suggestions Privacy Terms Quotes are real-time for NASDAQ, NYSE, and NYSEAmex when available.

Futures markets for the S&P 500 fell 5.01 percent and the tech-heavy NASDAQ lost 5.08 percent, reflecting the growing concerns among investors about the economic risks posed by a Trump presidency. The Dow Jones index fell 4.30 percent. As results came in pointing to an astonishing upset win by Trump, markets that had counted on Clinton to win were caught up in a growing wave of panic. Stocks had risen Tuesday, with Dow Jones index up 0.40 percent and the Nasdaq up 0.53 percent. Futures contracts, which fell while Wall Street was closed, reflect investor sentiment on what will happen down the road. The wave of panic also hit Asia as markets dropped at the opening bell, mainly in Bombay, which dropped 6.08 percent and Tokyo, 5.5 percent. Markets have long preferred Clinton to Trump, who is seen as unpredictable. His positions against free trade accords and immigration worry big companies and are seen as a possible curb to economic growth.

Photo: AFP New York: Investors suddenly became much more confident that Hillary Clinton will prevail over Donald Trump for a status quo outcome in the US presidential campaign—a Democrat in the White House reined in by Republicans in Congress. Option bets on where the S&P 500 Index will be on the day after Tuesday’s vote suggest Hillary Clinton has 71% chance of winning, up from 63% last week, Janus Capital Group Inc. said in an email. That leaves investors more aligned with prediction-market gamblers and polling-aggregator forecasts, which mostly give her better odds. The Janus analysis was consistent with market moves after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reaffirmed on Sunday that it won’t seek criminal charges related to Clinton’s email practices. The S&P 500 broke its longest losing streak in 36 years and regained most of what it had lost since the FBI reignited the email controversy on 28 October. That news had driven safer assets up and riskier ones down—hedges against a Republican upset that were all dialed back on Monday. More on US presidential elections The aftermath of a come-from-behind Trump victory would be similar to the fallout from the UK’s June vote to leave the European Union (EU). “We envision a violent flight to quality if Trump wins,” Barclays Plc said in a report. A Democratic sweep may also be disruptive, but that’s now a remote possibility. JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised a third potential surprise in a report that might produce a similar reaction. The title: “I demand a recount.” Over the longer term, both candidates want to increase spending and cut taxes, which would be bullish for stocks and bearish for fixed income. Below is a look at potential winners and losers. 1. Stocks Clinton wins: “The market has already priced in a Clinton victory,” said Margaret Yang, a CMC Markets analyst in Singapore. “Any upside will be limited if she wins.” Barclays Plc said in a report that the S&P 500 Index could gain as much as 3%. Societe Generale SA said the benchmark would hit 2,200, 3.2% above Monday’s close, immediately after a Clinton win and rise to 2,350 by mid-2017. Beyond an initial “risk-relief rally on the prospect of policy continuity and predictability”, Deutsche Bank AG said that Clinton’s plans to limit the capital gains tax break may “have negative/dampening impact on some key risk bellwether assets like equities into the turn of the year.” The biggest losers would be finance and drug companies. “A potential Democratic sweep would represent one of the toughest election outcomes for banks,” Morgan Stanley said in a report, citing the risk of tougher rules and tax changes that might hurt companies like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan. Moves against carried-interest rules that benefit asset managers, also targeted by Trump, would hurt firms including Janus Capital and Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. Under Clinton, pharmaceutical and biotech stocks “could be hit by renewed pressure to curb price increases on drugs,” BlackRock Inc. researchers said in a report, noting her complaints about rising costs. Citigroup Inc. cut its rating on the European health-care industry to underweight in September, citing US election risks. Drugmakers Novo Nordisk A/S and Roche Holding AG have trailed the broader market this year as Clinton’s prospects rose, with the shares gaining only during times when her polling numbers fell. Hospital operators and Medicaid providers such as HCA Holdings Inc. and Universal Health Services Inc. may benefit from continued Affordable Care Act subsidies, according to analysts from Strategas Research Partners, LPL Financial Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG. UBS Group AG sees education stocks rising under Clinton. Her plans to reduce dependence on fossil fuels would boost alternative energy producers, with Morgan Stanley touting the prospects of Sunrun Inc. and NextEra Energy Inc. under Clinton. Strategas also likes First Solar Inc. in that scenario. Evercore ISI adds General Electric Co., Tesla Motors Inc., SolarCity Corp. and Exelon Corp. to the list in its pre-election report. A Democratic sweep increases the odds for a minimum wage hike, which cuts both ways for consumer stocks, Morgan Stanley said. Trump wins: “Valuations of US equities are quite high, and a Trump victory will trigger a massive sell-off,” CMC’s Yang said. Many would consider that a classic “black swan event,” she added, so the reaction would be “much more severe” than Brexit, which caused the S&P 500 Index to fall 5.3% in two days as benchmarks in Europe and elsewhere lost even more. Barclays predicted an S&P 500 nosedive of as much as 13% if Trump wins. Citigroup equity strategist Tobias Levkovich put the hit at no more than 5% in a report. Societe Generale sees a drop to 1,950, or 8.5% lower than Monday. Judging the Republican’s longer-term impact is difficult to assess because “some of Trump’s policy proposals are so unconventional (trade, immigration) and others so vague (fiscal),” said John Normand, JPMorgan’s head of foreign exchange, commodities and international rates research, in a report. BlackRock’s analysis of the correlation between the two candidate’s polling numbers and sector stock performance suggest drugmakers, insurers and banks are expected to do better under Trump. Bloomberg News did a similar analysis for individual US stocks. Even some of these sectors, however, face Trump-related risks. He favours repealing Obamacare and allowing the importation of prescription drugs, which could hurt pharmaceutical companies, Morgan Stanley said. And finance companies may prefer Trump, but BlackRock warned that repealing the post-crisis Dodd-Frank law, derided by the industry’s Republican allies, may result in “simpler and blunter but equally onerous rules”. Companies that build and maintain civil infrastructure, such as Caterpillar Inc. and Ingersoll-Rand Corp., would have bigger opportunities for government work under Trump, given that his plans for such spending are much more ambitious than Clinton’s. The same holds true for military contractors, Credit Suisse said. Morgan Stanley sees NRG Energy Inc., which uses coal to produce electricity, benefiting under a Republican White House, due to less regulation and slower growth in the use of renewables. The bank said consumer stocks could be hurt by a Trump win because tougher immigration restrictions could crimp labour supply and consumer demand. Also read: Hillary Clinton win may pose pricing challenges for pharma firms: Report Given Trump’s support for incentives to encourage businesses to repatriate offshore cash, companies with big hordes overseas “should outperform”, UBS said, estimating that non-financial S&P 500 companies have $1.1 trillion “trapped” abroad. Companies that stand to gain the most are largely confined to the technology, health care, industrials and consumer discretionary sectors, UBS said, noting that Clinton has also mentioned repatriation. The Japanese stock market may get hit harder than others, falling as much as 10% due to the yen strengthening, Citigroup said in a report. “There could be investment opportunities in infrastructure names and military-related stocks in any subsequent correction,” the report said, citing Hitachi Ltd, Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd, among others. 2.Bonds Clinton wins: A victory by the Democrat would initially drive up yields as investors sell off Treasuries in favor of riskier assets, Bank of America Corp. analysts said in a report. Ripple effects would raise borrowing costs for individuals and corporations worldwide because US sovereigns are the global debt benchmark. Yields on 10-year US bonds have risen as much as 36 basis points since Clinton’s lead over Trump started widening in late July, and the bank’s analysts called the Democratic Party’s improving prospects “a major factor” behind that move. Market participants surveyed by Ian Lyngen, head of US rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, predicted an average increase of 5 basis points if Clinton wins, he said. Normand sees a much smaller reaction, titling the Clinton section of his report “next to nothing changes”. Over the longer term, a Clinton victory would do little to yields—as long as Republicans retain control of at least one chamber of Congress—because her fiscal stimulus would be relatively small, especially compared to Trump’s plans for bigger tax cuts and more infrastructure spending. A Democratic sweep would likely result in more spending and may drive yields higher. Municipal debt could gain under Clinton because any increased taxes she imposes on the wealthy would make tax-free bonds more attractive, BlackRock said. Trump Wins: In the two weeks after the UK gobsmacked pollsters and voted to leave the EU on 23 June, the US benchmark 10-year yield fell 39 basis points and didn’t return to pre-Brexit levels until September. Something akin to that may happen if Trump defies conventional wisdom. Credit Agricole SA predicts a “massive disjoint” that would send 10-year yields down at least 10 basis points if he prevails. Lyngen’s survey average predicted a smaller drop. JPMorgan’s Normand said the yield would fall below 1.7% in the days after a Trump win, from 1.83% on Monday. After the dust settles, Trump’s tax cuts and infrastructure-spending plans may drive yields back up, especially if Republicans hold both the House and Senate. That impact could be exaggerated if the Republican’s isolationist foreign policy prompts countries with large Treasury stakes to unload them, Credit Agricole analysts said. Fiscal largess would also benefit inflation-linked bonds, which already are outperforming nominal securities this year. Yields would only remain flat under Trump, according to Bank of America, in the unlikeliest event of all: President Trump finds himself up against Democrats controlling both houses of Congress, because they would resist his massive tax cuts. Trump’s support for fossil fuels could spur a rebound for energy industry bonds, especially high-yield ones, after two years of major losses in the commodities slump, Wells Fargo & Co. said in a report. As for munis, “Trump’s plan to slash personal tax rates could deal a blow to the asset class,” BlackRock’s report said.

Down the road, Bank of America sees the greenback gaining under Clinton only if the Democrats take Congress. Emerging-market currencies would see “modest and transitory” gains because a Clinton win “is mostly—but not fully—priced in”, though Russia may be an exception, Societe Generale said. Mexico’s peso would benefit the most, the report said. Citigroup told its clients that there might not be major peso gains if Clinton wins. The currency has acted as a barometer of the presidential contest, moving in tandem with her chances of defeating a candidate who wants to revamp trade deals, restrict immigration and make the US’s southern neighbour pay for a border wall. If Clinton triumphs, the peso will strengthen to 18.25 per dollar, a 1.7% gain from Monday, and the Canadian dollar would also rise, Normand of JPMorgan said before the latest FBI news. Elsewhere, most Asian currencies would rally 2% or so in relief, said Cliff Tan, a strategist in Hong Kong for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. Trump wins: The foreign exchange markets this month suggested what might happen if the Republican triumphs, with the dollar tumbling against most major currencies and the Mexican peso plunging before Monday’s recovery on the FBI’s announcement about Clinton’s emails. Societe Generale sees Mexico’s currency at 23 per dollar after a win by the Republican, 19% weaker than Monday, while Bank of America said traders already “have gone a long way toward pricing in a surprise Trump victory”. JPMorgan’s Normand predicted one-day slides of 8% for the peso and 5% for the Canadian dollar—based on a President Trump’s power to impose protectionist measures unilaterally. The currencies of the US’s neighbours would then recover some, he said, with Mexico’s central bank intervening to defend the peso and Congress moving to restrain Trump’s trade policies. Actions by Mexican authorities “will be seen as inevitable,” said George Lei, a Bloomberg currency strategist. Other developed-market currencies including the yen, euro, pound and franc may also gain on concern that China would dump US assets and the Fed would delay tightening monetary policy, analysts said. Normand sees the yen gaining 3%. Societe Generale sees it strengthening to 99 per dollar, 5.6% more than Monday. Commodity-linked currencies including the Canadian dollar also “would lose ground”, BMO said. The greenback could then rally in a three-to-nine month horizon as Republicans usher in tax cuts and other fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth, Bank of America said. Also read: Billionaires add $35.4 billion on hopes for Hillary Clinton win in US presidential polls The candidate’s hostility toward China—including threats of steep tariffs over alleged currency manipulation—likely would drive the offshore yuan down about 3 percent by year’s end, said Ken Cheung, a foreign-exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd in Hong Kong. Longer term, the currency may fall more gradually under Trump as he exerts political pressure on the country’s leaders to slow its depreciation, said Xu Gao, an economist at Everbright Securities Co. in Beijing. Risk aversion in the aftermath of a Trump win would also push down other developing-world currencies on fears that his protectionist stances could hurt emerging economies by reducing imports from them. That “could be negative for high-yielder countries,” Credit Agricole said in a report. The South Korean won may take a hit, given questions that Trump has raised about the need for US troops on the North Korean border. “Downward pressure on EM FX is likely to be sustained for quite some time” with a Trump win, Societe Generale said in a report on Monday, citing the Turkish lira and Taiwanese dollar as among those at risk. Russia’s ruble “would benefit the most from Trump’s alleged pandering” to the regime of Vladimir Putin. If Republicans sweep, the euro might fall against the dollar, BMO said, because they would be inclined to open a foreign-earnings repatriation window for American companies to bring money back home, and “a high concentration of US-based multinationals’ earnings are held” in Europe. 4.Emerging markets Clinton wins: It’ll be risk-on if the Democrat retains control of the White House, which bodes well for developing markets. Investors may respond by bidding up Chinese defence shares because Clinton comes across as the more hawkish candidate, said Francis Cheung, head of China and Hong Kong strategy at CLSA Ltd. Commodity producers in the developing world might rally on expectations that US demand will increase along with infrastructure spending. Trump wins: “I can’t think of any country that would benefit if Trump wins,” CMC Markets’ Yang said. Evercore’s report mentioned one nation that might get a boost, suggesting investors buy Russian equities to hedge against the Clinton-leaning polls being wrong. Nadia Kazakova, a Russian oil and gas specialist for Saxo Group, said she’s not convinced the country would benefit economically from Trump. If he wins, the global shock “could strike Russian markets much harder than others” due to risk aversion and falling commodities. “And as Trump makes America great again, would he still have the heart for a great deal with not-so-great Russia?” she wrote in a report. Citigroup sees the MSCI Emerging Markets Index immediately falling at least 10%, with Mexican stocks leading the way down. The Institute for International Finance explained why in a report on Thursday: “Nearly 80% of Mexico’s exports go to the US,” and “workers’ remittances are one of the three largest sources of foreign currency,” behind oil and tourism. One possible bright spot for Mexico: Construction companies such as Cemex SAB de CV may be positioned for contracts to build Trump’s proposed border wall. In Asia, “China will bear the brunt of risks if Trump wins,” said Ken Peng, an investment strategist at Citi Private Bank in Hong Kong, by phone. “He’ll probably introduce trade policies targeted against China,” weakening its economy. Protectionist US policies also would be “bad for a lot of economies that rely a lot on exports”, said Ben Bei, an analyst at CIMB Securities Ltd in Hong Kong. Peng said exporters from South Korea and Taiwan are among those with the most to lose. Yang adds Southeast Asia exporters to the list, including companies in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. Citigroup called Latin America “most vulnerable” to US protectionism. To the extent that Trump is less welcoming to workers from abroad, his victory may hurt the Philippines’ broader economy, which gets the bulk of its overseas remittances from Filipinos employed in the US, Yang said. Capital Economics put that country, followed by Taiwan and South Korea, as the Asian countries “with the most to lose” from Trump. “India and Indonesia will be least affected if Trump wins,” due to their robust domestic growth, Peng said. Pakistan should also be “relatively unaffected,” Capital Economics said. 5.Commodities Clinton wins: Her environmental policies, especially her promise to combat climate change, will put pressure on coal and oil. The natural gas market could get a boost from her pledge to wean power plants off coal by using gas as “a bridge” to more reliance on renewables. Trump wins: Natural gas prices likely would suffer as coal benefits under Trump. He has promised to roll back environmental rules that squeeze coal out of the US power market and promoted “clean coal” during one of the debates. Bloomberg Intelligence in September estimated that a victory by the Republican would shave 11% off natural gas demand in 2030 from last year’s levels, boosting coal use. Oil prices could get a lift from the return of a risk premium if Trump continues with the “bellicose language that’s been heard on the campaign trail” about Iran and scraps President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with the country, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York hedge fund focused on energy. JPMorgan’s Normand sees Brent crude oil rising to $54 a barrel by year’s end, a 17% gain from Monday, but not before falling 5% or so initially “in sympathy with equities, much as occurred after Brexit.” Gold, platinum and silver would the “biggest winners” if Trump wins, said Yang, the CMC Markets analyst. After the FBI’s surprise announcement about the Clinton email inquiry on 28 October, all precious metals rose before giving back much of those gains on Monday. Normand sees gold immediately rising to $1,350 an ounce if Trump wins, about 5% higher than Monday, before retreating in the next month to $1,225. Copper may also get a bounce, Barclays said, citing moves in the metal’s price during the campaign suggesting “a Trump-related premium” based on his plans to boost spending on bridges, roads and the like. Normand disagrees, calling Trump’s “gargantuan infrastructure ambitions” too vague and unrealistic to support base-metal prices for long. Given the danger his trade agenda poses to Asian growth, he sees copper immediately falling 3% if Trump wins.

U.S. stocks on Monday had their best day since March on a percentage basis after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said its review of a new batch of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's emails won't lead to charges. Gains were broad, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reclaiming the key 18,000 level and the S&P 500 snapping its nine-day losing streak, the longest since 1980. The slide had been attributed partly to polls showing a closer contest between Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 371.32 points, or 2.1%, to close at 18,259.60. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 119.80 points, or 2.4%, to end at 5,166.17. The S&P 500 index rose 46.34 points, or 2.2%, to finish at 2,131.52. Financials, industrials, health care and technology paced the advance. The controlled action likely came with the understanding that the presidential race remains fairly tight. In the financial sector, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan Chase each gained more than 3%. In the technology sector, Dow components Intel and Microsoft gained 3.2% and 3.0%, respectively. Intel finished at the top of the price-weighted average. Today's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for September. Total outstanding consumer credit increased by $19.3 billion in September (consensus $17.5 billion) after increasing an upwardly revised $26.8 billion (from $25.9 billion) in August. The dollar saw big gains, with the ICE Dollar Index which measures the greenback against a half-dozen rivals, up 0.7%. Gold was down sharply, after gaining 2.2% last week. December gold ended today's session down $24.60 (-1.9%) to $1279.90/oz. December silver closed today's session $0.21 lower (-1.1%) at $18.16/oz. Oil prices rose more than 1%. Crude oil rallied off of 6-week lows hit on Friday, snapped its 6-session loss streak, saw a boost ahead of tomorrow's Presidential election. December crude oil futures rose $0.74 (+1.7%) to $44.82/barrel. Treasuries finished on a lower note as the long end of the curve underperformed. The yield on the 2-yr note finished higher by three basis points (0.82%) while the yield on the 10-yr note ended up five basis points (1.83%). Today's trading volume was above the average of 861 million as more than 889 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor. Tomorrow's economic data will be limited to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for September, which will be released at 10:00 ET.

Capital Market Business Standard http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/wap/images/bs_logo_amp.png 177 22 Broad rally at Wall Street ahead of Presidential Election Financials, industrials, health care and technology sectors paced the advance The stock market began the week on a broadly higher note on Monday, 07 November 2016 at Wall Street as diminished political uncertainty boosted risk appetite ahead of tomorrow's US presidential race. U.S. stocks on Monday had their best day since March on a percentage basis after the Federal Bureau of Investigation said its review of a new batch of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's emails won't lead to charges. Gains were broad, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average reclaiming the key 18,000 level and the S&P 500 snapping its nine-day losing streak, the longest since 1980. The slide had been attributed partly to polls showing a closer contest between Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump. The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 371.32 points, or 2.1%, to close at 18,259.60. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 119.80 points, or 2.4%, to end at 5,166.17. The S&P 500 index rose 46.34 points, or 2.2%, to finish at 2,131.52. Financials, industrials, health care and technology paced the advance. The controlled action likely came with the understanding that the presidential race remains fairly tight. In the financial sector, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan Chase each gained more than 3%. In the technology sector, Dow components Intel and Microsoft gained 3.2% and 3.0%, respectively. Intel finished at the top of the price-weighted average. Today's economic data was limited to the Consumer Credit report for September. Total outstanding consumer credit increased by $19.3 billion in September (consensus $17.5 billion) after increasing an upwardly revised $26.8 billion (from $25.9 billion) in August. The dollar saw big gains, with the ICE Dollar Index which measures the greenback against a half-dozen rivals, up 0.7%. Gold was down sharply, after gaining 2.2% last week. December gold ended today's session down $24.60 (-1.9%) to $1279.90/oz. December silver closed today's session $0.21 lower (-1.1%) at $18.16/oz. Oil prices rose more than 1%. Crude oil rallied off of 6-week lows hit on Friday, snapped its 6-session loss streak, saw a boost ahead of tomorrow's Presidential election. December crude oil futures rose $0.74 (+1.7%) to $44.82/barrel. Treasuries finished on a lower note as the long end of the curve underperformed. The yield on the 2-yr note finished higher by three basis points (0.82%) while the yield on the 10-yr note ended up five basis points (1.83%). Today's trading volume was above the average of 861 million as more than 889 million shares changed hands at the NYSE floor. Tomorrow's economic data will be limited to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for September, which will be released at 10:00 ET.

Picture: Reuters. Related Articles How US election could impact SA Don’t panic when stock market goes crazy after US election Why Brexit will trump Donald victory in market volatility Trump vs Clinton: The world’s destiny in their hands Global markets shudder on prospect of Trump presidency Emerging stocks slide most in three weeks as Trump leads   New York - Investors are dialling back hedges against a Donald Trump upset victory without abandoning them. Traders entered the final trading session before US voters head to the polls seeming less certain of the outcome than prediction-market gamblers and polling aggregators. As of last week’s close, options bets on where the S&P 500 Index would be the day after the election suggested Hillary Clinton had a 63% chance of becoming president, Janus Capital said in an e-mail on Saturday. Most polling-aggregation forecasts put her odds of beating Donald Trump at more than 80%, with FiveThirtyEight an outlier at 68%. On websites that take wagers on the winner, Clinton’s odds are near or above 80%, boosted by Sunday’s news that the Federal Bureau of Investigation won’t revisit its decision against seeking criminal charges related to her e-mail practices. The Janus analysis was consistent with how the financial markets behaved on Friday: Traders increased most hedges against a stunning upset by Trump even as Clinton’s slide in the polls eased. With investors worried that expectations for a status quo outcome - Democrat in the White House kept in check by Republicans in Congress - could be upended, the S&P 500 fell for the ninth straight session, its longest losing streak since a few weeks after Ronald Reagan’s 1980 election. Clinton’s lead had plunged when the FBI reignited controversy over her e-mails on October 28, driving haven assets up and riskier ones down, as shown by this chart: Following the FBI’s announcement on Sunday, all of those assets have become less hedged against Trump prevailing. The Mexican peso gave back all its losses and then some. The move toward safer assets is in line with - though less dramatic than - what analysts predict if the Republican wins, much like the aftermath of the UK’s June vote to leave the European Union. “In case of a Trump win, we envision a violent flight to quality,” Barclays said in a report. A Democratic sweep may also be disruptive, but that possibility is increasingly remote. JPMorgan Chase raised a third potential surprise in a report that it said would produce a similar market reaction. The title: “I demand a recount.” Over the longer term, both candidates want to increase spending and cut taxes, which would be bullish for stocks and bearish for fixed income. Below is a look at potential winners and losers. But first, a caveat. Investors’ immediate reaction to US elections often doesn’t last. Stocks Clinton Wins: “The market has already priced in a Clinton victory,” said Margaret Yang, a CMC Markets analyst in Singapore. “Any upside will be limited if she wins.” Barclays said in a report that the S&P 500 Index could gain as much as 3%. Beyond an initial “risk-relief rally on the prospect of policy continuity and predictability,” Deutsche Bank said that Clinton’s plans to limit the capital gains tax break may “have negative/dampening impact on some key risk bellwether assets like equities into the turn of the year.” The biggest losers would be finance and drug companies. “A potential Democratic sweep would represent one of the toughest election outcomes for banks,” Morgan Stanley said in a report, citing the risk of tougher rules and tax changes that might hurt companies like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. Moves against carried-interest rules that benefit asset managers, also targeted by Trump, would hurt firms including Janus Capital and Waddell & Reed Financial. Under Clinton, pharmaceutical and biotech stocks “could be hit by renewed pressure to curb price increases on drugs,” BlackRock researchers said in a report, noting her complaints about rising costs. Citigroup cut its rating on the European health-care industry to underweight in September, citing US election risks. Drugmakers Novo Nordisk A/S and Roche Holding have trailed the broader market this year as Clinton’s prospects rose, with the shares gaining only during times when her polling numbers fell. Hospital operators and Medicaid providers such as HCA Holdings and Universal Health Services may benefit from continued Affordable Care Act subsidies, according to analysts from Strategas Research Partners, LPL Financial Holdings and Credit Suisse Group. Her plans to reduce dependence on fossil fuels would boost alternative energy producers, with Morgan Stanley touting the prospects of Sunrun and NextEra Energy under Clinton. Strategas also likes First Solar in that scenario. Evercore ISI adds General Electric, Tesla Motors, SolarCity and Exelon to the list in its pre-election report. A Democratic sweep increases the odds for a minimum wage hike, which cuts both ways for consumer stocks, Morgan Stanley said. Trump Wins: “Valuations of US equities are quite high, and a Trump victory will trigger a massive selloff,” CMC’s Yang said. Many would consider that a classic “ black swan event,” she added, so the reaction would be “much more severe” than Brexit, which caused the S&P 500 Index to fall 5.3% in two days as benchmarks in Europe and elsewhere lost even more. Barclays predicted an S&P 500 nosedive of as much as 13% if Trump wins. Citigroup equity strategist Tobias Levkovich put the hit at no more than 5% in a report. Judging the Republican’s longer-term impact is difficult to assess because “some of Trump’s policy proposals are so unconventional (trade, immigration) and others so vague (fiscal),” said John Normand, JPMorgan’s head of foreign exchange, commodities and international rates research, in a report on Friday. BlackRock’s analysis of the correlation between the two candidate’s polling numbers and sector stock performance suggest drugmakers, insurers and banks are expected to do better under Trump. Bloomberg News did a similar analysis for individual U.S. stocks. Even some of these sectors, however, face Trump-related risks. He favours repealing Obamacare and allowing the importation of prescription drugs, which could hurt pharmaceutical companies, Morgan Stanley said. And finance companies may prefer Trump, but BlackRock warned that repealing the post-crisis Dodd-Frank law, derided by the industry’s Republican allies, may result in “simpler and blunter but equally onerous rules.” Companies that build and maintain civil infrastructure, such as  Caterpillar and Ingersoll-Rand, would have bigger opportunities for government work under Trump, given that his plans for such spending are much more ambitious than Clinton’s. The same holds true for military contractors, Credit Suisse said. Morgan Stanley sees NRG Energy, which uses coal to produce electricity, benefiting under a Republican White House, due to less regulation and slower growth in the use of renewables. The bank said consumer stocks could be hurt by a Trump win because tougher immigration restrictions could crimp labour supply and consumer demand. The Japanese stock market may get hit harder than others, falling as much as 10% due to the yen strengthening, Citigroup said Friday in a report. “There could be investment opportunities in infrastructure names and military-related stocks in any subsequent correction,” the report said, citing Hitachi,  Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, among others. Bonds Clinton Wins: A victory by the Democrat would initially drive up yields as investors sell off Treasuries in favour of riskier assets, Bank of America analysts said in a report. Ripple effects would raise borrowing costs for individuals and corporations worldwide because US sovereigns are the global debt benchmark. Yields on 10-year US bonds have risen as much as 36 basis points since Clinton’s lead over Trump started widening in late July, and the bank’s analysts called the Democratic Party’s improving prospects “a major factor” behind that move. They’ve fallen a bit since the October 28 announcement that the FBI would examine more Clinton-related e-mails. Market participants surveyed by Ian Lyngen, head of US rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, predicted an average increase of 5 basis points if Clinton wins, he said. Normand sees a much smaller reaction, titling the Clinton section of his report “next to nothing changes.” Over the longer term, a Clinton victory would do little to yields - as long as Republicans retain control of at least one chamber of Congress - because her fiscal stimulus would be relatively small, especially compared to Trump’s plans for bigger tax cuts and more infrastructure spending. A Democratic sweep would likely result in more spending and may drive yields higher. Municipal debt could gain under Clinton because any increased taxes she imposes on the wealthy would make tax-free bonds more attractive, BlackRock said. Trump Wins: In the two weeks after the UK gobsmacked pollsters and voted to leave the EU on June 23, the US benchmark 10-year yield fell 39 basis points and didn’t return to pre-Brexit levels until September. Something akin to that may happen if Trump defies conventional wisdom. Credit Agricole SA predicts a “massive disjoint” that would send 10-year yields down at least 10 basis points if he prevails. Lyngen’s survey average predicted a smaller drop. JPMorgan’s Normand said the yield would fall below 1.7% in the days after a Trump win, from 1.78% on Friday. After the dust settles, Trump’s tax cuts and infrastructure-spending plans may drive yields back up, especially if Republicans hold both the House and Senate. That impact could be exaggerated if the Republican’s isolationist foreign policy prompts countries with large Treasury stakes to unload them, Credit Agricole analysts said. Fiscal largess would also benefit inflation-linked bonds, which already are outperforming nominal securities this year. Yields would only remain flat under Trump, according to Bank of America, in the unlikeliest event of all: President Trump finds himself up against Democrats controlling both houses of Congress, because they would resist his massive tax cuts. Trump’s support for fossil fuels could spur a rebound for energy industry bonds, especially high-yield ones, after two years of major losses in the commodities slump, Wells Fargo said in a report. As for munis, “Trump’s plan to slash personal tax rates could deal a blow to the asset class,” BlackRock’s report said. Currencies Clinton Wins: The US dollar would gain versus other developed-market currencies, with the Democrat heading toward the White House as traders focus attention on the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in December, according to Capital Economics, a London research firm. Down the road, Bank of America sees the greenback gaining under Clinton only if the Democrats take Congress. Emerging-market currencies would see “modest and transitory” gains because a Clinton win “is mostly - but not fully - priced in,” though Russia may be an exception, Societe Generale SA said in a report. Mexico’s peso would benefit the most, the report said. It has acted as a barometer of the presidential contest, moving in tandem with her chances of defeating a candidate who wants to revamp trade deals, restrict immigration and make the US’s southern neighbour pay for a border wall. If Clinton triumphs, the peso would gain 4.3% gain from Friday’s close, and the Canadian dollar would also rise, though not quite as much, Normand of JPMorgan said before the latest FBI news. Elsewhere, most Asian currencies would rally 2% or so in relief, said Cliff Tan, a strategist in Hong Kong for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. Trump Wins: The foreign-exchange markets this week are suggesting what might happen if the Republican triumphs, with the dollar tumbling against most major currencies and the Mexican peso bucking the trend as one of the worst performers against the greenback. Societe Generale sees Mexico’s currency 17% weaker than Friday’s close, while Bank of America said traders already “have gone a long way toward pricing in a surprise Trump victory.” JPMorgan’s Normand predicted one-day slides of 8% for the peso and 5% for the Canadian dollar - based on a President Trump’s power to impose protectionist measures unilaterally. The currencies of the US’s neighbours would then recover some, he said, with Mexico’s central bank intervening to defend the peso and Congress moving to restrain Trump’s trade policies. Other developed-market currencies including the yen, euro, pound and franc may also gain on concern that China would dump US assets and the Fed would delay tightening monetary policy, analysts said. Normand sees the yen gaining 3%. Commodity-linked currencies including the Canadian dollar also “would lose ground,” BMO said. The greenback could then rally in a three- to nine-month horizon as Republicans usher in tax cuts and other fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth, Bank of America said. The candidate’s hostility toward China - including threats of steep tariffs over alleged currency manipulation - likely would drive the offshore yuan down about 3% by year’s end, said Ken Cheung, a foreign-exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank in Hong Kong. Longer term, the currency may fall more gradually under Trump as he exerts political pressure on the country’s leaders to slow its depreciation, said Xu Gao, an economist at Everbright Securities in Beijing. Risk aversion in the aftermath of a Trump win would also push down other developing-world currencies on fears that his protectionist stances could hurt emerging economies by reducing imports from them. That “could be negative for high-yielder countries,” Credit Agricole said in a report. The South Korean won may take a hit, given questions that Trump has raised about the need for U.S. troops on the North Korean border. If Republicans sweep, the euro might fall against the dollar, BMO said, because they would be inclined to open a foreign-earnings repatriation window for American companies to bring money back home, and “a high concentration of U.S.-based multinationals’ earnings are held” in Europe. Emerging Markets Clinton Wins: It’ll be risk-on if the Democrat retains control of the White House, which bodes well for developing markets. Investors may respond by bidding up Chinese defence shares because Clinton comes across as the more hawkish candidate, said Francis Cheung, head of China and Hong Kong strategy at CLSA. Commodity producers in the developing world might rally on expectations that US demand will increase along with infrastructure spending. Trump Wins: “I can’t think of any country that would benefit if Trump wins,” CMC Markets’ Yang said. Evercore’s report mentioned one nation that might get a boost, suggesting investors buy Russian equities to hedge against the Clinton-leaning polls being wrong. Nadia Kazakova, a Russian oil and gas specialist for Saxo Group, said she’s not convinced the country would benefit economically from Trump. If he wins, the global shock “could strike Russian markets much harder than others” due to risk aversion and falling commodities. “And as Trump makes America great again, would he still have the heart for a great deal with not-so-great Russia?” she wrote in a report. Citigroup sees the MSCI Emerging Markets Index immediately falling at least 10%, with Mexican stocks leading the way down. The Institute for International Finance explained why in a report on Thursday: “Nearly 80% of Mexico’s exports go to the US” and “workers’ remittances are one of the three largest sources of foreign currency,” behind oil and tourism. One possible bright spot for Mexico: Construction companies such as Cemex SAB de CV may be positioned for contracts to build Trump’s proposed border wall. In Asia, “China will bear the brunt of risks if Trump wins,” said Ken Peng, an investment strategist at Citi Private Bank in Hong Kong, by phone. “He’ll probably introduce trade policies targeted against China,” weakening its economy. Protectionist US policies also would be “bad for a lot of economies that rely a lot on exports,” said Ben Bei, an analyst at CIMB Securities in Hong Kong. Peng said exporters from South Korea and Taiwan are among those with the most to lose. Yang adds Southeast Asia exporters to the list, including companies in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. Citigroup called Latin America “most vulnerable” to U.S. protectionism. To the extent that Trump is less welcoming to workers from abroad, his victory may hurt the Philippines’ broader economy, which gets the bulk of its overseas remittances from Filipinos employed in the US, Yang said. “India and Indonesia will be least affected if Trump wins,” due to their robust domestic growth, Peng said. Commodities Clinton Wins: Her environmental policies, especially her promise to combat climate change, will put pressure on coal and oil. The natural gas market could get a boost from her pledge to wean power plants off coal by using gas as “a bridge” to more reliance on renewables. Trump Wins: Natural gas prices likely would suffer as coal benefits under Trump. He has promised to roll back environmental rules that squeeze coal out of the US power market and promoted “clean coal” during one of the debates. Bloomberg Intelligence in September estimated that a victory by the Republican would shave 11% off natural gas demand in 2030 from last year’s levels, boosting coal use. Oil prices could get a lift from the return of a risk premium if Trump continues with the “bellicose language that’s been heard on the campaign trail” about Iran and scraps President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with the country, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York hedge fund focused on energy. JPMorgan’s Normand sees Brent crude oil rising to $54 a barrel by year’s end, an 18% gain from Friday, but not before falling 5% initially “in sympathy with equities, much as occurred after Brexit.” Gold, platinum and silver would the “biggest winners” if Trump wins, said Yang, the CMC Markets analyst. Since the day before the FBI’s surprise announcement about the Clinton e-mail inquiry on October 28, all precious metals have risen. Normand sees gold immediately rising to $1 350 an ounce if Trump wins, 3.4% higher than Friday, before retreating in the next month to $1 225. Copper may also get a bounce, Barclays said, citing moves in the metal’s price during the campaign suggesting “a Trump-related premium” based on his plans to boost spending on bridges, roads and the like. Normand disagrees, calling Trump’s “gargantuan infrastructure ambitions” too vague and unrealistic to support base-metal prices for long. Given the danger his trade agenda poses to Asian growth, he sees copper immediately falling 3% if Trump wins. Are you following the US Election? Where in SA will you be watching?

Starting next year, Chase Pay will become the first third-party digital wallet on Wal-Mart’s website and app, they said on Thursday. Customers can pay within the app with any major credit, debit, pre-paid or Walmart gift card. Daniel Eckert, senior vice-president of services at Wal-Mart U.S., said in an interview late on Friday that the retailer would tweak its marketing for the app after the most frequent users turned out to be Gen X customers, born from 1965 to 1967, and baby boomers born from 1946 to 1964. “The target demographic during the launch of a technology product tends to be younger, more male, so we have had that target market in mind,” Eckert said. U.S. mobile payments accounted for an estimated $67 billion in 2015, and are expected to grow this year to $83 billion, or 24 percent of all purchases made via smartphones, according to the latest Forrester Research data. Apple Inc’s Apple Pay or Alphabet Inc’s Android Pay are the most popular digital wallets, and U.S. retailers have launched many mobile payment apps in the last two years. But acceptance has been slow, largely because most systems require new equipment at stores. Wal-Mart Pay was launched in December 2015 and can be used in all of the retailer’s 4,600 U.S. stores. Customers at the checkout counter must choose the payment option within the app on their smartphone, and activate the camera to scan the code at the register. An e-receipt is sent to the app. Eckert also said more than 90 percent of transactions on the app involve customers are using the service more than three to four times a month. He declined to give the overall number of users who use Wal-Mart Pay.

Regardless of what is your need, you will be able to find a card that suit you. There are credit cards that offers rewards for every day purchases, travel cards that rewards you when you use it to pay for your travel expenses, and card with long APR interest free period. The following are the five best credit cards for senior citizens. 1. Chase Slate Chase Slate is a great card for seniors because the 15 month introductory period will have help you to save a lot of money on the interest. Seniors can avoid becoming stressful at making sure they must pay on due date because it doesn’t charge any penalty APR. The downside of Chase Slate is that it doesn’t have any rewards program. 2. Citi Simplicity Card Citi Simplicity Card is recognized as the card with the longest APR interest free period. Seniors who sign up for Citi Simplicity Card don’t have to pay interest for 21 months. The card also does not charge any penalty APR or late fee so you don’t have to be afraid of having to come up with the additional money to pay the bill if you are late in making the repayment. The card is not suitable for traveling because it has a 3% transaction fee. The card also does not have any rewards program in place. 3. Chase Freedom Chase Freedom is waived for APR interest for the first 15 months. The card offers $150 sign up bonus for anyone who have spent a minimum of $500 on purchases within 3 months. The rewards program will reward card holders with 5% cash back on rotating categories for up to a maximum spending of $1,500 in each quarter.

American Express Blue Cash Preferred American Express Blue Cash Preferred is one of the best cards to use for everyday expenses.

Option bets on where the S&P 500 Index will be on the day after Tuesday’s vote suggest Hillary Clinton has 71 percent chance of winning, up from 63 percent last week, Janus Capital Group Inc. said in an e-mail. That leaves investors more aligned with prediction-market gamblers and polling-aggregator forecasts, which mostly give her better odds. The Janus analysis was consistent with market moves after the Federal Bureau of Investigation reaffirmed on Sunday that it won’t seek criminal charges related to Clinton’s e-mail practices. The S&P 500 broke its longest losing streak in 36 years and regained most of what it had lost since the FBI reignited the e-mail controversy on Oct. 28. That news had driven safer assets up and riskier ones down -- hedges against a Republican upset that were all dialed back on Monday, as shown by this chart: The aftermath of a come-from-behind Trump victory would be similar to the fallout from the U.K.’s June vote to leave the European Union. “We envision a violent flight to quality” if Trump wins, Barclays Plc said in a report. A Democratic sweep may also be disruptive, but that’s now a remote possibility. JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised a third potential surprise in a report that might produce a similar reaction. The title: “I demand a recount.” What Happens If Nobody Wins the Presidency: QuickTake Q&A Over the longer term, both candidates want to increase spending and cut taxes, which would be bullish for stocks and bearish for fixed income. Below is a look at potential winners and losers. But first, a caveat. Investors’ immediate reaction to U.S. elections often doesn’t last, as illustrated here: With that... Stocks Clinton Wins: “The market has already priced in a Clinton victory,” said Margaret Yang, a CMC Markets analyst in Singapore. “Any upside will be limited if she wins.” Barclays Plc said in a report that the S&P 500 Index could gain as much as 3 percent. Societe Generale SA said the benchmark would hit 2,200, 3.2 percent above Monday’s close, immediately after a Clinton win and rise to 2,350 by mid-2017. Beyond an initial “risk-relief rally on the prospect of policy continuity and predictability,” Deutsche Bank AG said that Clinton’s plans to limit the capital gains tax break may “have negative/dampening impact on some key risk bellwether assets like equities into the turn of the year.” The biggest losers would be finance and drug companies. “A potential Democratic sweep would represent one of the toughest election outcomes for banks,” Morgan Stanley said in a report, citing the risk of tougher rules and tax changes that might hurt companies like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan. Moves against carried-interest rules that benefit asset managers, also targeted by Trump, would hurt firms including Janus Capital and Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. Under Clinton, pharmaceutical and biotech stocks “could be hit by renewed pressure to curb price increases on drugs,” BlackRock Inc. researchers said in a report, noting her complaints about rising costs. Citigroup Inc. cut its rating on the European health-care industry to underweight in September, citing U.S. election risks. Drugmakers Novo Nordisk A/S and Roche Holding AG have trailed the broader market this year as Clinton’s prospects rose, with the shares gaining only during times when her polling numbers fell. Hospital operators and Medicaid providers such as HCA Holdings Inc. and Universal Health Services Inc. may benefit from continued Affordable Care Act subsidies, according to analysts from Strategas Research Partners, LPL Financial Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG. UBS Group AG sees education stocks rising under Clinton. Her plans to reduce dependence on fossil fuels would boost alternative energy producers, with Morgan Stanley touting the prospects of Sunrun Inc. and NextEra Energy Inc. under Clinton. Strategas also likes First Solar Inc. in that scenario. Evercore ISI adds General Electric Co., Tesla Motors Inc., SolarCity Corp. and Exelon Corp. to the list in its pre-election report. A Democratic sweep increases the odds for a minimum wage hike, which cuts both ways for consumer stocks, Morgan Stanley said. Trump Wins: “Valuations of U.S. equities are quite high, and a Trump victory will trigger a massive selloff,” CMC’s Yang said. Many would consider that a classic “black swan event,” she added, so the reaction would be “much more severe” than Brexit, which caused the S&P 500 Index to fall 5.3 percent in two days as benchmarks in Europe and elsewhere lost even more. Barclays predicted an S&P 500 nosedive of as much as 13 percent if Trump wins. Citigroup equity strategist Tobias Levkovich put the hit at no more than 5 percent in a report. Societe Generale sees a drop to 1,950, or 8.5 percent lower than Monday. Judging the Republican’s longer-term impact is difficult to assess because “some of Trump’s policy proposals are so unconventional (trade, immigration) and others so vague (fiscal),” said John Normand, JPMorgan’s head of foreign exchange, commodities and international rates research, in a report. BlackRock’s analysis of the correlation between the two candidate’s polling numbers and sector stock performance suggest drugmakers, insurers and banks are expected to do better under Trump. Bloomberg News did a similar analysis for individual U.S. stocks. Even some of these sectors, however, face Trump-related risks. He favors repealing Obamacare and allowing the importation of prescription drugs, which could hurt pharmaceutical companies, Morgan Stanley said. And finance companies may prefer Trump, but BlackRock warned that repealing the post-crisis Dodd-Frank law, derided by the industry’s Republican allies, may result in “simpler and blunter but equally onerous rules.” Companies that build and maintain civil infrastructure, such as Caterpillar Inc. and Ingersoll-Rand Corp., would have bigger opportunities for government work under Trump, given that his plans for such spending are much more ambitious than Clinton’s. The same holds true for military contractors, Credit Suisse said. Morgan Stanley sees NRG Energy Inc., which uses coal to produce electricity, benefiting under a Republican White House, due to less regulation and slower growth in the use of renewables. The bank said consumer stocks could be hurt by a Trump win because tougher immigration restrictions could crimp labor supply and consumer demand. Given Trump’s support for incentives to encourage businesses to repatriate offshore cash, companies with big hordes overseas “should outperform,” UBS said, estimating that non-financial S&P 500 companies have $1.1 trillion “trapped” abroad. Companies that stand to gain the most are largely confined to the technology, health care, industrials and consumer discretionary sectors, UBS said, noting that Clinton has also mentioned repatriation. The Japanese stock market may get hit harder than others, falling as much as 10 percent due to the yen strengthening, Citigroup said in a report. “There could be investment opportunities in infrastructure names and military-related stocks in any subsequent correction,” the report said, citing Hitachi Ltd., Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., among others. Bonds Clinton Wins: A victory by the Democrat would initially drive up yields as investors sell off Treasuries in favor of riskier assets, Bank of America Corp. analysts said in a report. Ripple effects would raise borrowing costs for individuals and corporations worldwide because U.S. sovereigns are the global debt benchmark. Yields on 10-year U.S. bonds have risen as much as 36 basis points since Clinton’s lead over Trump started widening in late July, and the bank’s analysts called the Democratic Party’s improving prospects “a major factor” behind that move. Market participants surveyed by Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, predicted an average increase of 5 basis points if Clinton wins, he said. Normand sees a much smaller reaction, titling the Clinton section of his report “next to nothing changes.” Over the longer term, a Clinton victory would do little to yields -- as long as Republicans retain control of at least one chamber of Congress -- because her fiscal stimulus would be relatively small, especially compared to Trump’s plans for bigger tax cuts and more infrastructure spending. A Democratic sweep would likely result in more spending and may drive yields higher. Municipal debt could gain under Clinton because any increased taxes she imposes on the wealthy would make tax-free bonds more attractive, BlackRock said. Trump Wins: In the two weeks after the U.K. gobsmacked pollsters and voted to leave the EU on June 23, the U.S. benchmark 10-year yield fell 39 basis points and didn’t return to pre-Brexit levels until September. Something akin to that may happen if Trump defies conventional wisdom. Credit Agricole SA predicts a “massive disjoint” that would send 10-year yields down at least 10 basis points if he prevails. Lyngen’s survey average predicted a smaller drop. JPMorgan’s Normand said the yield would fall below 1.7 percent in the days after a Trump win, from 1.83 percent on Monday. After the dust settles, Trump’s tax cuts and infrastructure-spending plans may drive yields back up, especially if Republicans hold both the House and Senate. That impact could be exaggerated if the Republican’s isolationist foreign policy prompts countries with large Treasury stakes to unload them, Credit Agricole analysts said. Fiscal largess would also benefit inflation-linked bonds, which already are outperforming nominal securities this year. Yields would only remain flat under Trump, according to Bank of America, in the unlikeliest event of all: President Trump finds himself up against Democrats controlling both houses of Congress, because they would resist his massive tax cuts. Trump’s support for fossil fuels could spur a rebound for energy industry bonds, especially high-yield ones, after two years of major losses in the commodities slump, Wells Fargo & Co. said in a report. As for munis, “Trump’s plan to slash personal tax rates could deal a blow to the asset class,” BlackRock’s report said. Currencies Clinton Wins: The U.S. dollar would gain versus other developed-market currencies, with the Democrat heading toward the White House as traders focus attention on the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will raise rates in December, according to Capital Economics, a London research firm. Down the road, Bank of America sees the greenback gaining under Clinton only if the Democrats take Congress. Emerging-market currencies would see “modest and transitory” gains because a Clinton win “is mostly -- but not fully -- priced in,” though Russia may be an exception, Societe Generale said. Mexico’s peso would benefit the most, the report said. Citigroup told its clients that there might not be major peso gains if Clinton wins. The currency has acted as a barometer of the presidential contest, moving in tandem with her chances of defeating a candidate who wants to revamp trade deals, restrict immigration and make the U.S.’s southern neighbor pay for a border wall. If Clinton triumphs, the peso will strengthen to 18.25 per dollar, a 1.7 percent gain from Monday, and the Canadian dollar would also rise, Normand of JPMorgan said before the latest FBI news. Elsewhere, most Asian currencies would rally 2 percent or so in relief, said Cliff Tan, a strategist in Hong Kong for Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. Trump Wins: The foreign-exchange markets this month suggested what might happen if the Republican triumphs, with the dollar tumbling against most major currencies and the Mexican peso plunging before Monday’s recovery on the FBI’s announcement about Clinton’s e-mails. Societe Generale sees Mexico’s currency at 23 per dollar after a win by the Republican, 19 percent weaker than Monday, while Bank of America said traders already “have gone a long way toward pricing in a surprise Trump victory.” JPMorgan’s Normand predicted one-day slides of 8 percent for the peso and 5 percent for the Canadian dollar -- based on a President Trump’s power to impose protectionist measures unilaterally. The currencies of the U.S.’s neighbors would then recover some, he said, with Mexico’s central bank intervening to defend the peso and Congress moving to restrain Trump’s trade policies. Actions by Mexican authorities “will be seen as inevitable,” said George Lei, a Bloomberg currency strategist. Other developed-market currencies including the yen, euro, pound and franc may also gain on concern that China would dump U.S. assets and the Fed would delay tightening monetary policy, analysts said. Normand sees the yen gaining 3 percent. Societe Generale sees it strengthening to 99 per dollar, 5.6 percent more than Monday. Commodity-linked currencies including the Canadian dollar also “would lose ground,” BMO said. The greenback could then rally in a three- to nine-month horizon as Republicans usher in tax cuts and other fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth, Bank of America said. The candidate’s hostility toward China -- including threats of steep tariffs over alleged currency manipulation -- likely would drive the offshore yuan down about 3 percent by year’s end, said Ken Cheung, a foreign-exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank Ltd. in Hong Kong. Longer term, the currency may fall more gradually under Trump as he exerts political pressure on the country’s leaders to slow its depreciation, said Xu Gao, an economist at Everbright Securities Co. in Beijing. Risk aversion in the aftermath of a Trump win would also push down other developing-world currencies on fears that his protectionist stances could hurt emerging economies by reducing imports from them. That “could be negative for high-yielder countries,” Credit Agricole said in a report. The South Korean won may take a hit, given questions that Trump has raised about the need for U.S. troops on the North Korean border. “Downward pressure on EM FX is likely to be sustained for quite some time” with a Trump win, Societe Generale said in a report Monday, citing the Turkish lira and Taiwanese dollar as among those at risk. Russia’s ruble “would benefit the most from Trump’s alleged pandering” to the regime of Vladimir Putin. If Republicans sweep, the euro might fall against the dollar, BMO said, because they would be inclined to open a foreign-earnings repatriation window for American companies to bring money back home, and “a high concentration of U.S.-based multinationals’ earnings are held” in Europe. Emerging Markets Clinton Wins: It’ll be risk-on if the Democrat retains control of the White House, which bodes well for developing markets. Investors may respond by bidding up Chinese defense shares because Clinton comes across as the more hawkish candidate, said Francis Cheung, head of China and Hong Kong strategy at CLSA Ltd. Commodity producers in the developing world might rally on expectations that U.S. demand will increase along with infrastructure spending. Trump Wins: “I can’t think of any country that would benefit if Trump wins,” CMC Markets’ Yang said. Evercore’s report mentioned one nation that might get a boost, suggesting investors buy Russian equities to hedge against the Clinton-leaning polls being wrong. Nadia Kazakova, a Russian oil and gas specialist for Saxo Group, said she’s not convinced the country would benefit economically from Trump. If he wins, the global shock “could strike Russian markets much harder than others” due to risk aversion and falling commodities. “And as Trump makes America great again, would he still have the heart for a great deal with not-so-great Russia?” she wrote in a report. Citigroup sees the MSCI Emerging Markets Index immediately falling at least 10 percent, with Mexican stocks leading the way down. The Institute for International Finance explained why in a report on Thursday: “Nearly 80% of Mexico’s exports go to the U.S.,” and “workers’ remittances are one of the three largest sources of foreign currency,” behind oil and tourism. One possible bright spot for Mexico: Construction companies such as Cemex SAB de CV may be positioned for contracts to build Trump’s proposed border wall. In Asia, “China will bear the brunt of risks if Trump wins,” said Ken Peng, an investment strategist at Citi Private Bank in Hong Kong, by phone. “He’ll probably introduce trade policies targeted against China,” weakening its economy. Protectionist U.S. policies also would be “bad for a lot of economies that rely a lot on exports,” said Ben Bei, an analyst at CIMB Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. Peng said exporters from South Korea and Taiwan are among those with the most to lose. Yang adds Southeast Asia exporters to the list, including companies in Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Philippines, Malaysia and Vietnam. Citigroup called Latin America “most vulnerable” to U.S. protectionism. To the extent that Trump is less welcoming to workers from abroad, his victory may hurt the Philippines’ broader economy, which gets the bulk of its overseas remittances from Filipinos employed in the U.S., Yang said. Capital Economics put that country, followed by Taiwan and South Korea, as the Asian countries "with the most to lose" from Trump. “India and Indonesia will be least affected if Trump wins,” due to their robust domestic growth, Peng said. Pakistan should also be “relatively unaffected,” Capital Economics said. Commodities Clinton Wins: Her environmental policies, especially her promise to combat climate change, will put pressure on coal and oil. The natural gas market could get a boost from her pledge to wean power plants off coal by using gas as “a bridge” to more reliance on renewables. Trump Wins: Natural gas prices likely would suffer as coal benefits under Trump. He has promised to roll back environmental rules that squeeze coal out of the U.S. power market and promoted “clean coal” during one of the debates. Bloomberg Intelligence in September estimated that a victory by the Republican would shave 11 percent off natural gas demand in 2030 from last year’s levels, boosting coal use. Oil prices could get a lift from the return of a risk premium if Trump continues with the “bellicose language that’s been heard on the campaign trail” about Iran and scraps President Barack Obama’s nuclear deal with the country, said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, a New York hedge fund focused on energy. JPMorgan’s Normand sees Brent crude oil rising to $54 a barrel by year’s end, a 17 percent gain from Monday, but not before falling 5 percent or so initially “in sympathy with equities, much as occurred after Brexit.” Gold, platinum and silver would the “biggest winners” if Trump wins, said Yang, the CMC Markets analyst. After the FBI’s surprise announcement about the Clinton e-mail inquiry on Oct. 28, all precious metals rose before giving back much of those gains on Monday. Normand sees gold immediately rising to $1,350 an ounce if Trump wins, about 5 percent higher than Monday, before retreating in the next month to $1,225. Copper may also get a bounce, Barclays said, citing moves in the metal’s price during the campaign suggesting “a Trump-related premium” based on his plans to boost spending on bridges, roads and the like. Normand disagrees, calling Trump’s “gargantuan infrastructure ambitions” too vague and unrealistic to support base-metal prices for long. Given the danger his trade agenda poses to Asian growth, he sees copper immediately falling 3 percent if Trump wins. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The market rallied simply because it loves certainty. "I long for the market to be, well, the market again, where we value companies on how well they are doing, not as a part of a vast basket that goes up or down depending on how certain we are about the results of the election," the "Mad Money" host said. But if Clinton does declare victory, then Cramer expects the market to go back to normal the day after the election. That means Cramer's got his eye on the companies with the best earnings that can take investors through year end. The banks were the best winners of earnings season, as they generated bigger profits than anyone expected. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and KeyCorp all blew Cramer away. Of the soft financials, Cramer was most impressed with Visa, MasterCard and American Express. The second group that performed well was the social, mobile and cloud stocks like Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon and Accenture. Transports were also a puzzling winner, as most railroads and airlines didn't make the numbers, but will likely do much better next year. Cramer liked United Continental and Norfolk Southern as comeback options. Carlo Allegri | Reuters Donald Trump reacts during a campaign event in Selma, North Carolina, November 3, 2016. Even though polls for the election currently favor a victory for Hillary Clinton on Tuesday, Cramer has seen the polls wrong before. That is why he prepared investors for what to expect in the event that Donald Trump wins the presidential race. The one stance that stood out to Cramer from Trump's platform was his stance on Mexico. If he wins, Trump plans to build a wall along the border and attempt to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Cracking down on Mexican exports would likely boost American manufacturing jobs, but it could also make products more expensive for U.S. consumers. This means a company like Cemex — a Mexican company that is one of the world's largest manufacturers of cement and concrete — could be hurt substantially under a Trump presidency. Another stock that could be impacted negatively by a Trump regime is Kansas City Southern, the main railroad that connects Mexico to the U.S. A large wall could hinder the very transportation routes that Kansas City Southern relies on. As stocks bounced back on Monday, Cramer watched asinvestors crowded back into the trusted FANG stocks. FANG stands for Cramer's acronym for the growth stocks leading the market: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now Alphabet. "In my 35 years of picking stocks, I have always found this phenomenon to be the case: the favorite growth stocks stay favorites until they stop growing," Cramer said. Two of the four FANG names issued guidance that investors found disappointing when they reported. One surprised Wall Street with decent earnings and OK revenue growth, but no forecast boost. The final name simply did what was expected. Yet, all four were the first stocks investors reached for on Monday.

Cramer suspected that its latest acquisitions could be paying off for the company, and Wall Street is finally taking notice to its stock. XPO is a provider of transportation and logistics services. Just over a year ago, it bought trucking firm Con-way for $3 billion just after it acquired European transportation play Norbert Dentressangle, for $3.5 billion in 2015. Cramer spoke with XPO Logistics' CEO Brad Jacobs on Monday, who confirmed that the plan for the company all along has been to become the brokerage and delivery company that customers have been waiting for. "The plan has been to stake out positions in the fastest growing parts of transportation and logistics, and be either No. 1 or close to No. 1," Jacobs said. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few caller favorite stocks: First Solar: "On that conference call, you heard that they pushed back the billion dollar's worth of business. They pushed back a billion dollars! There was no way you could get behind that stock. Absolutely not! That was a very bad call." Hortonworks: "I think they missed the quarter bad. I think people don't really care for them. But you know what? It's down so low I don't think it's such a bad buy. I would speculate on it."
