U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan rejected a bid by Anthony Murgio to dismiss two charges related to his alleged operation of Coin.mx, which prosecutors have called an unlicensed bitcoin exchange. Murgio had argued that bitcoin did not qualify as "funds" under the federal law prohibiting the operation of unlicensed money transmitting businesses. But the judge, like her colleague Jed Rakoff in an unrelated 2014 case, said the virtual currency met that definition. "Bitcoins are funds within the plain meaning of that term," Nathan wrote. "Bitcoins can be accepted as a payment for goods and services or bought directly from an exchange with a bank account. They therefore function as pecuniary resources and are used as a medium of exchange and a means of payment." The decision did not address six other criminal counts that Murgio faces, Nathan wrote. Lawyers for Murgio did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Prosecutors last year charged Murgio over the operation of Coin.mx, and in April charged his father Michael with participating in bribery aimed at supporting it. Authorities have said Coin.mx was owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli man who, along with two others, was charged with running a sprawling computer hacking and fraud scheme targeting a dozen companies, including JPMorgan, and exposing personal data of more than 100 million people. That alleged scheme generated hundreds of millions of dollars of profit through pumping up stock prices, online casinos, money laundering and other illegal activity, prosecutors have said. Shalon has pleaded not guilty, and is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. He hired new lawyers last month and is seeking permission to replace lawyers who joined the case in June, a Monday court filing showed. The case is U.S. v Murgio et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00769.

RAN research shows that these sponsors, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Bank of the West (BNP Paribas)  are helping drive the climate crisis by pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into extreme fossil fuels. Extreme fossil fuels are the most carbon intensive, financially risky, and environmentally destructive subsectors of the fossil fuel industry and include coal power, coal mining, liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals, and extreme oil (tar sands, Arctic oil, and ultra-deepwater drilling). Rainforest Action Network’s 2016 report, Shorting the Climate, reveals that between 2013 and 2015, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and BNP Paribas (parent company of Bank of the West) banks put $9.89 billion into coal mining companies, $30.7 billion into the largest coal power producers, $74.91 billion into companies building LNG export terminals in North America, and $77.3 billion into companies exposed to extreme oil.  Amanda Starbuck, RAN Climate and Energy Program Director, said: “To meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and BNP Paribas must stop funding extreme fossil fuels, which are simply incompatible with a climate-stable world. Given their current investments in climate-wrecking activities, their sponsorship of ‘Climate Week NYC’ amounts to little more than greenwashing. If these banks aspire to be climate leaders,  they must accelerate their exit from coal, and commit to getting out of extreme oil and fracked-gas terminals as well.” The Shorting the Climate report, released this past June, also showed that leading financial institutions’ business-as-usual investment in fossil fuels stands in direct contradiction to the global consensus to limit global warming.  Between 2013 and 2015, 25 major global banks  sank $42 billion in companies active in coal mining; $154 billion for the 20 largest coal-fired power producers; $306 billion for companies that drill extreme oil; and $282 billion for companies building LNG export infrastructure.  Among the 25 major global banks analyzed in Shorting the Climate, JPMorgan Chase was the #1 investor in two extreme fossil fuel subsectors: LNG export terminals and extreme oil. The report does reflect bank movement on coal mining, where nine of the biggest U.S. and European banks committed to reduce funding for the coal mining sector since 2015.  Based on their ability to quickly switch their stance on coal over the last year alone, banks are capable of making the critical choice to cut out extreme fossil fuel investments. Not only can they do it, but it is a critical step to follow through on promises made in Paris to stabilize the climate.

JP Morgan CEO to talk poverty in Cincinnati Fatima Hussein , fhussein@enquirer.com 4:56 p.m. EDT September 19, 2016 JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon (Photo: Kimberly White, Getty Images for Fortune) Jamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of the largest bank in the U.S., will speak about combating poverty this week in Cincinnati. Dimon, who has been chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co. since 2005, will be the keynote speaker at the Cincinnati Works 20th anniversary luncheon at Xavier University's Cintas Center on Wednesday. Founded in 1996 by Dave and Liane Phillips, Cincinnati Works helps job seekers below the federal poverty guidelines find employment and work toward economic self-sufficiency. The theme of the anniversary event is drawing connections between poverty and Cincinnati's economy. Dimon is vocal about the need to address poverty through wage increases and other methods traditionally shunned by the business community. The JPMorgan Chase Foundation has also contributed more than $500,000 to Cincinnati Works since 2008. Last July, Dimon wrote in an opinion piece for the New York Times, that JPMorgan would raise its minimum wage for 18,000 U.S. employees from $10.15 an hour (plus benefits) to between $12 and $16.50 per hour over the next three years. Raises will depend on geographic and market factors. "A pay increase is the right thing to do," he wrote in the article dated July 12. "Wages for many Americans have gone nowhere for too long. Many employees who will receive this increase work as bank tellers and customer service representatives. Above all, it enables more people to begin to share in the rewards of economic growth," Dimon wrote. Chase is the sixth largest bank in the Cincinnati region, with local deposits of $1.9 billion and a 2.1 percent market share, according to FDIC data. In Cincinnati, he will speak about wage inequality and skills development, the state of American business. He also will share his thoughts on leadership and problem solving, according to Jeff Lyttle, his New York-based spokesman. In the past, Dimon has stated he would like to see more income tax credits for more workers, which would lessen the tax burden on the working class. He has also voiced support in the past for legalizing undocumented immigrants in the U.S., reforming urban schools, higher infrastructure spending, and lower corporate taxes. Eric Cepela, a spokesman for Cincinnati Works, said that "JPMorgan Chase is active in the fight against poverty and is a major supporter of Cincinnati Works." Dimon "is not only able to provide insight into the issue but also has the notoriety to help us further catch the attention of Cincinnati and its leaders," Cepela said in an email. Cincinnati consistently ranks as having one of the highest poverty rates in the nation. "Despite these statistics, there is opportunity in Cincinnati – it is a matter of assisting individuals to take advantage of and benefit from that opportunity," Cepela said. Also slated to speak at the event are John Barrett, CEO, president, and chairman of Western & Southern Financial Group; and Dave Herche, CEO of Enerfab and chairman of Cincinnati Works. The event will also include the release of a study conducted by University of Cincinnati's Economics Center regarding the economic impact of Cincinnati Works on the city of Cincinnati. 79 CONNECTTWEET 93 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2cynvey TOP VIDEOS Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 Predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59 Crime lab: No evidence on Tensing’s boots that he was dragged 4:07 Alternate juror in Ray Tensing trial has been dismissed 1:24 Born in Cincinnati, celebrated around the world: An anthem that unites us 3:39 Inside Prep Sports 360: Colerain Football prepares for playoffs 5:05 JP Macura looks ahead to the season 2:24

The US is facing a more uncertain time with the Presidential election looming Credit: AP Photo/Richard Drew Laura Suter 19 September 2016 • 8:24am British investors who want exposure to the American stock market mainly use “passive” investments, which simply track the overall market. But with a high-profile presidential election and a much-debated decision over interest rates coming up, more market volatility is looming. Does this mean it’s time to turn to the skills of an active fund manager? A climate of fear in US markets The US market has risen steadily since the financial crisis, but as well as the next interest rate rise and the election campaign there is a potential slowdown in growth to worry about. Alex Dryden, a market analyst at JP Morgan Asset Management, the investment house, said the US was facing growth challenges as productivity in the country had failed to pick up. Regardless of the outcome of the presidential election, he said, the biggest risk to markets was the US reaching its federal “debt ceiling” – the maximum amount it can borrow – in March next year. With that uncertainty comes a likely increase in the amount the market rises and falls. In the past week there has been a spike in volatility in US markets after a number of American officials spoke about the likelihood of rising interest rates at this week’s meeting of the Federal Reserve, causing investors to get scared and sell shares. I think markets are priced for a Clinton president and a Trump presidency is seen as an unknown, so that for me is quite a lot of uncertaintyAlex Dryden, JP Morgan Asset Management An index called the “Vix” that attempts to measure the volatility of America’s broadly based S&P 500 index jumped to its highest level since the Brexit vote, from near a one-year low of 11.9 to 18.4. It hit 25.8 the day after the Brexit vote. One factor behind this volatility is uncertainly over the outcome of the US presidential election, which hit the headlines last week following Hillary Clinton’s bout of ill health. Mr Dryden said: “I think markets are priced for a Clinton president and a Trump presidency is seen as an unknown, so that for me is quite a lot of uncertainty. If Trump becomes president, we could see a similar situation as with Brexit, where markets fell off in an emotional reaction while they were processing the news.”  However, just as with Brexit, this initial panic would subside when people realised that Trump would find it difficult to put his policies into practice, he said. Donald Trump winning the US election may not have as big impact on markets as many expect Credit: EPA There is also the uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve will increase interest rates. Some suspect the rise could come at a meeting of the “Fed” this week, while others think officials will wait until the election has passed and move rates up in December. The case for active fund management These uncertain times are exactly when active managers would argue that their skill and ability to select particular stocks should beat the market, enabling them to profit from any rises but dodge most of the market falls. Passive funds, by contrast, will reflect all the ups and downs of the market. “The recent flap caused when Fed officials hinted that interest rates might go up more quickly than the market expected saw a very wide divergence of reactions in the markets,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, the fund shop. “There has been a very wide range of sector performance. That is potentially when active managers can get ahead of the crowd and target sectors that were unloved, and not follow the herd.” 30 years of bear markets - history tells us what's next Newton Global Income fund focus: 'The US stock market is expensive - but it's China that worries me' A chance to buy into US investing guru Gabelli at a discount US fund managers admit that passive funds are their biggest competition. Nick Ford, manager of the Miton US Opportunities fund, said he was trying to win over investors who were invested in passives rather than assets from other active managers. “Any active manager would argue the case that now is the time to go active very powerfully,” said Mr Mould. “If the market goes down, passives will follow it down, while fund managers will argue they would do a better job of protecting you from falls.” Mr Mould gave the example of the Fidelity American Special Situations fund as an active fund that had far outperformed the index. It has returned 166.9pc over five years, compared with the 138.8pc return of the S&P 500 index. “The fund has done a fantastic job,” he said. “It invests in a select number of stocks and draws a line in the sand at what is good value and what is not. That technique has worked tremendously well for a consistent period.” The manager, Angel Agudo, said he was already seeing opportunities in the market. “The recent bout of volatility has created numerous interesting stockpicking opportunities,” he said. In particular, he has more money in the technology, industrial and health care sectors. Active vs Passive in US equities However, such front-runners aside, the average figures across all funds do not make for pretty reading. Just 16 of 95 active US equity funds have beaten the market after fees over a five-year period. Over three years, just 16 funds out of 78 beat the market, according to FE Trustnet, the data provider. The average US active fund has delivered a 54.8pc return over the past three years, compared with 63.6pc for passive funds. Over five years the difference is even more stark, with active funds delivering 15.8 percentage points less than passive funds. They were also more volatile than passive funds. Fees could be a large factor in the performance gap. The average US passive equity fund costs 0.24pc a year, compared with 1.14pc for active funds. Within the passive sector there are some rock-bottom prices, such as the 0.07pc cost of Vanguard’s S&P 500 ETF and iShares’ Core S&P 500 ETF offering. Darius McDermott, managing director of Chelsea Financial Services, the fund shop, said: “I am totally supportive of active management, but the only market I can think of where I would ever advise a tracker is in US large caps, as it is too difficult to beat the S&P consistently.” He said active managers could beat the index but only over the long term, 10 years or more, which was too long for most investors. Want to go active? Charles Younes, research manager at FE Trustnet, said that while more volatile markets might provide more opportunities for active managers, being able to predict the outcome of big political events was a tricky task. “It is really hard to time a political agenda. Some UK equity managers tried to do it this year with the Brexit vote and it took three months for them to recover their losses,” he said. “Maybe some US active managers will try to do that, but I don’t think they have any edge in predicting the outcome of the US election. I don’t think anyone has any edge in that because nobody knows what is going to happen.” Even if Trump wins, his ability to make radical decisions will be limited, experts have said, which should limit the effect on markets. “I don’t think [a Trump victory] will have a huge impact on the market,” said Mr Younes. “Trump maybe is very strange, but he is surrounded by a team and they won’t make stupid decisions.” 'Telegraph 25': the definitive list of our favourite investment funds Follow The Telegraph READ MORE ABOUT: JP Morgan US Election Funds USA Fidelity Hillary Clinton US Federal Reserve Show more Money latest 18 Nov 2016, 5:04pm House prices in George Osborne's neighbourhood fall - a victim of his changes to stamp duty 18 Nov 2016, 3:41pm Leasehold scandal: ground rent that starts at £250, then rockets to ... £69 trillion 18 Nov 2016, 3:40pm Comment: For the first time since I began to invest in any serious way, I have sold a significant chunk of my portfolio  Richard Evans Premium 18 Nov 2016, 2:42pm Comment: 'How I positioned my £1.6bn portfolio for higher inflation' Marcus Brookes Premium 18 Nov 2016, 12:51pm Analysis: how the Government destroyed buy-to-let in 16 months Premium 18 Nov 2016, 11:21am 'Should you break out of fixed-rate cash Isas?' 18 Nov 2016, 8:27am Questor: Buy-to-let isn't dead, so invest in this niche lender Premium 18 Nov 2016, 8:21am Hargreaves Lansdown to launch low-cost UK fund 18 Nov 2016, 8:12am Inflation is rising: where should you put your money? 18 Nov 2016, 8:03am 'Can I transfer an Isa on death without penalty?' 18 Nov 2016, 6:30am From Pink Floyd to penthouses: the history of Battersea Power Station's famous chimneys Premium 18 Nov 2016, 6:00am Property Doctors: the vendor wrecked our new home after the survey was done Premium 17 Nov 2016, 5:12pm Spains Hall, owned by just three families since 1066, is up for sale 17 Nov 2016, 1:50pm Comment: Buy-to-let landlords like me feel completely let down by this government Phil Stewardson 17 Nov 2016, 12:00pm Top property manager: 'The London market will fall.

We covered 20 Indian companies in terms of research and we had 100 employees," he says. Jamie Dimon as the chairman of JPMorgan is probably the only Wall Street chief to have weathered the Global Financial Crisis and guided his bank to the top rank. He doesn't mince words, be it the Fed's stance on interest rates, or policy makers who come up with strict rules that curb businesses. In an interview with ET, Dimon speaks his mind on issues ranging from the US elections to interest rates to China to the Indian economy. Edited excerpts: Has India's image changed after Narendra Modi became Prime Minister? I think so, and for the positive. You are the fastestgrowing country on the planet today and you are making changes. Politics is hard, but he is a successful and a strong leader and your foreign direct investment has doubled in the last four-five years. India is a bright spot, but some would say that there is excessive self-congratulation. What is your view? India is definitely a bright spot, it's not overdone. It is growing at 7%-plus, the deficit has gone down quite a bit, and the government has made changes which are conducive to future growth. All countries have economic cycles but it is quite a positive sign. I am not interested when people refer to a quarter or this year because the way I look at a country is what are its prospects over the next 20-30 years, and India's are good. What convinced you about India's promise? My first trip to India with JP Morgan was in 2004-05 when we were a smaller company. We covered 20 Indian companies in terms of research and we had 100 employees. Now we provide research on 120 companies and we distribute this globally. We continue to invest in our business here; and in the future, we will have 30,000 people in JP Morgan's Global Service Centre, which supports the firm globally in areas such as technology, security, programming and research. The GSC covers a whole gamut of services and it's still growing. What about the Indian economy itself? What you should also keep in mind is that you have a lot of successful companies in India. What makes these companies stand out is that they grew independently and weren't championed by the government.They grew because they are good at what they do in terms of offering their services around the world. If you compare this to other markets and countries, it took a lot of government support to have the companies they have now. ALSO READ: Not an exaggeration to call India sole bright spot: JPMorgan Chairman Jamie Dimon A lot of foreign banks in India are shrinking, but you are one of the few to have opened new branches... We always take a long-term view on each market. We are not a fair-weather friend.We are here during the good times and the bad times and we want the Indian people and the Indian government to say that they are better off with JP Morgan being here and that they view JP Morgan as a consistent friend. There have been ups and downs since I have been coming here, but I don't worry about those ups and downs because we have our eye on the long term. We grow with countries as they grow and with companies as they grow. Our lending here is $2 billion and we have an asset-management arm investing $9 billion in India across asset classes and this will double or even triple over the next 15-20 years. With regard to government and Reserve Bank of India policies on foreign banks, are there issues to be addressed? It took us a long time to get our new branches, so I applaud Kalpana Morparia, our CEO for India. I think foreign investors should be able to hold more than 4.99% of an Indian bank. However, since JP Morgan is not moving into the retail business in India it's not a huge complaint. For the most part JP Morgan doesn't feel a lot of restrictions as it conducts business here. If you had an opportunity to buy a large Indian private sector bank, which one would that be? Remember our retail business is only in the US and it's very, very hard to compete in a business like retail in any other country. I couldn't open 100 branches here and be good at it. Local companies like ICICI Bank would eat us for breakfast just like it would be very hard for them to open retail over there. We are instead focused on the institutional business and helping large companies and governments.We help bank countries and companies around the world. For example, we just raised $3 billion in the sovereign bond market in a single day. How do you look at the political leadership in various countries you invest vis-a-vis India? India as you know has a very complicated political system. Ten years ago the thought that a Prime Minister would get a simple majority was beyond imagination.But I don't want to just compare India with other emerging market countries -look at Italy, they have had 50-60 Prime Ministers in the last 60 years. These things occur when democracies are set up. In America, we have a two-party system and the American constitution is a piece of brilliance but they did not know when they set it up we would just have a twoparty system. It just so happens that our electorate pushed towards the two-party system because it's a very good way to govern. If you have too many parties, it is very hard to achieve things that need to get done with regards to education, roads, hospitals and businesses. Politics is very hard in many different countries. You are among the few from the world of finance who wants the Fed to raise interest rates. The markets warn against such a move. Why? The market doesn't say anything. The market is just a bunch of people buying and selling every single day and countries don't have to have the same interest rates. If America is growing and America's unemployment is low, then it should have a monetary policy that is good for America; and if America is growing that's good for you too. Whether rates are 3% or 1%, growing should be more important to you than our interest rates. But interest rate movements affect financial markets... The normalization of interest rates is a good thing, but 25 basis points in itself is irrelevant and everyone knows it. In the old days, rates going up was considered tightening, and when they tightened they took money out of the system. Today, they are just raising rates by dictating returns on reserves so I am not sure it's quite the same thing as tightening. They are not actually taking money out of the system. I think the riskier thing is using extraordinary monetary policy when you in fact don't need it. America has 4.9% unemployment, we have added 15 million jobs since the Great Recession. Household wages are going up, it's seen a 5% leap. We have a lot of good news and I don't see these potholes that will derail America. I don't think it would have mattered that much if they had raised the rates in September. I would have raised it. What's your view on negative interest rates? I personally don't like them and I am not sure they are going to work. It doesn't seem as if it has worked. Some very smart people think it has worked a little bit but it's like pushing string at its point. If you are a company, I cannot make you spend more money because rates are lower. I don't know of any business that has said they are going to build a new plant because rates are low. And savers have to save more money. I am not sure consumers spend more if you have low rates. You know this phenomenon in airplanes that the air flows one way and when it goes to high speed it flows the other way -that might be monetary policy.So I am not sure if zero works. You have said you won't buy 10-year US treasuries... I wouldn't and I have been right since I have said that. So is that an indication of a bubble in this asset class? I am always very careful. I look at probabilities. I think there is a high probability of people saying it's too low. Again we have added 15 million jobs, wages are going up, inflation is going up, there are no potholes and housing is in short supply. If you look at the buyers of 10-year bonds since QE (quantitative easing) started - it's the US government, the Chinese government, other governments, US banks, because there is a change in regulatory policy, and the so-called risk-off buyers who get scared and jump into 10-year. The first three have disappeared already. But when things get good, eventually there won't be people who are going to jump into a 10-year as a risk haven. The US treasury curve is not a real market unlike the credit curve of the world where you freely buy and sell and I think there is a quite high probability that it will go up more than what people think and it will be more volatile than what people think. If someone Googles you, the first thing that pops up is your statement that you would like to be President. I would love to be the President of United States and I think I would be good at it but it's too late and it is too hard. You are younger than both Hillary and Trump by a long shot.. . OK yes, but most of these people have been in politics their whole life. They have come up through their respective parties and they have got the support of their parties. Michael Bloomberg would have been a fabulous President but he thought he wouldn't get the Democrats or the Republicans to support him and he didn't want to run as an independent because you can't win as an independent. So, yes I would have loved it but it's too late. But what is more important is that whoever is President, if they do right things America will boom. And which one would you prefer of the two? I can't comment on that and I have no interest in whether they call themselves Democrat or Republican, but it's important that they do the right things. We get into this debate in America that Democrats want infrastructure to create jobs. In some respects they are right we need better infrastructure. You have a new airport in Delhi and if you go to some of our airports you will find that they are surprisingly bad. But the Republicans are also right in the idea that they don't want to tax Americans more, have that money go to Washington and watch it being misspent. There are examples where building a hospital costs $2 billion when the government does it, but would cost $350 million if a private enterprise does the same. They are both right. We need good infrastructure with property built and delivered on time at the right price. We should have more tunnels and bridges for example. If you see New York City, the traffic is similar to Delhi. I don't think we have built a tunnel or a new bridge in 50 years. Infrastructure should be planned out for the long term, yet it gets bogged down in politics. What about human resources, talent and immigration? We need immigration reform in the United States that is respectful to the people who have earned the right to become citizens. We need better education because it creates more jobs especially when it's done in partnership with local business. Germany is a good example, where 95% of the kids who go to a vocational school walk out with a job because their training was in conjunction with some local business.The companies say they will help train the students and they get a job. What about the resistance to open trade and taxation issues? We need to reform our corporate tax.It's a disaster. And we really need to get the TPP (Trans Pacific Partnership) done. All these things are great for Americans but somehow the political debate is made to reflect that they are bad. I know that some people get hurt by trade but there are ways to fix that.We call for trade assistance, which is if you can demonstrate you were hurt by trade then we will help you find another job. Trade is very good for the country, it's very good for the GDP, it's good for wages but it doesn't mean it's always good for every business. So we should have trade assistance, which is about relocation, re-education and training. But the classical model that trade is good, more openness is good, seems to be under threat... It's under threat because we have failed to educate a lot of people about the benefits and we have failed to acknowledge the negatives. I would say it's been great for the world. It has lifted 2 billion people out of poverty and in the next 20 years it's going to be another 2 billion people. So don't tell me it's bad for the world. Does that mean it was good for everyone in America? No it was not. That's why I go back to trade assistance. And there's a raging debate about rising income inequality... I think it is also true that wages haven't been going up enough for people in the lower paid jobs. And there is less certainty around their jobs and we should do something about that. Now you can blame me as the CEO of a big bank but that's not going to fix the problem --we help grow economies.What will fix the problems are the right policies that will introduce training, jobs and relocation. I always tell the Republicans that they should start their conversation by saying that we are going to take care of our sick, our old and our poor. We just want to do it intelligently. We need a better conversation and hopefully that will happen. The opinion on China ranges from extraordinarily bullish to the opposite.What's your view? China has done an extraordinary job with their country. The leadership is very bright, they acknowledge issues such as corruption, their inefficient state-owned enterprises, the need for market reforms, the need to build more technology. They make a lot of right moves in order to lift their people. It will be OK. You spoke about how JP Morgan uses technology to offer better services and also how it has become a mini police state. Can you explain? Ok so these are two different things.We are the largest bank in the United States of America and of course we use technology to move money around the world. Why I referred to a police station was about internal controls and cyber security. The only way you can combat cyber security is to use very strict hardline rules about the production of software, the testing of software, and who has access to your systems, the monitoring of everything that takes place out there. So we monitor everything internally. If things go wrong, we close it down. So what keeps you awake at night? Cyber security is one of them. We spend approximately $600 million on cyber security every year. Stay on top of business news with The Economic Times App. Download it Now!

Global fund managers are urging caution. Since Aug. 1, seven issuers opened order books for their Basel III bond sales in Asian hours, raising $11.9 billion selling instruments that count as capital under Basel III rules. HSBC Holdings Plc separately issued $2 billion of total loss-absorbing capacity notes in Taiwan. In the first seven months, only three such deals opened in Asia. Asia’s high net-worth individuals, whose wealth has surpassed counterparts in North America, have been major investors in regional bank bonds, slashing yields. They are turning to Europe even as a rout in shares of lenders including Deutsche Bank AG worsens. Hybrid issues with low, fixed coupons face downside risk from rising U.S. Treasury yields, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. “Asian investors tend to be more yield hungry and willing to take higher risks," said Ben Sy, the head of fixed income, currencies and commodities at the private banking arm of JPMorgan in Hong Kong. While they tend to focus on European banks with strong retail franchises, they "are getting complacent" when it comes to insurer bonds, he said. German insurer Allianz SE sold $1.5 billion of Tier 2 perpetual notes in August to yield 3.875 percent with the coupon fixed for life. Commerzbank AG says the higher returns promised by European banks come with greater risk amid low lending margins. Additional Tier 1 notes sold by European issuers in 2016 pay an average coupon of 6.6 percent, compared with 3.9 percent for Asia, Bloomberg-compiled data show. London-based Standard Chartered Plc sold $2 billion AT1 notes to yield 7.5 percent last month, with 31 percent going to Asian investors. Zurich-based UBS Group AG sold similar debt at 7.125 percent. By contrast, Singapore’s DBS Group Holdings Ltd. sold notes at 3.6 percent. “Asian bank debts are safer because governments may bail them out before AT1 investors suffer losses, while European governments are much less likely to do so,” said He Xuanlai, credit analyst at Commerzbank in Singapore. “I don’t think all investors buying into Europe hybrid bank bonds do extensive research.” Noah Holdings Ltd. said wealthy Chinese investors’ demand for overseas assets may grow as much as 20 percent next year as they diversify from a yuan that dropped 4.6 percent in the past year. Australian issuers such as Westpac Banking Corp. are also making Asian investors their first ports of call. Read: Asia Roars to Front of Line for Australian Greenback Bonds “This trend has just started and is targeting a broader range of investors, including private banks and wealth management funds, that are looking for yields,” said Clifford Lee, head of fixed income at DBS in Singapore. Deutsche Bank’s 7.5 percent AT1 notes dived to a record low 72 cents on Feb. 9, after it posted its first full-year loss since 2008. Its shares have tumbled 47 percent this year. “We really don’t like European banks,” said Donald Amstad, a director at Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Ltd. "The European Central Bank’s quantitative easing has caused bond yields to collapse. Banking in Europe, already an unprofitable business, is now under further pressure.” Profits for the 10 biggest European banks shrank 18 percent in the most-recent 12 months, compared with a 5.2 percent decline for the top 10 lenders in Asia excluding Japan. European banks sold $22.6 billion Basel III notes since August, up 43 percent from the year-earlier period. “If you are the treasurer of the bank, you need to find buyers of your debt and Asia is savings rich,” Amstad said. “But our approach to lending money to European banks is incredibly cautious.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Post Your Comments Share Cancel Bharat Iyer (more) Head - Research, JP Morgan | Capital Expertise: Equity - Fundamental Over the last six months, the government has put a lot of building blocks in place for a broad-based growth and focus will now be on implementation of these policies says Bharat Iyer, Head Of India Equity Research at JP Morgan. Iyer was sharing key takeaways of the JPMorgan Conference with CNBC-TV18. On a 2-year basis, Iyer believes companies in spaces related to urban consumption, roadways, power transmission, railways, defence and rural infrastructure will do well. He sees a bottoming-out trend in the capex cycle and feels meaningful improvement in capex is already visible in certain sectors like roads, power transmission and railways. Private sector may be a laggard in near- to mid-term with respect to capex, he says. On FMCG space he believes a lot of positives have already been factored in but there is a possibility of earnings surprise coming through. He also shared his view on the information technology space. Bharat Iyer, Head-India Equity Research, JPMorgan Below is the verbatim transcript of Bharat Iyer's interview with Latha Venkatesh, Sonia Shenoy and Anuj Singhal on CNBC-TV18. Latha: Let me start with the key takeaway you got from Arun Jaitley, you had Arun Jaitley and Nitin Gadkari at your conference as well as Arvind Subramanian among the policy makers, so from Jaitley what is the sense you get, would you just dive and buy all the goods and service tax (GST) stocks? A: A very positive outlook as far as the government. I think they clearly have done a lot. If you look at it in the last six months, the policy environment has been very positive. We perhaps had two of the most productive sessions of parliament; we have had the Aadhaar Bill passed, the Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) Regulation Bill passed, the Bankruptcy Code passed, the GST passed. So, going forward, we will see a lot of focus on implementation because that what remains to be done. Also, a lot of focus on the newer areas continuing with the cleanup of the banking system and ensuring that the banking system is in a good position to compliment gross domestic product (GDP) growth with credit growth as well as areas like labour, areas like rural infrastructure. So, broadly seeing that the building blocks for growth have been put in place and now it is time to go into the next phase. Sonia: When you interact with a lot of the investors, a lot of the companies, the ministers, what do you reckon could be a major or a mega trend from an equity market perspective for the next two to three years? If you had invested in IT stocks in 90s, that would have been a big trend, infrastructure was a big trend in 2003-2004. Over the next two to three years what do you see as a mega trend? A: I think it is going to be quite broad based. I don’t think it is going to be very narrow because as I said, growth has been an issue, both globally and locally. At least now what we are taking a lot of comfort from is that finally a lot of the building blocks for growth have been put in place, be it administrative, be it legislative or be it even from the central bank side. You have seen a cleanup of the banking system, at the same time the liquidity stance has changed from deficit to neutral, a lot of developments in terms of the corporate bond market. So, what we are seeing is that a lot of building blocks have been put which will lead to broad based economic growth. That said, obviously the sectors and segments that will do immediate term on a two year basis are where the government is putting a lot of focus. So, as we know, urban consumption should get a leg up because of the seventh pay commission’s recommendations being executed and it is not just going to be about the central government, down the line we will see the state governments, the state owned companies doing something similar and the private sector will perhaps have to keep pace. As far as the government is concerned, I think the priorities have been outlined for some time now, highways and roadways, the internal coastal network, the Sagar Mala project, power transmission, railways, defence, down the line perhaps more focus on rural infrastructure. So, I guess segments focusing on these areas should all do very well.   Anuj: Talking about consumption, all you overweight calls are on consumption whether it is autos, whether it is the staples, ITC , GSK,  Colgate or even oil marketing companies (OMCs) for that matter. However, these stocks have led the market now for two or three years, do you see these stocks again retaining that leadership position? A: All of these companies I think will benefit from compounding. What we are looking for if you ask me as a broad theme across the market is that this is a market trading at 18 times forward earnings. I am not saying this is too expensive and we can discuss valuations separately but expecting further valuation rerating here onwards at the broad market level is going to be a little difficult unless we see another surge in global liquidity. So, what you are really going to look for is those that can deliver in terms of earnings and who have good compounding stories over a two to three year basis or even a five year basis for that matter. So, our portfolio stance is largely centered around -- it is not so much sector specific, it is because even within every sector there are so many dynamics and so many nuances playing out that that easy differentiation you could have done within each sector, I think is largely over. You have to go after individual companies, look at their business strategies because there is disruption happening in virtually every sector. So, what you need to look out for is companies who have the management bandwidth and the competitive position to overcome that disruption and who can compound and that is a very strong thesis and that is a very strong place for us to invest in. Latha: You must have spoken to a bunch of corporates, 250 did you say corporate? A: Corporates we had about 75, investors were 250. Latha: What was the sense you got in terms of when will the capex start? We have been speaking about 70 percent capacity utilisation as a national average but there will always be areas where capital utilisation is higher, where do you see capex starting and when? A: In terms of the capex story, I think there has clearly been a bottoming out trend. We are already seeing a subtle uptrend in some cases, both on the consumption side and investment side. So, if you look at the investment side, are we seeing capex in roads very meaningfully? Yes. Have we seen very meaningful capex in power transmission? Yes. Do I see the data improving in the case of railways and defence in the next three to six months? Absolutely. Do I see rural infrastructure improving? Yes. The area that is going to be a little bit of a laggard is obviously going to be private sector because as you rightly pointed out utilisation levels in the economy are still at 70-75 percent and even assuming that the economy grows at 7-8 percent and these guys grow at 10 percent, they can afford to wait for a year or two before they start investing in a very meaningful manner. Let us also face it, some pockets still have distress because of very high leverage, some are facing a lot of competition from Chinese dumping, they look at the international environment around them. The way I look at it is, it’s a glass which you could define as half full or half empty. I would not say it is empty by no means. I think we have seen a pickup and in four to six quarters is when you really start seeing the glass go from half full to perhaps full. Latha: Your colleague James Sullivan was extremely impressed by the road trips that you took, your investors and he spoke about several FMCG companies saying that trucks will complete their journey from Rajasthan to Mumbai in 27 hours instead of three days, in one third of the time. Is all that factored in into FMCG prices or any company prices or is that the place where come GST we will still see upticks? A: The way I look at it, if you look at FMCG in particular, this is a segment that is trading at 35-40 times forward earnings. So, a lot of the expectations be it in terms of the positive demographics, be it in terms of the cyclical up tick because of pay commission, or good monsoon or because of GST, valuations do factor in a fair amount of these positives. However, that said, the surprise factor is going to come from earnings because let us face it, these are long structural trends in India and if people see the earnings come through, we may not rerate but stocks could still perform because they are getting the benefit of earnings. Sonia: You had a whole host of ministers who spoke at the conference. Who were you the most impressed with? A: All of them. It is very difficult to particularly take any names – I am not being political correct, this is straight from the heart, I guess most of them are very passionate about what they do and they have a very good understanding of their areas as also of the public domain. So, that is the reason and it is not about me being impressed or not being impressed, what really matters is the 250 investors who came there, were they happy with what they heard and saw. I can tell you we had a kick poll as the event was getting over and by and large -- investors as you know are already very positive on India, the standard emerging market fund is about 300 basis points overweight on India versus the benchmark but by and large the key takeaway was they were positive coming into the event and they have gone away keeping the faith. Anuj: You spoke about the ministers, what about corporates? Vishal Sikka was at your conference, what did investors take away from his body language? A: It is difficult to talk about individuals but as far as the IT space is concerned, we had a very interesting panel discussion where two of the top three companies were represented by top management as well as the chief of Nasscom and these days there is a lot of concern and rightly so on whether the slowdown in the sector is structural or is it cyclical. I guess the key takeaway really was, which all the panelists pointed out, was that every five or six years the sector has to reinvent itself. There is one opportunity which comes which you milk really well and that opportunity starts fading but you have to find the next opportunity. You had Y2K, you had the ERP phase, you had the financials phase and what really gave us a lot of confidence was that there was unanimity that there is this next phase of opportunities that are coming and which the sector is well positioned to exploit; doesn’t mean every company is going to do well. You have to be nimble and you have to have the necessary skill sets but again if you recall in 2000, there was this bunch of IT services companies out of which about three to five really made the transition to the next phase, the others fell off. Then in the next phase again there were 10-12, again three to five made the transition, the others fell off. So, these are very interesting times which is the reason I said every sector is seeing disruption so I guess more than the sector call, it is about looking at the individual companies and who has the right competitive strategy, the right management bandwidth to accomplish success. Latha: Your earnings growth for the current year and next? A: This year we would go for about 10 percent or thereabouts but that said the exit rate should be in the region of 12-14 percent which means as far as the next year is concerned -- for this year I would say you will have the first two quarters at about 5-6 percent and once I guess the aggressive provisioning by the financial stars abating, we perhaps move to the low double digit category and next year I think about 15 percent should be on.

(AP) Wells Fargo was, until last week, America's most valued money centre bank, the crown jewel of Warren Buffet's investment portfolio, a model of corporate excellence whose pedigree goes back to the rise of San Francisco as a financial hub in the 1850s after the California gold rush. Yet Wells Fargo is now mired in one of the most sordid scandals in post 2008 global banking. Wells Fargo retail bankers opened more than two million unauthorised accounts without the knowledge of clients to meet sales targets. The bank has fired more than 5,300 employees (its retail banking empire, called the Community Bank, has a payroll of 100,000) and its CEO John Stumpf, Mr Clean of banking will be grilled by a hostile Congress in the Senate. The bank's shares have plunged from a 52 week high of 56 to 46. While Goldman's Blankfein survived the Abacus CDO and J.P. Morgan's Jamie Dimon survived the London Whale scandal, Stumpf's scandal comes amid an election season where Big Banking is in the crosshairs of both Mrs Clinton and Trump. Wells Fargo has paid $185 million to settle charges but I can easily envisage criminal charges of property/identity theft against supervisors in the bank's California branch network. Warren Buffett owns 10 per cent of Wells Fargo, the biggest mortgage lender in the US that avoided the capital markets losses and toxic derivatives disasters of 2008. Wells Fargo has agreed to end its controversial incentive linked sales target and cross-selling strategies that led to this scandal. The fired retail bankers opened unauthorised accounts to hit sales targets and receive bonuses. It does not help Wells Fargo's public reputation that Carrie Tolstedt, the head of retail banking, has taken home $125 million in compensation. An executive pay clawback as mandated by Dodd Frank is now inevitable, as was the case in J.P. Morgan's London Whale trading scandal. It is entirely possible that Wells Fargo will have to pay much higher fees before this scandal is over. The bank's decision to eliminate incentive based product sales goals and cross selling targets will also hit its formidable retail banking revenue generation machine. After all, retail banking is 57 per cent of total revenue and 60 per cent of pretax income for Wells Fargo, the reason it enjoyed such a valuation premium in the stock markets. Carrie Tolstedt will not survive but the Senate Banking Committee could demand a wholesale purge of senior executives at the bank. The bank has faced huge reputational damage with investors, regulators and customers. This will distract senior management from new growth initiatives. I would only become interested in Wells Fargo shares if the bank falls to 40. It is impossible to quantify the legal bill and reputational damages the bank will face as Elizabeth Warren grills CEO john Stumpf in the Senate and the global media. United Technologies (UTX) is one of the world's most highly respected industrial conglomerates, the owner of such iconic brands at Pratt and Whitney aircraft engines, Otis elevator and HVAC systems. At 100, the bank trades at 14.5 times earnings based on a consensus 2017 estimate of $6.92 EPS. The company beat second quarter Street estimates thanks to stellar results in its Climate Controls and Security units, a business that generates 20 per cent plus operating margins and is the firm's growth engine. The shares have sagged due to exposure to the UK, European and Chinese building markets. However, I doubt if there is more than $7 downside in the shares even if Wall Street gets ugly in October. This means downside at UTX is limited to 94 or 13.4 times forward earnings at a time when management is poised to raise guidance and implement a share buyback that could be at least three per cent of market capitalisation. United Technologies is a global industrial colossus because 45 per cent of its $56 billion revenue is recurrent and CEO Greg Hayes divested Sikorsky Helicopter for $9 billion to boost shareholder returns via buybacks. With a dividend yield of almost three per cent, this Dow 30 stock is in the value zone. A 94-120 trading range means the enables myriad money making options based strategies.

CLOSE Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Friday, November 18, 2016 Insider K Street Lifestyle Opinion Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Home Economy Treasury Penalizes Big Banks for Poor Work on Home Loan Modifications Policy Economy Treasury Penalizes Big Banks for Poor Work on Home Loan Modifications By Nigel Roberts - 1:00pm June 27, 2011 581 1 SHARE Facebook Twitter Three of the largest mortgage-service companies received a warning from the U.S. Treasury Department for failing to meet standards under the Home Affordable Modification Program. Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase need “substantial improvement,” the Treasury said in a June 9 report. Consequently, the Treasury will withhold financial incentive payments to the banks. The Home Affordable Modification Program pays mortgage-service companies $1,000 for each loan that is modified and $1,000 a year for three years if the borrower pays on time. Funding comes from $50 billion set aside from the bank bailout. This financial incentive to modify home loans is intended to encourage lenders to work with struggling homeowners rather than foreclose on their mortgages. The Treasury assesses participating mortgage-service companies in three categories of program implementation: identifying and contacting homeowners; homeowner evaluation and assistance; and program reporting, management and governance. “While we continue to get tens of thousands of new homeowners into mortgage modifications each month, we need servicers to step up their performance to meet the needs of those still struggling,” said acting Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability Tim Massad, in a statement. Massad continued: “These assessments set a new benchmark by providing an unprecedented level of disclosure around servicer performance and will serve to keep the pressure on servicers to more effectively assist struggling families.” Wells Fargo said the Treasury’s assessment “paints an unfairly negative picture” of the bank’s modification efforts. “We are formally disputing this with the Treasury,” Wells Fargo spokeswoman Teri Schrettenbrunner told Bloomberg News. The other banks also disputed the assessment. In a statement, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, praised the Obama administration for its enforcement action against the banks. Waters added that the three companies had developed the practice of foreclosing “on millions of homeowners, often without properly screening them for modifications or otherwise following program rules.” Waters said she considers the penalties “just a first step in straightening out the servicing industry.” Going forward, she plans to continue urging banking regulators to use their examination and enforcement authority “to clean up industry practices.” The foreclosure prevention program has harsh critics. It has been “an abysmal failure that hurt more homeowners than it has helped,” said Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-North Carolina, in a statement. He authored the Home Affordable Modification Program Termination Act and called on the Senate to approve his measure. In its statement, the Treasury defended the Obama administration’s efforts have helped struggling families to stay in their homes. It reported that more than 4.8 million modification arrangements were started between April 2009 and the end of March 2011. According to the Treasury, about 29,000 homeowners received a trial modification in April, and 29,000 additional homeowners received a permanent modification with a median payment reduction of 37 percent — or more than $500 every month. The Treasury also cited Ocwen Loan Servicing LLC for poor performance. However, the agency did not penalize Ocwen because it had acquired a large servicing portfolio during the testing period.

Jeffrey Jones And Andrew Willis CALGARY and TORONTO — The Globe and Mail Published Monday, Sep. 19, 2016 4:40PM EDT Last updated Monday, Sep. 19, 2016 9:47PM EDT Comments Print / License AA Encana Corp. is raising more than $1-billion (U.S.) in a marketed share issue, a departure from priced bought deals that are more often used to raise money in the oil patch. Encana plans to use half the proceeds from the sale of 107 million shares to help fund its 2017 capital spending, much of which will be in the Permian shale oil play in Texas. The rest will be used to reduce debt, which has hovered slightly above industry norms. Chief executive Doug Suttles has fielded questions from analysts in recent months about the company’s $5.7-billion debt. Earlier this year, Moody’s cut the company’s debt rating to junk, citing high leverage and expected declines in production. Mr. Suttles has referred to several “levers” available to the company to deal with the situation, including more asset sales and equity issues, and said that the options are dependent on commodity prices. The shares are being sold for $9.35 apiece. The underwriters, led by Credit Suisse Securities (Canada) Inc. and JPMorgan, priced the stock late Monday, a few hours after Encana announced the financing. The price is based on the results of the quick marketing efforts by the syndicate, which has the option of selling an additional 16 million shares in an overallotment option. The stock closed at $9.86 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Marketed deals are priced based on demand and often sell at a discount to the market. Encana’s Toronto-listed shares closed at $13.03 (Canadian). Unlike a bought deal, underwriters do not risk their own capital by buying the shares for resale to investors. There is some risk in earmarking an equity financing for increasing capital spending as crude prices remain uncertain due to a global oversupply, and forecasters have recently said it could be well into 2017 before supply and demand come back into balance. Indeed, Crescent Point Energy Corp. shares tumbled earlier this month after the company issued $650-million of stock, partly to boost drilling. They remain well below the issue price. An investment banker who is not in the syndicate speculated that Credit Suisse and JPMorgan had likely guaranteed Encana a minimum price on the shares they are selling. However, the investment banks are not taking on the risks associated with a bought deal, so the fees will likely be less than the standard 4-per-cent fee on a bought-deal equity underwriting. This deal was widely expected, as Encana had talked about lowering debt levels and rivals including Suncor Energy Inc. have done successful equity offerings in recent months. Encana was offered bought-deal financings by Canadian investment banks in recent months, but opted to try to tap more U.S. investors by going with a marketed deal, which gives more opportunity to market the company’s equity offering. Encana has also raised money this year by selling assets. Earlier this year, the company said it would use a portion of proceeds from asset sales to increase 2016 spending by $200-million (U.S.), from a previous range of $900-million to $1-billion. In June, it struck a deal to sell oil and natural gas assets in northwestern Alberta to Birchcliff Energy Ltd. for $625-million (Canadian). It previously sold its properties in Colorado to a group backed by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. It’s been a year of monster equity offerings in the energy sector. Besides Suncor’s $2.8-billion issue, TransCanada raised a Canadian record $4.42-billion and Enbridge Inc. sold $2.3-billion of shares.

US District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan rejected a bid by Anthony Murgio to dismiss two charges related to his alleged operation of Coin.mx, which prosecutors have called an unlicensed bitcoin exchange. Murgio had argued that bitcoin did not qualify as “funds” under the federal law prohibiting the operation of unlicensed money transmitting businesses. But the judge, like her colleague Jed Rakoff in an unrelated 2014 case, said the virtual currency met that definition. “Bitcoins are funds within the plain meaning of that term,” Nathan wrote. “Bitcoins can be accepted as a payment for goods and services or bought directly from an exchange with a bank account. They therefore function as pecuniary resources and are used as a medium of exchange and a means of payment.” The decision did not address six other criminal counts that Murgio faces, Nathan wrote. Lawyers for Murgio did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Prosecutors last year charged Murgio over the operation of Coin.mx, and in April charged his father Michael with participating in bribery aimed at supporting it. Authorities have said Coin.mx was owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli man who, along with two others, was charged with running a sprawling computer hacking and fraud scheme targeting a dozen companies, including JPMorgan, and exposing personal data of more than 100 million people. That alleged scheme generated hundreds of millions of dollars of profit through pumping up stock prices, online casinos, money laundering and other illegal activity, prosecutors have said. Shalon has pleaded not guilty, and is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Centre in Manhattan. He hired new lawyers last month and is seeking permission to replace lawyers who joined the case in June, a Monday court filing showed. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Fintech association anticipates regional investments European stocks falter, euro hits 12-month dollar low Donald Trump takes credit for helping to save a Ford plant that wasn’t closing Trump has made equities great again, as investors flee bonds With Trump win, China looks to seize Asia free trade leadership Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Britney Spears, TInashe get down for a ‘Slumber Party’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) A Tribe Called Quest spit fire in ‘We the People’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Bloomberg Video: Resurrecting Jaguar’s legendary XKSS supercar Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles Singapore to test digital currency in latest fintech initiative (VIDEO) Bitcoin playing gold again makes even less sense now After US$65m hack, questions if Bitcoin can ever be safe Bitcoin traders making 700pc returns lose millions in hack attack Bitfinex exchange customers to get 36pc haircut, debt token Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Global stock markets started the new trading week strongly Monday, Sept. 19, 2016, as investors appeared to put last week's jitters behind them as they awaited the outcome of the latest policy meetings of the U.S. Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan later this week. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1) New York • U.S. stocks wobbled and finished mostly lower Monday as investors waited for central bank meetings in the United States and Japan. Health care and technology companies took some of the biggest losses while banks rose. Investors were indecisive as leaders of the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan prepared to meet, and stocks swung several times between gains and losses. The Dow rose as much as 131 points early on, then fell as much as 30 points in the afternoon. Banks, utility companies and machinery makers rose. Bond yields edged higher and the dollar weakened. Russ Koesterich, head of asset allocation with BlackRock's Global Allocation Fund, said investors don't expect the Fed to raise interest rates. However he said investors have more questions about the Bank of Japan's plans. VIDEOS TOP JOBS "They could decide to introduce more stimulus, but it could take a lot of different forms," he said. "One of the questions ... is not only what will they do, but what would the market like to see?" While advancing stocks far outnumbered decliners, the Dow Jones industrial average dipped 3.63 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 18,120.17. The Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 0.04 points to 2,139.12. The Nasdaq composite fell 9.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,235.03. The Federal Reserve will meet Tuesday and announce its latest decision on interest rates the following day. Banks got a boost as some investors hoped that interest rates will rise, which would allow banks to make more money from lending. JPMorgan Chase rose 37 cents to $66.19 and Wells Fargo regained 58 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $46.01. Technology products distributor Tech Data jumped after it said it will buy the technology solutions business of Avnet for $2.6 billion in cash and stock. Tech Data says the deal will give it operations in 35 countries. Its stock rose $15.46, or 22.3 percent, to $84.80 and Avnet gained $2.68, or 6.8 percent, to $41.89. Meanwhile, network control company Infoblox agreed to be bought by Vista Equity Partners for $26.50 per share, or $1.51 billion. It surged $3.52, or 15.4 percent, to $26.35. Despite those gains, the broader technology sector gave up an early advance and finished mostly lower. Apple, which surged last week and reached its highest price this year, lost $1.34, or 1.2 percent, to $113.58 and Intel fell 51 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $37.16. Health care stocks also lagged the market. Merck fell 95 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $61.33 after rival Sanofi said it sued company. Sanofi says Merck infringed on patents protecting its insulin drug Lantus. Eye drug maker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals fell $5.80, or 1.4 percent, to $402.83. Sarepta Therapeutics soared $20.79, or 73.9 percent, to $48.94 after the Food and Drug Administration granted tentative approval to its drug Exondys 51, a treatment for a type of muscular dystrophy. The drug treats Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare and deadly inherited disease that causes muscle weakness and eventually the loss of all basic movement. It usually causes death by age 25. The FDA had hesitated to approve the drug because advisers said there was little evidence it worked. Its approval is based on a study of only 12 patients, and the FDA is ordering Sarepta to run a larger study. Isle of Capri Casinos agreed to be bought by Eldorado Resorts for $23 per share, or $950 million in cash and stock. Combined, the companies own 21 casinos and race tracks. Isle of Capri stock jumped $5.11, or 30.2 percent, to $22.04 while Eldorado Resorts stock lost 41 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $13.84. Health website operator WebMD slumped after it said CEO David Schlanger is leaving the company by mutual agreement. Schlanger is being replaced by President Steven Zatz, who is in charge of WebMD's advertising and sponsorship business. WebMD fell $2.95, or 5.7 percent, to $49.02 and it is down 27 percent since May 25. General Motors gained 75 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $31.72 after an analyst said auto sales, which are at record highs, should remain strong for several years. Analyst Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley raised his rating on GM to "Overweight" and raised his price target to $37 a share from $29. » Next page...

Posted 19 Sep 2016 22:05 Updated 20 Sep 2016 04:45 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 15, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: A see-saw session on Wall Street on Monday ended little changed, with gains in big bank stocks offsetting a drag from Apple, as investors braced for the Federal Reserve meeting later this week. The Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at the two-day meeting, but investors will assess Chair Janet Yellen's speech on Wednesday to see if the central bank plans to hike as soon as December. After trading solidly higher during the morning, the benchmark S&P 500 pulled back and slid briefly into negative territory. The index has tallied four daily moves of at least 1 percent in the past couple of weeks after two months of calm. "The market has been all over the place. It’s been driven by the threat of higher interest rates," said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa. "Most people feel the most unloved bull market in recent memory will be cut off at the knees by higher interest rates, and the Fed is certainly threatening that in the near term." The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.63 points, or 0.02 percent, to 18,120.17, the S&P 500 lost 0.04 points, to 2,139.12 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 9.54 points, or 0.18 percent, to 5,235.03. Traders are betting that there is only a 12-percent chance the Fed will raise interest rates this week, but see a 55-percent chance the central bank will do so in December, according to the CME's FedWatch website. Investors also are eyeing the Bank of Japan's policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, while the first debate of the U.S. presidential election is set for next Monday. “You’re in a cycle in the market where political uncertainty and economic uncertainty are just so high that investors are taking advantage of any move up to sell and any selloff to buy," said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. "As a result we’re stuck in a trading range that we probably can’t break out of until you get through the Fed meeting, and you get through probably the debate next Monday, and you get a lot closer to the next round of earnings releases," Meckler said. JPMorgan , Bank of America and Wells Fargo all posted gains, and the KBW Bank index rose 0.5 percent. Energy shares slipped 0.1 percent, pulling back as oil prices pared gains during the session. "There seems to be still that strong correlation between what’s going on in crude and what’s going on in the broad market right now," said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. The real estate sector gained 1 percent. The stocks debuted as the 11th major S&P 500 group. Apple shares shed 1.2 percent after registering huge gains last week. The stock was the biggest drag on the three major U.S. indexes. Sarepta Therapeutics' shares rocketed 73.9 percent to US$48.94 after U.S. regulators approved its key muscle disorder drug. About 6.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.7 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. NYSE advancing issues outnumbered decliners 2.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 95 new highs and 30 new lows.

By Jon C. Ogg September 19, 2016 2:52 pm EST Print Email Tweet When scandals break, losses and opportunities can both arise. It has been without argument that Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE: WFC) has seen its image smeared and tainted after its account-opening scandal. We have seen some downgrades take place around the scandal as its tentacles are continuing to reach out and cause more pain and bad headlines for Wells Fargo. Now we have one analyst out actually upgrading the bank. Robert W. Baird’s research team decided that close to a 10% drop to $45.43 prior to Monday’s call was too much for the mighty Wells Fargo shares. This call should be viewed as a controversial one because of how much it cost Wells Fargo, then considering that this is just a day ahead of management getting grilled in Congressional hearings. Baird’s former Neutral rating was moved up to Outperform, and the firm assigned a $50.00 price target. Wells Fargo has a 52-week range of $44.50 to $56.34 and has a consensus analyst price target of $52.21. Baird pointed out that shares of Wells Fargo have now been down in 6 consecutive trading sessions, and it was also down in 9 of September’s 11 trading days prior to Monday. Wells Fargo’s market cap loss has been right at $25 billion after the scandal of creating unauthorized bank accounts in the cross selling that took place without actually selling. Baird pointed out that the damage has been similar to the “London Whale” scandal that cost J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) billions of dollars in recent years. Baird pointed out that the J.P. Morgan scandal was a clear a balance sheet issue, but Wells Fargo should not be viewed the same. J.P. Morgan’s earnings hit was clear at that time, while Baird thinks that the Wells Fargo revenue loss will not even cost the bank one-cent against its earnings per share. Scandals can be bad enough as is. Trying to get in the midst of them can be problematic at the onslaught. Still, uncertainty often creates opportunity — and Baird is viewing the recent weakness as an opportunity. Investors should keep that the consensus analyst price target was already coming down ahead of Wells Fargo’s major SNAFU here. Its consensus analyst target was $54.80 in mid-June, followed by $52.93 in mid-July and $53.00 in mid-August. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   Deutsche Bank recently opined on Wells Fargo with a Buy rating and $59.00 price target after the news broke. It said in its September 14 call: We can’t rule out additional legal and regulatory risk (State AGs of New York and California are investigating this issue per media reports this afternoon). That said, it’s worth noting that Wells Fargo’s 440 basis points of lag compare to a peak lag of 8% at BofA, 7% at M&T and 10% at J.P. Morgan over different periods (with most of the pain in the first week or first month). This suggests that the relative sell-off could be about 50% done, although each instance is unique. And while valuation matters less near term when such issues arise, they are relevant over time and Wells Fargo is about 10% cheaper versus peers than in the past. Wells Fargo now trades at a 5% P/E discount to large regional peers (vs. a 5% premium over the past 25 years) and a 10% premium to money center banks (versus a 20% premium historically). By Jon C.

The company expects to price its 14 million shares in the range of $11 to $13 per share, with an overallotment option for an additional 2.1 million. At the maximum price, the entire offering is valued up to $209.3 million. The company intends to list its shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol NTNX. The underwriters for the offering are Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, RBC Capital Markets, Baird, Needham, Oppenheimer, Pacific Crest, Piper Jaffray, Raymond James, Stifel and William Blair. This company provides a leading next-generation enterprise cloud platform that converges traditional silos of server, virtualization and storage into one integrated solution and can also connect to public cloud services. Its software-driven platform delivers the agility, scalability and pay-as-you-grow economics of the public cloud, while addressing enterprise requirements of application mobility, security, data integrity and control. Nutanix has combined advanced web-scale technologies with elegant consumer-grade design to deliver a powerful enterprise cloud platform that elevates IT organizations to focus on the applications and services that power their businesses. Nutanix refers to its platform as “invisible infrastructure” because it provides constant availability and low-touch management, enables application mobility across computing environments and reduces inefficiencies in IT planning. A few of the highlights the company noted in the filing: Average billings growth of 20% on a quarterly basis for the last eight fiscal quarters, which grew from $60.8 million in the three months ended October 31, 2014 to $206.6 million in the three months ended July 31, 2016. Average revenue growth of 17% on a quarterly basis for the last eight fiscal quarters, which grew from $46.1 million in the three months ended October 31, 2014 to $139.8 million in the three months ended July 31, 2016. An increase in deferred revenue of 713% over the last eight fiscal quarters, which grew from $36.5 million as of July 31, 2014 to $296.5 million as of July 31, 2016. The company plans to use the net proceeds from this offering primarily for capital expenditures, as well as for general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales and marketing activities, research and development and general and administrative matters.

The Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged at the two-day meeting, but investors will assess Chair Janet Yellen's speech on Wednesday for clues on the timing of the next rate hike. "There is an overriding sense that the Fed is going to move in December," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. The probability of a December move shot up to 70 percent in the past month from 57.5 percent in the previous month, according to a Reuters poll of over 100 economists. The S&P 500 financial index rose 1.18 percent, giving the biggest boost to the benchmark. The index is coming off its worst two-week decline since the Brexit vote in June, partly due to some Fed officials striking a dovish stance on rates. "The weakness seen last week (in financials) is attracting attention today," Pavlik said. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo rose between 1.2 percent and 1.7 percent and were the top influences on the S&P. The KBW Bank index registered its biggest percentage gain in nearly three weeks. The real estate index, which debuted on Monday, rose 1.27 percent and topped 10 of the 11 major S&P sectors. Investors will also keep an eye on the Bank of Japan's policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, where it is largely expected to not announce further policy easing. At 12:20 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 38.55 points, or 0.21 percent, at 18,162.35. The S&P 500 was up 3.98 points, or 0.19 percent, at 2,143.14. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.80 points, or 0.02 percent, at 5,243.76, dragged lower by a 1 percent fall in Apple. The dollar index declined 0.3 percent, sending gold prices higher, on dim prospects of a rate increase this week. Traders priced in a 15 percent chance of a rate hike by Wednesday, while the odds jumped to 56.5 percent for December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Sarepta Therapeutics' shares rocketed 86.7 percent to $52.43 after the FDA approved its key muscle disorder drug. Casino operator Isle of Capri jumped 30.2 percent after Eldorado Resorts said it would buy the company for $1.7 billion, including debt. Eldorado's shares fell 2.2 percent. General Motors rose 2.9 percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to "overweight". Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,248 to 683. On the Nasdaq, 1,829 issues rose and 908 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 10 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 87 new highs and 21 new lows.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 fluctuated and was up 0.4 percent at 16,579.19 in the morning session. Japanese markets were closed Monday for a national holiday. South Korea’s Kospi was little changed but inched down less than 0.1 percent to 2,014.75 in early trading. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dipped 0.3 percent to 23,486.45. The Shanghai Composite fell 0.2 percent to 3,020.96. FED FACTOR: The Federal Reserve will meet later Tuesday and announce its latest decision on interest rates the following day. Analysts say the Fed is unlikely to immediately raise interest rates, but they have more questions about the Bank of Japan’s plans, whose options include a range of stimulus proposals. BANK OF JAPAN: The Bank of Japan begins a two-day policy board meeting Tuesday, in the middle of national holidays on Monday and Thursday in what this nation calls Silver Week. The central bank could deepen negative interest rates that it announced earlier this year. WALL STREET: The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 3.63 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 18,120.17. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index lost 0.04 points to 2,139.12. The Nasdaq composite fell 9.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,235.03. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude lost 23 cents to $43.63 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, slipped 10 cents to $45.85 a barrel in London. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 101.88 yen from 102.05 yen late Monday in Asia. The euro rose to $1.1177 from $1.1165.

The Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged at the two-day meeting, but investors will assess Chair Janet Yellen's speech on Wednesday for clues on the timing of the next rate hike. "There is an overriding sense that the Fed is going to move in December," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. The probability of a December move shot up to 70 percent in the past month from 57.5 percent in the previous month, according to a Reuters poll of over 100 economists. The S&P 500 financial index rose 1.18 percent, giving the biggest boost to the benchmark. The index is coming off its worst two-week decline since the Brexit vote in June, partly due to some Fed officials striking a dovish stance on rates. "The weakness seen last week (in financials) is attracting attention today," Pavlik said. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo rose between 1.2 percent and 1.7 percent and were the top influences on the S&P. The KBW Bank index registered its biggest percentage gain in nearly three weeks. The real estate index, which debuted on Monday, rose 1.27 percent and topped 10 of the 11 major S&P sectors. Investors will also keep an eye on the Bank of Japan's policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, where it is largely expected to not announce further policy easing. At 12:20 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 38.55 points, or 0.21 percent, at 18,162.35. The S&P 500 was up 3.98 points, or 0.19 percent, at 2,143.14. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.80 points, or 0.02 percent, at 5,243.76, dragged lower by a 1 percent fall in Apple . The dollar index declined 0.3 percent, sending gold prices higher, on dim prospects of a rate increase this week. Traders priced in a 15 percent chance of a rate hike by Wednesday, while the odds jumped to 56.5 percent for December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Sarepta Therapeutics' shares rocketed 86.7 percent to $52.43 after the FDA approved its key muscle disorder drug. Casino operator Isle of Capri jumped 30.2 percent after Eldorado Resorts said it would buy the company for $1.7 billion, including debt. Eldorado's shares fell 2.2 percent. General Motors rose 2.9 percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to "overweight". Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,248 to 683. On the Nasdaq, 1,829 issues rose and 908 fell. The S&P 500 index showed 10 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 87 new highs and 21 new lows.

News Sports Entertainment Life Opinion Obituaries ePaper Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive US stocks rise as banks climb before Federal Reserve meeting Monday Sep 19, 2016 at 11:57 AM Sep 19, 2016 at 11:57 AM Marley Jay The Associated Press NEW YORK — U.S. stocks are making solid gains Monday morning as energy companies rise with the price of oil. Banks are making some of the biggest gains as investors wait for the Federal Reserve to meet this week. Several technology companies are rising on deal news.  KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 92 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,216 as of 11:32 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 9 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,148. The Nasdaq composite added 15 points, or 0.3 percent, to 5,259. Banks rose as investors hope the Federal Reserve will announce an increase in interest rates on Wednesday. JPMorgan Chase rose 72 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $66.54 and Bank of America rose 22 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $15.72. JACKPOT: Isle of Capri Casinos agreed to be bought by Eldorado Resorts for $23 per share, or $950 million in cash and stock. Combined, the companies own 21 casinos and race tracks. Isle of Capri stock jumped $5.1, or 30.5 percent, to $22.09 while Eldorado Resorts stock lost 26 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $13.99. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude added $1.02, or 2.4 percent, to $44.05 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose $1.02, or 2.2 percent, to $46.79 a barrel in London. Halliburton climbed 64 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $41.68 and Schlumberger added 50 cents to $76.83. SAREPTA SURGING: Sarepta Therapeutics soared $25, or 88.8 percent, to $53.15 after the Food and Drug Administration approved its drug Exondys 51, a treatment for a type of muscular dystrophy. The drug treats Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a rare and deadly inherited disease that causes muscle weakness and eventually the loss of all basic movement. It usually causes death by age 25. The FDA extended its review in May and Sarepta stock has made some big moves in recent months as analysts wondered if the drug would win approval. TECH DEALS: Information technology products distributor Tech Data jumped after it said it will buy the technology solutions business of Avnet for $2.6 billion in cash and stock. Tech Data says the deal will give it operations in 35 countries. Its stock rose $15, or 21.6 percent, to $84.34 and Avnet gained $3.47, or 8.8 percent, to $42.68. Meanwhile, network control company Infoblox agreed to be bought by Vista Equity Partners for $26.50 per share, or $1.51 billion. It surged $3.44, or 15 percent, to $26.27. FOCUSED: Johnson & Johnson agreed to buy Abbott Laboratories' eye health business Friday for around $4.3 billion in cash. Abbott Medical Optics makes lasers and other equipment used for cataract surgeries and laser vision correction procedures as well as eye drops and cleaners for contact lenses. It had about $1.1 billion in revenue last year. Abbott stock edged up 27 cents to $42.14 and Johnson & Johnson gained 13 cents to $118.38. SICK DAY: Health website operator WebMD slumped after it said CEO David Schlanger is leaving the company by mutual agreement. Schlanger is being replaced by President Steven Zatz, who is in charge of WebMD's advertising and sponsorship business. WebMD fell $3.24, or 6.2 percent, to $48.73 and it is down 27 percent since May 25. STEP ON THE GAS: General Motors gained 95 cents, or 3.1 percent, to $31.92 after an analyst said auto sales, which are at record highs, should remain strong for several years. Analyst Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley raised his rating on GM to "Overweight" and raised his price target to $37 a share from $29. BONDS: Bond prices edged lower. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 1.70 percent from 1.69 percent. CURRENCIES: The dollar fell to 101.68 yen from 102.42 yen. The euro rose to $1.1185 from $1.1151. OVERSEAS: The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares climbed 1.4 percent and the CAC-40 in France rose 1.3 percent. Germany's DAX was 0.8 percent higher. South Korea's Kospi added 0.8 percent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 0.9 percent. Trading in Japan was closed for a holiday. Australia's stock market suspended trading after a couple of hours due to technical glitches. The S&P/ASX 200 finished little changed.

Channel NewsAsia Return to Mobile Site Wall Street ends flat as banks gain, Apple drags News TV Premier Watch Live 0 My Playlist Sign In Menu News Asia Pacific Singapore World Business Sport Entertainment Technology Health Lifestyle Videos Weather MORE Photos Special Reports Archives Services PSI Live Shows News Schedule Facebook Twitter Linkedin YouTube Mobile SMS eNews RSS Return to Mobile Site Business International Business Wall Street ends flat as banks gain, Apple drags A see-saw session on Wall Street on Monday ended little changed, with gains in big bank stocks offsetting a drag from Apple, as investors braced for the Federal Reserve meeting later this week. Posted 19 Sep 2016 22:05 Updated 20 Sep 2016 04:45 Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., September 15, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid Enlarge Caption  Email More A A REUTERS: A see-saw session on Wall Street on Monday ended little changed, with gains in big bank stocks offsetting a drag from Apple, as investors braced for the Federal Reserve meeting later this week. The Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at the two-day meeting, but investors will assess Chair Janet Yellen's speech on Wednesday to see if the central bank plans to hike as soon as December. After trading solidly higher during the morning, the benchmark S&P 500 pulled back and slid briefly into negative territory. The index has tallied four daily moves of at least 1 percent in the past couple of weeks after two months of calm. "The market has been all over the place. It’s been driven by the threat of higher interest rates," said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa. "Most people feel the most unloved bull market in recent memory will be cut off at the knees by higher interest rates, and the Fed is certainly threatening that in the near term." The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.63 points, or 0.02 percent, to 18,120.17, the S&P 500 lost 0.04 points, to 2,139.12 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 9.54 points, or 0.18 percent, to 5,235.03. Traders are betting that there is only a 12-percent chance the Fed will raise interest rates this week, but see a 55-percent chance the central bank will do so in December, according to the CME's FedWatch website. Investors also are eyeing the Bank of Japan's policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, while the first debate of the U.S. presidential election is set for next Monday. “You’re in a cycle in the market where political uncertainty and economic uncertainty are just so high that investors are taking advantage of any move up to sell and any selloff to buy," said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. "As a result we’re stuck in a trading range that we probably can’t break out of until you get through the Fed meeting, and you get through probably the debate next Monday, and you get a lot closer to the next round of earnings releases," Meckler said. JPMorgan , Bank of America and Wells Fargo all posted gains, and the KBW Bank index rose 0.5 percent. Energy shares slipped 0.1 percent, pulling back as oil prices pared gains during the session. "There seems to be still that strong correlation between what’s going on in crude and what’s going on in the broad market right now," said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. The real estate sector gained 1 percent. The stocks debuted as the 11th major S&P 500 group. Apple shares shed 1.2 percent after registering huge gains last week. The stock was the biggest drag on the three major U.S. indexes. Sarepta Therapeutics' shares rocketed 73.9 percent to US$48.94 after U.S. regulators approved its key muscle disorder drug. About 6.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.7 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. NYSE advancing issues outnumbered decliners 2.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 95 new highs and 30 new lows.

The central bank is expected to leave rates unchanged at the two-day meeting, but investors will assess Fed Chair Janet Yellen's speech on Wednesday for clues on the timing of the next rate hike. The probability of a December move shot up to 70 percent in the past month from 57.5 percent in the previous month, according to a Reuters poll of over 100 economists. The S&P 500 financial index rose 0.97 percent, topping 10 of 11 major sectors trading higher. The index lost 1.3 percent last week, partly due to some Fed officials striking a dovish stance on rates. "The weakness seen last week (in financials) is attracting attention today," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo rose more than 1 percent and were the top influences on the S&P. The energy index rose 0.91 percent, recovering from the six-week low it hit last Wednesday, as oil prices climbed more than 2 percent. Investors will also keep an eye on the Bank of Japan's policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, where it is largely expected to not announce further policy easing. At 11:00 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 90.53 points, or 0.5 percent, at 18,214.33, the S&P 500 was up 9.3 points, or 0.43 percent, at 2,148.46 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 13.61 points, or 0.26 percent, at 5,258.17. The dollar index declined 0.38 percent, sending gold prices higher, on dim prospects of a rate increase this week. Traders priced in a 12 percent chance of a rate hike by Wednesday, while the odds jumped to 56 percent for December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Sarepta Therapeutics' shares soared 74 percent after the FDA approved its key muscle disorder drug. Casino operator Isle of Capri jumped 31 percent after Eldorado Resorts said it would buy the company for $1.7 billion, including debt. General Motors rose 3 percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to "overweight". U.S. electrical components distributor Avnet was up 8.8 percent after it announced the sale of its IT business to tech products distributor Tech Data Corp for about $2.6 billion. Tech Data's stock soared 21 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,427 to 484. On the Nasdaq, 1,938 issues rose and 746 fell. The S&P 500 index showed nine new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 84 new highs and 13 new lows.

 Wall Street rises as oil prices recover Reuters Sep. 19, 2016, 9:59 AM 414 facebook linkedin twitter email print Traders work on the floor of the NYSE Thomson Reuters By Yashaswini Swamynathan (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were higher on Monday as oil prices bounced back from multi-week lows and investors expected the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged at its meeting this week. Oil prices rose about 1 percent after Venezuela said OPEC and non-OPEC producers were close to a deal to stabilize an oversupplied market. [O/R] The S&P 500 energy index <.spny> rose 0.69 percent, recouping some losses after hitting a six-week low last Wednesday.</.spny> The Fed's two-day meeting starts on Tuesday in which policymakers will debate over the U.S. economy and its ability to absorb a rate hike. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to conclude the meeting with a press conference at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) on Wednesday. Yellen said last month the case for a rate increase had strengthened. But recent lackluster data, including a slowdown in jobs growth, has raised doubts about the health of the economy. "The market is resigned to the fact that the Fed won't move in September," said Matt Jones, head of U.S. equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. "But some uneasiness with the Fed will be on how they talk about December." The probability of a December move shot up to 70 percent in the past month from 57.5 percent in the previous month, according to a Reuters poll of over 100 economists. The CME Group's FedWatch tool shows traders setting a 12 percent chance of a rate hike by Wednesday, while the odds jumped to nearly 55 percent for December. The dollar index <.dxy> declined 0.38 percent, sending gold prices higher, on dim prospects of a rate increase this week.</.dxy> Investors will also keep an eye on the Bank of Japan's policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, where it is largely expected to not announce further policy easing. At 9:38 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average <.dji> was up 90.87 points, or 0.5 percent, at 18,214.54, the S&P 500 <.spx> was up 9.52 points, or 0.45 percent, at 2,148.68 and the Nasdaq Composite <.ixic> was up 22.58 points, or 0.43 percent, at 5,267.15.</.ixic></.spx></.dji> Eight of the 11 major S&P 500 indexes were higher, with the materials sector <.splrcm> rising the most by 0.72 percent. The S&P real estate index <.splrcr> debuted on Monday with a 0.44 percent rise.</.splrcr></.splrcm> Shares of casino operator Isle of Capri jumped 28.5 percent on Monday after Eldorado Resorts said it would buy the company for $1.7 billion, including debt. Eldorado's stock dropped 22.7 percent. General Motors was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500, up 2.52 percent at $31.76, after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to "overweight". U.S. electrical components distributor Avnet was up 7.2 percent at $42.11 after it announced the sale of its IT business to tech products distributor Tech Data Corp for about $2.6 billion. Tech Data's stock soared 17.2 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,271 to 418. On the Nasdaq, 1,698 issues rose and 659 fell. The S&P 500 index showed five new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 50 new highs and seven new lows.

Paul Coster, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co., said the high-profile event may signal the Karma will impress investors. GoPro may also release the next iteration of its tiny cube-shaped camera, the Hero 5, according to Tavis McCourt, an analyst at Raymond James. Both analysts rate the stock the equivalent of buy. Karma Drone Source: GoPro The shares rose to as high as $15.90 in trading before the market opened in New York. GoPro is counting on its drone to help revive a stock that’s fallen 17 percent this year and is down almost 85 percent from its October 2014 high. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jitendra Waral said the Karma launch will be a “pivotal event for the company,” and a chance to renew sales growth by “jump-starting” a nascent category through its brand strength and dedicated user base. While the details surrounding GoPro’s drone have been kept tightly under wraps, the company is entering a crowded market. Karma won’t only have to compete with the new iPhone 7 from Apple Inc. released earlier this month with an upgraded camera, but also the industry leader, SZ DJI Technology Co.

Oil prices rose about 1.3 percent after Venezuela said OPEC and non-OPEC producers were close to a deal to stabilize an oversupplied market. [O/R] The Fed's two-day meeting starts on Tuesday in which policymakers will debate over the U.S. economy and its ability to absorb a rate hike. Fed Chair Janet Yellen is scheduled to conclude the meeting with a press conference at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT) on Wednesday. Yellen said last month the case for a rate increase had strengthened. But recent lackluster data, including a slowdown in jobs growth, has raised doubts about the health of the economy. "The market is resigned to the fact that the Fed won't move in September," said Matt Jones, head of U.S. equity strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank in New York. "But some uneasiness with the Fed will be on how they talk about December." The probability of a December move shot up to 70 percent in the past month from 57.5 percent in the previous month, according to a Reuters poll of over 100 economists. The CME Group's FedWatch tool shows traders setting a 12 percent chance of a rate hike by Wednesday, while the odds jumped to nearly 55 percent for December. The dollar index fell 0.25 percent on dim prospects of a rate increase this week. [O/R] Investors will also keep an eye on the Bank of Japan's policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, where it is largely expected to not announce further policy easing. Dow e-minis were up 87 points at 8:29 a.m. ET, or 0.48 percent, with 18,128 contracts changing hands. S&P 500 e-minis were up 10.25 points, or 0.48 percent, with 134,395 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 17.5 points, or 0.36 percent, on volume of 25,157 contracts. Wall Street closed lower on Friday, capping a week of market oscillations, as financials were weighed down by the possibility of a $14 billion fine against Deutsche Bank and as investors second-guessed the Fed's intentions on rates. Data expected on Monday includes a report on the U.S. housing market that is likely to show housing starts fell to a 1.19 million-unit rate in August from a 1.21 million-unit pace in the previous month. The report is due at 10:00 a.m. ET. Shares of casino operator Isle of Capri jumped 28.5 percent in premarket trading on Monday after Eldorado Resorts said it would buy the company for $1.7 billion, including debt. Eldorado's stock dropped 22.7 percent. Facebook edged 0.68 percent higher to $129.95 after Citigroup raised its price target. U.S. electrical components distributor Avnet was up 8.4 percent at $42.5 after it announced the sale of its IT business to tech products distributor Tech Data Corp for about $2.6 billion. Tech Data's stock was up 7.1 percent.

Ghany Reuters/Mohamed Abd El Ghany (Updates with $4 billion loan negotiation) CAIRO, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Egypt will start talks with China over a $2 billion loan next week and plans to issue international bonds in October or November, Deputy Finance Minister for Treasury Mohamed Meait said on Monday. The Egyptian government approved the potential sale of $3 billion to $5 billion of international bonds in August and engaged JPMorgan , Citi , BNP Paribas , and Natixisto act as lead managers. Deputy Finance Minister Ahmed Kojak said earlier Egypt was in talks with China over a loan but gave no further details. "All the details are with the central bank," he said. Advertisement International Cooperation Minister Sahar Nasr meanwhile told the state news agency on Monday that Egypt is in talks with China over a loan of $4 billion. Of that, $1 billion would be used to support foreign reserves, with $3 billion allocated for developmental projects, Nasr said. Egypt has reached a preliminary agreement with the International Monetary Fund over a $12 billion loan programme but must secure another $5-6 billion in bilateral financing to secure the IMF board's approval. An IMF official said last week that the Fund had held "very productive discussions" with authorities in China and Saudi Arabia about their contributing to that bilateral financing. Egypt has struggled to revive its economy since a popular uprising in 2011 that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak but drove away tourists and foreign investors, the country's major sources of foreign currency. Reserves have tumbled from $36 billion in 2011 to around $16.56 billion at the end of August, equivalent to just over three months' worth of imports.

Wells Fargo is in the spotlight after its employees allegedly created up to 2 million bank and credit card accounts, transferred customers' money without telling them and even created fake email addresses to sign people up for online banking in an effort to meet lofty sales goals.

It'll be the entire industry. (AP Photo/Richard Drew) NEW YORK, N.Y. - When Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf testifies before a Senate committee hearing Tuesday, it won't be just his bank under fire for turning friendly branches into high-pressure sales centres. It'll be the entire industry. Wells Fargo is in the spotlight now after its employees allegedly opened up to 2 million bank and credit card accounts, transferred customers' money without telling them and even created fake email addresses to sign people up for online banking in an effort to meet lofty sales goals. But cross-selling, as it is called, is the lifeblood of the entire retail banking industry. Other banks don't face allegations of fraud, like Wells Fargo is, but experts say the industry as a whole engages in high-pressure sales tactics. Once customers open a basic savings or checking account, banks give them the hard sell to sign up for even more, whether that's a credit card or a mortgage or a retirement account. Overdraft protection was one common tactic, former Wells bankers said, telling customers to open an additional savings account to put aside money to cover overdrafts even though the customer didn't have the resources to fund the account. Or getting the customer to open a new credit card just for overdraft protection. Surveys done last year by consulting firm cg42 showed that roughly 40 per cent of Wells Fargo customers asked said their No. 1 complaint was employees' constant pushing of products the customers did not need or want. But customers at other banks made similar complaints. Of Bank of America customers, 31 per cent said they felt overly pressured for products they didn't want or need. At both Chase and Citigroup, that figure was 27 per cent. "Bank of America, Citi, Chase were all envious of Wells' ability to cross-sell as well as they did," said Steve Beck, a managing partner with cg42. While customers complained of overly aggressive sales tactics, none of the other banks have been accused of wrongdoing except Wells. The change in focus for retail banks had been taking place slowly for years, but the financial crisis that began in 2007 and the impact on banks fueled faster change. The Federal Reserve's cutting interest rates to nearly zero gave the economy a boost during the Great Recession, but it also eviscerated the banks' ability to earn interest income, spurring them to seek out new forms of revenue — often in the form of fees. And the more products a customer has, the more potential there is for a bank to earn fees. Those could be the overdraft fees at a checking account or management fees of a retiree's nest egg. Another benefit for the industry is that having several products with a bank makes it more difficult for customers to leave and switch to a new one, said Bob Hedges, a banking industry consultant with A.T. Kearney. To adapt to their new business model, banks have been physically transforming their branches. Chase, Citi, BofA and Wells have all opened smaller branches with few, if any, teller windows for routine transactions like depositing checks or account inquiries that are more often handled at ATMs or on the Internet. Instead, there's more square footage for personal bankers to assist customers with their needs — or possibly sell them additional products. Wells makes a point of calling its locations "stores" instead of branches. "Cross-selling is hard, difficult work, but ultimately it's about keeping customers banking with you," Hedges said. "But you also risk alienating your customers when you cross-sell too hard." Wells Fargo, familiar to customers for its stagecoach logo, had also long been known in the banking industry for its aggressive sales goals. The average Wells Fargo household had on average more than six products with the bank, a metric Wells top executives would highlight every quarter with investors. The bank even had a "Gr-Eight" program aiming to raise that number to eight. Wells never reached that level. Wells' definition of a "product" covers many types of services, Hedges said. Online banking, a savings account and a checking account could all be considered separate products at Wells. Customers at other banks usually have no more than three products, said Hedges. Wells Fargo's CEO previously said the behaviour was isolated to a handful of employees and managers. But in remarks prepared for his appearance Tuesday, which were obtained by The Associated Press, Stumpf offers a mea culpa. Wells has said it fired more than 5,000 employees for misconduct. After being fined last week, Wells pledged to end the sales goals program by the end of the year. Ruth Landaverde, a former worker at both Wells Fargo and Bank of America, said the pressure was intense at Wells and at BofA. She worked for Wells Fargo from 2009 to 2010 at a division that sold additional products like credit cards to already existing customers. Stress got so high that Landaverde said she developed a tic in her eye and sleep problems. Landaverde said she had to sell four credit cards and four auto loans each week, as well as three home mortgages or refinance submissions. She said the quotas were simply to keep her job, not to earn any substantial commission or bonus. "I wasn't going to do something unethical, but the sales pressure was very real," she said. "I can see why some employees did what they did." ____ Ken Sweet covers banks and consumer financial issues for The Associated Press.

Wells Fargo is in the spotlight after its employees allegedly created up to 2 million bank and credit card accounts, transferred customers' money without telling them and even created fake email addresses to sign people up for online banking in an effort to meet lofty sales goals. When Stumpf testifies before a Senate committee hearing Tuesday, Sept. 20, 2016, it won't be just his bank under fire for turning friendly branches into high-pressure sales centers. It'll be the entire industry. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)       E-mail this Gallery Print this Gallery Share this Gallery         Photo Galleries »   Leonard Cohen Photos: Leonard Cohen honoured...

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 10:15 PM, September 19, 2016 Updated: 7:05 AM, September 20, 2016 A see-saw session on Wall Street on Monday ended little changed, with gains in big bank stocks offsetting a drag from Apple, as investors braced for the Federal Reserve meeting later this week. The Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at the two-day meeting, but investors will assess Chair Janet Yellen's speech on Wednesday to see if the central bank plans to hike as soon as December. After trading solidly higher during the morning, the benchmark S&P 500 pulled back and slid briefly into negative territory. The index has tallied four daily moves of at least 1 percent in the past couple of weeks after two months of calm. "The market has been all over the place. It’s been driven by the threat of higher interest rates," said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa. "Most people feel the most unloved bull market in recent memory will be cut off at the knees by higher interest rates, and the Fed is certainly threatening that in the near term." The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 3.63 points, or 0.02 percent, to 18,120.17, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 0.04 points, to 2,139.12 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 9.54 points, or 0.18 percent, to 5,235.03. Traders are betting that there is only a 12-percent chance the Fed will raise interest rates this week, but see a 55-percent chance the central bank will do so in December, according to the CME's FedWatch website. Investors also are eyeing the Bank of Japan's policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, while the first debate of the U.S. presidential election is set for next Monday. “You’re in a cycle in the market where political uncertainty and economic uncertainty are just so high that investors are taking advantage of any move up to sell and any selloff to buy," said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. "As a result we’re stuck in a trading range that we probably can’t break out of until you get through the Fed meeting, and you get through probably the debate next Monday, and you get a lot closer to the next round of earnings releases," Meckler said. JPMorgan <JPM.N>, Bank of America <BAC.N> and Wells Fargo <WFC.N> all posted gains, and the KBW Bank index <.BKX> rose 0.5 percent. Energy shares <.SPNY> slipped 0.1 percent, pulling back as oil prices pared gains during the session. "There seems to be still that strong correlation between what’s going on in crude and what’s going on in the broad market right now," said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. The real estate sector <.SPLRCR> gained 1 percent. The stocks debuted as the 11th major S&P 500 group. Apple <AAPL.O> shares shed 1.2 percent after registering huge gains last week. The stock was the biggest drag on the three major U.S. indexes. Sarepta Therapeutics' <SRPT.O> shares rocketed 73.9 percent to $48.94 after U.S. regulators approved its key muscle disorder drug. About 6.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.7 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. NYSE advancing issues outnumbered decliners 2.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored advancers. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 95 new highs and 30 new lows.

For Wells Fargo, this may be the bottom. Baird Equity Research is telling its readers to catch that falling knife ahead of Tuesday's Senate hearing, where lawmakers will grill CEO John Stumpf about Wells Fargo's customer account fraud. Analysts on Monday upgraded Wells Fargo's rating from neutral to outperform and assigned a price target of $50 per share to its stock, coming less than two weeks after the bank's shares began a tumble that would cost them more than 10 percent of their value. The stock was changing hands at around $46 on Monday. "The stock has gone from loved to loathed in two to three weeks," analysts wrote, "and we believe the sell-off creates a good relative buying opportunity." show chapters <p>Marcus Lemonis: Wells Fargo CEO might be responsible </p> <p>&quot;The Profit,&quot; Marcus Lemonis, addresses who should take responsibility for the issues at Wells Fargo.</p> Marcus Lemonis: Wells Fargo CEO might be responsible    Friday, 16 Sep 2016 | 1:19 PM ET | 01:20 Other big banking scandals, such as JPMorgan Chase's so-called London whale, have had a meaningful effect on banks' balance sheet, Baird analysts wrote. Although shares of Wells plunged in recent days as legislators' criticism stacked up, "revenue impact for [Wells Fargo] does not even compute to a penny [per] share." The bank was rapped with a $185 million fine by agencies including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau two weeks ago, and since then, lawmakers have piled pressure onto Wells Fargo executives. On Tuesday, CEO Stumpf is expected to testify in a Senate banking committee hearing. He's also to testify before the House Financial Services Committee this month. To be sure, other analysts' long-term view on the bank is not as optimistic. A Fitch Ratings report said the bank's pledge to eliminateproduct sales goals for retail staffers could have an impact on Wells Fargo's revenue. "We believe this issue creates reputational risk given the issue and allegations are understandable to the general public, in a way that misdeeds at other banks are not," Fitch analysts wrote Monday.

Bundrick, CFP NerdWallet 8:53 a.m. Monday, Sept. 19, 2016 Business and Money news 0 The hand wringing over a quarter-point Fed rate hike is on. That’s the amount the Federal Reserve is expected to raise short-term interest rates; the question is, when? The Fed meets this week, announces its decision on Wednesday and meets twice more before the end of the year. When the Fed pulls the trigger, here’s what to expect. It’s a matter of time Steve Rick, chief economist at CUNA Mutual Group, a trade association for credit unions, believes the nation’s central bank will wait on raising short-term interest rates until its December meeting. “Wages are still rising by 2.6% year over year, and unemployment is kind of stuck at 4.9% and hasn’t dropped much. And so, with inflation still running low and wage pressures not building, I think that gives the Fed the leeway to have a little bit more patience and keep interest rates at exceptionally low levels for another two to three months,” Rick says. Robert Dietz, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders, is another December believer. “We are forecasting one rate hike in 2016, after the December meeting,” Dietz says. “NAHB believes that mortgage interest rates will remain at historically low levels in the quarters ahead. Income growth and solid job creation are positive tailwinds for the housing market, and we are finally seeing evidence of builders moving into the entry-level market.” Seeing the futures These two economists aren’t the only ones betting the Fed won’t move on interest rates until December. Big money runners do, too. Institutional investors, hedge funds and the like stake a claim on the price of something on a future date. These “futures” are time and price investment contracts sold on everything from pork bellies to the weather — and Federal Reserve short-term interest rate hikes. Based on recent futures activity, the greatest share of Wall Street is betting on a Fed move no sooner than December, as you can see in the graph below. Banks stand to benefit from a Fed rate hike Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, believes it’s time for the Fed to start raising interest rates — now. “Twenty-five basis points (0.25 percentage point) is a drop in the bucket. Let’s just raise rates,” he said, speaking at the Economic Club of Washington last week. Of course, most lenders would likely agree. When interest rates finally move up, banks, credit unions and other financial institutions will earn more in interest on the capital they have to lend, which enhances their profit margins, Rick says. “Plus, short-term Treasury yields would go up,” he adds. “Plus, things like adjustable-rate credit cards will reprice, adjustable-rate mortgages will reprice, home equity loans will reprice. It will help the banking system. Banks and credit unions will be able to build capital faster, which will strengthen our banking system.” Guess who pays for all of that repricing. Consumers do. With a rate hike, how much more will you pay? A just-released TransUnion study measured the impact of interest rate increases on consumers. “[We] analyzed consumers with variable-rate products such as credit cards, HELOCs, and some mortgages and personal loans,” says Nidhi Verma, senior director of research and consulting for TransUnion. The study showed that with an expected 0.25 percentage point rate increase by the Fed, more than 92 million U.S. consumers holding variable rate credit products will see their monthly payments rise, but only by an average of $6.45. More than 9 million consumers will be at risk However, TransUnion says 10% of these borrowers — over 9.3 million people — will not be able to absorb the additional cost. “A portion of those consumers have an adjustable rate mortgage that will reset in the future or may have other variable rate products that could adjust in the future,” Verma says. And if the Fed proceeds with additional hikes into 2017, as is widely expected, TransUnion’s study found that with interest rates rising just 1 percentage point, an additional 2.5 million consumers might not have the financial capacity to absorb the “payment shock.” That’s a total of 11.8 million consumers at risk of falling behind on their payment obligations. But there are also consumers who would be unaffected by rising interest rates, TransUnion says. “For instance, some consumers are transactors — they pay their balances in full each month,” Verma said in a press release. “Some already have an APR of 29.99%, the highest permissible rate. Our data show there will indeed be an impact from potential interest rate rises, but it’s far less widespread than many anticipate.” A looming boon? Even if higher interest rates loom, Jeff Taylor, managing director of Digital Risk, an independent processor of home loans, isn’t looking for a major boon to home sales or mortgage refinances. “Rates have been historically low for so long that most people who want to refinance have already done so and buyers looking to purchase may have trouble finding a house, given skyrocketing home prices and low inventory in many markets,” Taylor says. The Fed raising interest rates is an indication of a healthier economy, Taylor says, which spurs more consumer confidence and encourages consumers to purchase or refinance homes. And that might mean a boost in mortgage lending this fall and winter, traditionally slower seasons for homebuying and lending.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermidMore By Lewis Krauskopf (Reuters) - A see-saw session on Wall Street on Monday ended little changed, with gains in big bank stocks offsetting a drag from Apple, as investors braced for the Federal Reserve meeting later this week. The Fed is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at the two-day meeting, but investors will assess Chair Janet Yellen's speech on Wednesday to see if the central bank plans to hike as soon as December. After trading solidly higher during the morning, the benchmark S&P 500 pulled back and slid briefly into negative territory. The index has tallied four daily moves of at least 1 percent in the past couple of weeks after two months of calm. "The market has been all over the place. It’s been driven by the threat of higher interest rates," said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa. "Most people feel the most unloved bull market in recent memory will be cut off at the knees by higher interest rates, and the Fed is certainly threatening that in the near term." The Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell 3.63 points, or 0.02 percent, to 18,120.17, the S&P 500 <.SPX> lost 0.04 points, to 2,139.12 and the Nasdaq Composite <.IXIC> dropped 9.54 points, or 0.18 percent, to 5,235.03. Traders are betting that there is only a 12-percent chance the Fed will raise interest rates this week, but see a 55-percent chance the central bank will do so in December, according to the CME's FedWatch website. Investors also are eyeing the Bank of Japan's policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, while the first debate of the U.S. presidential election is set for next Monday. “You’re in a cycle in the market where political uncertainty and economic uncertainty are just so high that investors are taking advantage of any move up to sell and any selloff to buy," said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. "As a result we’re stuck in a trading range that we probably can’t break out of until you get through the Fed meeting, and you get through probably the debate next Monday, and you get a lot closer to the next round of earnings releases," Meckler said. JPMorgan , Bank of America and Wells Fargo all posted gains, and the KBW Bank index <.BKX> rose 0.5 percent. Energy shares <.SPNY> slipped 0.1 percent, pulling back as oil prices pared gains during the session. "There seems to be still that strong correlation between what’s going on in crude and what’s going on in the broad market right now," said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. The real estate sector <.SPLRCR> gained 1 percent. The stocks debuted as the 11th major S&P 500 group. Apple shares shed 1.2 percent after registering huge gains last week. The stock was the biggest drag on the three major U.S. indexes. Sarepta Therapeutics' shares rocketed 73.9 percent to $48.94 after U.S. regulators approved its key muscle disorder drug. About 6.1 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.7 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data. NYSE advancing issues outnumbered decliners 2.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favoured advancers. The S&P 500 posted 11 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 95 new highs and 30 new lows.

Sean Williams (TMFUltraLong) Sep 19, 2016 at 8:41AM Image source: Getty Images. The leaves have begun changing color all across the country, and the weather is a little bit cooler. Fall is in the air -- and so is stock market volatility. There are a number of questions left to be answered this fall that could have a direct impact on the stock market and your portfolio. These include: Will the Federal Reserve raise lending rates? Who'll be the 45th president of the United States? Will U.S. economic growth pick up? Three top stocks on sale this fall Though the answers to these important questions are unknown at this point, investors don't have to sit idly on their hands awaiting the outcomes. Instead, long-term investors have the opportunity to seize the day by picking out attractively priced high-quality companies this fall that could help form a foundation of growth for their portfolio for years to come. Here are three top stocks trading at discounts that investors should consider buying this fall. Bank of America Fair warning: I've owned Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) for more than four years, so there's going to be a bit of bias in this response. I'd suggest that regardless of what the Fed does in September or going forward, Bank of America, which is down 7% year to date, remains a compelling buy candidate. An interest rate hikes would obviously be of great benefit to the banking sector because it would allow for net interest margins to expand. According to a 10-Q filed by Bank of America earlier this year, a 100-basis-point increase in both long-term and short-term lending rates would boost its interest income by $6 billion, which is essentially double (if not more) what its closest peers, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, would see in interest income increases. Over the long run, considering the long-term growth of the U.S. economy, it would be wise to expect interest rates to normalize at higher levels than they are now, which benefits B of A. Image source: Bank of America.  Even if the Fed chooses not to raise rates, there are shorter-term catalysts that could push Bank of America higher. CEO Brian Moynihan is looking to reduce Bank of America's annual expenditures by $5 billion by 2018 to an expected $53 billion. Moynihan will accomplish this through ongoing branch closures and a growing emphasis on mobile banking, which is not only more convenient for the consumer, but substantially cheaper than ATM and branch transactions. As icing on the cake, Bank of America has been beefing up its shareholder return policy with the blessing of the Fed after once again passing the annual financial stress test required of banks. Following the stress tests, Bank of America boosted its dividend by 50% and added a $5 billion share repurchase program to boot.  With Bank of America still trading below its tangible book value, and its legal issues more or less in the rearview mirror, now looks like the perfect time to consider taking a position. Celgene For growth investors looking for a top stock on sale this fall, I'd encourage you to turn your attention to Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) in the biotech industry. Why is Celgene down 11% year-to-date if it's such an attractive stock, you wonder? That answer essentially boils down to industrywide weakness in biotech stocks that began earlier in the year and still hasn't abated, coupled with Celgene's fiscal 2017 forecast coming in a bit below Wall Street's expectations. Following Celgene's first-quarter results, the company guided to a range of $12.7 billion to $13 billion in full-year sales and $6.75-$7 in EPS for 2017, down from a prior projection of $13 billion to $14 billion in sales and $7.25 in EPS. The primary reason for this reduction was a slowdown in sales for cancer drug Abraxane, which has been hit by the expansion of cancer immunotherapies into new indications. Image source: Getty Images. But what investors get with Celgene is an incredible organic, collaborative, and M&A growth machine. Multiple myeloma drug Revlimid and anti-inflammatory Otezla have the potential to grow sales by double-digits throughout the remainder of the decade while also expanding into a number of new indications. Celgene also has in excess of 30 collaborations that help reduce what it spends on internal research and development while ensuring its cash only heads toward the most promising experimental drugs. Many of its collaborations focus on first-in-class cancer therapies that could become standards of care if they perform well in clinical trials. Lastly, Celgene is relying, at least partially, on M&A to drive its growth. It acquired Receptos last year for $7.2 billion, gaining hold of promising experimental multiple sclerosis and ulcerative colitis drug ozanimod in the process. If approved for both indications, ozanimod sales are expected to hit $4 billion to $6 billion annually at their peak. With a PEG ratio of just 0.8 and a forward P/E that's down to 15, Celgene could be the shot in the arm growth investors are looking for this fall. NXP Semiconductors Finally, for investors with an even higher tolerance for risk and reward, I'd suggest picking NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) up off the sale rack. NXP has struggled under the weight of weakened semiconductor demand since about the midpoint of 2015, with the company reporting a comparable sales decline (i.e., not including revenue from its merger with Freescale Semiconductor) of minus 8% from the prior-year period in the second quarter. This, along with weaker U.S. GDP growth, is why NXP shares are down about 1% year-to-date while all three major indexes have moved higher. Image source: Getty Images. However, this weakness in NXP's share price is the perfect reason for long-term investors to hit the gas pedal. NXP's primary growth drivers are its high performance mixed signal (HPMS) products, which allow electronic devices to interact with their surroundings. A more common word for NXP's HPMS would be the Internet of Things. NXP's solutions power everything from near-field communication chips found in cellphones, which can transmit financial data to a point-of-sale device, to automotive solutions that aid vehicles in recognizing their surroundings, including lane drifting avoidance. According to Cisco Systems, the global IoT market could be worth $19 trillion, and NXP wants a large chunk of that pie. Speaking of mergers, NXP's combination with Freescale should be a game-changer. Cost synergies from the combination should lead to improved margins, while the combined company's leading position in general purpose microcontroller products, automotive semiconductor solutions, and mobile-based semiconductor solutions could lead to improved pricing leverage when dealing with large customers. As technology becomes more mainstream in our homes and cars, demand for NXP's solutions is likely to increase. This makes NXP's forward P/E of 11 and PEG ratio of 0.4 seem all the more attractive.

Europe's competition boss signals more major US companies could face scrutiny after a US group calls for Apple decision to be overturned. By Liam Tung | September 19, 2016 -- 12:56 GMT (05:56 PDT) | Topic: Tech Industry EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager: "I keep thinking about all the CEOs who just make sure that their companies do pay their taxes. They exist too." Image: Johannes Jansson/Wikimedia Commons Ahead of a meeting with her US counterparts in Washington, Europe's competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, has indicated she may launch investigations into several more major US companies. As reported by Bloomberg, Vestager on Friday said in a tweet that she may scrutinize the tax affairs of US companies linked to Business Roundtable, a group whose members include the CEOs of US firms with collective annual revenues of $7tn. The group published a letter sent to European heads of states, calling for the commission's order for Ireland to recover $14bn in taxes from Apple for alleged illegal state aid to be overturned. The group's members include CEOs of General Electric, JP Morgan Chase, and American Express. From the tech sector, its CEOs include Cisco's Chuck Robbins, Qualcomm's Steve Mollenkopf, Dell Technologies' Michael Dell, IBM's Virgina Rometty, and Oracle's Safra Catz. "In the interest of all countries that respect the rule of law, this decision must not be allowed to stand," wrote John Engler, president of Business Roundtable. "I urge you to work with your colleagues to overturn this decision and seek an end to the use of state aid investigations that override the ability of your country and other EU member states to determine and interpret their own tax laws," he continued. Vestager will on Monday meet US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, who in the wake of the EC's decision against Ireland, said it "reflects an attempt to reach into the US tax base to tax income that out to be taxed in the United States". One day after Engler's letter was published, Davide Serra, CEO Algebris investments, wrote to Vestager on Twitter: "Apple: so in the USA there are 185 CEO which think it's legal to pay 0.05% Taxes in Europe! @vestager pls check what they pay asap!" Vestager replied: "I will. And I keep thinking about all the CEOs who just make sure that their companies do pay their taxes. They exist too." Vestager told German paper Handelsblatt in a story published on Sunday that the EU was within its rights to order Ireland recover taxes from Apple. "It is 100 percent legitimate to tax profit where it is generated," Vestager told the newspaper. "From our perspective, it is irritating when American companies pay less in taxes than European ones."

Continue Reading Below The central bank is expected to leave rates unchanged at the two-day meeting, but investors will assess Fed Chair Janet Yellen's speech on Wednesday for clues on the timing of the next rate hike. The probability of a December move shot up to 70 percent in the past month from 57.5 percent in the previous month, according to a Reuters poll of over 100 economists. The S&P 500 financial index rose 0.97 percent, topping 10 of 11 major sectors trading higher. The index lost 1.3 percent last week, partly due to some Fed officials striking a dovish stance on rates. "The weakness seen last week (in financials) is attracting attention today," said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth. JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo rose more than 1 percent and were the top influences on the S&P. Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT The energy index rose 0.91 percent, recovering from the six-week low it hit last Wednesday, as oil prices climbed more than 2 percent. Investors will also keep an eye on the Bank of Japan's policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, where it is largely expected to not announce further policy easing. At 11:00 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 90.53 points, or 0.5 percent, at 18,214.33, the S&P 500 was up 9.3 points, or 0.43 percent, at 2,148.46 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 13.61 points, or 0.26 percent, at 5,258.17. The dollar index declined 0.38 percent, sending gold prices higher, on dim prospects of a rate increase this week. Traders priced in a 12 percent chance of a rate hike by Wednesday, while the odds jumped to 56 percent for December, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. Sarepta Therapeutics' shares soared 74 percent after the FDA approved its key muscle disorder drug. Casino operator Isle of Capri jumped 31 percent after Eldorado Resorts said it would buy the company for $1.7 billion, including debt. General Motors rose 3 percent after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to "overweight." U.S. electrical components distributor Avnet was up 8.8 percent after it announced the sale of its IT business to tech products distributor Tech Data Corp for about $2.6 billion. Tech Data's stock soared 21 percent. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,427 to 484. On the Nasdaq, 1,938 issues rose and 746 fell. The S&P 500 index showed nine new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 84 new highs and 13 new lows.
