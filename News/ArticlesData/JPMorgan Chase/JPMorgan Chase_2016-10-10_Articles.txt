"Bond valuations are obviously very, very high for various reasons. We have seen contagion into the equity space," he told CNBC's "Power Lunch." That's because investors in search of yield have moved into stocks that pay dividends, causing the market to be "dislocated," he added. At this point, Lakos-Bujas believes diversification makes a lot of sense. However, historically that means investing in both bonds and equities. "Today I think one of the hidden risks that we face is that if yields start to creep higher, especially if they start to creep higher for nongrowth reasons, be it central bank related, you could see bonds potentially getting deflated and you could see equities being pressurized, which means cash." JPMorgan has said it expects the S&P 500 to end the year at 2,000, with market leaders poised for the biggest fall. It also projects some sector laggards to do relatively better, such as health care. "We basically see superior growth in health care, on one hand. On the other hand, we see relatively attractive valuations," Lakos-Bujas said. — CNBC's Tom DiChristopher contributed to this report.

That's the amount of investment the global financial services firm gave to the LiftUp loan program, which aims to reduce approval times for small business loans, help small businesses grow and dent unemployment rates, the firm said Tuesday. "Increasing access to capital is vital to the success of small businesses -- and to the economic growth of our communities," JPMorgan Chase credit risk director for Central Texas Ken Sample said in a statement. "It's also a key component of JPMorgan Chase's commitment to help women-, minority- and veteran-owned business grow, gain access to capital and create jobs," said Sample, who also is a board member of LiftFund, a San Antonio-based small business support organization. "That's why we are proud to expand our partnership with LiftFund to help close this funding gap for the small businesses that need it most." The program targets businesses in Houston, Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, New Orleans and San Antonio. Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Walmart Video Gaming Rollback Sale Deals from $2 + free...

The search for sustainable dividend payers in an unpredictable market By Clare Hart, Portfolio Manager for JPMorgan Equity Income Fund at J.P.

Why does an income-oriented approach make sense in today’s environment? Dividend investing is an attractive way to capture return throughout the market cycle. If you’re investing for the long term, you should consider stocks with both growth in their underlying business and an above-market dividend yield. We have found that, over time, this combination allows an investor to capture both sources of a stock’s return—capital appreciation and dividend income. Today’s steady economic backdrop, with the potential for a bounce in corporate profits this year, is a great environment for a stock picker to identify attractively-valued companies that can grow their business. Where are you currently finding your most attractive opportunities? Some of our highest-conviction positions are financial stocks, where reduced expectations for interest rate hikes this year are creating bargains by causing investors to exit names in the sector. Across the banking industry we’re finding opportunities across both large banks and regional banks. A regional bank we particularly like is BB&T, BBT 1.0381458232737808% BB&T Corp. U.S.: NYSE USD41.85 0.43 1.0381458232737808% /Date(1478901744626-0600)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 9990179 AFTER HOURS USD41.85 % Volume (Delayed 15m) : 207092 P/E Ratio 15.5 Market Cap 33958093631.8603 Dividend Yield 2.867383512544803% Rev. per Employee 298011 More quote details and news » BBT in Your Value Your Change Short position a southern-focused franchise with a high dividend yield. BB&T maintains a diversified business model on a product and a geographical basis, which should reduce earnings volatility, while it has augmented its organic growth with well-thought-out acquisitions that complement its existing geographic footprint. As a result, BB&T is focusing on growing its franchise in states with steady population growth, such as Florida and Texas, while expanding into new markets in the south and Midwest. We’re also finding pockets of opportunity within high dividend-yielding sectors, such as consumer staples, utilities and REITs. However, valuations are rich, payout ratios are higher, and growth opportunities for the businesses tend to be lower. Therefore, the potential total return from investing in companies with attractive dividend yields and lower payout ratios, such as financials, is much better. Our focus on identifying stocks with a modest payout ratio is a key part of our investment process, as these companies retain enough capital after paying dividends to invest for future growth, providing us with both a growing stream of dividends and capital appreciation potential. How are you finding value in volatile sectors? In more volatile sectors, such as energy, we focus on seeking out companies that can return capital to shareholders throughout the cycle. For example, we like to own high-quality established names, such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron, which have strong balance sheets and can survive the persistent volatility in the oil market, while also being in a position to benefit when oil prices eventually stabilize. Industrials is another volatile sector, where we are able to find high-quality companies that operate in longer cycle, higher value-add industries. Companies like 3M and Honeywell—which are able to deliver products with technological advances into more traditionally-cyclical end markets—can be longer-term winners. Why should investors consider this high-quality approach to value investing? In today’s market, which we believe will strengthen as the year goes on and as we move into next year, it’s an ideal environment to seek out companies that can grow their business and add shareholder value. And an investment approach that blends income investing with capital appreciation can not only seek out these attractive opportunities, but also lead to a fund with lower volatility than the broader market.

US citizen Joshua Samuel Aaron, wanted in the US for stealing data on 100 million clients of the JPMorgan Chase bank, has asked for political asylum in Russia only to see his request turned down, a source in the law enforcement has told TASS. Read also Moscow says US threats of sanctions for 'cyberattacks' are provocative "The US national in question, currently at a special detention center for foreign nationals pending deportation, has asked Russia for political asylum. In his home country he is faced with a 170-year prison term. His request has been turned down, but he has protested the ruling, so now the decision in favor of his deportation has been suspended until courts pronounce the final verdict regarding his request and the decision takes effect," the source explained. Shortly after his detention Aaron started complaining about his health problems, but the court found that the presented documentary evidence was not convincing enough. Earlier on Tuesday Bloomberg said that Aaron, whom the United States holds responsible for a cyberattack against JPMorgan Chase, is kept in custody at a detention center for illegal migrants in Moscow and is negotiating his return home. The agency said Aaron’s lawyers and the US authorities might come to terms by the end of this month. Aaron has dismissed the cyberattack charges. He declared he knew nothing about the warrant for his arrest issued in the United States. His relatives have confirmed the very instance of negotiations but would not elaborate. Detention and deportation decision The Moscow police detained Joshua Aaron in May 2016, when in the process of an ID check he failed to present a valid passport. He had arrived in Russia from Ukraine on May 23, 2015, several weeks before the issue of a warrant for his arrest in the United States.

The court fined him 5,000 rubles (roughly $80) and ordered expulsion. He was taken to a detention center for foreign nationals until the expulsion decision would take effect. Police detained Aaron in the center of Moscow. He carried no passport, migration card or visa (his previous six-month visa had expired by then). On June 2 the Moscow City Court turned down his appeal and upheld the deportation decision. Bloomberg on Tuesday said that according to investigators Joshua Aaron and Israeli citizens Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein before October 2014 carried out a number of cyberattacks against JPMorgan chase to steal data on more than 100 million clients. On the list of the fraudsters’ victims were a number of financial companies in New York, Boston (Massachusetts), Omaha (Nebraska) and St. Louis (Missouri). The stolen data allowed the hackers to get unauthorized access to bank accounts. Shalon and Orenstein were detained in Israel last summer and extradited to the United States. JPMorgan Chase earlier said the cyberattack against its systems was one of the worst in the whole history of the United States. President Barack Obama pledged to personally monitor progress in the investigation, media said. {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Topics Foreign policy Top News November 14, 8:26 Russian military to perform observation flight over US November 14, 8:26 November 14, 9:01 Czech PM calls initiatives to deploy US radar in republic 'pure fiction' November 14, 9:01 November 13, 16:17 Foreign ministry’s spokeswoman translates Stoltenberg into "comprehensible" language November 13, 16:17 November 14, 8:30 Socialist leader wins presidential election in Moldova November 14, 8:30 In other media Реклама Photo 4 Crimea’s ex-prosecutor Poklonskaya takes helm at State Duma’s Commission on MPs’ income 4 Putin: Uzbek people can count on Russia’s support 3 Russia's Kirov Region governor detained on suspicion of taking €0.4 mln bribe Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Russia’s state defense order in 2015 Chinese Lunar Exploration Program Russia’s Angara A5 heavy-load space carrier rocket Most read Now Today This week 1 Socialist leader wins presidential election in Moldova 2 Russian military to perform observation flight over US 3 Russian MP slams Kiev's attempt to deny Crimea supplies gas to Ukrainian town 4 Foreign ministry’s spokeswoman translates Stoltenberg into "comprehensible" language 5 Formidable Sarmat: Satan’s successor that can pierce any defense 6 Press review: Moscow's aid to Kurdistan and cyber-threats for Russian defense sector 7 Best shots of 'Slavic Brotherhood' joint drills 1 Foreign ministry’s spokeswoman translates Stoltenberg into "comprehensible" language 2 Erdogan says protests in US only temporary 3 Crimea to supply gas to Ukraine’s town till March - legislator 4 Karjakin-Carlsen Game 2 ends in draw 5 International military drills 'Slavic Brotherhood' closed near Belgrade 6 Putin reiterates Russian Armed Forces not threatening anybody 7 Russia to attend talks with OPEC on November 26-28 - Novak 1 Dutch sub tried to approach Russian aircraft carrier in Mediterranean — defense ministry 2 Trump elected president of the United States — live coverage 3 Source: 16 US servicemen killed, 27 injured in fighting for Iraq’s Mosul 4 Putin congratulates Donald Trump on winning US presidential election 5 Russia-US discord will leave with Obama administration: lawmakers' reaction to Trump's win 6 US election results in animated graphics 7 Foreign ministry’s spokeswoman translates Stoltenberg into "comprehensible" language TOP STORIES US presidential election 2016 Conflict in Syria Russia's defense industry Oil & Gas Industry Space programs Реклама News World Russian Politics & Diplomacy Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

Some of our highest-conviction positions are financial stocks, where reduced expectations for interest rate hikes this year are creating bargains by causing investors to exit names in the sector. Across the banking industry we’re finding opportunities across both large banks and regional banks. A regional bank we particularly like is BB&T, BBT 1.0381458232737808% BB&T Corp. U.S.: NYSE USD41.85 0.43 1.0381458232737808% /Date(1478901744626-0600)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 9990179 AFTER HOURS USD41.85 % Volume (Delayed 15m) : 207092 P/E Ratio 15.5 Market Cap 33958093631.8603 Dividend Yield 2.867383512544803% Rev. per Employee 298011 More quote details and news » BBT in Your Value Your Change Short position a southern-focused franchise with a high dividend yield. BB&T maintains a diversified business model on a product and a geographical basis, which should reduce earnings volatility, while it has augmented its organic growth with well-thought-out acquisitions that complement its existing geographic footprint. As a result, BB&T is focusing on growing its franchise in states with steady population growth, such as Florida and Texas, while expanding into new markets in the south and Midwest. We’re also finding pockets of opportunity within high dividend-yielding sectors, such as consumer staples, utilities and REITs. However, valuations are rich, payout ratios are higher, and growth opportunities for the businesses tend to be lower. Therefore, the potential total return from investing in companies with attractive dividend yields and lower payout ratios, such as financials, is much better. Our focus on identifying stocks with a modest payout ratio is a key part of our investment process, as these companies retain enough capital after paying dividends to invest for future growth, providing us with both a growing stream of dividends and capital appreciation potential. How are you finding value in volatile sectors? In more volatile sectors, such as energy, we focus on seeking out companies that can return capital to shareholders throughout the cycle. For example, we like to own high-quality established names, such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron, which have strong balance sheets and can survive the persistent volatility in the oil market, while also being in a position to benefit when oil prices eventually stabilize. Industrials is another volatile sector, where we are able to find high-quality companies that operate in longer cycle, higher value-add industries. Companies like 3M and Honeywell—which are able to deliver products with technological advances into more traditionally-cyclical end markets—can be longer-term winners. Why should investors consider this high-quality approach to value investing? In today’s market, which we believe will strengthen as the year goes on and as we move into next year, it’s an ideal environment to seek out companies that can grow their business and add shareholder value. And an investment approach that blends income investing with capital appreciation can not only seek out these attractive opportunities, but also lead to a fund with lower volatility than the broader market. With its income approach to equities focusing on high-quality companies with healthy and sustainable dividend yields, learn more about how JPMorgan Equity Income Fund can boost returns in today’s challenging environment.

Joshua Aaron is the only American of a trio indicted in July 2015 for pump-and-dump schemes said to have made them millions of dollars. They’re accused of making their fortune by artificially inflating the price of penny stocks by spamming out promotional emails and then selling their shares. It’s believed that the group were involved in hacking JPMorgan and other Wall Street firms for info they could use to make their schemes more effective. Investigators had originally suspected Russian involvement in the JPMorgan attack and Aaron and former Florida State University classmate, Anthony Murgio, are known to have traveled there frequently. Now Bloomberg is reporting that Aaron, 32, was detained back in May after breaking the rules of his three-year visa. His lawyers are now in talks with US prosecutors, although Russia has no extradition treaty with the States so presumably if deported he could leave for another country. The situation highlights the problem US officials have in dealing with Russia when it comes to cybersecurity matters. The diplomatic relationship between the two could be described as ‘frosty’ at best, despite an agreement struck between presidents Obama and Putin to co-operate against cybercriminals. That’s not been helped by Washington’s assertion that Russia has been behind attempts to destabilize the country’s electoral process ahead of the presidential showdown next month. It’s more than likely that there are members of Aaron’s group that are Russian nationals – another reason for the Kremlin to be reluctant to co-operate in this case. By contrast, Aaron’s alleged co-conspirators Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein were arrested by Israeli police last summer and extradited to New York in July this year.

JPMorgan’s funds dominate trade, attracting 90pc of mainland investment flows PUBLISHED : Tuesday, 11 October, 2016, 9:48am UPDATED : Tuesday, 11 October, 2016, 10:57pm Comments:   Enoch Yiu enoch.yiu@scmp.com http://twitter.com/enochyiu Share PrintEmail Related topics Chinese Offshore Investment Related Articles Companies China’s private equity funds lead the charge into European and American markets 3 Nov 2016 Economy How Chinese buyers are soothing fears amid record spree of overseas deals 24 Oct 2016 Economy Chinese investors upbeat on prospects in Thailand despite uncertainty after king’s death 18 Oct 2016 Hong Kong domiciled funds have turned out to be wildly popular with mainland investors, who snatched up 80 times more of the investments than Hong Kong investors purchased of a reciprocal product that provides access to mainland equity markets, data for the first eight months of a new cross-border programme showed. Mainlanders channelled 8.45 billion yuan (HK$9.86 billion) to buy Hong Kong fund products on offer in the mainland over the January to August period, according to figures released by China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). The sum is 80 times the 104.59 million yuan that Hongkongers channelled into mainland funds products sold in the city. This is despite the rich offering of mainland investment products on offer in Hong Kong, as 42 mainland funds have been approved for distribution by the Securities and Futures Commission. Meanwhile, only six Hong Kong investment funds have been approved for distribution in China by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. The cross border fund sales are part of the mutual recognition scheme which started in January. JPMorgan Asset Management has won the lion’s share of the fund sales to mainland investors, receiving 7.6 billion yuan of investments through the marketing of two funds, one focused on Asian equities and the other on Asian bonds. “Hong Kong funds are popular among mainlanders as they want to invest in international products to diversify their risk,” JPMorgan’s head of China retail business Henry Tong said. He credited an effective distribution network as key to the success of the products. JPMorgan’s mainland joint venture distributes the funds through 12 mainland banks, online platforms, in addition to individual brokers. Beijing, Shanghahi, Guangzhou and second tier cities such as Chengdu are covered as part of the marketing umbrella. “Basically, we found mainlanders want to invest in fund products with a balance risk level and they want the funds invested in a number of markets to diversify risk,” Tong said. Tong said an application has been filed to gain distribution approval for a third fund offering Asian high yield equity. Although the stock connect between Hong Kong and Shanghai launched in 2014 could allow investors cross border access, Tong said it would not compete with the cross border fund scheme. Meanwhile, Hang Seng Bank said its cross-border sales of an index fund that tracks the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index has been well received. “We are happy with the sales,” Hang Seng Bank executive director Andrew Fung said without providing a sales figure. “The north bounds offer more diversification as it has bond funds, actively managed equity funds and index funds.” “The southbound funds are not too different from existing R-QFII and A-share ETFs. Falling bond yields and weak A-share performance also account for the slow sales of mainland products. The trend may persists for some time until A-shares do better,” Fung said. JPMorgan’s mainland joint venture has three mainland funds sold in Hong Kong. Elisa Ng Ka-li, head of intermediary business of JPMorgan Asset Management, said most of the southbound funds are invested in domestic mainland equities which is different from the northbound funds which offer diversification across different asset classes and geographical regions. “Given that China’s domestic equities tend to be more volatile and momentum driven, Hong Kong investors are in general sceptical towards A-shares, especially when the market for the past few months has been range bound,” Ng said. “We believe once the A-share markets regain momentum and the sentiment towards domestic A-shares improves, sales of mainland funds will gain more traction,” Ng said. Stewart Aldcroft, chairman of Cititrust, said the sales show the appeal of the funds offered by Hong Kong fund managers is far greater than those offered by mainland managers. “It is widely believed that the CSRC is slowing the processing of funds from Hong Kong for approval in China, as they fear the volumes would be even greater, possibly exceeding their expectations for the initial stages of mutual fund recognition,” Aldcroft said. “The local fund management industry would like the SFC to be far more vocal to the CSRC in moving forward on approving funds, thus to provide some help to have a wider choice of funds sold in the market,” he said. Hong Kong Investment Funds Association chief executive Sally Wong said mainland investors have limited choices when it comes to investing in overseas markets, so it’s natural for them to snap up Hong Kong funds. “Currently, mainlanders can only either put their money in savings deposits, or at the other end, A-shares or property,” Wong said.

(NYSE: CRM), which it terms as the most valuable cloud asset. Analyst Mark Murphy said conversations with more than a dozen industry contacts reinforce his confidence in the favorable long-term outlook for the company. The positive opinion is premised on a trio of factors. Demand Going From Strength To Strength JPMorgan noted that partners see no sense of a drop in demand, with some even suggesting tremendous traction. The partners estimate an ongoing 20–30 percent growth trajectory, the firm noted. Einstein Feedback Positive The firm also stated that feedback on the company's news AI product "Einstein" is positive. This, according to the firm, will give salesforce.com controlling interest in some really interesting data. Related Link: Twitter Keeps Fluttering As More Bidders Lose Interest Lightning Bolt = Bright JPMorgan also highlighted the stronger than expected demand for Lightning Bolt and the combination of communities and demandware. Entry Point The firm sees the weakness created by the soft fiscal second quarter and a potentially expensive acquisition of Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) as an opportune entry point. JP Morgan expects the overhangs to fade away with a better pace of business in the third and fourth quarters and an eventual departure from the current Twitter discussion. Rating, Price Target Reiterated While noting that salesforce.com is trading near the bottom of its typical trading range of 5–8x of EV/sales, JPMorgan said it believes its long-term thesis that the company is one of the rare cloud assets with a multi-product success story and a long-term share gainer remains intact. As such, the firm reiterated its Overweight ratings and $95 price target on the shares of the company. At the time of writing, the shares of salesforce.com were up 6.07 percent at $75.19.

"It is my personal opinion that Brexit made the chances of the Eurozone not surviving in the next decade five times higher," JPMorgan Chase head Jamie Dimon said during an annual meeting of the Institute of International Finance in Washington. He was echoed by Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, who linked Brexit-related issues to the problem of the European Union's survival. At the same time, he warned that the British referendum's results would have "broader long-term consequences". "Brexit is an alert signal indicating that the EU should change, but everyone is busy with their own problems and this complicates the situation," according to Chase Vittorio Grilli, former Italian Finance Minister and the current head of JP Morgan Chase's  European division.  I think people sometimes forget the importance of the Eurozone to the UK economy #Brexit #Trade #liamfox pic.twitter.com/GKcdgKVA0B — Ryan Boothroyd (@BoothroydRyan) 29 сентября 2016 г.

Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem, for his part, said earlier this month that the EU-British agreement on the UK leaving the bloc will be a tough deal as Brussels is going to protect the integrity of the internal market, which implies retaining all four freedoms including the freedom of movement.

In July, French Finance Minister Michel Sapin said that the UK's decision to leave the European Union called for closer integration within the 19-nation euro area to curb economic fallout.

On June 23, the nationwide referendum on EU membership was held in the United Kingdom, in which 51.9 percent of voters said the country should leave the bloc.

I thought owing to when Soros made £billions, on Black Wednesday, we could not join the Eurozone?

Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are all expected to report earnings before the market open on Friday. Trader David Seaburg said that the quarterly results from the banks actually don't matter as much as a looming rate hike from the Federal Reserve. He said, if anything, the expectations for the sector are very low right now. Seaburg said he would rather hold onto the bank stocks right now and then take off profits when the Fed raises its benchmark federal funds rate. Trader Pete Najarian agreed and said he is holding positions in Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. He also said that JPMorgan Chase has been a very resilient stock in the banking sector. Trader Dan Nathan said he's not certain the risk-reward "is really there" in the financials. Trader Guy Adami thinks U.S. Bancorp is a more stable name in the sector that is still trading near its 52-week high of $44.58. The stock closed at $43.29 on Tuesday.

(AP) BILL PETERS 10/12/2016 Reprints With JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) set to report third-quarter earnings on Friday, the landscape for the big banks has enough in common with what we saw in Q2. In other words, the Fed still opted not to raise interest rates, hurting the banks' net interest margins. The state of the U.S. consumer remained generally solid. And the global "economic uncertainty?" That was still there too. "During the third quarter, banks faced another challenging operating environment, with uncertainty and volatility arising after the Brexit vote and lackluster global economic growth continued," Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a research note. The only good news some analysts see is no bad news. "Unfortunately, the positive might come in just not having any negatives," Edward Jones analyst Shannon Stemm said. But Citigroup last month cited better trading in Q3 but weaker-than-anticipated investment banking, while JPMorgan remained upbeat on the economy and the state of the consumer. Other factors will be likely to dominate the financial world's attention. Many observers will likely be cued into any commentary surrounding Wells Fargo's cross-selling scandal — in which authorities said the bank's employees created as many as 2 million unauthorized consumer accounts to hit sales targets. The scandal has cost John Stumpf his job as CEO and chairman. The bank said late Wednesday COO Tim Sloan is taking over as CEO and Stephen Sanger is taking over as chair. The Wall Street Journal reported that the bank outlined plans to rebound from the scandal during a conference call on Monday. Details from those plans could be presented on Friday. The scandal over the bank's cross-selling, a point of pride for management only a few years ago, led to some intense questioning from Congress about the bank's culture and executives' knowledge of the sales practices. The financial impact during Q3, however, was limited. Wall Street expects Wells Fargo's earnings per share to fall 4% to $1.01. Revenue is seen rising 1.5% to $22.2 billion. "The investment community's going to be looking for some specifics from the management team on what they're going to do to adjust sales practices, and what's that going to look like from a cost standpoint?" Stemm said. "And then I think there will be follow-ons to some of the other banks, too – 'What do your sales practices look like? What are you doing to monitor both risky behavior?' What does that look like for future compliance costs?" Beyond cross-selling, KBW expects Wells' net interest margins to be constrained, even after the bank grew loans considerably in quarters past. JPMorgan, another bank KBW said was dependent on loan growth after activity rose rapidly in recent quarters, is expected to report EPS down 17% to $1.39. The bank's equity markets could be a bright spot, KBW said. Revenue is expected to climb 2% to $23.988 billion. Citigroup's EPS, meanwhile, is expected to fall 15% to $1.15, with revenue down 6% to $17.344. Citigroup in June also acquired Costco's (COST) U.S. co-brand credit-card portfolio from American Express (AXP). Citi and Costco announced their co-branded credit-card deal last March. "(Q3) will be the first full quarter with Costco in the numbers and management has already indicated that the performance within the Costco portfolio is exceeding management's expectations," Kleinhanzl wrote. "If Citi can show material growth in receivables from the Costco portfolio then we would expect shares of Citigroup to do well at earnings." KBW also said Citigroup may have gotten more of a bump from fixed income, currencies and commodities trading. But the bank has said that investment banking during the quarter was "lighter than estimated." JPMorgan dipped 0.3% in the stock market today, while Citigroup lost 0.6% and Wells Fargo eased 0.3%. Bank of America (BAC) fell 0.5%. Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 0.8%, while Goldman Sachs (GS) added 0.15%. IBD'S TAKE: While U.S. banking giants face tighter restrictions from regulators, their stronger capital positions have helped them take market share from European rivals, who have yet to fully recover from the financial crisis. Bank stocks have rallied in recent weeks as the Fed has shown more openness to raising interest rates. Other factors could extend their gains, Morgan Stanley notes. That uptrend for the banks "could continue if oil prices edge higher, inflation picks up, Yellen raises rates, corporates re-engage," Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck wrote in a research note. "Risks include a divided government post-election, weak C&I growth, and political backlash." Other risks for the banks include commercial lending, which KBW expects to weaken after the U.K.'s vote in June to leave the European Union caused businesses to put plans on hold, which in turn meant less borrowing. Bank of America reports Monday, Goldman reports next Tuesday, and Morgan Stanley reports on Wednesday. IBD's money center banking industry group, where most of the major banks are, was ranked 131st out of 197 groups on Tuesday. It has been in the bottom half of the table for many months.

"As we've seen the stabilization in commodity markets, as we've seen stabilization in the dollar, I think that sets you up for a much more productive outlook for both emerging market growth and for emerging market earnings," Parker told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Tuesday.

"If you want to lower savings and boost growth, you actually raise interest rates a little bit," said Matus, deputy chief United States economist at UBS. Matus also told CNBC that low, stagnant growth does not necessarily indicate an oncoming recession. He said one of most frequent questions he gets from clients is where in the economic cycle is the U.S. economy and how close the country is to a recession. Matus' take: "We've got low growth but it's very stable growth, and so we are nowhere close to a recession at this point."

The release of quarterly results from Alcoa is seen as the unofficial start of earnings season, with financial giants Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) due to report their results later this week. Overall trading activity may be somewhat subdued, however, as some traders may stay on the sidelines amid a lack of major U.S. economic data. The minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting and reports on retail sales and producer prices are likely to attract attention in the coming days. U.S. stocks closed Monday's session higher amid a rally in crude oil prices. The major averages opened higher and moved roughly sideways until early afternoon trading. After giving back some of their gains over the remainder of the session, the averages ended moderately higher. The Dow Industrials added 88.55 points or 0.49 percent before ending at 18,329, the S&P 500 Index ended up 9.92 points or 0.46 percent at 2,164 and the Nasdaq Composite closed at 5,329, up 36.27 points or 0.69 percent. Eighteen of the thirty Dow components ended the session higher and four stocks were little changed, while the remaining eight stocks retreated. Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Boeing (BA), Merck (MRK) and Apple (AAPL) were among the biggest gainers of the session, but Procter & Gamble (PG) and Wal-Mart (WMT) fell sharply. Among the sectors, energy, banking, airline and telecom stocks turned in some of the best performances on the day. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures for November delivery are slipping $0.34 to $51.01 a barrel after ending Monday's session up $1.54 at $51.35 a barrel, the highest closing level since July 15th, 2015. Meanwhile, an ounce of gold is currently trading at $1,258, down $2.40 from the previous session's close of $1,260.40. On Monday, gold rose $8.90, snapping a 6-session losing streak. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 103.64 yen compared to the 103.61 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Monday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1090 compared to yesterday's $1.1139. Asia The Asian markets closed mixed, with the Singapore, South Korean, Taiwanese and Hong Kong markets declining, while the rest of the markets advanced. The Indian market was closed for a public holiday. The Japanese market, which opened after Monday's public holiday, advanced as the yen remained weak. The Nikkei 225 Index opened higher and rose steadily in the morning. Although there was a slight loss of momentum by the mid-session, the index consolidated in the afternoon, closing up 164.67 points or 0.98 percent at a more than 1-month high of 17,025. Food, chemical, pharma, export, utility, telecom and most resource stocks gained ground, while some housing, real estate, steel, financial and retail stocks came under selling pressure. Australia's All Ordinaries Index ended modestly higher, although well off its best levels. The index ended at 5,562, up 6.70 points or 0.12 percent. Energy and material stocks rallied strongly and consumer and utility stocks saw moderate strength, but most other sectors lost ground. China's Shanghai Composite Index closed 17.11 points or 0.56 percent higher at 3,065, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surrendered all its morning gains by early afternoon trading and languished below the unchanged line thereafter. The index ended down 302.30 points or 1.27 percent at 23,550. On the economic front, the results of a survey by National Australia Bank showed that confidence among businesses in Australia was unchanged in September. The corresponding index was static at 6, although above the expected reading of 5. The business conditions index rose 1 point to 8. A report released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that the total number of home loans issued in Australia fell 3 percent month-over-month in August. This was steeper than the 1.5 percent drop expected by economists. This follows a 4.5 percent drop in July. Investment lending edged up 0.1 percent. Data released by the Ministry of Finance showed that Japan's current account surplus came in at 2.0 trillion yen in August, more than the 1.5 trillion yen expected by economists and the 1.94 trillion-yen surplus in July. The trade surplus was also wider than expected at 243.2 billion yen, as exports fell 9.6 percent and imports declined a steeper 18.3 percent. Europe European stocks are holding up despite a volatile morning session. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has inched up by 0.1 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index are both up by 0.2 percent. On the economic front, German investor sentiment climbed at a faster-than-expected pace in October to its highest level in four months, the results of a survey by the Centre for European Economic Research/ZEW showed. The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment rose to 6.2 from 0.5 in each of the previous two months. Economists had expected a score of 4. The latest reading was the strongest since June's 19.2. Data released by the British Retail Consortium showed that like-for-like sales in the U.K. rose 0.4 percent year-over-year in September, belying expectations for a 0.3 percent drop. U.S. Economic Reports There are no market moving economic reports due for the day. Stocks in Focus Shares of Alcoa are moving lower in pre-market trading after the aluminum giant reported third quarter earnings and revenues that came in below analyst estimates. Rent-A-Center- (RCII) may also come under pressure after warning of much weaker than expected third quarter earnings. Illumina (ILMN) pre-announced third quarter revenues of about $607 million, a 10 percent increase year-over-year but below the company's guidance of $625 million to $630 million. The company attributed the shortfall to a larger than expected decline in high throughput sequencing instruments. Coca-Cola (KO) announced that it intends to buy Anheuser-Busch Inbev's (BUD) stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa following the closing of the ABI combination with SABMiller. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America These Companies Are Sitting On Mountains Of Cash Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America Continental Stock Dips On Weak Q3 Profit; Sees Strong Earnings In Q4 AstraZeneca Q3 Pre-tax Profit Down On Crestor Generic; Backs FY View Alphabet Cancels Drone Deal With Starbucks As Project Leaders Pushed Out Viacom Q4 Adj.

M&T still top bank in share By ANNE SAUNDERS • October 7, 2016 Canandaigua National Bank continues to build local market share, this year jumping past JPMorgan Chase & Co. to take the second spot behind M&T Bank Corp. M&T Bank Corp. held onto its top spot in the latest listing of market share for the Rochester metropolitan statistical area, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., but this year its deposits of $4 billion and market share of 24 percent showed no sign of growth compared with 2015. Market share and total deposits for all the banks were measured as of June 30. “The FDIC report is a one-day snapshot, and it reflects all deposits at an institution,” noted Daniel Burns, president of M&T’s Rochester division, adding “there’s a lot of noise inside these numbers.” “That being said, we don’t manage to the FDIC report, or any other report. We focus on understanding what’s important to our customers and communities and serving our customer needs every day. If you look beyond deposits, which is just one aspect of the business, our lending to local small businesses has increased significantly this year,” Burns said. JPMorgan Chase, which was second in market share, fell to third, dropping from 13.3 percent a year ago to 11.1 percent this year with local deposits that fell from $2.2 billion to $1.86 billion. The bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile Canandaigua National Bank and Trust Co. continued to make gradual inroads, growing its market share from 11.1 percent a year ago to 11.7 percent this year and deposits from $1.8 billion in 2015 to $1.95 billion. President and CEO Frank Hamlin said there is no overriding explanation beyond the steady and solid work of a lot of great employees at CNB. “We really are the bank of the community, and the community is coming to bank with us, and that’s reflected in the numbers,” said Lawrence Heilbronner, executive vice president and chief financial officer. Citizens Financial Group Inc.’s Citizens Bank N.A. was No. 4 with a 9.4 percent market share and local deposits of $1.6 billion, roughly the same as last year. The 2016 data do not reflect the merger of First Niagara Financial Group Inc.’s First Niagara Bank and KeyCorp’s KeyBank. First Niagara is No. 5 on the list with 8.7 percent of market share and deposits in this market of $1.46 billion, up from 8.4 percent in 2015 and $1.4 billion. KeyBank, No. 6, also grew its local market share from 6.5 percent in 2015 to 6.8 percent this year and $1.14 billion in deposits in 2016, compared with $1.1 billion in 2015. If the merged banks hang onto their combined deposits, KeyBank would appear next year in the second slot, assuming nothing major changes for the other banks on the list. The rest of the top 10 are:  Financial Institutions Inc.’s Five Star Bank at No. 7 with 5.9 percent—up from 5.8 percent in 2015—and $994 million in deposits locally;  Bank of America N.A. at No. 8 with 5.1 percent—up from 4.7 percent in 2015—and $848 million;  Lyons National Bank at No. 9 with 4.5 percent—up from nearly 4 percent in 2015—and $758 million; and  Community Bank N.A. at No. 10 with 3.85 percent—up from 3.8 percent with an increase in deposits from $627 million to $645 million. Total deposits for the 21 institutions that are part of the Rochester metropolitan statistical area have been steadily on the rise since 2012, reaching $16.8 billion in 2016. M&T Bank has topped the market share list for five years straight, ever since HSBC Bank USA sold its Upstate New York and southern Connecticut branches to First Niagara in 2012. 10/7/2016 (c) 2016 Rochester Business Journal.

Joshua Aaron Source: FBI Joshua Aaron, a Maryland native who attended Florida State University, has been held at a facility for illegal immigrants outside Moscow since failing to show police a valid passport during a midnight check at his apartment above the Beverly Hills Diner near downtown in May, court records show. He and two Israelis are suspected of perpetrating what U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara called “securities fraud on cyber steroids” from 2007 to mid-2015. They’re accused of stealing data on more than 100 million customers from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and other companies, using it in schemes such as stock manipulation that generated hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit gains. Along the way, members of the ring tried to extract nonpublic information from financial corporations, processed payment information for fake pharmaceuticals and fake anti-virus software, falsified passports and took control of a New Jersey credit union, prosecutors say. They used 75 companies and bank and brokerage accounts around the world to launder money, authorities allege. Mystery Hacker But one mystery of the case has remained: While Aaron, 32, and the two Israelis are described as the architects of a global cyber criminal enterprise, the identity of the hacker behind it all has remained unknown. Aaron’s frequent trips to Russia during the time the alleged schemes took place raises the possibility that he may have met in person with the hacker, who is believed to be Russian or Russian-speaking. His cooperation in the case could provide new insight into the country’s cyber underworld at a moment when U.S. officials are publicly accusing Russia of trying to destabilize the American elections with state-sponsored hacks. For a Q&A on cybersecurity, click here A Russian judge on May 20 ordered Aaron deported and fined him 5,000 rubles ($80) for violating the rules of his three-year visa, which requires holders to exit and re-enter the country every six months. Aaron arrived via Ukraine on May 23, 2015 -- just weeks before the U.S. issued arrest warrants for him and co-defendants Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein. A second judge rejected his appeal of the deportation ruling in June 2016. Russian Reciprocity Aaron applied for a refugee status early June, according to court documents. The argument for the request was that he would be subject to a disproportionate punishment in the U.S., according to people with knowledge of the petition. Russian authorities declined the request and Aaron submitted an appeal that is still being reviewed, these people said. In a statement to Russian prosecutors on the day of his detention, Aaron said he wasn’t aware of the arrest warrant issued about a year earlier and denied breaking any U.S. laws. Russia, which doesn’t extradite its citizens or have an extradition treaty with the U.S., offered to hand him over in exchange for a “reciprocal” act, but received no reply from the U.S. Embassy, according to court transcripts. He is presumably free to leave Russia for a county of his choice. Talks between Aaron’s lawyers and U.S. officials are progressing and a deal paving the way for his return home, where he would be subject to immediate arrest, may be reached this month, the people familiar with the matter said. Aaron’s parents, who live in Potomac, Maryland, didn’t respond to a request for comment and it’s not clear who is serving as Aaron’s lawyer in the U.S. Aaron declined to comment via his Moscow lawyer, Ashot Muradyan. Snowden, Putin Russia has a history of sheltering alleged criminals actively sought by Washington, particularly now that disputes from Ukraine to Syria and U.S. accusations of Russian hacking have driven relations to a post-Cold War low. Edward Snowden, the NSA whistle-blower who was lauded by President Vladimir Putin for disclosing mass surveillance programs, lives comfortably in Russia, as does Semion Mogilevich, who spent years on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted list for being “the most dangerous mobster in the world.” For a Q&A on hacking U.S. elections, click here The U.S. Embassy in Moscow and James Margolin, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan, declined to comment, as did Russian Interior Ministry officials. Kelly Langmesser, a spokeswoman for the FBI in New York, said Aaron wasn’t presently in U.S. custody and declined to comment further. Ilya Sachkov, head of Moscow-based cyberforensics firm Group-IB, called Aaron’s case particularly "strange," the first one he knows of involving a U.S. citizen accused of cybercrime who was then detained in Russia. “Naturally, he is not alone, and his group most probably includes Russian citizens,” Sachkov said. "Putin and Obama agreed to cooperate against cybercriminals. This case doesn’t look like there is any cooperation." Fidelity, E*Trade While Russia may consider Aaron little more than a bit player in its contentious relationship with Washington, he may have substantial value for U.S. prosecutors, allowing them to push their case deeper into Russia’s underground. One court document identifies a co-conspirator in the scheme as “a computer hacker who is believed to have resided in Russia.” Two people familiar with the case say his identity is known to U.S. officials and describe him as highly skilled. Aside from JPMorgan, companies that have confirmed being attacked by Aaron’s group include Fidelity Investments Ltd., E*Trade Financial Corp., Scottrade Financial Services Inc. and Dow Jones & Co., a unit of News Corp. Aaron, who has been living in Russia with his Israeli wife, speaks only a few words of Russian. During his immigration proceedings, the court hired an interpreter for Aaron but he couldn’t translate "administrative code violation," according to people who were in the courtroom. If Aaron does return to the U.S, he’ll join his alleged co-conspirators. Israeli authorities detained Shalon and Orenstein within a month of the arrest warrants being issued in the summer of 2015 and extradited them to New York this July.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 10, 2016 10:00am   Comments Share: Related TSN Worst Performing Industries For November 9, 2016 Tyson Foods A 'Hold' After Recent Rebound: Vetr Tyson Foods, Inc. (NYSE: TSN) shares were down 8.9 percent on Friday following a complaint of alleged collusion among chicken producers. Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation (NASDAQ: PPC) and Sanderson Farms, Inc. (NASDAQ: SAFM) shares also sold off more than 4 percent each on the news. JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman doesn’t believe the complaint will ultimately have much of an impact on the companies mentioned above. Instead, he believes that much of Tyson’s Friday selloff can be attributed to a Pivotal downgrade on Friday. The firm cut Tyson’s rating from Buy to Sell. JPMorgan, on the other hand, maintains its Neutral rating for Tyson. Related Link: Tyson Foods Doesn't Like Being Sued Or Downgraded “At this time, there seems to be insufficient evidence in the complaint, in our opinion, of any meetings, conversations, or any actual collusion,” Goldman explains. According to Goldman, the complaint is primarily focused on the fact that the chicken industry pools certain anonymous data on plant efficiency. The complaint alleges that the industry may have cut back production based on this data and artificially restrained supply. In fact, JPMorgan believes this data isn't relied upon to make any important business decisions. Goldman adds that Sanderson’s inclusion in the complaint is puzzling given the fact that the company has increased production by 55 percent since 2008. Ironically, the major reason JPMorgan is not bullish on Tyson is because the firm is expecting chicken fundamentals to worsen in the next year due to increases in production.

Concerns over Deutsche Bank AG’s mounting legal costs deepened the gloom. Mary Callahan Erdoes Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg Slow growth is leaving companies little reason to expand, fueling the public’s frustration and giving rise to extreme political views and nationalism, said Erdoes, 49, who runs JPMorgan’s asset-management operations. Low interest rates -- instead of better fiscal stimulus -- are taking a toll on the entire system, she said. “We had a very smart economist at JPMorgan ask me the following question: How do you have capitalism without any cost of capital? And therein lies the problem.” The 1,600 finance executives attended panel discussions at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center, a short walk from the Washington Monument. Among their biggest targets for criticism were international stimulus efforts. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President Gary Cohn called the world’s central banks an “ineffective cartel,” as actions in Europe and Japan lead to negative rates and hamstring other policy makers. The outlook for low growth is long-term, he said. For a QuickTake explainer on the world of low interest rates, click here “I don’t see this changing,” Cohn said Friday. “We keep saying we’re getting closer to the end, but I don’t think we’re getting closer to the end.” Getting Messier Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser to Allianz SE, agreed that central banks have lost an edge in an era of “ultra-low and negative interest rates.” He said companies have become more risk-averse. “As we look to the next five years, I think that the world of low growth destroys itself,” El-Erian, who is also a columnist for Bloomberg View, said at a panel discussion on Saturday. “Politically it’s getting messier and messier,” influencing rate policy and leading to moves like Brexit. Bank leaders including Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said tougher rules sparked by the 2008 financial crisis, while necessary, may now be another drag on the economy, and firms must figure out a way to prosper. “If you want higher growth, you have got to let banks do what they do,” Gorman said. “This is an industry which is essential to global economic growth. The challenge is, we’re all in this together. So the banks have to collectively raise themselves to a standard of, not perfection, but global professionalism.” Brexit Horror The U.K.’s expected exit from the European Union after a referendum this year looks to be painful and “horrific,” Standard Chartered Plc CEO Bill Winters said at the conference. Others echoed his thoughts. “I’m afraid I don’t see anything good here,” said David Wright, chair of EuroFi, during a Thursday discussion. “I see a host of second- and third-class decisions to be made. It’s bad for the U.K., for sure. It’s bad for Europe, for sure.” Shares of the entire financial industry have swung in recent weeks on news that the U.S. Justice Department asked Deutsche Bank to pay $14 billion to settle an investigation into mortgage-backed securities. The bank has said it expects U.S. authorities to scale back their initial request, and that it has ample cash. Deutsche Bank Deutsche Bank is a counterparty to the largest European and U.S. banks. While the Frankfurt-based firm’s struggles weren’t the focus of the conference on stage, executives acknowledged there are financial and reputational risks whenever a member of the interconnected financial system flails. Bankers huddled around coffee urns or over cocktails in the evening, discussing possible outcomes of the Deutsche Bank situation, whether the German government would be involved financially, what the repercussions for the European economy and their own firms could be. The latest rumors were shared, as well as advice for executives of the embattled firm. The German lender hosted an opening-night reception for conference attendees at Smithsonian’s Renwick Gallery, a stone’s throw from the White House and several blocks from the Department of Justice. CEO John Cryan attended. Over the weekend, German newspaper Bild said he also went to Washington to help negotiate a settlement. The talks are continuing, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Adjusting Businesses “I have little doubt that Deutsche Bank will find its way through these problems,” Winters said in an interview during the conference. “John Cryan is doing exactly the right things to work through a difficult situation. I’m not saying it’s going to be easy, but they seem to be developing a relationship with their own government that’s intended to resolve their open issues.”  The bankers, who gathered from regions including Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe, heard from a panel that global recovery remains slow and uneven, with growth expected to pick up only slightly next year -- mostly on account of emerging markets. Persistently low growth has exposed “underlying structural weaknesses, and risks further dampening potential growth and prospects for inclusiveness,” the panel found. Bank executives said they were trying to adapt to the new environment. “We’re clearly aware of the need to adjust our business models,’’ Societe Generale SA CEO Frederic Oudea said. “We’re managing a transition that’s tough.” Dimon’s Slogan JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said at a Friday discussion that “monetary authorities are trying to figure out” what to do, but that the system lacks coordination. Policy makers failed to pass immigration reform, aren’t spending enough on infrastructure and are enacting onerous regulations, he said. “Fiscal policy and monetary policy -- if we got those things right I think we would have extra growth,” Dimon said. Instead, “wherever I travel in the world, I’m just overwhelmed by comments from clients on what they can’t do because of rules.” Asked if he would want to enter politics one day, Dimon replied that he would “love” to be president but wouldn’t run. He flashed a smile -- a cheerful moment amid the downbeat proceedings. “My slogan: Make America Fun Again.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Consumer confidence rises again, extending its 'remarkable run of stability' Demand for Australia's first-ever 30-year bond pushes past the $13b mark London's FTSE hits a new all-time high as the pound continues to crumble Wall Street adds a new risk to its list of things to fret about: a Clinton landslide Poor start to US earnings season as industrial bellwether Alcoa's numbers disappoint Sort posts by Newest Oldest 1:35pm on 12 Oct 2016 That's it for Markets Live today. Thanks for reading and your comments. See you all again tomorrow morning from 9. 1:33pm on 12 Oct 2016 Here's a late column by The Age's economics editor Peter Martin, in which he wonders whether the entire country will follow booming coal prices: What if, suddenly, we were out of the woods? Quietly, the mining industry has just doubled the price of coking coal. Instead of getting $US81 ($107) per tonne as it did back in March, for the next three months it'll get $US200 per tonne from Japan, the most in four years. And Japan has reason to be grateful. The so-called spot price has surged even higher, to $US213 per tonne. If it stays there, or even near there, a good chunk of Scott Morrison's budget problems will have vanished, just as they vanished for Peter Costello during the mining boom at the start of the century. The Committee for the Economic Development of Australia believes Morrison needs to boost the budget by $17 billion per year if he is to get the deficit down to zero by the end of the decade. After a quarter-century of economic growth, that's probably where it should be, if not in surplus. To date he's shown himself to be incapable of much at all. The much-vaunted "omnibus savings bill" he has just got through the Senate saves $6 billion over four years. The net effect on the budget won't be much. It'll be improved if his superannuation tax hikes get through the Senate, and harmed if his company tax cuts get through. The explosion in the price of coking coal could deliver much more. Access Economics says for every $US1 the price rockets, the budget deficit will improve $65 million. Multiply that by the number of dollars the price has rocketed and you get a boost of $7 billion per year if the new price holds. And that's just for coking coal. The iron ore price is up 40 per cent this year. The price of thermal coal (the stuff that makes electricity) is up 55 per cent. It's not bad for an industry that had been shutting mines and laying off workers. Read more. Quietly, the mining industry has just doubled the price of coking coal. Photo: Glenn Hunt 1:26pm on 12 Oct 2016 Australian stocks recovered from an early resources-led slump to close only marginally lower, as investors picked up Telstra shares and were cheered by another buyback announcement from CSL. A disappointing start to US earnings season, a drop in the oil price as well as another jump in the greenback had combined to drag down Wall Street's S&P 500 index by 1.2 per cent, triggering a leap in Wall Street's "fear gauge", the CBOE Market Volatility index, which ended the day up 15 per cent. The weak leads cast a gloom over the local market at the start of trade, pulling the S&P/ASX 200 index down as much as 0.8 per cent in early trade. But bargain hunting in Telstra, which ended 1 per cent higher, and a positive market reaction to CSL's latest share buyback sparked a turnaround and the benchmark index ended the day just 0.1 per cent lower at 5474.6. CSL, which suffered a 25 per cent shareholder vote, or "first strike" against its remuneration report at the company's AGM on Wednesday, announced a $500 million buyback and said its nearly completed previous buyback over $1 billion had boosted earnings per share by 25 per cent by June. Shares ended 1 per cent higher.  The biggest drag on the index came from the materials sector, which dropped 1.1 per cent on falling commodity prices and as UBS turned more cautious on the sector, which is up 42 per cent this year, against the ASX200's much more modest 6 per cent gain. The broker downgraded BHP Billiton and South32 to neutral, while Whitehaven Coal - which has quadrupled in price this year - was cut to sell. "We believe all three are quality companies, but see risks as manganese and coal prices are at unsustainable levels, with the factors that drove prices up reversing," UBS analysts led by Glyn Lawcock said. The shares were among the day's biggest losers, with BHP falling 1.5 per cent, South32 down 1.6 per cent and Whitehaven losing 2.1 per cent. UBS switched its diversified miner preference from BHP to Rio Tinto, which lost 0.9 per cent on Wednesday, saying that the rise in iron ore prices, if sustained through the end of the year, could spell additional returns for Rio in 2017. Shares of wagering companies Tabcorp and Tatts both jumped, 2.8 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively, after New South Wales reversed a ban on greyhound racing that was due to start next July. Winners and losers today. Photo: Bloomberg 1:00pm on 12 Oct 2016 Samsung Electronics is corporate royalty in South Korea. It's also a company recognised for its marketing smarts and engineering savvy worldwide, so much so that consulting firm Interbrand ranked it as the world's seventh most valuable in its 2016 survey, ahead of Amazon and Mercedes-Benz. So how is it that the pride of South Korea has so botched the recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones after complaints of exploding batteries — and a ton of negative publicity by the media in the US, Europe and China, not to mention the vast echo chamber of social media? When it recalled phones last month, it assured consumers it had diagnosed the problem and that its replacements were safe. Not so it turns out: Customers reported the lithium batteries in new phones went up in flames too, in some instances. On Tuesday, Samsung took the dramatic step of killing off the Note 7 for good. "This is a calamity," said Srinivas Reddy, director at the Center for Marketing Excellence at Singapore Management University. "The threat for Samsung is how soon they can get back. If they don't get back soon, it provides a vacuum for others to creep in." The company has not said how many new or replacement phones will be affected. Analysts estimated that the original recall would cost between $US1 billion and $US2 billion, but that figure will now certainly rise. Chung Chang Won, an analyst at Nomura, estimated in a research note before the company's announcement the worst-case scenario of Samsung terminating the Note 7 would cost the company about $US5 billion in operating profit through 2017. The move sent Samsung shares down 8 per cent on Tuesday, vaporising $US17 billion in market value. The stock dropped as much as 3.3 percent today before steadying but is still more than 10 per cent down this week. Samsung's sterling brand image built up over decades is at risk unless the management team led by vice chairman Jay Y. Lee, 48, doesn't get out in front of the crisis soon. 12:47pm on 12 Oct 2016 The pound is bouncing back, halting a four-day slide against the US dollar, after UK Prime Minister Theresa May accepted that parliament should be allowed to vote on her Brexit plan. Sterling climbed as much as 1.4 per cent against the greenback, the most on an intraday basis since September 1, and was up against all its 31 major peers. A gauge of the US dollar retreated from a two-month high that was reached Tuesday. "Given how aggressively short the pound the market was positioned, the prospect of UK parliament at least discussing the downside of a 'hard Brexit' has encouraged substantial profit-taking on those positions," said Westpac senior strategist Sean Callow. The pound is up 1.1 per cent to $US1.2258, rallying from a 4.9 per cent slide over the previous four days. On Friday, sterling plunged to the lowest level since 1985 versus the greenback in a move that traders blamed on possible human error and algorithms. Theresa May's latest move to allow parliament a say in Brexit negotiations has calmed investors. Photo: Bloomberg Back to top 12:20pm on 12 Oct 2016 What he said... *AUSTRALIA SELLS A$7.6BLN OF 30-YEAR BONDS IN BIGGEST EVER DEAL— Martin Whetton (@martin_whetton) October 12, 2016 12:17pm on 12 Oct 2016 UBS analysts have taken stock for metal and mining stocks at three-quarter time in what has been a blockbuster 2016, and have decided that it's time to get a little more cautious on the sector. The sector is up 42 per cent this year, against the ASX 200's 6 per cent gain. As we reported early in the day, the broker downgraded BHP and South32 to neutral, while Whitehaven Coal - which has quadrupled in price this year - gets cut to sell. "We believe all three are quality companies, but see risks as manganese and coal prices are at unsustainable levels, with the factors that drove prices up reversing," the analysts write. Those "factors" that have been boosting prices have to do with long-awaited lower production levels rather than increased hunger for resources, the analysts say. "It is very apparent that demand has not been the cause of the rise, but curtailed supply," they write. "Either through voluntary reductions (manganese, alumina, aluminium, oil) or government enforced (coal)." "The question now is will these prices hold or will supply increase. The Chinese government seem determined to cap coal prices, easing supply restrictions. On the flip side, we don't believe the industry or governments want to revisit the January lows." Higher commodity prices, cost cutting, and lower capex has all helped the powerful 2016 sector performance, the UBS team note. But now, with the sector up strongly, the potential upside to the analysts' price target have come down. You can see that pretty clearly in the BHP chart below. "We switch our diversified preference to Rio, with a view that a sustained iron ore price through year-end could see additional returns in 2017," they write. The other stock which keeps its buy rating is Iluka Resources. "After four years of declining prices, for both zircon and titanium dioxide feedstock, we believe prices are now in the process of rising or about to rise (depending on the commodity and end market) over the next couple of years," the analysts wrote a few weeks back. 12:02pm on 12 Oct 2016 At the current rate the ASX could even end in the black, reversing a gloomy start. The benchmark index is down 0.3 per cent, well off the day's early lows, with gains in CSL, Telstra and three of the four big banks (ex NAB) contributing to the afternoon recovery. Miners and energy stocks remain the biggest losers of the session, but most have also retreated from early lows. 11:38am on 12 Oct 2016 ANZ and NAB are the best bets for investors in the banking sector over the next 12 months in an overall sharemarket which may only creep ahead by about 5 per cent by late 2017, says the head of Australian equities for global investment giant T.Rowe Price. The two Melbourne-based banks which have more of a traditional skew to business banking are likely to perform better than CBA and Westpac, which have greater exposure to residential lending as Australian house prices hit a peak. Randal Jenneke, head of Australian equities with T.Rowe Price, the US firm which has more than $776 billion in funds under management around the world, says there isn't likely to be any substantial housing price slide in Australia which will feed into tougher times for the big banks. "The business banks are better positioned," Jenneke said. "They are exposed to the better part of the sector". CBA shares have come off about 13 per cent since the start of 2016 to around $74 and the traditional premium it has been awarded by investors would keep retreating, with the PE multiples for all four likely to keep converging. Jenneke said overall, the big bank share prices were at reasonable levels now, but it was likely that others would follow the lead of ANZ in paring back dividend payout ratios. Here's more at the AFR ($) ANZ and NAb are less exposed to residential housing than CBA and Westpac. Photo: Joe Armao 11:21am on 12 Oct 2016 Shock resistant Australia will be the fastest growing triple A-rated commodity exporting economy in 2016, Moody's predicts. The forecast is a reflection of the local economy's resilience to sharp commodity price declines, as export volumes have increased strongly despite falls in metals prices, and the services sector has benefited from a weaker domestic currency, the ratings agency says. "The weaker Australian dollar and lower interest rates have allowed it to take an increasing market share of rising global demand for tourism and education services," Moody's says. Moody's expects Australia's GDP growth to continue to outperform Canada and Norway, and come in at a similar rate to New Zealand (all triple-A in the Moody's world). But it's not all good news, as Moody's expects Australia's fiscal deficit to remain wider for longer than the government projects, "constraints to fiscal consolidation are likely to persist". "Although Australia's general government debt will rise as a result, to around 41 per cent of GDP in 2017 - higher than in New Zealand and Norway - it will remain much lower than in Canada, and other Aaa-rated sovereigns." Moody's notes that all four countries have experienced rapid increases in house prices and household debt, exposing their economies and financial systems to negative shocks. "Nonetheless, the intrinsic financial strength of Australia's banks - somewhat higher than in Canada, New Zealand and Norway - lowers the potential cost of government support to the banking system in the event of stress." Back to top 10:52am on 12 Oct 2016 Sky-high prices and worrying levels of household debt leave the housing market vulnerable, but it would take a recession or much higher interest rates to spark a crash, says AMP Capital Investors head of investment strategy Shane Oliver says.  Oliver lists four reasons why a house price crash is currently unlikely: No oversupply: We have not seen a generalised housing oversupply and at the current rate we won't go into oversupply until around 2017-18. No stress: Despite talk of mortgage stress the reality is that debt interest payments relative to income are around 2004 levels. No low-doc boom: Australia has still not seen anything like the deterioration in lending standards seen in other countries prior to the GFC. In fact in recent years there has been a decline in low-doc loans and a reduction in loans with high loan to valuation ratios. No national bubble: While property prices have surged 60% and 40% over the last four years in Sydney and Melbourne, they have fallen in Perth to 2007 levels and have seen only moderate growth in the other capital cities. Possible triggers for a property crash, ie falls of 20 per cent or more, include a recession, a surge in interest rates or property oversupply, but Oliver doesn't see any of these factors in the near future. Oliver concedes that the surging supply of apartments and the continuing strength of the Sydney and Melbourne property markets pose an increasing risk, adding he expects some price correction over the mid term. "Average dwelling prices in these cities are likely to see another cyclical 5-10 per cent price downswing around 2018, with unit prices in oversupplied areas likely to decline 15-20 per cent." The combination of high house prices, low rental yields and a coming surge in the supply of apartments mean property investors need to be careful, Oliver warns: "Best for investors to focus on undersupplied, less loved parts of the property market." 10:28am on 12 Oct 2016 Less than a week after raising $US3 billion in a private debt sale, Deutsche Bank has returned for another $US1.5 billion, offering yields that were more than twice what it paid to borrow a year ago. The German lender issued the debt to mostly the same investors who bought last week's offering, Bloomberg reports quoting a person with knowledge of the matter. But it paid a slightly smaller premium this time around, with the deal priced at 290 basis points above borrowing benchmarks, the person, who asked not to be identified because the information isn't public, told Bloomberg. The premium on the October 7 sale was 300 basis points. The debt offering was the first for Deutsche Bank after the US Justice Department demanded $US14 billion to settle claims that it misled investors over mortgage-backed securities before the American housing crisis. The claim has fuelled concerns about the viability of the bank. While the bank is showing it can quickly raise funding, it's proving to be expensive. The $US4.5 billion notes pay a coupon of 4.25 per cent and are due in 2021. Overnight, worries about the rise in Deutsche's short-term borrowing costs weighed a bit on the bank's share price, which dropped 1.6 per cent to 12.31 euros. And investor nerves weren't soothed by a report in the Financial Times this week that Deutsche was given special treatment in the EU's banking stress tests, the results of which were announced in July. A red road traffic light stands illuminated next to the logo of the Deutsche Bank's offices in Berlin. Global markets are increasingly focused the travails of Europe's biggest bank.  Photo: Krisztian Bocsi 10:12am on 12 Oct 2016 Time for a lunchtime update and the ASX has picked itself up off the mat and managed to claw back around half of the morning's losses as banks rallied from early falls, but the benchmark remains 22 points, or 0.4 per cent, lower at 5458. Miners are still well lower after a tough night for commodities. BHP is off 2.2 per cent, with UBS downgrading the stock to "neutral". Rio is off 1.6 per cent and Fortescue and South32 by 3.4 per cent. Energy stocks are also retracing some of yesterday's enthusiasm, with Origin off 2.9 per cent, Oil Search 2.5 per cent and Woodside 1.3 per cent. The negativity surrounding resources stems at least in part to the US dollar moving sharply higher overnight as investors ramped up their worries around a December rate rise by the Fed. Some of that US currency move has unwound through today's session, with the Aussie recovering some ground against the greenback to last fetch 75.7 US cents. The pound has moved smartly higher today after being battered over recent days. The mood is also negative across the region, with Japanese and Chinese stocks lower. Helping prop up the market, as mentioned, are some limited gains in the big lenders. Westpac is up 0.3 per cent, CBA 0.2 per cent and ANZ 0.1 per cent, while NAB is off 0.4 per cent. Among stocks in the news, CSL is up 0.5 per cent following its AGM in which the company received a "first strike" against its remuneration policy, but confirmed a $500 million buyback and earnings guidance. Vocus was off as much as 6.8 per cent this morning on news the founder had resigned amid a leadership dispute, but is now off 3.5 per cent. Tatts and Tabcorp have jumped - by 2.1 per cent and 2.6 per cent, respectively - following the NSW government's about-face on greyhound racing. Aussie 10-year yields continue to move higher to 2.266 per cent. Since September 30 traders have lowered their odds of more easing from the RBA, from a 60 per cent chance of a cut over the next 12 months or so to only 40 per cent. Winners and losers in the ASX 200. Photo: Bloomberg 9:22am on 12 Oct 2016 It's been a long property boom. Prices in Australia's two biggest housing markets have grown rapidly for four years. In that time the median price for a standalone house has jumped by 60 per cent in Sydney and 40 per cent in Melbourne, Domain Group figures show. But much less attention is given to how rising property values change our behaviour. The housing booms that are so much part of the modern Australian story alter the way we live. Some house-price driven changes are obvious – like the tendency for young adults to live in the family home for longer than in the past. The momentous shift to higher density living in our big cities is another palpable example. But the rising cost of housing reshapes behaviour in more subtle ways. New research for the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute by Sydney University economists draws attention to some of these significant but less heralded changes. They examined more than a decade of data on the assets, borrowings and work patterns of thousands of households to investigate links between house prices, household debt and the jobs market. One striking discovery was that house price movements have a "clear and consistent" influence on how much some people work. The biggest effect was on older women who own a home. The economists found that for every 10 per cent rise in house price there was an "economically significant" drop in labour force participation by single and partnered women aged 55 and over who own property (although not men). Why? The economists say there is a tendency for females in that age group to use any unexpected wealth gains from house prices to retire early. Rising property values also affect the work choices made by younger women and men. Those between 20 and 40 years who own property cut back their hours of work, on average, following strong gains in housing wealth. At that formative stage of the family life-cycle many young couples use housing wealth gains to help manage the juggle between work and family. Read more. Illustration: John Shakespeare  9:00am on 12 Oct 2016 Biotechnology company CSL will buy back up to $500 million worth of shares to improve returns and earnings per share. The announcement comes as chairman John Shine said the company's $1 billion buyback, announced last October, is 91 per cent complete. Shine also said the board would endeavour to communicate better about the way in which it is evolving its executive pay model to one suited for a global company after receiving a 25 per cent shareholder vote  or "first strike" against its remuneration report. Chief executive Paul Perreault confirmed the company's full year guidance for 2016-17 for an 11 per cent rebound in net profit after tax at constant currencies, and 14 per cent growth in trading profits, also at constant currencies.   Perreault said the company expected earnings per share growth to exceed trading profits growth this year. Net profits dipped 10 per cent last year as CSL digested its Novartis acquisition and the northern hemisphere enjoyed a mild flu season. The latest share buyback was flagged as being under consideration when CSL announced its annual results in August. Buybacks last year and in previous years have helped boost earnings per share by 26 per cent, Shine told shareholders at the Melbourne Tennis Centre. Shares are down 0.3 per cent at $105.21. CSL says buybacks have boosted earnings per share by 25 per cent. Photo: Supplied Back to top 8:38am on 12 Oct 2016 Thousands of aggrieved Slater and Gordon shareholders will be represented in a $250 million-plus class action against the law firm for wrongdoing including allegedly "blindsiding" them with bad news. Rival law firm Maurice Blackburn will file an open class action on behalf of more than 3000 shareholders, including some of the largest institutional investors, in the Federal Court. Slater & Gordon shares have tanked as much as 7.1 per cent to 39 cents on the news, snapping four days of gains. Maurice Blackburn says Slater and Gordon did not disclose information about its finances in a timely manner to shareholders on multiple occasions, leading to investors losing millions of dollars when the firm's share price tanked in 2015. "They didn't just miss their earnings guidance predictions - they were miles off - and that suggests systemic issues across the company," Maurice Blackburn's national head of class actions Andrew Watson said in a written statement. "To blindside shareholders once is really bad news; if it happens twice, it's then a farce, but to happen again and again and again - you can understand why shareholders want serious questions answered about the internal corporate governance of the company." Watson said the company shocked the share market with multiple bad news that led to more than $2 billion being wiped from the stock's value in less than a year. Slater and Gordon is facing a $250 million class action from Maurice Blackburn.  8:15am on 12 Oct 2016 Consumer confidence is still experiencing a remarkable run of stability despite the local and international political events over the past six months. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute index of consumer sentiment for October has risen to 102.4 points, up 1.1 per cent from 101.4 points in September. The index has been stable above the 100 mark for the past three months and has risen by 4.7 per cent from its level a year ago. "This has been despite some significant local events including two rate cuts from the Reserve Bank; a very close election result and the aftermath of the May (federal) budget," Westpac chief economist Bill Evans said. Evans said international events like Britain's vote to leave the European Union and the volatile US presidential election campaign had not shaken confidence, while concerns about China had been toned down and the prices of Australian commodity exports were rising. "This stability is signalling a sustained lift in consumer sentiment over the last year," he said. "The average level of the index over this last, stable six months is now 4.9 per cent higher than the average of the same six months a year ago. However, the boost is all in expectations." The further rise in the Westpac measure of consumer confidence in October supports other evidence that consumption growth will remain healthy enough over the next few months, said Capital Economics Australia economist Paul Dales. "That said, the survey does indicate that sentiment towards the housing market is waning." Some doubts are creeping in. Photo: Westpac 8:02am on 12 Oct 2016 Bond selloff, poor earnings, commodities falling, as if that wasn't enough, Wall Street has a new political risk to fret about: a Democrat landslide. While a president Hillary Clinton is considered a positive for markets, at least when compared to the prospect of a Trump presidency, a Clinton landslide election win that delivers (potentially) anti-business Democrats control of the US Congress seems a less appealing proposition for investors. Before Trump's implosion over the past few days, polls were pointing to the combination of a Clinton White House and small-government Republicans retaining their big majority in the House of Representatives. The current Republican-controlled Senate is a toss up. However, Trump's toxicity and turmoil in the Republican party after House speaker Paul Ryan distanced himself from the presidential candidate is leading to some speculation a victory by Clinton could be accompanied by big gains of her party in the House. "There is more discussion that the control in Congress could possibly shift," said Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer of Bryn Mawr Trust in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. "The bottom line is that it's not really priced into the market." Wall Street's big fear is that Democrats would come in with new regulations and less favourable tax plans that the Republican-controlled Congress would have thwarted. The Democratic policy platform, heavily influenced by Bernie Sanders and his followers, calls for raising taxes on business and the wealthy, a higher minimum wage, more employee family leave and larger spending on social programs. "Today's the first day where people said, 'Wow, what happens if the Republicans lose Congress?'" said Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group. "I think it's still a far-fetched possibility. There's no question if Hillary wins that Paul Ryan will get all the support he needs from Republicans." Traders mull the possibility of a Clinton landslide and its policy ramifications. Photo: Richard Drew 7:38am on 12 Oct 2016 The bond market sell-off has not soured interest in Australia's first-ever 30-year bond for which demand has pushed past the $13 billion mark, although the size of the actual offer is likely to be much less than that. The new bond, which matures March 21, 2047, was launched yesterday and is expected to be finalised today. It has been met with great interest from domestic and international investors. The sale, managed by the Australian Office of Financial Management, follows successful long-term debt raisings by other sovereign borrowers such as Ireland, Spain, Belgium and Italy that are luring yield hungry conservative investors frustrated by near zero rates in most major bond markets.   Traders believe demand is likely to have come from insurance companies eyeing globally attractive long-term rates paid by a triple-A rated borrower, and short-term traders and funds looking to buy securities that will gain in value if a slowdown in China forces further Reserve Bank of Australia rate cuts.  The spread has been set at 3.24 per cent, or 101 basis points above the 10-year yield, which is within the range investors had speculated earlier. ANZ, Citi, Commonwealth Bank, Deutsche Bank, UBS and Westpac are managing the issue. In it for the long haul.  7:25am on 12 Oct 2016 Shares have slumped at the open, pulled down by miners and energy stocks after commodity prices and Wall Street sunk overnight. The ASX has lost 0.7 per cent to 5444.1 and the All Ords is down 0.65 per cent at 5527.0. All sectors are in the red, but materials and energy are leading the falls, down 1.6 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively. BHP, Rio and South32 have all shed around 2.2 per cent. After resisting the sell-off in bonds and rising yields for nearly two weeks, US equity markets finally bowed to pressure last night, dropping below the recent trading range, CMC chief market analyst Ric Spooner said. "Stock markets are becoming nervous about the prospect of rising interest rates against a background of moderate profit growth and relatively high valuations, particularly in the US." Investors are also likely to be cautious ahead of the Fed minutes due for release tonight, he said. "Given how critical the interest rate outlook is for markets at the moment, markets will be focused on the degree of support for a rate hike this year revealed in the Fed minutes."

The major averages climbed off their worst levels of the day going into the close but remained firmly negative. The Dow tumbled 200.38 points or 1.1 percent to 18,128.66, the Nasdaq plunged 81.89 points or 1.5 percent to 5,246.79 and the S&P 500 slumped 26.93 points or 1.2 percent to 2,136.73. The sell-off on Wall Street partly reflected a negative reaction to earnings news from Alcoa (AA), with the aluminum giant slumping by 11.4 percent. The steep drop by shares of Alcoa came after the company reported third quarter earnings and revenues that came in below analyst estimates. The release of quarterly results from Alcoa is seen as the unofficial start of earnings season, with financial giants Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) due to report their results later this week. A pullback by the price of crude oil along with an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar also weighed on the markets. Crude oil for November delivery slid $0.56 to $50.79 a barrel after ending Monday's session up $1.54 at $51.35 a barrel, the highest closing level since July of 2015. Light trading activity may have exaggerated the downward move by the markets amid another quiet day in terms of major U.S. economic news. Sector News Biotechnology stocks moved sharply lower over the course of the trading session, resulting in a 3.7 percent drop by the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index. The index fell to its lowest closing level in well over two months. Illumina (ILMN) led the biotech sector lower, plunging by 24.8 percent after cutting its third quarter revenue guidance. Considerable weakness was also visible among electronic storage stocks, as reflected by the 3.6 percent loss posted by the NYSE Arca Disk Drive Index. Seagate Technology (STX) fell sharply despite providing upbeat guidance. Semiconductor stocks also came under pressure on the day, dragging the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index down by 2.1 percent. The index pulled back further off the sixteen-year closing high it set last Thursday Health care, gold, networking, and steel stocks also saw significant weakness, moving lower along with most of the other major sectors. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index jumped by 1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled by 1.3 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets all moved to the downside on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index slid by 0.6 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the German DAX Index both fell by 0.4 percent. In the bond market, treasuries moved moderately lower, resuming their recent downward trend. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, rose by 2.3 basis points to a four-month closing high of 1.759 percent. Looking Ahead Trading on Wednesday may be impacted by reaction to the minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, which may shed some additional light on the outlook for monetary policy. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America These Companies Are Sitting On Mountains Of Cash More Commentary -Global European Shares Seen Up Despite Weak Asian Cues Indian Markets Closed For Public Holiday Asian Markets Mostly Lower Thai Bourse Draws Flat Lead For Monday Indonesia Shares May Find Traction On Monday Hong Kong Shares May Find Support On Monday China Bourse May Flirt With 3,200-Point Level Little Movement Expected For Taiwan Bourse Singapore Market May See Support At 2,800 Points Malaysia Stock Market To Remain Rangebound South Korea Shares May Be Stuck In Neutral Stocks Close Mixed On The Day But Sharply Higher For The Week - U.S. Commentary Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness Following Post-Election Rally - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Mostly Lower As Trump Rally Fizzles Stocks Turning In Lackluster Performance In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary <<Previous        118 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America Continental Stock Dips On Weak Q3 Profit; Sees Strong Earnings In Q4 AstraZeneca Q3 Pre-tax Profit Down On Crestor Generic; Backs FY View Alphabet Cancels Drone Deal With Starbucks As Project Leaders Pushed Out Viacom Q4 Adj.

General Electric: What To Do If The Stock Drops Next Time (Seeking Alpha) Barclays expects JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) to report above-consensus earnings per share, extending the six-quarter streak of earnings outperformance. Analysts Jason Goldberg expects the company to report Q3 earnings of $1.48 per share, above the $1.38 per share consensus estimate. The analyst expects one-time gains/charges to continue to influence results. The analyst expects modest balance sheet expansion relative to the second quarter, a relatively stable net interest margin, lower fee income, seasonally soft trading revenues, higher mortgage and asset management fees, relatively stable expenses, sound asset quality trends, a lower tax rate and continued share repurchase. Performance By Businesses Corporate & Investment Bank – lower revenues on seasonally slower trading results and investment banking fees Consumer & Business Banking – Deposit Growth But Pressured Deposit Margin Mortgage – Better net results Card – Loan balance growth but revenue pressured by partnership renewal, although Sapphire sign-up and benign asset quality should help Commercial Banking – Loan growth, Asset quality positive but continued pressure in energy Asset Quality – better markets and activity to help Corporate/Private Equity – Mixed performance. However, Barclays remain watchful on higher than expected Sapphire reserve, seasonally lower trading results, capital, expenses, the impact of the EU referendum and the weakness in energy. Barclays has an Overweight rating and $79 price target on shares.

Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now What would a Trump presidency mean for investors? It's not as obvious as you might think, according to Quartz. The web site talked to analysts about how investors should alter their portfolios if Republican nominee Donald J. Trump wins the White House in November. Given what is known about Trump's plans, the obvious trades involve Mexico. The analysts said to go short on the peso and look to buy stock in companies that might be contracted to build that border wall between the United States and Mexico.  So far, Magal Security Systems, based in Israel, would be a leading contender, the site said referencing a Bloomberg article.  Less obvious, and possibly more interesting to Texans, is that oil company stocks wouldn't necessarily be as attractive under a Trump administration. While his energy plans do call for more fracking and less regulation, the site quotes analyst Andy Goldberg at JPMorgan Asset Management saying there could be a downside to putting more oil in the market, namely, an oversupply that would bring down prices. Goldberg says:  "More energy production in and of itself in an environment where we are still working through an energy glut might actually hurt energy prices, which might hurt profits and hurt the market. Even though this is clearly a pro-business policy stance, the impact of unintended consequences people should be more mindful of." Indeed, just last month oil stocks soared on the news that OPEC might have reached an agreement to cut production by three-quarters of a million barrels per day.  Another less obvious trade is on gun stocks. As one analyst notes, people tend to buy more guns when they fear gun control legislation could be coming. Trump has said repeatedly that he would not favor restrictions on gun ownership. What that would mean for Smith & Wesson stock probably would be a fall from the heights it has reached this year. For  the full article on "How to trade a Trump presidency," go here.  The article does have a disclaimer, we should note. At the end in small print, the site states, "It should go without saying, but this material is not intended to provide and should not be relied on for accounting legal or tax advice, or investment recommendations." So take that for what it's worth.

across 11th Avenue in front of the corporate headquarters of IAC in New York City. Investors should buy IAC/InterActive shares on the strong growth prospects of its diversified internet holdings, according to JPMorgan, which initiated coverage on the company with an overweight rating. "We believe IAC is positioned well to take share in the large and growing global online dating and US home services markets," analyst Doug Anmuth wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. The bull thesis is driven in part by "upside from Match (MTCH) driven by Tinder strength, more stability in classic brands, and a large ad opportunity." Anmuth's picks have an 18.8 percent one-year average return with a 67 percent success rate, according to analyst ranking service TipRanks, placing him in the top 1 percent of all Wall Street analysts covering any industry.

REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach By Pamela Barbaglia and Sophie Sassard | LONDON LONDON (In this October 11 story Deutsche Bank says it has changed the reporting lines of Evans Haji-Touma and Ashok Pandit referred to in last paragraph but has corrected an earlier statement that said they have been promoted to global co-heads of sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and family offices) Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) promoted a group of its senior investment bankers on Tuesday, part of an internal reshuffle as it tries to boost its flagging performance in corporate mergers and acquisitions and capital markets. The German bank, threatened with a multi-billion-dollar fine from U.S. regulators, saw its global investment banking fees fall nearly 30 percent to $2 billion in the first nine months of the year, slipping behind its nearest European rival Barclays (BARC.L) to seventh position in the investment banking league tables, according to Thomson Reuters data. But Alasdair Warren, the bank's head of corporate and investment banking for Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) told Reuters he's confident the German lender can recover some lost ground over the next 12 months, particularly in equity capital markets (ECM), and he is making a series of changes to the investment bank's structure. "We're confident that we can rise back up in the ECM league tables," said Warren, a former co-head of the global private equity advisory business at Goldman Sachs, who joined Deutsche in May this year. Deutsche Bank has seen fees from global equity products take the biggest hit in the first nine months of the year with a 45 percent decline to $328 million. In the same period its global M&A fees went down 31 percent while fees attached to global loans and bonds slipped 36 percent and 14 percent, respectively. The bank's share price has almost halved this year, prompting speculation that it could lose some of its top investment bankers. Last week its global co-head of real estate, gaming and lodging Massimo Saletti left to join JPMorgan while on Tuesday sources with direct knowledge of the matter said its Asia Pacific wealth management head Ravi Raju is moving to UBS. But Warren has promised to reward those in his division who stay at the bank with "career opportunities" despite having a limited budget for expensive rainmakers. He is trying to shift the investment banking business to focus more on providing clients with long-term advisory services in dealmaking. "Previously, there was a greater focus on markets and financing-related products, whereas we're now focusing on building long-term strategic dialogue and relationships, and refocusing our client coverage," he said. He announced a series of changes to staff on Tuesday including promoting Bob Douglas to head its EMEA consumer and retail corporate finance team, where he has been working for the last decade. Douglas will continue to report to Scott Bell, global co-head of consumer, who has been given an additional role as the head of UK and Ireland corporate finance. In Britain Charles Wilkinson, co-head of UK corporate broking, becomes chairman of the division, while Matt Hall succeeds Wilkinson as co-head of UK corporate broking alongside Andrew Tusa. These appointments are aimed at revamping Deutsche's UK business with some bankers, including Bell and Tusa, also joining a new leadership group for UK corporate and investment banking. "PEOPLE AGENDA" Meanwhile Warren has tried to address gaps in Deutsche's dealmaking capacity across Europe. For example the bank had no one based in its home country to look after the industrials sector, the biggest source of deals in Germany. "We have great product capability and geographical coverage but we need to add resources to some of our sector coverage teams," he said. "Most of what we are doing will be driven by our existing people, but we will make a few external hires to add to our coverage in certain sectors," he added. So far this year the bank has failed to rank among the top three advisors for the biggest announced deals in each industry, according to Thomson Reuters data, and was unable to advise Bayer (BAYGn.DE) on its $66 billion takeover of Monsanto (MON.N), the biggest deal ever clinched by a German buyer, having pledged loyalty to a rival suitor. Warren said he has a "people agenda" and while pay remains important he will also use "career opportunities" to motivate staff. "In order to attract and retain talent, you can't simply focus on compensation," he said. "We have a 'people agenda' and it's all about offering people the opportunity to grow and develop as professionals. We evaluate their performance twice a year and monitor their progress." EFFICIENCIES Among other changes aimed at streamlining the business, Warren has decided to merge the bank's maritime industries business into the global industrials group within corporate finance, appointing Craig Fuehrer as global head of maritime industries in addition to his role as head of transportation industries across the Americas. At the same time Michael Zolotas becomes head of maritime industries across EMEA, while Peter Illingworth continues in his role as head of maritime industries in Asia Pacific. Klaus Stoltenberg becomes chairman of the global shipping business, having hitherto been global head of the same unit. Deutsche Bank is also seeking to develop more cooperation among its funds teams, replicating a similar structure to that implemented by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan where private equity teams work alongside those focusing on sovereign wealth funds, pension funds and family offices. As a result two managing directors focusing on sovereign wealth funds and pension funds, Evans Haji-Touma in London and Ashok Pandit in Hong Kong, will report to Mike Walsh and Adam Bagshaw globally, who act as co-heads of private equity across the world, and to Alasdair Warren and James McMurdo regionally.

The options market is implying a move of around 3.1 percent in either direction for shares of Citigroup. That's slightly less than the stock's average one-day move of 3.5 percent. Shares of Citigroup have rallied 16 percent in the last three months. JPMorgan is also expected to see a less-than-average move when it reports earnings Friday morning. Options traders are anticipating a 2.4 percent move up or down versus its average of 2.7 percent. Even embattled lending giant Wells Fargo could see less volatile post-earnings trade. The options market is implying a mere 2 percent move compared to its average of 3.5 percent in either direction. However, it does appear at least one trader is expecting that move to be lower. In a sizable trade Monday, someone purchased 30,000 of the November 40-strike puts for 21 cents each. This is a bearish bet that Wells Fargo could fall below $39.80 in a little more than a month. Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo make up nearly 25 percent of the XLF financial ETF and despite more muted expectations for the third quarter, if all three of the moves were to come to fruition it could represent a $16 billion trade for the financial sector. Financials are the second-best-performing sector over the last three months, up more than 4 percent.

The pullback on the day extends the back-and-forth trend shown by the markets over the past few weeks. Currently, the major averages are lingering near their worst levels of the day. The Dow is down 177.19 points or 1 percent at 18,151.85, the Nasdaq is down 67.17 points or 1.3 percent at 5,261.50 and the S&P 500 is down 22.97 points or 1.1 percent at 2,140.69. A negative reaction to earnings news from Alcoa (AA) is weighing on the markets, with the aluminum giant slumping by 9.9 percent. The drop by shares of Alcoa comes after the company reported third quarter earnings and revenues that came in below analyst estimates. The release of quarterly results from Alcoa is seen as the unofficial start of earnings season, with financial giants Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) due to report their results later this week. Light trading activity may be exaggerating the downward move by the markets amid another quiet day in terms of major U.S. economic news. Traders may be staying on the sidelines ahead of the release of closely watched reports on retail sales and producer prices on Friday. The minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting due on Wednesday are also likely to attract attention amid lingering uncertainty about the outlook for monetary policy. Sector News Biotechnology stocks have moved sharply lower over the course of the trading session, resulting in a 3.1 percent drop by the NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index. The decline has pulled the index down to its lowest intraday level in over two months. Illumina (ILMN) has led the biotech sector lower, plunging by 24.4 percent after cutting its third quarter revenue guidance. Considerable weakness is also visible among electronic storage stocks, as reflected by the 3.1 percent loss being posted by the NYSE Arca Disk Drive Index. Seagate Technology (STX) has fallen sharply despite providing upbeat guidance. Semiconductor stocks have also come under pressure on the day, dragging the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index down by 2.1 percent. The index is pulling back further off the sixteen-year closing high it set last Thursday Health care, natural gas, networking, and brokerage stocks are also seeing significant weakness, moving lower along with most of the other major sectors. Other Markets In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index jumped by 1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled by 1.3 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets all moved to the downside on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index slid by 0.6 percent, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index and the German DAX Index both fell by 0.4 percent. In the bond market, treasuries have climbed off their worst levels but continue to see modest weakness. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by 2.7 basis points at 1.750 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America These Companies Are Sitting On Mountains Of Cash More Top Stories European Shares Seen Up Despite Weak Asian Cues China's Industrial Output, Retail Sales Rise Less Than Forecast Asian Markets Mostly Lower AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet Stocks Close Mixed On The Day But Sharply Higher For The Week - U.S. Commentary VP-Elect Pence To Take Over As Head Of Trump Transition Team Airlines Struggle With Computer Glitch Trump To Drop Out Of Trans-Pacific Partnership Within First 100 Days Gohmert Says Congress Can Help Fund Border Wall Singles Day: Alibaba Sales Skyrocket Pence Holds "Warm And Professional" Meeting With Biden Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness Following Post-Election Rally - U.S. Commentary Stocks Turning In Lackluster Performance In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy GrubHub CEO: I Did Not Tell Trump Supporters To Quit <<Previous        135 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America Continental Stock Dips On Weak Q3 Profit; Sees Strong Earnings In Q4 AstraZeneca Q3 Pre-tax Profit Down On Crestor Generic; Backs FY View Alphabet Cancels Drone Deal With Starbucks As Project Leaders Pushed Out Viacom Q4 Adj.

The Ticker Tape , TD Ameritrade   {{following ? "Following" : "Follow"}} October 11, 2016 11:02am   Comments Share: Let the earnings games begin. Alcoa Inc (NYSE: AA) surprised Wall Street ahead of the open today by announcing results earlier than scheduled and that fell short of expectations. The markets, already sloping downward apparently tied to a fallback in oil prices, slid further after the results were announced. Is that a harbinger of what’s ahead on the earnings front? AA’s profit, expected at $0.33 a share, missed analysts’ projections by $0.02 cents. Shares sank as much as 7% in pre-market activity, wiping out this year’s gain of 6.4% and then some. Investors had not expected to see the Q3 results until after the bell. Many analysts see the quarter’s cumulative on the S&P 500 (SPX) results coming in lower yet again, marking the fifth straight quarter of declining earnings, according to CFRA Research. But if corporations continue to outpace Wall Street’s expectations as many have in recent years, that could sway those numbers to the upside, according to some analysts. “If we can somehow get to flat in earnings, that would be very supportive of equity markets in general,” Jon Adams, an investment strategist at BMO Global Asset management, told the Wall Street Journal. “At some point, we need to see top-line growth to justify (current) valuations.” We’ve got a good six weeks to see if that pans out and it’s far too early in the season to make any kind of well-informed prognostications on that. Plus, while AA has the time-honored distinction of leading the earnings parade (though a handful of companies already have reported), many analysts say they look to Friday’s results from major banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) and Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE: WFC) to be the true start of the third-quarter wrap up. It also will be the first time WFC is facing investors since the phony-account affair was uncovered. Market Meandering In the early going, the three major benchmarks retreated. Some analysts also blamed it on a 1% drop in U.S. oil prices after what they described as lingering doubts that Saudi Arabia and Russia will be able to make an output-freeze deal on supplies of crude oil, as promised Monday. That support for a deal from both yesterday appeared to help West Texas Intermediate (CLX6) oil futures surge 3% to close at $51.35 a barrel, a level they haven’t seen since July 2015. Early on today, futures were still holding above the key $50-mark but had lost some 1%. As apparent in Monday’s rally, the correlation between crude-oil prices and the S&P 500’s (SPX) looked to be in play again. On Monday the SPX energy index spiked as did the Dow Jones Industrials (DJIA), led by robust turns to the upside by components Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX), the Dow’s biggest advancers. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 index set a fresh peak with yesterday’s rally. All three were lower at the open. Among more notable movers Monday were shares of Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR), losing another 12% after talks of a takeover fizzled. In the early going, shares were struggling to stay positive amid a published report that salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE: CRM) was still talking about buying the social-media firm. Meanwhile, Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) shares sped higher yesterday after Chief Executive Elon Musk sent a message on Twitter—which some market pundits called “tweet talking” investors—dismissing the company’s need to raise capital in Q4. That appeared to be in contrast to statement in a Securities and Exchange filing from Friday in which it said it “is currently planning to raise additional funds by the end of the year.” Stay tuned. Small Business Confidence Rattled. Like the stock market, small-business confidence goes up and goes down. Small-business owners’ comfort and optimism about their economic states stumbled in September, marking the second month of slippage after posting its most upbeat assessment in July, according to a national trade group. For September, the National Federation of Independent Business’ small-business optimism index stood at 94.1 compared with August’s 94.4 stance and July’s 94.6 level. That was another miss on Wall Street’s expectations, which were at 95. The results of the 10 components weighed were split with five up and five down, but declines in job openings, inventory satisfaction, and plans for inventory investments appeared to outweigh a better outlook on business conditions. The index is often referred to by economists for its readings on hiring and wage trends. Global Issues, According to Goldman. Some 400 attendees at Goldman Sachs Growth Markets Conference last weekend were queried on their thoughts on some of the key issues challenging the global economy. The responses, among investors, policymakers and government officials across the world were varied, of course. But Goldman grouped the key takeaways together and here are the biggest concerns: Nearly 70% called the Federal Reserve’s low-interest policy “worrisome” to financial imbalances, noting that the worse-case scenario was “too much ‘reach for yield’ in spread markets.” That underscores what many market analysts have been saying for some time, that the search for yield may be among the reasons behind this year’s rallies that may not have been supported by basic fundamentals. Some 45% think higher yielding assets, including emerging markets, will be most at risk if the Fed goes beyond its current projected path of interest-rate hikes. More than 50% say China’s economy, a long-time engine of global growth, will slow down next year. But 93% see Brazil’s engines firing up to move its economy into positive territory next year. Yes, a Robot Will Take Your Job. But don’t worry, be prepared. That’s the advice from Christine Lagarde, the International Monetary Fund’s managing director. In a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal, Lagarde said the IMF is stepping up efforts to get its 189-member group well equipped to embrace and capitalize on technology at a time when global economic growth is “fairly bleak, fragile and certainly insufficient,” she told WSJ in a videotaped interview. “There is clearly a fear and anxiety that robots are going to take over the jobs and that is going to create significant unemployment,” she said. “But this is something that we have seen over and over in the last so many centuries where a breakthrough in technology, a significant innovation, creates fear and anxiety, does eliminate jobs. “But by the same token, new jobs are created,” she added. “The real challenge is how do we prepare…how do we retain those whose jobs will be eliminated by robots to make sure that we don’t have more inequality and more disruption.” Prepare with new training and education for new opportunities, she added.   TD Ameritrade and all third parties mentioned are separate and unaffiliated companies, and are not responsible for each other’s policies or services.

The major averages fell at the start of trading and have seen some further downside since then. Currently, the major averages are just off their lows of the young session. The Dow is down 125.12 points or 0.7 percent at 18,203.92, the Nasdaq is down 40.87 points or 0.8 percent at 5,287.81 and the S&P 500 is down 16.71 points or 0.8 percent at 2,146.95. A negative reaction to earnings news from Alcoa (AA) is weighing on the markets, with the aluminum giant slumping by 10.4 percent. The drop by shares of Alcoa comes after the company reported third quarter earnings and revenues that came in below analyst estimates. The release of quarterly results from Alcoa is seen as the unofficial start of earnings season, with financial giants Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) due to report their results later this week. Nonetheless, overall trading activity has remained somewhat subdued amid another quiet day in terms of major U.S. economic news. Traders may be staying on the sidelines ahead of the release of closely watched reports on retail sales and producer prices on Friday. The minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting due on Wednesday are also likely to attract attention amid lingering uncertainty about the outlook for monetary policy. Electronic storage stocks have shown a substantial move to the downside, dragging the NYSE Arca Disk Drive Index down by 2.7 percent. Seagate Technology (STX) is leading the sector lower despite providing upbeat guidance. Biotechnology, semiconductor, gold, and health care stocks are also seeing significant weakness, moving lower along with most of the other major sectors. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index jumped by 1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled by 1.3 percent. The major European markets have also turned mixed on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has edged down by 0.1 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index are up by 0.1 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively. In the bond market, treasuries have come under pressure, extending a recent downward trend. As a result, the yield on the benchmark ten-year note, which moves opposite of its price, is up by 3.9 basis points at 1.762 percent. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America These Companies Are Sitting On Mountains Of Cash More Commentary -Global European Shares Seen Up Despite Weak Asian Cues Indian Markets Closed For Public Holiday Asian Markets Mostly Lower Thai Bourse Draws Flat Lead For Monday Indonesia Shares May Find Traction On Monday Hong Kong Shares May Find Support On Monday China Bourse May Flirt With 3,200-Point Level Little Movement Expected For Taiwan Bourse Singapore Market May See Support At 2,800 Points Malaysia Stock Market To Remain Rangebound South Korea Shares May Be Stuck In Neutral Stocks Close Mixed On The Day But Sharply Higher For The Week - U.S. Commentary Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness Following Post-Election Rally - U.S. Commentary European Markets Finish Mostly Lower As Trump Rally Fizzles Stocks Turning In Lackluster Performance In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary <<Previous        118 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America Continental Stock Dips On Weak Q3 Profit; Sees Strong Earnings In Q4 AstraZeneca Q3 Pre-tax Profit Down On Crestor Generic; Backs FY View Alphabet Cancels Drone Deal With Starbucks As Project Leaders Pushed Out Viacom Q4 Adj.

South Africa’s rand tumbled after prosecutors said they will charge the nation’s finance minister with fraud. The greenback jumped to its strongest level in more than two months against the euro and approached a more than five-week high versus the yen as Fed Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said policy “may well be changing soon.” Treasury two-year note yields rose to the highest in more than four months and the rand tumbled the most since June. Sam sung Electronics Co led Asian stocks lower, with the company saying after markets closed that it was ending production of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones. US crude oil retreated from the highest in 15 months. The dollar has been supported by speculation that the US economy is strong enough to withstand higher borrowing costs, with the market-implied odds of an increase this year rising to 67 per cent. Markets will get more clues on policy makers’ thinking tomorrow with the release of the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s September 20-21 meeting. A government report Friday will show retail sales rebounded in September, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. “You do have US data holding up better than many expected and markets are still looking for the Fed to raise rates in December,” said Thomas Harr, global head of FICC research at Copenhagen-based Danske Bank A/S. “Over the next couple of weeks you could see a bit more dollar strength.” Currencies The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, a gauge of the greenback against 10 major peers, rose 0.4 per cent as of 8.11am New York time, set for its highest closing level since July 25. The index has gained in six of the past seven trading days as wagers on higher rates become more entrenched. The greenback advanced for a second day versus the euro, appreciating 0.6 per cent to US$1.1078 (RM4.63), and was 0.1 per cent firmer at ¥103.73 (RM4.18). The South African rand led declines among major currencies, dropping 3.5 to 14.2863 per dollar, while the nation’s bonds also slumped. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan was summoned to appear in court on fraud charges next month, the latest twist in a struggle with President Jacob Zuma that could cause the country’s credit rating to be downgraded to junk. The case is politically motivated and South Africans need to ask why it was filed just weeks before the delivery of the mid-term budget, Gordhan said in a speech delivered in Midrand near Johannesburg today. The pound fell for a fourth day, with the its precipitous slide prompting strategists from ING Groep NV, JPMorgan & Chase Co and Julius Baer Group Ltd to revise down their longer-term predictions. Sterling has been hurt as investors await clarity from Prime Minister Theresa May’s government on how the nation will manage its exit from the European Union. The pound dropped 0.7 per cent to US$1.2276. Sweden’s krona slumped to its weakest level in more than six years as a report showed the nation’s annual inflation rate unexpectedly dropped in September. The currency lost as much as 1 per cent to 9.7354 per euro, the weakest level since May 2010. It depreciated 1.5 per cent to 8.7828 per dollar. China’s yuan fell 0.04 per cent offshore, taking its eight-day loss to 0.7 per cent. The currency joined the International Monetary Fund’s reserves basket on October 1. Onshore, the yuan fell to a six-year low. Stocks The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 0.1 per cent. LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE rose 5 per cent after reporting sales that topped analysts’ estimates. Christian Dior SE and Burberry Group Plc advanced at least 3 per cent. S&P 500 Index futures declined 0.3 per cent, after US equities closed up 0.5 per cent yesterday as surging oil boosted energy producers. Alcoa Inc fell 4.2 per cent in early trading in New York after reporting third-quarter earnings that trailed analysts’ profit estimates. The company unofficially kicked off the earnings season, which will turn investors’ attention to the health of US companies. Analysts forecast a 1.6 per cent contraction in three-month profit for S&P 500 members, which would be a sixth straight quarterly drop. The FTSE 100 Index of stocks reached an intraday record as concern that the UK’s government’s approach to Brexit will preclude membership of the EU single market spurred more declines in the pound, boosting companies with foreign earnings. The index jumped as much as 0.5 per cent. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell 0.6 per cent, set for its biggest decline in more than a week. South Korea’s Kospi index slid 1.2 per cent, its worst performance this month, as Samsung tumbled 8 per cent, erasing US$17 billion from its market value. Saudi Arabia’s equity gauge climbed 1.5 per cent after oil prices rallied yesterday. The kingdom unveiled long-awaited plans to hold investor meetings from this week for a possible bond sale to help shore up the country’s finances. Bonds Yields on Treasury notes due in two years increased four basis points to 0.87 per cent, the highest since June. 3. Ten-year note yields rose five basis points to 1.77 per cent. Trading resumed after the Columbus Day bond-market holiday yesterday. Even as he argued for keeping interest rates low until core inflation moves higher, Evans repeated an observation he made last week that policy may change soon. Officials left their benchmark interest rate unchanged in September, though the decision came over the objection of three voters who favoured a hike. Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer on Sunday called it a “close call.” The decline in Treasuries is also being driven by the willingness of Saudi Arabia and Russia to cooperate on an oil output deal, said John Gorman, head of non-yen rates trading for Asia and the Pacific at Nomura Holdings Inc in Tokyo. Higher oil prices tend to boost inflation, which erodes the value of the fixed payments on bonds. European government bonds rose, with the yield on benchmark German 10-year bunds falling one basis point to 0.049 per cent. The yield on similar-dated UK gilts fell five basis points to 0.98 per cent. Asian government debt dropped, with yields on 10-year Australian bonds up six basis points to 2.25 per cent and yields on similar maturity notes in Japan climbing 1.5 basis points. Commodities West Texas Intermediate crude slipped 0.6 per cent to US$51.04 a barrel after jumping 3.1 per cent last session to its highest closing price since July 2015. Brent fell 0.9 per cent to US$52.69 per barrel. Oil has gained almost 15 per cent since the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries provisionally agreed last month to cut production for the first time in eight years. The group’s members meet this week in Istanbul for talks on implementing the deal and Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said it’s not unthinkable prices will rise to US$60 a barrel by the end of this year. Zinc led industrial metals lower, falling 2.1 per cent to US$2,280 per metric ton. Tin slid 0.8 per cent. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Ringgit opens lower against US dollar One less haven for investors as Trump damages Denmark’s appeal Duterte outbursts start scaring US companies, industry says KL shares lower in early trade Dollar advances on Trump bets as Japanese shares buoyed by GDP Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Popularity becomes curse for Malaysia, Indonesia currencies US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: F1 fans watch as Hamilton wins for first time in Brazil Reuters Video: Two killed as powerful earthquake hits New Zealand Reuters Video: Supermoon rises in Spain Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Related Articles In Trump tantrum, emerging markets are down but not yet out Dollar advances on Trump bets as Japanese shares buoyed by GDP Dollar on high as US yields rise, Asia shares mixed Expected inflation pop from Trump win pushes dollar to best week in a year The fears of the undocumented in the time of Trump (VIDEO) Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

As oil prices rose to a one-year high on Monday and Donald Trump’s presidential bid was hit by furore over a 2005 video, the kingdom unveiled long-awaited plans to hold investor meetings in London, Los Angeles, Boston and New York from Wednesday. Saudi Arabia may sell bonds maturing in five, 10 and 30 years, joining a wave of developing nations raising cash before the November ballot and as Federal Reserve interest-rate hikes draw closer. “It’s very good timing,” said Angelo Rossetto, a trader at GMSA Investments Ltd. in London, who will consider buying the longest-dated tranche. “I wouldn’t say now or never as they will always have huge demand for any issuance, but the combination of oil, rates and elections make it the right time.” The meetings show that the bond sale, said to be at least $10 billion in size, hasn’t been derailed by a US vote last month that allows families of 9/11 victims to sue the Saudi government. The world’s biggest oil-exporter is seizing on momentum from an agreement by Opec to limit production that sent crude prices past $50 a barrel, giving it a chance to drum up cash to fill a budget shortfall near the widest in more than two decades. Saudi Arabia hired Citigroup Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. as global coordinators and added seven other managers from Japan and China to Germany and France. Sovereign borrowers from the developing world including Russia and Argentina have already sold $15 billion since Sept. 1, the most since the same period in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The prevalence of negative rates in Europe and Japan and a slow path to tightening by the Fed has fuelled demand for higher-yielding assets. Brent crude jumped 2.3 per cent on Monday to $53.14 per barrel, the highest level since August 2015. “The timing looks good since the US elections are still five weeks away, the oil price is stabilising and risk appetite is good with moderate supply in markets at the moment — normally, a sweet spot to print a deal,” said Sergey Dergachev, a senior money manager at Union Investment Privatfonds GmbH in Frankfurt, which oversees about $13 billion. Paltry Yields For some investors, Saudi Arabia’s investment-grade rating will work as a deterrent unless the country offers yields comparable to other Gulf borrowers. “The deal is unlikely to favour investors on a risk-reward basis as there is still a debate as to how strong Saudi Arabia’s rating should be compared to its neighbours,” said Anders Faergemann, senior portfolio manager at PineBridge Investments Europe Ltd. in London. “Yields on offer are likely to be low.” Moody’s Investors Service cut Saudi Arabia’s credit rating to A1 in May, the fifth-highest investment grade, saying “lower oil prices have led to a material deterioration in” creditworthiness. That’s seven steps above neighbouring Bahrain, which sold $2 billion of bonds due in seven and 12 years last week, paying as much as 7 per cent. “I am reluctant to buy Saudi Arabia, I think there are other oil stories out there that sound more compelling,” said Peter Schottmueller, the head of emerging-market and international fixed income at Deka Investment GmbH in Frankfurt, who helps manage $13 billion and holds the sovereign debt of Bahrain and Iraq. “Why buy Saudi Arabia when you can buy Bahrain sovereigns at a decent spread?” Borrowing Spree Debt issuance across the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council climbed to a record $47 billion this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, including Qatar’s $9 billion sale in May that was a record for the Middle East. Some governments in the region are on a borrowing spree to fill fiscal gaps the International Monetary Fund says could reach $900 billion by 2021. Saudi Arabia in May completed a $10 billion loan from a group of US, European, Japanese and Chinese banks. Its direct local debt was $63 billion as of the end of August, of which $25.1 billion was raised this year, according to information in the Saudi bond prospectus obtained by Bloomberg. The kingdom plans to use proceeds from the debt sale to help fund an economic transformation plan that includes reductions to allowances and bonuses of some state employees, delayed payments owed to contractors and lower fuel subsidies. The government may also sell a stake in oil giant Saudi Arabian Oil Co., or Aramco, and create the world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund. The nation sees its oil reserves lasting about 70 years, according to the prospectus. The deal comes weeks before a US election that threatens to stoke market volatility. Among Trump’s most inflammatory proposals, he suggested greater scrutiny of Muslims and has said he’s not “a big fan” of Saudi Arabia. The securities will be available to US investors through Rule 144a, following inflows of about $42 billion into emerging-market bond funds this year that reversed three years of outflows, according to EPFR Global. “This may not be too attractive long term, but short term there’s a trade to jump on,” said Rossetto at GMSA.

A total of 27 lenders joined the 12-month deal including European and Japanese banks, according to information from people familiar with the matter, who are not authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be identified. Bank of America Corp., Credit Suisse Group AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co. are arranging the loan deal, the people said. Bayer is set to buy St Louis-based Monsanto for $66 billion, the biggest takeover agreed to worldwide this year and a record overseas acquisition for a German company.

The major index futures are currently pointing to a lower open for the markets, with the Dow futures down by 42 points. A negative reaction to earnings news from Alcoa (AA) may weigh on the markets, with the aluminum giant slumping by 4.2 percent in pre-market trading. The drop by shares of Alcoa comes after the company reported third quarter earnings and revenues that came in below analyst estimates. The release of quarterly results from Alcoa is seen as the unofficial start of earnings season, with financial giants Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) due to report their results later this week. Nonetheless, overall trading activity may remain somewhat subdued amid another quiet day in terms of major U.S. economic news. Traders may be reluctant to make significant moves ahead of the release of closely watched reports on retail sales and producer prices on Friday. The minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting due on Wednesday are also likely to attract attention amid lingering uncertainty about the outlook for monetary policy. After moving to the downside in the previous week, stocks regained some ground over the course of the trading session on Monday. The major averages ended the day in positive territory but off their highs of the session. The Dow climbed 88.55 points or 0.5 percent to 18,329.04, the Nasdaq advanced 36.27 points or 0.7 percent to 5,328.67 and the S&P 500 rose 9.92 points or 0.5 percent to 2,163.66. In overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index jumped by 1 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled by 1.3 percent. Meanwhile, the major European markets have all moved to the upside on the day. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has edged up by 0.2 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index are both up by 0.3 percent. In commodities trading, crude oil futures are slipping $0.35 to $51 a barrel after ending Monday's session up $1.54 at $51.35 a barrel, the highest closing level since July of 2015. An ounce of gold is currently trading at $1,257.10, down $3.30 from the previous session's close of $1,260.40. On Monday, gold rose $8.90, snapping a 6-session losing streak. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 103.72 yen compared to the 103.61 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Monday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1083 compared to yesterday's $1.1139. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Business News Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Forget Canada: The Best Places To Flee Trump's America These Companies Are Sitting On Mountains Of Cash More Top Stories European Shares Seen Up Despite Weak Asian Cues China's Industrial Output, Retail Sales Rise Less Than Forecast Asian Markets Mostly Lower AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet Stocks Close Mixed On The Day But Sharply Higher For The Week - U.S. Commentary VP-Elect Pence To Take Over As Head Of Trump Transition Team Airlines Struggle With Computer Glitch Trump To Drop Out Of Trans-Pacific Partnership Within First 100 Days Gohmert Says Congress Can Help Fund Border Wall Singles Day: Alibaba Sales Skyrocket Pence Holds "Warm And Professional" Meeting With Biden Stocks Seeing Modest Weakness Following Post-Election Rally - U.S. Commentary Stocks Turning In Lackluster Performance In Early Trading - U.S. Commentary Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy GrubHub CEO: I Did Not Tell Trump Supporters To Quit <<Previous        135 Articles Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Nasty Gal Files For Bankruptcy Allianz Stock Climbs On Q3 Profit Growth, Confirms FY16 Profit View Walt Disney Q4 Profit Down - Update Forget Canada: The Best Places To Escape Trump's America Continental Stock Dips On Weak Q3 Profit; Sees Strong Earnings In Q4 AstraZeneca Q3 Pre-tax Profit Down On Crestor Generic; Backs FY View Alphabet Cancels Drone Deal With Starbucks As Project Leaders Pushed Out Viacom Q4 Adj.
