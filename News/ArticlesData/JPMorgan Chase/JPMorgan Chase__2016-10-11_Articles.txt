This round was led by JPMorgan Chase & Co., with ICAP, Barclays and Point72 Ventures. The round also includes individual participation by the principals of several leading trading firms, such as Hudson Ridge Asset Management, who were among Cloud9's early customers. "We are thrilled to welcome Point72 Ventures and our other investors as we continue to build a technology that acts as a catalyst in terms of changing the communication and process around trading," said Gerald Starr, CEO of Cloud9 Technologies. "Cloud9 has ushered trader communication into the modern age, while bringing mobility, enhanced compliance and security, and more agile communication to the industry. With the close of this round, our team is poised to continue development of products and services that will change the way the financial industry and enterprise businesses communicate and collaborate." To date, more than 2,700 users in 29 countries have adopted Cloud9. Firms have cited several reasons for Cloud9's popularity among financial services professionals, including the platform's ease-of-use, mobility features, strong value proposition and interoperability with other solutions. "Cloud9's technology inspired us to revisit our trader voice communication strategy and related workflow," said Rick Smith, Head of Private Investments at JPMorgan Chase. "We believe that Cloud9 will empower traders through its ease of use and management, while improving efficiency, enhancing compliance and reducing communications costs." Cloud9 will use the funding to support innovation, accelerate the development of several products in great demand by its customer base and expand the service offering into new markets. Most recently, Cloud9 opened an office in Singapore to meet growing demand in the Asia Pacific region, and the company has plans to expand operations in other markets by early next year. "The rapid growth of Cloud9 since the company's launch in 2014 has paralleled the industry's adoption of cloud technology and we've seen the opportunity to extend the platform's benefits into areas such as workflow, compliance and advanced analytics," said Richard Kerschner, Chief Corporate Development Officer of ICAP's Post Trade, Risk and Information Services Division."Cloud9 is best positioned to provide next generation solutions that will create improved efficiency and additional benefits for traders, brokers, and other financial market players." ICAP's participation was led by Euclid Opportunities, ICAP's investment arm focused on emerging fintech companies. "We believe Cloud9 is an emerging leader in transforming the way the buy-side and sell-side communicate across the capital markets," said Pete Casella, Partner at Point72 Ventures. "We are excited to partner with Jerry and his team to help attract more of our peers and trading counterparts into the Cloud9 ecosystem." "We have been using Cloud9 since the beginning," said Michael Intrator, President and CEO of Hudson Ridge Asset Management, LLC. "We chose to personally invest in Cloud9 because the technology has been reliable, and transformative for us. We believe that the company has a future that extends beyond creating an integrated lifecycle around trading communications and beyond the finance industry." In July, Cloud9 announced the successful launch of its Gateway Service, which connects Cloud9 users to their counterparties, even if they are not yet using the Cloud9 application. This kind of interoperability gives traders and brokers an edge, allowing them to connect with counterparties that they otherwise might not have had access to via the Cloud9 community. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz served as legal advisor to Cloud9 in connection with the funding round, which commenced earlier in 2016.

"Bond valuations are obviously very, very high for various reasons. We have seen contagion into the equity space," he told CNBC's "Power Lunch." That's because investors in search of yield have moved into stocks that pay dividends, causing the market to be "dislocated," he added. At this point, Lakos-Bujas believes diversification makes a lot of sense. However, historically that means investing in both bonds and equities. "Today I think one of the hidden risks that we face is that if yields start to creep higher, especially if they start to creep higher for nongrowth reasons, be it central bank related, you could see bonds potentially getting deflated and you could see equities being pressurized, which means cash." JPMorgan has said it expects the S&P 500 to end the year at 2,000, with market leaders poised for the biggest fall. It also projects some sector laggards to do relatively better, such as health care. "We basically see superior growth in health care, on one hand. On the other hand, we see relatively attractive valuations," Lakos-Bujas said. — CNBC's Tom DiChristopher contributed to this report.

That's the amount of investment the global financial services firm gave to the LiftUp loan program, which aims to reduce approval times for small business loans, help small businesses grow and dent unemployment rates, the firm said Tuesday. "Increasing access to capital is vital to the success of small businesses -- and to the economic growth of our communities," JPMorgan Chase credit risk director for Central Texas Ken Sample said in a statement. "It's also a key component of JPMorgan Chase's commitment to help women-, minority- and veteran-owned business grow, gain access to capital and create jobs," said Sample, who also is a board member of LiftFund, a San Antonio-based small business support organization. "That's why we are proud to expand our partnership with LiftFund to help close this funding gap for the small businesses that need it most." The program targets businesses in Houston, Atlanta, Austin, Dallas, New Orleans and San Antonio.

The search for sustainable dividend payers in an unpredictable market By Clare Hart, Portfolio Manager for JPMorgan Equity Income Fund at J.P.

Why does an income-oriented approach make sense in today’s environment? Dividend investing is an attractive way to capture return throughout the market cycle. If you’re investing for the long term, you should consider stocks with both growth in their underlying business and an above-market dividend yield. We have found that, over time, this combination allows an investor to capture both sources of a stock’s return—capital appreciation and dividend income. Today’s steady economic backdrop, with the potential for a bounce in corporate profits this year, is a great environment for a stock picker to identify attractively-valued companies that can grow their business. Where are you currently finding your most attractive opportunities? Some of our highest-conviction positions are financial stocks, where reduced expectations for interest rate hikes this year are creating bargains by causing investors to exit names in the sector. Across the banking industry we’re finding opportunities across both large banks and regional banks. A regional bank we particularly like is BB&T, BBT 1.0381458232737808% BB&T Corp. U.S.: NYSE USD41.85 0.43 1.0381458232737808% /Date(1478901744626-0600)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 9990179 AFTER HOURS USD41.85 % Volume (Delayed 15m) : 207092 P/E Ratio 15.5 Market Cap 33958093631.8603 Dividend Yield 2.867383512544803% Rev. per Employee 298011 More quote details and news » BBT in Your Value Your Change Short position a southern-focused franchise with a high dividend yield. BB&T maintains a diversified business model on a product and a geographical basis, which should reduce earnings volatility, while it has augmented its organic growth with well-thought-out acquisitions that complement its existing geographic footprint. As a result, BB&T is focusing on growing its franchise in states with steady population growth, such as Florida and Texas, while expanding into new markets in the south and Midwest. We’re also finding pockets of opportunity within high dividend-yielding sectors, such as consumer staples, utilities and REITs. However, valuations are rich, payout ratios are higher, and growth opportunities for the businesses tend to be lower. Therefore, the potential total return from investing in companies with attractive dividend yields and lower payout ratios, such as financials, is much better. Our focus on identifying stocks with a modest payout ratio is a key part of our investment process, as these companies retain enough capital after paying dividends to invest for future growth, providing us with both a growing stream of dividends and capital appreciation potential. How are you finding value in volatile sectors? In more volatile sectors, such as energy, we focus on seeking out companies that can return capital to shareholders throughout the cycle. For example, we like to own high-quality established names, such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron, which have strong balance sheets and can survive the persistent volatility in the oil market, while also being in a position to benefit when oil prices eventually stabilize. Industrials is another volatile sector, where we are able to find high-quality companies that operate in longer cycle, higher value-add industries. Companies like 3M and Honeywell—which are able to deliver products with technological advances into more traditionally-cyclical end markets—can be longer-term winners. Why should investors consider this high-quality approach to value investing? In today’s market, which we believe will strengthen as the year goes on and as we move into next year, it’s an ideal environment to seek out companies that can grow their business and add shareholder value. And an investment approach that blends income investing with capital appreciation can not only seek out these attractive opportunities, but also lead to a fund with lower volatility than the broader market. With its income approach to equities focusing on high-quality companies with healthy and sustainable dividend yields, learn more about how JPMorgan Equity Income Fund can boost returns in today’s challenging environment.

US citizen Joshua Samuel Aaron, wanted in the US for stealing data on 100 million clients of the JPMorgan Chase bank, has asked for political asylum in Russia only to see his request turned down, a source in the law enforcement has told TASS. Read also Moscow says US threats of sanctions for 'cyberattacks' are provocative "The US national in question, currently at a special detention center for foreign nationals pending deportation, has asked Russia for political asylum. In his home country he is faced with a 170-year prison term. His request has been turned down, but he has protested the ruling, so now the decision in favor of his deportation has been suspended until courts pronounce the final verdict regarding his request and the decision takes effect," the source explained. Shortly after his detention Aaron started complaining about his health problems, but the court found that the presented documentary evidence was not convincing enough. Earlier on Tuesday Bloomberg said that Aaron, whom the United States holds responsible for a cyberattack against JPMorgan Chase, is kept in custody at a detention center for illegal migrants in Moscow and is negotiating his return home. The agency said Aaron’s lawyers and the US authorities might come to terms by the end of this month. Aaron has dismissed the cyberattack charges. He declared he knew nothing about the warrant for his arrest issued in the United States. His relatives have confirmed the very instance of negotiations but would not elaborate. Detention and deportation decision The Moscow police detained Joshua Aaron in May 2016, when in the process of an ID check he failed to present a valid passport. He had arrived in Russia from Ukraine on May 23, 2015, several weeks before the issue of a warrant for his arrest in the United States.

The court fined him 5,000 rubles (roughly $80) and ordered expulsion. He was taken to a detention center for foreign nationals until the expulsion decision would take effect. Police detained Aaron in the center of Moscow. He carried no passport, migration card or visa (his previous six-month visa had expired by then). On June 2 the Moscow City Court turned down his appeal and upheld the deportation decision. Bloomberg on Tuesday said that according to investigators Joshua Aaron and Israeli citizens Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein before October 2014 carried out a number of cyberattacks against JPMorgan chase to steal data on more than 100 million clients. On the list of the fraudsters’ victims were a number of financial companies in New York, Boston (Massachusetts), Omaha (Nebraska) and St. Louis (Missouri). The stolen data allowed the hackers to get unauthorized access to bank accounts. Shalon and Orenstein were detained in Israel last summer and extradited to the United States. JPMorgan Chase earlier said the cyberattack against its systems was one of the worst in the whole history of the United States. President Barack Obama pledged to personally monitor progress in the investigation, media said. {{item.group_date}} {{item.suffix?", "+item.suffix:""}} Show more Share Topics Foreign policy Top News November 13, 16:17 Foreign ministry’s spokeswoman translates Stoltenberg into "comprehensible" language November 13, 16:17 November 13, 18:50 International military drills 'Slavic Brotherhood' closed near Belgrade November 13, 18:50 November 13, 16:20 Crimea to supply gas to Ukraine’s town till March - legislator November 13, 16:20 November 13, 11:23 Erdogan says protests in US only temporary November 13, 11:23 In other media Реклама Photo 4 Crimea’s ex-prosecutor Poklonskaya takes helm at State Duma’s Commission on MPs’ income 4 Putin: Uzbek people can count on Russia’s support 3 Russia's Kirov Region governor detained on suspicion of taking €0.4 mln bribe Infographics Russia's gas pipelines to Europe by 2018 Russia’s state defense order in 2015 Chinese Lunar Exploration Program Russia’s Angara A5 heavy-load space carrier rocket Most read Now Today This week 1 Putin reiterates Russian Armed Forces not threatening anybody 2 Foreign ministry’s spokeswoman translates Stoltenberg into "comprehensible" language 3 Igor Dodon standing for closer relations with Russia leading Moldovan presidential polls 4 Formidable Sarmat: Satan’s successor that can pierce any defense 5 Roof of arms manufacturing plant in Yekaterinburg caves in to cause casualties 6 Moscow says attempts to accuse Russia of aid convoy attack are 'outrageous' 7 Moscow refutes media allegations about Russian air strikes near Syria’s Idlib 1 Foreign ministry’s spokeswoman translates Stoltenberg into "comprehensible" language 2 Erdogan says protests in US only temporary 3 Karjakin-Carlsen Game 2 ends in draw 4 Putin reiterates Russian Armed Forces not threatening anybody 5 Crimea to supply gas to Ukraine’s town till March - legislator 6 Crimea re-launches gas supplies to Ukrainian town 7 International military drills 'Slavic Brotherhood' closed near Belgrade 1 Dutch sub tried to approach Russian aircraft carrier in Mediterranean — defense ministry 2 Source: 16 US servicemen killed, 27 injured in fighting for Iraq’s Mosul 3 Trump elected president of the United States — live coverage 4 Putin congratulates Donald Trump on winning US presidential election 5 Russia-US discord will leave with Obama administration: lawmakers' reaction to Trump's win 6 US election results in animated graphics 7 Foreign ministry’s spokeswoman translates Stoltenberg into "comprehensible" language TOP STORIES US presidential election 2016 Conflict in Syria Russia's defense industry Oil & Gas Industry Space programs Реклама News World Russian Politics & Diplomacy Business & Economy Military & Defense Science & Space Society & Culture Sport Press Review Sections Tags Media Press Releases Infographics About us TASS TODAY AGENCY NEWS TASS HISTORY MANAGEMENT CONTACTS Services TASS-PHOTO TASS-ONLINE TASS Beta-version.

The search for sustainable dividend payers in an unpredictable market By Clare Hart, Portfolio Manager for JPMorgan Equity Income Fund at J.P.

Why does an income-oriented approach make sense in today’s environment? Dividend investing is an attractive way to capture return throughout the market cycle. If you’re investing for the long term, you should consider stocks with both growth in their underlying business and an above-market dividend yield. We have found that, over time, this combination allows an investor to capture both sources of a stock’s return—capital appreciation and dividend income. Today’s steady economic backdrop, with the potential for a bounce in corporate profits this year, is a great environment for a stock picker to identify attractively-valued companies that can grow their business. Where are you currently finding your most attractive opportunities? Some of our highest-conviction positions are financial stocks, where reduced expectations for interest rate hikes this year are creating bargains by causing investors to exit names in the sector. Across the banking industry we’re finding opportunities across both large banks and regional banks. A regional bank we particularly like is BB&T, BBT 1.0381458232737808% BB&T Corp. U.S.: NYSE USD41.85 0.43 1.0381458232737808% /Date(1478901744626-0600)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 9990179 AFTER HOURS USD41.85 % Volume (Delayed 15m) : 207092 P/E Ratio 15.5 Market Cap 33958093631.8603 Dividend Yield 2.867383512544803% Rev. per Employee 298011 More quote details and news » BBT in Your Value Your Change Short position a southern-focused franchise with a high dividend yield. BB&T maintains a diversified business model on a product and a geographical basis, which should reduce earnings volatility, while it has augmented its organic growth with well-thought-out acquisitions that complement its existing geographic footprint. As a result, BB&T is focusing on growing its franchise in states with steady population growth, such as Florida and Texas, while expanding into new markets in the south and Midwest. We’re also finding pockets of opportunity within high dividend-yielding sectors, such as consumer staples, utilities and REITs. However, valuations are rich, payout ratios are higher, and growth opportunities for the businesses tend to be lower. Therefore, the potential total return from investing in companies with attractive dividend yields and lower payout ratios, such as financials, is much better. Our focus on identifying stocks with a modest payout ratio is a key part of our investment process, as these companies retain enough capital after paying dividends to invest for future growth, providing us with both a growing stream of dividends and capital appreciation potential. How are you finding value in volatile sectors? In more volatile sectors, such as energy, we focus on seeking out companies that can return capital to shareholders throughout the cycle. For example, we like to own high-quality established names, such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron, which have strong balance sheets and can survive the persistent volatility in the oil market, while also being in a position to benefit when oil prices eventually stabilize. Industrials is another volatile sector, where we are able to find high-quality companies that operate in longer cycle, higher value-add industries. Companies like 3M and Honeywell—which are able to deliver products with technological advances into more traditionally-cyclical end markets—can be longer-term winners. Why should investors consider this high-quality approach to value investing? In today’s market, which we believe will strengthen as the year goes on and as we move into next year, it’s an ideal environment to seek out companies that can grow their business and add shareholder value. And an investment approach that blends income investing with capital appreciation can not only seek out these attractive opportunities, but also lead to a fund with lower volatility than the broader market. With its income approach to equities focusing on high-quality companies with healthy and sustainable dividend yields, learn more about how JPMorgan Equity Income Fund can boost returns in today’s challenging environment.

Joshua Aaron is the only American of a trio indicted in July 2015 for pump-and-dump schemes said to have made them millions of dollars. They’re accused of making their fortune by artificially inflating the price of penny stocks by spamming out promotional emails and then selling their shares. It’s believed that the group were involved in hacking JPMorgan and other Wall Street firms for info they could use to make their schemes more effective. Investigators had originally suspected Russian involvement in the JPMorgan attack and Aaron and former Florida State University classmate, Anthony Murgio, are known to have traveled there frequently. Now Bloomberg is reporting that Aaron, 32, was detained back in May after breaking the rules of his three-year visa. His lawyers are now in talks with US prosecutors, although Russia has no extradition treaty with the States so presumably if deported he could leave for another country. The situation highlights the problem US officials have in dealing with Russia when it comes to cybersecurity matters. The diplomatic relationship between the two could be described as ‘frosty’ at best, despite an agreement struck between presidents Obama and Putin to co-operate against cybercriminals. That’s not been helped by Washington’s assertion that Russia has been behind attempts to destabilize the country’s electoral process ahead of the presidential showdown next month. It’s more than likely that there are members of Aaron’s group that are Russian nationals – another reason for the Kremlin to be reluctant to co-operate in this case. By contrast, Aaron’s alleged co-conspirators Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein were arrested by Israeli police last summer and extradited to New York in July this year.

JPMorgan’s funds dominate trade, attracting 90pc of mainland investment flows PUBLISHED : Tuesday, 11 October, 2016, 9:48am UPDATED : Tuesday, 11 October, 2016, 10:57pm Comments:   Enoch Yiu enoch.yiu@scmp.com http://twitter.com/enochyiu Share PrintEmail Related topics Chinese Offshore Investment Related Articles Companies China’s private equity funds lead the charge into European and American markets 3 Nov 2016 Economy How Chinese buyers are soothing fears amid record spree of overseas deals 24 Oct 2016 Economy Chinese investors upbeat on prospects in Thailand despite uncertainty after king’s death 18 Oct 2016 Hong Kong domiciled funds have turned out to be wildly popular with mainland investors, who snatched up 80 times more of the investments than Hong Kong investors purchased of a reciprocal product that provides access to mainland equity markets, data for the first eight months of a new cross-border programme showed. Mainlanders channelled 8.45 billion yuan (HK$9.86 billion) to buy Hong Kong fund products on offer in the mainland over the January to August period, according to figures released by China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). The sum is 80 times the 104.59 million yuan that Hongkongers channelled into mainland funds products sold in the city. This is despite the rich offering of mainland investment products on offer in Hong Kong, as 42 mainland funds have been approved for distribution by the Securities and Futures Commission. Meanwhile, only six Hong Kong investment funds have been approved for distribution in China by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. The cross border fund sales are part of the mutual recognition scheme which started in January. JPMorgan Asset Management has won the lion’s share of the fund sales to mainland investors, receiving 7.6 billion yuan of investments through the marketing of two funds, one focused on Asian equities and the other on Asian bonds. “Hong Kong funds are popular among mainlanders as they want to invest in international products to diversify their risk,” JPMorgan’s head of China retail business Henry Tong said. He credited an effective distribution network as key to the success of the products. JPMorgan’s mainland joint venture distributes the funds through 12 mainland banks, online platforms, in addition to individual brokers. Beijing, Shanghahi, Guangzhou and second tier cities such as Chengdu are covered as part of the marketing umbrella. “Basically, we found mainlanders want to invest in fund products with a balance risk level and they want the funds invested in a number of markets to diversify risk,” Tong said. Tong said an application has been filed to gain distribution approval for a third fund offering Asian high yield equity. Although the stock connect between Hong Kong and Shanghai launched in 2014 could allow investors cross border access, Tong said it would not compete with the cross border fund scheme. Meanwhile, Hang Seng Bank said its cross-border sales of an index fund that tracks the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index has been well received. “We are happy with the sales,” Hang Seng Bank executive director Andrew Fung said without providing a sales figure. “The north bounds offer more diversification as it has bond funds, actively managed equity funds and index funds.” “The southbound funds are not too different from existing R-QFII and A-share ETFs. Falling bond yields and weak A-share performance also account for the slow sales of mainland products. The trend may persists for some time until A-shares do better,” Fung said. JPMorgan’s mainland joint venture has three mainland funds sold in Hong Kong. Elisa Ng Ka-li, head of intermediary business of JPMorgan Asset Management, said most of the southbound funds are invested in domestic mainland equities which is different from the northbound funds which offer diversification across different asset classes and geographical regions. “Given that China’s domestic equities tend to be more volatile and momentum driven, Hong Kong investors are in general sceptical towards A-shares, especially when the market for the past few months has been range bound,” Ng said. “We believe once the A-share markets regain momentum and the sentiment towards domestic A-shares improves, sales of mainland funds will gain more traction,” Ng said. Stewart Aldcroft, chairman of Cititrust, said the sales show the appeal of the funds offered by Hong Kong fund managers is far greater than those offered by mainland managers. “It is widely believed that the CSRC is slowing the processing of funds from Hong Kong for approval in China, as they fear the volumes would be even greater, possibly exceeding their expectations for the initial stages of mutual fund recognition,” Aldcroft said. “The local fund management industry would like the SFC to be far more vocal to the CSRC in moving forward on approving funds, thus to provide some help to have a wider choice of funds sold in the market,” he said. Hong Kong Investment Funds Association chief executive Sally Wong said mainland investors have limited choices when it comes to investing in overseas markets, so it’s natural for them to snap up Hong Kong funds. “Currently, mainlanders can only either put their money in savings deposits, or at the other end, A-shares or property,” Wong said.

In addition, Carle expects to issue $50 million of series 2016B taxable variable rate demand bonds. Proceeds from the series 2016 financing will be used to finance construction of new facilities, refund Carle's series 2009D variable rate demand revenue bonds and pay the costs of issuance. The series 2016A bonds will be issued as long-term fixed rate obligations and are expected to sell via negotiated sale the week of Oct. 24. In addition, Fitch has affirmed the 'AA-' long-term rating on the following revenue bonds issued by the authority on behalf of Carle: --$234.7 million series 2011A; --$7.9 million series 2009A; --$160 million series 2009B-E*. *Underlying rating. The bonds are supported by bank letters-of-credit issued by The Northern Trust Company or JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Rating Outlook is Stable. SECURITY Debt payments secured by a security interest in the gross receipts of the Obligated Group (OG; which includes the Carle Foundation, the Carle Foundation Hospital, Carle Health Care, Inc. and Carle Retirement Centers, Inc.). There is no mortgage or property pledge or debt service reserve fund. The OG represents approximately 48% of total system revenues and 77% of total system assets. KEY RATING DRIVERS FINANCIALLY STRONG, INTEGRATED SYSTEM: Fitch views as a credit strength Carle's fully integrated clinical model that includes a tertiary hospital, a large base of employed physicians, and a health plan. Despite recent softening in operating profitability due to losses within the health plan, unrestricted liquidity at June 30th remains solid at approximately $1.2 billion equating to 159% of pro forma debt. MANAGEABLE PRO FORMA DEBT BURDEN: Pro forma debt metrics, including the impact of the 2016 borrowing, are supportive of the rating. Pro forma MADS to total revenues of 1.7% compares favorably to the 'AA' category median of 2.2% for the six-month 2016 interim period. Despite compressed profitability in fiscal 2015 and through the six-month interim period, historical coverage of pro forma MADS of 4.6x and 4.1x, respectively, is adequate given Carle's market position and integrated delivery model. LEADING MARKET SHARE: Carle has further extended its leading inpatient market share position to 46.8% in 2016 from 46.3% in 2015 in its primary service area of Champaign-Urbana. Carle's market share has grown every year since 2002. In addition, most of Carle's patient volume numbers continue to show growth. CONTINUED CAPITAL SPENDING: Fitch expects capital expenditures to remain above 1x depreciation, as Carle continues to execute on its five-year capital plan. Favorably, the majority of planned projects are expected to be revenue-enhancing and no additional debt is currently planned, apart from the series 2016 borrowing. RATING SENSITIVITIES CONTINUED STRENGTH IN PERFORMANCE: Fitch expects operating performance at the Health Alliance Medical Plan (HAMP) to improve with the decision to exit the Managed Medicaid business by the end of 2016. The improvement in insurance operations combined with steady operating performance at the Carle Foundation hospitals should allow the system to move back towards financial performance more consistent with historical results. CREDIT SUMMARY Located in Urbana, IL, Carle Foundation consists of 393-bed Carle Foundation Hospital, Carle Health Care, Incorporated (which includes Carle Physician Group, comprised mostly of former Clinic physicians), Carle Retirement Centers, a 174-unit retirement center d/b/a The Windsor, and a health plan. Fitch's credit analysis is based on the results of the consolidated entity, which includes Health Alliance Medical Plans, Inc. (HAMP), a non-obligated health insurer licensed in the State of Illinois. In fiscal 2016, HAMP accounted for roughly 69% of the $2.5 billion in consolidated operating revenues. SOLID CREDIT PROFILE The 'AA-' rating reflects the strategic benefit of Carle's integrated delivery model, its growing market share position and its stable financial profile over the last few years. In 2015, on a fully consolidated basis, Carle generated income from operations of $32.7 million on total revenues of $2.5 billion (1.3% margin). Through the six months ended June 30, 2016, Carle generated operating income of $26.5 million on revenues of $1.3 billion, improving operating margin to 2.1%. On an OG-only basis, Carle generated an operating margin of 6.83% in 2015 and 9.51% in the six-month interim period. Though solid, consolidated operating margins in both fiscal 2015 and the six-month interim period of 2016 were weaker than the 5% operating margin Carle posted in fiscal 2014. Additionally, days cash on hand slipped to 173.4 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from 194.8 in fiscal 2015 and 231.3 in fiscal 2014. The biggest source of weakness in these two ratios came from HAMP, which is experiencing compressed operations due mainly to delayed payments from the State of Illinois, which remains without a budget. Approximately 47% of HAMP's premium revenues come from state insurance contracts. Management has taken proactive steps to counteract the effects of these delayed payments and shore up its operations and liquidity position. To bolster its operating margin, Carle plans to exit its Managed Medicaid business by January 2017. Carle also continues to sell its state receivables aged 90 days or more to continue to grow its liquidity position. Fitch therefore expects liquidity and profitability to improve. LIQUIDITY GROWTH At June 30, 2016, Carle had unrestricted cash and investments of approximately $1.2 billion, up from just under $1.1 billion at year-end 2013. Cushion ratio of 26.6% as of June 30, 2016 compares favorably to Fitch's 'AA'-rated median. Current cash-to-debt is also a comfortable 215.7% as of the six-month interim, but this ratio declines to 159.2% when the new money debt is factored in. The strong overall growth in unrestricted cash and investments helps offset concerns about the state of Illinois' delayed payments to HAMP. SOLID MARKET POSITION Carle has further increased its leading inpatient market share in its primary service area of Champaign County over the last six years to 46.8% in 2016 from 39.1% in 2010. Presence Covenant has the second-largest market share position at 16.7%, and that has fallen from 20.1% in 2010. Carle remains the market leader in key clinical lines, such as neurosciences, heart and vascular, oncology and women's services. Regionally, Carle continues to extend its reach through growth of clinical alignments with smaller, regional hospitals and expanding outpatient sites. HAMP also has a strong regional presence, and Carle and HAMP continue to explore regional business opportunities, as well as other potential initiatives around health care reform, including its ability to manage care coordination and control costs. HAMP has expanded into Washington State and Iowa, as well. CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS Collective proceeds from both a portion of the series 2016A bonds and a portion of the series 2016B taxable bonds will be used to finance construction of several projects that Carle identified in its five-year capital improvement plan. Major projects include a sports and orthopedic medicine center, expansion to administrative spaces for both Carle and HAMP, as well as clinical expansions at various sites. Total project costs are estimated at $200 million and will be entirely funded from the proceeds of the 2016 borrowings. DEBT STRUCTURE/BURDEN Including the net new money debt from the 2016 borrowings, Carle's pro forma long-term debt will total approximately $715 million. Following these transactions, Carle will have approximately 61% of fixed-rate debt and 39% variable rate debt. Of the variable-rate debt, approximately $160 million is letter of credit (LOC) supported and the remaining is bank loans. Expiration dates on the LOC's and bank loans range from 2019 to 2024, with no more than two expiring on any one date. Carle has four swaps in place - two fixed payor swaps and two basis swaps. Total notional value of the swaps is $192 million. There are four counterparties, which provides for good counterparty diversity as it limits exposure to any single counterparty. The collateral thresholds on the swaps range from $15 million to $20 million and Carle has never had to post collateral. The mark-to-market on the swaps is negative $22.1 million at June 30, 2016. Pro forma leverage metrics have moderated over the historical period and are manageable at the current rating level. Following the 2016 transactions, MADS will increase from $38 million to $43 million. In the six-month interim, pro forma MADS coverage was a solid 4.1x. DISCLOSURE Carle covenants to disclose annual financial information within 150 days of each fiscal year-end and quarterly information within 50 days of each fiscal quarter-end to EMMA. Disclosure to date has been excellent and includes both consolidated and consolidating balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flows, as well as management discussion and analysis.

(Photo: AP) Wells Fargo (WFC), reeling from a widespread scandal that attracted ire from lawmakers and cost its CEO his job, will face a barrage of questions again Friday as it reports quarterly profit results. JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (C) are also reporting third-quarter earnings Friday. But bank stock investors will be paying particular attention to Wells Fargo as the company elaborates on Chairman and CEO John Stumpf's sudden departure Wednesday and the extent of the losses from and plans to address the “cross-selling” scandal that has rocked the San Francisco-based company. Its employees allegedly created upwards of 2 million phony accounts without customers' consent, triggering federal investigations, congressional inquiries and lost business. The large banks’ financial statements and executives’ conference calls also will be parsed for the effects of lingering global challenges — such as Brexit, the sluggish European economy, Deutsche Bank’s recent woes and the rising Libor interest rate — that cloud otherwise resilient domestic economic conditions. The overall picture will undoubtedly be part of the calculation used by Federal Reserve policy makers looking to possibly raise interest rates in December for the first time this year. "During the third quarter, banks faced another challenging operating environment, with uncertainty and volatility arising after the Brexit vote and lackluster global economic growth continued," Brian Kleinhanzl, an industry analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, wrote in a recent note to investors. Parsing Wells Fargo Stumpf's surprising departure — he had insisted on staying even after some critics, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, called for his resignation — thickens the plot for Wells Fargo investors, who will want to hear reassuring words and concrete strategy from Stumpf's immediate replacement, COO Timothy Sloan. To manage expectations, Stumpf and Sloan held an hour-long call with about 500 senior executives Monday, The Wall Street Journal reported. Sloan, who was named CEO and elected to the board Wednesday, will now field questions from Wall Street largely on his own. During the internal conference call, Wells Fargo executives were assured that efforts by some states to suspend some business with the bank “weren’t having much effect,” the WSJ reported. The bank is still reporting growth in new checking accounts even as the growth rate slowed, Sloan is reported to have said. "To say the last month has been difficult is an understatement," Sloan said. “It’s going to be harder for a while, and we get that.” In a recent KBW podcast, Kleinhanzl said he estimates the bank could lose about $400 million in both 2017 and 2018 “due to friction” stemming from the scandal. Wells Fargo's earnings per share for the third quarter are estimated to have fallen 4% to $1.01, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. USA TODAY Chicago cuts off Wells Fargo for a year Slowing loan growth Low interest rates have helped fuel the mortgage market, one of the brighter spots for the bank sector. But bank revenues also have been pressured by the narrow spread in the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The banks still managed to eke out a 1.4% year-over-year earnings growth in the second quarter, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Consumer loans and other businesses compensated for the narrow interest rates spread. But sluggish demand for commercial and industrial loans remains a concern for analysts as banks want to make up for the interest income squeeze with greater loan volume. Commercial and industrial loans were flat in the third quarter compared with the previous quarter, according to data from the Federal Reserve last week. A slow commercial loan growth rate in the third quarter is due largely to “seasonal softness” in auto dealership business, tepid manufacturing activity in summer months, weak corporate acquisition activity and the energy’s industry ongoing troubles, Brian Klock, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said in a podcast. Brexit concerns could also be keeping some companies from borrowing as they keep their plans on hold while Britain considers details of its exit from the European Union. USA TODAY Is Deutsche Bank the next Lehman moment? Global investors are also spooked by Deutsche Bank’s woes, with some even comparing it to the early dramas of Lehman Bros., a large U.S. brokerage firm that crumbled in 2008 and set off the financial crisis. The German behemoth saw its investment banking business plummet this year and its market value cut about half as it faces a multibillion-dollar fine from U.S. regulators for its role in the events that led to the 2008 financial crisis. It’s also accused of manipulating the Libor in 2012. “What happens in Europe doesn’t stay in Europe,” Kleinhanzl said.

Roz Edward, Michigan Chronicle Managing Editor Leave a comment The Great Lakes Women’s Business Council is pleased to announce it has received a $320,000 grant from JPMorgan Chase. These funds will support the Detroit Business Growth Initiative, an innovative program to grow existing certified businesses in Detroit-specifically advanced certifications for minority women and veteran-certified businesses. The grant is part of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s $100 million, five-year commitment to Detroit’s economic recovery. Launched in 2014, the investment in Detroit focuses on community development, blight mitigation, job skills training, small business promotion and other economic growth initiatives. The Detroit Business Growth Initiative addresses the priority of accelerating small business growth. There are approximately 32,000 minority-owned small businesses in Detroit, according to the U.S. Census, which makes Detroit the fourth largest U.S. city for the number of minority-owned businesses. Small businesses require three elements to be sustainable: capital, capacity and customers. There are several organizations in Detroit addressing capital and capacity. What has not been a focus is connecting small businesses to contract opportunities through major corporations and government entities. “Small businesses are the backbone of our economy in Detroit and, together, we can do more to not only improve their chance to succeed but also reduce unemployment in the city and expand opportunity for all,” says Tosha Tabron, Relationship Manager for Global Philanthropy at JPMorgan Chase & Co. “By investing in this program, we are improving access to customers and that’s the best way to help them grow their businesses.” The program, which is expected to create 25 new jobs, leverage $500,000 in financing and increase sales by 35% on average, will provide expert led training and coaching to connect existing Detroit-based businesses to contract opportunities in the corporate and government arenas. Participants will have access to our 20+ years’ experience in procurement and certification along with 30+ years of relationships and small business loan programs. The Detroit Business Growth Initiative will feature a series of trainings, individual counseling and coaching streamlined to help participants fully utilize certifications, capital and contract opportunities. “Detroit small businesses deserve the best we have to give.  We are providing all of our business growth skills and experience as well as our relationships with 100+ corporations interested in doing business with certified business owners.  These Detroit businesses will accelerate their growth”, says Michelle Richards, Great Lakes WBC Executive Director.

Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo are all expected to report earnings before the market open on Friday. Trader David Seaburg said that the quarterly results from the banks actually don't matter as much as a looming rate hike from the Federal Reserve. He said, if anything, the expectations for the sector are very low right now. Seaburg said he would rather hold onto the bank stocks right now and then take off profits when the Fed raises its benchmark federal funds rate. Trader Pete Najarian agreed and said he is holding positions in Bank of America and Goldman Sachs. He also said that JPMorgan Chase has been a very resilient stock in the banking sector. Trader Dan Nathan said he's not certain the risk-reward "is really there" in the financials.

(AP) BILL PETERS 10/12/2016 Reprints With JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) set to report third-quarter earnings on Friday, the landscape for the big banks has enough in common with what we saw in Q2. In other words, the Fed still opted not to raise interest rates, hurting the banks' net interest margins. The state of the U.S. consumer remained generally solid. And the global "economic uncertainty?" That was still there too. "During the third quarter, banks faced another challenging operating environment, with uncertainty and volatility arising after the Brexit vote and lackluster global economic growth continued," Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a research note. The only good news some analysts see is no bad news. "Unfortunately, the positive might come in just not having any negatives," Edward Jones analyst Shannon Stemm said. But Citigroup last month cited better trading in Q3 but weaker-than-anticipated investment banking, while JPMorgan remained upbeat on the economy and the state of the consumer. Other factors will be likely to dominate the financial world's attention. Many observers will likely be cued into any commentary surrounding Wells Fargo's cross-selling scandal — in which authorities said the bank's employees created as many as 2 million unauthorized consumer accounts to hit sales targets. The scandal has cost John Stumpf his job as CEO and chairman. The bank said late Wednesday COO Tim Sloan is taking over as CEO and Stephen Sanger is taking over as chair. The Wall Street Journal reported that the bank outlined plans to rebound from the scandal during a conference call on Monday. Details from those plans could be presented on Friday. The scandal over the bank's cross-selling, a point of pride for management only a few years ago, led to some intense questioning from Congress about the bank's culture and executives' knowledge of the sales practices. The financial impact during Q3, however, was limited. Wall Street expects Wells Fargo's earnings per share to fall 4% to $1.01. Revenue is seen rising 1.5% to $22.2 billion. "The investment community's going to be looking for some specifics from the management team on what they're going to do to adjust sales practices, and what's that going to look like from a cost standpoint?" Stemm said. "And then I think there will be follow-ons to some of the other banks, too – 'What do your sales practices look like? What are you doing to monitor both risky behavior?' What does that look like for future compliance costs?" Beyond cross-selling, KBW expects Wells' net interest margins to be constrained, even after the bank grew loans considerably in quarters past. JPMorgan, another bank KBW said was dependent on loan growth after activity rose rapidly in recent quarters, is expected to report EPS down 17% to $1.39. The bank's equity markets could be a bright spot, KBW said. Revenue is expected to climb 2% to $23.988 billion. Citigroup's EPS, meanwhile, is expected to fall 15% to $1.15, with revenue down 6% to $17.344. Citigroup in June also acquired Costco's (COST) U.S. co-brand credit-card portfolio from American Express (AXP). Citi and Costco announced their co-branded credit-card deal last March. "(Q3) will be the first full quarter with Costco in the numbers and management has already indicated that the performance within the Costco portfolio is exceeding management's expectations," Kleinhanzl wrote. "If Citi can show material growth in receivables from the Costco portfolio then we would expect shares of Citigroup to do well at earnings." KBW also said Citigroup may have gotten more of a bump from fixed income, currencies and commodities trading. But the bank has said that investment banking during the quarter was "lighter than estimated." JPMorgan dipped 0.3% in the stock market today, while Citigroup lost 0.6% and Wells Fargo eased 0.3%. Bank of America (BAC) fell 0.5%. Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 0.8%, while Goldman Sachs (GS) added 0.15%. IBD'S TAKE: While U.S. banking giants face tighter restrictions from regulators, their stronger capital positions have helped them take market share from European rivals, who have yet to fully recover from the financial crisis. Bank stocks have rallied in recent weeks as the Fed has shown more openness to raising interest rates. Other factors could extend their gains, Morgan Stanley notes. That uptrend for the banks "could continue if oil prices edge higher, inflation picks up, Yellen raises rates, corporates re-engage," Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck wrote in a research note. "Risks include a divided government post-election, weak C&I growth, and political backlash." Other risks for the banks include commercial lending, which KBW expects to weaken after the U.K.'s vote in June to leave the European Union caused businesses to put plans on hold, which in turn meant less borrowing. Bank of America reports Monday, Goldman reports next Tuesday, and Morgan Stanley reports on Wednesday. IBD's money center banking industry group, where most of the major banks are, was ranked 131st out of 197 groups on Tuesday. It has been in the bottom half of the table for many months.

"As we've seen the stabilization in commodity markets, as we've seen stabilization in the dollar, I think that sets you up for a much more productive outlook for both emerging market growth and for emerging market earnings," Parker told CNBC's "Squawk Box" on Tuesday.

"If you want to lower savings and boost growth, you actually raise interest rates a little bit," said Matus, deputy chief United States economist at UBS. Matus also told CNBC that low, stagnant growth does not necessarily indicate an oncoming recession. He said one of most frequent questions he gets from clients is where in the economic cycle is the U.S. economy and how close the country is to a recession. Matus' take: "We've got low growth but it's very stable growth, and so we are nowhere close to a recession at this point."

The release of quarterly results from Alcoa is seen as the unofficial start of earnings season, with financial giants Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) due to report their results later this week. Overall trading activity may be somewhat subdued, however, as some traders may stay on the sidelines amid a lack of major U.S. economic data. The minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting and reports on retail sales and producer prices are likely to attract attention in the coming days. U.S. stocks closed Monday's session higher amid a rally in crude oil prices. The major averages opened higher and moved roughly sideways until early afternoon trading. After giving back some of their gains over the remainder of the session, the averages ended moderately higher. The Dow Industrials added 88.55 points or 0.49 percent before ending at 18,329, the S&P 500 Index ended up 9.92 points or 0.46 percent at 2,164 and the Nasdaq Composite closed at 5,329, up 36.27 points or 0.69 percent. Eighteen of the thirty Dow components ended the session higher and four stocks were little changed, while the remaining eight stocks retreated. Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), Boeing (BA), Merck (MRK) and Apple (AAPL) were among the biggest gainers of the session, but Procter & Gamble (PG) and Wal-Mart (WMT) fell sharply. Among the sectors, energy, banking, airline and telecom stocks turned in some of the best performances on the day. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures for November delivery are slipping $0.34 to $51.01 a barrel after ending Monday's session up $1.54 at $51.35 a barrel, the highest closing level since July 15th, 2015. Meanwhile, an ounce of gold is currently trading at $1,258, down $2.40 from the previous session's close of $1,260.40. On Monday, gold rose $8.90, snapping a 6-session losing streak. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 103.64 yen compared to the 103.61 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Monday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1090 compared to yesterday's $1.1139. Asia The Asian markets closed mixed, with the Singapore, South Korean, Taiwanese and Hong Kong markets declining, while the rest of the markets advanced. The Indian market was closed for a public holiday. The Japanese market, which opened after Monday's public holiday, advanced as the yen remained weak. The Nikkei 225 Index opened higher and rose steadily in the morning. Although there was a slight loss of momentum by the mid-session, the index consolidated in the afternoon, closing up 164.67 points or 0.98 percent at a more than 1-month high of 17,025. Food, chemical, pharma, export, utility, telecom and most resource stocks gained ground, while some housing, real estate, steel, financial and retail stocks came under selling pressure. Australia's All Ordinaries Index ended modestly higher, although well off its best levels. The index ended at 5,562, up 6.70 points or 0.12 percent. Energy and material stocks rallied strongly and consumer and utility stocks saw moderate strength, but most other sectors lost ground. China's Shanghai Composite Index closed 17.11 points or 0.56 percent higher at 3,065, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surrendered all its morning gains by early afternoon trading and languished below the unchanged line thereafter. The index ended down 302.30 points or 1.27 percent at 23,550. On the economic front, the results of a survey by National Australia Bank showed that confidence among businesses in Australia was unchanged in September. The corresponding index was static at 6, although above the expected reading of 5. The business conditions index rose 1 point to 8. A report released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that the total number of home loans issued in Australia fell 3 percent month-over-month in August. This was steeper than the 1.5 percent drop expected by economists. This follows a 4.5 percent drop in July. Investment lending edged up 0.1 percent. Data released by the Ministry of Finance showed that Japan's current account surplus came in at 2.0 trillion yen in August, more than the 1.5 trillion yen expected by economists and the 1.94 trillion-yen surplus in July. The trade surplus was also wider than expected at 243.2 billion yen, as exports fell 9.6 percent and imports declined a steeper 18.3 percent. Europe European stocks are holding up despite a volatile morning session. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has inched up by 0.1 percent, the French CAC 40 Index and the German DAX Index are both up by 0.2 percent. On the economic front, German investor sentiment climbed at a faster-than-expected pace in October to its highest level in four months, the results of a survey by the Centre for European Economic Research/ZEW showed. The ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment rose to 6.2 from 0.5 in each of the previous two months. Economists had expected a score of 4. The latest reading was the strongest since June's 19.2. Data released by the British Retail Consortium showed that like-for-like sales in the U.K. rose 0.4 percent year-over-year in September, belying expectations for a 0.3 percent drop. U.S. Economic Reports There are no market moving economic reports due for the day. Stocks in Focus Shares of Alcoa are moving lower in pre-market trading after the aluminum giant reported third quarter earnings and revenues that came in below analyst estimates. Rent-A-Center- (RCII) may also come under pressure after warning of much weaker than expected third quarter earnings. Illumina (ILMN) pre-announced third quarter revenues of about $607 million, a 10 percent increase year-over-year but below the company's guidance of $625 million to $630 million. The company attributed the shortfall to a larger than expected decline in high throughput sequencing instruments.

M&T still top bank in share By ANNE SAUNDERS • October 7, 2016 Canandaigua National Bank continues to build local market share, this year jumping past JPMorgan Chase & Co. to take the second spot behind M&T Bank Corp. M&T Bank Corp. held onto its top spot in the latest listing of market share for the Rochester metropolitan statistical area, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., but this year its deposits of $4 billion and market share of 24 percent showed no sign of growth compared with 2015. Market share and total deposits for all the banks were measured as of June 30. “The FDIC report is a one-day snapshot, and it reflects all deposits at an institution,” noted Daniel Burns, president of M&T’s Rochester division, adding “there’s a lot of noise inside these numbers.” “That being said, we don’t manage to the FDIC report, or any other report. We focus on understanding what’s important to our customers and communities and serving our customer needs every day. If you look beyond deposits, which is just one aspect of the business, our lending to local small businesses has increased significantly this year,” Burns said. JPMorgan Chase, which was second in market share, fell to third, dropping from 13.3 percent a year ago to 11.1 percent this year with local deposits that fell from $2.2 billion to $1.86 billion. The bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile Canandaigua National Bank and Trust Co. continued to make gradual inroads, growing its market share from 11.1 percent a year ago to 11.7 percent this year and deposits from $1.8 billion in 2015 to $1.95 billion. President and CEO Frank Hamlin said there is no overriding explanation beyond the steady and solid work of a lot of great employees at CNB. “We really are the bank of the community, and the community is coming to bank with us, and that’s reflected in the numbers,” said Lawrence Heilbronner, executive vice president and chief financial officer. Citizens Financial Group Inc.’s Citizens Bank N.A. was No. 4 with a 9.4 percent market share and local deposits of $1.6 billion, roughly the same as last year. The 2016 data do not reflect the merger of First Niagara Financial Group Inc.’s First Niagara Bank and KeyCorp’s KeyBank. First Niagara is No. 5 on the list with 8.7 percent of market share and deposits in this market of $1.46 billion, up from 8.4 percent in 2015 and $1.4 billion. KeyBank, No. 6, also grew its local market share from 6.5 percent in 2015 to 6.8 percent this year and $1.14 billion in deposits in 2016, compared with $1.1 billion in 2015. If the merged banks hang onto their combined deposits, KeyBank would appear next year in the second slot, assuming nothing major changes for the other banks on the list. The rest of the top 10 are:  Financial Institutions Inc.’s Five Star Bank at No. 7 with 5.9 percent—up from 5.8 percent in 2015—and $994 million in deposits locally;  Bank of America N.A. at No. 8 with 5.1 percent—up from 4.7 percent in 2015—and $848 million;  Lyons National Bank at No. 9 with 4.5 percent—up from nearly 4 percent in 2015—and $758 million; and  Community Bank N.A. at No. 10 with 3.85 percent—up from 3.8 percent with an increase in deposits from $627 million to $645 million.

Opinion Oct 13 2016 at 9:20 AM Updated Oct 13 2016 at 9:20 AM Save article Print Higher deposit rate could bolster Wells Fargo Share Share via Email Share on Google Plus Post on facebook wall Share on twitter Post to Linkedin Share on Reddit There is one lever the bank could consider pulling to help keep mom and pop from jumping ship: interest rates on savings and checking accounts and certificates of deposits. Paul Sakuma by Michael P. Regan Among the steady drumbeat of negative news for Wells Fargo in the wake of its fake-account scandal, the most troubling headlines may be those telling of lost business because of the bank's shredded reputation. Illinois, California, Seattle and Chicago are among those that have all announced recently that they were refraining from working with the bank. This lost business, mostly in municipal-bond underwriting, shouldn't be enough to move the needle much on Wells Fargo's bottom line. The bulk of its business is centred on the banking needs of retail mom-and-pop customers - and those clients don't issue press releases or write open letters to announce that they're turning their backs on the bank. So a question that will linger, perhaps even beyond the bank's latest earnings release this week, is how many of these customers will decide to flee. One hint may be in how often the bank's mobile application is downloaded. The app's rank in iOS and Google Play stores has taken a noticeable hit, sending the gap between it and apps from Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase to the widest level since 2014, according to analysts at UBS. That is obviously an imperfect measure of consumer behaviour, as the analysts pointed out, but it certainly hints at a slowdown in new accounts and engagement among customers. Wells Fargo has increased deposits briskly in recent years, so it would require a full-scale mutiny for the situation to become acute. However, should an exodus of retail customers become problematic, there is one lever the bank could consider pulling to help keep mom and pop from jumping ship: interest rates on savings and checking accounts and certificates of deposits. The effect of higher benchmark interest rates - like the fed funds rate or more variable rates like Libor - on the rates paid to savers is known as deposit beta. The conventional wisdom has been that deposit betas would be minuscule - almost nonexistent - during the initial few interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve. That would allow banks to benefit from, say, the first 50 basis points of rate increases as they pass along higher borrowing costs to customers but not much of the gain to depositors. That seems to have been the case when looking at certificate of deposit rates after the 25 basis point increase last year: That proved to be a wise move for banks because yield curves flattened during the year after the first rate increase, pressuring net interest margins. Now the Fed seems to be telegraphing that the next 25 basis point increase will come at the end of this year, and yield curves are steepening again. What if, instead of hoarding most of the benefits of higher rates, Wells Fargo were to more aggressively pass the increase along to customers? It would not take too much to make the rates on certificates of deposit stand out among the bank's largest competitors: Rates paid on certificates of deposits have languished near record lows. Bloomberg As you can see from the chart above, Wells Fargo offers a "bonus" rate on CDs. How does one qualify for this "bonus" from the bank? Cross-selling, of course! The rate is paid to customers who maintain a "linked PMA Package", incentives to persuade customers to open other accounts and link them to a Wells Fargo checking account. CDs are only a fraction of Wells Fargo's deposits. Checking accounts, which pay practically nothing in interest, and savings accounts, which pay about 8 or 10 basis points, are a bigger deal, and an increase in their rates might be even more soothing to miffed customers. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf has said in the past that he dreams at night about checking accounts, and the first thing he looks at when he gets to work at 5.30am is the bank's deposits. The reason for those dreams? Primary checking accounts are about three times as profitable as secondary accounts, he has said. He's also said the bank's deposits should remain "sticky" even if higher interest rates cause customers to start shopping around. It makes you wonder whether Stumpf still dreams about checking accounts and whether those dreams are as pleasant as they once were. And it makes you wonder what those 5.30am deposit checks are like these days. Are those deposits as sticky as they once were? Or could they use a little more glue - in the form of higher interest rates? Related Quotes 5 years 1 Day Last updated: Updating... Last updated: Updating...

Mr. Stumpf, 63, is retiring from both posts effective immediately, the bank said Wednesday in a statement. Tim Sloan, 56, the company's president and chief operating officer, will succeed him as CEO. Lead director Stephen Sanger will serve as the board's non-executive chairman. “John Stumpf has dedicated his professional life to banking, successfully leading Wells Fargo through the financial crisis and the largest merger in banking history, and helping to create one of the strongest and most well-known financial services companies in the world,” Mr. Sanger said in the statement. “However, he believes new leadership at this time is appropriate to guide Wells Fargo through its current challenges.” Mr. Stumpf leaves Wells Fargo and its 268,000 employees with a damaged reputation. It has refunded $2.6 million to affected customers and has said it's ending the sales incentives that have been blamed for the abuses. The bank's stock fell as much as 12% after the misdeeds became public, and its subsequent rebound has not been enough for Wells Fargo to retake the top spot in market value among U.S. banks, which it relinquished to JPMorgan Chase & Co. It's an ignominious end to a nine-year tenure as CEO that saw Wells Fargo grow to become the biggest U.S. home lender with returns that were the envy of other bank executives. The profits were driven in part by cross-selling — offering credit cards to customers who opened checking accounts, for example — the strategy that's at the center of the scandal that brought Mr. Stumpf down. Mr. Stump's unraveling began on Sept. 8, when the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that Wells Fargo had agreed to pay $185 million to settle allegations it secretly opened the unauthorized accounts. Multimillion-dollar settlements have become almost routine in the banking industry, but the brazenness and breadth of the misconduct struck a nerve. The U.S. Senate called a hearing, and two weeks later Mr. Stumpf traveled to Washington for an almost three-hour grilling. “I am deeply sorry that we've failed to fulfill on our responsibility to our customers, to our team members and to the American public,” he told the Senate Banking Committee. “I've been through many challenges at Wells Fargo, but none of which pains me more than the one we will discuss this morning.” Senators took turns berating him. Senator Elizabeth Warren accused him of “gutless leadership” for blaming junior employees. “You should resign,” the Massachusetts Democrat told Mr. Stumpf. “You should give back the money that you took while this scam was going on and you should be criminally investigated by both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.” A week after the hearing, Mr. Stumpf agreed to forgo $41 million in unvested stock that had been granted for performance, as well as some of his salary. That wasn't enough for Congress. At a second hearing on Sept. 29, called by the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Stumpf denied there was any organized effort to open unauthorized accounts. Lawmakers suggested the bank should be broken up and called for his arrest. Wells Fargo “is a criminal enterprise,” said Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat. “Would you allow someone to walk out after robbing your bank?” The San Francisco-based bank said it had fired 5,300 employees over the fake accounts. Some low-level bankers came forward, saying they were under intense pressure to meet sales quotas. They said managers told them to do whatever it took to open new accounts, even if customers didn't ask for them. At Sen. Warren's insistence, the Department of Labor agreed on Sept. 26 to conduct a review of whether the bank violated wage and overtime rules while pushing branch workers to meet aggressive targets. U.S. prosecutors are also investigating, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. “What you saw from the two hearings was that he came across as really out of touch, not just with what was going on in the bank, but also with the current political environment,” said Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. “It was a certain aloofness that he presented, which is not what you wanted to see in that situation. Overall, he completely misread the situation.” 0 Comments What do you think?

Stumpf's Exit Caps Sudden Fall of Once-Touted Wells Fargo Brand By Kristin Broughton and Dean Anason October 12, 2016 Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Google + Email 3 Comments Print Reprints Out: The departure of Stumpf highlights the change of fortune at Wells Fargo, which until recently was regarded as a marquee brand and the least problematic of the megabanks. IMAGE: Bloomberg News Related Wells Scandal Renews Calls to Split Up CEO and Chairman Roles How Wells Fargo Mishandled a Reputational Crisis After Brutal Hearing, What's Next for Wells Fargo? Picking the Brain of Wells Fargo's (Likely) Next CEO 'That's Just Really, Really Bad': Bank CEOs React to Wells Scandal Why Media Representation Matters for Women in Banking Eight Commercial Mortgages Where Borrowers Cashed Out Handsomely The Wells Fargo phony-accounts scandal is barely five weeks old, but it felt like John Stumpf had been hanging on for five years. The ax finally fell Wednesday, when the company put out a news release after the markets had closed saying that Stumpf had retired as chairman and chief executive effective immediately. His exit marks the rare case of a major U.S. bank CEO stepping aside amid accusations of company misconduct. It also caps a remarkable change in fortune for a bank that, following the financial crisis, was regarded as a marquee brand. Perhaps there had been worse scandals in recent memory, or ones costlier to the bottom line like JPMorgan's London Whale controversy, but few were as understandable to the general public as the Wells fiasco. The fact that it had occurred in the homestretch of a highly polarized presidential election made Stumpf even more of a target. In the end he had to step aside amid mounting anger from investors and policymakers over the creation of fraudulent customer accounts. Stumpf, 63, has left his post after nearly a decade as CEO. He will be succeeded by Tim Sloan, 56, who currently serves as president and chief operating officer. Sloan keeps the title of president and has joined the board of directors, too. The new chairman is Stephen Sanger, who had been lead director. Independent director Elizabeth Duke, a former Federal Reserve Board governor, has been elevated to serve as vice chair. Sloan's tough challenge will be to try to repair the tattered image of Wells Fargo. "It's a great privilege to have the opportunity to lead one of America's most storied companies at a critical juncture in its history," Sloan was quoted as saying in the release. "My immediate and highest priority is to restore trust in Wells Fargo. It's a tremendous responsibility, one which I look forward to taking on." Calls for Stumpf's resignation had escalated in recent weeks after the San Francisco company said on Sept. 8 it would pay nearly $190 million to settle charges that employees created roughly 2 million fake accounts to meet sales goals and collect bonuses. More than 5,300 employees across the country were fired between 2011 and 2014 for creating the unlawful accounts. Shortly after the settlement was disclosed, Wells Fargo said it would eliminate incentive packages that reward branch employees for cross-selling and hitting sales targets. Still, Wells has struggled to contain the fallout from the cross-selling scandal — and, in the meantime, the company's once-sterling reputation has taken a significant hit. Adding to the furor was a disastrous appearance by Stumpf in front of the Senate Banking Committee on Sept. 20. During his testimony, Stumpf fumbled basic questions such as when exactly the company uncovered the pervasive fraud. Stumpf also provided confusing answers about whether senior executives have been held responsible for the scandal — and if they would be subject to clawbacks in pay. Eventually, Wells clawed back $41 million of Stumpf's pay and $19 million of unvested stock awards from former retail banking head Carrie Tolstedt. But those punishments weren't enough to satisfy the bank's many critics. "While I have been deeply committed and focused on managing the company through this period, I have decided it is best for the company that I step aside," Stumpf was quoted as saying in the release. Stumpf was named CEO of Wells Fargo in June 2007, succeeding longtime executive Richard Kovacevich. Stumpf added the title of chairman nearly three years later, in January 2010. In his first few months on the job, Stumpf oversaw one of the biggest deals in banking history, when Wells Fargo agreed in late 2008 to buy the $510 billion-asset Wachovia, which was on the brink of collapse. Stumpf spent more than three decades at Wells Fargo and its predecessor companies. He joined Minneapolis-based Norwest Corp. in 1982 and quickly worked his way up the ranks. When Wells Fargo merged with Norwest in 1998, Stumpf took over as head of banking operations in the Southwest. In 2002, Stumpf was named executive vice president and head of community banking. He was promoted to the roles of president and chief operating officer three years later. In the lead-up to the announcement Wednesday, Sloan was widely viewed as the heir apparent. Still, some analysts had called on Wells to consider external candidates, arguing that an outsider was necessary to change company culture. Sloan has been with Wells Fargo for 29 years. He was named president and chief operating officer in November 2015. "The board of directors has great confidence in Tim Sloan," the new chairman, Sanger, said in the release. "He is a proven leader who knows Wells Fargo's operations deeply, holds the respect of its stakeholders, and is ready to lead the company into the future."

Posted by dm1974 | Thursday, October 13 2016 at 1:30PM ET I'm pretty sure that WF has a system in place that allows for and encourages its employees to be involved and volunteer in the community and do it on company time. I've see commercials to that effect and have see WF employees wearing (in this case) red volunteering shirts. Not sure what your point is? Posted by Common Sense | Thursday, October 13 2016 at 11:59AM ET Please try volunteering as an incentive Mr. Sloan. Wells Fargo should consider a new way of encouraging employees while helping the community. Volunteerism on company time would be a miracle for any community based 501c3. Only 2% of Wells Fargos work force volunteering 1 day a month would equal 1,000,000 volunteer hours yearly. The volunteer infrastructure is in place, Wells Fargo just needs to tap into the system. Wells Fargo employees could benefit from non-monetary incentives like a regional yearly retreat for volunteers. There are so many ways Wells Fargo employees could volunteer, churches, boys and girls clubs, public recreation programs, volunteer to work alongside participants of a court ordered labor program, elder care, and so much more. Wells Fargo should still get the tax break for labor cost if volunteering happens during work hours. Its a win win and not much productivity lost if the volunteers plan ahead.

Embattled CEO Stumpf is out effective immediately, with President and Chief Operating Officer Tim Sloan taking over as the head of the one of the nation’s largest banks. (AP file photo) Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf quits in fallout from fake accounts By: Bloomberg News October 12, 2016 4:42 pm 0 John Stumpf, who led Wells Fargo & Co. through the financial crisis and built it into the world’s most valuable bank, stepped down as chief executive officer and chairman, bowing to public outcry over legions of accounts opened by his employees for customers who didn’t request them. Stumpf, 63, is retiring from both posts effective immediately, the bank said Wednesday in a statement. Tim Sloan, 56, the company’s president and chief operating officer, will succeed him as CEO. Lead director Stephen Sanger will serve as the board’s non-executive chairman. “John Stumpf has dedicated his professional life to banking, successfully leading Wells Fargo through the financial crisis and the largest merger in banking history, and helping to create one of the strongest and most well-known financial services companies in the world,” Sanger said in the statement. “However, he believes new leadership at this time is appropriate to guide Wells Fargo through its current challenges.” Stumpf leaves Wells Fargo and its 268,000 employees with a damaged reputation. It has refunded $2.6 million to affected customers and has said it’s ending the sales incentives that have been blamed for the abuses. The bank’s stock fell as much as 12 percent after the misdeeds became public, and its subsequent rebound has not been enough for Wells Fargo to retake the top spot in market value among U.S. banks, which it relinquished to JPMorgan Chase & Co. Wells Fargo shares climbed 1.5 percent to $46 in extended trading at 5:11 p.m. in New York, after the bank announced Stumpf’s exit. The stock had slumped 17 percent this year through the close of regular trading, the worst performance in the 24-company KBW Bank Index. It’s an ignominious end to a nine-year tenure as CEO that saw Wells Fargo grow to become the biggest U.S. home lender with returns that were the envy of other bank executives. The profits were driven in part by cross-selling — offering credit cards to customers who opened checking accounts, for example — the strategy that’s at the center of the scandal that brought Stumpf down. For more on Wells Fargo’s new CEO Tim Sloan, click here Stump’s unraveling began on Sept. 8, when the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that Wells Fargo had agreed to pay $185 million to settle allegations it secretly opened the unauthorized accounts. Multimillion-dollar settlements have become almost routine in the banking industry, but the brazenness and breadth of the misconduct struck a nerve. The U.S. Senate called a hearing, and two weeks later Stumpf traveled to Washington for an almost three-hour grilling. “I am deeply sorry that we’ve failed to fulfill on our responsibility to our customers, to our team members and to the American public,” Stumpf told the Senate Banking Committee. “I’ve been through many challenges at Wells Fargo, but none of which pains me more than the one we will discuss this morning.” Senators took turns berating him. Senator Elizabeth Warren accused him of “gutless leadership” for blaming junior employees. “You should resign,” the Massachusetts Democrat told Stumpf. “You should give back the money that you took while this scam was going on and you should be criminally investigated by both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.” Unvested Stock A week after the hearing, Stumpf agreed to forgo $41 million in unvested stock that had been granted for performance, as well as some of his salary. That wasn’t enough for Congress. At a second hearing on Sept. 29, called by the House Financial Services Committee, Stumpf denied there was any organized effort to open unauthorized accounts. Lawmakers suggested the bank should be broken up and called for his arrest. Wells Fargo “is a criminal enterprise,” said Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat. “Would you allow someone to walk out after robbing your bank?” Fired Employees The San Francisco-based bank said it had fired 5,300 employees over the fake accounts. Some low-level bankers came forward, saying they were under intense pressure to meet sales quotas. They said managers told them to do whatever it took to open new accounts, even if customers didn’t ask for them. At Warren’s insistence, the Department of Labor agreed on Sept. 26 to conduct a review of whether the bank violated wage and overtime rules while pushing branch workers to meet aggressive targets. U.S. prosecutors are also investigating, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. “What you saw from the two hearings was that he came across as really out of touch, not just with what was going on in the bank, but also with the current political environment,” said Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. “It was a certain aloofness that he presented, which is not what you wanted to see in that situation. Overall, he completely misread the situation.” Minnesota Dairy Stumpf, one of 11 children of a dairy farmer from Pierz, Minnesota, about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Minneapolis, joined the loan department of Norwest Corp. in 1982 and rose through the banks. In 1998, Norwest merged with Wells Fargo and Stumpf was put in charge of Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. He was appointed president in 2005. When Stumpf assumed the top job in June 2007, the U.S. housing bubble was about to pop. A year later, amid the ensuing financial crisis, he outmaneuvered Citigroup Inc. to purchase Wachovia Corp. American Banker chose Stumpf as its 2013 Banker of the Year, and Morningstar Inc. named him its CEO of the Year for 2015. Aside from settlements with cities such as Baltimore and Memphis for predatory mortgage lending in which it neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, Wells Fargo generally avoided controversies that ensnared some of its competitors. While Stumpf lacks the presentation skills of some other CEOs, he deserves credit for managing the integration of Wachovia, said Gary Townsend, founder of family office GBT Capital Management in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Other CEOs Other Wall Street CEOs have survived more costly misdeeds. Lloyd Blankfein of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was excoriated at a 10-hour Senate hearing in 2010 over the bank’s aggressive marketing of mortgage investments and paid a then-record $550 million fine. JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon faced a congressional committee’s displeasure over the London Whale trading debacle, which ended up costing more than $1 billion in fines. Even J.P. Morgan Jr. was dragged before Congress in 1933 to take blame for the Great Depression. None lost their jobs. “There is not a single American with a bank account who hasn’t had complications, errant fees or frustration,” said Isaac Boltansky, an analyst at Compass Point Research & Trading LLC in Washington. “That’s what makes this account scandal so insidious and relatable.” Folksy Persona Wells Fargo has paid Stumpf more than $250 million since 2000, when the bank first began disclosing his compensation. That figure includes $23 million in salary, $44 million in cash bonuses, and $190 million from the vesting of stock and exercising of stock options. As CEO, Stumpf cultivated a folksy persona, regaling interviewers with descriptions of his hardscrabble upbringing. He pushed cross-selling, using slogans including “Eight is Great” to encourage bankers to sell eight different products to each customer. Ironically, the fake accounts weren’t profitable for Wells Fargo, according to Mike Mayo, an analyst at CLSA Ltd. in New York. Stumpf was two years away from Wells Fargo’s mandatory retirement age of 65.

There are just a few earnings reports Thursday with Delta Air Lines, First Republic Bank, Winnebago, Marriott Vacations and Unilever in the morning. But Friday brings on the releases from major banks — Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, and financial stocks have been rising ahead of those results. Earnings season gets into full swing next week when dozens of S&P 500 companies report. "Earnings are especially important now because of the valuations in the market. Earnings are crucial. You can only go so long without growth," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. She said the market will also continue to watch the election, since it has begun to react negatively to any signs that Democrats could win over Congress. A feud between Republican Donald Trump and other Republicans triggered talk that if Clinton were to win big, the Democrats could take back the House. That raises concerns that Congress would have a consensus to enact more market-unfriendly regulations and fewer market-friendly spending and tax policies. "The election is filtering into the market, and you're seeing it more and more," she said. The broader market indexes meandered Wednesday and had little reaction after the Fed minutes release at 2 p.m. The S&P 500 closed up less than 3 points at 2,139.18. The best-performing sectors were real estate and utilities, ironically high-yielding groups that benefit from lower interest rates. Treasury yields slipped slightly after the minutes. The 10-year was at 1.77 percent, after trading as high as 1.80 percent early in the day. "Surely with all the hype about the minutes coming out, I think we're back to where we were all along, with the debate in the Fed. The market never thought November was in the offing. It's clearly about December," Krosby said. Krosby said utilities have been very oversold. "I think the utilities is a contrarian bet that a rate hike is already discounted in the market, that the market knows the rate hike is coming and the utilities have been sold off," she said. She said banks and utilities do not usually go up in tandem as they did Wednesday. It made sense that banks were on the move since they are more likely to benefit from rising interest rates. Yields have been moving higher in the Treasury market this week, with the 10-year breaking back to the levels it was at in early June, before the U.K. Brexit vote to leave the European Union. The Fed minutes showed the Fed was close to hiking rates and included comments from Fed officials who had dissented against the decision in September to keep rates steady. "It's just telling us that they were indeed very close to pulling the trigger and resuming their gradual pace of rate hikes," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. "They just didn't do it. It looks like the doves won out. But all this talk of it being a close call suggest to me that [Fed Chair Janet] Yellen more or less bought off the hawks by saying we didn't go today, but we'll go later this year." There are a few economic reports Thursday including the jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. EDT, import prices at 8:30 a.m. and the federal budget at 2 p.m. Patti DommCNBC Executive News Editor Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change DAL --- S&P 500 --- SHOW COMMENTS Please add a username to view or add comments Public Username for Commenting JOIN THE DISCUSSION To learn more about how we use your information, please read our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

Eberhardt La Coronel comes home strong to win the JPMorgan Chase Jessamine Stakes Print Email Facebook Twitter Comment Team Casse has another talented turf filly on their hands. While champion Tepin is the barn's undisputed queen and Canadian Horse of the Year Catch a Glimpse commands her own respect, John Oxley's 2-year-old La Coronel showed she's worthy to tread in their hoofprints with a powerful 4 1/4-length victory Oct. 12 in the $150,000 JPMorgan Chase Jessamine Stakes (gr. IIIT). Watch Video The daugher of Colonel John   also punched her ticket to the Nov. 4 Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf (gr. IT) under jockey Florent Geroux as part of the Breeders' Cup Challenge "Win and You're In" program. "Oh yeah, I think we're in," trainer Mark Casse said. "My son Norman has done a good job with this filly. She's kind of excitable and he got her ready for this today. When she broke her maiden up at Saratoga (Sept. 5), Florent came back and said, 'I think we have another Catch a Glimpse.'" Sent off the 9-5 favorite in a field of 12, La Coronel tracked fourth along the inside in the 1 1/16-mile turf test for juvenile fillies as Kentucky Juvenile Fillies Stakes winner Lull pressed the pace set by longshot Divine Humor. After posting early fractions of :22.89 and :47.37, Divine Humor backed up suddenly in the far turn, and Lull took over to run three-quarters in 1:13.57 into the stretch. But La Coronel was driving hard and put her away with a 1:37.35 mile, then increased her margin to soar clear under the line. "When you ride good horses, they make it easier for you," Geroux said. "We had a good trip. She put me exactly where we needed to be. When I asked her down the lane, she just exploded—very nice turn of foot and that was it. When I pushed the gas, it was just a matter of how far she was going to win by." The final time was 1:43.37 on a firm course. La Coronel was the fifth stakes-winning juvenile for Casse in the past five days, joining Claiborne Breeders' Futurity (gr. I) winner Classic Empire, Grey Stakes (Can-III) winner Golden Hawk, Dixiana Bourbon Stakes (gr. IIIT) winner Keep Quiet, and Mazarine Stakes (Can-III) winner Gale Force.  The winner returned $5.80, $4.20, and $3, while Lull paid $5.40 and $4.80. Rum Go brought $17.40 to show. Sweeping Paddy, Majestic Bonnie, Liberale, Tapa Tapa Tapa, Lipstick City, Majestic Gale, Wicked Lick, Zero Zee, and Divine Humor completed the order of finish. La Coronel was bred in Kentucky by Kim Nardelli, Rodney Nardelli, Susan Bunning, A. Jaffreys, and B. Jaffreys, out of the graded stakes-placed Chester House mare Listen.

Stocks fell in early trading in Europe on Friday, Sept. 16, 2016, led by banks as Deutsche Bank shares tumbled following news the U.S. Justice Department is seeking a $14 billion settlement over its dealings in mortgage-backed securities before the 2008 financial crisis. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) comments NEW YORK — Stocks were moderately lower Friday, pushed down, in part, by the price of oil. Investors continue to remain on edge regarding the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates at its meeting next week. Banks also fell, led by a plunge in Deutsche Bank after the giant German lender said it wouldn't settle with the Department of Justice over its handling of mortgage securities in the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis.   The article you requested is no longer available on BostonHerald.com.   » Click here to view this article in the Associated Press' archive.

"We remain where we were: a market still betting Chair Yellen wants a hike in December," said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. "Mark your calendar for December 13 to 14 to see if Yellen sticks to the message she's been telegraphing since Jackson Hole." Fed officials in favor of hiking interest rates worried that waiting too long could send the country into recession, the minutes showed. Andrew Renneisen | Getty Images Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange Three Fed policymakers dissented at the Federal Open Market Committee's September meeting. Those who agreed with the decision then to keep rates unchanged said in the minutes that it was "appropriate to await further evidence of continued progress toward the Committee's statutory objectives." "I think it was fairly neutral, although it's telling me there's very active debate about whether or not to raise," said Eric Stein, co-director of global income at Eaton Vance. "To me, it's a lot about who Yellen is following. Last year, it seemed Yellen was following [Fed Vice Chairman Stanley] Fischer; this year, it seems like it's [Fed Governor Lael] Brainard." Stocks fell sharply on Tuesday, with the three major U.S. indexes dropping more than 1 percent. On Wednesday, stocks struggled for direction before ending little changed. The S&P 500 closed less than 3 points higher, with real estate up nearly 1.4 percent and utilities up 1 percent as the top advancers. Financials held slight gains of about 0.15 percent. Kim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital, said the move in financial stocks "could be that people are repositioning ahead of Friday's bank earnings." Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup are all slated to post quarterly results Friday before the bell. The Dow Jones industrial average closed off session highs, with Travelers Cos., Apple and McDonald's contributing the most to gains. The iPhone maker's stock posted its first seven-day win streak since the one ended in February 2015. The Nasdaq composite closed a touch lower, weighed by declines in Cisco and Biogen. Ahead of the minutes' release on Wednesday, New York Fed President William Dudley characterized U.S. inflation expectations as "well-anchored." Dudley also said if the Fed were to redo its quantitative easing, or asset purchase program, that "we would have gotten to a more aggressive posture sooner than we did." The market is largely anticipating the Fed to raise interest rates later this year, with fed funds futures pricing in a more than 65 percent probability for a hike in December, but just 20 percent for November, according to RBS. Bond yields around the world rose on Wednesday, with the benchmark U.S. 10-year note yield near 1.78 percent after the Fed minutes release. The 10-year German bund yield rose to 0.068 percent, while Spain's 10-year yield hit its highest level since July 25. The Treasury Department sold $24 billion in three-year notes, an auction which saw the highest yield since January. The department also sold $20 billion in 10-year notes in an auction which saw weak demand. Earlier, both the 10-year yield and 2-year yield hit their highest levels since June 3 of 1.801 percent and 0.891 percent, respectively, according to Reuters. "I think it's all about rates and discounting the coming rate hike" from the Fed, said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. "I think yesterday's debacle was mostly due to yields moving to a new, higher trend. I think that spooked the market a little bit." US 10-year yield in 2016Source: FactSet In oil markets, U.S. crude settled 1.2 percent lower at $50.18 a barrel, while traders weighed talks between OPEC and other oil-exporting nations on curbing output. Investors also kept an eye on quarterly corporate reports, as earnings season kicked off Tuesday with Alcoa posting weaker-than-expected results. Maris Ogg, president at Tower Bridge Advisors, said the weak start to the season is adding more skittishness to the market. "Couple that with high valuations, I think it's no surprise to see buyers waiting until they see the numbers," she said. Ultimately, "I think earnings will be fine and this will dissipate." Railroad giant CSX is expected to report quarterly results Wednesday after the bell. In economic news, mortgage applications fell 6 percent last week as rising rates weighed. The August job openings and labor turnover survey, also released Wednesday, showed the number of job opening falling to 5.4 million. Overseas, European markets were mostly lower, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index falling 0.47 percent as sentiment was dented by the U.S. session's poor performance Tuesday. In afternoon ET, Reuters reported the European Central Bank may discuss technical changes to its quantitative easing program next week, but may wait until December to decide whether it will extend the program beyond next March. "We've seen this movie play before. Whenever we see the markets in trouble, central banks come in and try to influence investors," said Adam Sarhan, CEO at Sarhan Capital. " Clearly, they're doing their very best to keep equity markets higher." In currency markets, the U.S. dollar index traded slightly higher, extending the week's gains. The euro was near $1.102 and the yen around 104.23 versus the greenback. The British pound steadied after a sharp decline Tuesday to trade about 0.75 higher near $1.2214.

The S&P 500 closed up 2.44 points, or 0.11 percent, at 2,139.17, with real estate leading eight sectors higher and health care the greatest decliner. The Nasdaq composite closed down 7.77 points, or 0.15 percent, at 5,239.02. Advancers were a touch ahead of decliners on the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 680 million and a composite volume of nearly 2.9 billion in the close. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, edged above 15.5. Gold futures for December delivery fell $2.10 to settle at $1,253.80 per ounce. —CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.

Snap plans to go public as early as next March. Bloomberg cites unnamed insiders saying that JPMorgan Chase , Deutsche Bank, Allen & Co., Barclays and Credit Suisse will also be involved in the IPO. Snap Inc. is currently being valued $18 billion. Its Snapchat service currently has 150 million daily active users, and in fact surpassed Twitter on this front earlier this year. The company behind Snapchat recently renamed itself to Snap Inc., and announced the launch of its first hardware product last month: Snapchat Spectacles are video-enabled sunglasses that allow wearers to record short video clips and share them on Snapchat. The product will likely sell in limited quantities for $130 later this year, and isn’t expected to generate significant revenue for Snap Inc. in the near future. The money-maker for Snap Inc. is still Snapchat itself, which aims to bring in more than $350 million in ad revenue in 2016. Filed Under: Snap Inc. Snapchat Want to read more articles like this one?

It has more than 150 million daily active users and aims to generate more than $350 million in advertising revenue this year, up from $59 million in 2015, people familiar with its plans have said. Because the company’s revenue is less than $1 billion, it qualifies to file IPO documents confidentially with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Snap’s Value Snap, with a private market value of $18 billion after its last funding round, will be the largest social media IPO since Twitter Inc. in November 2013. Los Angeles-based Snap plans to go public even as other large startups, such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc., take more time, raising private capital or borrowing money instead. Morgan Stanley’s lead role comes after the bank arranged a credit facility for Snap in September. Snap’s sale is poised to be the biggest U.S. technology IPO that Morgan Stanley has served as left-lead adviser on since Facebook Inc. went public in 2012. Mary Ritti, a spokeswoman for Snapchat, declined to comment, as did representatives for Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Barclays and Deutsche Bank. Representatives for Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan and Allen & Co. didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Video provided by TheStreet Newslook Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 7, (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) (Photo: Spencer Platt, Getty Images) After yesterday's down day on earnings worries, U.S. stocks closed mixed to slightly higher Wednesday as traders reacted to the release of the minutes of last month's Federal Reserve meeting, which suggested an interest rate hike is coming "relatively soon." Most investors say the Fed minutes, which noted that it was a "close call" to hold off on rate hikes at the September meeting, suggests the Fed is still on track for a December rate hike if economic data, including the labor market, continues to come in strong. That message jibes with futures markets, which continues to price in a nearly 70% chance of a hike at the December meeting. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 15.54 points, or 0.1%, to 18,144.20. The broad Standard & Poor's 500 stock index gained 2.45, or 0.1%, to 2139.18 and the Nasdaq fell 7.77, or 0.2%, to 5239.02. The Fed minutes delivered no surprises, says Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones. "The minutes are consistent with another rate hike in December but didn't make a December move more likely," Warne told USA TODAY. "Some (Fed members) wanted to move relatively soon while others wanted to wait for more convincing evidence of rising inflation. This is still a Fed that's cautious, patient and positive for rising stocks over time." A poor start to the third-quarter earnings season Tuesday got Wall Street's attention. A miss from aluminum maker Alcoa knocked the Dow down 200 points and raised concerns that the hoped-for profit rebound won't materialize in the July-thru-September quarter. With just 27 companies in the S&P 500 having reported results so far, earnings are seen contracting 0.7%, according to earnings-tracker Thomson Reuters, putting earnings on track for their fifth straight quarter of negative growth. While Alcoa is no longer in the Dow, nor is it considered the economic bellwether it once was, the broad stock market has tended to struggle after Alcoa, whose earnings report is viewed as the unofficial start to earnings season, plunges after a poor earnings report. In fact, after the prior 10 times Alcoa fell more than 5% on earnings report day, the S&P 500 was down an average 2.5% for the remainder of the earnings season, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Up next is a profit report from railroad CSX today after the closing bell, then Wynn Resorts and Delta Airlines tomorrow and major banks Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup Friday. USA TODAY New market risk: A Democratic election sweep The main event today is the Fed minutes. At its September meeting the U.S. central bank opted to keep rates unchanged, but left the door open for a rate hike later this year. There was also division among the Fed voters, as three dissenters called for a hike last month. Wall Street will be watching the minutes for clues as to the timing of the next hike, although futures markets are already pricing in a nearly 70% chance the Janet Yellen-led Fed will move for the first time this year at its December meeting, according to CME Group. On Fed minute release days in 2016, the S&P 500 has posted average gains of 0.24% heading into the 2 p.m. release, and gained an additional 0.11% into the close for an average daily gain of 0.35%, according to Bespoke. However, stocks have fallen 0.71% the day after the release of the minutes, as investors come to grips with the reality that the Fed will eventually hike rate at some point. "It’s been a relatively calm start to trading on Wednesday as investors await the release of the September Fed minutes and look for rate hike clues ahead of the final two meetings of the year," Craig Erlam senior market analyst at OANDA, told USA TODAY via e-mail. "Of those two meetings, November appears all but off the table coming a week before the U.S. presidential election and not being accompanied by a press conference, giving Yellen an opportunity to explain the decision and what it means for monetary policy going forward." The rising odds of a Fed rate hike pushed the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note above 1.8% early in Wednesday's session to a four-month high. The 10-year note last traded above 1.8% back on June 3 and it last closed above that level on June 2. It's latest yield is 1.771%. New York Fed president William Dudley, a close ally of Yellen, said in a speech Wednesday that the Fed can be "gentle" in raising rates since the U.S. economy has "plenty of room to run." Another weight on the market was a 1.2% drop in the value of U.S.-produced crude which slipped to $50.19 per barrel. In currencies, the U.S. dollar continued to move higher, edging up 0.13%. And in the UK the British pound stabilized, rising 0.6%, after UK Prime Minister gave the OK for parliamentary vote related to her plans for Britain's exit from the European Union. That raised some hope that the UK would not opt for a so-called "hard Brexit," a phrased used to describe a deal in which Britain keeps control of its borders but gets less economically friendly access to the single-market EU. Stocks were lower in Asia, with Japan's Nikkei 225 off 1.1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index down 0.6%. In Europe, the broad Stoxx Europe 600 index was 0.5% lower and Germany's DAX index was off 0.6% and the CAC 40 in Paris was off 0.5%.

Miller of FBR Capital Markets told "Squawk Box" that major banks have already experienced "tempered loan growth," in the wake of Wells Fargo's $185 million phony accounts settlement with regulators. The Wells scandal has resulted in two heated hearings on Capitol Hill and CEO John Stumpf forfeiting about $41 million in unvested equity. Stumpf has agreed to forgo his salary while the board investigates the matter. The banking industry has faced increased government scrutiny recently. "I just hope they're not on a witch hunt," Miller said. Deutsche Bank has been talking with the Justice Department about settling investigations into mortgage-backed securities sales in the lead-up the 2008 financial crisis. The DOJ has said it wants the German lender to pay a $14 billion fine. With headwinds like these facing the industry, Miller said, it's unlikely that any one bank will beat earnings expectations. show chapters <p>Q3 earnings winners and laggards</p> <p>We may get some revenue growth here, says Christine Short, Estimize senior vice president, providing her outlook on earnings season and sharing her take on which sectors to watch.</p> Q3 earnings winners and laggards    Wednesday, 12 Oct 2016 | 6:35 AM ET | 03:52 Estimize's Christine Short told "Squawk Box" that the energy sector also faltered this quarter. The category was supposed to see a big earnings comeback, but instead has seen a decline in profits. Meanwhile, increasingly value-focused consumers are throwing a small wrench in overall earnings predictions, said Short. After kicking off earnings season on a shaky note with Alcoa's disappointment and across-the-board downward revisions, predictions need to change on their own based on a shift in how consumers choose to spend their money, Short said. "Consumer confidence is still OK," she said. "They're just being picky with how they allocate their income." Short said fast food companies — a number of which have pushed to introduce fresh, wholesome ingredients to their menus — are doing particularly well among value-driven consumers. Health care, consumer discretionary and technology were the best performers in the third quarter, Short said.

MOSCOW (Sputnik) — Joshua Aaron, a US national suspected of the largest hacking of Wall Street and also accused of stealing data on over 100 million clients of the JPMorgan Chase Bank, who is expecting his deportation from Russia, is not entitled to seek asylum in the country, a source in the Russian law enforcement agencies told RIA Novosti on Wednesday. "According to the Russian law, a refugee is someone who is persecuted or oppressed on grounds of racial, religious, ethic hatred or a political motive. He [Aaron] does not qualify for any of these categories," the source said. © Flickr/ Dennis Skley US Citizen Suspected of Wall Street Hacking, Fraud Asked for Asylum in RussiaIn May, the Moscow City Court found Aaron guilty of violating the conditions of his visa, fined him and ordered his deportation. Following the ruling, Aaron applied for asylum in Russia. His request was denied, but he appealed that decision which led to his deportation process temporarily put on hold. According to the source, Aaron's request for political asylum in Russia is just an attempt to delay deportation from the country. The source also added, that Aaron was behaving in a manner that showed disrespect to the country's laws. "A foreigner, who resides in the country illegally and holds an expired visa is to be deported. And those who fail to leave Russia before a fixed deadline voluntarily are to be deported forcefully. He requested an asylum not when he arrived, but after he was arrested and taken into custody," the source continued. The United States are seeking extradition of Aaron, who is suspected of money laundering, computer hacking and fraud at several financial institutions, including the JPMorgan Chase Bank. ...

Business Market Report: Rand’s fall prompts City to check out of South Africa Jamie Nimmo Wednesday 12 October 2016 12:50 BST Profit-taking: The FTSE 100 fell back from all-time highs AFP/Getty Sterling’s pounding may be hitting the headlines here, but it pales into insignificance when compared with the rand’s dive, which has triggered a sell-off of South African firms. The currency’s slide — more than 4% yesterday against the dollar — continued after the country’s finance minister Pravin Gordhan was summoned to appear in court next month on fraud charges. The weaker rand knocked Anglo-African financial services groups Old Mutual, which fell a further 3.2p, or 1.6%, to 194.5p, and Investec, down 3.7p to 487p. It also hit South Africa-based private hospitals group Mediclinic, which was 10p weaker at 888.5p. Mediclinic shot into the FTSE 100 earlier this year after its reverse takeover by Middle Eastern group Al Noor. After briefly hitting new highs yesterday, the FTSE 100, off 31.69 points at 7039.19, succumbed to some profit taking with investors wary of the post-Brexit rally. David Davis plays down talk of 'hard' or 'soft' Brexit It comes after steel giant Alcoa, which traditionally starts the firing gun for earnings season on Wall Street, disappointed with weak third-quarter results. Traders were also nervy ahead of a big reporting day for US banks on Friday, with JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo all set for their results. Mexican silver miner Fresnillo was among the blue-chip fallers, down 32p, or 1.9%, to 1615p as its third-quarter silver production fell 9.4% against the previous quarter, mainly because of lower grades. ITV failed to recover from recent falls, down another 2p at 175.6p. Today, UBS said the fall reflected “fair value” for the shares.  Analyst Richard Eary put the decline down to weaker advertising, concerns of a hard Brexit, and the broadcaster’s ratings underwhelming despite the success of new shows such as the return of Cold Feet. Read more Cold Feet viewers praise ‘best episode ever’ over euthanasia scene Citi sparked investor interest in Electrocomponents by upgrading the electronic parts distributor to Neutral from Sell, picking it out as one of the firms to benefit from the pound’s tumble. Citi lifted its annual pre-tax profit forecast from £86 million to £102 million, helping shares to climb 9.2p, or 2.53%, to  373.2p — their highest level in 12 years. Drug developer Synairgen was in need of a shot in the arm after its partner AstraZeneca ditched a Phase II study of its asthma treatment. The AIM-listed firm, which struck a licensing deal with the drugs giant in 2014 worth $232 million (£189 million), was off 12.5p to 21.5p. Fracking firm IGas fell 1.67p to 12.33p after it asked bondholders for a temporary waiver on its obligations amid concerns over its debts. Orders for Biffa’s float closed today. The waste management firm is raising £270 million in a listing that will value it at around £700 million, rather than the £1 billion previously reported.

Follow @Reganonymous Facebook Twitter Email Print Share Oct 12, 2016 7:30 AM EDT WELLS FARGO & CO +0.10 At Closing, Nov 11th 51.73 USD JPMORGAN CHASE & CO +0.04 At Closing, Nov 11th 76.69 USD Among the steady drumbeat of negative news for Wells Fargo in the wake of its fake-account scandal, the most troubling headlines may be those telling of lost business because of the bank's shredded reputation. Illinois, California, Seattle and Chicago are among those that have all announced recently that they were refraining from working with the bank. Silent Majority Mom-and-pop investors don't announce when they're turning their backs on Wells Fargo Source: Bloomberg This lost business, mostly in municipal-bond underwriting, shouldn't be enough to move the needle much on Wells Fargo's bottom line. The bulk of its business is centered on the banking needs of retail mom-and-pop customers -- and those clients don't issue press releases or write open letters to announce that they're turning their backs on the bank. So a question that will linger, perhaps even beyond the bank's latest earnings release this week, is how many of these customers will decide to flee. One hint may be in how often the bank's mobile application is downloaded. The app's rank in iOS and Google Play stores has taken a noticeable hit, sending the gap between it and apps from Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase to the widest level since 2014, according to analysts at UBS. (See Figure 4 at this link.) That is obviously an imperfect measure of consumer behavior, as the analysts pointed out, but it certainly hints at a slowdown in new accounts and engagement among customers.   Wells Fargo has increased deposits briskly in recent years, so it would require a full-scale mutiny for the situation to become acute. However, should an exodus of retail customers become problematic, there is one lever the bank could consider pulling to help keep mom and pop from jumping ship: interest rates on savings and checking accounts and certificates of deposits.   The effect of higher benchmark interest rates -- like the fed funds rate or more variable rates like Libor  --- on the rates paid to savers is known as deposit beta.  The conventional wisdom has been that deposit betas would be minuscule -- almost nonexistent -- during the initial few interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve. That would allow banks to benefit from, say, the first 50 basis points of rate increases as they pass along higher borrowing costs to customers but not  much of the gain to depositors.  That seems to have been the case when looking at certificate of deposit rates after the 25 basis point increase last year: Suffering Savers The Fed's first interest rate increase at the end of 2015 didn't have a noticeable effect on rates paid on certificates of deposits, which have languished near record lows Source: Bankrate.com, Bloomberg Note: CD rates are national averages based on a data from Bankrate.com That proved to be a wise move for banks because yield curves flattened during the year after the first rate increase, pressuring net interest margins. Now the Fed seems to be telegraphing that the next 25 basis point increase will come at the end of this year, and yield curves are steepening again.  What if, instead of hoarding most of the benefits of higher rates, Wells Fargo were to more aggressively pass the increase along to customers? It would not take too much to make the rates on certificates of deposit stand out among the bank's largest competitors: CD Neighborhood Interest rates on certificates of deposit vary among the big banks Source: Company websites CD rates can vary depending on location and amount deposited. See bank websites for more details. These rates were based on entering either a Manhattan ZIP code or New York State for location. Rates are based on a minimum deposit of $5,000 for Wells Fargo and deposits of less than $10,000 for others. As you can see from the chart above, Wells Fargo offers a "bonus" rate on CDs. How does one qualify for this "bonus" from the bank? Cross-selling, of course! The rate is paid to customers who maintain a "linked PMA Package," incentives to persuade customers to open other accounts and link them to a Wells Fargo checking account.   CDs are only a fraction of Wells Fargo's deposits. Checking accounts, which pay practically nothing in interest, and savings accounts, which pay about 8 or 10 basis points, are a bigger deal, and an increase in their rates might be even more soothing to miffed customers. Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf has said in the past that he dreams at night about checking accounts, and the first thing he looks at when he gets to work at 5:30 a.m. is the bank's deposits. The reason for those dreams? Primary checking accounts are about three times as profitable as secondary accounts, he has said. He's also said the bank's deposits should remain "sticky" even if higher interest rates cause customers to start shopping around.   It makes you wonder whether Stumpf still dreams about checking accounts and whether those dreams are as pleasant as they once were. And it makes you wonder what those 5:30 a.m. deposit checks are like these days. Are those deposits as sticky as they once were? Or could they use a little more glue -- in the form of higher interest rates? This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.

"Cloud9 has ushered trader communication into the modern age, while bringing mobility, enhanced compliance and security, and more agile communication to the industry.  With the close of this round, our team is poised to continue development of products and services that will change the way the financial industry and enterprise businesses communicate and collaborate." To date, more than 2,700 users in 29 countries have adopted Cloud9. Firms have cited several reasons for Cloud9's popularity among financial services professionals, including the platform's ease-of-use, mobility features, strong value proposition and interoperability with other solutions. "Cloud9's technology inspired us to revisit our trader voice communication strategy and related workflow," said Rick Smith, Head of Private Investments at JPMorgan Chase. "We believe that Cloud9 will empower traders through its ease of use and management, while improving efficiency, enhancing compliance and reducing communications costs." Cloud9 will use the funding to support innovation, accelerate the development of several products in great demand by its customer base and expand the service offering into new markets.  Most recently, Cloud9 opened an office in Singapore to meet growing demand in the Asia Pacific region, and the company has plans to expand operations in other markets by early next year. "The rapid growth of Cloud9 since the company's launch in 2014 has paralleled the industry's adoption of cloud technology and we've seen the opportunity to extend the platform's benefits into areas such as workflow, compliance and advanced analytics," said Richard Kerschner, Chief Corporate Development Officer of ICAP's Post Trade, Risk and Information Services Division. "Cloud9 is best positioned to provide next generation solutions that will create improved efficiency and additional benefits for traders, brokers, and other financial market players." ICAP's participation was led by Euclid Opportunities, ICAP's investment arm focused on emerging fintech companies. "We believe Cloud9 is an emerging leader in transforming the way the buy-side and sell-side communicate across the capital markets," said Pete Casella, Partner at Point72 Ventures. "We are excited to partner with Jerry and his team to help attract more of our peers and trading counterparts into the Cloud9 ecosystem." "We have been using Cloud9 since the beginning," said Michael Intrator, President and CEO of Hudson Ridge Asset Management, LLC.  "We chose to personally invest in Cloud9 because the technology has been reliable, and transformative for us.  We believe that the company has a future that extends beyond creating an integrated lifecycle around trading communications and beyond the finance industry." In July, Cloud9 announced the successful launch of its Gateway Service, which connects Cloud9 users to their counterparties, even if they are not yet using the Cloud9 application. This kind of interoperability gives traders and brokers an edge, allowing them to connect with counterparties that they otherwise might not have had access to via the Cloud9 community. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz served as legal advisor to Cloud9 in connection with the funding round, which commenced earlier in 2016.  About Cloud9 Technologies Cloud9 Technologies is a cloud communications service provider that delivers high performance voice and collaboration services designed for the unique functional and compliance needs of institutional traders.
