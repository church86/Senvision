"The homeless are more than just nameless faces on our streets; they're our mothers, our fathers and in some cases our children," Turner said. "Homelessness is a top priority for this administration because it is a top priority for Houstonians throughout the city of Houston. That being said, a transformative shift has a occurred in the way that we as a community respond to homelessness." The city devised a plan last year to build 2,500 permanent housing units that are funding mostly through local and federal government support, Turner said. However, the city is still short $15 million for funding its project. The City of Houston has raised an estimated $7 million dollars, and with JP Morgan Chase's $1 million donation, the city is half way toward its financial goal. "We believe we have a responsibility to help the communities where we work address their social and economic challenges," JP Morgan vice-President of Philanthropy Carolyn Watson said. "Every year, the JP Morgan Chase Foundation awards over $200 million to non-profits around the globe. These non-profits are vitalizing neighborhoods, equipping people to secure better jobs and helping them build financial assets for the future." The city has shifted from managing homelessness to solving it by focusing on providing a permanent housing solution for these individuals, the mayor said. "It is pretty simple. If you are homeless, you are literally, literally without a home. That should be no surprise that housing is the solution to homeless," Turner said. He said the organizations and agencies responsible for working with Houston's homeless have also switched from working in independently to collaborating consistently and embracing shared goals while combining their resources to maximize their impact. The mayor said more than 100 local are organization are working together through The Way Home program, which is Houston's regional and collaborative homeless responsive system. "Everything The Way Home does is geared toward one purpose: transiting the homeless off of our streets and into supportive housing," the mayor said. "Besides housing disabled veterans and those with children, we are strategically focused on housing our most vulnerable homeless individuals." Turner said this includes those with disabilities who have been living on the streets for at least a year.  Over the years, the chronically homeless have accounted for 30 percent of Houston's homeless population while utilizing nearly 70 percent of the city's resources for the demographic. The city estimates over nearly $103 million of taxpayers' dollars are spent providing the chronically homeless with temporary shelter, police response, emergency services, and covering jail and emergency room costs. "It is actually less expensive to house the chronically homeless with supportive services than it is merely to walk by them on the streets of the city of Houston," Turner said. "Housing our homeless is more than a plan or an admiration, it is already being done on a daily basis." Turner said a permanent housing solution will save the taxpayers an average of $28,000 per person which adds up to an estimated $70.6 million each year. Through its current initiative, the city has rescued nearly 7,500 individuals from the street — more than 3,000 of whom were constituted as chronically homeless. "Our goal is to virtually end chronic homeless in the city of Houston," Turner said.

Higher Education Elementary and Primary Education Forum Jim Guidry Commentaries Harris County Houston Mayor's News Conference by Garrett Bryce w/Photos courtesy HTV Thursday, October 20, 2016 Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, in a news conference today, accepted a $1 million grant from JP Morgan Chase for the city's The Way Home program to combat homelessness in the city. The grant will support The Way Home's homeless housing initiative, and JPMorgan Chase is the first corporate donor for the event. The Way Home program has now raised $7 million toward its $15 million goal to finish creating 2,500 units of housing for chronically homeless individuals. News Release Turner stated that more than 100 organizations were collaborating through The Way Home program. “Everything The Way Home does is geared towards one purpose, transitioning the homeless off our streets and into supportive housing,” Turner said. Listen (24:41) Turner noted that by putting homeless in homes can actually save $28,000 for each chronically homeless individual, for a potential total of more than $70 million per year. “In fact, it is actually less expensive to house the chronically homeless with supportive services than it is merely to walk by them on the streets of the city of Houston,” he said. Turner introduced JPMorgan Chase Vice President of Philanthropy Carolyn Watson, who announced the grant, and discussed the JPMorgan Chase's award of more than $200 million to nonprofits around the globe. “These nonprofits are revitalizing neighborhoods, equipping people to secure better jobs, and helping them build financial assets for the future,” Watson said. Watson noted Houston's efforts to decrease homelessness, which has resulted in a 57 percent decrease in overall homelessness over the past five years. “The Way Home is an example of Houston at its best,” Watson said. Central Houston, Inc. President Bob Eury spoke on the plan to build housing units, stating that 2,237 operating or in development, 56 pending financial approval, and 207 remain to be created out of the total 2,500 units. Katrina Van ValkenburghThe Corporation for Supportive Housing, which manages the fund for the program, also spoke during the news conference. Van Valkenburgh thanked Turner, JPMorgan Chase, partners in the program, and the residents of Houston. “Because of each and every one of you, ending homelessness in this community is more than a slogan, it's a reality,” she said. Turner stressed the importance of ending homelessness. “We can go to the moon, we can even travel to Mars, but if we can't take care of those who are traveling right here in this city, we still have missed the mark,” Turner said.

Bank of America dedicated an entire slide of its third-quarter earnings presentation this week to "digital banking trends," while JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo mentioned mobile user trends in their latest earnings reports. Bank of America is "investing a lot of money in making sure they can maintain digital banking trends," said Erik Oja, equity analyst at CFRA Research (formerly S&P), which has a buy recommendation on the stock. The bank is trying to find ways to lower expenses and generate revenue in a world of low interest rates, he said. "I think technological innovation plays into those themes … and they have the resources, much more resources than European banks or community banks," Oja said. "All the major banks are working at this." In the BofA presentation, the bank said digital accounted for 18 percent of total sales. The bank also came out first in tech research firm Forrester's 2016 ranking of U.S. mobile banking functionality and 2015 study on U.S. bank digital sales functionality. "Bank of America would be right to think they are in a good position and they are leading when it comes to offering digital experiences among their traditional competition set," said Peter Wannemacher, senior analyst at Forrester Research, which compiled the studies. "But their traditional competition set is not all that matters." Mobile banking apps increasingly allow customers to conduct basic tasks, such as depositing a check, transferring money between accounts or setting up appointments with banking professionals. But competition has been rising with the growth of nonbank apps such as Venmo, which allows users to send money to each other, or TransferWise, which facilitates international transactions. More than half of American adults believe technology providers are more secure or as secure as banks, according to consumer research of more than 1,000 U.S. adults last December by YouGov and TransferWise. Looking out over the next decade, more than three-fourths of Americans in the study said they would trust a technology company with at least some of their financial services needs. "Any bank that has a huge percentage of its business from retail banking or consumer-facing products, they'll want to have strong digital" products, said Joe Cross, general manager of North America at TransferWise. "It is very easy now for customers to shift between banks," he said. For now, customers appear to be conducting more business digitally with banks such as Bank of America. The second-largest U.S. bank by assets said Monday that digital transfers and bill payments totaled $243 billion in the third quarter, up from $229 billion in the period last year. "What they're seeing is proof that banking is still valuable and important to people," Wannemacher said. "We're not yet 15 years down the road. Serving customers through digital channels … has a positive impact on business outcomes." Bank of America also said digitally made appointments for visits to the financial center jumped to 343,000 from 161,000 last year. "Why are they coming? Usually for a much more important financial transaction to them then handing us a check for deposit, and so it's quality versus quantity and making sure we understand that," CEO Brian Moynihan said on the bank's conference call Monday. JPMorgan said in its third-quarter earnings report that active mobile customers rose 17 percent from the same period last year to 26 million. And in a breakdown of impact to customers from its sales scandal, Wells Fargo said total digital online and mobile secure sessions still rose 13 percent in September from last year. The other major banks have less of a consumer-facing business but digital technology was a topic of their third-quarter conference calls. Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said Tuesday that the firm's technology strategy was focused on client engagement. Last week, the bank launched an online consumer lending business called Marcus. The digitalization of finance has picked up more quickly in Asia, where Citi said it is the largest credit card issuer and 1 in 4 credit cards is now acquired online. Ninety percent of Citi customer transactions in Asia take place outside a branch, the bank said.

Embed from Getty Images   Bloomberg News reports that the bank is in discussions with First Capital Securities, its partner in JPMorgan First Capital Securities, over its minority shareholding, the Chinese firm said in a statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange that didn’t identify any potential buyers. No agreement has been reached, according to the statement. JPMorgan wants to find a new partner for a venture in which it can wield greater control, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified. HSBC, which remained on the sidelines as JPMorgan and rivals like Credit Suisse set up minority-owned entities, last year announced plans for a China securities partnership in which it will hold a controlling stake. “Having a minority stake in a China joint venture is no longer attractive because their role is rather passive and they only have limited participation,” Wong Chi Man, a Hong Kong-based analyst at China Galaxy Securities Co., said by phone. “I wouldn’t be surprised if other foreign firms follow suit.” To access the complete Bloomberg News article hit the link below: JPMorgan Weighs Exiting China Venture as Banks Seek Control Rickmers Investors Seek Bond Payment as Singapore Stresses Rise And the Best Place to Work in the global financial markets 2016 is...

Toggle Navigation A-   A+ Sign in News   Stock Home «Back JPMorgan in talks to sell out of Chinese securities JV Reuters | HONG KONG Oct 20, 2016 01:40 PM IST By Sumeet Chatterjee and Julie Zhu HONG KONG (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co is in talks to sell out of a Chinese securities joint venture with First Capital Securities Co Ltd in what would be the first departure by a top-tier global investment bank from China's securities segment. Wall Street banks like JPMorgan hold only minority stakes in such ventures. The resulting lack of control and limited contribution to total revenue have brought banks frustration at a time when domestic competition has become acute. Almost all leading investment banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, UBS Group AG, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG have securities ventures with local firms. Shenzhen-listed broker First Capital, in an exchange filing on Thursday, said it is in talks to buy JPMorgan's 33 percent of JP Morgan First Capital Securities Co. It said no transaction has been finalised and that any purchase remains uncertain. JPMorgan confirmed the content of the filing. "China is a key market for the firm globally and for many of our clients outside China. J.P. Morgan believes in the long term prospects of China and remains fully committed to our China franchise," the U.S. bank said in an emailed statement. Neither JPMorgan nor First Capital gave reasons for the move. Some analysts said the U.S. bank could return to China's securities market with a new partner as the outlook for onshore deals remains attractive. Rival Morgan Stanley launched a securities joint venture with Huaxin Securities in 2011, a year after it sold its 34.3 percent of China International Capital Corp Ltd (CICC), the country's top investment bank at the time. "It has been a difficult ride (for foreign banks), but we really feel that it's at tipping point in terms of opportunities and the banks have just a lot left on the table," said Benjamin Quinlan, CEO of financial services consultancy Quinlan & Associates. "There is no alternative avenue for foreign players to go in and China is sending a clear signal that it is liberalising and I do think they (foreign banks) will be able to get to a stage where they have effective management control of the entity." China's securities regulator approved the establishment of JPMorgan First Capital Securities Co at the end of 2010. The venture, headquartered in Beijing, offers services such as stock and bond underwriting and merger advisory. It posted net profit of 52 million yuan ($7.72 million) for January-June, versus a loss of 23 million yuan in the same period a year earlier, showed information First Capital filed at the exchange. A stake sale would come as rival HSBC Holdings PLC awaits regulatory approval to launch a majority-owned joint venture, taking advantage of rules favouring Hong Kong-established banks. HSBC would own up to 51 percent of the venture, while the cap for other foreign banks in such ventures is 49 percent. China has been gradually opening up its financial sector, though some foreign banks have called for the pace to increase. Despite the challenges, no other top-tier foreign bank has exited securities joint ventures in China, betting on long-term opportunities in the world's second-largest economy. Foreign banks that have exited since 2007 include BNP Paribas SA, CLSA, Daiwa Securities Group Inc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, showed a Quinlan & Associates report.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files By Sumeet Chatterjee and Julie Zhu | HONG KONG HONG KONG JPMorgan Chase & Co is in talks to sell out of a Chinese securities joint venture with First Capital Securities Co Ltd in what would be the first departure by a top-tier global investment bank from China's securities segment. Wall Street banks like JPMorgan hold only minority stakes in such ventures. The resulting lack of control and limited contribution to total revenue have brought banks frustration at a time when domestic competition has become acute. Almost all leading investment banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, UBS Group AG, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG have securities ventures with local firms. Shenzhen-listed broker First Capital, in an exchange filing on Thursday, said it is in talks to buy JPMorgan's 33 percent of JP Morgan First Capital Securities Co. It said no transaction has been finalised and that any purchase remains uncertain. JPMorgan confirmed the content of the filing. "China is a key market for the firm globally and for many of our clients outside China. J.P. Morgan believes in the long term prospects of China and remains fully committed to our China franchise," the U.S. bank said in an emailed statement. Neither JPMorgan nor First Capital gave reasons for the move. Some analysts said the U.S. bank could return to China's securities market with a new partner as the outlook for onshore deals remains attractive. Rival Morgan Stanley launched a securities joint venture with Huaxin Securities in 2011, a year after it sold its 34.3 percent of China International Capital Corp Ltd (CICC), the country's top investment bank at the time. "It has been a difficult ride (for foreign banks), but we really feel that it's at tipping point in terms of opportunities and the banks have just a lot left on the table," said Benjamin Quinlan, CEO of financial services consultancy Quinlan & Associates. "There is no alternative avenue for foreign players to go in and China is sending a clear signal that it is liberalizing and I do think they (foreign banks) will be able to get to a stage where they have effective management control of the entity." China's securities regulator approved the establishment of JPMorgan First Capital Securities Co at the end of 2010. The venture, headquartered in Beijing, offers services such as stock and bond underwriting and merger advisory. It posted net profit of 52 million yuan ($7.72 million) for January-June, versus a loss of 23 million yuan in the same period a year earlier, showed information First Capital filed at the exchange. A stake sale would come as rival HSBC Holdings PLC awaits regulatory approval to launch a majority-owned joint venture, taking advantage of rules favoring Hong Kong-established banks. HSBC would own up to 51 percent of the venture, while the cap for other foreign banks in such ventures is 49 percent. China has been gradually opening up its financial sector, though some foreign banks have called for the pace to increase. Despite the challenges, no other top-tier foreign bank has exited securities joint ventures in China, betting on long-term opportunities in the world's second-largest economy. Foreign banks that have exited since 2007 include BNP Paribas SA, CLSA, Daiwa Securities Group Inc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, showed a Quinlan & Associates report.

PLEASE SEE THE IMPORTANT NOTICE AT THE END OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO CONTAIN INSIDE INFORMATION. Foresight Solar Fund Limited: Proposed Tap Issuance The Board of Foresight Solar Fund Limited (the 'Company') is pleased to announce a proposed tap issuance of up to 30,995,537 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (the 'New Shares'), representing approximately 9.99 per cent. of the Company's issued share capital at an issuance price of 103.00 pence per New Share (the 'Tap Issuance'). Foresight Group CI Limited (the 'Investment Manager') believes the UK solar market remains attractive, particularly given the recent recovery and positive momentum in UK wholesale power prices. As detailed in the Company's interim results released on 15 August 2016, the Investment Manager has identified an attractive pipeline of over 200MW to support the growth of the Company over the next twelve months.  From this pipeline, the Company has entered into exclusivity/binding agreements to purchase operational, fully accredited UK solar assets totaling 82MW which it expects to acquire before the year end. The assets under exclusivity are a combination of 1.4 and 1.3 ROC assets. The net proceeds of the proposed Tap Issuance will enable the Company to take advantage of these and other investment opportunities as and when they become available. The Tap Issuance is being conducted, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, through a bookbuild process which will be launched immediately following this announcement.  Stifel Nicolaus Europe Limited ('Stifel') and J.P. Morgan Securities plc, which carries on its UK investment banking activities as J.P. Morgan Cazenove ('J.P. Morgan Cazenove'), are acting as joint bookrunners in connection with the Tap Issuance.  Members of the public are not entitled to participate in the Tap Issuance. The Tap Issuance is being effected pursuant to the authority granted at the Company's General Meeting on 18 October 2016, permitting the allotment of up to 30,995,537 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (the 'Ordinary Shares') on a non pre-emptive basis. The Tap Issuance price of 103.00 pence per New Share is equal to the NAV per Ordinary Share of 100.7 pence as at 30 September 2016 plus an estimate of accrued income attributable to the Company since this date, plus a premium to cover issuance costs. The New Shares will, when issued, be fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing Ordinary Shares, including in respect of the right to receive all future dividends and distributions declared, made or paid by reference to a record date falling after their issue, including without limitation an entitlement to the third quarterly dividend of 1.54 pence in respect of the period from 1 July to 30 September 2016, which was approved by the Directors on 18 October 2016 and will be paid on 31 December 2016. The Company will apply for admission of the New Shares to listing on the premium listing segment of the Official List of the Financial Conduct Authority (the 'FCA') and to trading on the main market for listed securities of London Stock Exchange plc (the 'London Stock Exchange') ('Admission'). It is expected that settlement of subscriptions in respect of the New Shares and Admission will take place and that trading in the New Shares will commence at 8.00am (London Time) on Friday 28 October. The Tap Issuance is conditional upon, inter alia, Admission becoming effective not later than 8.00am on Friday 28 October (or such later date as Stifel and J.P. Morgan Cazenove may agree with the Company and the Investment Manager) and the Placing Agreement dated 19 October 2016 among the Company, the Investment Manager, Stifel and J.P. Morgan Cazenove (the 'Placing Agreement') becoming unconditional and not being terminated in accordance with its terms. Further details of the Placing Agreement can be found in the terms and conditions of the Tap Issuance set out in the Appendix to this announcement (which forms part of this announcement) (the 'Terms and Conditions'). By choosing to participate in the Tap Issuance and by making an oral and legally binding offer to subscribe for New Shares, investors will be deemed to have read and understood this announcement (including the Appendix), in its entirety and to be making such offer on the terms and subject to the conditions in this announcement, and to be providing the representations, warranties and acknowledgements contained in the Appendix. Your attention is drawn to the detailed Terms and Conditions of the Tap Issuance set out in the Appendix to this announcement. Alex Ohlsson, Chairman of the Company, said, 'The recent upward movements in wholesale power prices have been positive for the sector, and the Company has identified an attractive pipeline of assets that will support the growth of the Company over the next 12 months.  Having secured exclusivity over an 82MW operational portfolio, additional funds raised can be deployed quickly into income generating assets thereby avoiding the impact of cash drag on investors.' Tap Issuance Timetable The timetable is subject to change at the discretion of the Company, Stifel and  J.P. Morgan Cazenove. The decision to allot any New Shares to placees pursuant to the Tap Issuance shall be at the discretion of the Company, Stifel and J.P. Morgan Cazenove. +--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ |Tap Issuance opens |Immediately upon release of this | | |announcement on Wednesday 19 October | | |2016 | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ |Latest time and date for receipt of |01:00pm on Tuesday 25 October 2016 | |Tap Issuance commitments | | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ |Results of Tap Issuance announced and |Wednesday 26 October 2016 | |Trade Date | | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ |Settlement (T+2) |Friday 28 October 2016 | +--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------+ For further information, please contact: Foresight Group Elena Palasmith                epalasmith@foresightgroup.eu                 +44 (0)20 3667 8100 Stifel Nicolaus Europe Limited (Joint Bookrunner) +44 (0)20 7710 7600 Mark Bloomfield Neil Winward Tunga Chigovanyika  J.P.

The New Shares will, when issued, be credited as fully paid and will rank pari passu in all respects with the existing ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (the 'Ordinary Shares'), including the right to receive all dividends and other distributions declared, made or paid in respect of the Ordinary Shares after the date of admission of the New Shares, including the third quarterly dividend of 1.54 pence in respect of the period from 1 July to 30 September 2016, which was approved by the Directors on 18 October 2016 and will be paid on 31 December 2016. Applications for listing and admission to trading Applications will be made to the FCA for admission of the New Shares to the premium listing segment of the Official List of the UK Listing Authority (the 'Official List') and to London Stock Exchange plc (the 'London Stock Exchange') for admission of the New Shares to trading on its main market for listed securities (together, 'Admission'). It is expected that Admission will become effective on or around 8.00 a.m. on Friday 28 October and that dealings in the New Shares will commence at that time. Bookbuild The Joint Bookrunners will today commence the bookbuilding process for participation in the Tap Issuance by Placees (the 'Bookbuild'). This Appendix gives details of the terms and conditions of, and the mechanics of participation in, the Tap Issuance. No commissions will be paid to Placees or by Placees in respect of any New Shares. The Joint Bookrunners shall be entitled to effect the Tap Issuance by such alternative method to the Bookbuild as they may, in their absolute discretion following consultation with the Company and the Investment Manager, determine. Participation in, and principal terms of, the Tap Issuance 1.        Each of Stifel and J.P. Morgan Cazenove is acting as a bookrunner and agent of the Company in connection with the Tap Issuance. 2.        Participation in the Tap Issuance will only be available to persons who may lawfully be, and are, invited to participate by the Joint Bookrunners. The Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates are entitled to enter bids in the Bookbuild as principal. 3.        A single price of 103.00 pence per New Share shall be payable to the Joint Bookrunners as agent for the Company by all Placees whose bids are successful (the 'Placing Price'). The results of the Tap Issuance will be announced on a Regulatory Information Service ('RIS') following the completion of the Bookbuild (the 'Placing Results Announcement'). 4.        To bid in the Bookbuild, prospective Placees should communicate their bid by telephone to their usual sales contact at one of the Joint Bookrunners. Each bid should state the number of New Shares which the prospective Placee wishes to subscribe for at the Placing Price. Bids may be scaled down by the Joint Bookrunners on the basis referred to in paragraph 8 below. 5.        A bid in the Bookbuild will be made on the terms and subject to the conditions in this Appendix and will be legally binding on the Placee on behalf of which it is made and except with the Joint Bookrunners' consent will not be capable of variation or revocation after the time at which it is submitted. Each Placee's obligations will be owed to the Company and the Joint Bookrunners. Each Placee will also have an immediate, separate, irrevocable and binding obligation, owed to the Joint Bookrunners as agents of the Company, to pay in cleared funds immediately on the settlement date, in accordance with the registration and settlement requirements set out below, an amount equal to the product of the Placing Price and the number of New Shares such Placee has agreed to subscribe for and the Company has agreed to allot. 6.        The Bookbuild is expected to close no later than 01:00pm (London time) on Tuesday 25 October 2016, but may be closed earlier or later at the discretion of the Joint Bookrunners. The Joint Bookrunners may, in agreement with the Company and the Investment Manager, accept bids that are received after the Bookbuild has closed. 7.        Each prospective Placee's allocation will be agreed between the Joint Bookrunners (in consultation with the Company and the Investment Manager) and will be confirmed orally by either of the Joint Bookrunners (as agent for the Company) following the close of the Bookbuild and a trade confirmation will be despatched thereafter. This oral confirmation to such Placee will constitute an irrevocable legally binding commitment upon that person (who will at that point become a Placee) in favour of the Bookrunners and the Company to subscribe for the number of New Shares allocated to it at the Placing Price on the terms and conditions set out in this Appendix and in accordance with the Company's articles of association. All obligations under the Bookbuild and Tap Issuance will be subject to fulfilment of the conditions referred to below under 'Conditions of the Tap Issuance' and to the Tap Issuance not being terminated on the basis referred to below under 'Right to terminate under the Placing Agreement'. By participating in the Bookbuild, each Placee will agree that its rights and obligations in respect of the Tap Issuance will terminate only in the circumstances described below and will not be capable of rescission or termination by the Placee. 8.        The Joint Bookrunners may choose to accept bids, either in whole or in part, on the basis of allocations determined in agreement with the Company and may scale down any bids for this purpose on such basis as they may determine. The Joint Bookrunners may also, notwithstanding paragraphs 4 and 5 above and subject to prior consent of the Company (i) allocate New Shares after the time of any initial allocation to any person submitting a bid after that time and (ii) allocate New Shares after the Bookbuild has closed to any person submitting a bid after that time. The Company reserves the right (upon agreement with the Bookrunners) to reduce or seek to increase the amount to be raised pursuant to the Tap Issuance, in its absolute discretion. 9.        Irrespective of the time at which a Placee's allocation pursuant to the Tap Issuance is confirmed, settlement for all New Shares to be subscribed for pursuant to the Tap Issuance will be required to be made at the same time, on the basis explained below under 'Registration and settlement'. 10.      Except as required by law or regulation, no press release or other announcement will be made by the Joint Bookrunners or the Company using the name of any Placee (or its agent), in its capacity as Placee (or agent), other than with such Placee's prior written consent. 11.      To the fullest extent permissible by law, neither of the Joint Bookrunners or any of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees shall have any responsibility or liability to Placees (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise). In particular, neither of the Joint Bookrunners or any of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees shall have any liability (including to the fullest extent permissible by law, any fiduciary duties) in respect of the conduct of the Bookbuild or of such alternative method of effecting the Tap Issuance as the Joint Bookrunners and the Company may agree. Conditions of the Tap Issuance The Tap Issuance is conditional upon the Placing Agreement becoming unconditional and not having been terminated in accordance with its terms. The obligations of the Joint Bookrunners under the Placing Agreement in respect of the New Shares is conditional on, inter alia: (a)      agreement being reached between the Company and the Joint Bookrunners on the number of New Shares to be issued pursuant to the Tap Issuance; (b)      none of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Investment Manager contained in the Placing Agreement being untrue and inaccurate or misleading (in the good faith opinion of the Joint Bookrunners) on the date of the Placing Agreement and at all times before Admission by reference to the facts and circumstances then subsisting, in each case in a manner, or to an extent, which is material; (c)       each of the Company and the Investment Manager complying with its obligations under the Placing Agreement to the extent the same fall to be performed prior to Admission; (d)      the Company allotting, subject only to Admission, the New Shares to the Placees in accordance with the Placing Agreement; and (e)      Admission taking place by not later than 8.00 a.m. (London time) on Friday 28 October 2016. If (i) any of the conditions contained in the Placing Agreement, including those described above, are not fulfilled (or, where permitted, waived or extended in writing by the Joint Bookrunners or have become incapable of fulfilment on or before the date or time specified for the fulfilment thereof (or such later date and/or time as the Joint Bookrunners may agree), or (ii) the Placing Agreement is terminated in the circumstances specified below, the Tap Issuance will not proceed and the Placees' rights and obligations hereunder in relation to the New Shares shall cease and terminate at such time and each Placee agrees that no claim can be made by the Placee in respect thereof. Any such extension or waiver will not affect Placees' commitments as set out in this announcement. Neither of the Joint Bookrunners or any of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees shall have any liability to any Placee (or to any other person whether acting on behalf of a Placee or otherwise) in respect of any decision they may make as to whether or not to waive or to extend the time and/or the date for the satisfaction of any condition to the Tap Issuance nor for any decision they may make as to the satisfaction of any condition or in respect of the Tap Issuance generally, and by participating in the Tap Issuance each Placee agrees that any such decision is within the absolute discretion of the Joint Bookrunners. Right to terminate under the Placing Agreement At any time before Admission, the Joint Bookrunners are entitled to terminate the Placing Agreement by giving notice in writing to the Company and the Investment Manager if, amongst other things, in their opinion (acting in good faith and following consultation with the Company to the extent practicable) (i) any of the Company's or the Investment Manager's warranties or representations contained in the Placing Agreement are not or cease to be true and accurate or have become misleading, in each case in a manner, or to an extent, which is material in the good faith opinion of the Joint Bookrunners; or (ii) there is a material breach by the Company or the Investment Manager of their respective obligations under the Placing Agreement; or (iii) there has been a material adverse change in the condition, financial, operational or otherwise, or in the earnings, management, business affairs, business prospects or financial prospects of the Company and its subsidiaries, or the Investment Manager and its subsidiaries, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, since the date of the Placing Agreement; or (iv) the occurrence of a force majeure or market disruption event as specified in the Placing Agreement which is of such severity or magnitude as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the Tap Issuance or which the Joint Bookrunners consider to be material. Upon such notice being given, the parties to the Placing Agreement shall be released and discharged (except for any liability arising before or in relation to such termination) from their respective obligations under or pursuant to the Placing Agreement, subject to certain exceptions. By participating in the Tap Issuance, Placees agree that the exercise by the Joint Bookrunners of any right of termination or other discretion under the Placing Agreement shall be within their absolute discretion and that they do not need to make any reference to Placees and that the Joint Bookrunners shall not have any liability to Placees whatsoever in connection with any such exercise or failure so to exercise. No Prospectus No offering document or prospectus has been or will be submitted to be approved by the FCA or submitted to the London Stock Exchange in relation to the Tap Issuance and no such prospectus is required (in accordance with the Prospectus Directive) to be published and Placees' commitments will be made solely on the basis of the information contained in this announcement (including this Appendix) released by the Company today and any information publicly announced to a RIS by or on behalf of the Company on or prior to the date of this announcement and subject to the further terms set forth in the contract note to be provided to individual prospective Placees. Each Placee, by accepting a participation in the Tap Issuance, agrees that the content of this announcement (including this Appendix) is exclusively the responsibility of the Company and confirms that it has neither received nor relied on any other information, representation, warranty, or statement made by or on behalf of the Company, the Investment Manager or either of the Joint Bookrunners or any other person and none of the Company, the Investment Manager, either of the Joint Bookrunners or any of their respective affiliates will be liable for any Placee's decision to participate in the Tap Issuance based on any other information, representation, warranty or statement which the Placees may have obtained or received. Each Placee acknowledges and agrees that it has relied on its own investigation of the business, financial or other position of the Company and the Investment Manager in accepting a participation in the Tap Issuance. Nothing in this paragraph shall exclude or limit the liability of any person for fraudulent misrepresentation by that person. Registration and settlement Settlement of transactions in the New Shares following Admission will take place within the system administered by Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited ('CREST'), subject to certain exceptions. The Joint Bookrunners and the Company reserve the right to require settlement for and delivery of the New Shares (or a portion thereof) to Placees in certificated form if delivery or settlement is not possible or practicable within the CREST system or would not be consistent with the regulatory requirements in the Placee's jurisdiction. Following the close of the Bookbuild for the Tap Issuance, each Placee allocated New Shares in the Tap Issuance will be sent a contract note stating the number of New Shares to be allocated to it at the Placing Price and settlement instructions. Each Placee agrees that it will do all things necessary to ensure that delivery and payment is completed in accordance with the standing CREST or certificated settlement instructions that it has in place with the Joint Bookrunners. The Company will deliver the New Shares to a CREST account operated by Stifel as the Company's agent and Friday 28 October 2016 will enter its delivery (DEL) instruction into the CREST system. The input to CREST by a Placee of a matching or acceptance instruction will then allow delivery of the relevant New Shares to that Placee against payment. It is expected that settlement will be on 28 October 2016 on a delivery versus payment basis in accordance with the instructions set out in the trade confirmation. Interest is chargeable daily on payments not received from Placees on the due date in accordance with the arrangements set out above at the rate of two percentage points above LIBOR as determined by the Joint Bookrunners. Each Placee is deemed to agree that, if it does not comply with these obligations, the Joint Bookrunners (as agent for the Company) may sell any or all of the New Shares allocated to that Placee on such Placee's behalf and retain from the proceeds, for the Company's account and benefit, an amount equal to the aggregate amount owed by the Placee plus any interest due. The relevant Placee will, however, remain liable for any shortfall below the aggregate amount owed by it and may be required to bear any stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax (together with any interest or penalties) or other similar taxes imposed in any jurisdiction which may arise upon the sale of such New Shares on such Placee's behalf. If New Shares are to be delivered to a custodian or settlement agent, Placees should ensure that the trade confirmation is copied and delivered immediately to the relevant person within that organisation. Insofar as New Shares are registered in a Placee's name or that of its nominee or in the name of any person for whom a Placee is contracting as agent or that of a nominee for such person, such New Shares should, subject as provided below, be so registered free from any liability to UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax. Placees shall not be entitled to receive any fee or commission in connection with the Tap Issuance. Representations and warranties and further terms By participating in the Tap Issuance, each Placee (and any person acting on such Placee's behalf) irrevocably acknowledges, confirms, undertakes, represents, warrants and agrees (as the case may be) with each of the Joint Bookrunners (in its capacity as a bookrunner and agent of the Company, in each case as a fundamental term of its application for New Shares), the following: (a)      it has read and understood this announcement, including this Appendix, in its entirety and that its acquisition of New Shares is subject to and based upon all the terms, conditions, representations, warranties, acknowledgements, agreements and undertakings and other information contained herein and undertakes not to redistribute or duplicate this announcement; (b)      that no offering document or prospectus has been or will be prepared in connection with the Tap Issuance and it has not received and will not receive a prospectus or other offering document in connection with the Bookbuild, the Tap Issuance or the New Shares; (c)       the Tap Issuance does not constitute a recommendation or financial product advice and no Joint Bookrunner has had regard to its particular objectives, financial situation and needs; (d)      that the Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company are listed on the premium listing segment of the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and admitted to trading on the main market of the London Stock Exchange, and that the Company is therefore required to publish certain business and financial information in accordance with the rules and practices of the FCA and that it is able to obtain or access such information, or comparable information concerning any other publicly traded company, in each case without undue difficulty; (e)      that none of the Company, the Investment Manager the Joint Bookrunners any of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees or any person acting on behalf of any of them has provided, and none of them will provide, it with any material regarding the New Shares or the Company or any other person other than this announcement, nor has it requested either of the Joint Bookrunners, the Company, the Investment Manager, any of their respective affiliates or any person acting on behalf of any of them to provide it with any such information; (f)       unless otherwise specifically agreed with the Joint Bookrunners, that it is not, and at the time the New Shares are subscribed for, neither it nor the beneficial owner of the New Shares will be, a resident of Australia, Canada, Japan or South Africa and further acknowledges that the New Shares have not been and will not be registered under the securities legislation of Australia, Canada, Japan or South Africa and, subject to certain exceptions, may not be offered, sold, transferred, delivered or distributed, directly or indirectly, in or into those jurisdictions; (g)      that it is not within the United States and will not be within the United States at the time that any buy order for New Shares is originated by it; (ii) is acquiring the New Shares in an 'offshore transaction' as defined in Regulation S under the US Securities Act; and (iii) is not acquiring any of the New Shares as a result of any form of 'directed selling efforts' (within the meaning of Regulation S under the US Securities Act); (h)      it is not within Australia, Canada, Japan South Africa or any other jurisdiction in which it is unlawful to make or accept an offer to subscribe for the New Shares, and it will not offer or sell such New Shares into any such jurisdiction; (i)       that the content of this announcement is exclusively the responsibility of the Company and that neither of the Joint Bookrunners or any of their respective affiliates, agents, directors, officers or employees or any person acting on behalf of any of them has or shall have any liability for any information, representation or statement contained in this announcement or any information previously or subsequently published by or on behalf of the Company or the Investment Manager, including, without limitation, any information required to be published by the Company pursuant to applicable laws (the 'Exchange Information') and will not be liable for any Placee's decision to participate in the Tap Issuance based on any information, representation or statement contained in this announcement or otherwise. Each Placee further represents, warrants and agrees that the only information on which it is entitled to rely and on which such Placee has relied in committing itself to subscribe for the New Shares is contained in this announcement and any information previously published by the Company by notification to a RIS, such information being all that it deems necessary to make an investment decision in respect of the New Shares and that it has neither received nor relied on any other information given or representations, warranties or statements made by either of the Joint Bookrunners, the Investment Manager or the Company and neither of the Joint Bookrunners, the Investment Manager or the Company will be liable for any Placee's decision to accept an invitation to participate in the Tap Issuance based on any other information, representation, warranty or statement. Each Placee further acknowledges and agrees that it has relied on its own investigation of the business, financial or other position of the Company in deciding to participate in the Tap Issuance. None of the Company, the Investment Manager, the Joint Bookrunners or any of their respective affiliates has made any representations to it, express or implied, with respect to the Company, the Investment Manager, the Tap Issuance and the New Shares or the accuracy, completeness or adequacy of the Exchange Information, and each of them expressly disclaims any liability in respect thereof.

and (ii) it is and will remain liable to the Company and/or the Joint Bookrunners for the performance of all its obligations as a Placee in respect of the Tap Issuance (regardless of the fact that it is acting for another person); (l)       if a financial intermediary, as that term is used in Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive, that the New Shares subscribed for by it in the Tap Issuance will not be subscribed for on a non-discretionary basis on behalf of, nor will they be subscribed for with a view to their offer or resale to, persons in a member state of the EEA other than Qualified Investors, or in circumstances in which the prior consent of the Joint Bookrunners has been given to the proposed offer or resale; (m)     that it has not offered or sold and will not offer or sell any New Shares to the public in any member state of the EEA except in circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive which do not result in any requirement for the publication of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of that Directive;

It further confirms that it relied on its own examination and due diligence of the Investment Manager, the Company and their respective associates taken as a whole, and the terms of the Tap Issuance, including the merits and risks involved, and not upon any view expressed or information provided by or on behalf of either of the Joint Bookrunners; (z)       that in connection with the Tap Issuance, a Joint Bookrunner and any of its affiliates acting as an investor for its own account may take up New Shares in the Company and in that capacity may subscribe for, retain, purchase or sell for its own account such Ordinary Shares in the Company and any securities of the Company or related investments and may offer or sell such securities or other investments otherwise than in connection with the Tap Issuance. Neither of the Joint Bookrunners intends to disclose the extent of any such investment or transactions otherwise than in accordance with any legal or regulatory obligation to do so; (aa)         that in making any decision to subscribe for the New Shares, it acknowledges that the Company has been established in Jersey as a listed fund under a fast-track authorisation process and is therefore only suitable for professional or experienced investors, or those who have taken appropriate professional advice. It further acknowledges that regulatory requirements which may be deemed necessary for the protection of retail or inexperienced investors, do not apply to listed funds and it accepts the reduced requirements accordingly; (bb)       that in making any decision to subscribe for the New Shares, it is responsible for ensuring that all aspects of the Company are acceptable to it. It further acknowledges that investment in listed funds may involve special risks that could lead to a loss of all or a substantial portion of such investment.  It further confirms that it fully understands and accepts the nature of the Company and the potential risks inherent in investing in the Company; (cc)     that these terms and conditions and any agreements entered into by it pursuant to these terms and conditions and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with such agreements shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales and it submits (on behalf of itself and on behalf of any person on whose behalf it is acting) to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts as regards any claim, dispute or matter arising out of any such contract, except that enforcement proceedings in respect of the obligation to make payment for the New Shares (together with any interest chargeable thereon) may be taken by the Company or either of the Joint Bookrunners in any jurisdiction in which the relevant Placee is incorporated or in which any of its securities have a quotation on a recognised stock exchange; (dd)    that the Company, the Investment Manager, each of the Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of the representations, warranties and acknowledgements set forth herein and which are given to each Joint Bookrunner on its own behalf and on behalf of the Company and are irrevocable and it irrevocably authorises the Company and each of the Joint Bookrunners to produce this announcement, pursuant to, in connection with, or as may be required by any applicable law or regulation, administrative or legal proceeding or official inquiry with respect to the matters set forth herein; (ee)    that it will indemnify on an after-tax basis and hold the Company, the Investment Manager, each of the Joint Bookrunners and their respective affiliates harmless from any and all costs, claims, liabilities and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) arising out of or in connection with any breach of the representations, warranties, acknowledgements, agreements and undertakings in this Appendix and further agrees that the provisions of this Appendix shall survive after completion of the Tap Issuance; (ff)      that it has neither received nor relied on any inside information concerning the Company in accepting the invitation to participate in the Tap Issuance; and (gg)     if it is a pension fund or investment company, its acquisition of New Shares is in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The foregoing representations, warranties and confirmations are given for the benefit of the Company, the Investment Manager and the Joint Bookrunners and are irrevocable. Each Placee, and any person acting on behalf of the Placee, acknowledges that none of the Company, the Investment Manager or either of the Joint Bookrunners owes any fiduciary or other duties to any Placee in respect of any representations, warranties, undertakings or indemnities in the Placing Agreement. By participating in the Tap Issuance, each Placee (and any person acting on the Placee's behalf) subscribing for New Shares acknowledges that the New Shares have not been and will not be registered under the US Securities Act and that the New Shares are being offered and sold only in an 'offshore transaction' within the meaning of and in reliance on Regulation S under the US Securities Act. Please also note that the agreement to allot and issue New Shares to Placees (or the persons for whom Placees are contracting as agent) free of stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax relates only to their allotment and issue to Placees, or such persons as they nominate as their agents, direct from the Company for the New Shares in question. Such agreement also assumes that the New Shares are not being subscribed for in connection with arrangements to issue depositary receipts or to issue or transfer the New Shares into a clearance service. If there are any such arrangements, or the settlement relates to any other dealing in the New Shares, stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax or other similar taxes may be payable, for which none of the Company, the Investment Manager or either of the Joint Bookrunners will be responsible and the Placees shall indemnify the Company, the Investment Manager and each of the Joint Bookrunners on an after- tax basis for any stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax paid by them in respect of any such arrangements or dealings. If this is the case, each Placee should seek its own advice and notify the Joint Bookrunners accordingly. None of the Company, the Investment Manager or either of the Joint Bookrunners are liable to bear any transfer taxes that arise on a sale of New Shares subsequent to their acquisition by Placees or for transfer taxes arising otherwise than under the laws of the United Kingdom. Each Placee should, therefore, take its own advice as to whether any such transfer tax liability arises and notify the Joint Bookrunners accordingly. Furthermore, each Placee agrees to indemnify on an after-tax basis and hold each Joint Bookrunner, the Investment Manager and/or the Company and their respective affiliates harmless from any and all interest, fines or penalties in relation to stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax and all other similar duties or taxes to the extent that such interest, fines or penalties arise from the unreasonable default or delay of that Placee or its agent. Each Placee and any person acting on behalf of each Placee acknowledges and agrees that the Joint Bookrunners or any of their respective affiliates may, at their absolute discretion, agree to become a Placee in respect of some or all of the New Shares. When a Placee or person acting on behalf of the Placee is dealing with the Joint Bookrunners, any money held in an account with any Joint Bookrunner on behalf of the Placee and/or any person acting on behalf of the Placee will not be treated as client money within the meaning of the rules and regulations of the FCA made under FSMA. The Placee acknowledges that the money will not be subject to the protections conferred by the client money rules; as a consequence, this money will not be segregated from such Joint Bookrunner's money in accordance with the client money rules and will be used by that Joint Bookrunner in the course of its own business; and the Placee will rank only as a general creditor of that Joint Bookrunner. All times and dates in this announcement may be subject to amendment by the Joint Bookrunners (in their absolute discretion). The Joint Bookrunners shall notify the Placees and any person acting on behalf of the Placees of any changes.

With the decline, GE is trading around the same level it was in October 2015, after Peltz’s Trian Fund Management LP announced it had taken a $2.5 billion stake. The S&P 500 Index is up about 5 percent in that same span. Nelson Peltz Photographer: Kevin Lorenzi/Bloomberg “You have earnings risk, high expectations and weak underlying free cash flow, which to me is a pretty bad formula for a stock,” said Steve Tusa, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. who in May cut his rating on GE to underweight. “What you have is a good franchise where people expect too much out of it.” GE rallied last year as Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt led a major transformation, shedding finance units and completing GE’s largest-ever industrial acquisition to reorient the business around energy, aviation and oil. While the company has continued to evolve, with an increasing focus on software, GE hasn’t been able to sustain the enthusiasm through 2016. Tougher Task When it reports third-quarter earnings this week, the Boston-based company will look to regain momentum and show investors that it can overcome a weak first half and persistently sluggish economy to deliver on growth expectations. That task became tougher after Honeywell International Inc. and Dover Corp. spooked industrial investors this month by trimming 2016 earnings forecasts. “They both cited some general industrial slowing, so that has made everyone nervous about the industrials,” said Deane Dray, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets who rates GE outperform. “If you feel like the macro is getting tougher, then that’s going to be a tough environment for investors.” Trian -- which was co-founded by Peltz, 74, along with Peter May and Ed Garden -- last year revealed it held a roughly 1 percent stake in GE. The activist firm, which had been quietly buying shares for several months as GE traded in the mid-$20s, has taken a friendly and largely hands-off approach to the investment. The move, seen as an endorsement of GE’s transformation strategy, generated a pop in the shares to almost $30 within two weeks. At the time, Trian said the stock, including dividends, could reach $45 a share by the end of 2017. GE rose 0.7 percent to $29.19 at 12:43 p.m. in New York, up less than 1 percent from a year ago. The shares climbed as high as $32.93 a share in 2016, but they’ve slid since July, when the company reported an orders decline that jeopardized its ability to hit aggressive growth targets. ‘Best’ Assets Peltz on Wednesday defended the investment, saying in a CNBC interview that GE has the “best set of industrial assets on the planet” and that he’s not concerned about the prospect of a bad quarter. Trian planned to stay with GE for “a long time,” he said. The firm declined to comment for this article. GE has maintained its forecast of 2 percent to 4 percent organic growth for the year even as that metric fell 1 percent through the first six months and has remained weak across other industrial companies. Hitting the goal would require second-half growth of 5 percent, a target that “may be optimistic,” Karen Ubelhart, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note. GE executives have said 2016 will be heavily weighted to late in the year, with gas-turbine shipments boosting earnings in the fourth quarter. GE declined to comment further. Analysts have cut expectations for third-quarter adjusted earnings by about 2 cents in the past four weeks to 30 cents a share, according to an average of 15 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The persistent lowering of expectations will make better-than-forecast earnings less meaningful, particularly if orders and free cash flow remain weak, said Tusa of JPMorgan. “It is a back end-loaded year, but it is a back end-loaded year that has undoubtedly, on an operating basis, been worse than expected,” said Tusa, whose price target is $28. As a result, investors are also questioning whether GE can achieve its earnings-per-share target of $2 in 2018, he said. Software Business Dray of RBC called the $2 forecast achievable if GE can make progress in the coming quarters on several fronts, including integrating assets acquired last year from Alstom SA and keeping the oil-and-gas division from falling more sharply than expected. GE’s prospects could depend less on near-term results and more on the ability to differentiate itself through its software business, according to Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at William Blair & Co. Lack of growth in the industrial sector has made such efforts critical, he said, and GE is making progress with its Predix operating system and efforts to expand the GE Digital division. “This need to digitize to create customer and shareholder value is no longer optional and will require structural changes in the way industrial manufacturers create value,” Heymann, who rates GE outperform with a target of $38 a share, said in an Oct. 14 note. “GE is the vanguard of digitally enabled diversified industrials.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Joshua Lott/File PhotoMore By Richa Naidu and Dan Freed (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp , the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, reported its first profit increase in three quarters on Monday, foiling expectations for another drop, as bond trading surged and expenses fell. Like rivals JPMorgan and Citigroup , Bank of America enjoyed a boost from a resurgence in trading. That came as clients scrambled to reposition after Britain's surprise June vote to leave the European Union, and changing expectations for monetary policy in the United States, Europe and Japan. Chief Executive Brian Moynihan's cost-cutting campaign also paid off as expenses fell in each of its four major business segments. On a pretax basis, quarterly profit was at its highest in a decade. Net income attributable to shareholders rose 6.6 percent to $4.45 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from a year ago. Earnings per share rose to 41 cents, from 38 cents in the same period of 2015. Analysts, on average, had estimated a decline to 34 cents a share. Revenue grew 3 percent to $21.64 billion, beating the $20.97 billion expected by analysts. Net profit in Bank of America's trading-focused Global Markets arm jumped 34 percent from a year earlier as revenue from dealing fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities surged 39 percent. Equity trading revenue fell 17 percent. Last week, JPMorgan reported a 48 percent increase in bond trading and Citi posted a 35 percent gain. Trading in stocks rose 1 percent and fell 34 percent respectively at JPMorgan and Citi. Like Bank of America, JMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo beat third-quarter profit and revenue forecasts but their net earnings declined; JPMorgan Chase & Co's by 7.6 percent, Citigroup Inc's by 10.5 percent and Wells Fargo & Co's by 3.7 percent. Shares of Bank of America were little changed, up 0.15 percent in afternoon trading. Ahead of Monday, the stock had shed 4.9 percent since the start of the year, compared to a 2.5 percent decline in the KBW banking index <.BKX>. DUAL ROLES After scandal-ridden Wells Fargo & Co separated its chief executive and chairman roles last week with the retirement of John Stumpf, Moynihan was asked during a conference call on Monday whether he expected renewed pressure to give up his dual role from regulators or shareholders. "Our lead independent director duty is as strong as anybody's in the industry," said Moynihan, who had faced down a shareholder vote last year over whether to split the roles. He added that he felt "comfortable" with the bank's current governance. Bank of America's large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities make it particularly dependent on a rise in interest rates to boost profits. To compensate for stubbornly low interest rates, Moynihan made trimming costs a top priority, saying in July he would cut annual expenses by another $5 billion by 2018, which would take the total to about $53 billion from about $58 billion in 2015. In the third quarter, non-interest expenses fell 3.3 percent to $13.48 billion as headcount fell by 3 percent. Like rivals, Bank of America got a boost from a rise in the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, a benchmark for more than $300 trillion worth of financial products worldwide. Libor moved to a seven-year high during the third quarter as U.S. money market funds scaled back holdings in short-term bank debt in advance of new regulations. Bank of America's net interest income rose 3 percent to $10.20 billion, the first increase in three quarters. Like JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, BofA set aside more money to cover potential bad loans. The bank's provisions rose 5.5 percent to $850 million in the quarter. Income from investment banking rose 13.3 percent to $1.46 billion, driven by higher debt and equity issuance activity. Revenue for advising on deals tumbled 19 percent as companies held off making acquisitions amid political uncertainty in the United States and Brexit-related volatility in Britain. Adjusted revenue from Bank of America's wealth and investment management unit, which includes Merrill Lynch, fell 1.7 percent to $4.38 billion, but a 6 percent drop in non-interest expenses helped to boost net income by 10 percent. The wealth business, which has been a stable source of revenue growth when trading and investment banking revenues have fluctuated, is undergoing its own changes, with a new boss, longtime executive Andy Sieg, expected to take over in 2017 and amid a regulatory overhaul of financial advice in the United States.

CDT October 20, 2016 Mayor Sylvester Turner announced Thursday that JPMorgan Chase & Co. donated $1 million to a program that directly funds new apartments for chronically homeless people. (Photo: KHOU) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Mayor Sylvester Turner announced Thursday that JPMorgan Chase & Co. donated $1 million to a program that directly funds new apartments for chronically homeless people. The money will support Houston’s ambitious efforts to end chronic homelessness through The Way Home, the Houston region’s nationally recognized homeless housing initiative. A formerly homeless man, Jay Jeanjaquet, spoke at the event about how the program has helped him get his life back. After two tours in Korea, Jeanjaquet told KHOU medical problems cost him his job. “I kissed the ground when I got back," he said. It wasn’t long before Jeanjaquet's life spiraled out of control. He became suicidal and wore his welcome out with his family. “Rejection from family because of what happened. My situation,” Jeanjacquet explained. He found himself on the streets of Houston, down and out and nowhere to go. “Pretty lonely. It was kind of catastrophic, to be honest with you," Jeanjaquet said. He spent five years in the shadows before help found him. He’s no longer standing on a street corner, but at a podium Thursday, next to Mayor Turner. “I wish I could elaborate on all the people that helped me get here today,” Jeanjaquet said. More than 100 agencies are working with the City of Houston to build housing like the Temenos Place Apartments 2 at 2200 Jefferson, in east downtown Houston, to get people off the street. “It’s not enough to fill potholes in the street if we don’t take opportunity to fill potholes in people’s lives," Turner said. The The Way Home program has transitioned people like Jeanjaquet and more than 8,000 chronically homeless people to permanent homes. “I get up. I exercise. I visit friends. I consider myself retired,” Jeanjaquet said about his new life. It’s more than just a roof over someone’s head. “I have improved. I’m actually going somewhere in my life right now,” he said. According to the City of Houston, The Way Home has raised $7 million toward it’s $15 million goal to finish creating 2,500 units of housing for chronically homeless individuals.

Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. grabbed a bigger share of the market last quarter by forcing hedge funds hungry for financing to send more stock-trading business their way. The three firms booked $5.1 billion from equities in the third quarter, or 76 percent of the total posted by the five largest U.S. investment banks, according to their financial statements. That was the most for the period since 2012. Regulations put in place since the financial crisis help explain why. A new rule intended to make banks safer and avoid government bailouts forced lenders to fund less risky assets with more equity, reducing returns. As a result, some companies left the business and the ones left standing are raising prices. “The firms can now tell their clients that want access to the balance sheet, ‘I have to make sure I get paid enough,’” Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Autonomous Research, said in an interview. That may mean demanding a richer spread on lending, or insisting on “more market share of a customers’ business flow,” he said. Hedge funds, in many cases, are in no position to argue. Average annual returns over the past three years were just 2 percent, spurring investor withdrawals. Under pressure to cut costs, funds are acquiescing to banks’ insistence that they concentrate their business in exchange for the best service available. The trend helped Morgan Stanley hold its No. 1 ranking among prime brokerages for the largest global hedge funds, followed by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, according to a 2016 survey conducted by Global Custodian, which follows the international securities-services industry. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. ranked seventh and 10th, respectively. Spreading Wealth “In environments where clients have limited fees to spread around, they probably want to spread it around to the people they think are the biggest and the best, and we are that,” Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said Wednesday in an interview. Daniel Pinto, head of JPMorgan’s corporate and investment bank, highlighted the firm’s progress in equities and prime brokerage Thursday in a town hall meeting in Manhattan for traders and investment bankers. Amid the industry’s declining stock-trading fees this year, the bank has managed to retain more revenue than competitors, he said. Equity-trading revenue declined at Citigroup and Bank of America enough to cut the total amount earned by the five biggest U.S. investment banks by 4.8 percent to $6.7 billion, compared with the year-earlier quarter. Bank of America, where revenue fell 17 percent, blamed lower volume in cash equities and derivatives. Morgan Stanley, with a 6.4 percent increase, cited derivatives as a source of strength. Bank of America equities head Fabrizio Gallo is still in the process of shifting away from an emphasis on cash equities, Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan said Thursday during a Bloomberg TV interview. “The heritage of the company was much more of a cash-based equity business, and he’s had to move to a more electronics-based and derivatives-based business,” Moynihan said. Citigroup was challenged despite making equities trading, and hedge fund services specifically, a key focus for growth. The bank has upgraded its technology systems, hired senior managers and earmarked more of its balance sheet for the business. Wallet Share “We’ve made the right investments in people, the right investments in technology, and now it’s up to us to gain as much of our clients’ wallet shares as we can,” Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said on a call with journalists Friday. “When you are the No. 8 or the No. 9 player and the overall market volume, as I’ve said, is down, that means that most clients are going to stay with their No. 1 or No. 2 current providers, and it’s a little more difficult to break in.” The battle among the dealers is a sign of a larger trend, according to Morgan Stanley’s Pruzan. While the CFO didn’t single out Morgan Stanley’s prime brokerage when Moszkowski asked about its contribution on a conference call Wednesday, he acknowledged how pressures are reshaping the industry. “You’re going to see -- just like in many other financial-services products -- the concentration of market share among the top players,” Pruzan said. “That’s what you’re seeing in equities.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(AP/Mark Lennihan) Share Written by Eshe Nelson October 20, 2016 Investment banking is back! After a rocky few years, to say the least, major Wall Street banks are once again making huge amounts of money from bond trading, a traditional cash cow. In the third quarter, revenue from trading in fixed-income securities and similar products was up at least 30% year-over-year at each of the biggest US investment banks. JPMorgan, for example, recorded a 48% increase in bond-trading revenue, to $4.3 billion, in the quarter. But you won’t see the banks celebrating this too much. Instead, bank bosses have taken a self-deprecating tone when discussing their buoyant bond-trading businesses. Mostly, they say the recent jump was flattered by comparisons with weak results in the same period last year. Here is how some of bank execs explained why they just couldn’t help making so much money: Harvey Mitchell Schwartz, CFO of Goldman Sachs “I would say maybe the best way to describe it, it wasn’t so much about tailwinds as it was about not having so many headwinds in the quarter. And of course, it translated nicely for us.” Marianne Lake, CFO of JPMorgan “When you think about the year-over-year comparison, we are a little flattered by last year’s performance, not necessarily more so than our peers, but nevertheless we are.” James Gorman, CEO of Morgan Stanley “It was a better macro environment. There was more volatility post-Brexit. There was more volatility around rates… and the credit markets firmed up. So if you’re in the fixed income business, you were going to have a better quarter. We’re in it and we had a better quarter.” For good measure, Gorman of Morgan Stanley said the thing he was “pleased” about was that the bank’s performance came “with 25% less people.” That may be harsh, but it acknowledges the wrenching restructuring investment banks have undertaken in recent years, mainly by cutting staff and shrinking their balance sheets. Despite their strong results, you can understand why the big banks don’t want to gloat. After their industry imperiled the global economy in 2008, soaking up trillions in taxpayer bailouts in the aftermath, banks aren’t as keen as they once were to highlight their money-making prowess. And so investment bankers—the ones that are left, anyway—are keeping their heads down. Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

Advertisement More stories                Tools Increase Text Decrease Text Reset Text Print Article UBS employees work in the UBS ‘fintech lab’ at Canary Wharf in London October 19, 2016. — Reuters picLONDON, Oct 20 — The blockchain technology behind bitcoin was designed to do away with banks. In an ironic reverse, investment banks are now racing to make it work for them — but cash-strapped European players risk falling behind their Wall Street rivals. Blockchain was developed eight years ago, enabling transactions using the digital currency to be processed and settled on a public network without the need for a third party. Now banks are seeking to apply it to private networks they run, to save costs by reducing settlement times and automating systems that are still paper-based, like in trade finance. About 80 per cent of top global banks will have launched blockchain projects by next year, the World Economic Forum (WEF) said in August, describing the technology as the future “beating heart” of the financial sector. A survey of 200 top global banks by tech firm IBM last month found that 15 per cent will have rolled out commercial blockchain products by the end of 2017. But there is likely to be a transatlantic imbalance in bringing out such products, given the costs involved in developing new technology. While US investment banks moved quickly to restructure and recapitalise after the financial crisis, European players are still struggling with cost-cutting and shoring up their balance sheets. Dozens of patent applications have been filed in total by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America for blockchain-based products, but there is a record of only one being filed by a European bank — Switzerland’s UBS. “The European banks are cost-focused, whereas US banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are likely trying to generate revenue, because they’re in different market conditions,” said Simon Taylor, who was in charge of blockchain product development at Barclays for two years until he left in June to co-found London fintech consultancy 11:FS. “Reading between the lines, that says: ‘we want to profit from this, we want to build the thing’,” he said of American banks. Taylor said that dynamic was playing out not just in terms of the amounts of investment in blockchain projects, but also in how US banks are seeking to develop their own products while European banks are taking a more collaborative and less aggressive approach. No leading bank has publicly said how much it has invested in blockchain. The six global banks approached by Reuters for this story – in the United States and Europe – declined to say how much they had spent. The WEF estimates a total of about US$1.5 billion has been invested in blockchain by all industries, including financial institutions and tech companies. ‘Columbus mission’ The UBS “fintech lab” on the 42nd floor of One Canada Square tower in London’s Canary Wharf financial district does not look much like a bank office. Ideas are scrawled onto walls in pen and Post-It notes adorn a see-through dividing panel. UBS is regarded in the industry as one of the most innovative European banks. It radically restructured its investment banking arm in 2012 – earlier than most of its European competitors – to focus more on wealth management, but it faces the same cost-cutting pressures. “There’s constant pressure to deliver,” said the bank’s blockchain lead Alex Batlin, who is leaving for BNY Mellon — which until recently has not appeared very active in its work on the technology but now seems to be on a spending spree, recently advertising 37 open positions on Blocktribe.com, a website dedicated to blockchain jobs. “I always saw this as a Columbus mission — we go out and look for gold, we don’t know what’s going to happen, but if we do discover something it could be massive and therefore it’s worth investing in,” Batlin said, adding that he was always careful to deliver “shareholder value”. Banks are investing in blockchain in different ways: some invest directly in start-ups or have “incubator” programmes where they work with start-up staff, others — like UBS — have “labs” in which they experiment with the technology. Some take all of these approaches. They are also working together on the technology in consortia in order to come up with common standards and systems, with the most notable of these being New York-based R3, which includes most of the world’s biggest banks. Adam Ludwin, CEO of Chain, a San-Francisco-based blockchain start-up that is working with firms like Citi and Nasdaq, said it would be foolish for banks to spend too much at this point, as the technology was still in an experimentation phase. “You could spend tens of millions but you’d probably be doing it wrong if you were spending hundreds of millions right now,” he said. “The nature of new innovation and software development is that you invest incrementally.” In the game In Reuters interviews about tech innovation with banks, blockchain consortia and consultancies, the name of one US investment bank came up more often than any other: Goldman Sachs, which posted a 58 per cent jump in third-quarter profits on Tuesday. The bank, which has a history of developing new platforms internally that it then sells to the marketplace, as well as investing in start-ups, recently filed a patent application for a platform for trading foreign exchange via blockchain. “There are some banks — Goldman Sachs being the epitome of this — that... recognise the future of banking as being more and more a question of technology,” said Charley Cooper, managing director of the R3 blockchain consortium. But while they might be held back by cost pressures, Europe’s lenders are trying to keep up with their US peers on the tech front. Earlier this month when Dutch bank ING announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs, it also said it would invest 800 million euros in its technology platform. As Deutsche Bank’s share price was sliding towards a 30-year low last month on concerns over a fine from the US Department of Justice, it announced that its new “digital factory” would be staffed by 800 specialists by 2018. “We’re advising our clients that they would be frankly foolish not to be experimenting (in blockchain technology),” said Deloitte global financial services industry leader Bob Contri. “If you’re not in the game and if you’re not experimenting then you’re falling behind.” — Reuters                 MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Nepal PM phones India’s Modi over rupee chaos Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to ‘fake’ news sites European equities drift higher United to delay taking Boeing jets in US$4.8b savings push Snapchat files for one of the biggest tech IPOs in years, sources say Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter Most Watched Now Week An in-depth look at Mazda’s SKYACTIV-G engine Reuters Video: Groin-flashing frog discovered in Australia Reuters Video: Supermoon dazzles in Havana Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Related Articles Bitcoin?

The U.S. bank is in talks to sell its stake in JPMorgan First Capital Securities as it seeks to free itself up to get more control in a potential new venture, according to a statement on Thursday and people familiar with the matter. Since UBS Group AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. established Chinese joint ventures more than a decade ago, foreign banks have struggled to challenge local players. One competitive disadvantage is that Chinese rules limit them to minority stakes, reducing their sway over key decisions. JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon’s decision signals that some banks are growing frustrated with the hurdles in China. Mark Schwartz, the Goldman Sachs veteran who oversaw efforts to secure full control of the firm’s local investment-banking venture, is stepping down as Asia-Pacific chairman, according to a memo this week. “Having a minority stake in a China joint venture is no longer attractive because their role is rather passive and they only have limited participation,” Wong Chi Man, a Hong Kong-based analyst at China Galaxy Securities Co., said by phone. “I wouldn’t be surprised if other foreign firms follow suit.” ‘Fully Committed’ JPMorgan’s local partner, First Capital Securities Co., said it was in talks to buy the U.S. firm’s stake. In a separate release, JPMorgan said that it “remains fully committed to our China franchise.” JPMorgan First Capital Securities generated 156 million yuan ($23 million) of revenue in the first half, less than a third of what Citigroup Inc.’s joint venture pulled in, according to reports from their Chinese partners. Globally, JPMorgan had almost $25 billion of revenue in the most recent quarter, Bloomberg-compiled data show. One option JPMorgan is weighing is forming a new joint venture under a framework established in the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, the people said. That framework opens the door for overseas banks to achieve greater control of local ventures and pick partners that aren’t in the securities business, they said. Even so, the rules have yet to be finalized, according to the people. HSBC Holdings Plc, which stayed on the sidelines for years as other banks set up minority-owned JVs, is attempting a setup with control. It plans a majority-owned venture in the free-trade zone of Qianhai and is in the process of seeking approval from China’s securities regulator, in what CEO Stuart Gulliver says would be a first for a foreign bank. HSBC’s Asian banking unit is incorporated in Hong Kong, allowing the company to apply for such a venture under the city’s Closer Economic Partnership Agreement with China. Its partner is state-owned Shenzhen Qianhai Financial Holdings Co. Patchy History JPMorgan’s businesses in China include corporate banking and stakes in a fund manager and in a commodities futures joint venture, according to the bank’s China website. It holds a one-third stake in the Beijing-based investment banking joint venture, whose business includes equity and debt underwriting and mergers advisory. While tying up with a local firm is a prerequisite for investment banking in China, collaborations haven’t always worked out. BNP Paribas SA pulled out of a venture with Changjiang Securities Co. in 2007 after disagreeing on strategy, while Morgan Stanley exited from China International Capital Corp. -- the first Sino-foreign brokerage venture -- in 2010. Morgan Stanley opted instead to form a partnership with a Shenzhen-based company. Most foreign-backed joint ventures are minnows in China. JPMorgan First Capital ranked 120th out of China’s 125 securities firms by net income in 2015, according to the Securities Association of China. UBS Securities Co. whose 296 million yuan profit was the biggest among foreign-backed joint ventures, came in at 95th place. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

REUTERS/Dylan Martinez/FilesMore By Sumeet Chatterjee and Julie Zhu HONG KONG (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co is in talks to sell out of a Chinese securities joint venture with First Capital Securities Co Ltd in what would be the first departure by a top-tier global investment bank from China's securities segment. Wall Street banks like JPMorgan hold only minority stakes in such ventures. The resulting lack of control and limited contribution to total revenue have brought banks frustration at a time when domestic competition has become acute. Almost all leading investment banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, UBS Group AG, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG have securities ventures with local firms. Shenzhen-listed broker First Capital, in an exchange filing on Thursday, said it is in talks to buy JPMorgan's 33 percent of JP Morgan First Capital Securities Co. It said no transaction has been finalised and that any purchase remains uncertain. JPMorgan confirmed the content of the filing. "China is a key market for the firm globally and for many of our clients outside China. J.P. Morgan believes in the long term prospects of China and remains fully committed to our China franchise," the U.S. bank said in an emailed statement. Neither JPMorgan nor First Capital gave reasons for the move. Some analysts said the U.S. bank could return to China's securities market with a new partner as the outlook for onshore deals remains attractive. Rival Morgan Stanley launched a securities joint venture with Huaxin Securities in 2011, a year after it sold its 34.3 percent of China International Capital Corp Ltd (CICC), the country's top investment bank at the time. "It has been a difficult ride (for foreign banks), but we really feel that it's at tipping point in terms of opportunities and the banks have just a lot left on the table," said Benjamin Quinlan, CEO of financial services consultancy Quinlan & Associates. "There is no alternative avenue for foreign players to go in and China is sending a clear signal that it is liberalising and I do think they (foreign banks) will be able to get to a stage where they have effective management control of the entity." China's securities regulator approved the establishment of JPMorgan First Capital Securities Co at the end of 2010. The venture, headquartered in Beijing, offers services such as stock and bond underwriting and merger advisory. It posted net profit of 52 million yuan ($7.72 million) for January-June, versus a loss of 23 million yuan in the same period a year earlier, showed information First Capital filed at the exchange. A stake sale would come as rival HSBC Holdings PLC awaits regulatory approval to launch a majority-owned joint venture, taking advantage of rules favouring Hong Kong-established banks. HSBC would own up to 51 percent of the venture, while the cap for other foreign banks in such ventures is 49 percent. China has been gradually opening up its financial sector, though some foreign banks have called for the pace to increase. Despite the challenges, no other top-tier foreign bank has exited securities joint ventures in China, betting on long-term opportunities in the world's second-largest economy. Foreign banks that have exited since 2007 include BNP Paribas SA, CLSA, Daiwa Securities Group Inc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, showed a Quinlan & Associates report.

"The European banks are cost-focused, whereas US banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are likely trying to generate revenue, because they're in different market conditions," said Simon Taylor, who was in charge of blockchain product development at Barclays for two years until he left in June to co-found London fintech consultancy 11:FS.

No leading bank has publicly said how much it has invested in blockchain. The six global banks approached by Reuters for this story - in the United States and Europe - declined to say how much they had spent. The WEF estimates a total of about US$1.5 billion has been invested in blockchain by all industries, including financial institutions and tech companies. 'COLUMBUS MISSION'  The UBS "fintech lab" on the 42nd floor of One Canada Square tower in London's Canary Wharf financial district does not look much like a bank office. Ideas are scrawled onto walls in pen and Post-It notes adorn a see-through dividing panel. UBS is regarded in the industry as one of the most innovative European banks. It radically restructured its investment banking arm in 2012 - earlier than most of its European competitors - to focus more on wealth management, but it faces the same cost-cutting pressures.

But while they might be held back by cost pressures, Europe's lenders are trying to keep up with their US peers on the tech front. Earlier this month when Dutch bank ING announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs, it also said it would invest 800 million euros in its technology platform. As Deutsche Bank's share price was sliding towards a 30-year low last month on concerns over a fine from the US Department of Justice, it announced that its new "digital factory" would be staffed by 800 specialists by 2018.

In an ironic reverse, investment banks are now racing to make it work for them - but cash-strapped European players risk falling behind their Wall Street rivals. Blockchain was developed eight years ago, enabling transactions using the digital currency to be processed and settled on a public network without the need for a third party. Now banks are seeking to apply it to private networks they run, to save costs by reducing settlement times and automating systems that are still paper-based, like in trade finance. About 80 percent of top global banks will have launched blockchain projects by next year, the World Economic Forum (WEF) said in August, describing the technology as the future "beating heart" of the financial sector. A survey of 200 top global banks by tech firm IBM last month found that 15 percent will have rolled out commercial blockchain products by the end of 2017. But there is likely to be a transatlantic imbalance in bringing out such products, given the costs involved in developing new technology. While U.S. investment banks moved quickly to restructure and recapitalise after the financial crisis, European players are still struggling with cost-cutting and shoring up their balance sheets. Dozens of patent applications have been filed in total by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America for blockchain-based products, but there is a record of only one being filed by a European bank - Switzerland's UBS. "The European banks are cost-focused, whereas U.S. banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are likely trying to generate revenue, because they're in different market conditions," said Simon Taylor, who was in charge of blockchain product development at Barclays for two years until he left in June to co-found London fintech consultancy 11:FS. "Reading between the lines, that says: 'we want to profit from this, we want to build the thing,'" he said of American banks. Taylor said that dynamic was playing out not just in terms of the amounts of investment in blockchain projects, but also in how U.S. banks are seeking to develop their own products while European banks are taking a more collaborative and less aggressive approach. No leading bank has publicly said how much it has invested in blockchain. The six global banks approached by Reuters for this story - in the United States and Europe - declined to say how much they had spent. The WEF estimates a total of about $1.5 billion has been invested in blockchain by all industries, including financial institutions and tech companies. 'COLUMBUS MISSION' The UBS "fintech lab" on the 42nd floor of One Canada Square tower in London's Canary Wharf financial district does not look much like a bank office. Ideas are scrawled onto walls in pen and Post-It notes adorn a see-through dividing panel. UBS is regarded in the industry as one of the most innovative European banks. It radically restructured its investment banking arm in 2012 - earlier than most of its European competitors - to focus more on wealth management, but it faces the same cost-cutting pressures. "There's constant pressure to deliver," said the bank's blockchain lead Alex Batlin, who is leaving for BNY Mellon - which until recently has not appeared very active in its work on the technology but now seems to be on a spending spree, recently advertising 37 open positions on Blocktribe.com, a website dedicated to blockchain jobs. "I always saw this as a Columbus mission – we go out and look for gold, we don't know what's going to happen, but if we do discover something it could be massive and therefore it's worth investing in," Batlin said, adding that he was always careful to deliver "shareholder value". Banks are investing in blockchain in different ways: some invest directly in start-ups or have "incubator" programmes where they work with start-up staff, others - like UBS - have "labs" in which they experiment with the technology. Some take all of these approaches. They are also working together on the technology in consortia in order to come up with common standards and systems, with the most notable of these being New York-based R3, which includes most of the world's biggest banks. Adam Ludwin, CEO of Chain, a San-Francisco-based blockchain start-up that is working with firms like Citi and Nasdaq, said it would be foolish for banks to spend too much at this point, as the technology was still in an experimentation phase. "You could spend tens of millions but you'd probably be doing it wrong if you were spending hundreds of millions right now," he said. "The nature of new innovation and software development is that you invest incrementally." IN THE GAME In Reuters interviews about tech innovation with banks, blockchain consortia and consultancies, the name of one U.S. investment bank came up more often than any other: Goldman Sachs, which posted a 58 percent jump in third-quarter profits on Tuesday. The bank, which has a history of developing new platforms internally that it then sells to the marketplace, as well as investing in start-ups, recently filed a patent application for a platform for trading foreign exchange via blockchain. "There are some banks – Goldman Sachs being the epitome of this – that ... recognise the future of banking as being more and more a question of technology," said Charley Cooper, managing director of the R3 blockchain consortium. But while they might be held back by cost pressures, Europe's lenders are trying to keep up with their U.S. peers on the tech front. Earlier this month when Dutch bank ING announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs, it also said it would invest 800 million euros in its technology platform. As Deutsche Bank's share price was sliding towards a 30-year low last month on concerns over a fine from the U.S. Department of Justice, it announced that its new "digital factory" would be staffed by 800 specialists by 2018. "We're advising our clients that they would be frankly foolish not to be experimenting (in blockchain technology)," said Deloitte global financial services industry leader Bob Contri.

The New York-based bank is in talks to sell its minority stake in JPMorgan First Capital Securities to its local partner, First Capital Securities Co., according to a statement from the Chinese firm on Thursday. No agreement has been reached, according to the statement. JPMorgan wants to find a new partner for a venture in which it can wield greater control, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified. HSBC Holdings Plc, which remained on the sidelines as JPMorgan and rivals like Credit Suisse Group AG set up minority-owned entities, last year announced plans for a China securities partnership in which it will hold a controlling stake. “Having a minority stake in a China joint venture is no longer attractive because their role is rather passive and they only have limited participation,” Wong Chi Man, a Hong Kong-based analyst at China Galaxy Securities Co., said by phone. “I wouldn’t be surprised if other foreign firms follow suit.” Underwriting, M&A JPMorgan set up the joint venture with First Capital in 2010 after having lagged behind rivals including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in forming tie-ups. It holds a one-third stake in the company, whose business includes equity and debt underwriting and mergers advice. The venture posted net income of 51.7 million yuan ($7.7 million) in the first half of 2016, compared with a loss of 23 million yuan a year earlier. It ranks 53rd among underwriters of share sales in China this year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Deutsche Bank AG’s local partnership is ranked 10th, the highest among foreign-backed ventures, according to the data. “JPMorgan believes in the long-term prospects of China and remains fully committed to our China franchise,” the bank said in an e-mailed statement confirming the announcement by First Capital. “We have a long-term strategic vision for our business in the country and continue to evaluate our options to strengthen our position in China in order to better serve our clients.” HSBC, Goldman HSBC is still waiting for regulatory approval to take a majority share in its planned partnership in the free-trade zone of Qianhai, and it’s unlikely to be operational this year, the U.K. bank’s China CEO Helen Wong said this month. HSBC Chief Executive Officer Stuart Gulliver has said it would be the first securities venture in China mostly owned by a foreign bank. Goldman Sachs has also been seeking more control of its securities partnership in the country. Mark Schwartz, who is stepping down as the firm’s Asia-Pacific chairman, had a long-term goal of securing permission to take full ownership of the investment-banking venture his firm formed with Beijing Gao Hua Securities Co. in 2004, according to people familiar with the matter. “JPMorgan’s move makes sense to me because foreign banks have a lot more options than before,” said China Galaxy’s Wong. “They can go to different free-trade zones like the ones in Shanghai and Qianhai if they aren’t happy with their current shareholding.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 1:30 PM, October 20, 2016 Updated: 4:30 PM, October 20, 2016 HONG KONG - JPMorgan Chase & Co is in talks to sell out of a Chinese securities joint venture with First Capital Securities Co Ltd in what would be the first departure by a top-tier global investment bank from China's securities segment. Wall Street banks like JPMorgan hold only minority stakes in such ventures. The resulting lack of control and limited contribution to total revenue have brought banks frustration at a time when domestic competition has become acute. Almost all leading investment banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc, UBS Group AG, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG have securities ventures with local firms. Shenzhen-listed broker First Capital, in an exchange filing on Thursday, said it is in talks to buy JPMorgan's 33 percent of JP Morgan First Capital Securities Co. It said no transaction has been finalised and that any purchase remains uncertain. JPMorgan confirmed the content of the filing. "China is a key market for the firm globally and for many of our clients outside China. J.P. Morgan believes in the long term prospects of China and remains fully committed to our China franchise," the U.S. bank said in an emailed statement. Neither JPMorgan nor First Capital gave reasons for the move. Some analysts said the U.S. bank could return to China's securities market with a new partner as the outlook for onshore deals remains attractive. Rival Morgan Stanley launched a securities joint venture with Huaxin Securities in 2011, a year after it sold its 34.3 percent of China International Capital Corp Ltd (CICC), the country's top investment bank at the time. "It has been a difficult ride (for foreign banks), but we really feel that it's at tipping point in terms of opportunities and the banks have just a lot left on the table," said Benjamin Quinlan, CEO of financial services consultancy Quinlan & Associates. "There is no alternative avenue for foreign players to go in and China is sending a clear signal that it is liberalizing and I do think they (foreign banks) will be able to get to a stage where they have effective management control of the entity." China's securities regulator approved the establishment of JPMorgan First Capital Securities Co at the end of 2010. The venture, headquartered in Beijing, offers services such as stock and bond underwriting and merger advisory. It posted net profit of 52 million yuan ($7.72 million) for January-June, versus a loss of 23 million yuan in the same period a year earlier, showed information First Capital filed at the exchange. A stake sale would come as rival HSBC Holdings PLC awaits regulatory approval to launch a majority-owned joint venture, taking advantage of rules favoring Hong Kong-established banks. HSBC would own up to 51 percent of the venture, while the cap for other foreign banks in such ventures is 49 percent. China has been gradually opening up its financial sector, though some foreign banks have called for the pace to increase. Despite the challenges, no other top-tier foreign bank has exited securities joint ventures in China, betting on long-term opportunities in the world's second-largest economy. Foreign banks that have exited since 2007 include BNP Paribas SA, CLSA, Daiwa Securities Group Inc and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, showed a Quinlan & Associates report.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/Files Enlarge Caption  Email More A A HONG KONG: JPMorgan Chase & Co is in talks to sell out of a Chinese securities joint venture with First Capital Securities Co Ltd in what would a high-profile departure by a Western bank from China's securities segment. Global investment banks like JPMorgan often hold only minority stakes in such ventures and the resulting lack of control has been a source of frustration at a time when competition from domestic rivals is becoming increasingly acute. Almost all leading investment banks, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc , UBS Group AG , Morgan Stanley , Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG have securities joint ventures with local firms in China. Shenzhen-listed broker First Capital in a stock exchange filing said it is in talks to buy JPMorgan's 33 percent of JP Morgan First Capital Securities Co. It said no transaction has been finalised and that any purchase remains uncertain. JPMorgan confirmed the content of the filing. "China is a key market for the firm globally and for many of our clients outside China. J.P. Morgan believes in the long term prospects of China and remains fully committed to our China franchise," the U.S. bank said in an emailed statement. China's securities regulator approved the establishment of JPMorgan First Capital Securities Co at the end of 2010. The venture is headquartered in Beijing and offers services such as stock and bond underwriting and merger advisory. The venture posted net profit of 52 million yuan (US$7.72 million) in the first half of this year, compared with a loss of 23 million yuan in the same period a year earlier, according to information First Capital filed at the stock exchange.

Construction is set to start in November and wrap up in mid-September 2017. (Photo: CH Architects) An effort to bring residential and business redevelopment into three Detroit neighborhoods is getting a boost from JPMorgan Chase, the mega-bank that has committed to investing $100 million in the city. Chase announced that Detroit won a competitive $5 million grant for the Detroit Strategic Neighborhood Fund, a $30-million project that will boost inclusive development in three areas of the city: The West Village neighborhood on the city's east side, the Clark Park area in southwest Detroit and the Livernois-McNichols area in northwest Detroit. Construction on the first of what will be at least 12 projects funded through the neighborhood fund is set to begin in November. Called The Coe at West Village, the $3.8 million project will build eight new townhouses along Coe Street and four apartments with first-floor retail along Van Dyke near where the two roads connect, with 20% of the residential property set aside as affordable housing. The development is by Woodborn Partners, whose managing partner, Clifford Brown, said construction is expected to be finished by mid-September 2017. ► Related: State to babysit Detroit demolition program The Strategic Neighborhood Fund is a collaboration between the city and the nonprofit community development organizations Invest Detroit, the Detroit Development Fund and Opportunity Resource Fund. "We are making progress on something Detroiters have waited for for a long time, and that is redevelopment in our neighborhoods," Mayor Mike Duggan said at a news conference announcing the grant. Duggan said the Strategic Neighborhood Fund fits in with the city's strategy to rebuild the city's neighborhoods on the 20-minute neighborhood model. The model calls for densely populated, walkable and safe neighborhoods where residents have easy access to shopping, groceries, restaurants, recreation, transit, parks and schools within a 20-minute walk. Duggan said the three selected neighborhoods already have some of the basic elements needed for such a neighborhood and only need  "an intense effort where everybody comes together" for redevelopment.

Construction is set to start in November and wrap up in mid-September 2017.  (Photo: CH Architects) Peter Scher, Chase's head of corporate responsibility, said thriving neighborhoods are critical to Detroit's comeback, and while redevelopment in downtown and Midtown should be celebrated, too often that means pushing out people on the lower end of the economic scale "Too many people are being left behind," Scher said. Detroit's award was one of several granted to efforts in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Miami and New York. They money is part of the bank's 5-year, $125-million neighborhood development initiative. David Blaszkiewicz, president and CEO of Invest Detroit, said the Strategic Neighborhood Initiative will bring residential and business development projects in the three targeted neighborhoods with input from residents and others in the communities. He said about 60% of the projects will be new construction, but there also will be an emphasis on adaptive reuse of existing properties. "What we're trying to do is match the needs of the neighborhoods with the real estate," Blaszkiewicz said. The size and scale of the projects will vary, but "most of them are going to be mixed use projects, meaning we've got both housing and commercial, and in most of them, they'll house first-floor retail as part of the developments."

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is continuing its push to snag wealthier credit-card users and gain market share by introducing a top-tier small-business card with richer rewards than products from rivals. Called Chase Ink Business Preferred, the card offers users an 80,000-point signing bonus when it rolls out later this year, according to Pam Codispoti, president of branded cards for the New York-based bank. Business owners earn 3 points a dollar for the first $150,000 spent on travel, telecommunications, shipping and advertising on social-media and search engines. Purchases after that limit or in other categories earn 1 point per dollar. “The credit-card space is incredibly competitive, and we want to be aggressive in investing in the best products,” Codispoti said in a telephone interview. “Customers tell us the way they’re marketing their products and services is changing—they’re spending more on things like Facebook paid search. To have the opportunity to earn triple points on that is important to them.” Banks have turned to fee-rich credit cards as stubbornly low interest rates crimp profits elsewhere. The frenzied competition has forced them to boost spending on incentives, debut rewards-heavy products and bolster existing offerings. In August, JPMorgan made waves when its new Sapphire Reserve card became available with a 100,000-point signing bonus. The escalating card wars have become costly—American Express Co. lost its largest co-brand relationship with Costco Wholesale Corp. to Citigroup Inc. after it couldn’t come to an agreement with the retailer on fees. American Express, which is scheduled to report third-quarter results after markets close Wednesday, calls itself the top credit-card issuer for U.S. small businesses, according to a presentation in March. The New York-based company doesn’t disclose total purchase volume for the category. Small businesses spend about $61.6 billion a year on JPMorgan’s cards, $28.4 billion on Bank of America Corp.’s and $28.2 billion on Capital One Financial Corp.’s, according to a June 2015 edition of the Nilson Report.  The Chase Ink Business Preferred card’s signing bonus kicks in after users spend $5,000 within the first three months, said Codispoti, who spent almost 12 years at American Express before joining JPMorgan in 2014. The $95 annual fee is waived for the first year if the account is opened at a branch. Users can pool rewards points with JPMorgan’s other cards, she said. Potential rewards The new card’s $150,000 limit for triple points means higher potential rewards than JPMorgan’s existing small business cards, Ink Plus and Ink Cash, as well as competitor offerings including the AmEx Business Gold Rewards charge card. That comes with a 25,000 point signing bonus and triple points in one of five categories on the first $100,000 in purchases. American Express has slumped 14% this year, the second-worst performance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, after competitors bid away some of its biggest partnerships with retailers, airlines and other companies. Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Chenault, who’s been shaking up management and reshaping divisions, vowed to trim $1 billion in expenses by the end of 2017. Felicia Mowll, an AmEx spokeswoman, declined to comment on the competitive landscape for small-business credit cards beyond the company’s Oct. 5 statement announcing expanded rewards for its business Platinum card, with a $450 annual fee. Cardholders now earn 1.5 points per dollar on business purchases of at least $5,000 and get 50% of their points back on first- and business-class airline tickets booked through American Express Travel Services. During a conference call last week, an analyst asked JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake how much more share the bank wanted to grab. It already has about one-fifth of credit-card volume, according to Betsy Graseck, a Morgan Stanley analyst. “It’s a very competitive business and it’s very profitable,” Lake responded. “All other things being equal, we would like to continue to gain share.” American Express Co.Costco Wholesale Corp.JPMorgan Chase & Co.Small BusinessTechnologyNew York Get Crain's Small Business Alert Sign up for our FREE weekly Small Business Alert email newsletter.

In South Florida, a $250,000 two-year grant to Accion will help increase the lending organization’s capacity to serve more micro- and small-business owners, launch its Community Advantage loan program, and expand operations to include Broward County. Accion provides loans up to $50,000 and offers free financial education to small businesses. JPMorgan Chase also will be supporting Grameen America with a two-year $500,000 as it expands to Miami-Dade County. Grameen’s pioneering microlending program will provide small loans to Hispanic women to help them build businesses, achieve higher family incomes and develop entrepreneurial skills. Small businesses are growing fastest among people of color, particularly Latinas and African American women, yet Brookings Institution research shows minority-owned businesses rely significantly more on investments of personal or family wealth than on outside debt or equity. Moreover, only 16 percent of conventional small-business loans go to women entrepreneurs, a U.S. Senate report found, and despite the higher startup rate for African-American owned businesses, these businesses received less than two percent of SBA loans in 2013. Launched in 2014, Small Business Forward is a global initiative to support small businesses with the potential to grow, offer quality employment, and generate financial security and economic opportunity for vulnerable populations and their communities by connecting capital with highly targeted technical assistance and support networks to help small businesses grow sustainably.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Oct 19, 2016 at 10:21AM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Look around the economy right now and there are very few reasons to explain why banks performed so well last quarter, in many cases comfortably exceeding analysts' estimates. When it comes to the nation's biggest banks, in fact, one could argue that there's only one. As the deluge of bank earnings has come in over the past week, the one area in which JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), and Citigroup (NYSE:C) all performed well in was trading -- that is, their Wall Street operations. Banks and trading operations Since the Dodd-Frank Act was passed six years ago, banks have been forced to scale back their high-risk/high-reward proprietary trading desks pursuant to the so-called Volcker Rule, named after former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. This rule largely limits a bank's ability to trade to facilitating the sale and purchase of securities for institutional customers such as hedge funds, university endowments, insurance companies, and sovereign wealth funds, among others. This is known as market making. Instead of simply identifying an opportunity to make money by, say, buying a particular type of bond on the open market, banks can only do so if a client wants to offload those securities. This allows banks to facilitate transactions for clients, but ostensibly reduces the size of trading operations and thereby limits the risk of loss at JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup -- the nation's biggest universal banks. This is particularly important in a financial system like ours in the United States, where taxpayers shoulder the ultimate risk of loss from imprudent trading operations. We do so by way of the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund, which would cover any trading losses that eat into a bank's insured deposits. Trading bonanza But even though the trading operations at these banks have been scaled back, they still contribute to these banks' bottom lines. Indeed, if there was one single reason that JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup all outperformed expectations last quarter, this was it: JPMorgan Chase saw trading revenues climb 33% compared to the year-ago period. Citigroup reported a 16% year-over-year increase. And Bank of America's trading revenue was up 14%. This should matter to investors because trading revenue is notoriously volatile. Some quarters, it's way up, as it was last quarter. But other quarters, it's way down, as it was in the third quarter of last year, when trading revenues fell by double digits. To this end, the dismal trading results from the year-ago quarter also help explain why they were so much higher in the latest quarter on a year-over-year basis. The point here is that the sustainability of these banks' upbeat performances last quarter is far from certain. If interest rates don't begin rising in earnest or regulatory and compliance costs don't miraculously decline, then it will continue to be difficult for these banks to reach their profitability targets in the quarters ahead.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is to announce Wednesday morning that it has made a grant of $5 million toward a $30 million Strategic Neighborhood Fund to drive inclusive economic growth in Detroit's neighborhoods. The fund will support the Detroit Strategic Neighborhood Initiative, a collaborative partnership between Invest Detroit, the Detroit Development Fund and the Opportunity Resource Fund. The new fund will dedicate resources toward commercial and residential real estate, jobs and community infrastructure in three Detroit neighborhoods — West Village, Southwest Detroit and Livernois-McNichols — over the next decade. City officials, business leaders and community organizations were among those present for the official announcement Wednesday morning at Van Dyke Street and Coe Avenue in West Village, where Clifford Brown is developing a mixed-use building with 11-13 residential units and another 1,100 square feet of retail. "This announcement from J. P. Morgan Chase is another example of its deep commitment to Detroit and revitalizing its neighborhoods," Mayor Mike Duggan said in a news release. "Thanks to this funding, we are going to start seeing new small businesses open, existing businesses expand and new residential developments take place in several key areas of the city. This fits in perfectly with our strategy to revitalize our neighborhoods." This newest grant is part of Chase's $125 million, five-year neighborhoods initiative in cities around the country. It will help finance 12 key multi-unit residential, business and mixed-use developments, four in each neighborhood, to create density and tie in with bus and and other essential services. The Strategic Neighborhood fund recently received $4 million from a grant from Reimagining the Civic Commons, a national initiative to revitalize and connect public spaces in urban areas. "J.P. Morgan Chase's $5 million award provides a variety of financing resources to elevate core strengths in three distinct neighborhoods, while creating a development template to apply in additional neighborhoods," said Dave Blaszkiewicz, president and CEO of Invest Detroit. Atlanta, Chicago, Miami and New York also got $5 million grants, the first from the five-year neighborhoods initiative.

For the IMF, it is about “too slow growth for too long” that only “benefits too few”. But for the World Bank, the lingering price volatility of commodities, chiefly among them is the oil price, has not only supported in causing growth challenges for emerging market economies, but created a spill effect. The example was Nigeria. The spill effect was cited as the Sub-Saharan Africa, which depend on the country to progress economically too. The distortion from commodity price crisis has caused global banking industry huge losses in terms of impairment charges and write offs, yet with sizeable debt portfolio. Nigerian banking industry is not an exception. Of course, more than half of the country’s banking industry risk portfolio are from oil and gas related issues, with the rest being a spillover effect of the same sector’s challenge. But facts are fast emerging that Nigerian banking industry are not in the “woods” alone. Just last week, earnings of three of the world’s biggest banks- Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, recorded decline during the third quarter of 2016, as their respective financial statements have shown. Citigroup’s net income fell 9.5 percent to $3.8 billion, from $4.2 billion the same quarter a year ago. Revenues were also down 3.8 percent to $17.8 billion during the July-September period, from $18.5 billion the same period last year. After the release of the results, shares of Citigroup fell 2.4 percent to $48.39 after opening Friday at $48.60 on the U.S. stock market. At JP Morgan Chase, net income fell 7.3 percent to $6.3 billion. That’s was down from $6.8 billion. Despite the challenges, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has maintained that banks in the country are holding fast their respective capital adequacy ratio, allying the fears of failures. Even on the sidelines of the meetings in Washington, CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, assured that it is still an ongoing work with respect to supervision of the banking industry and maintaining the important, reiterating that no bank in Nigeria is in distress. Just like bank in emerging economies, these three global giants manifested a threat of challenges with earnings capacity. JP Morgan Chase, although recorded 8.5 percent to $25.5 billion after posting $23.5 billion in the third quarter of 2015, it was not as usual. Troubled with illegal banking activities, Wells Fargo’s earnings were highly anticipated. Its net income fell 3.4 percent to $5.6 billion in third quarter of 2016, from $5.8 billion during the same period a year ago. But in response to the report of the Dubai-based Arqaam Capital, CBN described it as false and overstatement of issues by the company. It also ruled out the report and reiterated that Deposit Money Banks in the country are sound and have strong capital buffers, despite obvious challenges associated with oil and commodity dependent economies across the globe. The Director of Banking Supervision, Mrs. Token Martins, at the Bankers Committee meeting, he said: “That seven banks are undercapitalised is absolutely not true. “But that is not to say that the banking sector is not feeling the economic headwinds. They are, just like those in every other jurisdiction. It is not strange. Non-performing loans (NPLs) at 11 per cent is not what we need to focus on. “What we need to focus on is if the banks have the capacity to absorb losses that would arise from those NPLs? And the answer is yes. They have very strong capital buffers. “Another thing that is important is that Nigerian banks have very huge capacity to generate income to also absorb those losses, if they do arise. And then the loans that are non-performing now, can they re-perform? Yes, because the underlying assets are still there and they are good,” she said. According to her, the fact that the country has NPLs at a period like this should be expected and is not a thing that any jurisdiction should be demonised about or ridiculed by any report. “There are countries that have NPLs as high as as 15 per cent, some 30 per cent and some countries in Europe have NPLs as high as 80 per cent,” she noted.

Wednesday, November 16, 2016 News Sarawak State Election 2016 Nation Sabah World Brunei Kalimantan Business Sports Football General Tennis Badminton Utusan Borneo Berita Sarawak Berita Sabah Berita Nasional Berita Iban Sukan thesundaypost Columns BPO Seeds BAT Business  European banks risk lagging Wall Street in blockchain race October 21, 2016, Friday LONDON: The blockchain technology behind bitcoin was designed to do away with banks. In an ironic reverse, investment banks are now racing to make it work for them – but cash-strapped European players risk falling behind their Wall Street rivals. Blockchain was developed eight years ago, enabling transactions using the digital currency to be processed and settled on a public network without the need for a third party. Now banks are seeking to apply it to private networks they run, to save costs by reducing settlement times and automating systems that are still paper-based, like in trade finance. About 80 per cent of top global banks will have launched blockchain projects by next year, the World Economic Forum (WEF) said in August, describing the technology as the future ‘beating heart’ of the financial sector. A survey of 200 top global banks by tech firm IBM last month found that 15 per cent will have rolled out commercial blockchain products by the end of 2017. But there is likely to be a transatlantic imbalance in bringing out such products, given the costs involved in developing new technology. While US investment banks moved quickly to restructure and recapitalise after the financial crisis, European players are still struggling with cost-cutting and shoring up their balance sheets. Dozens of patent applications have been filed in total by Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Bank of America for blockchain-based products, but there is a record of only one being filed by a European bank – Switzerland’s UBS. “The European banks are cost-focused, whereas US banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are likely trying to generate revenue, because they’re in different market conditions,” said Simon Taylor, who was in charge of blockchain product development at Barclays for two years until he left in June to co-found London fintech consultancy 11:FS. “Reading between the lines, that says: ‘we want to profit from this, we want to build the thing,’” he said of American banks. Taylor said that dynamic was playing out not just in terms of the amounts of investment in blockchain projects, but also in how US banks are seeking to develop their own products while European banks are taking a more collaborative and less aggressive approach. No leading bank has publicly said how much it has invested in blockchain. The six global banks approached by Reuters for this story – in the United States and Europe – declined to say how much they had spent. The WEF estimates a total of about US$1.5 billion has been invested in blockchain by all industries, including financial institutions and tech companies. The UBS ‘fintech lab’ on the 42nd floor of One Canada Square tower in London’s Canary Wharf financial district does not look much like a bank office. Ideas are scrawled onto walls in pen and Post-It notes adorn a see-through dividing panel. UBS is regarded in the industry as one of the most innovative European banks. It radically restructured its investment banking arm in 2012 – earlier than most of its European competitors – to focus more on wealth management, but it faces the same cost-cutting pressures. “There’s constant pressure to deliver,” said the bank’s blockchain lead Alex Batlin, who is leaving for BNY Mellon – which until recently has not appeared very active in its work on the technology but now seems to be on a spending spree, recently advertising 37 open positions on Blocktribe.com, a website dedicated to blockchain jobs. “I always saw this as a Columbus mission – we go out and look for gold, we don’t know what’s going to happen, but if we do discover something it could be massive and therefore it’s worth investing in,” Batlin said, adding that he was always careful to deliver “shareholder value”.  — Reuters What do you think of this story?

 Trivago is planning to go public by Thanksgiving Portia Crowe Oct. 20, 2016, 5:57 PM 8,337 facebook linkedin twitter email print YouTube/trivago Trivago, the online hotel reservation company backed by Expedia, is expected to list its shares in New York by the end of November, according to people familiar with the matter. Expedia, which owns a majority stake in Trivago, has hired JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley to run the flotation, which will take place on the Nasdaq. Analysts have valued the business at $5 billion. The deal size wasn't immediately clear, but one person said that Trivago had initially told bankers it was interested in raising as much as $1 billion. That would make it the largest tech IPO in the US this year, and — to this person — is a stretch.  Expedia said in July that it would explore an IPO of Trivago, with an aim to list the shares by the end of the year.  "An IPO would allow investors to value Trivago as a separate standalone company," Expedia's CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said at the time. "Expedia does not plan to sell any of our shares in an IPO, and there are no guarantees that an IPO will ultimately be pursued or be successful." Expedia said in July that Trivago had generated $200 million in revenue in the second quarter, and more than $660 million on a trailing 12-month basis. That means it was able to file its S-1 document under the Jumpstart our Business Startups (or JOBS) Act, which allows small companies with less than $1 billion in annual revenue to file for IPOs privately with the SEC. Expedia CEO Dara Khosrowshahi attends the Allen & Co Media Conference in Sun Valley. Thomson Reuters Once the offering document is public, the company has to wait three weeks before the share sale can proceed. Trivago could make its filing public as soon as next week in order to list by Thanksgiving.  Of course, an IPO in late November would be dependent on investor appetite for new shares following the US presidential election. The flotation could be derailed by a volatile market. The listing would mark another step toward the tech IPO market's comeback. Deal activity all but stopped last year as investor sentiment soured, and has been slow to pick up in 2016.  The largest tech IPO to date was by Japanese messaging app Line, which listed in Tokyo and New York in July and raised $1.24 billion, about two-thirds of which was in the US. Expedia declined to comment. Reuters previously reported that the company has hired banks for the deal.

Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr It will be a heck of a resilient performance if BAC can end the year with gains. Shares were down nearly 30% around the time the market suffered a late-June selloff. With BAC showing progress in everything from trading to loans to cost cuts, sentiment is finally at its back. Take a look at BAC’s price-to-book ratio, which has been climbing for more than three months. It’s up to 0.68 from a midsummer low of 0.55. True, a PB below one on a bank stock indicates investors have questions about the bank’s risk profile. But at least the trend suggests that BofA is starting to get the benefit of the market’s doubt. A greater sense of optimism can be seen in BAC stock’s relative performance since the June tumble. Shares are up 35% since then. That smokes the money-center bank competition: JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) gained just 6% over the same span. Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) is up 28%. Naturally Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) is negative. 16 Best Stocks to Buy Under President Hillary Clinton At last it’s starting to dawn on the market that there is value to be had in Bank of America stock. The firm is making strong progress on the top and bottom lines and has more cost cuts to go. At the same time, shares look cheap. The bank’s price-to-book made sense in wake of the financial crisis, but BofA is well past that now. Plenty of Risk for BAC Stock Every investment comes with risk and Bank of America has plenty. On the big stage, the firm is highly levered to the health of the domestic economy. For the most part that’s been a source of good news. Although, low oil prices give BAC trouble with its loans to the energy industry, the total exposure is quite low. More importantly, unemployment is low, while hiring and wages are up. Consumer confidence and the housing market are generally positive too. Other risks, as pointed out by analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, include the depth of the management bench and future federal stress tests. But of course a prolonged period of low interest rates is the biggest knock against banks. Remember that even if the Federal Reserve’s lifts rates as expected in December, that only applies to the short part of the yield curve. Beyond that, the market remains in control. As long as low inflation expectations and a generalized fear of risk persist, you can bet that rates will remain under pressure. Lastly, there’s been some hand-wringing over the Department of Labor’s contentious fiduciary rule. BAC said it will minimally impact revenue, with the caveat that it was still “too soon to tell.” Just keep in mind that, KBW notes, the Department of Labor rule would impact less than 10% of the bank’s $2 trillion of client assets. American Express Company (AXP) Stock Climbs Higher on Earnings Beat It could take a long time before the market starts valuing BAC more on the future than its past. That doesn’t mean the value isn’t there. As of this writing, Dan Burrows did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Sulzberger will take over the newspaper company that has struggled to reinvent itself. New York Times Co.’s heir apparent is inheriting a newspaper company that’s struggling to transform itself. His cross-town rival is getting more support from Wall Street as it faces the same challenges. Times Co. shares are down 14% this year—while the Wall Street Journal owner’s stock has risen slightly—as investors question whether the Times’ new global strategy can offset the exodus of advertisers. Last quarter, the loss of print advertising accelerated, while digital ad revenue slumped for the second period in a row. The Journal has had its own struggles, but its parent News Corp. has other divisions to rely on. The Times sold off its other units in recent years, putting all its eggs in one basket: journalism. Arthur Gregg Sulzberger, 36, whose promotion to deputy publisher on Wednesday positions him to become the Times’ next publisher and chairman, will eventually take over a company that looks very different from the one that his father, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., has led for two decades. Gone are the website About.com, other newspapers like the Boston Globe and an investment in the Discovery Times cable channel. “The New York Times sold everything that’s not nailed down to pay down their debt, so they have as long a runway as possible to deliver a digital business,” said Paul Sweeney, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “While the company has clearly established a vibrant digital business, the jury is still out on whether that can offset the declining print business.” The Times’ strategy stands in contrast to the one employed by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp., which owns the Wall Street Journal, but is diversifying to be less exposed to the newspaper industry’s struggles. The company, spun off from 21st Century Fox in 2013, has found growth in its digital real estate unit, where sales rose 21% last quarter. It also owns book publisher Harper Collins, newspapers in the U.K. and a pay-TV company in Australia. It recently got into the British radio business as well. News Corp. shares were up 2.2% this year through Wednesday even though the flagship newspaper has struggled like the Times. The more diverse revenue base has made shareholders more forgiving. Of four analysts who cover Times Co., none recommends buying the stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Six out of 12 advise buying News Corp. shares. “Because they are investing in non-newspaper businesses, and specifically in digital businesses, there’s more diversity,” said Alexia Quadrani, a media analyst at JPMorgan Chase & Co. who has a “hold” rating on the stock. “It gives investors hope.” Bloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, competes with News Corp. in providing financial news and services. Cutting costs Both newspapers are taking measures to cut costs and reshape themselves to contend with the industry’s threats. In May, the Times offered buyouts to newsroom staffers and employees in its business departments, without ruling out the possibility of firings. News Corp.’s Dow Jones division told the union at the Wall Street Journal it’s preparing to restructure and may eliminate some jobs, the newspaper reported this week. In a memo Wednesday, William Lewis, chief executive officer of Dow Jones, said he was starting a review of the Journal’s operations. “These are challenging times,” Lewis said. “I thank you in advance for your patience and understanding as we set about the difficult task of continuing to build our digital future while responding to the decline in traditional advertising.” The rest of the newspaper industry isn’t doing much better. Publishers are merging and slashing costs to buy time while figuring out how to make more money online. A fortunate few newspapers have been bought by billionaires—like the Washington Post’s Jeff Bezos—who are willing to give the newsroom time and resources to try new things. As readers get more of their news online, newspaper advertising is expected to shrink to $5 billion by 2019 from a peak of $49 billion in 2005, according to the ad agency Magna Global. The Times has outlined its own strategy for adapting to the shifting landscape. It plans to rely more on readers paying for its journalism and double its digital revenue in the next four years. A big part of that effort will involve spending $50 million to expand its audience around the world. Last week, for instance, the Times unveiled a new, redesigned international edition, in print and online, to attract paid readers outside the U.S. 'Amazing success' Quadrani said the Times has had “amazing success” with its online subscription business, which has more than 1.4 million customers. The Wall Street Journal recently topped 1 million digital-only subscribers. The Times and Journal “are the only two newspapers in this country that have created viable and vibrant digital platforms,” Sweeney said. Few understand the Times’ challenges better than the younger Sulzberger, who has been responsible for leading a team focused on the newsroom’s digital transformation. He led the task force that two years ago wrote its “Innovation Report,” which detailed how the newspaper needed to adapt to new competition from digital media companies such as BuzzFeed and the Huffington Post. A new report on how the Times will prepare for the future is now under way. “He has a strong technological background,” Sweeney said of Sulzberger. “It’s a new generation of family ownership that understands the opportunity of the digital world.” The Times, like Murdoch’s News Corp. and many other media companies, has two classes of voting shares that insulate the controlling family from Wall Street pressure. Thanks to its 11% stake in the company, the Sulzberger family, including a trust, receives about $2.8 million a year in dividends, based on company filings. The Times suspended the dividend in 2009 as it coped with the increasing damage the internet was inflicting on print advertising. A 4-cent a share quarterly payout was restored in late 2013. “Many newspaper families have sold out because they recognized the newspaper business can no longer support dividends and equity value,” Sweeney said. “But the Sulzberger family really believes that the New York Times plays a role in society and has global value.” Bloomberg LPNew York Times Co.News Corp.Rupert MurdochWall StreetInternationalTechnologyReal EstateNew YorkThe Wall Street JournalDataInvestment Get Crain's Digital NY Alert Sign up for our FREE weekly Digital NY email newsletter.

Discover Card AmEx credit metrics roughly flat in October (Seeking Alpha) American Express Company(NYSE: AXP) shares are up sharply after posting a solid third quarter that blew away earnings estimates. The stock is leading the S&P 500 with a 10 percent gain. American Express beat earnings estimates by $0.23, $1.20 vs $0.97 consensus estimate. A major key for the American Express' solid quarter was that planned expense saves were realized faster than expected, which in turn boosted 2016 EPS guidance. Increasing competition from JPMorgan Chase & Co.(NYSE: JPM) remains American Express' biggest threat. "We believe rewards competition continues to e one of the biggest risks to AXP, especially after JP Morgan's wildly successful launch of the Chase Sapphire Reserve card," Barclays said in a note. American Express is working to improve its Platinum cards value, which could weigh on rewards expenses in 2017. "Given the compelling value Chase gives cardholders for spend on travel and dining, we are concerned that AXP will struggle to sustain its share of high spend transactors," Barclays added. Barclays maintains an Equal-Weight rating on American Express with a $63.00 price target.

The National Credit Union Administration said the contingency fees represented 23.2 percent of the $4.3 billion the agency recovered in settlements with banks over their sale of faulty securities to five credit unions that later failed. The announcement marked the first time the NCUA had revealed the lawsuits' costs. NCUA Board Chairman Rick Metsger said the agency previously withheld disclosing its fee arrangements to protect its litigation position and ensure maximum returns. "Without this fee arrangement, which shifted most of the risk of these legal actions to outside counsel, there would have been no legal investigation of potential claims, no litigation, and no legal recoveries," Metsger said. The payouts came after settlements with banks, including Morgan Stanley, (MS.N) Bank of America Corp,(BAC.N) JPMorgan Chase & CO (JPM.N) and Barclays Plc(BARC.L). Most recently, last month the NCUA announced a $1.1 billion deal with Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc(RBS.L). The payouts went to two law firms, Korein Tillery LLC and Kellogg, Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans & Figel PLLC, which pursued lawsuits against the banks. Neither firm immediately responded to a request for comment on Thursday. The sum was more than double what another regulator that pursued a similar set of lawsuits against many of the same banks last year said it paid while obtaining an even larger amount of recoveries. The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which has acted as conservator for mortgage funders Fannie Mae (FNMA.PK) and Freddie Mac FMCC (FMCC.PK) since their government takeover in 2008, in September 2015 disclosed paying two other law firms $406.7 million. The sum, which reflected around 2 percent of the $18.7 billion it obtained through settlements and judgments against 16 banks, has likely grown since then amid ongoing litigation by FHFA against RBS. The FHFA had no immediate comment on Thursday.
