READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Business Insider (feedback@businessinsider.com) Sep 24th 2016 11:04AM Wall Street dealmakers used to be sent to Hong Kong or London to win new business. Now they're being sent to Seattle, Atlanta, and Denver. Bank of America, JPMorgan, and Citigroup have been taking steps to do more business with midsize companies in regional centers in the US, outside the traditional hubs like New York, Houston, and San Francisco. They have moved and hired dealmakers there, and they have them focused on so-called middle-market companies. The potential rewards are significant: Middle-market companies in the US and Canada paid $8.2 billion in deal fees in 2015, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch presentation. That's more than the fees netted in most of Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America combined. "This is a key focus for us as we have developed the other areas of our investment bank," Christian Meissner, the head of global corporate and investment banking at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, told Business Insider. "Relatively speaking, this represents a greater opportunity than some traditional avenues of growth." Local expertise Each bank cuts it slightly differently, but broadly speaking the largest multinational corporations are serviced by the corporate banking divisions within big global banks. These companies — think Apple, GE, Ford, and the like — have bankers crawling over them, trying to win every last piece of business they have to offer. Facebook/Visit Seattle The commercial banking divisions typically serve tens of thousands of smaller (but by no means small) companies, and it is the commercial banking clients that the banks are hoping to do more business with. "The premise behind regional investment banking starts from extending relationships from the commercial bank," James Roddy, who oversees the regional investment banking and M&A business at JPMorgan, told Business Insider. JPMorgan drew up plans in 2012 to focus on middle-market banking and now has about 50 people in the investment bank dedicated to this group of clients, having hired local, senior, experienced bankers in a handful of regional centers over the past three or four years. Each location — including Atlanta, Dallas, and Washington, DC — will typically have a managing director, an executive director, a vice president, and an associate on the ground. "This isn't about doing smaller deals," Roddy said. "It is working with people where we're already providing treasury services or commercial banking, and we have an opportunity to provide a full service that includes investment banking." The effort is paying off. Doug Petno, the chief executive of JPMorgan's commercial bank, cited growing investment-banking revenue from commercial banking clients at the bank's investor day in February. Revenue from this client segment hit $2.2 billion in 2015, and the bank has a long-term target of $3 billion. Facebook/Visit Seattle It's a similar story at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Many of the bank's clients told the bank they felt that it wasn't local enough and that they would get only occasional coverage from investment bankers who would fly in from New York or another major city. To remedy that, the bank has assigned about two dozen bankers over the past couple of years to focus on this segment of clients. "These are almost always existing clients of the firm," Meissner told Business Insider. "We have the commercial bank, the midmarket lending business, where we have something like 30,000 clients across the US. What's new is whereas previously they would have gotten episodic investment-banking attention, now they have a dedicated investment banker in addition to their existing relationship banker from commercial banking." Citigroup, meanwhile, is reviewing plans to put a banker in Denver as part of its energy coverage team, in addition to its existing presence in New York, Chicago, Houston, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. An opportunity that was always there The opportunity to win business in these regional cities isn't new — it's just that banks had been more focused chasing opportunities elsewhere. The renewed interest in less glamorous clients and locations comes at a time when many of these more exotic growth markets are slowing. Facebook/Visit Seattle The $8.2 billion fee pool for US and Canadian middle-market companies is comparable with the fees paid by companies in Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and Asia Pacific excluding Japan put together. "This isn't a new idea; it's a different approach," Meissner said. Given the challenging market conditions, any area showing growth is sure to become competitive. And sure enough, the middle-market investment-banking business is now more keenly fought over than in the past, Roddy said. "It is happening right now," he said. "People are waking up to it. We've been doing it for a while, so it is nice to be ahead of the curve."

Combined fees from advising on deals and from equity and debt underwriting have dropped a 18.5 per cent this year at JPMorgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co, Bank of America Corp, Citigroup Inc, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Thomson Reuters data shows. Despite an uptick in IPOs since June, activity remains below 2015 levels, largely due to low US interest rates that have made it easy for companies to borrow cheaply and made it more attractive for them to raise funds through debt offerings. Fees for debt issues are typically lower than those on equity offerings. The US Federal Reserve had been expected to raise interest rates four times this year, but the central bank hasn't budged. Eight companies made their market debut this week, raising a total of US$1.22 billion (RM5.03 billion). Five listed one or more of the six big banks as a lead manager, according to Renaissance Capital, a manager of IPO-focused ETFs. Just 70 companies have gone public this year through yesterday, down from 122 in the same period last year ― the lowest since 2009. The amount raised totaled about US$11.8 billion, a drop of 52 per cent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Equity offerings in the United States fell 36 per cent to US$122.7 billion through the week of September 16. Debt offerings were little changed at US$1.7 trillion. Tough year “The first half of this year has been a uniquely difficult environment for underwriting revenue on the equity side,” Jeffery Harte, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill told Reuters. Jay Ritter, an IPO expert and a professor at the University of Florida, said 2016 would be a moderate year for IPOs. “Investment banking underwriting revenue will almost certainly decline this year,” he said. “Equity underwriting is the most profitable part of the business, but IPO volume is down and the trend for follow-on offerings to be done with bought deals rather than fully marketed bookbuilt deals is also lowering the average revenue per deal.” The Fed's target rate for overnight lending between banks is 0.25 per cent to 0.50 per cent, where it has been since December last year when it was raised for the first time in nearly a decade. Apart from low interest rates, US investment banks have been hit by weak oil prices, Britain's vote to leave the European Union and concerns about global economic growth. Globally, investment banks suffered their worst first-half performance since the 2008 financial crisis, with revenue for the top 12 players falling 15 per cent from a year earlier, according to industry analytics firm Coalition. Even so, US banks took the top five spots in global investment banking revenue during the period. JPMorgan, the biggest US bank by assets, retained its spot at the top of the global investment bank rankings despite a drop of 11.7 per cent in fees from investment banking. The bank was an underwriter for the IPO of Japanese messaging app operator Line Corp, the biggest US IPO so far this year. Line's shares soared as much as 36 per cent in their debut, valuing the company at US$9.34 billion. ― Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Fintech association anticipates regional investments European stocks falter, euro hits 12-month dollar low Donald Trump takes credit for helping to save a Ford plant that wasn’t closing Trump has made equities great again, as investors flee bonds With Trump win, China looks to seize Asia free trade leadership Foreign banks shaken by Malaysia's move to halt currency slide Bank Negara instructs foreign banks to refrain from offshore ringgit trading, sources claim Malaysia Airlines mulling purchase of 25 widebody jets next year Ex-Valeant executive, ex-pharmacy CEO charged for fraud scheme Bank Negara Malaysia says it is intervening in currency market Most Watched Now Week Britney Spears, TInashe get down for a ‘Slumber Party’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) A Tribe Called Quest spit fire in ‘We the People’ (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Bloomberg Video: Resurrecting Jaguar’s legendary XKSS supercar Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Did you know: The ocean is way deeper than you think Reuters Video: Thailand sinks boats to tackle illegal fishing Related Articles JPMorgan to pay US$264m to resolve China hiring probe Ahead of Trump presidency, global investors sell bonds and grab stocks Dollar hits 11-month peak alongside US yields, bank stocks up Oil rebounds from three-month lows on renewed hopes for OPEC cut Wall Street ends flat as financials’ rise offsets tech drop Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

London : JPMorgan retained its place at the top of the global investment bank rankings in the first half of this year despite a fall in revenues, while Deutsche Bank's troubles ensured the top five were all U.S banks, new data on Friday showed. JPMorgan's revenue from trading, mergers and acquisitions and other investment banking activity was $12.5 billion in the six months to June, down 5.3 per cent from the same period a year ago, according to data compiled by industry analytics firm Coalition. Deutsche has warned it may need deeper cost cuts to turn itself around after revenue fell sharply in the second quarter due to challenging markets and low interest rates. It fell to sixth place from third, allowing Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) to move up into the top five. Investment banks suffered their worst first half year performance since the 2008 financial crisis as revenues for the top 12 players fell 15 per cent from the same period a year ago, the data showed. Looming U.S elections, Britain's vote to leave the European Union in June, near-zero interest rates and worries about China's economy have spooked markets this year and curbed investors' appetite to take risks. Last week, Citigroup (C.N) said it expects to post better results in fixed income trading for the third quarter compared with a year ago. Most of JPMorgan's revenue, some $6.9 billion, was accrued on its home turf but the $3.9 billion generated in its Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) operations was enough to dislodge Deutsche from the top place in that region. In the same period last year, Deutsche was number one in EMEA with revenue of $4.3 billion. Its slide to number two, even on its home turf highlights how difficult a year it has been for Germany's biggest lender. JPMorgan also dislodged Deutsche Bank in the Asia Pacific (APAC region) to take top spot with revenue of $1.7 billion in the first half of the year. That was 15 per cent lower than the $2 billion Deutsche Bank earned in the same period last year in the region. JPMorgan retained its crown in fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) trading, its position solidified by its dominance in G10 rates and foreign exchange trading. The U.S bank slipped a place to third in the equities ranking, however. Coalition tracks Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Societe Generale and UBS.

The New York-based firm made the most money from raw materials among the top 12 investment banks after coming top in the past two years, according to Coalition Development Ltd., a London-based business analytics company. JPMorgan Chase & Co. came second and Citigroup Inc. dropped to third, Coalition said in a report Friday. Revenue at the 12 banks fell by a quarter to $2.2 billion from a year earlier on weak performances in energy and industrial metals, it said earlier this month. That was the worst first half in at least a decade, Coalition estimated. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and BNP Paribas SA came next in the ranking, followed by UBS Group AG, HSBC Holdings Plc and Societe Generale SA, it said. Coalition tracks commodities activities including power and gas, oil, metals, coal and agriculture. Several banks in the ranking have scaled back or abandoned commodities businesses amid increased regulatory scrutiny. The analysis doesn’t include Australian, Canadian or emerging-market banks that have a large presence in commodities. It does include Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, and Barclays Plc.

(UK) / Alamy Stock Photo  Peter Foster, Europe Editor 24 September 2016 • 2:49pm The bosses of several of America’s biggest banks and corporations have warned Theresa May they will pre-emptively shift operations into Europe unless she can provide early clarity on the future shape of EU-UK relations, The Telegraph has learned. The ultimatum was delivered at a round-table meeting with Mrs May in New York this week attended by a host of key US investors, including major City investors such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and BlackRock. According to an account of the meeting obtained by The Telegraph, Mrs May declined to provide information about how the British government would approach the Brexit negotiations, other than pursuing a deal that was “in the national interest”. Jean-Claude Juncker answers awkward question about Brexit Play! 01:24 There followed “frank exchanges” in which bosses warned they could not wait to discover the final outcome of the two-year Article 50 negotiations before making major investment decisions that could see thousands of UK jobs shift to Europe. “The message was clear from at least some of those present: if Theresa May cannot provide some early clarity about where the negotiations will end up, the only way to avoid that uncertainty would be a move towards Europe – there will not be time to wait,” said the City source with knowledge of the meeting. Before the June 23 vote to leave the EU, the heads of several major foreign banks including JPMorgan and UBS warned that “significant” numbers of jobs could be shipped to Europe when the impacts of Brexit became clear. Estimates of possible City job losses from a “hard Brexit” have ranged widely from 40,000 to 80,000 over the next decade, with JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley saying they could shift over 1,000 employees. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America have also warned of jobs losses to the Continent. What is Article 50? (EU, Brexit) The move piles pressure on Mrs May whose determination to “take back control” of Britain’s borders after Brexit, it is now widely assumed, will make it impossible to retain the City’s current “passporting” rights that enable UK-based financial services companies to trade freely in Europe. A separate source in Whitehall said that Philip Hammond, the Chancellor, has walked back his initially optimistic predictions for the City post-Brexit, cautioning banks that the retention of “passporting” is highly unlikely given Mrs May’s stance on ending EU free movement. Downing Street’s uncompromising line on curbing EU migration has caused friction between Mr Hammond and Mrs May’s political team which is dominated by former Home Office officials who “understand the politics of migration rather better than the economy”, the source said. Martin Schulz: Don't take too long triggering Article 50 Play! 01:38 Financial services generate more than £60bn pounds a year in tax, a quarter of which comes from foreign-owned banks, revenues that the Treasury fears will now be put in jeopardy. According to the account of the New York meeting, banks now accept the likely loss of EU pass-porting but warned Mrs May there must be guaranteed transitional arrangements to give firms the time and certainty they need to adapt to the new regime. Anthony Browne, chief executive of the British Bankers' Association, delivered a similar call for transitional arrangements when giving evidence to a House of Lords committee earlier this month, warning of the risks of a “cliff-edge” Brexit. FAQ | Brexit and the City of London UK Treasury officials are now heavily pre-occupied with how to put in place transitional arrangements that – they readily concede – will only be possible with the political good will of the other 27 EU member states. “A final deal could take years to negotiate, the real question everyone is focussing on now is what you do in between times that provides confidence and certainty to all business,” said an official with knowledge of the UK preparations. The difficulties will be both practical and political, however, as European capitals continue to harden their stance ahead of future negotiations, ruling out any “cherry-picking” by the British side when it comes to accessing the single market. Professor Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory, has suggested that continuing existing arrangements for three years after Brexit could give space for a deal to be nailed down – but concedes this would require continuing to accept EU free movement during that transitional period. Theresa May: I wouldn't invoke Article 50 until the UK has secured better deals Play! 00:42 The Telegraph understands that Mr Hammond has already cautioned bank bosses that delaying taking back control of borders for three years would be politically impossible, a position that would leave British negotiators ultimately reliant on EU goodwill. “Financial services is very complicated and asking the EU to concede transitional arrangements is fixing one key piece of the negotiation before it has even started,” Prof Winters said, “We’d be asking them to give away one of their biggest pieces of leverage.” In Brussels the current mood is defiant. Asked by The Telegraph recently about possible transitional controls, a senior EU official shrugged and smiled, adding: “Why would we? What’s in it for us?” British negotiators hope, however, that common sense and mutual interest will prevail, citing the importance of the City to for EU capital markets and the continued creakiness of Italian and Portuguese banks as reasons why the EU will also want a smooth transition.

The rules proposed Friday will be another boon for merchant houses including Trafigura Group Pte and Vitol SA, which already are luring employees away with the promise of better pay and less red tape, said Ross Gregory, managing consultant at Commodity Search Partners, a London-based employment company. “It’s going to be another sign for these guys who think, ‘It’s just more rope around our necks,’ which is already pushing more of them to go work at trading houses," Gregory said in a telephone interview from New York, where he’s based. The Fed proposal would require banks to put up more capital to support investments in physical commodities, limit the amount of trading and restrict ownership of power plants and copper. The central bank estimated the plan would require about $4 billion in additional capital from firms including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley. The goal is to reduce the financial risks posed by such trading, Fed officials said. Paring Back Lenders including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank AG have been paring back their commodity units in recent years, as regulators tightened restrictions following the financial crisis. The merchant trading houses have stepped into their place. US-based Castleton Commodities International LLC bought Morgan Stanley’s physical oil trading arm last year, while JPMorgan sold its physical trading business to Swiss-based Mercuria Energy Group Ltd in 2014.  Meanwhile, former commodities executives have left Wall Street to establish their own firms. David Silbert, who built the commodities business at Deutsche Bank, founded TrailStone Group in 2013 with financing from private equity. Ben Freeman, a former Goldman Sachs oil derivatives trader, created HudsonField LLC with the support of AllianceBernstein Holding LP, with the aim of catering to middle-market oil firms no longer served by the banks. Don’t Touch “This is going to redound to the benefit of the merchant traders," said Craig Pirrong, a professor at the University of Houston’s Bauer College of Business. “It’s very clear that the Fed does not want banks touching physical commodities, no way, no how." The Fed proposal should come as little surprise to most players after years of debate over the banks’ influence on commodity markets, Pirrong said in a telephone interview. If there’s a downside for trading houses, it’s that it may get harder for them to tap banks to finance long-term trades and asset purchases, he said. Gregory, the employment specialist, estimated about 10 to 20 percent of the banks’ teams are leaving each year to join trading houses. Salaries offered by trading houses and banks are roughly comparable, at about $250,000 for a “strong" senior trader, Gregory said. But trading houses give a bigger cut of profits on top of salary. Merchant houses typically pay traders about 12 percent of the annual profits they generate, while banks offer closer to 5 percent, he said. “Some people are locked into the banks with golden handcuffs because their deferred bonuses are large, but they would take an option to get out if they can find it," he said. In addition to individual workers, whole trading businesses may be on the move as well, according to Gregory. “It wouldn’t surprise me if some of these trading houses see an opportunity to say to the banks, ‘Hey, do you guys want me to take this off your hands?’" Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Sought is judgment in the amount of $117,028.84, plus interest, attorney’s fees and costs. Judgments recorded The Campton Funeral Home, 525 Delaware Ave., Palmerton, has placed on record a judgment entered in its favor by Magisterial District Justice William Kissner of Palmerton. The judgment is against Shannon W. Reeser, 48 E. Water St., Lansford, in the amount of $7,567.03, stemming from breach of contract regarding funeral services rendered by the business. Capital One Bank, Glen Allen, Virginia, has filed judgments against two individuals that were ordered by magisterial district justices. One judgment is against Ida L. Mefford, 2015 Penn Forest Trail, Albrightsville. It was entered on Sept. 20, 2011, by Magisterial District Judge Edward M. Lewis of Jim Thorpe in the amount of $1,972.50. The second judgment is against Pearl Sittler, 1720 Stagecoach Road West, Palmerton. It was entered on Sept. 21, 2011, by Magisterial District Judge William Kissner of Palmerton in the amount of $1,819.17. Credit default A credit account default suit has been filed by Velocity Investments LLC, Wall, New Jersey, against Maryann Hartman, 323 E. Fell St., second floor, Summit Hill. The suit contends Velocity purchased the Lending Club Corporation account in which the defendant is in default. Judgment in the amount of $18,040.77, plus the cost of the suit, is sought. Zoning violation Towamensing Township, 120 Stable Road, Lehighton, has filed a judgment entered in its possession by Magisterial District Judge William Kissner of Palmerton against Matthew Higgins Jr., 100 Twin Flower Circle, Kunkletown. The judgment was ordered on Nov. 30, 2015, in the amount of $12,000, plus filing fees of $162.50. An accompanying document in the filing states Higgins is the owner of a property at the above address, which is situated in a residential zoning district. The pleading states the defendant installed an accessory structure on the property without applying for and obtaining a zoning permit, the action being in violation of the township’s regulations concerning minimum yard requirements. The plaintiff claims the defendant failed to appeal an enforcement notice sent to him by the township’s zoning hearing board, and has been in violation of a former ordinance of the township from Oct. 25, 2014, until March 16, 2015, and a new but similar one enacted on March 16, 2015. Complaint in replevin A complaint in replevin has been filed by William R. Kirchgessner, Carlstadt, New Jersey, against Michael G. Heitczman, 433 Third St., Weatherly. The plaintiff alleges he extended a loan in the amount of $27,575.25 to the defendant on Sept. 23, 2012, in order for him to purchase a 2007 Chevrolet, at which time the defendant granted to the plaintiff the first lien on the vehicle. The suit states that as of July 20, 2016, the defendant has made payments in the amount of $17,594.11, but is in default of the balance of $10,633.10. Kirchgessner is seeking judgment against the defendant for possession of the vehicle or, in the alternative, for damages of $10,633.10, plus interest. Ejectment complaint U.S. Bank N.A., Salt Lake City, Utah, has filed a complaint in ejectment against Mike Smith and occupants, 72 Hi Arc Lane, Ashfield. The complaint states the plaintiff became owner of a property at the above address through a mortgage foreclosure and sheriff’s sale case in which Smith was the previous owner. Despite becoming the property owner, the suit states the defendant(s) are in possession of the property without title. The bank is seeking judgment in ejectment for immediate possession of the premises and asks the court to order issuance of an immediate writ of possession.

John Maxfield (JohnMaxfield37) Sep 23, 2016 at 1:20PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. What are the biggest banks in America? That depends on what you mean by "big." The traditional way to measure a bank's size is by its balance sheet -- that is, the cumulative value of its assets. But the flaw in this approach is that it doesn't actually reflect what a bank is worth. Banks are highly leveraged institutions, typically holding $10 worth of assets for every $1 dollar in capital. The latter, not the former, more closely approximates a bank's net worth. Given this, another way to measure a bank's size is by looking at its shareholders' equity, or book value. But this too has shortcomings, as most banks don't trade for book value. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Citigroup (NYSE:C), for example, are currently priced at 35% discounts to their book values. Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), meanwhile, trade for 29% and 7% premiums, respectively, to their book values. So, how do you reconcile the fact that a bank's book value only roughly approximates its actual value? The answer is to look at its market capitalization. What is this, you ask? According to The Motley Fool's knowledge center: Market capitalization is one of the best measures of a company's size. Also known as market cap, market capitalization is the total market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. For example, you may have heard Apple referred to as "the most valuable company in the world." That's because Apple currently has the highest market cap of any publicly traded company. A company's market cap is thus derived by taking its shareholders' equity and then multiplying that by the premium or discount to book value that its shares currently trade at. With this in mind, here are the nation's 10 biggest banks by market cap: Bank Market Capitalization (millions) JPMorgan Chase $241,461 Wells Fargo $231,187 Bank of America $159,909 Citigroup $136,407 U.S. Bancorp $74,007 PNC Financial $44,600 Bank of New York Mellon $43,257 Capital One Financial $36,286 BB&T $31,171 State Street $27,711 Data source: YCharts.com. As you can see, there's a clear difference between the four biggest banks in the country -- the "too big to fail" banks -- and the rest. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo have market caps above $200 billion, while Bank of America and Citigroup are the only other two that eclipse $100 billion. It's also worth noting that these figures fluctuate in line with a bank's stock price. To this end, for the last few years, Wells Fargo was actually the biggest bank by market cap, despite the fact that its balance sheet is roughly a third smaller than JPMorgan Chase's. After Wells Fargo's recent troubles, however, it's fallen back to second place. And while Bank of America and Citigroup lag far behind their bigger (by market cap) peers, the gap will undoubtedly narrow as their profits continue to improve from where they were eight years ago at the nadir of the financial crisis. In short, while measuring the size of a bank by its market cap is only one way to do so, it's an important concept for investors to know.

Parker said investors have been "pilling in" to asset classes, which are perceived to be "safe havens." These include minimum volatility ETFs that offer exposure to utilities, consumer staples and other sectors that offer a "more attractive yield." Related Link: A Surprise Among Utilities ETFs However, sectors such as utilities are no longer trading at a discount; rather, they are trading at a premium to the market. "When you think about safety, safety is a reflection not just of the fundamentals but also of the price you are paying," he expanded. "We are telling clients to be cautious about chasing yields at this point." Despite his cautious tone, he added that one of the "really positive" themes of the market year-to-date is that many of these safe sectors have outperformed the broader market. However, investors are indeed becoming "nervous" about the current price to buy these supposed safe haven investments. Parker continued that in order for stocks to continue moving forward there needs to be better earnings and economic growth along with a higher inflation rate. His personal expectation is for growth to be "modest" and overall "positive." Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

 Walmart forges processing partnership with Chase BI Intelligence Sep. 23, 2016, 12:43 PM 1,524 facebook linkedin twitter email print This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "Payments Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. BII See Also American Express has linked up with Global Payments Chase has debuted a new card aimed at small businesses Green Dot is looking to a younger audience JPMorgan Chase announced that it will begin processing Chase Visa payments made at US Walmart and Sam’s Club stores, along with Sam's Club's website, through ChaseNet, the bank’s closed-loop processing network for Chase Visa cards. The partnership marks an expansion of the relationship between ChaseNet and Walmart, which was previously confined to Walmart e-commerce processing.  It’s probable that Chase Visa cards comprise a significant share of Walmart’s overall card payments. Eighty percent of US consumers prefer debit or credit cards for both in-person and online payments, according to TransFirst, which means it’s likely that a considerable amount of Walmart’s purchasing comes from payment cards. Because Chase, which issues predominantly Visa cards, is the largest US bank by assets, it’s likely that it’s the issuer of a decent share of cards used for spending at Walmart. As such, it’s likely the number of payments the partnership will cover is not insubstantial.  That makes the expansion of the partnership a major opportunity for ChaseNet. ChaseNet was already processing Walmart e-commerce payments. Last year, Walmart’s digital sales totaled $14 billion, according to Fortune. And that’s a segment that’s growing — global online sales grew nearly 12% year-over-year (YoY) in Q2 2016. But the expanded partnership gives them much more access. Walmart’s shopper traffic in-store is also growing, according to Fortune, which means ChaseNet will also get access to this population. In addition, adding Sam’s Club’s online business, which grew by46% in Q4 2015, gives ChaseNet access to another large and fast-growing revenue stream.   And it could also help lower interchange payments for Walmart, which has been a sticking point for the retailer in recent months. Walmart pays a considerable amount in card fees annually. And earlier in 2016, the retailer sued Visa over its fee structure. But for its partners, ChaseNet provides fixed-rate and often discounted interchange pricing on eligible cards, which means that Walmart would pay considerably less on any purchase made via a Chase Visa card, thereby decreasing fees on a number of purchases. That could help relieve tensions between Walmart and Visa in other areas by making fees across the board more affordable. Evan Bakker, senior research analyst for BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on payments gateways that explains what they do, the benchmarks on which they compete, their growth drivers, and the key players. It also assesses the potential for gateways to impact legacy processors.  Here are some key takeaways from the report: Payment gateways help e-commerce merchants accept online transactions. They serve as the online version of a payment terminal and front-end processor for online and mobile sellers. Gateways typically sell bundled services, including payment acceptance, data reporting, and fraud management. Gateways have an opportunity to capitalize on the growing online processing market. BI Intelligence estimates that the US online processing market — from which gateways extract some of their revenue — will be worth about $10.7 billion this year. The market will grow to $17.5 billion by 2020, driven by the increase in online shopping. As online sales rise, gateways' addressable audience — e-commerce merchants — is getting both larger and more valuable, affording gateways an opportunity to seize and compete for more potential revenue. Gateways pose threats to the old guard as more merchants embrace the online-to-offline (O2O) business model. Many of the most successful tech companies, like Uber and Airbnb, leverage an O2O model, in which customers pay for in-person goods and services digitally. With an early-mover advantage among these types of retailers, gateways might begin to displace revenue from legacy processors because they will substitute rather than complement in-store processing volume. In full, the report: Explains how gateways function and compete with each other in the payments ecosystem. Identifies the factors enabling gateways to capture long-term growth. Forecasts the size of the online and in-store processing markets to give context on the industry gateways operate within. Lists the key gateway providers and explains what makes each successful. Assesses the disruption opportunity for gateways and how this will affect legacy processors. Interested in getting the full report?

The initial public offering could raise $5 billion, Thomson Reuters publication IFR reported previously . CITIC Securities , Citigroup, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have started preparatory work, although no formal mandate has been awarded, the people said. The timing and size of the IPO are still undetermined, but the four banks are likely to land the key sponsor roles for the deal, they said, declining to be identified as the information has not been officially disclosed. Lufax, valued at $18.5 billion in a January fundraising, would be the first peer-to-peer (P2P) platform to list in Hong Kong. The IPO comes at a time of surging growth in P2P lending and will test investor appetite for a new breed of companies that threaten to disrupt the traditional financial industry. Lufax and Ping An declined to comment. CITIC CLSA, the Hong Kong investment banking unit of CITIC Securities, Citigroup and JPMorgan also declined to comment. Morgan Stanley did not offer an immediate response. Peer-to-peer platforms help link up individual or institutional investors looking to invest their cash with borrowers including small- and medium-enterprises, students and other individuals that need funding. Those companies are part of a booming financial technology (fintech) industry in China that hopes to offer a young and increasingly affluent population speedy and easy-to-use services on their mobile phones. The volume of Chinese P2P loans stood at 680.3 billion yuan ($102 billion) at the end of August, more than 20 times levels seen in January 2014, according to industry data provider Wangdaizhijia. That could swell to 880 billion yuan by the end of 2016 and to 1.5 trillion yuan by the end of 2018, according to estimates from Nomura. But P2P lending has also drawn much scrutiny from regulators. Seeking to head off rising risks in the market, Chinese authorities implemented aggressive steps including requiring borrowing limits and the use of third-party banks as custodians of investor funds in P2P platforms. The measures will probably leave China with 200-300 P2P players by this time next year from more than 4,000 now, Lufax CFO James Zheng said in late August. Lufax had over 23.3 million users at end-June, Ping An said in its first-half earnings report, more than double a year earlier. Trading volumes totalled 3.2 trillion yuan ($480 billion) over the same period, compared with 512 million yuan in the first half of 2015.

Embed from Getty Images   It isn’t easy quitting a lucrative job at JPMorgan to become a middle-aged college freshman. Bloomberg News reports that David Lim mulled the idea for seven years before he finally left the bank’s South Korea unit in February, heading back to school to start a new career as a physical therapist. For the 43-year-old father of one, the country’s shrinking financial industry and booming health-care sector made the decision to pursue his passion a little less daunting. “Because Korea is aging fast, people are growing more and more health conscious,” said Lim, who left his role in banking sales at JPMorgan to join the health sciences program at the University of Otago in New Zealand. After graduation, he plans to eventually start his own business in Korea. Lim is among a growing number of bankers turning to stronger segments of Korea’s job market as the nation’s financial industry grapples with weak profitability, tepid economic growth and rising corporate defaults.

Embed from Getty Images   Bloomberg News reports that the Fed is seeking a fine of as much as $62m from the bank, and the OCC is also seeking punishments to settle claims that a breakdown in controls resulted in JPMorgan inappropriately hiring the children of Chinese officials to win business, the people said, asking not to be identified because the talks are private. Those probes would come on top of settlements being negotiated with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors. At issue is whether the bank’s hiring of relatives of influential Chinese officials was tantamount to paying a bribe that ran afoul of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The 1977 law made it illegal to provide pay or benefits to a foreign government official. JPMorgan is expected to settle later this year with the U.S. Justice Department and SEC to end the three-year probe. The bank could pay about $200m to resolve the investigations, people familiar with the matter have said. While the Justice Department’s examination initially focused on JPMorgan, it widened to include other Wall Street firms, according to the people.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sun, Sep 25, 2016 - Page 14　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Foreign-exchange volatility down, but not for long Bloomberg and staff writer, with CNA Volatility in the US$5.1 trillion-a-day foreign-exchange market is down, but not out, UBS AG said. Currency swings are expected to increase later this year as investors weigh the potential outcome of the US presidential election and the likelihood of a US Federal Reserve year-end interest-rate increase. The predicted volatility resurgence follows a period of calm that started in July, after traders absorbed the initial shock of the UK’s Brexit vote. A JPMorgan Chase & Co gauge of currency volatility fell to a two-week low this week. “Once it gets closer to the election and the call gets closer on who will be the next president, volatility should rise from currently rather low levels,” said Constantin Bolz, a foreign-exchange strategist at UBS’s wealth management unit in Zurich. It has been a year of ups and downs for the US dollar on mixed signals from policymakers amid prospects for Fed monetary tightening. The US central bank scaled back its outlook for interest-rate increases this week, further dimming the outlook for the greenback, which has declined almost 4 percent this year. And with the US presidential election only about six weeks away, investors are speculating about what the outcome would mean for the currency market. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index, which tracks the currency against 10 major peers, dropped 0.6 percent this week as traders digested the Fed announcement and the Bank of Japan’s move to a more flexible approach to expanding stimulus. The greenback fell 1.2 percent to ￥101.02, and weakened 0.6 percent to US$1.1226 per euro. The JPMorgan Global FX Volatility Index, a gauge of expected swings in the currency market, climbed to 9.9 percent on Friday, while remaining below its 10.7 percent average this year. It has stabilized in recent months after it reaching a four-month high just before the UK decision in June to leave the EU. US Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham Clinton and US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump are to hold their first televised debate on Monday as part of the run up to the Nov. 8 election. “We have a strong view that volatility is going to pick up toward year-end,” said Douglas Borthwick, the New York-based head of currencies at Chapdelaine & Co. TAIPEI In Taipei, the New Taiwan dollar rose against the greenback on Friday, gaining NT$0.07 to close at NT$31.330 after moving in a quiet session without fresh indications for traders, dealers said. The US dollar on Friday traded in a narrow range against the Taiwan dollar, but saw some selling toward the end of the session as traders took cues from foreign institutional buying in local equities, the dealers said. The greenback opened at NT$31.400 and moved between NT$31.310 and NT$31.437 before the close. Turnover totaled US$526 million during the session. The flat opening continued within a small trading range, as many currency traders stayed on the sidelines for more clues on how to map out their investment strategies, the dealers said. After a plunge earlier this week, the US dollar became more stable on Friday, as traders settled down following the Fed’s decision, they said. Even before the decision, foreign investors had started to move funds into the region to boost the NT dollar and other regional currencies, the dealers said. Investors need more incentives to trade as they wait for more economic data from the US, they said. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1329 times. Comments will be moderated.

"What you've seen investors doing is starting to chase other asset classes in a search for yield so they've been piling into things that they perceive as safe havens," explained JPMorgan's Stephen Parker on CNBC's "Futures Now" this week. The bank's head of thematic equity solutions highlighted the recent popularity of minimum volatility exchange traded funds (ETFs). These instruments offer nervous investors the opportunity to invest in so-called safe haven stocks, such as utilities and consumer staples. However, while these sectors currently offer attractive yields in a zero interest rate world, valuations are trading well above the market. For instance, consumer staples trade at 22 times forward earnings and utilities, which historically trade at a 20 percent discount to the market, are trading at a premium. "When you think about safety, it is a reflection not just of the fundamentals, but also of the price you're paying," noted Parker. "We're telling clients to be cautious about chasing yields at this point." 'Look at the divergence' Parker went on to say that he sees signs of froth in high quality bonds and gold. Moreover, while he envisions equities and Treasuries continuing to move in tandem in the near-term, Parker eventually sees the two diverging— in spite of low rates and accommodative central banks. "You need to look for a little bit of a divergence going forward," said Parker. "If this market is going to see more meaningful upside from here you need to start to see better growth, better earnings and higher inflation," he said. "That probably means rates move higher, and that's a positive environment for stocks." Parker highlighted that, despite the gains for defensive sectors like telecom and utilities on a year-to-date basis, many investors are beginning to rotate towards more cyclical parts of the market like technology, banks and materials. "That is a vote of confidence for the fact that growth is going to continue to be modest, but positive," concluded Parker.

With the rating cut, Turkey faces difficulties in attracting the foreign capital needed to cover its current-account deficit. Published: 15:58 September 24, 2016 Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE Istanbul: Turkey’s sovereign credit rating was cut to junk by Moody’s Investor Service, which concluded a review initiated after an unsuccessful coup attempt on July 15. Moody’s cited rising risks related to Turkey’s external financing needs and a weakening in credit fundamentals as economic growth slows. The rating was cut to Ba1 from Baa3, leaving Fitch Ratings as the only major ratings company to keep Turkey at investment grade. Erdogan Doesn’t Care at All If Turkey Gets Downgraded to Junk “The risk of a sudden, disruptive reversal in foreign capital flows, a more rapid fall in reserves and, in a worst-case scenario, a balance of payments crisis has increased,” Moody’s said in an emailed statement announcing the decision late Friday. “This slow deterioration in Turkey’s credit profile will continue over the next two to three years and the balance of risks are better captured at a Ba1 rating level.” With the rating cut, the difficulties Turkey faces in attracting the foreign capital needed to cover its current-account deficit, the fourth largest in the G20 group of major economies, are likely to be compounded. The downgrade could drive forced selling of as much as $8.7 billion in Turkish bonds, JPMorgan Chase & Co said in August. Many of the world’s biggest funds require investment-grade ratings from two of the three major ratings companies — Fitch, Moody’s and S&P Global — to consider an asset for investment. Erdogan’s View The lira had weakened 0.9 per cent to 2.9689 by the close of trading at midnight in Istanbul. The currency has lost about 40 per cent of its value against the dollar since 2013, when the US. Federal Reserve announced it was phasing out its extraordinary monetary stimulus program, raising the prospect of reduced investment flows to emerging markets such as Turkey. The Moody’s cut came a day after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan criticised rating companies in an interview with Bloomberg in New York. “I don’t care at all” if they downgrade, he said, accusing the ratings companies of making decisions based on politics rather than economic fundamentals. “I’m inviting them to be honest,” he told Bloomberg. “Whether you’re honest or not, Turkey’s economy is strong in any case, it’s standing upright and it will continue to stand upright.” ‘Shock’ Risk Moody’s placed the rating on review for downgrade three days after a faction of Turkey’s military tried to overthrow Erdogan on July 15. The president blamed members of the Fethullah Gulen religious movement, and responded by declaring a three-month state of emergency that allows him to rule by decree. Thousands were arrested, and tens of thousands of suspected Gulenist sympathisers have lost their jobs. Credit markets were already treating Turkey’s debt as speculative. The cost to insure its 5-year bonds against default was 248 basis points on Friday, more than double countries that were rated the same including Slovenia and Romania, and about 40 basis points higher than junk-rated Russia. “The risk of a shock arising as a result of the country’s weak external position has become more pronounced, given the combination of persistently high political risks and volatile investor sentiment,” Moody’s said. It set the outlook as “stable,” citing Turkey’s “large and flexible economy which continues to register positive growth and the government’s strong fiscal track record.” More from Economy India wary as Beijing seeks Asia-wide trade pact 06:54 pm Eurozone economy to hum at modest pace 06:54 pm ‘Recovery still reliant on ECB policy support’ 06:54 pm Red Sea ‘megacity’ model for Saudi reforms: CEO 04:57 pm Egyptian firms to resume sugar imports 04:57 pm Yellen: Fed could raise rates ‘relatively soon’ Commodities set for rebound in 2017 US consumer prices post largest gain in 6 months tags from this storyUnited States follow this tag on MGNRecep Tayyip Erdogan follow this tag on MGNG20 follow this tag on MGNRussia follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessEconomy tagsUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNRecep Tayyip Erdogan follow this tag on MGN+ MGNG20 follow this tag on MGN+ MGNRussia follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In EconomyIndia wary as Beijing seeks Asia-wide trade pact Business Gallery Kish island turns to be a major tourism hub Pakistan, China launch new trade route Business Videos PlayStrata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosGalleries 01Job worries bog down UAE consumers: survey 02Saudi Arabia currency depeg is 'last resort' 03Shaikh Mohammad issues law on free zones Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Play Britain is open for business Sep 20, 2016 10Images Apple unveils Nike+ smartwatch Oct 29, 2016 1Image In pictures: Evolution of Emirates airline Oct 25, 2015 15Images Inside a Russian precious metals plant Oct 26, 2016 9Images In pictures: World Economic Forum 2010 Jan 28, 2010 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Retail Gold Rate Sponsored by Most Popular on Gulf News UAE announces public, private sector holidays Why expats risk fines to live in bed spaces Jailed, abused, and homeless Viral: Saudi man’s love poem to Ivanka Trump 'Utter devastation' after New Zealand quakes Data of 34 million Keralites leaked Your guide to tonight’s Supermoon Indian embassy to take up expats’ rupee concerns Best airlines to fly with in 2017 Close Recommended For You Saudi rights advocate firm in adversityPUBLISHED ON Nov 19, 2016 Truce in doubt after many die in Yemen clashesPUBLISHED ON Nov 18, 2016 Woman weds boyfriend in husband’s presencePUBLISHED ON Nov 18, 2016 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.
