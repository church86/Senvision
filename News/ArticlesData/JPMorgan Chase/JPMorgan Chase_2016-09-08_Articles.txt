Pedestrians pass in front of the JPMorgan Chase headquarters building in New York. Macquarie's David Konrad, one of the Wall Street's top analysts, lowered his rating on JPMorgan Chase to neutral from outperform, citing the stock's full valuation and slower investment banking trends. "Although we believe a premium valuation [for JPMorgan] is warranted due to better-than-peer returns with less earnings volatility, the current P/E multiple appears full relative to historical valuations," Konrad wrote in a note to clients Friday. "Although we expect continued strong loan growth and operating leverage, the interest rate environment remains a headwind for NIM and expense initiatives are largely embedded in expectations." Konrad's picks have a 29.9 percent one-year average return with a 92 percent success rate, according to analyst ranking service TipRanks, placing him in the top 10 percent of all Wall Street analysts covering any industry.

(NYSE: JPM) has moved from trading at a 19 percent discount valuation to a 7 percent premium valuation, which Macquarie’s David Konrad views a warranted, given the company’s “relatively less volatility of earnings, better-than-peer ROTCE and market share gains.” Konrad downgraded the rating on the company to Neutral, while lowering the price target from $72 to $70. Challenging Environment However, the analyst expects the interest rate environment to continue to be challenging, while cost saving expectations are mostly factored into the consensus forecasts. Related Link: Rate Hike Bets Spurred August Inflows To Financial ETFs “Moreover, a meaningfully improved ROE may be challenging with higher-than-peer required capital buffers,” Konrad mentioned. In-Line Expectations The analyst pointed out the revised estimates were now 1 percent below consensus for 2017 and 2 percent below consensus for 2018, which can be considered as relatively in line. “Although we expect continued strong loan growth and operating leverage, the interest rate environment remains a headwind for NIM and expense initiatives are largely embedded in expectations,” Konrad cautioned. Capital Distribution On the other hand, the analyst expects capital distribution to remain strong, although greater improvement is likely from some of JPMorgan Chase’s peers. The EPS estimates for 2016, 2017 and 2018 have been lowered to reflect the rate and capital market expectations. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

the limitations placed on the ability of Evolent and Valence Health to operate their respective businesses by the merger agreement; the effect of the announcement of the merger on Evolent's and Valence Health's business relationships, customers, suppliers, other partners, standing with regulators, operating results and businesses generally; the amount of any costs, fees, expenses, impairments and charges related to the merger; and the market price for our Class A common stock potentially being affected, following the merger, by factors that historically have not affected the market price for our Class A common stock; the structural change in the market for health care in the United States; our ability to effectively manage our growth; the significant portion of revenue we derive from our largest partners; our ability to offer new and innovative products and services;

our future indebtedness and our ability to obtain additional financing; our ability to achieve profitability in the future; the requirements of being a public company; our adjusted results may not be representative of our future performance;

our intention not to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock; and our status as an "emerging growth company." The risks included here are not exhaustive.  Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, level of activity, performance or achievements.  Our 2015 Form 10-K and other documents filed with the SEC include additional factors that could affect our businesses and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors. Further, it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, we disclaim any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.

Chase has run out of the alloy, whose composition is a trade secret. AP High-end, high-fee, high-reward credit card is the hottest thing out there Sep 9, 2016 (…) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS The Chase Sapphire Reserve Card from JPMorgan Chase is made of a metallic alloy. Chase has run out of the alloy, whose composition is a trade secret. NEW YORK (AP) — The demand has been so overwhelming that the manufacturer ran out of raw material in just a few days. Enthusiasts extol its virtues all over the Internet. Millennials are clamoring for it. It’s not a new video game, or some fancy food craze, or even Apple’s latest iPhone, but a credit card. Calling it plastic wouldn’t do it justice. It is a high-end, high-fee, high-reward card made of a metallic alloy that gives it a satisfying heft and an impressive thunk when you toss it onto the table to pick up the check. The Chase Sapphire Reserve Card has become the hottest card on the market just two weeks after being introduced, even though it came out during the slow, end-of-summer period, it carries a hefty $450 annual fee, and JPMorgan Chase spent nothing on advertising it. “I’m telling all my friends about it,” said Maddy Novich, 33, of New York, who applied for the card, as did her husband. “I have never seen such interest in a credit card, and I’ve been doing this for 15 years,” said Gary Leff, who runs the travel and points blog View From the Wing. Chase has approved tens of thousands of applications for the card, said spokeswoman Lauren Francis. Most of the customers are millennials, who typically shun credit cards and are not usually a target for high-fee, ultra-premium plastic. The demand has been so high that Chase ran out of the alloy, whose composition is a trade secret. Customers are being issued temporary plastic cards. “We quickly ordered more, but because they are handcrafted, they take more time to make,” said Lisa Walker, general manager of Chase’s Sapphire credit card program. Credit cards with high fees but generous rewards are aimed at well-to-do customers who spend and travel extensively. The market has long been dominated by American Express with its Platinum Card. So why is the Chase card so hot? Chase offers a 100,000-point sign-up bonus if the customer meets certain spending targets. Those points can be worth up to $1,500 in travel rewards. They can also be converted to hotel or airline points that could secure, oh, a dreamy hotel suite in the Maldives or a first-class ticket for a honeymoon. The card also comes with a $300 annual credit toward travel, which effectively makes the annual fee $150. It has a generous points-earning program, with triple points on travel and dining, and gives access to airport lounges. “It’s one of the best offers I’ve ever seen. With the amount of travel and dining we do, I saw it as a worthwhile card to get,” Novich said. The card’s metal composition is also clearly part of the appeal. Only a handful of other credit cards are metal, including the American Express Centurion Card, commonly known as the AmEx “black card,” which is typically available only to millionaires, billionaires and celebrities. Kayla Kania, 33, a manager at an accounting firm from Rockville, Maryland, proudly posted a picture of her new Chase card on Instagram and said she has received compliments about it from cashiers and a co-worker. “The metal part of it, people get excited about it. It’s weird,” she said.

After a routine State Council meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on Monday, the cabinet said it had decided to improve weak links in the economy by accelerating key infrastructure projects and encouraging private investment. Private investment proving to be Chinese economy’s Achilles’ heel To Goldman, it was a signal of renewed easing. The firm’s economists, led by Yu Song and MK Tang, wrote in a note dated September 6 that the statement “sent out a clear signal of another round of policy loosening”. Meanwhile at JPMorgan, economists led by Grace Ng and Haibin Zhu, said two days later that the policy stance “will unlikely become more expansionary”. The different views between the two leading investment banks reflect the growing difficulty in forecasting the pace and degree of China’s policy moves, despite Beijing’s general pro-growth position. China has said repeatedly that it will maintain prudent monetary policy and proactive fiscal policy, but the general statements are losing relevance in a rapidly evolving economy which is forcing observers to try to squeeze meaning out bureaucratic jargon. For Goldman Sachs’ China economists, which also include Zhennan Li and Maggie Wei, the 1,070-character statement on Monday, together with Beijing’s decision to send “inspection teams” to whip local cadres into line on investment, “are important signals that the government intends to loosen cyclical policy for the second time this year”. The initial round was in the first quarter when Chinese banks pumped in an unprecedented amount of credit to aid growth. China’s state agencies struggle to coordinate policies in bid to boost slowing growth However, their counterparts at JPMorgan, including Marvin Chen, said the message from Monday’s meeting was merely to dispel concern that fiscal support would dissipate. “The government … is aiming to maintain largely stable fiscal support for the rest of the year, though the policy stance will unlikely become more expansionary in our view,” they wrote. But one thing is clear: the central government is ditching big-bang measures such as all-out fiscal stimulus, opting for more targeted economic management. For instance, the central bank has steered away from headline-grabbing cuts to interest rates and bank reserve ratios, preferring instead to make lower-profile day-to-day moves in the interbank market to influence interest rates and available funding. Chinese consumer jitters point to rocky economic ride ahead And it could just be working. After a slew of weak economic indicators from investment to bank lending in July, the purchasing managers’ index, a measure of factory activity, surged to a near two-year high in August, while imports also recorded the first monthly growth in August since October 2014, reflecting improved domestic demand.

Enthusiasts extol its virtues all over the internet. Millennials are clamoring for it. It's not a new video game, or some fancy food craze, or even Apple's latest iPhone, but a credit card. Calling it plastic wouldn't do it justice. It is a high-end, high-fee, high-reward card made of a metallic alloy that gives it a satisfying heft and an impressive thunk when you toss it onto the table to pick up the check. This photo provided by JPMorgan Chase shows a likeness of the bank's newest credit card, the Chase Sapphire Reserve Card. The card has become the hottest credit card on the market after being available only two weeks, to the point of running out of the metal cards used to make it. (JPMorgan Chase via AP) The Chase Sapphire Reserve Card has become the hottest card on the market just two weeks after being introduced, even though it came out during the slow, end-of-summer period, it carries a hefty $450 annual fee, and JPMorgan Chase spent nothing on advertising it. "I'm telling all my friends about it," said Maddy Novich, 33, of New York, who applied for the card, as did her husband. Like so many crazes these days, this one has been fueled by social media, word of mouth and the internet. Frequent travelers and those who try to game travel-loyalty programs have been writing extensively about the card on blogs and forums. "I have never seen such interest in a credit card, and I've been doing this for 15 years," said Gary Leff, who runs the travel and points blog View From the Wing . Chase has approved tens of thousands of applications for the card, said spokeswoman Lauren Francis. Most of the customers are millennials, who typically shun credit cards and are not usually a target for high-fee, ultra-premium plastic. The demand has been so high that Chase ran out of the alloy, whose composition is a trade secret. Customers are being issued temporary plastic cards. "We quickly ordered more, but because they are handcrafted, they take more time to make," said Lisa Walker, general manager of Chase's Sapphire credit card program. Credit cards with high fees but generous rewards are aimed at well-to-do customers who spend and travel extensively. The market has long been dominated by American Express with its Platinum Card. So why's the Chase card so hot? Chase offers a 100,000-point sign-up bonus if the customer meets certain spending targets. Those points can be worth up to $1,500 in travel rewards. They can also be converted to hotel or airline points that could secure, oh, a dreamy hotel suite in the Maldives or a first-class ticket for, say, a honeymoon. The card also comes with a $300 annual credit toward travel, which effectively makes the annual fee really $150. It has a generous points-earning program, with triple points on travel and dining, and gives access to airport lounges. "It's one of the best offers I've ever seen. With the amount of travel and dining we do, I saw it as a worthwhile card to get," Novich said. The card's metal composition is also clearly part of the appeal. Only a handful of other credit cards are metal, including the American Express Centurion Card, commonly known as the AmEx "black card," which is typically available only to millionaires, billionaires and celebrities. Kayla Kania, a 33-year-old manager at an accounting firm from Rockville, Maryland, proudly posted a picture of her new Chase card on Instagram and said she has received compliments about it from cashiers and a co-worker.

Andrés Cardenal (TMFacardenal) Sep 8, 2016 at 9:21AM Image source: Getty Images. MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) stock received a massive upgrade last week, as JPMorgan promoted the company from neutral to overweight and raised its price target by more than 50%, from $133 to $200 per share. MercadoLibre stock is trading above $186 per share as of the time of this writing, so JP Morgan's price target is only 7.5% above the current price.  Since MercadoLibre stock has gained over 60% year to date, we could say that the recommendation comes behind the curve. However, the research note from JPMorgan highlights the fact that growth is accelerating, and this is a major positive for investors in the company. MercadoLibre is gaining steam As a general rule, growth tends to slow down as a company gains size and market penetration levels increase over the years. This is just a natural phenomenon in the business world, since sustaining rapid growth in percentage terms is relatively easier when the business is still young and the revenue base is small. In MercadoLibre's particular case, the company operates 100% in Latin America, and many countries in the region are struggling with economic instability lately.  However, you wouldn't have guessed that by looking at MercadoLibre's financial reports for the second quarter of 2016. Not only is the business firing on all cylinders, but growth is even accelerating under challenging conditions.  Items sold in the company's e-commerce platform reached 43.7 million units during the second quarter of 2016, an increase of 44.7% versus the same period one year ago. This is the fastest growth rate that MercadoLibre has reported since 2009. Different indicators across the board are pointing in the same direction. Gross merchandise volume reached more than $2 billion last quarter, a 21.2% increase in U.S. dollars and growing 67.9% in local currencies. Total revenue amounted to $199.6 million, an annual increase of 29.4% in U.S. dollars and a 72.5% jump in local currencies.  MercadoLibre owns a digital payments platform called MercadoPago, and performance in this business looks stronger than ever. Total payment transactions were 31.9 million last quarter, a 76% increase versus the second quarter in 2015. Total payment volume reached $1.8 billion, growing 50.6% in dollars and 101.6% in local currencies. MercadoPago's on-platform penetration reached a record high of 75% last quarter, almost 20% points higher than in the second quarter of 2015. Brazil is MercadoLibre's biggest market, and its economy has been under considerable pressure over the past several years. According to estimates from OECD, Brazil's GDP is expected to contract by 4.3% in 2016, while inflation is forecasted to be in the area of 9.2% during the year.   In spite of these difficulties, MercadoLibre is producing record performance in this key market, and this is one of the main reasons why JPMorgan upgraded the stock. According to analyst Andre Baggio, as quoted by Barron's: MercadoLibre's best performing operation is Brazil, despite being its largest and likely most penetrated market, signaling that e-commerce is still at initial stages, given 4% of retail penetration. Revenue growth in the country reached 61% year-over-year, reaching one of the highest levels on disclosed record, which we attribute to increased confidence from Brazilian consumers on e-commerce and marketplace platforms in general. Moving forward MercadoLibre is the undisputed market leader in all of the main countries where it operates, and the company is consolidating its competitive position on the back of brand recognition generating customer trust. Besides, an expanding ecosystem of services in areas such as payments, shipping, and advertising make the platform increasingly valuable to both buyers and sellers. The economy in Latin America tends to be particularly unstable, but the e-commerce industry is gaining acceptance among customers, and growth is accelerating. Management calculates that nearly 9.9% of all retail sales in the U.S. will happen online in 2016, while the number is a much lower 3% in Latin America. This indicates that the Latin America e-commerce industry should be fertile ground for growth going forward, and no company is better positioned than MercadoLibre to profit from such opportunity.  MercadoLibre stock is aggressively priced in terms of current earnings, but valuation doesn't look too excessive when factoring growth into the equation. In terms of PEG ratio, which measures price-to-earnings ratio adjusted by growth expectations, MercadoLibre looks, in fact, cheaper than bigger industry players such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).  Looking at the table below, the Latin American player looks fairly priced versus Amazon and eBay, and its market value still has room to run. Company Market Cap  P/E Ratio 5-Year Expected Growth Rate PEG Ratio MercadoLibre $7.68 billion 62.9 24.3% 2.6 Amazon $373.1 billion 196.7 50.6% 3.9 eBay $36.42 billion 19.4 5.7% 3.4 Data source: FinViz.  In a nutshell, MercadoLibre is gaining steam in spite of growing market penetration and difficult economic conditions in Latin America. The stock is priced for demanding expectations, but its valuation doesn't seem unreasonable for such a promising growth business. With this in mind, it's not too hard to understand why Wall Street analysts are increasingly bullish on MercadoLibre stock. Andrés Cardenal owns shares of Amazon.com and MercadoLibre.

 JPMorgan just made two big promotions in a key trading business Matt Turner Sep. 7, 2016, 11:15 AM 6,040 facebook linkedin twitter email print JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon. Thomson Reuters JPMorgan has announced two new coheads of its equities business, following the departure of Tim Throsby to Barclays. The bank announced today that Mark Leung and Jason Sippel would become global coheads of equities, effective immediately. They will also manage the prime services business, which caters to hedge funds, with James Kenny. They will also join the corporate and investment bank management team. Both Leung and Sippel are longtime JPMorgan employees. Leung joined JPMorgan in 1997 and went through the bank's markets training program. He was most recently head of the equities business in Asia Pacific. Sippel has been with the bank for 14 years and was most recently global head of prime services, having previously headed Americas equities. JPMorgan has made its equities business a key focus in recent years. The bank finished 2015 ranked third for equities revenues, according to data from the analytics firm Coalition. That compares with a No. 1 ranking in fixed income, currencies and commodities, and investment banking. Cash equities, or stock trading, was the one business line in which the bank did not have a top-three ranking in 2015. "We are positioned incredibly well and yet, we still see more opportunities for us to invest and grow," Daniel Pinto, CEO of the corporate and investment bank, said in a memo announcing the changes.

Checking for new content Loading new content Democracy Now! HOME TOPICS DONATE Fri Sep 9, 2016 Who Is Funding the Dakota Access Pipeline? Bank of America, HSBC, UBS, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo Watch Listen 09m 32s We continue our conversation Food & Water Watch’s Hugh MacMillan about his new investigation that reveals the dozens of financial institutions that are bankrolling the Dakota Access pipeline, including Bank of America, HSBC, UBS, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase. "They are banking on this company and banking on being able to drill and frack for the oil to send through the pipeline over the coming decades," MacMillan says. "So they’re providing the capital for the construction of this pipeline." AMY GOODMAN: Juan, in a moment we’re going to be talking about the Attica prison uprising, but right now we’re going to be looking at the banks and who is funding the $3.8 billion pipeline, the Dakota Access pipeline. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, we’ll continue to—on Wednesday in Minneapolis—what we want to do is continue to cover the coverage of the standoff at Standing Rock over the $3.8 billion Dakota Access pipeline with a look at who is profiting off of it. On Wednesday in Minneapolis, dozens protested at U.S. Bank Plaza, demanding U.S. Bank stop funding the pipeline. According to an investigation published by LittleSis, U.S. Bank has extended a $175 million credit line to Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the pipeline. AMY GOODMAN: Meanwhile, Saturday was the first day of a two-week call for actions against the financial institutions that are bankrolling the Dakota Access pipeline project. We turn to Part 2 of our conversation with Hugh MacMillan, a senior researcher with Food & Water Watch whose new investigation reveals the dozens of financial institutions that are bankrolling what’s called DAPL, the Dakota Access pipeline. I began by asking Hugh what’s most important to understand about the corporate structure of the pipeline company. HUGH MACMILLAN: Dakota Access, LLC, is a joint venture of Phillips 66 and a joint venture of two members of the Energy Transfer family—Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics. Enbridge and Marathon Oil have bought into this, this joint venture. Together, they now have about a 37 percent stake in the pipeline, in the Dakota Access pipeline. AMY GOODMAN: How are the banks involved? HUGH MACMILLAN: Well, that’s—they are banking on this company and banking on being able to drill and frack for the oil to send through the pipeline over the coming decades. So they’re providing the capital for the construction of this pipeline. AMY GOODMAN: And explain what the banks are. Which banks are they? And how are they involved? HUGH MACMILLAN: Well, I’ve got a list of the 17 banks that are specifically providing financing for this project. And it’s also coupled together with a Energy Transfer—Energy Transfer Partner project to convert an existing pipeline that would connect to the south end of the Dakota Access pipeline and run oil all the way down to the Gulf Coast, where there are refineries and also export infrastructure. AMY GOODMAN: Can you tell us that list of 17 banks? HUGH MACMILLAN: I can. Citibank is the bank that’s been running the books on the project, and that’s the bank that beat the bushes and got other banks to join in. So, we have Wells Fargo, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Mizuho Bank, TD Securities, ABN AMRO Capital, DNB First Bank—and that’s actually a bank based in Philly; it’s not the DNB Bank based in Norway, which is actually provided several hundred million to the Energy Transfer family separately—and ICBC London, SMBC Nikko Securities and Société Générale. AMY GOODMAN: Now, it’s Citibank—is that right?—that’s running the books, as the report points out, for Energy Transfer and Sunoco Logistics, which own the Dakota Access pipeline? HUGH MACMILLAN: That’s right, by and large. So they have the largest share, and they’ve spearheaded the effort. So, what we published in LittleSis was the 30-plus banks that have provided general financing for Sunoco Logistics and Energy Transfer Partners. Through working with Rainforest Action Network, we were able to—who has access to Bloomberg Terminal, we were able to determine these 17 banks that I just listed, who are providing the direct financing for the Dakota Access project and, in addition, for an Energy Transfer Partners project to extend this pipeline on down to Texas. So, collectively, this pipeline would run from near the Canadian border on down to the Gulf Coast of Texas over 1,800 miles. AMY GOODMAN: I was just talking to an oil trucker in the plane back from North Dakota, and he trucks from the Bakken fields to other areas of North Dakota, just locally. And he said it is stunning to see the drop in demand for oil just in this past year. He has been trucking for four years. What about this decline in demand and what this will mean? HUGH MACMILLAN: Well, you know, if you ask Morgan Stanley, they said a year ago that the oil producers are getting into prison shape—and without irony. So, you know, this is a long-term—these are long-term investments from the banks. There’s fully the—they fully expect the United States to maximize its production of oil and gas through widespread fracking. AMY GOODMAN: What do you mean, "prison shape"? HUGH MACMILLAN: Well, I have a note here. They explain that "Some prisoners"—and I quote—"contrive clever equipment in workouts that result in fitness levels that surpass the traditional gym shape." And so they’re speaking in—they’re drawing an analogy to prisoners getting in good shape, drawing an analogy from that to oil and gas companies, fracking companies, learning how to do things more cheaply and more efficiently. AMY GOODMAN: So, Hugh MacMillan, as we wrap up, what do you think is most important for people to understand about the corporate structure of the company, Dakota Access pipeline, that is building the Dakota Access pipeline? HUGH MACMILLAN: Well, I think it’s important to see the forces behind this particular pipeline as the same forces behind numerous other pipelines across the country, both for—both to support fracking for tight oil as well as fracking for shale gas, all toward maximizing production of oil and gas, when the science is clear that we need to maximize what we keep in the ground. Our current policy has not made that switch. And if you look at the Department of Energy’s Quadrennial Technology Review published a year ago, you’ll see, under clean energy technologies, permeability manipulation is included, along with improved understanding of well integrity and improved understanding of injections and how they’re causing earthquakes, such as occurred over the weekend. The Quadrennial— AMY GOODMAN: In Oklahoma. HUGH MACMILLAN: That’s right, in Oklahoma. The Quadrennial Technology Review speaks of a future mastery of the subsurface toward maximizing production. AMY GOODMAN: Hugh MacMillan, senior researcher with Food & Water Watch. His new investigation reveals the dozens of financial institutions that are bankrolling the Dakota Access pipeline.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 09, 2016 9:45am   Comments Share: Related CHK Benzinga's Top Upgrades 20 Biggest Mid-Day Gainers For Thursday Chesapeake Energy sells Utica acreage, wells to Ohio company (Seeking Alpha) Citing an improved financial position and maintained strong operations, Wunderlich has upgraded Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE: CHK) to Buy from Hold and raised its target by $4 to $10. "We believe as the company continues this process, it can exhibit production growth, higher cash flows and multiple expansion. In fact, we believe there are multiple potential catalysts for CHK that can drive its stock higher," analyst Jason Wangler wrote in a note. Debt Concerns And Tailwinds Further, the ongoing better commodity environment and financial markets provide further tailwinds to the company's operations. Chesapeake updated commentary shows forecasted annual production growth of 5–15 percent from 2016–2020. Related Link: Director Dunham Buys 350,000 Shares Of Chesapeake Energy At $6.07/Shares -Form 4 Wangler expects Chesapeake is likely to see an inflection point in production mid-2017, bringing back the company to growth path while still spending at a prudent level. In addition, the planned asset divestitures and the ongoing tender offer for multiple tranches of debt should not just aid in reducing the overall debt level, but should also cut further into its 2017 maturities. Chesapeake has been able to lower its potential 2017 debt from $2.2 billion in 2015 to an estimated $660 million at this point in time. Currently, Chesapeake has about $3.9 billion in liquidity between cash-on-hand and its credit facility, which can help fund any outspend. "We believe CHK's balance sheet should improve further with the results from its ongoing tender offers that should be finalized next week and look for even more incremental data from its newly scheduled analyst day next month, which could further define upcoming opportunities," Wangler added. Looking Forward The analyst's current per share estimates are $(0.30) for 2016 and $0.57 for 2017. Wangler sees cash flow per share of $1.15 for 2016 and $1.87 for 2017. Furthermore, he expects Chesapeake to generate positive cash flows of around $1.0 billion in 2016, cash flow negative by about $500 million in 2017 and cash flow neutrality in 2018. Shares of Chesapeake rose 13.66 percent Thursday to close trading at $7.74. In the pre-market hours on Friday, they fell 1.94 percent to $7.59. Within 10 minutes of the regular trading session, Chesapeake was seen at $7.69, down 0.65 percent on the day. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro.

MARKET COMMENTS Sep E-mini S&Ps (ESU16 -0.30%) this morning are down -5.50 points (-0.25%). Thursday's closes: S&P 500 -0.22%, Dow Jones -0.25%, Nasdaq -0.58%. The S&P 500 on Thursday closed lower on disappointment that the ECB did not expand stimulus measures at its policy meeting. Stocks recovered from their worst levels as energy producer stocks rallied after crude oil surged +4.66% to a 1-week high. Dec 10-year T-notes (ZNZ16 -0.10%) this morning are down -3 ticks. Thursday's closes: TYZ6 -20.50, FVZ6 -11.50. Dec T-notes on Thursday closed lower on the unexpected drop in U.S. weekly jobless claims to a 7-week low and on disappointment that the ECB did not expand QE. There were also increased inflation expectations after the 10-year T-note breakeven inflation rate rose to a 2-1/2 month high. The dollar index (DXY00 -0.04%) this morning is up +0.020 (+0.02%). EUR/USD (^EURUSD) is up +0.0003 (+0.03%). USD/JPY (^USDJPY) is up +0.19 (+0.19%). Thursday's closes: Dollar index +0.071 (+0.07%), EUR/USD +0.0021 (+0.19%), USD/JPY +0.75 (+0.74%). The dollar index on Thursday recovered from a 2-week low and closed higher on signs of U.S. labor market strength that may prompt the Fed to raise interest rates after U.S. weekly jobless claims unexpectedly fell to a 7-week low. Another hawkish factor for Fed policy was the increase in the 10-year inflation breakeven rate to a 2-1/2 month high due to the sharp +4.66% rally in oil prices. The dollar was undercut by the rally in EUR/USD to a 2-week high after the ECB refrained from addtional stimulus measures at its policy meeting. Oct crude oil (CLV16 -1.24%) this morning is down -66 cents (-1.39%) and Oct gasoline (RBV16 -1.98%) is down -0.0324 (-2.29%). Thursday's closes: CLV6 +2.12 (+4.66%), RBV6 +0.0701 (+5.21%). Oct crude oil and gasoline on Thursday rallied to 1-week highs and closed sharply higher. Crude oil prices were boosted by the -14.51 million bbl plunge in EIA crude inventories to a 6-1/2 month low (the biggest decline since Jan 1999) and the -4.21 million bbl decline in EIA gasoline stockpiles to an 8-1/4 month low, more than expectations of -750,000 bbl.

AMD also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 15 million additional Shares at the public offering price and up to $105 million principal amount of additional New Notes. AMD estimates that the net proceeds from the issuance and sale of the Shares and the New Notes (the "Net Proceeds") will be approximately $1.26 billion after deducting the underwriters' discounts and estimated offering expenses.

(Michael Nagle/Bloomberg News) As the economy improves, more people are landing jobs and using traditional bank accounts, a new survey shows. The share of consumers who were unbanked fell faster than expected last year to 7 percent, down from 7.7 percent in 2013, according to a new report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. That percentage has been dropping since it peaked at 8.2 percent in 2011 and is now the lowest it has been since the survey was started in 2009. Consumers were defined as being unbanked if no one in their household had a bank account. The FDIC also looked at the underbanked, meaning that someone in the household had a bank account but that the person still turned to nontraditional — and sometimes costly — financial services, such as payday loans, pawn shops or auto title loans. About 1 in 5 consumers said they were underbanked last year, about the same as in 2013. Consumers across income brackets and racial groups became more likely to have bank accounts over the past couple of years. African American households that are unbanked drop to 18.2 percent last year from 20.6 percent in 2013. Among Hispanic households, the rate dropped to 16.2 percent from 17.9 percent. One exception was Asian households, which saw the share of unbanked nearly double to 4 percent in 2015 from 2.2. percent in 2013. Even households with incomes below $15,000 a year, who are typically less likely to have bank accounts, saw their unbanked rate drop “significantly” to 25.6 percent in 2015 from 27.7 percent in 2013. The share of households that are unbanked dropped almost across the board in 2015 from 2013. One exception was Asian households, which saw a slight increase in the unbanked. (Courtesy of the FDIC) It’s unclear exactly why there was such a strong increase in the share of people with bank accounts. The FDIC is still studying the reasons why different groups are more or less likely to be unbanked, Chairman Martin Gruenberg said in prepared remarks. More details will be released with the full report in October. But generally speaking, the decline among the unbanked is partly the result of a more robust economy. One-third of the people who opened bank accounts over the past year said that the move was connected to a new job or because they wanted to have their checks deposited directly into their accounts. “Many households enter and exit the banking system for job-related reasons,” Gruenberg said. People who have lost their jobs or who saw a sudden drop in income are less likely to have a bank account, as are people with unsteady paychecks, the report found. Four percent of households with stable pay that earned between $30,000 and $50,000 a year lacked bank accounts. The share more than doubled to 9.5 percent for households with similar earnings but irregular paychecks, the report found.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 08, 2016 2:05pm   Comments Share: Related EMB EM Bond ETFs Are Still Attractive iShares EM ETFs Are Raking In Cash Emerging Markets React Strongly To Trump Victory (Seeking Alpha) Exchange-traded funds holding emerging market bonds, including the iShares JPMorgan USD Emer Mkt Bnd Fd ETF (NYSE: EMB), have had the wind at their backs this year, as the Federal Reserve has held off on raising interest rates, suppressing the dollar in the process. Contextual Backdrop The case for the dollar-denominated debt held by EMB and rival ETFs is bolstered in the a “lower for longer” environment, because emerging market bonds denominated in dollars have previously proven sensitive to rising Treasury yields. Related Link: A Marvelous Multi-Factor ETF Importantly, there are other factors at play bolstering the case for emerging market bond ETFs that extend beyond tempting yields and the Fed not raising rates. While ETFs such as EMB are often beholden to external factors such as Fed policy and dollar strength, improving domestic fundamentals in some developing economies help matters. Economic Growth And EMB, Peers “Emerging market economic growth managed to hang on to much of its momentum over August according to the latest release of the IHS Markit Emerging Market Composite PMI index. The August reading indicated that emerging market economies stayed in expansion territory for the third month in a row for the first time since the spring of last year,” said Markit in a recent note. “Growth in developed economies, while still in expansion territory, continued to be challenged with the current pace of expansion materially lower than the pace seen at the turn of the year.” Some of EMB's largest country allocations, including the Philippines and Indonesia, show expanding economies. Russia, on the other hand, as the ETF's third-largest geographic weight, is working its way out of its worst post-Soviet era recession. The rush to emerging markets bonds have the asset class sporting equity-like returns this year. Year-to-date, EMB is up 15.3 percent, which trails the MSCI Emerging Markets Index by 230 basis points, but the bond ETF has been only a quarter a volatile as the widely followed developing world equity benchmark. Yield Of course, yield is also motivating investors to embrace ETFs like EMB. EMB has a 30-day SEC yield of 4.38 percent, far superior to what investors will find on most developed world sovereigns. That likely explains why EMB has added $4.3 billion in new assets this year, a total exceeded by just two other fixed income ETFs. “Strong returns delivered by sovereign EM bonds has knocked over 110bps off the asset class’ yield ytd, which is nearly twice the tightening seen by US Treasuries bonds over the same period of time. These plunging yields mean that US investors are now receiving 2.9 percent of extra yield by parking their money in dollar denominated EM sovereigns, which is roughly 20bps less than the average extra yield delivered by the trade in the six years since the Markit iBoxx USD Emerging Markets Sovereigns launched in 2010,” added Markit.

"Following" : "Follow"}} September 08, 2016 1:14pm   Comments Share: Related LLY 10 Notable Stocks Trading Ex-Dividend Friday, November 11 Biotech Is Getting A Big Boost Following Clinton's Loss Amgen On Track For 2018 Migraine-Drug Launch, Beating 'Crowded Field' (Investor's Business Daily) JPMorgan has upgraded Eli Lilly and Co (NYSE: LLY) to Overweight from Neutral based on the potential for new product driven upside to estimates in 2017 and beyond. The brokerage's bullish thesis also reflects a favorable risk/reward for solanezumab data in Alzheimer patients late this year. Notably, Lilly modified the study to include only a cognitive endpoint (ADAS-Cog14) as its primary endpoint, moving the more challenging function endpoint (ADCS-iADL) to a secondary earlier this year. "While the FDA recommends both cognitive and function endpoints for Alzheimer's drug approvals, we would not be surprised to see a positive cognitive endpoint and a trend towards functional benefit ultimately being sufficient for approval," analyst Chris Schott wrote in a note. Outcomes And Probabilities The analyst sees more than 15 percent upside in the stock if EXP-3 study meets both primary and secondary endpoints, which he states are between a 10–20 percent probability. The analyst expects a more muted 10 percent upside if the study hits on its primary but only shows a trend on secondary endpoints (50–60 percent probability). Further, Schott predicts a 10 percent drop in stock if the study fails both endpoints (about 30 percent probability). Moreover, irrespective of the outcome of solanezumab, Schott sees a diverse range of new product opportunities supporting Eli Lilly's greater than 5 percent top-line growth target. Related Link: Apple, Eli Lilly, U.S. Steel: Fast Money Picks For September 7 The analyst forecast about 6 percent top-line growth through 2020, with about 5 percent excluding risk adjusted solanezumab sales. The analyst's sales growth target is also supported by a number of $1+ billion product opportunities such as Trulicity, Jardiance, Taltz, baricitinib and abemaciclib. "In aggregate, we forecast recent/upcoming new product launches to generate $11.4 billion in sales by 2020," Schott highlighted. Driven by healthy top-line growth, the analyst also projects significant margin expansion over the next several years and predicts margins of about 32 percent by 2020 versus about 22.5 percent estimated in 2016. As a result, Schott anticipates annual EPS growth of about 16 percent though 2020. At time of writing, shares of Lilly rose 1.57 percent to $79.82, while the analyst raised his price target by $3 to $95 (implying 21 percent upside potential over last close).

(AFP PHOTO / DANIEL ROLAND/AFP/Getty Images) (Photo: DANIEL ROLAND, AFP/Getty Images) The U.S. government is reportedly nearing a deal with Deutsche Bank that would force the German financial giant to pay a multibillion-dollar fine to settle allegations that it peddled risky residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) to investors, according to media reports, citing an initial report in a German-based magazine. If the reports are true Deutsche Bank would be the latest global bank to settle allegations it packaged, marketed and sold risky mortgage-backed securities during the run-up to the financial crisis without providing proper disclosures to buyers. Generally speaking, many such loans proved to be riskier than advertised to buyers, and ultimately helped spark the 2008 financial crisis. Other major banks, including U.S. firms Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Bank of America, have already agreed to multibillion-dollar settlements. When contacted by USA TODAY, Deutsche Bank spokesman Troy Gravitt decline to comment. USA TODAY has yet to confirm any details of the alleged settlement. Deutsche Bank (DB) shares rallied 3.2% Friday on the news to close at $15.26 but are still down nearly 37% for the year. The stock jump Friday was likely due to investors getting signs of resolution as it relates to the bank's RMBS liability. The German magazine Manager Magazin said the DOJ sometime next week is expected to send a 100-page document to Deutsche Bank that would outline the list of violations, name employees at fault and specify the size of the fine required to settle the long-running dispute, according to the story published on the magazine’s Web page. The German magazine said Germany’s biggest bank could be fined more than the $2.38 billion tab that U.S.-based bank Goldman Sachs paid earlier this year to settle similar allegations. The sizable fine would be the latest hit to Deutsche Bank, which has been dogged by financial weakness and regulatory scrutiny for years. The bank has been hit more recently by steep losses, the fallout from Britain’s vote to exit the European Union and the move to negative interest rates by the European Central Bank. Its U.S. unit also failed U.S. regulators’ latest bank stress tests. Last month, the troubled bank said it would close 188 of its 723 German bank branches next year and cut 3,000 jobs in a cost-cutting move. In July Chief Executive John Cryan said he hoped to close the four largest remaining litigation cases this year, which includes the RMBS case, according to Reuters.

"The Fed is clearly on a choreographed path; it wants to raise rates this year," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities. "What the market is trying to re-calibrate is whether that means September or December." "You've also had some lingering disappointment from Mario Draghi disappointing," he said. The Dow Jones industrial average closed nearly 400 points lower, with 3M and Boeing contributing the most losses. The index also posted its biggest single day fall since June 24 and its worst week since January. "The commentary from a voting member that the Fed may be forced to raise rates is important," said Kim Forrest, senior equity analyst at Fort Pitt Capital. "I think the market needs to understand that there may be a rate hike coming. Whether it's September or December, it doesn't matter big picture." "I think this is a good opportunity to take a hard look at your portfolio and maybe re-position as the market trends a bit lower," said Rob Bartenstein, CEO of Kestra Private Wealth Services. "This part of the year historically has 20-to-25 percent more volatility than any other time of the year." He added, however, he thinks stocks should finish the year on a high note. Getty Images A trader on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. The S&P 500 fell 2.45 percent, with telecommunications and utilities shedding more than 3 percent. The index also posted its first 1 percent move since July 8, as well as its biggest one-day fall since June 24. "I think this might be the beginning of a correction," said Chuck Self, CIO of iSectors. "When you look at the sectors, it's a decently broad decline." He added that Monday "could be a pretty ugly day as well" since stocks were on track to end the week on a negative note. "Intraday support has been violated, which increases risk of downside follow-through today. We believe September will be characterized by a healthy pullback, true to its seasonal influences," Katie Stockton, chief technical strategist at BTIG, said in a note to clients. The Nasdaq composite dropped about 135 points, or 2.54 percent, as the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB) fell 3.26 percent and Apple slid 2.26 percent. The Nasdaq also posted its worst day since June 24. "I think the key thing here is Eric Rosengren's speech," said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds. "I think they are trying to box themselves into a corner where they have to raise rates in September in order to maintain credibility." "If the market does sell off in anticipation of a rate hike, I think it will recover pretty quickly," Kelly added, noting a rate hike would ultimately be seen as a vote of confidence for the economy. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said in a speech low interest rates are increasing the chance of overheating the U.S. economy. Gradually tightening monetary policy is appropriate to maintaining full employment, he added. "Voting member Eric Rosengren, historically a dove, repeated his desire (was hawkish two weeks ago) for a rate hike notwithstanding the soft data over the past week," Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, said in a note to clients. "Bottom line, this is important because here we have is a voting member, a dove and someone that is calling for a rate hike even after the recent string of weak economic data." U.S. stock futures extended losses following Rosengren's speech, with Dow futures falling more than 100 points. S&P and Nasdaq futures fell 11 points and 28 points, respectively. Meanwhile, Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo — also a voting member of the Fed's policymaking committee — told CNBC he wanted to see more evidence of inflation before raising rates. Dallas Fed President Rob Kaplan, a nonvoting member of the Fed's committee, said in another speech the case for a rate hike has strengthened in the past few months. Also, Fed Governor Lael Brainard unexpectedly announced she'd deliver a speech Monday. Investors have been closely listening to Fed officials and looking at economic data, trying to gauge when the Fed might raise rates. Market expectations for a rate hike this month were 24 percent on Friday, up from 18 percent Thursday, according to the CME Group's FedWatch tool. That said, U.S. stocks have continued to hold in their recently tight range. The S&P 500 had gone 43 straight sessions without closing 1 percent higher or lower as of Thursday's close. JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade, said "I think people might overreact to this move on the S&P because they haven't seen a 1 percent move in so long." Sean Lynch, co-head of global equity strategy at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said earlier this week market volatility could pick up this month. "We believe that this volatility is likely to be focused on the riskier areas of the market, but that it may cross all equity classes," Lynch said in a Wednesday note to clients. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded more than 30 percent higher, near 16.4. "We wished for volatility and the VIX rose 30 percent," TD Ameritrade's Kinahan said. Fort Pitt Capital's Forrest also said the nuclear bomb test in North Korea held overnight may be weighing on market sentiment, since "North Korea has been a wildcard and continues to be a wildcard." Investors also kept an eye on oil prices Friday. U.S. crude settled 3.65 percent lower at $45.88 a barrel, a day after surging more than 4.5 percent following a 14.5 million barrel drawdown reported by the Energy Information Administration. Still, WTI posted a weekly gain of more than 3 percent, according to FactSet. Baker Hughes said U.S. oil rigs rose by 7. Wholesale trade data for July showed inventories remained unchanged, while sales fell 0.4 percent. U.S. Treasurys fell broadly on Friday, with the two-year note yield near 0.79 percent and the benchmark 10-year note yield around 1.67 percent. The U.S. dollar rose against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.1218 and the yen around 102.7. Overseas, European equities slid, with the Stoxx 600 falling 1.09 percent. In Asia, stocks closed mostly lower after North Korea held a nuclear test.
