Authorities said Joseph Bartorillo secretly injected semen into yogurt two female co-workers brought for lunch at the Procter & Gamble paper products facility in Wyoming County. Details continued to emerge Wednesday in the case that came to light Tuesday when federal prosecutors announced the 60-year-old was facing food tampering charges in the plot. Wyoming County District Attorney Jeff Mitchell vowed Mr. Bartorillo would face more charges on the state level. Mr. Bartorillo, a veteran employee, has no criminal history. "The victims began to notice something was wrong with their yogurts - there were pin marks," Mr. Mitchell explained, noting the yogurt also smelled and tasted bad. Authorities are still trying to determine a motive for the crime, which occurred at least 13 times between July 2010 and May of this year, the district attorney said. Mr. Mitchell stressed that no Procter & Gamble products were contaminated. Alex Fried, spokesman at Procter & Gamble's plant in Washington Twp., said Mr. Bartorillo is no longer an employee. Mr. Fried also wouldn't say how Mr. Bartorillo was caught. In a news release Tuesday, U.S. Attorney Peter Smith noted that all of the tainted containers were recovered and the public was not in danger. Court documents filed in the case indicate Mr. Bartorillo reached a plea deal with prosecutors that calls for a two-year federal prison sentence. A judge could reject Mr. Bartorillo's plea with federal officials and sentence him up to 10 years in federal prison, court documents say. Attempts to reach Mr. Bartorillo on Wednesday at his home in Larksville were unsuccessful.

Focus should be on advancing this group of workers’ skills to improve service delivery. PHOTO | FILE  By Queen Munguti Posted  Sunday, August 21   2016 at  17:38 In Summary Marketing strategy could see firm broaden consumer database for its products. Global product manufacturer, Procter and Gamble (P&G), has announced a partnership with the Midwives Association of Kenya (MAK) to address gaps in maternal healthcare services, a marketing strategy that could see the company broaden its consumer database for its products. SHARE THIS STORY Tweet “Midwives are often ignored in the majority of health systems, yet they play a critical role in the provision of quality and safe maternal healthcare,” said Anthony Nganga, P&G’s Commercial Director. “Partnering with Midwives Association of Kenya will place more emphasis on the childbearing cycle. We will focus on advancing their skills so as to improve service delivery to expectant mothers,” he said. The initiative comes as part of a long-term global programme: “We are proud to announce that P&G’s mother and baby healthcare programme has reached approximately 10 million mothers since its inception,” said Nganga. In line with this programme globally, P&G will now open a direct marketing channel to deliver product information and free product samples to new mothers, by partnering with MAK. “The partnership is a part of the P&G’s mother and baby healthcare programme, an educative programme where we visit different healthcare facilities around the country and talk to mothers who have just delivered and at the same time give free samples of our diaper brand, Pampers,” said George Owour the Government Relations Manager for P&G. “As we conduct the educative programme, we also collect the mothers’ contact information so that we can do follow ups .” Throughout this kind of database marketing, brands can create a long lasting relationship with consumers, which fosters brand loyalty. “Such a marketing strategy creates brand visibility and once a consumer has a free sample of product there is a high chance they will continue using the same product afterwards, leading to brand loyalty,” said Jael Amara, the director of Consumer Options. “And again, interacting with the consumers is an indication that the brand cares, thus creates a brand-consumer relationship that may be long term.” For P&G, the strategy could see increased sales in their products while at the same time provide a competitive advantage in the market place. According to an article on the impact of database marketing by Valient Market Research, a corporate strategy, market research and advisory firm, the effective use of database marketing can help a brand generate personal communication to its customers and differentiate its brand among competitors. “It presents distinct advantages for certain brands that are willing to use its data to improve its marketing efforts.” Another example of this is Road Runner Sports, a store that specialises in selling athletics gear in the US In 2006, it partnered with Experian Marketing Services, an information service company, in order to create and develop a database marketing solution to communicate with, integrate and understand their customers better, according to an article on the partnership by PRNewswire. “The key to growing our business is to create a compelling shopping experience with every customer interaction,” said Peter Taylor, general manager for Road Runner Sports. “To do this with the highest degree of effectiveness, we quickly realised that we needed a database marketing solution that would integrate our customer data across our entire enterprise to provide the foundation of analysing customer information.” 1 | 2 Next Page » Latest from Daily Nation: Business LeapFrog buys Goodlife Pharmacy for Sh2bn Family Bank staff cut costs push lender to issue profit warning State bets on new pest-proof storage bags to reduce maize wastage Fraudsters give Kenyans importing vehicles from Japan sleepless nights Airtel loses 16-year battle against KRA’s Sh531m claim NSE top gainers & losers n-soko About us Contact us Digital Editions Syndication Help Privacy Policy Terms RSS

One of the youngest U.S. Olympians this year in Rio, Hernandez has also been one of the most high-profile, winning the gold with the team in the all-around competition, and scoring an individual silver medal for the balance beam. Exuberant and talkative, Hernandez’s big smile and cheerful demeanor have earned her legions of tween fans – and given her the nickname “the human emoji.” She has even earned a partnership deal with Crest toothpaste – which makes complete sense once you see her smile. With the competition behind her, a carefree Hernandez sat down with PEOPLE at the P&> Family Home in Rio to talk about the games, her fans, and her future. GettyYou’ve had an amazing time here at the Olympics. What has been the best part of being part of the Final Five? It was great to really experience it with these other girls. We were all from different backgrounds, but we came together for a reason. I loved that about it. You have spoken before about your heritage, and how important it was for you to represent Hispanics. What did you mean by that? We’re a very diverse group this year with gymnastics, and I think that’s amazing. I think that it’s such a great thing for me to represent Hispanics. When I was a little kid, I don’t remember looking up and seeing so many Hispanic athletes out there. But look at this Olympics. There was Monica Puig, who I think is just awesome!” So what’s the message of the Final Five? The message is don’t stop at anything. Don’t let people tell you that you can’t do something. It doesn’t matter whether you’re black, white, Hispanic. If you want something, just go out and do it. I hope that little girls – black, white, Hispanic, whatever – can look at our team and find someone to inspire them. Do you think of yourself fas a role model? I don’t know. Gosh, I want to be a role model. I want to be able to know that I inspired girls to work hard and go for their dreams, and to never give up. I hope that is the message that people get when they see me. I hope the Final Five has shown that everyone is capable of success if they work hard. I wasn’t just representing Hispanics; I was representing Team U.S.A. I hope people understand that. What’s something that would surprise people gymnastics? I think people don’t know how much work goes into it sometimes. I wish people could watch the hard days that we all go through. I wish they could see the days when it’s just really rough, and that we have to push through it, and still come out with a smile. Then they’d understand. Getty You’re going on a nationwide tour where you’ll get to see a lot of fans up close. Looking forward to it? Absolutely! It’s a 36-city tour. I’m just so excited. We’ll go out there and enjoy ourselves while we’re out there. You’ll really see this happiness radiate through all of us! So how do you handle school while training and touring? I’ve actually been homeschooled since the third grade. I’ve learned how to fit my schooling in – weekends, evenings. I’m good with the time management. I’m keeping up with my studies. You’ve got a huge fanbase of tweens. Is that funny to you? I think it’s hilarious and great! I think it’s because I’m almost in the same age level as them, and I’m doing something that they dreamed of doing. As a little kid, I watched the gymnasts and said, “Wow, mom. I want to go to the Olympics.” So the fact that I’m actually here is mind-blowing to me.

Peltz Los Angeles Times Twitter Facebook Email Reddit When the Summer Olympics end Sunday, the clock starts ticking for medal winners hoping to cash in on their glory. Other than established multimillionaire stars such as U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps and Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, the Olympians have a brief window of opportunity – most likely a few weeks – to sign potentially lucrative endorsement deals once the Games are over. A handful might profit handsomely, notably gymnast Simone Biles, who arrived in Rio de Janeiro with endorsements already in hand and then captured the nation’s attention by winning four gold medals and one bronze. But most medalists won’t get rich from their efforts because corporations looking for celebrity endorsers know that the athletes – and their Olympic sports held only once every four years – don’t maintain the attention paid to traditional sports such as football and baseball, experts said. “Very few of them” will attain significant wealth from the Rio Games, said Ben Sturner, chief executive of Leverage Agency, a sports and entertainment marketing firm. “The news media will not be covering you three or four weeks from now.” That’s especially true with the Summer Olympics, said Matt Delzell, managing director at the Marketing Arm, a sports marketing agency. “The shelf life is so short for Summer Olympians because the timing is so bad,” he said. “We’re two weeks away from college football and the NFL, and the Major League Baseball playoffs are soon, so it’s a terrible time for the Olympic athletes to make hay in the spotlight. ”Most marketers know that Katie Ledecky’s name, come January, sadly is going to be a whole lot lesser known than it is now,“ even though the swimmer captured four gold medals in Brazil, Delzell said. It’s a moot point at the moment for Ledecky, who has opted to attend college and maintain her amateur status. But Biles – a three-time world champion – and others chose to turn professional, with Biles dropping plans to attend UCLA. Biles, 19, had inked endorsement deals before the Olympics began, including a television commercial for Procter & Gamble Co.’s Tide detergent that ran during the games, and her net worth already tops $2 million, according to MoneyNation.com. Biles and four other athletes also have been on the front and back covers of various Kellogg Co. cereal boxes since mid-June, extending the decades-old tradition of Olympic athletes being featured on cereal boxes. But for most Olympians, ”it’s just tough“ to land sponsorship deals, not only because they’re no longer on television but also because they’re less likely to maintain the buzz on social media that advertisers now crave, said Matt Balvanz, vice president for analytics at Navigate Research. ”What are the social-media conversations about these athletes and how soon do they fall off? Two weeks out, no one will be talking about them,“ Balvanz said. None of the medal winners in Rio returns home empty handed, however. The United States Olympic Committee pays bonuses – $25,000 for each gold medal, $15,000 for silver and $10,000 for bronze – that can be accepted by amateur students such as Ledecky under NCAA rules. Certain sports federations also pay bonuses to American medal winners. The USA Wrestling Foundation, for instance, is handing out a sizable $250,000 for gold medalists in Rio, along with $50,000 for silver and $25,000 for bronze. The Olympic gold medals themselves, which are 85 millimeters in diameter and weigh 500 grams, are valued at about $564 apiece, based on the recent price of gold, according to Forbes. That’s well below the record price of $708 for the 2012 Olympics in London, when gold and silver prices were higher. Each gold medal, produced by the Mint of Brazil, actually is mostly made of silver and plated with six grams of gold. If the entire medal was made of gold, it would be valued at nearly $22,000. That’s still small change compared with a multimillion-dollar shoe or apparel contract that a select few, such as Phelps, have been able to command. But this year, ”is anybody going to make seven-figure endorsements from these Olympics? I doubt it,“ Delzell said. Phelps reportedly has a net worth of $55 million, and Bolt’s reportedly tops $60 million, in good part because they’ve had long, superlative careers spanning more than one Olympics. That’s kept them relevant with consumers, analysts said. Yet even if other athletes don’t hit the endorsement jackpot immediately after these Olympics, they can still build a career from their momentary brilliance at the Games, said Rob Prazmark, chief executive of 21 Sports & Entertainment Market Group. Some Olympic athletes find ways to stay in the public’s eye – and thus relevant for endorsements from corporations – by appearing on TV shows, making public appearances or joining the broadcasting field. ”Dancing with the Stars,“ for instance, has become a destination for former Olympians such as soccer player Hope Solo, figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi and speed skater Apolo Anton Ohno. ”Don’t measure it by how much money they make this year,“ Prazmark said. “Their value as an Olympian doesn’t end after they win gold, it’s how they work their Olympic achievements. You don’t have to be Michael Phelps to make a career out of being an Olympian.” Published: Aug. 21, 2016, midnight  Tags: business, olympics Click here to comment on this story » ​ Follow the Spokesman wherever you are: Facebook Twitter Newsletter Subscribe Unlimited Digital Access Print edition home delivery Help Customer Service Sitemap Directory Subscriber Services Classifieds Classifieds Advertising Obituaries More Staff Cowles Jobs Archives/Research Buy photo reprints Jumble Crossword Horoscopes Contact Us Downtown Spokane 999 W Riverside Ave Spokane, Wa 99201 Mailing Address P.O.

Certain sports federations also pay bonuses to American medal winners. The USA Wrestling Foundation, for instance, is handing out a sizable $250,000 for gold medalists in Rio, along with $50,000 for silver and $25,000 for bronze. The Olympic gold medals themselves, which are 85 millimeters in diameter and weigh 500 grams, are valued about $564 apiece, based on the recent price of gold, according to Forbes. That’s well below the record price of $708 for the 2012 Olympics in London, when gold and silver prices were higher. Each gold medal, produced by the Mint of Brazil, actually is mostly made of silver and plated with 6 grams of gold. If the entire medal was made of gold, it would be valued at nearly $22,000. That’s still small change compared to a multimillion-dollar shoe or apparel contract that a select few, such as Phelps, have been able to command. But this year, "is anybody going to make seven-figure endorsements from these Olympics? I doubt it," Delzell said. Phelps reportedly has a net worth of $55 million, and Bolt’s reportedly tops $60 million, in good part because they’ve had long, superlative careers spanning more than one Olympics. That’s kept them relevant with consumers, analysts said. Pages: 1 2 > display on one page Tags: Business Inside NorthJersey.com Today's celebrity birthdays:... Tony winner shares insights...

Peltz Los Angeles Times (TNS) When the Summer Olympics end tonight, the clock starts ticking for medal winners hoping to cash in on their glory. Other than established multimillionaire stars such as U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps and Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, the Olympians have a brief window of opportunity – most likely a few weeks – to sign potentially lucrative endorsement deals once the Games are over. A handful might profit handsomely, notably gymnast Simone Biles, who arrived in Rio de Janeiro with endorsements already in hand and then captured the nation’s attention by winning four gold medals and one bronze. But most medalists won’t get rich from their efforts because corporations looking for celebrity endorsers know that the athletes – and their Olympic sports held only once every four years – don’t maintain the attention paid to traditional sports such as football and baseball, experts said. “Very few of them” will attain significant wealth from the Rio Games, said Ben Sturner, chief executive of Leverage Agency, a sports and entertainment marketing firm. “The news media will not be covering you three or four weeks from now.” That’s especially true with the Summer Olympics, said Matt Delzell, managing director at the Marketing Arm, a sports marketing agency. “The shelf life is so short for Summer Olympians because the timing is so bad,” he said. “We’re two weeks away from college football and the NFL, and the Major League Baseball playoffs are soon, so it’s a terrible time for the Olympic athletes to make hay in the spotlight. “Most marketers know that Katie Ledecky’s name, come January, sadly is going to be a whole lot lesser known than it is now,” even though the swimmer captured four gold medals in Brazil, Delzell said. It’s a moot point at the moment for Ledecky, who has opted to attend college and maintain her amateur status. But Biles – a three-time world champion – and others chose to turn professional, with Biles dropping plans to attend UCLA. Biles, 19, had inked endorsement deals before the Olympics began, including a television commercial for Procter & Gamble Co.’s Tide detergent that ran during the games, and her net worth already tops $2 million, according to MoneyNation.com. Biles and four other athletes also have been on the front and back covers of various Kellogg Co. cereal boxes since mid-June, extending the decades-old tradition of Olympic athletes being featured on cereal boxes. But for most Olympians, “it’s just tough” to land sponsorship deals, not only because they’re no longer on television but also because they’re less likely to maintain the buzz on social media that advertisers now crave, said Matt Balvanz, vice president for analytics at Navigate Research. “What are the social-media conversations about these athletes and how soon do they fall off? Two weeks out, no one will be talking about them,” Balvanz said. None of the medal winners in Rio returns home empty handed, however. The United States Olympic Committee pays bonuses – $25,000 for each gold medal, $15,000 for silver and $10,000 for bronze – that can be accepted by amateur students such as Ledecky under NCAA rules. Certain sports federations also pay bonuses to American medal winners. The USA Wrestling Foundation, for instance, is handing out a sizable $250,000 for gold medalists in Rio, along with $50,000 for silver and $25,000 for bronze. The Olympic gold medals themselves, which are 85 millimeters in diameter and weigh 500 grams, are valued at about $564 apiece, based on the recent price of gold, according to Forbes. That’s well below the record price of $708 for the 2012 Olympics in London, when gold and silver prices were higher. Each gold medal, produced by the Mint of Brazil, actually is mostly made of silver and plated with six grams of gold. If the entire medal was made of gold, it would be valued at nearly $22,000. That’s still small change compared with a multimillion-dollar shoe or apparel contract that a select few, such as Phelps, have been able to command. But this year, “is anybody going to make seven-figure endorsements from these Olympics? I doubt it,” Delzell said. Phelps reportedly has a net worth of $55 million, and Bolt’s reportedly tops $60 million, in good part because they’ve had long, superlative careers spanning more than one Olympics. That’s kept them relevant with consumers, analysts said. Yet even if other athletes don’t hit the endorsement jackpot immediately after these Olympics, they can still build a career from their momentary brilliance at the Games, said Rob Prazmark, chief executive of 21 Sports & Entertainment Market Group. Some Olympic athletes find ways to stay in the public’s eye – and thus relevant for endorsements from corporations – by appearing on TV shows, making public appearances or joining the broadcasting field. “Dancing with the Stars,” for instance, has become a destination for former Olympians such as soccer player Hope Solo, figure skater Kristi Yamaguchi and speed skater Apolo Anton Ohno. “Don’t measure it by how much money they make this year,” Prazmark said. “Their value as an Olympian doesn’t end after they win gold, it’s how they work their Olympic achievements.” Other stories of interest Farmer donates grass-fed 40-pounder to food bank BUSINESS DIGEST || Trump’s vow to bring back coal gives hope Wal-Mart will kick off Cyber Monday on Friday Don't Miss a Story Sign up for our newsletter to receive daily news directly in your inbox.

Getty By Cat Harvey-Jenner Aug 20, 2016 1. The athletes village is like a university campus, with a mini bank, post office, and supermarket for their convenience. 2. But it'd be a pretty exotic campus, because this one even has its own little beach for the athletes to feel like they're sunning themselves at Copacabana in the run-up to their competitions. 3. The competing countries' athletes are housed in tall tower blocks, with each nation decorating the outside of their digs with flags to properly mark their territory. Getty Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 4. And they really do get carried away with the patriotism. Record-breaking cyclist Laura Trott told Cosmopolitan UK that the British team's block is "so GB, there's lions and flags all over the place." That said, there's a real feeling of camaraderie between the Olympians, at least if this picture from Team USA's Jake Dalton proves anything: Athletes from all over ✌🏼️ #OlympicVillage #Rio2016 pic.twitter.com/0UOr0yrAHX— Jake Dalton (@jake_dalton) August 1, 2016 5. The athletes had their own little opening ceremony, where they all gathered at the center of the village and welcomed fellow competitors in country by country. The games organizers put on samba dancers and music for it, but this was apparently cut short because of noise complaints from some of the less fun-loving athletes trying to get their sleep. 6. Athletes can get their hair and nails done in a private salon in the village set up by Procter & Gamble (which owns the likes of Aussie, Pantene, Always, and Olay). Nothing like some patriotic nails for a bit of extra luck. Getty 7. Competitors staying at the village are given a food voucher for every meal, just like college meal plans. (Um, sorry, Olympians?) 8. Except there's only one food outlet in the village, and it's McDonalds. Yeah, you'd think it'd be something more like Whole Foods, right? 9. And although you wouldn't think it, McDonalds proved so popular among athletes, there were queues all the way across the concourse. Nothing gets in the way of an athlete who wants a Big Mac for lunch, it seems. And the answer is YES they do have a McDonald's in the Olympic village! Not that I ever eat at McDonald's at home but with ad much salt as they're putting in the food, I'll make an exception! Chicken salad it is for lunch. #olympicvillage #olympics #salad #tryingtoeathealthy #toomuchsalt #fitness #trackandfield #food #doingmybest #olympian #mealofchampions A photo posted by Jarrin Solomon (@jpump44) on Aug 9, 2016 at 10:53am PDT Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 10. Athletes don't have to stay in the Olympic village; it's totally up to their team and how much funding they've got. It's thought that none of the Team USA Olympic team actually stayed there, opting to rent space elsewhere. 11. It's like "being in the Big Brother house," according to Trott. "It's insane, every single person in there wants the same thing; there's like thousands and thousands of people in there and you're all striving for gold medals," she told Cosmopolitan UK. #views 🇧🇷 A photo posted by Gabby Douglas (@gabbycvdouglas) on Jul 27, 2016 at 11:40am PDT Pre-practice Maté sesh in this gorgeous Village 😋 A photo posted by Samuel Mikulak (@samuelmikulak) on Aug 1, 2016 at 7:13am PDT 12. The rooms are actually pretty underwhelming compared to the luxury you might imagine. Each one comes complete with a collapsible wardrobe, a full-length mirror, and a beanbag for all those times they need to chill in between events. Also, the apartments have been plagued by more than their fair share of catastrophes — I'm talking busted toilets, major leaks, and crappy Wi-Fi.) 13. The bedsheets are decorated with the little Rio symbols for all the different events. You know, just in case they wake up and forget where they are. 14. But the beds are far from comfy, with Trott even comparing them to camp beds. In fact, the British cycling team brought their own, because you need a good night's sleep before competing in the Olympics, right? 15. Most athletes have to share rooms, like some kind of hostel. Apparently there can be up to four people per room, so I dread to think what would happen if you got landed with one foghorn of a persistent snorer the night before your big competition. SHUT. UP. 16. But couples don't tend to share together. Famous British cycling couple Laura Trott and Jason Kenny stayed in completely separate apartments, she told Cosmopolitan UK. "We're in different apartments, but they're opposite each other, so I just keep going in there!" 17. The games organizers accounted for some sex going down nonetheless. And they want the athletes to stay safe, it seems, with a staggering 450,000 condoms being located in and around the village. That works out at 42 condoms per athlete. There's even a guy whose job is to walk around and pass out condoms. Well, if safe sex were an Olympic sport, this lot would be raking in the gold medals. 18. Despite the obvious rivalry, tensions don't tend to run too high. "You're all in your separate blocks," says Trott. "The GB team is completely in our own block, although a lot of the smaller nations share." Advertisement - Continue Reading Below 19. And everyone comes out to support each other. "There's a little picnic area out front where everybody goes to watch each other," Trott revealed, adding that there's even a hashtag used among athletes to show unity — #OneTeam. Cute. 20. Everyone travels around the village on bikes. Very eco-friendly! 21. Athletes are seriously careful about hygiene in the village. "It only takes one illness to get into your block to take you all down," Trott told Cosmopolitan UK. "My teammate even wore a mask! That's taking it to an extreme level, but everyone's obsessed with hand sanitizer, and they've even given us this scrub thing they use in hospitals," the gold medalist added. When your team mate takes not getting ill to a whole new level ... @ciarahorne1 😂#shethinksshesadoctor A photo posted by Laura Kenny (@laura_trott31) on Aug 3, 2016 at 4:46am PDT 22. The toilets in the apartments contain signs that remind athletes to shut the lid of the toilet before the flush it to stop germs getting out. Now that is being excessively cautious.

News’ Zuri Hall at the P&G Family Home in Rio. “I’m not sure if I’ll have time.” Still, the 19-year-old powerhouse athlete, standing at 4-foot-9 and weighing in at 104 pounds, is hoping to eventually compete on “DWTS” — once her schedule permits. “I would really love to do it in the spring if that’s possible,” Biles said, of her possibly joining season 24’s cast, should she miss her mark for the fall segment. Earlier this week, a source confirmed to E! News that producers were eyeing the teen athlete, who’s racked up four gold medals, including women’s vault and floor exercise, as well as bronze medal, in the Rio Olympics, as one of the 12 contestants that will compete during the upcoming season. Along with Biles, the dance competition show is rumored to have their sights set on “The Bachelorette’s” JoJo Fletcher and former star of “The Fosters” and “Wizards of Waverly Place” Jake T. Austin. Should Biles join the show for its 24th season in the spring, she’ll be following suit with her gold medalist teammate Aly Raisman, who competed on season 16. Meanwhile, Shawn Johnson won season eight (and came in second on the All-Stars season), and Nastia Liukin took part in season 20. For details on the official cast, mark your calendars, as ABC is set to announce their season 23 front-runners on “Good Morning America” on Tuesday, Aug. 30, with the season premiere airing on Monday, Sept. 12 at 8 p.m. In the meantime, what are your thoughts on the star gymnast joining the dance show?

It's no wonder the success of our athletes has been reported all across the world. Newspapers, social media and TV screens are all filled with well-deserved praise for the Olympians racking up medals faster than most of us could run the 200m. But they're not the only ones who deserve recognition for their hard work – without their mothers, the achievements of our homegrown sports men and women may never have been realised at all. “I don't think people appreciate that,” explains Glenda Trott, ambassador for P&G’s Thank You Mum campaign and mother of GB’s top female athlete, Laura Trott - the only British woman to have four gold medals. “We made a lot of sacrifices. Both our girls are cyclists so when they were growing up, Emma would go in one direction on the M25 with her dad and I'd go in the other direction with Laura. “That was our life, constantly driving around. We didn't have holidays. We would go to places where they had competitions instead, like Manchester and Newport. It was hard as parents. But it's something we've sacrificed and done for our girls. At the end of the day, that's what being a parent is about.” As incredible as it is to be an Olympian, it’s also selfish. Athletes like Mo Farah have spoken about the demanding nature of their career and the impact it can have on friends and family, who are often forced to put their lives on hold for the sake of their loved one. Laura Trott, 24, agrees with this and admits that, during the week of her phenomenal wins, her family was “side-lined” for her career. She’s not the only one. Helen Glover took part in the world’s first live VR press conference from British House at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games hosted by Samsung.  Helen Glover, the rower who just won a gold medal at Rio 2016, is 30-years-old but still regularly calls on her mother for help. “As an athlete you almost lean on your parents longer than normal people - financially sometimes, emotionally, practically,” she explains. “If I call my mum up and say 'what's my national insurance number', she can help. I definitely couldn't function without her.” Both Helen’s parents helped her financially when she made the decision to leave her teaching job in Bath to join Team GB in Reading several years ago. Even after she received lottery funding, they occasionally provided financial assistance. Monetary support from parents can be crucial for young Olympians. Glenda Trott explains that, when Laura started cycling, they were fortunate enough to be able to buy her bike and equipment – which added up to hundreds of pounds.  “Not everyone can do that,” she admits. “It’s a shame there aren’t many schemes in place to help. There might be more budding Olympians out there we don't even know about.” But it’s not just economic support their daughters require – it’s emotional, too. I do get moody before a race. I think everyone around me knows itHelen Glover “They need you the whole time,” stresses Glenda. “Even now Laura’s asking 'what happened in that race, tell me everything'. It's constant. You have to keep thinking. Even in the middle of her events, she was on the phone to me saying 'I can't do this'. “But that's what it about. We take the flack but we have to encourage them: 'No you can do that. Go back to bed, have a couple hours sleep, rethink and come back out'.” For Rachel, the best way to help her daughter Helen can be to stay silent. “We try not to say anything that would upset her,” she tells me. “I frequently say the wrong thing. It’s normally innocuous, like 'this is going well don’t you think?' But if it’s not the right timing, she’ll say, 'not really'.” Helen admits it’s true: “I tend to get very negative so when I speak to her, it’s to verbalise those fears. If I'm worried about wind or something and I share that, they'll know I'll be a bit stressed. Mum doesn't say that much, which is good because it's really easy to say the wrong thing. “She's so good. I can say something and know what I want her to say back - and she'll say it. If she didn't, I'd probably get like, ‘argh why can't you just say that?’ I do get moody before a race. I think everyone around me knows it. If I've gone a bit withdrawn or into myself, they know it's normal. They're very, very patient with me.” Steve Backshall and Helen Glover But the biggest way Helen has leaned on Rachel during the Rio Olympics is by asking her to organise her wedding to TV presenter Steve Backshall. The pair are set to marry in less than a month, and Helen says her mum has ‘pretty much done the wedding planning.’ “Steve and I were happy to wait a year for the summer after the Olympics to get married - but our parents were like, 'what?' So we said that if we were going to do it this year, we'd need help - and my mum was at the front of the queue. She wouldn't let us even look into a wedding planner.” Luckily she ‘trusts her mum’s taste’, but all she knows is that the wedding will be back in Cornwall where she grew up and will reflect hers and Steve’s personalities in that they’re "both quite relaxed, so it will be a nice informal thing.” Laura, too, tells me that her mum has been instrumental in planning her wedding to fellow gold medallist Jason Kenny, which also takes place in September. But wedding planning is nothing compared to what Jess Ennis-Hill asked her mum to do during this Olympics: stay at home to help take care of her two-year-old son, Reggie. “I’m happy to do it,” says her mum, Alison Powell, from Sheffield, where the whole family lives. “Reggie has watched all of the events with his dad. He knows that mum is running and jumping and shooting – he probably thinks all mums do that.” For Jess, it meant she didn’t have to worry about her son missing meals or not sleeping well in Rio, or in a worst case scenario, catching Zika. “I knew it was the right thing for me to come to Rio and him to stay at home with my mum and Andy, so he's in a secure environment and I can come here and concentrate on competing,” she explains.  Jessica Ennis-Hill and her mum, Alison Powell, support P&G's Thank You Mum campaihn “Mum is great and has been so helpful. This has been a completely different Olympics having her at home helping.

Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Visa and the rest of the corporate sponsors of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro won't be paying any taxes on the money they earn there due to a tax exemption law that's set to cost Brazil hundreds of millions of dollars. RELATED: Olympic Chefs Feeding Rio's Poor The exemption, which lasts until Dec. 31, 2017, excludes from taxes revenue generated by advertising, product sales, imports and any other activity related to the organization of the games. "It is yet another manifestation of the privileges that multinationals worldwide have today," said Antonio Martins, director of the alternative Brazilian news outlet Outras Palavras. "And it's not an isolated event, which is limited to a sports mega event," he told the BBC. Brazil has 37 million people living in extreme poverty, its economy is currently in recession and the interim government of Senate-imposed President Michel Temer has approved a fiscal austerity program. Meanwhile, the country is expected to lose about a billion dollars in tax revenue thanks to the exemption, according to BBC. RELATED: Booed at Olympics, Temer Still Thinks Govt Is 'Extraordinary' According to Naomi Fowler of the Tax Justice Network, the tax exemption on corporations is a precondition forced on any candidate to host a world sport event. “Every country must accept that they will become a tax haven for these companies during a period of time,” Fowler told the BBC. Among the main sponsor companies of Rio 2016 are Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Visa, Bridgestone, Samsung, Panasonic, Omega, Procter & Gamble, General Electric, Nissan, Globo, Nike, Microsoft and Airbnb. According to organizers, the Olympic Games are an opportunity for the host country to bring in tourists, invest in infrastructure and promote a healthy lifestyle among its citizens, but it’s also true that most countries are in debt after the games and have to undertake severe austerity measures.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ NEW YORK: India-born former Goldman Sachs director Rajat Gupta's latest bid to have his insider-trading conviction overturned should be rejected, prosecutors have told an appeals court here, asserting that he got a fair trial and the jury convicted him for his "criminal" conduct. In a lengthy brief filed before the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit this month, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said Gupta's conduct of repeatedly tipping his business partner Raj Rajaratnam with material non-public information in "ways that furthered Gupta and Rajaratnam's shared financial interests" remains "criminal" and he is "not actually innocent". Bharara said Gupta's appeals from an order denying his motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence should be rejected and he is not entitled to the relief he seeks. In May, Gupta, 66, had filed an exhaustive brief in the appeals court, arguing that the judgement of the Manhattan district court finding him guilty of insider trading "should be reversed" and his "conviction should be vacated". Gupta's appeal came on the back of a landmark ruling by the Manhattan appeals court that for an insider trading conviction prosecutors must show that a defendant received a personal benefit for passing illegal tips. Gupta's lawyers have cited the ruling that led to the reversal of insider convictions of hedge-fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson in December 2014. Asserting that there is no legal basis to overturn Gupta's verdict, Bharara said Gupta was convicted by a jury in a "fair trial" for "repeatedly and brazenly" disclosing material non-public information to Rajaratnam in violation of the fiduciary duties Gupta owed to Goldman Sachs and Procter and Gamble, companies on whose boards of directors he served. "This conduct, which was motivated by Gupta's substantial financial entanglements with Rajaratnam and his multi-billion dollar hedge fund, is as criminal today as it was before Newman," Bharara said. "Gupta received a fair trial before a properly instructed jury; that jury simply agreed with the government's evidence of guilt, rejected Gupta's proffered defences and convicted Gupta for the conduct he committed. There is no legal basis to disturb that verdict," he said. The top federal prosecutor in Manhattan noted that at no point did the District Court instruct the jury to convict Gupta based on a Newman-invalidated "mere friendship" theory of benefit. "Indeed, the 'friendship' does not appear in the jury instructions at all. The District Court instead instructed the jury that tipping in furtherance of Gupta's good and frequent business relationship with Rajaratnam would suffice under the law. Newman says nothing to the contrary," he said. Gupta is a free man now, having completing his two-year prison term on insider trading charges in March this year. Gupta was convicted in 2012 of passing confidential boardroom information to now jailed hedge fund founder Rajaratnam. He is currently subject to a term of supervised release.

In a lengthy brief filed before the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit this month, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said Gupta’s conduct of repeatedly tipping his business partner Raj Rajaratnam with material non-public information in “ways that furthered Gupta and Rajaratnam’s shared financial interests” remains “criminal” and he is “not actually innocent”. Bharara said Gupta’s appeals from an order denying his motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence should be rejected and he is not entitled to the relief he seeks. In May, Gupta, 66, had filed an exhaustive brief in the appeals court, arguing that the judgement of the Manhattan district court finding him guilty of insider trading “should be reversed” and his “conviction should be vacated”.

Gupta was convicted in 2012 of passing confidential boardroom information to now jailed hedge fund founder Rajaratnam. He is currently subject to a term of supervised release. Gupta’s lawyers are arguing that in the wake of the Newman ruling, the “looser standard” that Gupta would have shared confidential company information with Rajaratnam because of a “friendship or good relationship” is no longer valid. “The government tried this case and the district court instructed the jury on that prior basis. Rajat Gupta was convicted on that prior basis — and served the entirety of his prison sentence for conduct that is not criminal. Accordingly, the judgement of the district court should be reversed, and Gupta’s conviction should be vacated,” they have said.

By: PTI | New York | Published:August 21, 2016 10:26 am In May, Gupta filed an exhaustive brief in the appeals court, arguing that the judgement of the Manhattan district court finding him guilty of insider trading “should be reversed” and his “conviction should be vacated”. India-born former Goldman Sachs director Rajat Gupta’s latest bid to have his insider-trading conviction overturned should be rejected, prosecutors have told an appeals court, asserting that he got a fair trial and the jury convicted him for his “criminal” conduct. In a lengthy brief filed before the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit this month, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said Gupta’s conduct of repeatedly tipping his business partner Raj Rajaratnam with material non-public information in “ways that furthered Gupta and Rajaratnam’s shared financial interests” remains “criminal” and he is “not actually innocent”. Bharara said Gupta’s appeals from an order denying his motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence should be rejected and he is not entitled to the relief he seeks. In May, Gupta, 66, had filed an exhaustive brief in the appeals court, arguing that the judgement of the Manhattan district court finding him guilty of insider trading “should be reversed” and his “conviction should be vacated”. Gupta’s appeal came on the back of a landmark ruling by the Manhattan appeals court that for an insider trading conviction prosecutors must show that a defendant received a personal benefit for passing illegal tips. Gupta’s lawyers have cited the ruling that led to the reversal of insider convictions of hedge-fund managers Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson in December 2014.

There is no legal basis to disturb that verdict,” he said. The top federal prosecutor in Manhattan noted that at no point did the District Court instruct the jury to convict Gupta based on a Newman-invalidated “mere friendship” theory of benefit. “Indeed, the ‘friendship’ does not appear in the jury instructions at all. The District Court instead instructed the jury that tipping in furtherance of Gupta’s good and frequent business relationship with Rajaratnam would suffice under the law. Newman says nothing to the contrary,” he said. Gupta is a free man now, having completing his two-year prison term on insider trading charges in March this year. Gupta was convicted in 2012 of passing confidential boardroom information to now jailed hedge fund founder Rajaratnam. He is currently subject to a term of supervised release. Gupta’s lawyers are arguing that in the wake of the Newman ruling, the “looser standard” that Gupta would have shared confidential company information with Rajaratnam because of a “friendship or good relationship” is no longer valid. “The government tried this case and the district court instructed the jury on that prior basis. Rajat Gupta was convicted on that prior basis — and served the entirety of his prison sentence for conduct that is not criminal. Accordingly, the judgement of the district court should be reversed, and Gupta’s conviction should be vacated,” they have said.

Olympic champion addresses the rumours Creative gymnast secured four gold medals at the Rio 2016 Olympics. By Toyin Owoseje August 20, 2016 17:52 BST Simone Biles first revealed her crush on Zac Efron at the Ellen DeGeneres ShowGetty Olympic champion gymnast Simone Biles has addressed reports that she is set to compete in the upcoming season of Dancing With The Stars. The 19-year-old American athlete, who won four gold medals at the Rio 2016 Olympics, said that despite her desire to participate in the TV competition, her busy schedule would not allow it. US Weekly previously reported that ABC producers were eyeing up the talented teenager for season 23 of DWTS. "They would love to cast some Olympians if possible," a source told the magazine. However, the news should be taken with a pinch of salt as the network has not officially confirmed anything. "I would love to do Dancing with the Stars, but so far we have a three-month tour after this Olympics," she told E! News' Zuri Hall at the P&G Family Home in Rio. "I'm not sure if I'll have time." But hope is not completely lost. The artistic gymnast said that she should the opportunity present itself for the season 23 cycle she would not turn it down. "I would really love to do it in the spring if that's possible." Should her reality TV debut happen, Biles would follow in the footsteps of fellow Olympians Shawn Johnson, Nastia Liukin and Aly Raisman. Dancing With the Stars returns to screens on Monday, 12 September, at 8pm EST on ABC. The network has yet to announce this year's line-up. Meanwhile, Biles has continued her winning streak since emerging victorious at Rio. She struck gold once again when she spent some memorable moments with her celebrity crush Zac Efron. As they posed for photos the Baywatch star surprised her with a quick peck on her cheek. "Just call me Mrs Efron already @ZacEfron," an ecstatic Biles tweeted along with the photo of Efron kissing her. ðð¹ just call me mrs.efron already @ZacEfron pic.twitter.com/FF4NTgj4MP— Simone Biles (@Simone_Biles) August 16, 2016 More from IBTimes UK Brilliant Usain Bolt and Simone Biles help ease pain as Rio experience draws to a close What happened when Rio Olympics star Simone Biles met her crush Zac Efron?

Safe, clean water in the marshland | Sun.Star Skip to main content Archive Webcast E-paper Videos Multimedia Home Local News Business Opinion Sports Feature Lifestyle Entertainment SuperBalita Home / Davao / Weekend / Safe, clean water in the marshland Safe, clean water in the marshland Time to read 2 minutes Share Print a- a+ Read so far Safe, clean water in the marshland Saturday, August 20, 2016 CRISTELIE'S family seems content with their life in the marshland. They start the day at 4 in the morning. She and her husband, Jomer, would talk for a while over coffee before the former would head out to fish. At 6, she starts preparing her children, Jomarie and Kristin for school. "We live a very simple life," she shares. As soon as the clock hits 7, she starts paddling her canoe, a small boat with no built-in outriggers, to bring her children to school. She tags along 1-year old Daniel, her youngest. "Our lives revolve around the lake - our homes, our source of income and even our drinking water." Life in Agusan Marsh Cristelie's is one of the more than 40 Manobo tribal families in Sitio Panlabuhan, a floating village situated at the heart of Kanimbaylan Lake. Just a speck of the whole marshland, Agusan Marsh covers 15 percent of the country's freshwater resources. Home to more than 250 bird species, it is a wildlife sanctuary and was declared a protected area. Sitio Panlabuhan also boasts of its houses, including the two churches, primary school and community centre, that are built on piles of bamboos which adjust to the rise and fall of the water. Taking off from Bunawan, Agusandel Sur, it takes about 2 to 3 hours of boat ride to reach the village. While the place is in itself a paradise, the Manobos are confronted with the problem on safe drinking water. "We rely on rain for drinking water. If there is none, we go to a nearby spring that is also connected to the lake. If we are really left with no choice, especially during floods, we drink from the lake," village chairman Julie Bello shares. It's in the same source that they do their washing, bathing and other activities. Cristelie started worrying when her children started having stomach problems. As much as she and her husband want to bring them to the hospital, they can't because of how secluded their place is. Besides, going out of the swamp is expensive and no easy feat. Most of the families rely on herbal medicine. "We knew it was because of the water they drink but we didn't have any choice," she said. According to World Health Organization, contaminated water may cause water-borne diseases, the most deadly of which are diarrhoeal infections. It causes about 1.5 million child deaths each year, mostly among children below five. The clean water project In partnership with Procter and Gamble and in coordination with the local government, World Vision introduced PUR packets in Sitio Panlabuhan last October 2015. A water purification technology, PUR powder is able to remove bacteria that causes waterborne diseases. Each sachet can treat up to 20 liters of water. "It is also easy to use," shares World Vision staff Franklyn Salindato. The sachet is poured into unclean water and then stirred until the bacteria form into small particles that will settle at the bottom of the pail. The PUR-treated water will then be strained through a white cloth. "I was uneasy at first but seeing how a peat-coloured water turned crystal clear, it must have been the answer to my prayers. As a mother, it gives me peace of mind knowing that my children are drinking safe water," says Cristelie. Today, she also bathes her children, especially one-year-old Daniel with PUR-treated water. Her children's school was also provided with PUR packets. "This has helped reduce cases of diarrhea in our village. It also raised awareness amongst us regarding the importance of clean water," Bello said, adding that because most of the people in the village grew up drinking water from the lake, they feel that it's no problem at all. "There has been a lot of changes. The spring where we used to get water when we were little is no longer as clean as it used to be," he said. World Vision’s clean drinking water project, now on its second phase, has already benefited more than 9,000 families.

Seals Huge Advertising Deal With Omnicom Group Inc. The telco giant just dumped WPP and consolidated its creative, digital, and media ad accounts under Omnicom. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Aug 20, 2016 at 11:00AM AT&T (NYSE:T) recently centralized its creative, digital, and media accounts under a single account with advertising and PR giant Omnicom (NYSE:OMC). The decision represents a major victory for Omnicom and a big loss for its rival, WPP (NASDAQ:WPPGY). Omnicom's BBDO previously handled creative accounts for the AT&T brand, while WPP's Grey and MEC respectively handled the DirecTV and media accounts. But with advertising now becoming a more significant part of AT&T's business, the telco invited both companies to make a pitch for the integrated creative and media business. After two months of review, AT&T moved the DirecTV account to BBDO and the media account to Omnicom's new media agency, Hearts & Science. Let's take a look at how this deal could help both AT&T and Omnicom. Image source: AT&T. What the deal means for AT&T Lori Lee, senior VP and global marketing officer at AT&T, said in a prepared statement reported by FireceWireless that a "single integrated team allows us to move quickly, innovate at scale and take a data-driven, holistic approach to reaching consumers and businesses." Lee noted that those capabilities would be important as it launches "new streaming video entertainment choices that are built for mobile." Streamlining those operations would complement the integration of AT&T's wireless service and DirecTV. AT&T currently offers unlimited wireless plans for DirecTV customers, and "data free" websites and videos to counter similar services like T-Mobile's Binge On and Verizon's Go90. AT&T will also launch three streaming video services later this year -- DirecTV Now, an app for content from its satellite TV business; DirecTV Mobile, an app for premium video content; and DirecTV Preview, an ad-supported service with free videos from a wide variety of sources. AT&T will reportedly rely less on broadcast TV ads and more on digital ads, which isn't surprising since many cord-cutters are pivoting toward OTT [over-the-top] and mobile platforms. Centralizing ad operations for the wireless, mobile, pay TV, and media accounts under Omnicom would enable AT&T to gather analytics from a single system and make focused marketing pushes to strengthen its core wireless and pay TV businesses. What the deal means for Omnicom AT&T spends more on advertising than any other telco in the U.S., and its total U.S. ad spending is only topped by consumer staples giant Procter & Gamble. Ad Age reports that AT&T spent $3.3 billion on ads in 2014, which represented nearly 3% of its operating expenses. Ad Age hasn't released AT&T's estimated ad spend for 2015 yet, but it's likely much higher following the acquisition of DirecTV last July. Omnicom won't handle all of AT&T's advertising business -- multicultural creative will be handled by multiple agencies, and Cricket's creative work will still be handled by Argonaut. However, Cricket's media buying, which was previously handled by MEC, will be moved to Hearts & Science. But Omnicom will oversee enough of the business that we can safely assume that it will handle a few billion dollars of AT&T's ad buys within the next year. This victory could get Omnicom's revenue growth -- which missed estimates over the past three quarters -- back on track. Sales rose just 1.8% annually to $3.88 billion last quarter, missing estimates by $30 million. Advertising revenue, which accounted for 53% of its top line, rose 7.7% annually and outperformed its smaller CRM, PR, and specialty businesses. Prior to the AT&T announcement, analysts expected Omnicom's revenue and earnings to respectively rise just 2% and 8% for the full year. Those estimates could now be too conservative as AT&T ramps up its ad spend in the second half of the year. It could also convince other major customers with fragmented ad accounts to centralize those operations with Omnicom -- which would be bad news for rivals like WPP. The key takeaways AT&T's decision to consolidate its ad accounts with Omnicom is a win-win deal for both companies. AT&T streamlines its ad campaigns for new DirecTV branded initiatives, and Omnicom's revenue and reputation get a nice boost. The clear loser here is WPP, but the massive group -- which serves ads for all 30 Dow companies, 77 of the NASDAQ 100, and 352 for the Fortune Global 500 -- should shrug off that loss fairly easily.

By Katy O'Donnell 08/20/16 07:42 AM EDT The 12th and final annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative will showcase both its philanthropic work and Hillary Clinton’s greatest potential vulnerability. | Getty Facebook Twitter Google + Email Comment Print Hundreds of corporate executives, foreign dignitaries and celebrities will pile into a Manhattan ballroom to hobnob with Bill and Chelsea Clinton next month at their charity’s keynote annual event — just days before Hillary Clinton defends herself against pay-to-play accusations from Donald Trump in their first debate. The 12th and final annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative will showcase its philanthropic work and also the Democratic nominee’s greatest potential vulnerability — her ties to a sprawling global charity that has accepted donations from Middle Eastern governments, foreign businessmen with checkered histories and major corporations with business before the government. Story Continued Below Some Democratic operatives say they’re dismayed by the timing of the three-day conference Sept. 19-21 — a week before the first national debate and seven weeks before Election Day. They say it’s inevitable that having two members of the former and perhaps future first family rubbing shoulders with the well-heeled and well-connected will provide fresh ammunition to the Republican campaign, even as Hillary Clinton is off honing rebuttals to charges that donors got special consideration from the government while she was Secretary of State. "Some might suggest that the Clinton Global Initiative is simply a glitzy week of highlighting troubling donors," said Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf. "Others will see it as an annual event highlighting distinctive international issues. In the debate, Trump will see it as ammunition to batter the Democrat." "The timing is obviously not good," said one Clinton veteran, adding that it was probably unavoidable. “These events get planned months and months and months in advance and canceling it on short notice is not possible." Clinton Foundation to stop accepting foreign and corporate donations if Hillary wins By Nolan D. McCaskill Trump is likely to intensify his critiques of the foundation after the resignation Friday of his former campaign chair, Paul Manafort, whose murky financial ties to Russia and pro-Russian Ukrainian officials undercut the force of Trump’s argument on the Clintons’ relationships with foreign donors and governments. While GOP nominee Mitt Romney addressed the conference four years ago, this year, Republicans are using charges of cronyism and favorable access for Clinton Foundation donors as a key line of attack against the Democratic nominee. Bill Clinton’s announcement Thursday that he and his daughter, Chelsea, would stop raising money for the foundation and turn over operations to independent parties if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency will likely be overshadowed by media attention on this year’s confab. The foundation has not disclosed this year’s sponsors, and it’s unclear whether the announcement Thursday will serve as a last call — bringing in a flood of cash before the spigot is turned off, or underscore how fraught donations might appear in the middle of a presidential campaign, and give potential contributors a reason to pass. As of Friday, three heads of state — Argentinian President Mauricio Macri, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic — were listed as speakers. The price of admission is steep: For a $20,000 annual membership fee, corporations and nonprofits can secure an invitation for their top executive to mingle with the likes of Angelina Jolie, Bill Gates and Queen Rania of Jordan, while brainstorming projects to address problems ranging from poverty and climate change to elephant poaching. Boston Globe calls for freeze on Clinton Foundation donations By Tyler Pager The CGI event, which is timed to coincide with the United Nations General Assembly, has traditionally been a more glamorous version of the proceedings a few blocks away, drawing Nobel laureates, Hollywood celebrities, leading CEOs and heads of state. The meetings have “convened more than 190 sitting and former heads of state” since they started in 2005, according to the foundation’s website. "To wind down something that is that substantive and that impactful is not easily done,” said Clinton campaign and foundation donor Jay Jacobs. “… Whatever hits, unfair as they may be, may come the way of President Clinton or the candidate Hillary, or the foundation, there are some things that just transcend politics." The conference has also been linked to less glittery names; it was at the 2009 meeting that the “Clinton Global Citizen” award for “excellence in public service” went to Rwandan President Paul Kagame, whose economic success in the country has been matched by human rights abuses and accusations of violence against his opponents. The political spotlight on this year’s meeting may be off-putting to some of the meeting’s usual sponsors. Barclays will not sponsor the event again this year, according to people familiar with the bank’s plans. Several other past sponsors have not finalized their commitments and at least one is leaning against participating this year. A handful of the 33 listed sponsors of last year’s conference confirmed to POLITICO that they are signing on again as sponsors, including Procter & Gamble, Microsoft, the Ford Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. State Department: Clinton Foundation didn't influence us By Josh Gerstein Current and former sponsors include corporations in heavily regulated industries that stand to benefit from favorable government relations, from banking to pharmaceuticals to energy. Twenty-nine of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average index companies have been linked to the Clintons’ sprawling charities, Bloomberg reported in 2014. Twenty-five contributed to the foundation, and 27 committed to charitable projects through the Clinton Global Initiative, according to the report. UnitedHealth Group Inc. was the single holdout. Even a year ago, the swirl of negative headlines — detailing the overlap between contributors to the charity and the Clinton presidential campaign, lapses in donor disclosure and cases where foundation donors received favorable government actions — was already putting off wary donors and invitees, five months after Clinton had announced her candidacy. She stayed away from last year’s proceedings as she is doing this year. Several high-profile invitees, from Mark Zuckerberg to Pope Francis, declined to attend, POLITICO reported at the time. Obama and prominent members of his administration who’d spoken in the past also steered clear of the event. Meanwhile, Dow, ExxonMobil, PwC, Samsung, and foreign banks HSBC and Deutsche Bank declined to renew their sponsorships. Still, a few new corporations joined last year, including Gap Inc. and the Middle Eastern construction giant Consolidated Contractors Company. Annie Karni contributed to this report.

Which CPG brands are winning on Amazon? 18 Jul 16 | Author Graham Charlton | Ecommerce Stats Tweet The best sellers on Amazon aren’t always the brands you would expect. While the market-leading brands are becoming more effective on the site, it’s often new and emerging brands that sell on Amazon that are now benefiting from early-mover advantage. Amazon is so big that it cannot now be ignored as a marketplace for brands. Its sales are growing one to two times faster than ecommerce overall, while it drove 60% of total US online sales growth in 2015, capturing $100 billion in U.S. ecommerce sales. Stats from Profitero show the 100 best-selling products at Amazon in several key categories for the first six months of 2016, with a focus on CPG (consumer packaged goods). This is interesting, with Amazon’s recent focus on areas like online grocery shopping. Amazon Fresh is well established in the US, and has made moves in the UK recently. According to Alex McCord of Compass Marketing: “We’re now seeing the advent of ecommerce native companies: companies that come onto Amazon and other e-retailers and who are able to gain traction through getting a ton of recent reviews. They know how to work the Amazon algorithm and then launch products that, from the perspective of a brand in the brick-and-mortar world, have as low as zero market share. But in the world of unbranded search on Amazon and other retailers, they’re enormous players.” Profitero found that in Grocery and Beauty, the best-selling brand on Amazon is often not the brand that dominates that category offline. For example, healthy snack brand KIND tops the grocery best seller ranking at Amazon, while in Beauty, Pure Body Naturals is the winning brand with an average of 5,465 customer reviews. ArtNaturals takes the #3 spot with 5,512 reviews. The importance of unbranded search on Amazon Search at Amazon is the dominant pathway to product selection. According to a survey conducted by BloomReach last year, more shoppers go to Amazon before Google when they know what they’re looking for, and either want to find it or research it. New and emerging brands  are winning with Amazon because: Shoppers are searching for specific attributes (e.g. natural, gluten-free), and can find these products more easily on Amazon. Emerging brands are more aggressively optimizing their product content as they know this can gve them an advantage in Amazon searches. These brands are also often not widely distributed in brick-and-mortar stores, so shoppers have been trained to look for them at Amazon. The importance of consumer reviews Some of the most successful products have loads of reviews, and positive overall scores. For example, San Francisco Bay Coffee was the second best-selling grocery brand at Amazon between Jan-May 2016 with a staggering 23,696 reviews on average. This is further evidence of the importance of ‘social proof’. Melissa Menchaca of InstaNatural (a beauty brand that launched exclusively on Amazon in 2013) explains why reviews matter: “Because we’re so Amazon driven, social proof for us relates to reviews. More specifically product reviews from our customers. The reason why that is so important is because that is how we drive as a business. We’re very lean, we’re nimble, we’re fast-acting and this is what really sets us apart from other big name brands out there in the world. We’re able to gauge consumer interest about products and get that product to market faster than our P&G competitors.” In the battle of the beauty brands, who’s winning on Amazon? The study looked at the individual products that make up the top 100 best sellers for the Beauty category at Amazon. The analysis reveals that traditional beauty brands are well positioned. Procter & Gamble (P&G) was the leading beauty manufacturer at Amazon with seven best-selling brands appearing in the top 100 best sellers list (Oral B, Gillette, Crest, Braun, Gillette Venus, Oral-B Power and Olay), while Johnson & Johnson accounted for only four brands (Aveeno, Rogaine, Neutrogena and Nizoral). P&G products receive, on average, more than double the number of reviews that Johnson and Johnson products receive  (2,240 vs 1,132) further evidence that reviews do matter. With half of all predicted growth in CPG sales between now and 2018 expected to come from ecommerce, and with Amazon driving the majority of that growth, an Amazon strategy is essential for CPG brands.

The bottom line is that any advance in health IT or medical devices must be considered with one thing in mind, said Todd Dunn, director of innovation at Intermountain Healthcare in Salt Lake City, UT: The innovation is going to be used by healthcare providers on patients. “That’s the foundation,” he said. “You must start with empathy for the customer.” Dunn spoke this week leading one of the first sessions for the new class of startups at the Texas Medical Center’s TMCx accelerator, a group of 11 medical device companies from across the country. Over the course of three months, the startups will participate in seminars on topics including legal, financial, and IP issues; fundraising and financial planning; the hospital procurement process and sales and distribution. The program culminates in a demo day in November. Sure, Dunn told the group, technologists are infused with the belief that they are going to change the world. But he advised that the entrepreneurs should not to let that feeling bleed into arrogance. Instead, he stressed that they must constantly be curious, ask questions, and spend a lot of time being with the people who would be using the device. This approach is already common in some industries, from the movies to furniture to consumer goods like shampoo and laundry detergent. Pixar’s “Ratatouille” movie was successful, he said, because producers “did their homework,” watching chefs work in French kitchens—down to the angles of their elbows as they cooked—and wandering into a Paris sewer to see how the rats actually moved. Procter & Gamble [[(NYSE: PG)]] developed embedded-type systems in which employees lived in homes and worked with shopkeepers to better understand which products people want to use and sell. “If they’re doing this for soap, furniture, and toys, why isn’t it common for healthcare?” he asked. Dunn said being at the TMC can provide that same living lab for medical device startups. As they go about their visits to doctors, nurses, and other healthcare personnel, they should focus on discovering both points of frustration and hope, Dunn told the group. “What are the aspirational desires of doctors and look for workarounds,” Dunn said. “That’s where they are innovating.” Young medical device entrepreneurs need to figure out how their proposed innovations can perform customer jobs. “Nobody is a segment; they have jobs to do,” he said. These jobs can be broken down into functional, emotional, and social jobs, concepts for which he credits Harvard Business School professor and author Clayton Christensen. For example, a blood pressure monitor has a functional job: giving a reading. “The emotional job is making sure Mom and Dad are OK,” Dunn said. “The social job is ‘I’m being a good kid by using this for my parents.’ ” Angela Shah is the editor of Xconomy Texas.
