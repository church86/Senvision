Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Sep 9, 2016 at 3:48PM With dozens of billion-dollar consumer brands between them, Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) engage in their most fierce rivalry on the baby care aisle. The Pampers brand, which is P&G's biggest franchise, fights year after year against Kimberly-Clark's Huggies for the global market share lead. Procter & Gamble is on the winning side of that battle lately, yet the company as a whole is growing at a much slower pace than its key competitor. But which stock would make a better buy for investors right now? Let's take a closer look. Comparison metrics Metric P&G Kimberly-Clark Market cap $232 billion $45 billion Sales growth 1% 5% Profit margin 16% 11% Dividend yield 3% 2.9% Forward P/E 21 19 Sales growth excludes acquisitions and divestments and is on a constant currency basis for the past complete fiscal year. Data sources: Company financial filings and S&P Global Market Intelligence. Operating trends  Kimberly-Clark has its larger rival beat in the key operating metric of organic growth. Since it strips out the effects of foreign currency swings and brand divestments, this one figure best captures overall demand. The matchup isn't even close. P&G's organic growth fell for the second straight year to just 1%. Kimberly-Clark's expansion pace is down, too, but has been a much healthier 5% lately. Look beyond that headline number and the picture tilts even further in Kimberly-Clark's direction: Sales volume has been steadily positive for the company even as Procter & Gamble's volumes have declined. P&G managed a slight turnaround on this front last quarter, but has yet to produce the string of volume gains that would suggest a broad growth rebound. On the other hand, P&G is proving more adept at wringing efficiency gains out of its business. Costs are down sharply over the last two years, and management has identified billions of additional cuts that it aims to employ through fiscal 2018. PG Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts. As a result, it enjoys consistently higher profitability. That gap is likely to increase in the coming years, given that P&G has sold off many of its slower growing, less profitable brands. Cash returns Direct cash returns make up a large part of a shareholder's total return with stocks like these, since companies that produce consumer staples tend to generate predictable profit streams in good times and bad. Here, the matchup is a bit mixed. Kimberly-Clark has shown a stronger penchant for dividend hikes, while P&G prefers to focus on stock buybacks. P&G's recent dividend news has been disappointing for income investors. The payout improved by just 1% last year and by 3% the year before, which in each case was the lowest raise in well over a decade. P&G's annual dividend raise since 2003. Data source: P&G financial filings. Buoyed by its faster growth pace, Kimberly-Clark delivered 5% dividend raises in each of the last two fiscal years. On the other hand, P&G is spending a mountain of cash on buying back its own stock. The company is on pace to send $70 billion back to shareholders -- mostly through buybacks -- over the next few years. That represents an incredible 30% of its current market capitalization, and is only possible because the company is selling off big chunks of itself, including through divesting its Duracell battery business and its Coty beauty line. Kimberly-Clark's clearer path However, cost cuts and brand divestments can't offset sluggish growth forever. Thus, a P&G investment only makes sense if you believe the company will engineer a pivot back to market-beating growth after over two years of underperforming. The payoff would be significant in this case, as sales growth and profit gains would likely leap past rivals. A successful Kimberly-Clark investment, in contrast, requires less guesswork. It offers the same healthy mix of sales growth and above-average dividends that shareholders have enjoyed for years. In my view, that reliability makes Kimberly-Clark the more attractive bet right now, given how cloudy the operating picture is at P&G.

vator vatorX vatornews Register Log in Newsroom Innovation series Interviews Lessons learned Trends & news Will Procter & Gamble buy The Honest Company? Commerce M&A is on the rise, is the eco-friendly consumer company next? Financial trends and news by Steven Loeb September 9, 2016 | Comments Short URL: http://vator.tv/n/471f "'Why not? Why can't that be us? Why can't we build a foundation to become that [P&G] over the course of the next 100 years?'" said Brian Lee, co-Founder and CEO of The Honest Company, on stage with Bambi Francisco at Vator Splash La in 2014. Lee was responding to a question about Lee's vocal aspirations to become the next P&G. Well -- why not? Startups need to think big, after all. But a lot has changed since then - namely a rocky economy that's started a lot of M&A, and big ones in the commerce industry. There was Unilever buying Dollar Shave Club for $1 billion, and Walmart buying Jet for $3 billion. Now The Honest Company, the subscription service for eco-friendly baby and family products, could be the next commerce to be snapped up. The Santa Monica company, which was founded by former ShoeDazzle CEO Lee, along with actress Jessica Alba, is currently in talks to sell to what is described as "a big consumer product company," most likely either Procter & Gamble or Unilever, according to report from ReCode on Friday.  It's not a surprise. As Lee talked about at Vator Splash LA in 2014, P&G could use a little bit of The Honest Company's fresher and theoretically more eco-friendly brand.  "We are trying to build a foundation for a modern day family brand. You look at these large CPG companies that exist, they all start at some point. I mean P&G, it was either Mr. Procter or Mr. Gamble that was selling ivory soap out of the back of his truck, and they grew from there. And, so, we kind of look at these large companies out there and say, 'Why not? Why can't that be us?" said Lee.  If this deal goes go through, whoever winds up buying Honest will be putting down a good chunk of change. The company has raised $222 million in funding, most recently a $100 million round in August of last year, which valued it at $1.7 billion. Founded in 2011, the company designs and manufactures all of its own products, such as diapers, wipes and bath/skin care. The Honest Company also formulates and manufactures household cleaning products, such as laundry detergent, surface cleaners and dish soap. In late 2015, Honest launched its own line of beauty products as well.  The company sells "bundles" of items at set costs, including the Diapers & Wipes Bundle; The Essentials Bundle, which allows users to pick five cleaning items to ship every month; and The Health & Wellness Bundle, in which users pay for two vitamin/supplement items. In addition to selling directly to customer, The Honest Company makes money by selling products wholesale to various retail partners, such as Target, WholeFoods, Nordstroms, and Costco, among others. ReCode reports that the company saw revenue of around $300 million in 2015, up from $170 million in 2014, and $60 million in 2013. Even as revenue is rising, not everything has been going well, though, as Honest has been facing accusations and lawsuits over some of its products.  In 2015, the company saw hit with multiple lawsuits from consumers claiming that its sunscreen was "ineffective." Honest was also accused, earlier this year, of selling detergent with a chemical it had said it would avoid.  Alba dismissed these allegations in an interview with the Today Show earlier this month.  “If an organization wants to bring awareness to their cause, I’m an easy target and our brand is an easy target obviously, because I get a different kind of attention than other brands would,” she said. “We stand by our ingredients, the effectiveness of the products and we’re pretty optimistic that we’re going to win every case.” On the more positive side of things, The Honest Company has also been a frequent target of IPO speculation, with reports earlier this year that it was working with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to prepare to go public. By this summer, however, those plans had been put on hold.  During his Splash LA interview, Lee also spoke about his thoughts on a potential IPO for Honest , stating that he had no intentions to ever sell the company.  "We never started this company with the intent of selling it. We started this company really with the idea that we could make a difference in this world and really create safer and healthier environments for everybody," he said. "I think that, to achieve that, you have to reach a certain scale. You're not changing the world, you're not saying that many people, if you're doing $20 million in revenue. Even $100, $200, $500 million. You get there by being dramatically large and I think the only way we can achieve that by is taking the company public." Spokespeople for Unilever and The Honest Company would not comment on the report. VatorNews reached out Procter & Gamble for comment on any ongoing talks. We will update this story if we learn more.

P&G forecasts the strong dollar will hurt full-year earnings. Fred Katayama reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript The strong dollar slammed profit at P&G, the world's largest household products company, The maker of Tide detergent and CoverGirl makeup, which sells goods in 180 countries, said profit slid 31 percent in the latest quarter. Earnings would've risen if it weren't for currency translations. Procter & Gamble cut costs, but that wasn't enough to overcome the mighty dollar. Net sales shrank across its lineup from beauty and hair products to health care and baby care. P&G has been trying to boost profit by drastically shrinking the number of products it makes. It recently sold its Duracell battery business and Camay and Zest soap brands. But its margin shrank again. Look for foreign exchange to continue to pummel earnings. P&G called the outlook for this year "challenging," predicting that the currency impact will cut profit by 12 percent. It said it would try to offset that by further cutting costs. P&G has lots of company. DuPont, United Technologies and Pfizer also blamed the dollar for their weak full-year forecasts. P&G's shares, which have outperformed rivals Kimberly Clark and Unilever over the past 12 months, fell in early trading.

[PHOTO: ELVIS OGINA/STANDARD] While most Africans are battling the dark spots and other skin complications, Westerners are tackling the issue of skin wrinkles. The need for Africans to fix their skins has created a cosmetic market that has attracted multinationals. With a population growth expected to hit 2.5 billion by 2050, according to the UN Habitant Report of 2015, Africa is indeed a gold mine for the cosmetic business. Some of the international players are L’Oreal, Procter & Gamble and Unilever, who have developed expansion strategies to capture the beauty and personal care market in the African continent. Spending on cosmetics per capita on the continent is 10 to 20 times lower than in developed markets, according to market strategy consultants Roland Berger, and marketers are increasingly eager to tap into this potential for future growth. In Kenya, the beauty industry has created jobs for many as women spend fortunes on skin care products. One such individual is Peris Mbuthia, a mother-of-two and founder of Timeless Medical Spa based in Nairobi. “I was on holiday in Mombasa when I developed a rash which really affected my face and I needed it fixed but I could not find a trained beauty aesthetician,” says Ms Mbuthia. From this, she saw a business opportunity and flew to Canada to strategise on her new business venture. She then enrolled for a diploma in medical aesthetics, which focuses on improving cosmetic appearance through the treatment of skin conditions.

She later got space at the Lavington Mall where she spent Sh3 million on an interior designer who did not meet her expectations. Being one not to easily give up, she tried another designer who also disappointed. “This was more than just business gone wrong. I needed to make an impact and do something for my community and for my country. It was all about me not giving up on my dreams,” Ms Mbuthia says. After many false starts, she set up Timeless Medical Spa in June last year. The spa focuses on the growing middle class, seeking beauty and wellness. It offers services like skin relaxing, renewal and revival of one’s beautiful skin to perfection, using safe, effective and non-invasive cutting edge technology.

Slate Sign In Sign Up Jessica Alba’s Startup Might Be for Sale Jessica Alba’s Startup Might Be for Sale Slate Sign In Sign Up Slate Moneybox A blog about business and economics. Sept. 9 2016 4:08 PM Jessica Alba’s Startup Might Be for Sale By Zoe Henry   Jessica Alba arrives on the red carpet in Hainan, China, on Oct. 23, 2014. Aitor Alcalde/AFP/Getty Images This post originally appeared on Inc. The Honest Co., the startup co-founded by actress Jessica Alba in 2011, is in talks to become acquired by another firm, according to Recode. That firm could be a larger consumer products company, such as Procter & Gamble or Unilever, sources said. Advertisement The fast-growing consumer goods company is estimated to bring in some $250 million in revenue this year through sales of its nontoxic, personal care products, including diapers, sunscreen, and baby formula. It was previously said to be considering an IPO this spring, though later scrapped those plans for fear of an unreceptive public market, according to Recode. The Honest Co. had set itself apart from the competition by promising not to use health-compromising chemicals in its products. Still, the startup has come under fire as of late, with several lawsuits claiming that some of the products contain chemicals it promised not to use, such as sodium lauryl sulfate. The Honest Co. has called these suits "baseless." Get Slate in your inbox. So far, the 5-year-old company has raised $222 million, and is valued at an impressive $1.7 billion. It wouldn't be the first consumer products firm to sell to a larger company, as traditional retailers recognize the growing importance of e-commerce. Earlier this summer, Dollar Shave Club, the subscription-based retailer of men's grooming products, was sold to Unilever for $1 billion. A majority of the Honest Co.'s sales come through its own websites, which would be attractive to a potential acquirer. And similar to Dollar Shave Club, its customers can subscribe for monthly deliveries of bundled products, which makes up some 80 percent of its e-commerce sales, according to co-founder and CEO Brian Lee. "The bundles work really well for us, and subscriptions represent a pretty large portion of our revenues," Lee told Inc.'s Lindsay Blakely in an on-stage interview last year. "It's extremely helpful for predictability and forecasting of inventory."

Jessica Alba’s Honest Company, a venture-backed start-up that sells eco-friendly diapers and other premium personal-care products, may be be looking for a buyer. Recode reports that Alba’s company, which has raised $222 million in funding and was recently valued at $1.7 billion, has been in talks to sell itself to a consumer packaged-goods company like Unilever or Procter & Gamble. If the company sells for anything near its current valuation, it could mean a massive payday for Alba, who reportedly owns between 15 and 20 percent of the company—a stake worth as much as $340 million. The health-conscious motivation behind Alba’s decision to start the Honest Company turned out to be remarkably prescient. As is now tech-industry lore, Alba was terrified when she broke out in hives after washing her unborn baby’s onesie with laundry detergent. “I was thinking, what if my baby has a reaction and I don’t know? What if her throat is closing?” she told Vanity Fair in a recent profile. In 2011, she decided to get serious about finding products she could safely use on her own kids, launching the Honest Company with C.E.O. Brian Lee, President Sean Kane, and Chief Product Officer Christopher Gavigan. And fellow health-conscious consumers responded. What began as a small company selling just 17 items took in $300 million in revenue in 2015, according to Recode. The Honest Company has not escaped criticism or controversy. Last year, its S.P.F.-30 sunblock came under fire after consumers claimed it wasn’t actually effective at blocking the sun, leading to a $5 million class-action lawsuit. The company’s liquid laundry detergent has also faced scrutiny for allegedly containing sodium lauryl sulfate, a chemical compound the Honest Company had said it would “never consider for use in anything. Period.” (The Honest Company has responded that sodium coco sulfate, which it uses, is not the same as sodium lauryl sulfate, and has said that its sunscreen was found to be safe and effective after testing by a third party.) Alba’s company, which was reportedly preparing for an initial public offering, chose not to move forward its plans earlier this year, according to Recode. But the timing may be improving for a sale. Larger, more established consumer-product companies seem to be gravitating toward acquiring start-ups with successful online operations. In July, Unilever purchased the direct-to-consumer razor company Dollar Shave Club in a $1 billion, all-cash deal. (Like Dollar Shave Club, the Honest Company makes the bulk of its online sales through monthly subscription fees.) A month later, Jet, a year-old Amazon competitor, was said to be in talks to be acquired by Walmart to the tune of $3.3 billion.

Now I want to be him for real. That’s why I’m entering Procter & Gamble’s casting call for the next Mr. Clean. I’m bald. I wear an earring. I’ve been told that I look good in a tight white T-shirt. And I do bear a strong resemblance to the chrome-dome muscleman of grime-removal. Besides, as a Huffington Post reporter, I’m no stranger to dirt. Sure, I’m just a few mop-up jobs short of age 55, but shouldn’t Mr. Clean be a little washed-up? All you other wannabe Mr. and Ms. Cleans are welcomed to apply online as well. You’ll need to fill out an application and submit a video with the jingle. Or you can show up at an audition in Los Angeles Sept. 14. The winner gets $20,000 and a trip to New York City to appear in the 2017 limited edition Mr. Clean Calendar. But be warned: I’m going to wipe the floor with you. Since all entries must include a part of the Mr. Clean jingle, fellow HuffPost writer David Moye helped me get a head start by recording his own version with a ukulele: Actor Kellan Lutz already took his shot at a video to promote the contest.

Alba co-founded The Honest Company, which places a heavy emphasis on selling non-toxic household products. She launched the company in 2011 with Brian Lee, an entrepreneur who co-founded Legalzoom.com and ShoeDazzle.com. According to a Recode report, Alba is now in talks to sell the company, and the likely buyer could be a large consumer product company, such as Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE: PG) or Unilever plc (ADR) (NYSE: UL). Recode added that Alba's company was recently valued at $1.7 billion last year when it raised $100 million. Related Link: FDA Orders Stores To Cleanse Their Shelves Of Ineffective Hand Soaps Alba may have also picked an opportunistic time in discussing a potential sale. Consumer-packaged goods companies are now "grappling with the increasing importance of e-commerce to their future" but have also "become intrigued by startups" that boast large followings. Forty (40) percent of Honest Company's business comes from selling through the traditional retail landscape and the remainder comes from online sales. Finally, Honest Company was preparing itself for an initial public offering in February of this year but those plans were put on hold. Sources familiar with the situation told Recode that the company did not feel that the public market was going to be receptive to its offering at the time.

The class of 2015 on the advanced management programme at Barcelona’s IESE Business School went further than most by setting themselves up as a business angel network. The decision to form PDG Invest, named after the Spanish initials for the IESE management course, is all the more remarkable because none of the 40 members had any significant experience as angel investors. Ramón Faus Ramón Faus, who came to study at IESE after working for several years as a senior corporate lawyer, exudes excitement about being part of a link to Barcelona’s fast growing start-up community. “When I was a lawyer in the Spanish division of Procter & Gamble I was an employee,” he says. “When you are launching a project like this, you feel it is yours.” A fundamental question was whether another angel network was needed in a city like Barcelona, whose success as an entrepreneurial hotspot is, in large part, thanks to a plentiful supply of rich individuals looking to back local early stage ventures. Faus argues that the city does and stresses that PDG Invest distinguishes itself from its peers in that its members have years of experience from the senior executive level. “Our way to compete is the know-how of the 40,” he says. PDG Invest has a €1m investment fund to put into new ventures in Barcelona, created by each of its members committing to put in €8,000 per annum over 10 years. This makes the investment for each individual affordable, according to Faus. The goal is to invest in 10 early stage start-ups with the potential, not yet realised, of achieving a period of rapid growth that could provide substantial returns for the investors’ original stake. Not all 40 PDG Invest members have to commit their money to every investment. Only 13 agreed to back PDG Invest’s first two companies, a cosmetics business called Cocunat and a smartphone app for classified advertisements called 500 Markets, both of which received €100,000. The risk of encouraging management students with little or no experience of investing to become business angels is reduced by the shared experience of individual PDG Invest members, according to Faus. The size of the group means that there is usually at least one person who understands the sector an investment opportunity operates in, he notes. “We have no hurry,” he says, adding that PDG Invest received 50 funding proposals in its first three months of operation, thanks partly to entrepreneurs attending IESE’s start-up events. “There are many projects, but not many good ones and you have to choose well,” Faus notes. “We know that out of 10 investments, five or six will go wrong. For us it is going to be a great learning experience.” Another PDG Invest member is Agustín Andujar, who before coming to study at IESE was a manager at Dow Chemical Spain. “In my opinion we are going a little bit fast,” he says about the speed with which former classmates have signed up to the first two investments. “But hopefully in a good way.” Trust in his fellow students’ judgment is critical, according to Andujar. Although PDG Invest has a process for assessing funding bids, the final call tends to come down to each member’s instinct, Andujar admits. “It is the stomach,” he says. “What is the impression we are getting of these companies from our stomach.” Whether the group can make any money from its chosen investments is uncertain. But according to Andujar this is not critical. The biggest selling point for him, apart from remaining in regular contact with his former classmates, is the feeling that he is helping hard-working people develop their businesses. Barcelona has gained a reputation as an entrepreneur-friendly city in recent years, helped by the high quality of life, low cost of living and positive global image the city has fostered in recent decades. “We are helping with this entrepreneurial society,” Andujar says. “We are the good guys.” Luisa García-Valdecasas This is echoed by Luisa García-Valdecasas, another PDG Invest member, who also works in the fundraising team at IESE. She stresses that it is critical to support job creation among young people in a country where their employment prospects are limited. “It is very important to have these people adding value to the economy,” she says. A short walk from the IESE campus, at Barcelona’s other business school, Esade, there is another, more established, angel investor programme for former students. Esade Business Angel Network (Ban), which recently won the award for Europe’s best private network of business angels, comprises more than 200 private investors. Out of the 600 projects it analyses a year, it has invested a total of more than €15m in 94 companies over the past four years. Channelling more than €4m into 43 entrepreneurial projects last year. The team hopes to invest a similar amount in 2016. The catalyst for forming Esade Ban in 2008 was the school’s 17,000-strong alumni organisation of former students, according to Fernando Zallo, Esade Ban’s director. The biggest selling point is the feeling of helping hard-working people develop their businesses One of the main goals of Esade Ban is to add discipline to those looking to become angel investors. “We want to professionalise the network,” he says. Esade Ban operates alongside other initiatives created by the school to boost new businesses, Zallo notes, including EGarage and EWorks, incubator programmes designed respectively to advance start-ups. “We as a business school thought it would be good to give a service to local entrepreneurs, but on the other side alumni were keen to invest,” he says. Business schools are good breeding grounds for angel networks because they can pool a critical mass of people with the brains and resources to invest, reducing the risks for any one individual taking part, according to Zallo. “We have created a school for business angels,” he says. “We try to teach students that this is a very risky investment class so you need to invest with others.”  Sample the FT’s top stories for a week You select the topic, we deliver the news.

Now it is specifying “social media” as its main source of news, with that niche overtaking television for the first time. The information comes from a study done by The Oxford University Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. It looked at consumers of news and information around the world for its “Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2016.” This is the fifth year it has issued such a report. It’s a fascinating report. Twenty-eight percent of 18-24 year-olds say social media is their main source of news, compared to 24 percent who cite television. Since 2013, the number of people in the US who say they get their news from social media has doubled – 46 percent now use social media for news. A lot of news sites are ramping up their development of video, betting on it as a growth strategy. Ad revenue is better on video. But the study finds the news audience isn’t so keen on seeing video. More than three-quarters still rely on text. Many find video inconvenient, with 35 percent citing pre-roll advertisements as an annoyance. News tends to be consumed at work—and the person in the cubicle next to you isn’t always thrilled to hear the full-blast volume of a Geico ad. When it comes to social media, Facebook rules the roost for sharing news. 44 percent of the survey respondents say they use Facebook for news, compared to just 10 percent from Twitter. 19 percent use YouTube for news. Snapchat, which is new to the news game, only registered one percent. We love to share news. A quarter of us share news via social media at least once a week. An interesting note: people in the US generally share stories they approve of, but people in the UK are more likely to share stories about things they don’t like. Read into national character what you will. What do social media news users want most? Breaking news. And this year, for the first time, the study tracked users of smart watches. They, too, want breaking news most on their device. The study is comprehensive and well worth a read. The audience keeps shifting, and the only thing that’s predictable is that it gets more social and more fragmented in a digital world in motion! Brands pitch in on Louisiana flood relief Following historic floods in Louisiana, numerous brands pitching-in on relief efforts. Target, Walmart, Starbucks and Tide all contributed in the wake of the epic rainfall that flooded the area with more than 6.9 trillion gallons of water in August. Target, which has six stores and over 1,000 staffers in the Baton Rouge area and other affected areas, has pitched in with volunteers and distribution of water and gift cards to local nonprofits. The retailer has also donated $100,000 each to the Salvation Army and American Red Cross. Similarly, Walmart announced that its foundation will give $1 million to various nonprofits including the Greater Baton Rouge Food Bank in support. In total, the retail chain is committing $1.5 million for food and supplies. “We have been working closely with nonprofit partners, first responders, elected officials and governmental organizations to learn how we can use our strengths to help,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation, in a statement. In late August, Tide, which is owned by Procter & Gamble, sent its Loads of Hope truck to Baton Rouge in order to collect, wash and dry laundry free of charge for victims affected by the floods. P&G also handed out cleaning products including Mr. Clean and Swiffer. Duracell also sent its truck with batteries and a charging station. Starbucks donated $100,000 to the American Red Cross, and the brand encouraged customers and employees to text “LAFLOODS” to 90999 in order to donate $10 to the relief fund. Some brands have taken their efforts in an untraditional direction. Pizza Hut started a GoFundMe page asking for contributions to help staffers affected by the tragedy. In addition, the Ad Council and GSD&M recently unveiled a black-and-white ad, “Our Turn,” in response to the disaster, which is the country’s worst since 2012’s Hurricane Katrina. The film, which includes a voiceover from Matthew McConaughey, directs viewers to OurTurntoHelp.org. Candy brands honor Gene Wilder, Willy Wonka News of actor Gene Wilder’s death took the internet by storm, and opened a flood of candy-inspired, tributes to the “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” from colleagues, fans and – Inevitably – candy brands. During his long career, Wilder was known for many films including the Oscar-nominated “Young Frankenstein” and “Blazing Saddles.” But sweet-toothed brands have been chiming in on Twitter to thank the star for his contributions to, you guessed it, the world of chocolate for his turn as Willy Wonka. The 90-year-old chocolatier Godiva Chocolates shared a tribute with its 17,200 followers: “Thank you Gene Wilder for making chocolate truly magical, the original Willy Wonka.” Also, the Twitter account for U.K. candy brand New Berry Fruits chose “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” as its film of the day. Smaller brands like candy retailer McMillers Sweets have also chimed in. It RIP’d the actor as the “original Candyman.” While the tweets have attracted only positive remarks – and reminiscent smiles – so far, brands that choose to grieve celebrities publicly enter murky territory. There are big risks when it comes to summoning personal tragedy – particularly when your tribute mentions your product in the same breath. Case in point: Crocs deleted its tribute to the late David Bowie (a shoe overlaid with the singer’s iconic lightning bolt) after Twitter users criticized it as opportunistic. Equally, Cheerios irked Prince fans with an RIP tweet that dotted the “I” with a single Cheerio. Other messages for Wilder were more personal. DeBrand Fine Chocolates simply wrote that the actor was a childhood inspiration. While Dandelion Chocolate, a bean-to-bar factory in San Francisco, added that it showed Wilder’s 1971 classic every year. Sweet memories, indeed, for one of our world’s greatest actors. Melted Mic | Samsung’s Galactic Image Goes Up In Flames! Samsung’s brand has melted into a tech nightmare! The South Korean electronics giant was forced to suspend sales of its new flagship smartphone, the Galaxy Note 7, last Friday because dozens of the handsets have exploded. The phone, which has been extremely well reviewed, is now also being recalled worldwide, in a move that is likely to cost Samsung millions. And compounding matters, the colossal disaster came on the eve of the launch of a new iPhone from Samsung’s archrival Apple – which launched new versions of its iPhone and watch on Wednesday. It’s a hard to overstate this Galactic brand blunder! When Samsung launched the Note 7, it had the stage to itself. It had the momentum. It had a very real shot at being the phone of 2016. But it’s reputation exploded instead. And replacing 2.5 million devices will cost Samsung hundreds of millions of dollars, and could certainly melt its sterling reputation for quality, at least for the foreseeable future. Each week, The Spin Cycle will bestow a Golden Mic Award to the person, group or company in the court of public opinion that best exemplifies the tenets of solid PR, marketing and advertising – and those who don’t.

At the board meeting of The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) held today, Srinivasan K. Swamy, chairman and managing director, R K SWAMY BBDO, was unanimously elected chairman of the board of ASCI. He has over forty years of advertising experience to his credit, and has also been a member of the board of governors of ASCI for close to ten years. Abanti Sankaranarayanan, vice chairperson, Confederation of Indian Alcohol Beverage Companies (CIABC), was elected vice-chairman, while Shashidhar Sinha, CEO, Media Brands was re-appointed the honorary treasurer. Other members of the board of governors include Al Rajwani (managing director and chief executive, Procter & Gamble Hygiene and Healthcare), Benoy Roychowdhury (executive director, HT Media), Dev Bajpai (executive director legal and corporate affairs and company secretary, Hindustan Unilever), D Shivakumar (chairman and CEO, PepsiCo India Holdings), Gurmit Singh (vice president and MD, Yahoo India), N.S. Rajan (global partner and MD, Ketchum Sampark ), Narendra Ambwani (director, Agro Tech Foods), Prashant Singh (MD, Neilsen India Region), Raj Jain (CEO, Bennett Coleman & Co.), Rohit Gupta (president - network sales and international business, Sony Pictures Networks India), S.K. Palekar (adjunct professor and advisor - executive education, Institute of Management Technology), Subhash Kamath (managing partner, BBH Comms India) and Sunil Lulla (chairman and managing director, Grey Worldwide India). Commenting on the development, Benoy Roychowdhury, the outgoing chairman of ASCI says, "It has been quite an exhilarating year for ASCI. We entered into the second year of collaboration with the Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA), and processed more than 1000 complaints against misleading advertisements received through their portal: Grievances Against Misleading Advertisements (GAMA - gama.gov.in). Encouraged by the success of the mobile app, we launched a WhatsApp Number +91 77100 12345 for consumers to send in complaints conveniently. ASCI continues to grow from strength to strength, and as the Chairman for 2015-16, I am very happy to have been an enabler for this journey." The incoming Chairman, Srinivasan K. Swamy, states, "It is indeed an honour to be elected as Chairman of ASCI which has progressively contributed to effective self-regulation in advertising content. We are confident that the marketing and advertising sectors, industry bodies, regulators, consumer activists and the general public will actively seek ASCI's services and make self-regulation more relevant in the increasing competitive environment. ASCI will continue to engage with stakeholders such as Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), Ministry of AYUSH, Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways (MORTH) to propagate self-regulation, in addition to DoCA. It is heartening to note that the Parliamentary Standing Committee has recognized the role played by ASCI and has recommended that it be given some legal teeth. I am therefore quite excited to take over the mantle as ASCI Chairman at this time when so many important things are on the anvil to further strengthen the principles of self-regulation. I hope to make 2016-17, yet another landmark year." During the year 2015-16, the Consumer Complaints Council (CCC) constituted by ASCI as an independent body (which has majority of its members drawn from civil society members including consumer activists, lawyers, doctors and educationists) met 49 times and deliberated on complaints against a total of 1389 advertisements. Of these, complaints against 891 advertisements were upheld, while 497 were not upheld, and a complaint against one advertisement was considered to be 'Non-issue'. As is the normal practice, all advertisers who do not follow recommendations to modify or withdraw the offending advertisement, will be referred to the concerned regulator for further action if they consider necessary. The Advertising Standards Council of India is a self-regulatory organisation for the advertising industry. Established in 1985, ASCI's role has been acclaimed by various government agencies. It is recognised under 'The Cable Television Network Rules, 1994' which states that 'No advertisement which violates the code for self-regulation in advertising, as adopted by the Advertising Standard Council of India (ASCI), Mumbai, for public exhibition in India, from time to time, shall be carried in the cable service'. ASCI is the executive arm of the Department of Consumer Affairs handling all complaints pertaining to misleading advertisements. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India has also partnered with it to address misleading advertisements in the food and beverages sector. The Role and Functioning of the ASCI and its Consumer Complaints Council (CCC) is in dealing with complaints received from consumers and Industry, against advertisements which are considered as false, misleading, indecent, illegal, leading to unsafe practices, or unfair to competition, and consequently in contravention of the ASCI Code for Self-Regulation in Advertising. 19SHARES Follow afaqs!

In fact, the city is quickly becoming one of the greenest, most innovative cities in the country. No longer known for just chili, baseball and the second largest Octoberfest in the world (outside of Munich), Cincinnati is evolving into a hub for technology, sustainability and social innovation. Startup Cincy Many people think of the U.S. tech industry as a bi-coastal phenomenon, but between Silicon Valley and New York City lies 3,000 miles of countryside dotted with booming business hubs. In fact, within the next five years, the Midwest will have more startups than Silicon Valley.  One of the fastest growing centers for tech innovation is Cincinnati. The city has seen the biggest startup growth in the nation as one of five metros jumping drastically in rank over the past year, according to the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurship. Home to the headquarters of 10 Fortune 500 companies, including Macy’s and Procter & Gamble, the metropolitan area also supports a growing community of tech startups through accelerator programs, low business taxes and connecting entrepreneurs with established companies and funding. “There’s a community of entrepreneurship [here] that you wouldn’t necessarily expect in a flyover city,” Mike Bott,  the co-founder of popular Cincinnati-based startup accelerator, The Brandery – told Entrepreneur. Recognized as one of the top accelerator programs in the U.S., The Brandery pushes startups through a four-month program, providing each with $20,000 in seed money and mentorship. And they’re not alone. Millions of dollars are invested in Cincinnati based startups each year through a variety of incubators, accelerators and innovative funding strategies. It’s not that Cincinnati has more money than other Midwestern cities, it’s just that those with the money are more deeply connected to the ecosystem of people and young companies with innovative ideas. Sustainable Cincy Cincinnati has about 60 sustainability initiatives outlined in the Green Cincinnati Plan which covers everything from renewable energy, to transportation, to food waste. The City’s ambitious sustainability efforts are focused on opportunities to meet multiple objectives at the same time. “In addition to benefiting the environment, our initiatives must make economic sense (save money, create jobs) and improve quality of life for residents (improve public health, mobility, connectedness)” explained Ollie Kroner, the Sustainability Coordinator for the City of Cincinnati. As a newly appointed, passionate Millennial, Kroner brings a fresh, visionary perspective to the position. “Our office takes on some of the world’s biggest, most challenging problems and we develop strategies that aim to improve quality of life for Cincinnatians as global citizens. It’s an opportunity to think big and be innovative. Honestly, it’s a big, difficult dream job” Kroner told TriplePundit. And the city has already come a long way. It was one of the first major cities to move to 100 percent green energy for its residents and businesses through the city’s Green Electricity Aggregation program. Not only did this reduce city emissions by approximately 247,000 tons of carbon dioxide each year, but also saves nearly $7 million dollars for the city annually. “There are several big picture issues we are looking at right now” said Kroner. “How can we accelerate the adoption of energy efficiency upgrades and solar energy? How can we divert our organic waste stream from the landfill? How can we prepare our city for electric vehicles? How can we embrace Smart City technologies to improve our environment, economy, and quality of life?” The City of Cincinnati has several exciting projects on the horizon. “We are currently working to roll out curbside textile and housewares recycling for residents. Anything you would have taken to Goodwill will be accepted for curbside pickup. We estimate these items to constitute 11 percent of our current waste stream, so this is an opportunity to put a big dent in our landfilled waste.” Solarize Cincinnati has installed solar panels on 20 homes in just the past two months and that pace is expected to accelerate. The Metropolitan Sewer District of Greater Cincinnati is pursuing anaerobic digestion to turn sewage sludge into an asset. This technology would replace incineration with a process similar to composting. Rather than burning the “waste,” sewage sludge can be a source of renewable energy and a fertilizer product. These are just a few of the many ideas the city is cooking up. Innovative Cincy When it comes to the intersection of sustainability and innovation, Cincinnati is certainly thinking outside the box. The city is exploring issues like how sustainability can be used to combat poverty, crime prevention through environmental design and how we can leverage the power of big data to drive change. Last year the City of Cincinnati completed building a LEED Platinum Net-Zero district police headquarters. The new solar and geothermal powered building consumes less than 50 percent of the energy used by traditionally designed facilities of the same size, making it a strong contender for the greenest building in Ohio. The Net-Zero Police Headquarters has green features that double as security features – like high-performance windows that insulate, but are also bulletproof; daylighting that reduces the need for artificial light, but also provides high visibility around the site and storm water collection that allows the rain to infiltrate into the soil, but also provides a physical barrier that would prevent a vehicle from crashing into the building. The city is currently evaluating the building’s performance to see if it can serve as a model for future city buildings. One day in the not so distant future, cities all over the globe will be tapping into big data to assess and drive change amongst their constituents. They will be able to access clear and concise data from every department that they oversee. For the City of Cincinnati, the dream is already a reality. “The City’s leadership has prioritized the use of data to drive good government decision-making.” explained Kroner. “We are currently working to build a dashboard of sustainability indicators to help us track the impact and progress of our sustainability initiatives. For example, by using smart sensors on our recycling bins, Cincinnati now has the largest publicly-owned body of recycling behavior data in the country. We use this data to target our outreach efforts to improve recycling participation rates.” “Many aspects of sustainability require behavioral changes – drive less, eat healthier, drop empty cans in the recycling instead of the trash” said Kroner. “Generally speaking, people don’t like change. Old habits die hard. Designing a program that provides multiple benefits and minimizes harms is hurdle number one. Communicating the benefits of a proposed change can be even harder.” However challenging the journey may be, it’s clear that Cincinnati is on the right track. It’s definitely one of the cities to watch in the coming years.

Statistics from Fortune Magazine says that 9 out of 10 Start-ups fail and the U.S. Census Bureau reports that 400,000 new businesses are started every year in the USA, however, 470,000 struggle to stay afloat at the same rate. Though the numbers are scary, it gives insight to the fierceness of the modern market place. The good news is that innovative businesses are surging ahead in spite of tougher competition, segmented markets and evolving consumer preferences. Multinationals like Cadbury, Coca-Cola, Nestle, Procter & Gamble and a few other companies have gained prominence in Africa over the years – thanks to their dynamism, innovation, experience and people. Surprisingly, new market entrants such as: Google, Facebook, Uber and the Telecoms multinational TECNO in a short time of business operations, have been able to consolidate market presence in their various markets. Speaking of market leadership, the rise of the TECNO brand from the low segment of the mobile market to a highly competitive high-end smartphone leader has been nothing short of a marketing brilliance. The Rise of Africa’s leading mobile brand; a case study on tech innovation success Back track to 2006 when TECNO entered the African markets with its revolutionary dual SIM technology. Nonetheless, the mobile maker struggled with negative consumer sentiments in its interest markets, particularly Nigeria where mobile users considered TECNO products to be substandard. Fast-forward to 2016 and TECNO brand has completely evolved—a leader in smartphone; the brand rolls out smartphone products year on year with good product reviews. In the Nigerian mobile space, an estimated 6 out of 10 persons use a TECNO mobile product, if the figure is anything to go by then, this means that TECNO smartphones are now the consumers’ preferred mobile. The brand’s different product lines namely: TECNO Boom, CAMON and the Phantom series have become very popular with mobile consumers, tech analysts and enthusiasts. Presently, TECNO smartphone products can stand head-to-head with top smartphone competitions in Africa. Interestingly, reports on mobile phone sales volume released by a Nigerian based research agency for November 2014 to May 2015 put TECNO on top in most African markets. The report also revealed that TECNO sold more mobile phones in Nigeria and Tanzania than any other OEM company in the period of the review. TECNO comes in second position in the Ghana, Cameroon and Ethiopia markets. In the Kenyan market, it maintains the third position behind Nokia and Samsung. The main markets of TECNO Mobile Overall, the research revealed that TECNO controlled 25.1% market share in six markets. While the report didn’t account for sales performance in other markets, it hinted TECNO popularity in African markets and places the brand’s smartphone products amongst markets sort-after in Africa, Middle East and Southern Asia regions. A community-centred business module, TECNO CSRs touch host communities Corporate Social Responsibilities, a success template that several leading global companies have adopted proves to be a good business case for brand marketing and TECNO has imbued the CSR culture in its business module across markets. Through life-touching projects, they are empowering people and communities. Worthy of mention of such project is the Light Up Ikeja initiative; a CSR project executed in the first quarter of 2016. Eighty plus (80+) solar-powered streetlights were installed in Ikeja’s electronic market (Popularly called Computer village) and environs to help with the security challenges faced in the area. Other Corporate Social Responsibility projects executed by TECNO include: scholarships for pupils in public primary schools in Nigeria (Lagos), support of the Michael Essien Foundation in Ghana, amongst others. TECNO light up Ikeja project TECNO’s ‘Give Children A Future’ scholarship program Clearly, dogged, innovative and visionary brands have a way of weathering the storm while consolidating market share. TECNO on its part has proven to be the smartphone constantly evolving to give consumers more value. The international launch of TECNO’s next flagship, the TECNO Phantom Series in Dubai this September could open a new global chapter for a mobile brand that has proven the African markets to be the best training ground for globally competitive multinationals.

Prisoners were used to clean the beaches after the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf, the largest marine oil spill in history. Exposed to deadly toxins, they were given no protective gear, evidence that prisoners used as slave labor are expendable. I am not shocked, I am not appalled, but every time this fact clicks in my brain that people don’t know, it truly takes me into an OMG moment. This is one of the biggest wow factors that I have ever experienced. Just think about it. Scenario: I am looking you square dead in your eyes and I am telling you that SLAVERY STILL EXISTS. OK, it may take some time for you to register this information because what you see around you are shopping malls, schools, restaurants, libraries, game rooms, beaches, hotels, grocery stores, highways, camping sites, resorts, schools, movie theaters, night clubs, gas stations, amusement parks – you see a functioning society full of all of life’s joys and people who are moving about freely. Some are going left, some are going right, and some are going north, some are going south, some are walking, some are driving, some are traveling by plane, bus and train, and some are even sitting still. You see them and they exist all around you. A large number of them are New Afrikan (Black people), and they don’t have to go to the back of the bus or even use separate bathrooms; they are enjoying life’s pleasures right along with everyone else. You see them in motion and you don’t see anyone in chains, shackles, or torn and tattered clothing. This is not what you see. The idea that slavery exists doesn’t fit in the equation of what you see around you. After processing my statement and your present reality, you turn to me and ask me, “What the hell are you talking about? I’m free. I am not a slave.” I proceed to tell you that what you understand is an illusion and it can change in the blink of an eye. Just one incorrect move can alter your “Amerikkkan dream.” Now I have your full attention because you enjoy driving your vehicle that you work so hard to make the monthly payments on. You enjoy your two-bedroom apartment full of nice furniture that you worked overtime to get so that you can impress and entertain your family and friends, inviting them over for snacks, card games and on holidays like every family should be able to do. This young prisoner in a forced labor camp in Georgia in 1932 is being punished. Prisoners worked as slaves can be tortured or killed without any monetary loss, so they are more expendable than slaves, who comprised a slave owner’s wealth. – Photo: John Spivak You enjoy that and, most importantly, you worked your ass off for it. To think that it could be gone in a blink of an eye and to think that you could be a slave is laughable: Ha ha ha. It’s unheard of, right? NO. I hate to be the bearer of bad news – i.e., the party pooper – but I have to be. My freedom depends on your understanding this undeniable fact. “We aren’t free until we all are free” is a saying not utilized by capitalists – in this case, slave owners. It is a saying used by freedom seekers and those who seek not to exploit the labor of others, those who wish to live in a just society. All must understand that YES, SLAVERY STILL EXISTS. So now you are all ears. Good. The United Snakes Constitution is a legal document which lays out the system of fundamental principles according to which the U.S. is governed. I would like to bring your attention to the 13th Amendment of 1865, the law that abolished slavery, or so we are taught. Unfortunately, many overlook the clause that tries to make continued slavery acceptable to the daughters and sons of our ancestors who were enslaved and those who fought like hell not to be. The 13th Amendment states in full, “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” Now this is pretty much in layman’s terms; it’s simply saying that if you have been convicted of a crime and you are captured you can and most likely will be subjected to slavery regardless if you like it or not. Why? Because it is the law. Get it? Got it? Good. So now you say: “That’s wrong. That’s insane. That’s horrible. Why would they do that? Why would they have that there in the Constitution?” The answer is this: Slavery was the best thing to ever happen to the United Snakes of Amerikkka. Slavery was and is today its bread and butter. To understand the U.S. and how it functions, you must understand capitalism. Capitalism at its core is a system built off and maintained on profit – profit and wealth for the individual and not the masses. In order for capitalism to exist, the people, we the people must remain powerless, while a few individuals, stakeholders, corporations control the wealth of nations. Only the overseer’s uniform and the modern photography tell us that this is 1975, not 1775. The prisoners are picking cotton on the Cummins Prison Farm in Texas, where many current prisons are former plantations. Texas and Georgia are the only states that pay prisoners nothing at all for their labor. – Photo courtesy The Marshall Project The mode of production is fueled by human labor. This mode of production became rampant and well defined with the rise of slavery, particularly with the enslavement of African people. As production and goods began to serve the interests of the few and wealth was being made, MORE, MORE and MORE became the desire of those who were benefiting from slavery. They then contemplated on ways to become masters of the economy, and with the growth of industrialization and the supposed abolishment of slavery, they moved to wage slave labor, which most Americans unconsciously commit their daily lives to when they go to work every day. For the Afrikan in America who was supposed to be free, there were still great and many challenges. Jim Crow laws enforced and justified plenty of reasons to capture and imprison men and women, who were officially considered free, for crimes of all sorts. You could be captured and imprisoned for things like looking at a European (white person), spitting on the sidewalk, talking too loud or walking on the wrong side of the street – almost anything would give way to your imprisonment. Lawmakers and those who were displeased with slavery being supposedly abolished understood that they would lose money. Who would harvest their crops? Who would till their lands? Who would be the mammies for their children? Who would they release their sexual desires on? Who would they enjoy torturing? Who could they maim? No more slaves meant an end to the lifestyle they so enjoyed. This made them angry and furious. There has to be a way around this, they figured. With anger, rage and a well thought out plan to imprison former slaves, they won again. Imprisoned people, particularly those of African descent, would be forced to work in coal mines, railroads, as indentured servants for alleged unpaid taxes or debt, and things of that nature for all the days of their lives. The only difference between these prisoners sent to work on a plantation after the Civil War – in a system known as convict leasing – and the slaves they had been before the Civil War is their stripes. Many of us were subjected to convict leasing, a system of penal labor practiced in the Southern United States. Convict leasing provided prisoner labor to private parties, such as plantation owners and corporations, such as the Tennessee Coal and Iron Co. The lessee was responsible for feeding, clothing and housing the prisoners just as they had in the centuries that they held slaves. The state of Louisiana leased out convicts as early as 1844, but the system expanded all through the South with the emancipation of slaves at the end of the American Civil War in 1865. In 1898 some 73 percent of Alabama’s entire annual state revenue came from convict leasing. Capitalist wealth since then has continued to grow due to prison slave labor. As of 2014, 37 percent of the prison population consists of New Afrikans. This is not by chance. Mass incarceration is steadily increasing as the laws are strategically in place to incarcerate men and women on a daily basis – just the same as the Jim Crow laws that were in place not so long ago. The slavery-for-convicts clause in the 13th Amendment safeguards, protects and gives the right to profiteers, stakeholders, corporations and government entities to use slave labor for profit and refuse to be morally responsible for the injustice of slavery. They lose no sleep at night behind the idea that we are still slaves just like the old days. This is not a scene out of ancient history. Prison slavery is rampant today but rarely as visible as this. Another example of the past that wasn’t so long ago operating under the same amendment are chain gangs. A chain gang is a group of prisoners chained together to perform menial or physically challenging work as a form of punishment. Such punishment might include repairing buildings, building roads or clearing land. This system also existed primarily in the Southern United States and by 1955 had been phased out nationwide, with Georgia the last state to abandon the practice. Chain gangs were reintroduced by a few states during the “get tough on crime” 1990s, with Alabama being the first state to revive them, in 1995. The experiment ended after about one year in all states except Arizona, where in Maricopa County inmates can still volunteer for a chain gang to earn credit toward a high school diploma or avoid disciplinary lockdowns for rule infractions. The introduction of chain gangs into the United States began shortly after the Civil War. The Southern states needed finances and public works to be performed. Using prisoners as slave labor was a way to do it for free. This information isn’t hard to find; I got the above on Wikipedia. I hope that you are uncomfortable now, but I am not done. So that wasn’t so long ago. America is built off of big business. Here are a few of big businesses that are a part of most citizens’ everyday lives and that use prisoners as slave labor, legally: Victoria’s Secret, BP, Whole Foods, AT&T, Bank of America, Bayer, Cargill, Caterpillar, Chevron, Chrysler, Costco, John Deere, Eli Lilly and Company, Exxon Mobil, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson and Johnson, K-Mart, Koch Industries, McDonald’s, Merck, Microsoft, Motorola, Nintendo, Pfizer, Procter & Gamble, Pepsi, ConAgra Foods, Shell, Starbucks, UPS, Verizon, Walmart and Wendy’s. Most men and women in prison make anywhere from 25 cents per hour up to $1.15 per hour. This is the true meaning of “Made in America” when we see it on many of our product labels. This legalized slavery is often called insourcing. Insourcing is the most cost effective way for the capitalist to keep production costs low and profit high, without suffering criticism for outsourcing, sending jobs overseas. Imagine how sad Ronald McDonald would be if McDonald’s had to pay real wages for its products produced by prisoners working for pennies an hour. Boycott McDonald’s and tell them you’ll come back when they stop using prison slave labor. They can keep America great by utilizing that slavery-for-convicts clause in the 13th Amendment. McDonald’s, known for serving over 68 million customers a day, is the world’s most successful fast food franchise. Did you know that prisoners manufacture the plastic cutlery, containers and uniforms? McDonald’s also uses prison slave labor to produce frozen foods. Prisoners process beef for patties. They also process bread, milk and chicken products. Another added incentive for the greedy amongst us is the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC), which gives employers a tax credit of $2,400 for every work-release inmate they employ as a reward for hiring “risky target groups.” It’s also an added plus when the employer doesn’t have to provide things like vacation days and sick days, 401k retirement plans, or medical and health benefits. Look at all the money that is being saved by using the slave labor of prisoners instead of using the labor of ordinary wage slaves in the work force. Prison slave labor is the way to go for greedy employers. For workers trying to support their families, it means depressed wages or unemployment. Guess what else is made in prisons – U.S. military equipment, a billion-dollar industry. There are also all sorts of everyday items; the list goes on and on. Word on the street is that prisoners are even raising seeing-eye dogs for blind people. UNICOR proudly displays this picture of a woman prisoner, a slave laborer. Aside from the private corporations, there are even larger entities profiting off prisoner slave labor that you must be made aware of. One is UNICOR, a very guilty party in this modern day slavery here in Amerikkka. Federal Prison Industries, also known as UNICOR or FPI, is a corporation created in 1934 and owned by the federal government to oversee prisoner slave labor and set the condition and wage standards for prisoners working in federal prisons. UNICOR’s official reason for being is that in exchange for their slave labor, prisoners are given “vocational training.” Yet the workplace conditions are often appalling, and the transfer of skills to the private sector is dubious. UNICOR operates many call centers. “When you call a company or government agency for help, there’s a good chance the person on the other end of the line is a prison inmate,” NBC News reports. In the first half of 2016, UNICOR generated $231 million in sales. Since 2014, UNICOR has focused on employing prisoners within two years of release; in 2015, 24 percent of the Bureau of Prisons population was that close to release, and UNICOR’s workforce was approximately 30,000. The workers produce about 175 different types of products and services, including clothing and textiles, electronics, fleet management and vehicular components, industrial products, office furniture, recycling activities, and services including data entry and encoding. Prison slavery: Prisoners are driven to work in the fields of another former plantation in Texas, now a prison known as the Ellis Unit. – Photo courtesy The Marshall Project Another expendable prison worker – or slave – Danny Lyon dies of heat exhaustion at the Ellis Unit in Texas in 1942. According to Prison Policy Initiative, UNICOR pays from 23 cents to $1.15 per hour. Workers in state prisons make an average of 59 cents an hour. Prisoners in two state, Georgia and Texas, are paid nothing at all. A 1977 Supreme Court decision made it illegal for prisoners to form labor unions. So I ask you, if UNICOR in federal prisons and the state prison systems are supposed to be about vocational training and reentry into society, why are prisoners making under $2 an hour? Why aren’t they at least making minimum wage with that money put away in an account to be there upon their release along with other earned incentives? The answer: That would be a service to humanity and a service to humanity would be a blow to capitalism. The cheapest way is the best way. Cheap and free labor keeps capitalists’ bellies fat and pockets full while we the people starve and stay broke and live off of crumbs like, you know, slaves. That is the way the system of slavery works. Get it? Got it? Good. Lastly, I must mention Corrections Corporation of America (CCA). CCA owns and manages private prisons and detention centers. One of its founders is Thomas W. Beasley, a leader in the Republican Party. It received its initial investment in 1983 from Hospital Corporation of America founder Jack C. Massey, the Tennessee Valley Authority and Vanderbilt University. As of 2015, the company is the largest private corrections company in the United States. It manages more than 65 correctional and detention facilities with a capacity of more than 90,000 beds in 19 states and the District of Columbia. The company’s revenue in 2012 exceeded $1.7 billion, according to Wikipedia. “The High Cost of Cheap Detentions” by Edwin S. Rubenstein, quotes Prudential Securities saying about CCA: “It takes time to bring inmate population levels up to where they cover costs. Low occupancy is a drag on profits … Company earnings would be strong if CCA succeeded in ramping up population levels in its new facilities at an acceptable rate.” Angola, Louisiana’s largest prison, is an 18,000-acre former slave plantation, worked today by enslaved prisoners who are the descendants of the slaves who worked it before the Civil War. CCA’s prime objective is to KEEP THE PRISON FULL! They are needing you to be there. You are to be locked behind bars. This is the goal. This is the mandate. In 2012, CCA sent a letter to prison officials in 48 states, offering to buy prisons from these states in exchange for a 20-year management contract and a guaranteed occupancy rate of 90 percent. Community organizations have criticized the proposals, arguing that the contractual obligations of states to fill the prisons to 90 percent occupancy is poor public policy that could force communities into creating criminals, writes Chris Kirkham in “With States Facing Shortfalls, Private Corporation Offers Cash for Prisons,” a story posted Feb. 14, 2012, in the Huffington Post. THE RALLY CRY IS KEEP PRISONS FULL – maintaining and increasing mass incarceration. So I urge you to not only open your ears and your eyes, but I urge you to open your mouths and use your hands and your legs and all of your might to abolish the slavery-for-convicts clause by amending the 13th Amendment. I beg of you, if you have any sense of right from wrong, to challenge this system and bring an end to slavery once and for all. You must get involved, and there are many things that you can do. You must support the strikers right now. They need you. They need us. You must deliver a gut busting blow to corporations like McDonald’s and continue to expose their fallacies so that people will stop buying their products and take off their mask. It is our duty. You must remember that if not you, your child and/or other loved ones will be next. Write us a letter at George Jackson University and ask about other ways you can get involved. Call and ask what’s to be done. You can very well be pulled over, forced to get out of your car, and the next thing you know you are dead or in jail. If you are imprisoned, you just may become a 2016 slave; it’s real in the field. Tim Anderson reminds us that this is “The Unites States of Incarceration.” The U.S. has a huge per capita prison population, second only to the Seychelles, a group of islands in the Indian Ocean with a total population of 92,000 which imprisons many Somali pirates. Although only 5 percent of the world’s population lives in the U.S., this country incarcerates 25 percent of the world’s prisoners. Racism, drug laws, mandatory minimum sentencing and, of course, privatization of prisons all play a part. The partnership of the U.S. government with big business allows prisoners to be used as slave labor, another great incentive for filling prisons. Prison overcrowding is common. Instead of helping and rehabilitating people, the U.S. uses them for profit – another grotesque feature of a capitalist system fixated on making money over everything else. You must remember this as you go about your daily routine. Don’t be comfortable. You should be mad; you should be angry. Michael Leibowitz writes about the nature of capitalism in his book, “The Socialist Alternative: Real Human Development”: “The logic of capital generates a society in which all human values are subordinated to the search for profits. … Rather than building a cohesive and caring society, capital tears society apart. It divides workers and pits them against one another as competitors to reduce any challenge to its rule and its bottom line. Precisely because human beings and nature are mere means to capital’s goal, it destroys what Marx called the original sources of wealth – human beings and nature.” Don’t let capitalism make you into a monster. The monster of all monsters is ignoring that there is a problem. If you don’t work to eradicate these crimes against humanity and you consciously know they exist, doing nothing at all … SHAME ON YOU.

California’s “liberal” attorney general opposed reducing vastly overcrowded prisons in California for fear the state would have to pay real wages to fight its wildfires. Though extremely dangerous, firefighting is considered a premium job in California for prisoners, and most of those chosen are not people of color. - Tweet More Pocket Share on Tumblr Print Related Tags Filed Under: Prison Stories Tags: “get tough on crime” 1990s • “The High Cost of Cheap Detentions” by Edwin S.

September 10 2016 at 10:00am By Martinne Geller and Randy Fabi REUTERS A saleswoman from Wardah cosmetics, an Indonesian brand specialising in products for Muslim women, attends to a customer at a sales booth in a mall in Jakarta, Indonesia. File picture: Beawiharta London/Jakarta - Some of the world's biggest consumer groups are making halaal face creams and shampoos for Indonesia ahead of a new labelling law, part of a broader push to cater to growing Muslim populations as sales in many Western markets slow. Unilever, Beiersdorf and L'Oreal are among the multinationals converting their supply chains for the world's biggest Muslim-majority nation. The law, the first of its kind, requires food to be labelled halaal or not in 2017, followed by toiletries in 2018 and medicines in 2019. The companies say demand for beauty products that are halaal, or target specific issues like veiled hair, will grow as the Muslim middle class grows. They note that Indonesia could influence other countries such as Malaysia where halaal products made locally or by small, niche companies are also popular. Halaal certification is official recognition that a product was manufactured in keeping with Islamic sharia law. This means it must not contain traces of pork, alcohol or blood, and must be made on factory lines free of contamination risk, including from cleaning. Makers of cosmetics and toiletries say the burden is more administrative than financial, and therefore see compliance as unlocking new revenue streams. “It's an enabler to do business in certain areas of the world,” said Dirk Mampe of German chemicals company BASF, which sells ingredients to toiletries manufacturers and now has 145 of them certified halaal. The halaal ingredients do not carry premium price tags, he said. “There is a trend that these halaal products are being requested more and more, and the importance of being able to supply them is increasing.” More than 1.5 billion people around the world are Muslim, accounting for about a quarter of the global population. Halaal cosmetics were estimated to make up 11 percent of a global halaal market worth more than $1 trillion in 2015, according to Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting. Market research firm TechNavio sees halaal personal care products' sales growing 14 percent per year until 2019, outpacing the broader market. Not-so-secret formula French cosmetics giant L'Oreal already has a halaal-certified factory in Indonesia that supplies the domestic market and its Southeast Asian neighbours. Most products under its Garnier brand, from face washes to skin lightening creams, are halaal-certified, a spokeswoman said. The personal care industry already depends largely on plant-derived ingredients, so the rules for halaal often affect production more than formulation. But certification can get complicated. For example, the maker of an Indonesian skin cream with a dozen ingredients from around the world would need to give Indonesian authorities proof from other certification bodies that each ingredient was made in a halaal way. Malaysia-based DagangHalaal has made a business from that complexity by establishing an online database of halaal certificates to ease their exchange and expedite the process for applicants. As of February, it said 38 out of over 120 certification bodies worldwide had signed up. The company, which also runs a halaal e-commerce site, reported 2015 revenue of 5.6 million Malaysian ringgit ($1.4 million), up 64 percent year-on-year. It raised 3.6 million pounds ($4.7 million) from this year's London stock listing, and is betting that halaal cosmetics will gain traction beyond their current strongholds of Indonesia and Malaysia. “halaal certification is a requirement that might be put in place by other countries in the future,” Joerg Karas, general manager of Schwan-Stabilo Cosmetics, said in a statement last month. The German company, which is ready to offer halaal-certified products to customers such as L'Oreal and Procter & Gamble, said it is “well-equipped for this niche market”. Non-halaal products will remain available in Indonesia following the labelling law, but may meet a backlash. “The average Muslim consumer in Indonesia is not going to buy something that effectively says prohibited on it,” said Abdalhamid Evans of halaal consultancy firm Imarat Consultants. Unilever, which owns five of Indonesia's top 10 beauty and personal care brands, says all nine of its factories there already meet halaal standards and that it is currently working with third-party suppliers of imported ingredients. Alan Jope, who runs Unilever's personal care business from Singapore, told Reuters the cost of certification was “not material”. Muslim values Competition with homegrown rivals steeped in local tradition can be fierce, especially when it comes to regulation. But Jope said the key for multinationals like Unilever - with global marketing and development teams - is understanding Muslim values generally and how they influence habits in specific markets with different cultures and ethnicities. “Some (values) are common across Muslim countries,” he said, noting that about 90 percent of Muslim consumers say faith influences their brand choices. “But there's quite substantial differences between how a Muslim woman in Indonesia and a Muslim woman in Saudi Arabia express their faith and how that impacts their beauty regimes.” He guessed that one third of the top 20 markets for Unilever's 20 billion euros-per-year business were countries with large Muslim populations, from India to Nigeria. He said better meeting their needs was a top strategic priority. To that end, Unilever has introduced products such as a gel body moisturiser that absorbs quickly beneath long undergarments and a long-lasting toothpaste appealing to those fasting for Ramadaan. Like rival Henkel, it sells a line of shampoo for veiled hair, but Jope said the industry needs to improve its advertising, such as by featuring more women in hijabs. “We need to be doing a better job reflecting Muslim values in our brand communication,” he said.

In this episode of Marketing Nerds, Boz Boschen, Digital Media Director for ndp, joined me to talk about how far social advertising has come over the last several years. We also chatted about where it’s going, and how those in the advertising sphere are adapting. Here are a few transcribed excerpts from our discussion, but make sure to listen to the podcast to hear everything! How Social Media Advertising has Evolved Within digital media, it’s always interesting to see how consumer habits change over time. Looking at the pace of change, it always seems like the thing that pops up this weekend becomes popular where it’s completely unexpected. Of course, it’s very hard to look into that crystal ball and see where things will be in five or seven years. I think where we are today is really the age of platforms, as everyone is saying. It’s really becoming more about adjusting the ad experience to match that environment in social media. We know that users are spending vast amounts of time on Facebook. Noteworthy in the last week that Facebook weighed in on the ad blocking discussion and has said that they have a point of view on that. Of course, in a very Facebook way, it’s very tech-focused and tech solution rather than the overall philosophy of there’s a value exchange here. In order to get your social media fix, there needs to be some ads to help support it. It’s been really interesting to see what’s happened. Again, I think where we are is less transactional, more relational. Distinguishing Good Content Facebook, as a publicly traded company, looks at it and says “Here’s our short-term goal. We’ve got some things that we need to achieve with our revenue.” Also, measuring that against at what point are we going to turn off users? Do we see their time spent start to drop because we’re forcing more ads into the experience at the detriment of their overall use of Facebook? I think that they’re looking at all of that and trying to decide what’s the right role with this and those sorts of headlines or what’s getting people to engage. They’re experimenting as well with the ad types and the units that they’re employing. I think that they’re trying to test what’s the right environment in the role of the advertising. Smartphones being ubiquitous, what’s the right ad experience on mobile? It’s not going to be that kind of display banner from desktops shrunk down into a smaller space. How do we build something that’s immersive and full-screen and engaging and get somebody to raise their hand while they’re looking for that dopamine fix and scrolling through Facebook? Let’s give them a good experience here and let them go further on their own. I think it’s an interesting way to look at it. We’ve seen success with that for some of our clients and not repurposing creative, but really building something that’s native to the platform. It even plays into digital video. When you look at digital video and you’re going to run it in the Facebook environment, I think everybody now realizes it’s auto-play, it’s silent, it’s subtitled. What’s the right approach for that? How do we load our branding front end? Finding the Most Accessible Platform for Your Content There was Kodak. Now there’s really no longer Kodak, but there’s Instagram. We’re still interested in photography and photos and sharing things and creating memories and preserving them. I think that’s the overall point that there’s some innate human things that are going to continue. It’s just what is the platform. It may be fluid and it might be Facebook. It might be a little bit different. It might be something new that’s still in development. The tricky thing with digital is really overall tracking. That’s a question that comes up from clients all the time is what is the overall spend. What percentage of our budget should be in digital? How do we decide that for social media? Social can be very hard to track and digital as well. Transformation in Media Usage I guess in the overall industry trend over the last five years there’s was sort of a race in marketing tech and ad tech to add more tracking, to go deeper and understand these discreet segments and hyper-targeting populations and looking at everything at the most granular level. Now we’re hearing Procter & Gamble’s pulling back in a sense. Some of this could be a negotiating power as they’re looking at their overall budget with Facebook. I think the point can also be true that as they’re looking at Facebook overall and saying here is two hundred data points against each of these people, how do we then want to divide up our brand spend for direct response? Everything is infinitely measurable, but is that really the way to invest in the platform and the way to approach the audience in that transactional manner? Whatever happens, we’re still going to be looking at a sales funnel to some degree. Is Social Media Worth Investing Your Time and Money? I think it’s really talking to the client about their own goals, their target, understanding within that full target analysis, who are these people, what are their typical media behaviors, weighing social media against everything else that they’re doing in their daily lives and then the budget. How much budget is there and how far can we stretch it? If we look at those priorities, the audience might be fifty-five and older. They’re primarily broadcast, primetime viewers with a little bit of light online. Maybe they’re checking their bank statements and the weather or Facebook to follow-up with the grandkids, whatever it is. Again, it’s unique to each budget, each brand, each target. Making Your Brand Constantly Top of Mind Everybody has been talking about Olympics for the last week since it wrapped [a few weeks ago]. I think NBC is learning some hard lessons about trying to force fit content into the traditional broadcast primetime model and looking at an opportunity that was served up for a multitude of sports where people can go as deep as they want and follow everything as it’s happening. We do live in that world now where everybody gets breaking updates in their smartphones. If you’ve downloaded the app, you’ve opted in for the notifications; you’re going to see the notifications throughout the day. This broadcast partner has decided that they’re going to repackage the content and air it in primetime. I think there’s a limitation there in what they were expecting to happen with the TV viewership that didn’t really match what they were doing online. I think that just allowing the user to be free to engage where they want to and on their own terms and to go as deep as they want. What are you going to lose by having them go further in digital? You’re giving them the content they want. It’s going to trend on social regardless. Don’t fight it. Go with it.

Lee Murphy SHARE × Facebook Twitter Text / SMS LinkedIn Google + Email Photo by Manuel Martinez Dave Dalesandro, left, and Sam Youssef, co-owners of Jet Brite Car Wash in Carol Stream About all those new car washes in your neighborhood Can anybody turn a profit washing cars for $3, or even $4? Entrepreneurs seem to think so, as they rush to build big discount auto cleaning facilities in and around Chicago. Jet Brite Car Wash, which started in 2000 with a single shop in Addison, opened its fifth car wash, in Carol Stream, last year and is opening another in Bolingbrook by December. After that, co-owners Dave Dalesandro and Sam Youssef plan to add a location every year. The cost is imposing—the Bolingbrook outpost, complete with conveyors, is budgeted at $5 million— considering that Jet Brite charges a scant $3 for each exterior wash. "We were the first guys to drive prices down to $3 around Chicago, and we have no plans to increase that price," Dalesandro says. "Some new investors are coming into the industry with the idea of charging $5 or $6 as a base price. If so, they'll have to deal with us as competitors." Few car wash operators seem to be shrinking from that challenge. Most are bulking up by establishing more low-price, high-volume locations, with the prospect of what was once a mom-and-pop industry dominated by single wash owners morphing into chain formats. Hinsdale-based Fuller's Carwash & Car Care, which has been around since shortly after World War II, now has 16 washes, including new ones in New Lenox and Chicago's Little Village. Three more are under construction, with locations in Elgin and Montgomery due to open before Christmas. "Things have gotten crazy in this business," says Robert Fuller, a senior family member who manages the Geneva wash. "Everybody and his brother seems to want to build a car wash these days. Our goal is to beat the others to the best locations." The Fullers will have to hustle. Phillip Degeratto, owner of Buddy Bear Car Wash, opened his sixth facility, near Beverly on the South Side, in early August after opening a location in Bellwood a year ago. He's looking for more sites and so far isn't worried about the prospect of overbuilding in the sector. "If anything, the West and South sides of Chicago and nearby suburbs, where I concentrate, are underserved," says Degeratto, who charges $3.99 for a basic wash and counts on 140 cars an hour and 1,500 a day moving through his 140-foot tunnels to drive his profit. There are roughly 15,000 car washes grossing $7 billion altogether annually in the U.S., according to First Research. Eric Wulf, CEO of the International Carwash Association, based in Chicago, estimates that 600 washes have opened in each of the past two years, amounting to more new development than the industry has seen in over a decade. Attendance at his association's annual convention soared to 8,000 in May from 5,500 in 2010. The industry, Wulf says, hit a low point in the recession of 2008, when many people decided they would no longer pay the standard $10 and more for a wash, setting in motion a discounting wave. Car wash owners laid off workers, investing instead in more automated washing and drying equipment, and dropped their prices by 60 percent and more. YEP, MILLENNIALS Today it helps that millennials seem disinclined to spend their weekends washing and waxing their cars, Wulf adds. "We did a national survey in 1994 that found 48 percent of Americans went to car washes. In our latest survey that was 72 percent," he says. "As a result, this is the best period for growth this industry has ever seen." It's been a good period for suppliers, too, like AVW Equipment in Maywood, which produces everything from conveyors to chemicals and brushes. Velimir "Willie" Vidakovich, a co-owner, reports that revenue has jumped 10 percent annually for each of the past five years after falling more than 20 percent during the recession. "When we started this company in 1973, most Americans still washed their cars at home," he says. "Now we see people going not once but twice a week to get their cars washed." Nevertheless, some experts warn that supply will soon overwhelm demand. Bob Roman, a car wash consultant in Clearwater, Fla., estimates that the best facilities wash 100,000 cars a year or more and gross $1 million. From that, they might net $150,000 a year in profit. But in many cities, he says, operators are no longer meeting those benchmarks. "Atlanta is already oversaturated with car washes, and the business is ruined there. The same will be coming to California," he says. "So far in Chicago, there seems to be opportunities for guys to build more washes and still make money." That hasn't escaped the attention of outsiders. The nation's biggest chain, Mister Car Wash in Tucson, Ariz., with 188 locations, has acquired three facilities in the western suburbs. Waterway Carwash of St. Louis, which has 20 locations spread between Ohio and Colorado, opened its first local wash, in Northbrook, a year ago. "We hope to have another wash open somewhere on the North Shore by next year," says CEO Robert Dubinsky. There have already been some missteps by big companies hoping to expand regionally or even nationally. Procter & Gamble opened washes around Chicago with the Mr. Clean brand more than five years ago but now has pulled back and operates in a narrow swath of Georgia. Turtle Wax, based in Willowbrook, made a big splash in opening washes featuring its products two decades ago but has ended up closing nearly all of them. Still, Jet Brite's Dalesandro expects more big money to enter the industry. "Every attempt to build a national car wash chain in the past has failed," he says. "Now the business is becoming so automated that eventually we'll see a Wall Street group figure out how to do it, and they'll build the first publicly traded car wash company. The industry will only get bigger from here on." Economy and Economic Development Small Business Transportation Automobiles News Today's Crain's Get our daily roundup of important business news.
