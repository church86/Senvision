Bronze medalist Kim Rhode on Aug. 12. Photographer: Sam Greenwood/Getty Images Landing a big-name sponsor might be the bigger feat. In the year leading up to Rio 2016, Rhode’s agent Patrick Quinn pitched her to around 20 companies that back the Olympics. None were convinced. “The big mystery is how someone like Kim isn’t part of the Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and the Olympics sponsor push,’’ Quinn said by phone from Chicago.“It would be nice to have an Olympic sponsor recognize the magnitude of her accomplishment.’’ Coca-Cola Co. didn’t respond to a request for comment, and Procter & Gamble Co.’s spokesperson Damon Jones said in an e-mail the company receives hundreds of sponsorship requests so it must be selective. Rhode and other shooters on Team USA think the reason they’re passed over is obvious. The rise in gun violence and mass shootings in the US have attached a stigma to shooting as a sport, they say. So while companies like Winchester, Beretta and Otis Technology support Rhode, she doesn’t have a single sponsor from outside the firearm industry. The same is true for USA Shooting, even though the sport has since 2000 been the fifth-highest medal producer for the US team at Summer Olympics. The very first gold medal for any sport awarded in Rio went to 19-year-old Ginny Thrasher, competing in her Olympics debut. Start your day with what’s moving markets.

American television audiences don’t tend to watch shooting – or, for that matter, a number of other sports. “The biggest challenge is limited exposure,” said Peter Carlisle, head of the Olympic Sports and Action division at Octagon Worldwide. “If the sport itself doesn’t provide a consistent platform for the athletes to become recognizable and maintain relevance, there’s limited value to a sponsor.” What’s more, noted Scott Becher, the executive vice president of sports and entertainment at Zimmerman Advertising, a lot of Americans own firearms, so the potential affinity exists. A Costly Sport The difference for shooters is the cost of training. Competition-level firearms price between $8,000-20,000. Between ammunition, clay pigeons and range fees, a day of training can run as high as $450. “It really adds up,’’ said Vincent Hancock, one of Rhode’s teammates. “I’ve only found two sports that are more expensive -- anything to do with a horse, and car racing.’’ The US Olympic Committee helps foot the bill. Because of shooting’s high potential to medal, USA Shooting received $2.5 million in 2015, third-most among summer sports behind swimming and track and field. Still, the ammunition provided by the federation doesn’t always cover athlete’s needs. The day before departing for Rio, for example, Rhode shot 450 targets, she said. Similar Challenges As for Hancock, on Saturday he will attempt to win a gold medal in his third consecutive Olympics for skeet shooting. Even as one of the sport’s favorites, Hancock still struggles to prevail upon potential backers who aren’t tied in some way to the firearm industry. “A lot of times they say, well, we really like you, you’re great and your credentials speak for themselves, but we’re not sure how we can really fit you in,’’ Hancock said. “It seems like they want to, but don’t want to get caught up in the media backlash that may arise if something were to come about with, say, one of the shootings.’’ Shooters in other countries have faced similar challenges. Even in Italy, where the national shooting federation claims about 500,000 members – its U.S. counterpart has about 5,250 – the team struggled to transcend sponsors’ fears about firearms. “You talk about rifles and pistols and people are afraid, especially in Europe with the recent terrorism,’’ said Luciano Rossi, an Italian senator who is also president of the country’s shooting federation, and also vice-president of the international shooting federation. “We must offer a new image of our sport. If the spectators know our sport, they understand and love us, and if they love us, the sponsors come.’’ Watch Next: Athletes Have Always Cheated, And They May Never Stop Athletes Have Always Cheated, And They May Never Stop Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

A verba publicitária investida na ferramenta de segmentação de público será redirecionada para outras opções do Facebook. Segundo o diretor de marketing da P&G, Marc Pritchard, o investimento no recurso, um dos mais caros do Facebook, não estava garantindo resultados uma vez que acabava por deixar de mostrar resultados para outros públicos. O esquema de segmentação da audiência da rede social permite que o anunciante mire em consumidores específicos. No caso da Procter & Gamble, empesa dona de uma vasta gama e produtos domésticos, era possível anunciar fraldas para futuros pais ou purificador de ar para donos de animais, por exemplo. A marca usou a segmentação por dois anos, mas os resultados mostraram uma estagnação nas vendas, o que a levou a repensar a estratégia de anúncio digital. Para o Wall Street Journal, um porta-voz do Facebook afirmou que o movimento é natural. De acordo com ele, a relação entre as duas empresas sempre foi de aprendizado mútuo.

The company also expects that Cyr will join the company’s board of directors at that time. Cyr, formerly of Palmerton, joins Freshpet with more than 30 years of experience in key consumer packaged foods leadership roles at Sunny Delight Beverages Company and Procter & Gamble Company. Most recently, he served for almost 12 years as president and chief executive officer of Sunny Delight, a leading producer, distributor and marketer of juices, juice drinks and flavored waters in North America serving a wide range of customers in the grocery, club, mass merchandise, convenience, dollar and drug channels. While at Sunny Delight, Cyr oversaw the company’s multinational operations, building a team of over 600 employees with operations in eight countries and successfully engineered the company’s turnaround plan returning the company to growth and profitability. Cyr brings a strong track record of strategic leadership to Freshpet. Over his nearly 20-year tenure at Procter & Gamble beginning in 1985, Cyr held numerous senior executive roles, including most recently serving as vice president and general manager of the North American Juice Business and Global Nutritional Beverages. In this position, he led a team of more than 500 employees across five manufacturing facilities and two continents. He led brand growth and marketing over the years for leading packaged foods brands including Crisco and Duncan Hines. Cyr served as a board and executive committee member of the Grocery Manufacturers Association, a position he held since 2002. He has been a member of the board of directors of American Beverage Association since 2007, and on the executive committee since 2012.

P&G moving 850 jobs Downtown Bowdeya Tweh , btweh@enquirer.com 8:37 a.m. EDT August 13, 2016 Buy Photo Procter & Gamble headquarters in downtown Cincinnati (Photo: Enquirer file/Cara Owsley)Buy Photo Procter & Gamble is relocating 850 workers to Downtown Cincinnati from its Winton Hills campus about 10 miles away. P&G officials told employees about the move previously, but the company confirmed the plans to media Friday. The move is expected to begin in fall 2017. Of the 850 employees, contractors and suppliers at the Winton Hill Business Center that will move, 750 are P&G employees and 100 are contract workers, the company said. The Cincinnati-based consumer products giant is locating people inside P&G's Central Building on Sixth Street between Sycamore Street and Broadway, which company officials said has been underused. The vacant third and fourth floors are being renovated for the relocated workers, P&G spokesman Jeff LeRoy said. Most of the people being relocated Downtown work in Procter & Gamble's product supply organization, which handles planning and logistics for the company's North American operations. "The Winton Hill campus will retain portions of our baby, family and feminine care businesses, some of which are in Cincinnati and some of which are in the Finneytown neighborhood of Springfield Township," according to a company statement. The move doesn't change P&G's total headcount in Cincinnati. P&G employs about 10,000 people in Greater Cincinnati. The Winton Hills campus has about 18 buildings and the relocated employees will be vacating two of them, LeRoy said. He said the company wants to sell those buildings, but it has about 18 months to consider its options.

Some are known for their unique combination of natural ingredients, while others contain nutrients like vitamins, and minerals promising to give you younger looking skin. These days, women understand the advantages of choosing the right makeup and beauty products. They are not ready to compromise on quality no matter if they have to spend hundreds of bucks on a single item. The trend of using makeup has become common, so every makeup brand enlisted here is known for its remarkable range of products. We are confident that these companies will give a new horizon to the world by 2017. Olay Lipsticks, moisturizing creams, and personal care products of Olay are world renowned. It is an outstanding and famous #Skincare line of the US. According to a report, Olay is a top ranked company of Procter & Gamble. During the 2015 fiscal year, this firm generated more than $80 billion revenues. With the passage of time, Olay has expanded its network and has included total effect moisturizers, body lotions, white radiance creams, nail paints, lip glosses, and other items in its range. For the women who are conscious about their beauty, Olay has presented a series of anti-aging creams. The most interesting thing is that this brand’s makeup items are least expensive.

The Enquirer looks back on FC Cincinnati's humble beginnings. The Enquirer/Pat Brennan FC Cincinnati transitioned into its permanent home on the third floor of 14 E. Fourth St. in downtown Cincinnati in late September. (Photo: Provided/Jeff Berding) No office space. Speculative earnings models. A brand new lease to play soccer in the University of Cincinnati's football stadium, but no players to take the field. No coach to coach the imaginary squad. Forget Major League Soccer – this newly-founded United Soccer League project needed colors and a logo. That was Futbol Club Cincinnati as recently as spring 2015. Friday marks one year since FC Cincinnati went public, and most have come to appreciate the team within the context of raucous scenes at Nippert Stadium this spring and summer. In the short time some fans have been tuned in, the club's grabbed international attention for their skyrocketing attendance figures. They're the third division outfit that drew 35,061 for a friendly against a trendy English Premier League club. Most of all, FC Cincinnati's the startup franchise that's injected itself into the MLS expansion conversation. CINCINNATI.COM FC Cincinnati receives praise at MLS All-Star Game But FC Cincinnati's path to success was forged when almost no one here was looking, before almost anyone knew soccer was coming to the Queen City. It wasn't that long ago the club's future was being etched out in note pads by four men working out of East Side coffee shops. A fridge full of beer: FC Cincinnati’s first employee and the pre-launch days It was clear FC Cincinnati would be a "go" for 2016 as the team polished off its 15-year lease to play at Nippert Stadium in spring 2015. But there was work to do through the summer months leading up to the planned August launch, and President and General Manager Jeff Berding wasn't leaving his post with the Cincinnati Bengals' front office until Aug. 3. Enter Dan McNally, the club’s first-ever full-time employee. McNally was hired by Berding in May 2015. He carried the torch on a number of initiatives through the summer as Berding finished out his time with the Bengals. McNally studied the USL's best practices thoroughly, researched housing for FC Cincinnati players and helped birth concepts like The Bailey, the supporters section in Nippert's north end (originally, the section was slated to be called "The Legion." Nippert's horseshoe end would eventually receive that title). With no office space to call his own, McNally built a foundation for the club while working out of Cincinnati coffee shops. Bruegger's Bagels on Columbia Parkway in Mount Lookout was a favorite work space for him. Berding also hosted meetings at his home in the early mornings and evenings and, eventually, the crowd around Berding's kitchen table grew to four main players. McNally and Berding were joined by ticketing and Nippert guru Jeff Smith, formerly UC's associate athletic director, and Gary De Jesus, a brand building expert from Procter and Gamble. De Jesus worked on consumer studies for the club and was instrumental in crafting the team’s colors and logos. Combined, these four were the early, proverbial "boots on the ground" for FC Cincinnati. They kept a shared vision for club moving in the right direction, Berding said. “We would meet a couple of times a week, famously in Jeff’s kitchen,” McNally said. “For a guy like myself from the northwest of England where soccer is everything, the idea of building a professional franchise is inspiring because there was nothing we couldn’t discuss. Every thought that we had between ourselves was worth discussing.” Berding’s fridge was always filled with beer – “He never let us down there. Always happy with the beer,” McNally said – but the meetings were still structured and professional. “Literally, there were four of us around a kitchen table and, I think, that’s a pretty strong comparison of where we started off from with great ambition and potential,” McNally said. “It was an inspiring time. You don’t get many opportunities in your life to be part of a startup with such ambition. “Having a beer. Building a professional soccer franchise," McNally said, laughing. Launch day and beyond After almost two decades on the job, Berding walked out of Paul Brown Stadium for the final time as a Bengals employee Aug. 3, 2015 – a mere nine days before FC Cincinnati went public.  (Photo: Provided/Jeff Berding) “Up until the last day, I tried to give an honest effort,” Berding said. “When I left, I joked that, ‘well, I have one job now’ because I was trying to pull all this (FC Cincinnati) stuff together while maintaining my commitment to the Bengals organization.” With McNally's assistance, the short gap between Berding's jobs didn't inhibit FC Cincinnati's ability to throw a notable launch ceremony. The  U.S. soccer community sat up and took notice when Carl Lindner III and John Harkes were introduced as the principle owner and head coach, respectively. Rumors circulated in soccer circles about those involved in FC Cincinnati, but few learned of Lindner's and Harkes' involvement until the launch news conference. “We were shooting for the moon with the launch," Berding said of the impact of the launch, which featured USL higher-ups, Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley and others. "We were going to send a message that we were going to do something completely different than had ever been suggested before in Cincinnati." FC Cincinnati made its desired launch-day splash, but there was still much work to be done. FC Cincinnati remained less a sports franchise and more a concept at this point. With the USL season about seven months away, pressure ratcheted up and things began to take shape across the organization. • In late September, the club transitioned its business operation into its permanent home in the third floor of 14 E. Fourth St. in late September, and more staff was added to fill out the space. • With the brick and mortar in place, Berding started to gain ground as the club’s general manager and began signing players. • McNally broadened his scope as vice president of operations to include the team’s travel arrangements, and locker room and player lounge layouts, among other things. • Mario Cicchinelli, head of sponsorships and corporate partnerships, helped Berding land the club's first sponsorship deals. UC Health signed on as the presenting sponsor and Toyota partnered with the club as its jersey, or "kit," sponsor. Dozens of additional partnerships would follow. • The first crop of player signings was introduced in November (and went on to comprise the majority of FC Cincinnati's current starting lineup). The club also held its first-ever open tryout the week before Thanksgiving. Successes were snowballing and it would soon carry over to the field. 'Divine providence': The USL season begins Even in preseason, it felt to some like special things were happening with FC Cincinnati. Something was up with this team. For the team’s first-ever game, a Feb. 21 preseason match against KR Reykjavic of Iceland, locals packed bars on both sides of the Ohio River to watch a shoddy livestream of an essentially meaningless game. Midfielder Corben Bone scored a surreal goal that would go on to be featured on ESPN that night. Then FC Cincinnati won the IMG Academy Suncoast Pro Classic, which included a late victory against star-studded New York City FC of MLS – more reason for the soccer-viewing public to take notice. In interviews, Carl Lindner III used the phrase "divine providence" to encapsulate this kind of inexplicable energy, excitement and success around the team. More and more, the team seemed preordained to be successful and make an impact. FC Cincinnati's first USL game was forgettable. The team lost, weather delayed the start and most could only view it on YouTube. But then the April 9 home opener against Charlotte Independence arrived. On a cold night, 14,658 packed into Nippert. Forward Sean Okoli scored a stunning, highlight reel goal in the first half, but it was the game-winning goal by Cincinnati native Austin Berry in the second half that signaled to McNally the first-year club had already achieved something special. "With Austin's diving header, I just looked up in the stands and said, 'this is it.' This is what we wanted to achieve," McNally said. "Everything about that night - that was the new standard." Since then, FC Cincinnati's shattered single-game and season attendance records for USL. The team is also a top competitor entering the home stretch of the USL's regular season. Year Two: More youth programs and possible new training ground FC Cincinnati's front office is already beginning to plan for its offseason, although there's still the matter of the USL playoffs to contend with. At this point, FC Cincinnati is a virtual lock to qualify for the Eastern Conference's eight-team, knockout-style tournament format. But once they get to the offseason, this much is certain: FC Cincinnati will expand aspects of its operation in year two. It's a matter of how much can be accomplished between November and January, McNally said. Nippert's soccer-minded renovations are scheduled to begin after UC's football team completes its slate of home games. That should begin in November with the upgrades tentatively scheduled to be ready by around April 1, Berding said. Expanding youth programming and improving the Cincinnati’s first-team training facilities – both issues that were researched during FC Cincinnati’s recent fact-finding mission at MLS All-Star Game in San Jose – will be emphasized this coming winter. Berding told The Enquirer Wednesday that former Wake Forest men’s soccer coach Nate Kish was added to FC Cincinnati’s technical staff in July. He'll act as a member of the coaching staff and head of scouting. Kish will look to build on the club’s first-ever foray into youth programming, which took place in July and saw some of the top-recommended youth players in Greater Cincinnati train with FC Cincinnati’s first team. The hope is to have a more structured summer program by next summer, but not a year-round development academy quite yet, Berding said. Upgrading FC Cincinnati's practice environment for 2017 is also a priority. Berding said he’s been approached by multiple parties about possible off-site training grounds, but added he and McNally aren’t close to making a decision about practice facilities for next season. Training at Nippert, as the club has this season, is still on the table. Improvements in these areas, particularly at Nippert and in the area of youth programming, would advance FC Cincinnati's increasingly strong argument for MLS expansion. Berding also mentioned another potential addition for the near future, pending on-field results. "We’ll have a trophy case here before too long," he said. 284 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE TOP VIDEOS Dodgers great Ralph Branca dies at 90 1:15 Top five college football games to watch in Week 13 2:20 Achieving the Dream - Charles Woodson 3:40 Statistical oddities from the NBA's first month 1:52 Why the Los Angeles Clippers are rolling 1:36 Notre Dame to vacate football wins from 2012 and 2013 1:15 Bruce Arena replaces Jurgen Klinsmann as USMNT coach 1:07 Celeb Pick 'Em with Miles Teller 3:25 How the NFL playoff picture looks after Week 11 1:37 NBA weekend in review: Clippers continue to roll 1:40 Doug Baldwin speaks out on community policing 3:32 Jurgen Klinsmann fired as USMNT coach 0:48 Week 11 NFL hot reads: Redskins building solid foundation 2:36 Jimmie Johnson wins record-tying seventh Sprint Cup title 1:00 Week 12 Amway Coaches Poll 1:14 NFL players must battle altitude and pollution in Mexico City 2:41 Numbers to know for the Chase for the Sprint Cup 1:23 Who is the favorite to win the Sprint Cup title? 1:08 What to watch for in Sprint Cup race at Homestead 1:27 Lorenzo's Locks: Week 11 NFL picks 1:59 Punting tips and dance moves with Marquette King 1:00 Reflecting on Tony Stewart's legacy in NASCAR 2:52 A timeline of Johnny Manziel’s troubled history 2:02 Fighters square off at UFC Fight Night 100 faceoffs 1:14 Mets pitcher Jeurys Familia pleads not guilty to domestic violence charge 0:50

Earlier this week, Simone and Team USA won a second consecutive team gold medal. Biles grew up in gymnastics, competing as a level 8 gymnast at the age of 10. By age 14, she had made her mark as an elite junior gymnast, finishing third in the all-around American Classic. Raised by her grandmother and grandfather, she was encouraged not to allow anything or anyone to stop her from attaining success. The very next year, she topped the medal podium with gold medals at not only the American Classic, but the Alamo Classic, the Houston National Invitational and the Secret U.S. Classic. Photo credit: Instagram – @SimoneBiles In 2013, she shined bright with all-around gold at the U.S P&G Championship and became the first African American Woman to win the all-around gold medal at the World Championship. In 2014 she was a repeat success, taking home gold at the World Championship in all-around competition, as well as the Secret U.S. Classic. In 2015, Biles became the first woman to win three consecutive World Championships and she earned her 10th gold medal, making her one of the world’s top gymnasts. Photo credit: Instagram – @SimoneBiles Biles qualified for the all-around competition after receiving scores of 15.6 on beam, 15.7 on floor, 16.0 on vault and 15.0 on uneven bars in the qualifying rounds of the Rio Olympic Games.

According to several former workers, roughly 70 employees were laid off at the end of July. The company, headquartered in Seattle, has eight locations in the United States, including New York, Denver and Atlanta. Its past clients include Procter & Gamble and Build-A-Bear. Possible was passed over for an $11 million contract with Smuckers, a company with which Possible has done business for at least 5 years. According to an April article in Ad Age, the J.M. Smucker Co. conducted a digital review of all 29 of its domestic brands, including the flagship Smucker's line. One former employee said the loss of the Smucker contract was "the last straw." Smucker did not respond to Enquirer requests for an interview. Management at Possible declined to be interviewed regarding the layoffs.

Spyros Lekkakos August 12, 2016 | CFO.com | US - Comments: 8 share Tweet Email Print - Print + Email this article To* Please enter your email address* Subject* Comments* Extending payment terms to 120 days or more frees up working capital for big companies. But it can also increase the financial stress on suppliers and ultimately lead to increased product costs. Although the tactic has attracted much criticism, research underway at the Zaragoza Logistics Center, Zaragoza, Spain, shows that delaying payments to creditors can actually benefit both buyers and suppliers. Spyros Lekkakos The number of large enterprises that have imposed less generous payment terms on suppliers has increased markedly over recent years. A recent article in the New York Times notes that European spirits company Diageo pays its bills in 90 days, and Mondelez, Mars, and Kellogg take 120 days to pay suppliers’ invoices. “The list of companies doing the same reads like a grocery store version of Who’s Who,” said the New York Times. By paying suppliers much later than previously, big companies can unlock cash in their supply chains. In 2013 Procter & Gamble introduced a 75-day payment period for suppliers, and added an estimated $1 billion to the company’s cash flow, reported the New York Times. But for many suppliers the tactic is a bitter pill to swallow, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). These companies are particularly vulnerable to market volatility, and are often unable to find cheap external financing owing to the continued fallout from the 2008 global financial crisis. It seems that SMEs have little choice but to make the best of an unfavorable situation, but there are better alternatives. In 2010 Unilever extended its payment terms from 30 days to 90 days. Even though industry was still reeling from the aftermath of the 2008 meltdown, Unilever achieved an increase in total turnover of 25%, as well as 50% and 60% increases in operating profit and investments in fixed assets within a three-year time frame. Moreover, while there were rumblings of discontent when the change was announced, supplier protests were relatively muted. The reason is that Unilever invested the funds freed up by its extended payment program in its supply chain. The efficiencies captured by Unilever were passed on to suppliers in the form of higher order volumes — in effect, a win-win. The availability of supply chain finance instruments such as reverse factoring (RF) also made it possible for Unilever to extend payment terms without punishing suppliers. RF is a vehicle for giving suppliers — especially SMEs — access to affordable financing. In a typical arrangement, a large company (the buyer) commits to paying invoices promptly to the factor (a bank) and the factor agrees to pay the supplier earlier than the due dates on its invoices to the buyer. The bank profits by charging fees for the service, the buyer benefits from the extended payment terms, and the supplier is able to get paid earlier and improve its cash-flow position. Most academic RF models show that when buyers associate their RF programs with terms extension, the value for their supply chain is lower than that achieved without the extension strategy. However, recent ZLC research shows that when the cost of raising funds — in the form of debt or equity — is high for buyers, extending payment terms can be economically efficient as long as the freed up cash is productively used. One such use: plant and equipment investment. There are many creative versions of RF financing. ZLC research shows that for SMEs, the instrument improves operational performance, mitigates the impact of market volatility on cash flow, and offers the potential to unlock more than 10% of an enterprise’s working capital. The RF route also has some significant downsides, however. It is effective when the credit spread is large. But when this is not the case, suppliers are advised to look for other sources of financing. And, of course, RF services come at a cost for both the buyer and the supplier. Therefore, when evaluating RF options, suppliers should keep in mind that the direct benefits gained from improved service levels and profitability are not the only factors they need to consider. They should also assess how the capital freed up by these programs can be put to work in other ways. The emergence of new variations on the RF theme, including open platforms that provide a wider choice of competing sources of finance, could change these tradeoffs. In addition, new fintech models such as blockchain have the potential to disrupt the RF market. There is a growing need for insights into better ways to manage working capital. The recently released annual working capital survey by REL, a division of The Hackett Group, which looks at the performance of 1,000 of the largest U.S. public companies during 2015, concludes: “Overall working capital performance continued to degrade, reaching poorest performance levels since the 2008 financial crisis.” Spyros Lekkakos, is a postdoctoral research fellow, at the Zaragoza Logistics Center, Zaragoza, Spain.

Sounds like the rich getting richer. You have the product, you have the money, so pay up. Stop using the little man’s money to make your money. Spin it the way you want, but to me this is BS. I guess paying bills properly has changed. Sounds like a Trump idea. Reply Tom Walsh said 08/17/16 20:18pm Obviously the author has not operated a business. We have many large customers pushing us out to 90 and 120 days before being paid, this makes it extremely hard on a business with 50 to 70 employees who are paid weekly, taxes that need to be paid weekly or face stiff government penalties. We have suppliers who also need to be paid. It only benefits the big multinationals who can afford to pay but do not. Cash flow is the lifeblood of a business, regardless of how well the financial statements look, if there is no cash on hand it spells the death of a business. Of course the banks may like this as well, as small businesses dig deep into their line of credit to finance day to day operations. Maybe the author can tell his employer he can wait 90 to 120 days for his paycheque? I would like to see how he feels about this after having to wait this long to get payment for services rendered. Reply Vince said 08/18/16 06:00am Absolute BS to make the big companies feel better. You are screwing your suppliers using antiquated means. Get your own financial house in order and stop taking it out on your supplierd Reply Deb said 08/22/16 09:51am We are a SME and a client, who is part of a rather large entity, “offered” to pay in terms that turned out to be reverse factoring. Unbeknownst to us, there is a UCC filing connected to this arrangement. Our lender objected to it and almost pulled our line of credit. Another example of a big company sticking it to the little guy. Reply Keith Hallam said 08/23/16 20:31pm It’s bullshit! Big fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite ’em. Little fleas have smaller fleas and so ad infinitum…. Just pay up and on time. Reply Spyros Lekkakos said 08/24/16 12:34pm Thank you all for your comments and for giving me the opportunity to resolve some misunderstandings. First, the article does not claim that extending payment terms to SME suppliers is something good. On the contrary, it clearly states that “when buyers associate their RF programs with terms extension, the value for their supply chain is lower than that achieved without the extension strategy” (actually, I have already published a paper that shows this: http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/IJPDLM-07-2014-0165). In other words, even if the credit spread between multinational buyers and their suppliers is large, the integrated supply chain is always better off when there is no terms extension. Then, a question that naturally follows is “why do large firms associate their RF programs with payment term extension if this is not economically efficient?” To answer this question we studied published data from some firms (among which, the Unilever) to get more insights. One of our models shows that when an –otherwise, creditworthy- firm is faced with increased cost of external financing (which may have been the case for Unilever’s long-term investments in the aftermath of the 2008 liquidity crisis), then it may hold back on its investments (thus, cause underinvestment for the entire supply chain). In this case (and only), getting funds from within the supply chain by extending payment terms may be beneficial for all parties involved. To be more specific, by taking a look at the example discussed in the article, notice that the suppliers in this example tradeoff a 60-day term extension with 25% increase in turnover during a period when the market was (and has been until very recently) stagnant. Reply Damien said 09/10/16 16:03pm Spyros, Your article, in theory, sounds real good… to the MNCs, that is! As someone from supply chain, l’d like to comment here: 1. When you push Net 60 to Net 90 or Net 120, suddenly you are no longer the Tier-1 customer for your supplier! They’ll grit their teeth and keep quiet: till they score a big league customer like Unilever (or-whoever-who-cares!). The moment that happens, you can kiss that outstanding service goodbye! Heck, they’ll do you one better: They’ll actually call you up going,”Hey you need product from us? Sure thing, but here’s how we are rolling: you either pay COD or by wire or by credit card. Anything else then please lose our number!” They have bills to pay, their suppliers to pay. So while the MNC is funding other projects using THEIR money and maximizing their profitability, you seriously expect suppliers to, what, grin and bear it because a big client has graced them with their business? I don’t think so! 2. I have an alternate proposal: how about the MNCs offer these suppliers dynamic discounting? With their cash reserves they can fund the entire operation and post tangible, quantifiable cost savings and the suppliers walk away happy too! 3. If we are having any suppliers here reading this who’s got clients mandating you to use their Ariba platform to do business with them then there’s something you should know: SAP doesn’t charge these big clients for doing business on their platform; they charge the suppliers!!! What you need to do: In your invoices, add a separate line item for the service fee that SAP would charge you and bill your customer! The way I figure, since it’s their grand idea to use Ariba, why should you be paying for the back-end charges? This is slightly out of context from the centent of this article, I know but it wouldn’t hurt to mention it here. I have nothing to lose but you guys have something to gain! 😉 Reply David Atkinson said 09/07/16 05:33am The suggestion that “efficiencies captured by Unilever were passed on to suppliers in the form of higher order volumes — in effect, a win-win.” and is therefore a blueprint for others aiming to extend payment terms is laughable, or worse, risible. This is nothing more than the abuse of commercial power (or leverage) to create a ‘win’ for the buying organisation. Anyone with an ounce of experience is getting the best value out of key supplier relationships knows that extending payment terms through coercion is counter-productive, erodes trust, and promotes cheating or guile from suppliers, who load up prices to compensate. I’m afraid to say that this is the sort of c**p procurement professionals have to deal with from some close to the CFO’s office.

CHI UK is a leading specialist software developer for the occupational health, police and security markets. The software house, which was founded in 1995 by Neil Connor, first starting developing specialist occupational health software for large industrial clients, typically with over 2,000 employees. The CHI UK team is now five strong and had been based in North Tyneside before its move to Hoults Yard. Mr Connor said: “Orchid Desktop is now one of the leading occupational health systems in the UK as well as for a number of international clients in places such as Malta and Dubai. “Unlike other more complex products in the market we have created a cloud-based OH database software that is intuitive and very easy for nurses and doctors to use. We are the only company in the market to offer free online downloads so users can trial the software first because we’re confident once they see how easy it is to use they’ll choose it.” CHI UK has seen significant growth in the sector as more and more industrial companies out-source the management of their occupational health responsibilities to firms such as BUPA and Capita, as well as having an enviable client list including names such as Procter and Gamble, L’Oréal, Dupont and McCain as well as many universities. The second area of expertise for CHI UK is the development of police and fire-arm management software. The specialist armoury management software was re-launched as CHIPS in 2013 and is now used by police authorities all over the UK as well as gun clubs, the National Rifle Association and in places from Abu Dhabi to Mexico. Mr Connor said: “CHIPS safeguards an entire armoury, including firearms, ammunitions, servicing records, and other assets. The software is a vital security and safe-guarding tool to records registrations, gun entitlement and licenses right down to where every bullet is and has been fired.” The software is secure as all data held in CHIPS is protected by powerful encryption and access to the system is only available to authorised users and by PIN authentication. The training element is also very important to the police who use it to record all aspects of officer training including the extensive NPFTC records as well as other police courses, authorisations, and physical and fitness tests – and even all aspects of dog training and handlers’ qualifications. “The software we produce is for very specialist markets and used to promote occupational health, safety and security,” said Wallsend-born Mr Connor, who started working in IT at a computer unit for the NHS. “CHIPS is considered to be the UK’s gold standard in police and security software and is the most popular suite of professional police and security applications in the UK. Over the years we have supplied most UK police forces as well as the British Transport Police, the Royal Air Force, the Ministry of Defence, the UK Atomic Energy Authority, and the United Nations’ HQ Police. “Orchid Desktop has become a market leader because it is simple and quick to use and allows the recording and planning of every aspect of an Occupational Health departments work. Our new system, OrchidLive.com, continues the development of our software onto the Web. “We are delighted with our new base at Hoults Yard and relocated to Newcastle as it was the location of choice for our employees. Our developers are vital to the success of our business and they all love the place and that’s very important for us.” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Business Newsletter Follow @EveningChron Subscribe to our Business newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On Ouseburn North Tyneside Newcastle upon Tyne business all Most Read Most Recent GatesheadStation pub in Gateshead to reopen after £350,000 makeover by Hadrian Border Brewery Hadrian Border Brewery said the Victorian pub will be the first in a new chain of independent pubs PoliticsAutumn Statement RECAP: North East reaction to Philip Hammond's first budget statement Follow live updates and reaction after Chancellor Philip Hammond made his inaugural economic statement Black FridayNearly half of shoppers turned off by Black Friday, Eldon Square owner says Shopping centre intu, which also owns the Gateshead Metrocentre, surveyed 2,000 shoppers on attitudes to the discount-fest NissanNissan to sell its stake in supplier Calsonic Kansei for £3.6bn Calsonic Kansei has four plants in Sunderland and employs more than 1,400 people in the North East JesmondRecently refurbished Jesmond pub The Brandling comes up to rent The Brandling in Jesmond has been refurbished and is already attracting a lot of interest from potential publicans North East Business AwardsFledgling firms set to shine at North East Business Awards 2017 Could your firm win the Newcomer of the Year Award?

The pungent aroma of indiscernible sweet scents wafts out the door and into the rest of the building. “Perfumery is one of the old world crafts, just like silversmithing or goldsmithing,” he said. Al Adamson in the laboratory at Creative Fragrances Photo credit: Gianni Windahl Adamson, one of only about 200 perfumers in the U.S. and executive vice president at Creative Fragrances, a perfume manufacturing company located in northeast Dallas, clearly likes his job. Adamson revealed the hidden side of the perfume industry to a Daily Campus reporter one day recently. He explained the difference between synthetic fragrances and natural fragrances and gave insight into how a fragrance perfumer is made and how fragrances are created. According to a 2015 report by NPD, a data collection company, the perfume business is a $28 billion industry globally and nearly $6 billion in the United States. Some SMU students, such as first-year Elizabeth Whitson, add fuel to the fire. “I really love perfume, I always wear it before I go out,” said Whitson. The all-natural beauty products trend has created some controversy over the use of synthetic chemicals in perfume versus natural oils, Adamson acknowledged. But there are pros and cons to both. Essential oils are more expensive, harder to come by, and occasionally more irritating to the skin than some fragrances that are produced synthetically. Natural essential oils are extracted from crop products, and they can be expensive. Rose absolute is $1,024 a pound, for instance, and sandalwood oil is $1,500 to $4,000 a pound. Essential oils are also a limited resource. “There are many essential oils right now, like chamomile Roman oil that only come from Italy or England. But they are unavailable because the whole world supply has been purchased by designer fragrance companies,” said Adamson. He added that a perfumer cannot buy Roman chamomile until the next crop comes out in August. “So there’s none available in the world until August of this year and I’m sure everyone’s going to buy it all up once it’s released,” said Adamson. Perfumers sometimes choose to face these challenges because essential oils provide the fullest fragrance. He said that synthetic oils are trying to mimic what natural oil, such as lavender oil, smells like. However, there are certain chemicals in parts per million in the natural lavender plant oil that are impossible to synthesize at a chemical plant. “The natural lavender oil tends to have a fuller more rounded odor. So synthetics tend to be a little thinner, a little weaker, sometimes smell a little chemical-ly and different from the natural plant,” said Adamson. Some SMU students, such as second-year Whitney Smith, have expressed concern over fragrance allergies. “I start sneezing when I smell some perfumes,” Smith said. But what people may not know is that some of the chemicals in natural oils can be more irritating than those made in factories. Take for example, natural lavender, which contains 35 to 40 chemical ingredients. Two of the main chemicals are linalool and linalool acetate, which are slight skin allergens. They are found in the plant naturally, and cannot be taken out because they are a main component in the scent. But linalool and linalool acetate can also be made in chemical plants, and used to create synthetic lavender oil. And when a chemist is making the synthetic version of lavender, he can adjust the level in the formula so it is not as irritating. “So from a safety standpoint, almost all of natural essential oils contain allergens. So when you make a synthetic version of some of these naturals, you can actually make it safer by limiting or reducing the amount of the allergens that are in the natural product,” said Adamson. For those with allergies, he suggests purchasing synthetic fragrance or buying unscented or lightly scented products. The science that goes into making perfume is exact, and Adamson highlighted the process of becoming a perfumer and then making perfumes. “You can’t go to SMU and get a degree in perfumery- it doesn’t exist. There are essentially no colleges that have diplomas in perfumery because it’s such a small profession,” said Adamson, who completed his apprenticeship program at Proctor & Gamble. He said that an aspiring perfumer has to apprentice under a master perfumer for five to eight years to learn the craft. In these years, the student studies all of the ingredients and memorizes their odors. This is no small feat, since there are approximately 5,000 different synthetic chemicals over 150 essential oils that can be used in fragrance. Once the student has completed his program, he joins the American Society of Perfumers. The perfumer can then set out on the task of creating a fragrance. Adamson provided an example of how he might create a lemon scent for a cleaning product. There are around 500 ingredients that can be used in a lemon scent. Adamson said he chooses the top 10 to 30 ingredients he thinks will fit. He then fills out a formula card with the percentages of those ingredients and sends it to the laboratory to be created. Once it’s made, he checks to see if it smells the way he intended, and he “costs it out” to make sure it’s inexpensive enough for the cheap cleaning product. “It’s sort of a trial and error process after that, but the original formula you have created in your mind,” Adamson said. Whether it is fragrance for a detergent, or the discerning consumer, the perfume industry will adapt. Former account coordinator for Guerlain fragrance, Patricia Arnold, said that in the 1980s fragrances were predominately synthetic, a fact that was rarely questioned by the customer. Arnold added that department stores today now offer multiple choices of 100 percent natural fragrances as well. “The modern department store has its bases covered and truly offers something for everyone,” Arnold said.

Tweet   Over 7 Toxic Chemicals Found In Laundry Detergent! Over 7 Toxic Chemicals Found In Laundry Detergent! It's time to start protecting your family and children.   EcoWasher Detergent Free Toxic Free Laundry   EcoWasher Detergent Free Toxic Free Laundry   (EMAILWIRE.COM, August 13, 2016 ) Chicago, IL - You could smell it when you stroll down the laundry aisle. In some cases it's so bad you need to cover your nose. All those perfumes. It's not simply your creativity. In 2008, researchers reported on the toxic chemicals in laundry cleaning agents and other laundry items. Annmarie Skin Care viewers were probably way ahead of them. Most of us know that with artificial fragrance come chemicals that our body doesn't take care of (to place it gently). Given that 2008, more chemicals located alike supermarket detergents have actually surfaced. As a matter of fact, we discovered 7 even more, and have actually noted them for you right here, along with some healthier alternatives. You should not have to suffer asthma or dermatitis simply to have clean garments. Researchers Discover Evidence of What We've Suspected. Initially, allow us to's consider that study. Scientists from the University of Washington researched top-selling laundry and air-freshening products and discovered that they discharged lots of various chemicals. All them released at the very least one identified as toxic or hazardous under government laws! Worse-- none of these chemicals was noted on the label. Among the items tested were an anti-static sheet, a fabric softener, and a laundry detergent, as well as spray and plug-in air fresheners. Results showed almost ONE HUNDRED volatile organic substances (VOCs) emitted from the six products, and none were on the tag. "5 of the 6 products produced several cancer causing 'hazardous air toxins,' which are thought about by the Environmental Protection Agency to have no safe direct exposure level," stated study author Anne Steinemann. That's not all. A later 2011 study by the very same researchers located that air ducted from machines utilizing top-selling scented liquid laundry detergent and aromatic anti-static sheet consisted of unsafe chemicals, consisting of 2 categorized as carcinogens. For the study, scientists ran a lots of laundry once without products, as soon as with a leading brand name of scented liquid laundry detergent, and when with both the detergent and an anti-static sheet. They recorded the exhaust from the clothes dryer vent with a canister. An evaluation of the recorded air proved to greater than 25 VOCs, consisting of 7 harmful air contaminants. The two carcinogens were acetaldehyde and benzene. " These items could affect not just individual health," stated Steinemann, "however likewise public and ecological health. The chemicals can enter into the air, down the tubes and right into water bodies.". 7 Toxic Chemicals in Laundry Detergents. Let's look much more carefully at what producers are putting into laundry cleaning agents that could not be good for our health:. Fragrance: This is among the major problems, and the emphasis of both researches above. Suppliers integrate a variety of chemicals to create a scent-- so you'll believe your clothes are clean due to the fact that they scent clean-- and they don't have to detail those chemicals on the tag as a result of trade defense. As we've seen, a few of those chemicals can be extremely toxic. Cleaning brokers (surfactants): These are consisted of in the formula in order to help the item tidy better. Examples include chemicals like quaternium-15 (known to release formaldehyde, a well-known health hazard), diethanolamine (related to skin and eye inflammation and possibly liver problems), nonlphenol ethoxylate or NPE (toxic to nerves, annoying to skin, possible hormone disruptor, toxic to water life), linear alkyl benzene sulfonates or LAS (annoying to skin and eyes and toxic to water life; benzene by itself is a carcinogen), and oil extracts (connected to cancer and lung damages). Stabilizers: These chemicals aid maintain the formula, to make sure that it lasts much longer on the shelf. Instances include polyalkylene oxide or ethylene oxide, which are linked with eye and lung irritability, or even dermatitis. Bleach: Bleach might be used independently or may be included in the detergent itself. It's recognized to aggravate skin, eyes, and lungs, and when it mixes with wastewater, it could create toxic organic compounds that have been related to breathing concerns, liver, and kidney damages. 1,4-dioxane: This is a chemical byproduct of detergent manufacturing. In independent tests, Female's Voices for the Earth found 89 parts per million (ppm) in Trend Free & Gentle and 63 ppm in regular Tide. They aided raise awareness, and Proctor & Gamble accepted reformulate to reduce ranks to listed below 25 ppm. Future examinations need to demonstrate to whether they made great on that particular assurance. Brighteners: You'll find these in detergents marketing their "lightening up" powers. Brighter whites! Brighter colors! Exactly what's producing all this illumination? Chemicals that really continue to be on the garments to take in UV light and assist clothes "appear" brighter. We're speaking things like naphthotriazolystilbenes (linked with developmental and reproductive effects), benzoxazolyl, diaminostilbene disulfonate, and much more. Because these remain on the garments, they are most likely ahead right into contact with skin. Phosphates & EDTA: Makers make use of these making detergents much more reliable in tough water, and to help avoid dust from kicking back on garments when they're washing. These chemicals have long been associated with ecological damage, specifically in our streams and waterways. They trigger algae blossoms that harm ecological communities. Many cleaning agents have actually gotten rid of these, yet they're frequently making use of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) in its location, which does not readily biodegrade, and has actually been discovered to be toxic in pet educations. All-natural Alternatives. We do not need to subject ourselves and our families to all these chemicals for tidy garments. There is an option both for the residence customer, and the professional user such as healthcare facilities, laundry mats and hotels. The remedy to a toxic free, chemical free, money conserving laundry has actually been utilized by health centers for several years. Ot is called an ozone laundry system. Instead of using damaging, and hazardous laundry detergents the washing washing are converted to an oxygen, ozone detergent free laundry system. The solution now available for both the home and industrial setup is called EcoWasher detergent Free laundry washing system. Benefits of EcoWasher Laundry Utilizing Ozone rather than toxic laundry detergent:. Ozone laundry is a kind of textile treatment that utilizes oxygen and power in a special means. It is taken into consideration as eco clean laundry because ozone replaces many of the chemicals usually made use of in a conventional washing technique.

Today, even though the political scene appears fractured, and worldwide terror seems to be on the rise, the markets hit all-time highs. The question for investors is what to do now. The answer is buy some of the top dividend stocks, put them in your account and hold them forever. We screened the Merrill Lynch research universe for stock on the dividend aristocrats lists that were also rated Buy. The dividend aristocrats are members of the S&P 500 and have increased their dividends for at least 20 consecutive years. We found four that investors can buy now and hold forever. AT&T This company has had an incredible run this year, and the Merrill Lynch team sees it going even higher. AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) is the world’s largest provider of pay TV, with TV customers in the United States and 11 Latin American countries. In the United States, the AT&T wireless network has the nation’s self-described strongest 4G LTE signal and most reliable 4G LTE. The company also helps businesses worldwide serve their customers better with mobility and highly secure cloud solutions. With its shares trading at a very cheap 14.3 times estimated 2016 earnings, the company continues to expand its user base, and strong product introductions from smartphone vendors have not only driven traffic but increased device financing plans. The company reported inline numbers for the second quarter, and while the consolidated revenue number was slightly higher than the Merrill Lynch estimate, the EBITDA was slightly below. Company management noted it is on track to meet or exceed current estimates for the year. Many Wall Street analysts have cited the company’s positive commentary on free cash flow, in addition to improving video/broadband trends later this year, with single truck-roll and new converged offerings expected to be coming in October. AT&T investors are paid a huge 4.42% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $46, and the Wall Street consensus target is $42.84. The stock closed Thursday at $43.39 per share. Coca-Cola This company remains a top Warren Buffet holding and offers not only safety, but an incredible strong worldwide brand. Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) is the world’s largest beverage company, refreshing consumers with more than 500 sparkling and still brands. Led by Coca-Cola, its portfolio features 20 billion-dollar brands, including Diet Coke, Fanta, Sprite, Coca-Cola Zero, vitaminwater, Powerade and Minute Maid. Globally, it is the top provider of sparkling beverages, ready-to-drink coffees and juices and juice drinks. Through the world’s largest beverage distribution system, consumers in more than 200 countries enjoy its beverages at a rate of more than 1.9 billion servings a day. Despite reporting second-quarter earnings that came in above some estimates, slower growth and flat volumes brought out the sellers and they tagged the stock big time. It is important to remember though that the company own 31.5% of Monster Beverage, which continues to deliver big numbers. Coca-Cola investors receive an outstanding 3.2% dividend. The Merrill Lynch price target is set at $52, while the consensus price target figure is $47.76. The stock closed Thursday at $43.75. 3M This top industrial could really jump with an economic pickup. 3M Co. (NYSE: MMM) is a diversified, global manufacturer. Its businesses are technology-driven and organized under five segments: Consumer, Safety and Graphics, Electronics and Energy, Healthcare, and Industrial. Its popular brands include Scotch, Post-It, 3M and Thinsulate. The company also holds over 500 U.S. patents. 3M posted outstanding second-quarter results, and the company adjusted the midpoint of its guidance, the analysts remain positive but note the company, like many, faces a tough global macro environment. They do think the results are strong in relation to peers and feel that the focus toward return on invested capital will yield multiple expansion and earnings growth. 3M investors are paid a decent 2.45% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $200 price target for the stock, and the Wall Street consensus price objective is $179.43. Shares closed most recently at $181. Procter & Gamble This stock is trading at almost the same level it was this time last year, in part because it has a very large 65% of sales directed to foreign customers, which should improve as the dollar’s run has slowed dramatically. Procter & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) is a solid consumer staples stock for conservative investors to consider. The company sells lots of very well-known household items that are essential for everyday life, and it operates through five segments: Beauty, Hair and Personal Care; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby, Feminine and Family Care. The company posted solid earnings last quarter, and many on Wall Street feel that the new focus on a slimmed down product portfolio will help spur earnings growth and return the company to its long-time premium consumer staples multiple. Some analyst estimates for the next two years are 2% above current Wall Street expectations. Shareholders are paid a solid 3.1% dividend. Merrill Lynch has a $95 price target, and the posted consensus estimate is a touch lower at $90.56. The stock closed Thursday at $86.73 a share.

It’s one of the most universal recommendations in all of public health: Floss daily to prevent gum disease and cavities. A recent AP report cited little proof that flossing works. When the federal government issued its 2016 dietary guidelines, the flossing recommendation had been removed, without notice. SHAVAUGHN MOSS Guardian Lifestyles Editor shavaughn@nasguard.com Published: Aug 09, 2016 Share This: Rate this article: Add To favourite “Medical benefits of dental floss unproven” — it was a headline that caught many people’s attention last week — after all, one of the most universal recommendations in public health is to floss daily to prevent gum disease and cavities. A report by the Associated Press (AP) cited little proof that flossing works despite the fact that the United States federal government, dental organizations and manufacturers of floss have pushed the practice for decades; and the American Dental Association (ADA) insists that “flossing is an essential part of taking care of teeth and gums”. The AP requested evidence on the U.S. government’s findings on flossing from the United States (U.S.) Departments of Health and Human Services and Agriculture, and followed up with written requests under the Freedom of Information Act. When the federal government issued its latest dietary guidelines this year, the flossing recommendation had been removed, without notice. In a letter to the AP, the government acknowledged the effectiveness of flossing had never been researched, as required. The AP report said it looked at the most rigorous research conducted over the past decade, focusing on 25 studies that generally compared the use of a toothbrush with the combination of toothbrushes and floss. The findings? The evidence for flossing was “weak, very unreliable,” of “very low” quality, and carries “a moderate to large potential for bias.” And that the majority of available studies fail to demonstrate that flossing is generally effective in plaque removal, according to one review conducted last year. Another 2015 review cited “inconsistent/weak evidence” for flossing and a "lack of efficacy.” The AP report said one study review in 2011 did credit floss with a slight reduction in gum inflammation — which can sometimes develop over time into full-fledged gum disease. However, the reviewers ranked the evidence as “very unreliable”. And that commentary in a dental magazine stated that any benefit would be so minute it might not be noticed by users. Local periodontist Dr. Antoine Clarke encourages flossing as one part of a regular hygiene routine that also includes brushing teeth at least twice a day and flossing at least once a day, as the main purpose of flossing is to decrease plaque (bacteria). “The long-term benefit number one is it [flossing] decreases plaque that builds up around teeth. Plaque induces inflammation that leads to gingival inflammation, swelling and can also cause tooth decay,” said Dr. Clarke who practices out of Rose North House on Collins Avenue “I’ve been practicing for over 20 years and I’ve seen the benefits with [people who floss] and those that don’t — those that come in with regular oral hygiene habits — that use toothbrushes, interdental cleaners and go for regular checkups, and those that don’t, so it [report] really didn’t bother me much,” he said. “Patients need to always floss at least a minimum of once a day. There is always a tight spot or spots in every individual that need urgent care, and if we leave food particles, plaque, between the teeth or around the gum, you develop either dental caries [cavities], or periodontal disease. It minimizes those two diseases right there.” The U.S. federal government has recommended flossing since 1979, first in a surgeon general’s report and later in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans issued every five years. According to the AP report, two leading professional groups — the American Dental Association and the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP), for specialists in gum disease and implants — cited other studies as proof of their claims that flossing prevents buildup of gunk known as plaque, early gum inflammation called gingivitis and tooth decay. But, the AP said, most of these studies used outdated methods or tested few people. The report said some lasted only two weeks – far too brief for a cavity or dental disease to develop. And that one tested 25 people after only a single use of floss. Such research, like the reviewed studies, focused on warning signs like bleeding and inflammation, barely dealing with gum disease or cavities. The AP report also said Wayne Aldredge, president of the periodontists’ group, acknowledged the weak scientific evidence and the brief duration of many studies. In an interview at his private practice in New Jersey, he said that the impact of floss might be clearer if researchers focused on patients at the highest risk of gum disease, such as diabetics and smokers. He still urges his patients to floss to help avoid gum disease. “It’s like building a house and not painting two sides of it,” said Aldredge. “Ultimately those two sides are going to rot away quicker.” When the story made headlines, Dr. Clarke said patients flooded his office with questions and to find out his position. He is a flossing advocate. “The main purpose of flossing is to remove plaque [bacteria]. Some individuals don’t have the manual dexterity to get between the teeth. Some individuals over the years may have had numerous restorations — amalgams, filling, composites, crowns, veneers, bridges — all these things floss needs to be able to clean. In the absence of floss, those individuals would develop dental decay, which is on the rise. Also what we consider recurrent decay, which is also at a higher increase.” The periodontist said periodontal disease is influenced and takes place over a period of time, and also influenced by multiple factors. He said the AAP recommends that studies need to be more detailed as relates to the efficacy of daily flossing. He also said many people floss incorrectly, moving it in a sawing motion instead of up and down the sides of the teeth. According to Dr. Clarke, the wrong way to floss is tying the floss between your fingers and not having control. He said the other wrong way to floss entails using it like a saw between the teeth. The right way, he said, is to roll off at least 10 inches of floss, wrap it around the two index fingers so that you can control it, wrap the floss around the tooth and proceed in an up and down motion. Dr. Clarke said in the absence of quality research, patients should continue to include flossing as part of their daily oral hygiene habits. “Flossing from the early 60s has been one of the main adjuncts in keeping bacteria and oral diseases under control, and is probably one of the least expensive mains in maintenance therapy — $3 for a box of floss or $600 to $2,000 for a yearly visit to the dentist,” said Dr. Clarke. Aldredge, pressed by the AP about the origins of his organization’s endorsement of flossing, said it may simply have “taken the ADA’s lead”. When the ADA was asked for proof of its claim that flossing helps prevent early gum disease and cavities by the AP, the group cited the 2011 review and a 2008 two-week study that measured bacteria and did not even consider gum disease. In a later statement to the AP the ADA said flossing “removes plaque” and “is proven to help remove” debris from between teeth. A video on its website proclaims that flossing “helps prevent gum disease”. When pressed, Matthew J. Messina, a practicing dentist and spokesman for the dental association, acknowledged weak evidence, but he blamed research participants who didn't floss correctly. The AAP also recommends flossing as one part of a regular hygiene routine that also includes brushing your teeth at least twice a day, and flossing at least once a day. The AAP in association with the ADA, recommends that patients need to floss in conjunction with other home care products. “Regular dental oral hygiene and care is based on a number of things — not just flossing,” said Dr. Clarke. “Flossing alone does not show any strong scientific evidence to prevent any of those things. Basically that study was geared towards people only flossing and not brushing. But a part of the study that was missing was they didn’t compare individuals that used a toothbrush regularly, and also those individuals that use toothbrushing as well as flossing. Flossing is one of a few dental cleaners that helps in dental hygiene,” he said. “The AAP shows that the interdental cleaners is an essential part of periodontal care and maintenance, and that includes floss, small brushes, special wooden or plastic picks, sticks or water flossers — all of these are adjuncts to help.” According to the AP report, even companies with a big market share of the flossing business which next year is predicted to reach almost $2 billion, struggled to provide convincing evidence of their claims that floss reduces plaque or gingivitis, and that the industry had paid for most studies and sometimes designed and conducted the research. The report said Procter & Gamble, which claims that its floss fights plaque and gingivitis, pointed to a two-week study, which was discounted as irrelevant in the 2011 research review. And that Johnson & Johnson spokesman Marc Boston said floss helps remove plaque and that when the AP sent him a list of contradicting studies, he declined comment. The floss-making companies partner with the ADA through its Seal of Acceptance program. The ADA promotes the seal to companies as something that “directly affects the purchase decisions of consumers”; each manufacturer is charged $14,500 for the evaluation. If it approves the product, the ADA then charges an additional annual fee of $3,500. The ADA says it rigorously evaluates products and makes no profit from the program. However, floss companies themselves are allowed to design the studies. "The funding can come from companies — no problem at all,” said dentist Marcelo W.B. Araujo, vice president of the ADA’s Science Institute, who joined the organization after serving as an executive for Johnson & Johnson. “The design can start from the company.” When flossing first gained acceptance, no proof was required of remedies. Dentist Levi Spear Parmly is credited with inventing floss in the early 19th century. By the time the first floss patent was issued, in 1874, the applicant noted that dentists were widely recommending its use. The ADA has been promoting floss universally since 1908. “They just looked into what they did every day in their clinical practice and what they would recommend for patients,” said Araujo. Dentist Damien Walmsley, scientific adviser to the British Dental Association, can be counted among the skeptics, according to the AP report. “It’s important to tell people to do the basics. Flossing is not part of the basics.” The AP report said floss can occasionally cause harm, as careless flossing can damage gums, teeth and dental work. Though frequency is unclear, it said floss can dislodge bad bacteria that invade the bloodstream and cause dangerous infections, especially in people with weak immunity, according to the medical literature. National Institutes of Health dentist Tim Iafolla acknowledged that if the highest standards of science were applied in keeping with the flossing reviews of the past decade, “then it would be appropriate to drop the floss guidelines”. Regardless, he added, people should still floss. “It’s low risk, low cost,” he said. “We know there’s a possibility that it works, so we feel comfortable telling people to go ahead and do it.”   Add comment Comments Name:  Email:  Submit Note: Comments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.

The robot was seen in action this week at the b8ta store in Palo Alto, California, a gadget shop launched by former Nest employees. Pepper was on a demo loop at the store, so we weren’t able to fully interact with it. But the idea behind Pepper is that it’s supposed to interpret and respond to a variety of customer needs. Using a combination of 2D and 3D cameras in its eyes and mouth, plus four multi-directional microphones, Pepper is able to "read" four human emotions — happiness, joy, sadness, and anger — and respond accordingly. It rolls up to you, raises its hands in greeting when you introduce yourself, and turns its head toward you when you move or talk. It is toylike and adorable. What’s more interesting than Pepper’s supposed emotional quotient is its potential to know exactly what you’re doing in a store. Right now, more than 10,000 of these robots have been deployed across Japan or are in pilot trials in Europe, and the vast majority are being used in retail and hospitality businesses. A Pepper robot might know when you’ve entered a store, how much time you’ve spent there, how many products you interact with, or whether you seem happy or angry when you pick up a product. It will tell you, "That camera is 20 percent off," in its innocent-kid-voice, its big eyes blinking at you, and make you think about buying that camera. Pepper might tell you, "That camera is 20 percent off," its big eyes blinking at you, and make you think about buying that camera "When I was at P&G I didn’t know how many people walked into Walmart and saw our brands," Steve Carlin, Softbank Robotic’s vice president of marketing and business development, said in an interview with The Verge. "Now, I can." Of course, many retail stores already use cameras, sensors, and other technology to gain insights on customer intent, interactions, and purchases. But Pepper is an attempt to put a friendly face on sophisticated tracking technology that some consumers might even consider… invasive. "The key word is empathy," Carlin said. "Cameras and screens are very passive. Pepper creates empathy." He acknowledged that Pepper could face the same "issues" that any technology does when it comes to consumer concerns about privacy, but ultimately, it all depends on how the end user — in this case, the merchant or business paying for Pepper’s services — uses information. As my Verge colleague Sam Byford pointed out during his recent encounter with Pepper in Japan, there’s still little evidence of its true emotion-detecting capabilities at this stage. But it may get there someday, especially as developers begin to create apps that run on NAOqi, its proprietary OS. Pepper won’t be a permanent fixture in Silicon Valley; it’s just there for a week to let people know that it’s in the US, and to get app developers excited about it. Softbank Robotics executives say the robots will find their way into other US retail stores "before the end of the year." Merchants and other business owners will pay several hundred dollars a week for Pepper and its services, all of which is sold as a three-year subscription. But Softbank is betting its emotional robot will easily pay for itself.

Hot Topics: School Calendar Set 'Rumors' at LHS Kirk Cameron Event Fat Shack Opens Turkey Trot Remembring Hughes Stadium Premature Babies RH Line Police Calls Walmarts Loveland distribution center, which opened 20 years ago, remains major employer in the area By Shelley Widhalm,Loveland Reporter-Herald Posted:   12/18/2010 06:20:04 PM MST When the Walmart Distribution Center opened in Loveland 20 years ago, the 1 million-plus-square-foot facility was easily visible from I-25. Thats not the case anymore with The Ranch and several other businesses in the area of 1550 E. Crossroads Blvd. When we opened, it was us and a church and another business, said Loveland resident Bobbie Moyer, who has worked at the distribution center since it opened. Now, its hard to find us. The distribution center is one of two in Colorado and 147 nationwide. The state has 59 Supercenters, including two in Loveland, and nine discount stores, as well as 15 Sams Clubs. Moyer started and remained in the position of data processing systems operator, staying with the company because she liked the benefits and the companys stability, she said. Walmart trains you from the minute you walk in the door. You dont have to have any prior experience, Moyer said. Laura Bahlmann, also of Loveland, has been with the distribution center since its opening and, like Moyer, remained in the same position, that of distribution receiving. She works on the receiving dock, unloading, processing and labeling the freight that comes into the building. Ive always known where I stood with Walmart, Bahlmann said, adding that she likes the work she does. Its a nice stable job. ... Its nice to wake up in the morning knowing that a job is stable and there for you. Bahlmann and Moyer are among the more than 1,000 associates who work at Walmart Distribution Center 6019. Advertisement The center started with 350 associates, of which 65 still remain with the company. Why Loveland? Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which was founded in 1962, chose Loveland for the distribution center at a time when the company had no distribution centers and few stores in the western United States, said Dan Speed, general manager of the Loveland distribution center. The city stood out for its welcoming business environment and sense of community, along with its access to north-south and east-west highways for moving freight, Speed said. On its first day of business, Tuesday, Sept. 11, 1990, the Loveland distribution center shipped out 50,000 cases of products, Speed said, explaining that cases range from the size of a shoe box up to the size of a big-screen television set, he said. Today, the distribution center ships out an average of 150,000 cases a day, 24 hours a day, except for Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years Day. The Distribution Process Each day, the center receives truckloads of cases at the loading dock from vendors such as Tide and Proctor and Gamble. Employees scan the bar codes on the cases, 60 percent of which will be immediately shipped to the 85 stores the center serves, or shipped out the next day. The remaining 40 percent of the cases are put into inventory. The cases, which are labeled with where they are headed, are moved through the center by conveyer belt, which, if stretched out, would extend nine miles, Speed said. The cases that are shipped out fill orders the center received the night before to ensure there are no empty shelves in the Supercenters and discount centers that the distribution center serves. The Loveland center covers the general merchandise side of stores in most of Colorado and Montana, all of Wyoming and a few in Nebraska and South Dakota. It really is a competitive advantage for the company, said Dan Fogleman, spokesman for Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville, Ark. Part of the role of distribution centers is to get products to customers. We dont want merchandise in the warehouse. The distribution center conducts three operations, that of receiving and order filling, followed by shipping. Employees load the labeled products onto trucks to deliver to 21 or 22 stores at a time. The stores are organized into a batch, so that there are four batches of deliveries a day. The majority of products are in the boxes theyre received in. Some are broken down from the case, Speed said. There are certain products a store wouldnt sell a whole case of. Never Had a Layoff The distribution center has never had a layoff since it opened, has low turnover and has not had to run a help-wanted ad in more than five years, Speed said. Sixty to seventy percent of the management team came from the ranks of hourly associates, Fogleman said.

For Facebook to achieve the deepest, darkest dreams of Mark Zuckerberg, the company must become the first one that dominates both the kind of precision ads that built Google and the emotional ads that made TV the world's dominant marketing force. Facebook has so far cracked the first half of that equation, following in the footsteps of Google by locking down what's called "direct response" advertising. If I own a store in Brooklyn that sells running shoes, I naturally want to find people who are in the market for what I'm selling. If someone types "running shoes Brooklyn" into Google, the company has a pretty good clue that is a person I want. My store can pay to show a link to my website to this probable Brooklyn runner. Largely because Google became an efficient way for many businesses to find people who are looking for exactly what the businesses are selling, direct response ads make up the majority of online advertising. Facebook is pretty good at this type of advertising, too, again because we tell Facebook who we are and what we like. But dominating direct response ads with Google isn't enough for Facebook. About $200 billion is is spent each year on TV commercials, mostly on direct response's handsome brother, branded advertising. Brand ads are those TV commercials of a smiling couple driving an Audi through a snowy mountain range. The next time we go car shopping, Audi wants us to have this innate feeling that its vehicles will make us happy and beautiful. Away from the internet, brand ads make up a majority of advertising. And they're lucrative. The average cost to reach 1,000 people with a prime time TV ad was $50 in 2015, according to a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis. The comparable ad price on Facebook was $5. Facebook wants these pricey brand ads desperately. Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg is fond of saying that for advertisers and their $500 billion budgets, the social network is like the Super Bowl every night. She's wrong. Facebook is way bigger than the Super Bowl. More than 1.1 billion people use Facebook daily. About 110 million people watch the Super Bowl telecast. Sandberg's pitch is about convincing advertisers to think of Facebook as a place that is even bigger than TV's biggest stage but with the stockpile of personal information to target ads only to people who are most likely to buy an Audi. In Facebook's view, it is the best of Google's bloodlessly efficient direct response advertising with the mass reach and charm of TV commercials. It sounds beautiful, but it turns out it can be hard to be both Google and television. The world's biggest advertiser, Procter & Gamble, told the Wall Street Journal that it found targeting niches like teenage shavers on Facebook generated too narrow an audience for P&G brands that need to sells millions of bottles of Tide and Gillette razors. This seems, I don't know, blindingly obvious? P&G said it won't spend less money on Facebook, but it and some other big advertisers seem to be falling back in love with TV. The top 100 marketers spent 1 percent more on TV ads in the first quarter of this year compared with the amount in the period a year earlier, according to a Morgan Stanley analysis published in May. That was a lift from a 2 percent decline in their combined TV ad spending last year. P&G was among a handful of top brand advertisers -- also including GM, Pepsi and Verizon -- that sharply increased their TV ad spending this year after pulling back in 2015. "Investors should feel better about TV's place in ad budgets today than they did a year ago," Morgan Stanley wrote. What's good for TV is probably not good for Facebook's ambitions in brand advertising. Still, the winds are at Facebook's back. Younger people in particular are spending more free time on their phones, including on Facebook, and less on TV. Facebook is expanding the pool of potential advertisers to small businesses that never advertised beyond the Yellow Pages. Facebook's commitment to online video -- which looks a lot like TV -- helps it lure brand ads, too. It won't be easy for Facebook, but the company knows it won't crack the next 95 percent of that advertising spending unless it figures out how to become the perfect advertising medium for companies hunting for the best blend of TV and the web.

According to the report, the global fatty alcohols market was valued at US$3.52 bn in 2014 and is anticipated to reach US$5.48 bn in 2023, expanding at a CAGR of 5.1% between 2015 and 2023. Fatty alcohols are aliphatic alcohols that are predominantly linear and monohydric. These can be saturated or have one or more double bonds. Based on the raw materials used, fatty alcohols are chiefly classified as synthetic or natural. Synthetic fatty alcohols are produced from petrochemicals such as olefins and paraffin, while natural fatty alcohols are based on renewable resources such as fats, oils, and waxes of plant or animal origin. Based on carbon chain length, fatty alcohols can be broadly classified into C6-C10, C11-C14, C15-C22 and other fatty alcohols. Fatty alcohols are primarily employed for applications such as detergents and soaps, personal care and cosmetics, plasticizers, flavors and fragrances, and metal working fluids. Growth in personal care products, and detergents & soaps industries is primarily estimated to drive the global fatty alcohols market in the next few years. However, volatility in prices of raw materials and overproduction of fatty alcohols are projected to hamper market growth during the forecast period. Growing sales of cosmetics and beauty products in BRIC countries is anticipated to offer growth opportunities to the fatty alcohols market from 2015 to 2023.

SEVEN reasons why the Olympic gymnast is an absolute superstar Nicole Vassell 12:21 pm - 12/08/16 0shares 0shares The US gymnast has just scooped ANOTHER gold medal at Rio 2016 TAGS: Olympics One of the best things about the Olympics is that every time it comes around, there is always a new talent that the world obsesses over. In the past, the games have led to hysteria over the likes of Tom Daley, Mo Farah and of course, Jamaica’s Usain Bolt. And in Rio 2016, the breakout star is undoubtedly US gymnast Simone Biles. Competing for the very first time, she’s already won two gold medals in the first week – and folks, she’s only 19! More: Tom Daley’s fiancé makes the sweetest dedication to him after Olympic success Regardless of the country with which your loyalties lie, it’s impossible to deny that Simone has completely wiped her competition – she won Thursday’s (11th August) all-around gymnastics competition more than two points ahead of her competition! The world is in love with her right now – and here are a few reasons why… 1. She’s the most decorated athlete of the moment, having won TEN World Championship awards since 2013 She just scooped the all-around prize in Rio after completing an amazing floor routine – but she’d also impressed with the same skills at the P&G Gymnastics Championships a couple of months before. Watch, and be amazed: 2. Her skills are so defined that she has her own move: The Biles! It’s “a double layout with a half-twist and a blind landing” – but if you can’t imagine it, it looks a little something like this: *fangirling* 3. Rumour has it, she might ACTUALLY be able to fly… 🚨 The best part of Simone Biles' routine. 🚨https://t.co/WTpK7D5zQG — Cycle (@bycycle) August 11, 2016 4.

And if that weren’t enough, she handles the vault like an absolute goddess: What. A.. Performance.

She’s able to clear leaps that are longer than her own height – amazing! Simone Biles (USA) competes on the beam during the women’s individual all-around final in the Rio 2016 Summer Olympic Games 7. And along with the adoration of the Olympic viewers, she has a big fan in the form of Zac Efron. @Simone_Biles Congrats Simone! Can't wait to watch tonight.🤘🏼😉🏅#proud #hero #Rio2016 — Zac Efron (@ZacEfron) August 12, 2016 Too. Cute. Simone Biles, you’re an inspiration!
