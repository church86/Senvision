George Budwell (TMFGBudwell) Oct 17, 2016 at 7:07AM Image source: Getty Images. Buying stocks for your grandchildren can be a great way to ensure their financial future. However, it's not always easy picking stocks that are worthy of holding for exceedingly long periods of time. To help with this endeavor, our Foolish contributors offer up three stock picks below that appear to have the elements necessary to generate substantial returns over the long haul. Read on to find out which stocks they recommend, and why.  This "boring" brand should provide exciting long-term returns Jamal Carnette: I'm going to go against conventional wisdom by selecting Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG). Most financial professionals recommend higher-risk, high-expected-return investments due to the long-term holding period, or advise buying a stock your grandchild knows and loves. Needless to say, Procter & Gamble likely doesn't fit either of these criteria. The most foreseeable risk for multigenerational investments is company-specific: the company going out of business due to lack of demand for its products. It's a safe assumption this will not occur with Procter & Gamble's Pampers, Bounty, Crest, Gillette, Head and Shoulders, and Tide brands. The current hot technology stock or clothing brand may not be relevant for long, but it's a safe bet that in 50 years consumers will still need to clean up spills, brush their teeth, shave, shower, and wash their clothes. Don't confuse boring products with boring returns: P&G stock has been on fire over the last year with a 26% one-year total return versus the S&P 500's increase of 10%. Over the last 15 years, P&G has averaged a return of 8% per year versus the S&P's gain of 7%. A large part of P&G's gains comes from the company's dividend, which currently yields 3%. Over the last 50 years, Procter & Gamble has grown that dividend at a rate of 9% per year. Putting Procter & Gamble stock in a dividend-reinvestment plan makes sense for long-term investors. Finally, there's a persistent belief among financial professionals that investments must excite young people in order to encourage them to invest. I think there's a possibility this approach might be teaching the youth wrong investing lessons. You should invest in a company because it has a favorable risk-return profile, not because you're currently enamored with a company's product. The consumer goods giant may not be exciting, but it's likely your grandchildren will use P&G products for the rest of their lives, so why not invest in the company? A smart, futuristic company for your grandchildren  Neha Chamaria: When you're considering stocks for a time frame as long as one that could benefit your grandchildren, you'd ideally look for a well-established global company with an unparalleled brand reputation, a wide moat, a track record of high returns, and promising growth prospects backed by products that can address the world's upcoming needs and challenges. Industrial stalwart General Electric (NYSE:GE) is one company that has it all. Image source: General Electric. Having freed itself of its volatile financial arm, GE Capital, the General Electric of today is stronger and leaner than ever. Through its seven core industrial business segments, GE gives you exposure to nearly every key industry, including healthcare, technology, aviation, oil and gas, transportation, manufacturing, automotive, and power. There are many diversified companies out there, but it's hard to find one that has gained a solid footprint in each of its business segments. While GE is now greatly exposed to cyclical industries, diversification should mitigate risks and keep the company sailing even during tough times. More important, GE is tapping aggressively into revolutionary future tech trends like the Internet of Things (IoT), big data, and 3D printing. With your grandkids likely to be living in a world dominated by these trends, GE is one of the best bets that you could make today. In fact, GE truly is a "digital industrial company," as it calls itself. I believe a visionary management, innovative leadership, and opportunistic strategies are among GE's top strengths that should propel it to new heights in the decades to come. As GE grows, so should the returns on your investment for your grandkids.  Pharma is always a good long-term buy-and-hold George Budwell: With the average age across the globe continuing to rise, healthcare companies in general, and pharma companies in particular, should remain some of the most profitable businesses in the world for a long time to come. In this regard, top biopharmaceutical companies like Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) come off as great stocks to buy for your grandkids. Gilead Sciences is a particularly intriguing name to buy right now for two reasons. First, this top biotech is trading at a steep discount relative to its earnings potential, with a rock-bottom forward price-to-earnings ratio of 6.3. Although it is true that Gilead's core hepatitis C franchise is facing a number of significant competitive and political threats, the company still has plenty of time and resources to stave off a big hit to its top line within the next few years. Unfortunately, the market has grown increasingly impatient with management's rather careful approach on the mergers and acquisitions front, but that doesn't mean Gilead's top line is destined to crash next year, or even in 2018.  Second, the biotech does have a fairly robust and diverse clinical pipeline that's apparently being completely ignored by the market from a valuation standpoint at the moment. Nevertheless, Gilead's plethora of exciting clinical candidates, such as the anti-inflammatory drug filgotinib and its variety of anticancer drug candidates, could generate billion in sales for the company in the not-so-distant future. All told, Gilead probably won't be a top-performing stock in the short term, but its strong track record of bringing game-changing new medications to market makes it worth buying as a long-term value play.

This research report titled 'Global Face Oils Market 2016-2020' provides an in-depth analysis of the market in terms of revenue and emerging market trends. This market research report also includes up to date analysis and forecasts for various market segments and all geographical regions. The growing preference for online retail format will act as a primary driving force in market growth over the coming years. Factors such as increasing internet penetration, growing use of smartphones, and changing buying patterns of consumers have propelled such inclinations towards online retail. With the massive growth in the B2C e-commerce market across the globe, manufacturers are extending their online presence in several beautysegments. Also, customers opt for this distribution channel as it is convenient, time-saving, and offers product reviews and feedbacks. Some of the key pure-play e-retailers that offer face oils include Amazon,Alibaba, JD.com, and Rakuten Brijesh Kumar Choubey, an industry expert at Technavio for research on cosmetics and toiletry, says, "Vendors in the market are shifting towards the use of social media tools, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube, to increase awareness and promote their products. The increasing consumer engagement in social networking and blogs have prompted players to come out with some successful social media campaigns for several facial care products. For instance, P&G's 'Your Best Beautiful' for Olay, L'Oréal's 'Rock Your Style' for Garnier and Shiseido's 'Beauty vs. the World' for SHISEIDO are some of the most effective marketing campaigns Request a sample report: http://www.technavio.com/request-a-sample?report=53762 Technavio's sample reports are free of charge and contain multiple sections of the report including the market size and forecast, drivers, challenges, trends, and more. Based on product category, the report categorizes the global face oils market into the following segments: Anti-aging beauty oils Facial cleansing oils Face moisturizing oils Pre-shave oils Global face oils market by product category 2015 (%) Anti-aging beauty oils 38.01% Facial cleansing oils 25.13% Face moisturizing oils 22.34% Pre-shave oils 14.52% Source: Technavio Global anti-aging beauty oils market The anti-aging beauty oils segment is the fastest-growing category among the face oil products and is predominantly driven by the increasing demand among the aging population across the globe. The population group of around 60 years and above is one of the key customer segments for anti-aging oils. Anti-aging beauty oil products provide benefits like enriching the renewal of the skin's outer layer. Some of the popular anti-aging beauty oils brands include P&G's SK-II Facial Treatment Cleansing Oil, Estée Lauder's Resilience Lift Restorative Radiance Oil, and LVMH's Guerlain Abeille Royale Face Treatment Oil. Vendors in this product segment are coming up with several strategic initiatives to launch new product lines of face oils with anti-aging benefits to cater to the growing requirements from consumers. One of the latest developments in this segment is the advent of anti-aging beauty oil products made with natural and organic ingredients such as argan oil, marula oil, and safflower oil enriched with vitamin E. Some such natural anti-aging beauty oils are ProGenius Omega Treatment Rescue Oil from NUDE Skincare and The Body Shop Oils of Life Intensely Revitalising Facial Oil from L'Oréal. Global facial cleansing oils market The introduction of new products and the growing application of facial cleansing oils in salons and spas are anticipated to drive considerable adoption of cleansing oils over the next four years. Recently, ULTA Beauty has launched hydrating cleansing oil, which specializes in removing impurities on the skin. Manufacturers in the market are also launching several facial cleansing oils with additional properties such as sunscreens with SPF. For instance, Shiseido's Ultimate Cleansing Oil, is made using a purifying formula that eliminates long-wearing foundation, is water-resistant, and has high-SPF sunscreens. With the growing inclination towards facial cleansing oils with natural ingredients, the segment will register a CAGR of more than 3% by 2020. The French manufacturer, L'Occitane's Shea Cleansing Oil is manufactured using shea butter and sunflower seed oil and has gained massive popularity among consumers. Global face moisturizing oils market Some of the popular face moisturizing oils available in the market are Estée Lauder Nutritious Radiant Vitality Essence Oil and CLINIQUE Take the Day Off Cleansing Oil from Estée Lauder. Manufacturers in the market are coming up with face moisturizing oils that are effective for multi-skin problems like dark spots, dryness, dullness, and uneven skin tone and texture. CLINIQUE Turnaround Revitalizing Treatment Oil from Estée Lauder and L'Occitane Immortelle Divine Youth Oil from L'Occitane are some of the most popular multi-purpose face moisturizing oils. "Though the face oil moisturizers provide moisture and refreshment to reduce the extra dryness of the face, the relative high price of these products have slowed their adoption rate in the market. However, with the growing demand for natural face moisturizing oils, this segment will also witness significant growth over the predicted period. Some of the natural face moisturizing oils are Vitamin E Facial Oil and Tea Tree Oil by The Body Shop from L'Oréal. This Vitamin E Facial Oil offers an aromatic, pre-moisturizer treatment for the skin to enhance moisturization," says Brijesh. Global pre-shave oils market The global pre-shave oils market is expected to grow at a steady pace during the forecast period due to the growing demand among men for shaving oils in the developed markets such as the UK, the US, Australia, and Canada. Vendors in the market are promoting their products to drive sales coupled with new product launches. For instance, in October 2015, Dreadnought, a UK based manufacturer specialized into men's grooming, introduced new portfolio of barbershop quality beard oils such as Dreadnought Classic Blend Beard Oil and Dreadnought Cuban Blend Beard Oil. This segment is the second-fastest growing category among face oil products. Some of the popular pre-shave oils are L'Occitane's Cade Shaving Oil and L'Oreal's Viktor Rolf Spicebomb Nourishing Pre-shave Oil. Some of the premium beauty manufacturers are launching natural pre-shave oils through their flagship brands such as LVMH under its flagship brand The Art of Shaving include Pre-Shave Oil Sandalwood and Pre-Shave Oil - Lavender. The top vendors highlighted by Technavio's research analysts in this report are: Beiersdorf Estée Lauder L'Oréal P&G Shiseido Browse Related Reports: Global Facial Serum Market 2016-2020 Skin Lighteners Market in APAC 2016-2020 Global Foundation Cream Market 2016-2020 Do you need a report on a market in a specific geographical cluster or country but can't find what you're looking for?

By Tareq Haddad October 16, 2016 17:39 BST Hair firm GHD to be bought out by American cosmetics giant Coty, Sky News reportsGetty US beauty giant Coty is reportedly buying out British hair products firm GHD, Sky Sports has claimed. The New York-based company has more than 70 high-end brands to its name – such as Calvin Klein, Clairol, Marc Jacobs, Rimmel and Wella – and is "close to sealing" the takeover of GHD, the outlet has said. Anonymous banking sources confirmed the deal could be announced this month. One unsuccessful bidder told Sky that the deal could be "well in excess of £400m ($487m, €444m). The report comes three months after Coty purchased three divisions of Proctor and Gamble's company for $12bn (£7.7bn, €10.7bn at the time of purchase). P&G's hair care, fragrance and cosmetics businesses were auctioned off after the company was looking to sell several non-core assets as part of a cost-cutting strategy. The acquisition made Coty one of the world's biggest beauty groups. However, the firm appears to have not stopped its sights there with its reported plans for GHD. Sky understands Coty saw off rival bids from CVC Capital Partners and Panasonic. GHD was put up for sale earlier this year by its owner, the private equity firm Lion Capital, with Rothschild hired to handle the auction. The company manufactures a wide range of straighteners, curling products and hairdryers, and is understood to boast a strong innovation pipeline, developed with the aid of new technologies. In the UK, GHD products are sold in upmarket outlets such as Harvey Nichols and Selfridges, with the company keen to expand its international reach by growing sales in countries such as Brazil, China, India and South Korea. According to Sky, documents sent to prospective buyers disclosed that it made £33.7m ($41.1m, €37.4m) in pre-tax profit in its 2015-16 financial year, on sales up 9.5% to £181.2m ($220.8m, €201.3m). The firm has been run by Anthony Davey, a former P&G executive, since 2014.

Recently Jack along with his principal John Slattery and Ms. Frawley entered a competition for brave children who have overcome personal difficulties and still manage to compete in sports. The competition was called ‘Thank you mum’, a campaign to recognise the influence and support Irish mums give to all their children. This competition was sponsored by Proctor and Gamble. During the visit Katie spoke of Jack’s unbelievable courage and said she was honoured to meet both Jack and his twin sister Amy, both 2nd class pupils in Corville. Katie acknowledged the tremendous work done by Jack’s parents Enda and Linda and also the school community. Katie also remarked on the wonderful sports facilities that Corville has to offer the present and future children of Roscrea. Mr. Slattery thanked Katie for an unforgettable day that will live long in the memories of every child and adult present. “Katie is an inspiration to our community and she is a credit to her own mum”. Katie was very generous with her time and addressed all the pupils at length in the school before leading a 45 minute PE session with Jack’s class. Katie left the school, leaving behind big dreams for the boys and girls to achieve and several sets signed boxing gloves that will be raffled by the school during the year. Mr. Slattery remarked that Katie is one of the most down to earth people he has ever met and that she would be a natural teacher.

Coty, which owns hair colour brands such as Wella and Clairol, became the global No 2 in hair colour and styling products through its $12.5bn acquisition of Procter & Gamble’s perfume, hair care and makeup businesses in October. London-based ghd generated £178m in revenue in fiscal year 2016. The business will become part of Coty’s professional beauty unit, which services salon owners and professionals in hair and nail care, and will be a standalone business led by its current chief executive Anthony Davey and team, Coty said on Monday. The all-cash deal, to conclude by the end of 2016, is expected to immediately add to Coty’s earnings, the company said. Coty said last year it would shift its executive team to London, as part of its transformation into a global beauty products maker. Lion Capital and ghd are being advised by Rothschild & Co and Proskauer Rose LLP. Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP is the legal adviser to Coty.

Last week, six large companies announced they would work together to educate consumers about paper and wood products certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). The businesses include International Paper, Kimberly-Clark, HP, McDonald’s, Procter & Gamble and Williams Sonoma. These firms join nonprofit partners WWF, Sierra Club and National Wildlife Federation in the effort to showcase FSC’s brand and reputation. Other companies joining this campaign include outdoor gear companies Burton and Patagonia; the furniture maker West Elm; and home furnishings giant Pottery Barn. All of these companies either produce paper products, manufacture goods from timber or, in the case of HP, use paper extensively within their supply chain. FSC, and its large corporate partners, cite the oft-noted statistics that the world’s forests are host to about 80 percent of the world’s biodiversity and provide an economic lifeline for at least 1.6 billion people. The timing is definitely spot on, as this accelerated push to amplify FSC’s messages and its benefits comes at a time when deforestation is often in the headlines. Relentless fires across Indonesia could have caused as many as 100,000 deaths last year, and the ongoing bad news about palm oil offers other industries an opportunity to shine and spotlight their work on managing forests. Yet there are also positive signs, as more companies have partnered with NGOs in order to halt the destruction of what is one of the world’s most important carbon sinks. Initiatives such as the Bonn Challenge show promise to restore more of the world’s forests. Environmental NGOs have long touted the FSC’s certification systems as they are designed to stop the harvest of rare old-growth forests, slash the use of hazardous chemicals, protect water quality, and engage local communities with a particular focus on protecting the human rights of indigenous peoples. The problem with this over-produced ‘One Simple Action’ agenda, however, is that it is heavy on public relations campaigning, blares loudly like an advertisement to purchase from certain brands and, quite frankly, is low on substance. And therein lies a huge opening for more criticism, as the FSC has garnered its fair share of detractors. Greenpeace, for example, acknowledged that the FSC has been critical to improving the performance of companies within the paper and timber industries. But the problem, according to a 2013 report, is that FSC-certified operators have been involved with dubious forestry practices and are ensnared in conflict with local communities from Brazil and Indonesia to the Congo Basin. Another company that has been committed to FSC certification, the furniture giant Ikea, was accused by the Guardian of logging old-growth forests in northwestern Russia. It is true that no certification system is going to be perfect. The palm oil industry is struggling to stop deforestation with its sustainable standards organization, the RSPO. The global beef sector is making moves to mitigate its impact on people and the planet. Ongoing revelations of human rights violations show the garment industry has a long road ahead to score consumer trust, and this sector clearly could benefit a centralized sustainability standards system analogous to FSC. Nevertheless, the evidence suggests FSC has much work to do to ensure that all of its operators and participating brands are truly compliant and committed to stopping deforestation, rather than patting themselves on the back. These leading brands’ commitments do indeed give the organization a shot in the arm. But what FSC and its partners need to do now is leverage the power of these organizations to ensure their systems are truly rigorous if they are going to score the buy-in of the skeptics out in the marketplace.

Can you pay for retirement with dividends instead of interest? Nathan Bachrach, Ed Finke and Amy Wagner 12:04 a.m. EDT October 17, 2016 . (Photo: .) Twice every week, Simply Money’s Nathan Bachrach, Ed Finke and Amy Wagner are answering your financial questions. If you, a friend, or someone in your family has a money issue or problem, please feel free to send those questions toyourmoney@enquirer.com Margaret from Western Hills: This is a question about stock dividends. With bond and certificate of deposit interest so low, and a good number of stocks paying dividends above 3 percent, is it possible to pay for retirement with dividends instead of interest? Answer: As a purely mathematical issue, yes, it is possible to cover some or all of your retirement expenses with dividends (assuming, of course, you actually own enough of the underlying dividend-paying stocks). This is quite common with investors who’ve either inherited a large position in one or two stock holdings, or accumulated a significant holding via employment, e.g. Procter & Gamble. The real question is whether you should utilize this strategy even if it’s mathematically possible. A well-diversified portfolio which includes interest-bearing investments does much more than just provide income. Owning bonds, as well as stocks, spreads your risk and limits instability during hectic market cycles (think of them as “shock absorbers”). Generating income is – like most elements of investing – a trade-off between risks and rewards. Make sure you understand both before overweighting your portfolio in any one particular direction.

Credit Photograph by Brian Babineau / NBAE via Getty Last month, as an increasing number of professional athletes followed the lead of Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, by sitting or kneeling during the national anthem, the National Basketball Association and the National Basketball Players Association together issued a memo to the league’s players, soliciting ideas for creating “positive change.” The memo informed players that the league and the union were working together to formulate their own suggestions. “These ideas are based on the actions many of you have already taken or supported,” the memo read, “including convening community conversations in NBA markets to engage young people, parents, community leaders and law enforcement in a candid dialogue.” A few days before the memo went out, I spoke with Mark Tatum, the N.B.A.’s deputy commissioner and chief operating officer, about how the league was preparing for the upcoming season, given the wave of political protests in the sports world. The N.B.A., he said, would not only support players in expressing their views but also work to further the discussion. “The conversations are really about moving beyond symbolic gestures and moving towards real action,” Tatum told me, sitting in his Manhattan office. “What are the things we can do in our community to make a difference, and to continue the conversation in making a difference?” As the No. 2 man in the league office, under the commissioner, Adam Silver, Tatum has maintained a low profile. (If N.B.A. fans recognize him at all, it’s as the guy who takes over for Silver at the podium on draft night when the second round begins.) But he has played an influential role in shaping the league’s message over the years. He has a large portfolio of responsibilities, overseeing global partnerships, marketing, and communications, as well as team marketing and business operations. In addition to being one of the N.B.A.’s key decision-makers, he is also, as the son of a Caymanian father and Chinese mother, the highest-ranking executive of color in a major American sports league. Tatum grew up in East Flatbush, a predominantly African-American and Caribbean neighborhood in Brooklyn. His parents met while his father, Charlie, who grew up in Jamaica and immigrated to the U.S. at eighteen years old, was serving in Vietnam as a member of the United States Air Force. As a kid, Tatum was often reminded of how different he was from everyone, a divide that grew when he attended a mostly white junior high school in Bensonhurst. Later, though, at the more diverse Brooklyn Technical High School, Tatum came to celebrate difference. “I’ve always had this appreciation of different cultures, different races, and the importance of bridging that and understanding different points of views and perspectives,” Tatum said. “That’s helped color my thinking as I’ve grown up throughout life.” Tatum also has an appreciation for how to craft an appealing message for a broad swath of consumers. Following high school, he went to Cornell; once he had decided that being pre-med was a mistake, he turned to business management and marketing. After graduation, he went to work for Procter & Gamble and the Clorox Company, before landing a job in the sports-marketing division of PepsiCo. He returned to school to get an M.B.A. from Harvard, and the year he finished that degree he took a job in corporate sponsorship and marketing at Major League Baseball. One year later, David Stern, then the N.B.A. commissioner, hired him away, making him the N.B.A.’s director of marketing and media. In 2015, Richard Lapchick, the director of the Institute of Diversity and Ethics in Sport, gave the N.B.A. an A-plus for racial hiring practices and a B-plus for gender-related hiring practices, the highest marks of any sports league. “It’s a wonderful feeling to be at a place where you are valued for bringing different ideas,” Tatum said. “We recognize having diverse points of views makes us better.” But when players express their diverse points of view on controversial topics, leagues often struggle with how best to respond. Twenty years ago, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, a guard for the Denver Nuggets, declined to stand for the national anthem, and he was suspended indefinitely by the N.B.A. The league relented after one game, when Abdul-Rauf agreed to stand for the anthem on the condition that he be allowed to bow his head in prayer. “I think the world has changed in the last twenty years,” Tatum said, when I asked him about that precedent. In July, the Women’s National Basketball Association, which is backed by the N.B.A., fined players on three teams and their organizations for wearing black T-shirts during pregame warmups to protest recent shootings by, and violence perpetrated against, police officers. After a social-media backlash, the W.N.B.A. rescinded the fines. Commissioner Silver expressed support for the women, while adding that he wanted all players to adhere to their leagues’ uniform rules. “I would greatly prefer that the players use the platform they’re given,” Silver said at a meeting of the board of governors in July. “Social media, press conferences, media in locker rooms, however they want to do it, to make their political points of view be known.” That incident seems to have informed the approach the N.B.A. is taking now. That approach is also doubtless informed by the makeup of the league itself: Lapchick estimates that, in 2015, nearly three-quarters of N.B.A. players were African-American, and a number of those players have experienced not only racism but police brutality and gun violence. Last year, Thabo Sefolosha, the Atlanta Hawks forward, suffered a broken right fibula in an altercation with police officers outside a New York night club. (In April, he filed a lawsuit against five New York police officers for false arrest and use of excessive force.) In August, Nykea Aldridge, the first cousin of Dwyane Wade, the Chicago Bulls guard and perennial All-Star, was shot and killed in Chicago, after two men fired at a third man and struck her instead. This was six weeks after Wade joined LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, and Chris Paul onstage at the ESPY Awards to urge fellow-athletes to become more active in their communities. After the ESPYs, Anthony organized a town-hall event with officers from the Los Angeles Police Department, community leaders, and African-American and Latino teen-agers. Tatum pointed to Anthony’s event specifically when discussing the league’s encouragement of social involvement. “They are some of the most prominent African-American athletes in our country and in our world,” Tatum noted. “They have the ability to influence positive action through their own individual and collective actions.” As the preseason has gotten under way, multiple teams have fashioned a new approach to the national anthem that acknowledges recent protests while presenting a less confrontational image: players on the New York Knicks, Toronto Raptors, and Houston Rockets all locked arms during the anthem, in displays of unity. The Boston Celtics held hands, calling for “unity, progress and love.” The Milwaukee Bucks stood together in a line during the national anthem at a recent preseason game, putting their arms around one another. “We’re not protesting,” Jason Kidd, the head coach of the Bucks, told reporters. “We’re showing unity. There’s not a protest.” Alex Wong is a writer in New York.

While we happily lavish time, money and care on our hair, there’s scarcely any attention paid to what lies beneath. Astonishingly, a recent survey* discovered half of women in the UK don’t even think of their scalp as skin. However we’re doing ourselves a huge disservice. "Healthy hair starts with a healthy scalp," says Kathy Rogerson, from P&G scientific communications. "Your scalp ages just as your face does, and having scalp problems will only add to the natural decline in hair quality as you get older." Even just scratching your head can damage your hair follicles. The D-word Tackle dandruff straight away (Photo: (c) The Power of Forever Photography) While it’s embarrassing to have flakes on your shoulders, dandruff isn’t just a cosmetic issue. New research has found that dandruff causes free radical damage to the scalp, which affects the quality of the hair. "Hair is likely to be weaker as it emerges and prone to breakage," says Kathy. The problem can get worse the longer it’s left. "Untreated dandruff can turn into seborrhoeic dermatitis, a thick, stuck-on yellow scale," says trichologist Sally-Ann Tarver . "It makes the scalp sore, and can even cause hair loss." Dandruff is caused by a fungal yeast we all have on our scalp, which feeds on the skin’s natural oils. If you’re dandruff prone, this leads to irritation, which makes the cells clump together. Result: flakes. The first step is to use a dedicated anti-dandruff shampoo. "This reduces the yeast and helps exfoliate and break down the scale,’" says Sally-Ann. "But if the scale is thick, you might need a professional descaling treatment. It’s also important to wash frequently to keep the yeast under control. It’s a myth hair is self-cleansing, you’ll just get a build-up of the oil the yeast feeds on." Is it dandruff or dehydration? Just to confuse things, itching, tightness and flaking can also be caused by a dry scalp, rather than dandruff. "I’d say if you’re not seeing a benefit from medicated shampoo in a few weeks, the problem is more likely to be dryness," says Sally-Ann. "A dry scalp is largely down to the body being dehydrated, and the biggest answer is simply to drink lots of water." She also recommends deep-moisturising your scalp by applying coconut oil overnight. There's the rub... Try a scalp massage (Photo: Getty) Dry scalp massage can help stimulate growth, but you have to do it properly says Sally-Ann. "Don’t slide your fingers round in circles – you can physically rub the hair away. I’ve seen people who’ve given themselves friction alopecia this way. You need to move just your scalp with your fingertips, not your hair." Adding a few drops of almond or sesame seed oil is also great for moisturising the scalp, even if you don’t have a specific scalp issue. Product watch Product build-up can aggravate the scalp, says Sally-Ann. "A lot of styling products are full of plastics and alcohol, which is fine on hair, but potentially irritating to skin. If your scalp is dehydrated, it absorbs more of what you put on it, which can make dryness worse." Her advice? Keep styling products on the hair, rather than letting them go to your head. Model behaviour Our model (above) is none other than Britain’s Next Top Model winner Chloe Keenan (and we can confirm she has a very lovely, non-flaky scalp). My hair is always being styled sprayed with products. Luckily, I don’t have dandruff, but I was given the Head & Shoulders range, as they’re the official BNTM partners, and I’ve carried on using them ever since. The Smooth & Silky range is great – it gets rid of product build-up and keeps my hair in good condition. Scalp savers ● Head & Shoulders 3Action Formula Shampoo and Conditioner Smooth & Silky, from £2.99 Fight those flakes A new skincare-inspired ‘cleanse, protect and moisturise’ tech that’s now in the whole H&S range. They’ve worked out a way to shrink the anti-dandruff actives, so they can get deeper into the follicles – so no place for yeast to hide. Having tiny particles also means your hair is left super-soft and smooth, so there’s no trade-off between scalp health and lovely locks. ● Kérastase DermoCalm scalp soother, £17.90 Soothe soreness In two versions for dry and combination hair, this is designed to calm dry, sensitive scalps. There’s also a new Scalp Purification salon treatment, from £85, which involves a detoxing clay mask and deep exfoliation using a sonic cleanser. ● Wet Brush Pro Sugar Skull, £12.99 Be kind to tangles Rigid brushes can be too hard or scratchy on delicate scalps (also chuck out any brush that’s lost its protective ‘bobbles’ as it’ll rip into your skin). The ultra-flexy Wet Brush is soft on scalps and tangly hair, and we love this month’s new Fright Night designs. ● Plantur 39 Phyto-Caffeine Tonic, £9.99 Encourages hair growth This leave-in scalp tonic is designed for women 40+ worried about thinning hair. Caffeine wakes up ageing hair follicles, which in turn helps reduce hair fall-out. *Head & Shoulders global survey on scalp health Sally-Ann Tarver is at the Cotswold Trichology Centre .

Trump said Buffett, the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., “took a massive deduction,” which prompted Buffett to issue a press release the next day saying he hadn’t. Since then, tax policy has been getting a thorough discussion, with partisan viewpoints ruling many of the comments. Marty Davis, CEO of Cambria Holdings and Sun Country Airlines, said on talk show host Laura Ingraham’s program, broadcast on Omaha’s KOIL radio station, among others, that Buffett is a tax avoider because he donates untaxed stock gains to charities, does not pay taxable dividends to shareholders and plans to leave almost his entire estate to nonprofit foundations. It’s fine to use legal tax policy to reduce your taxes, Davis said, but then you can’t brag about how much tax you pay, while arguing that rich people should pay more taxes. When Berkshire buys a company, Davis said, any taxable dividend that company had been paying goes directly to Berkshire and is no longer subject to taxes. Although I’m not a tax expert, it seems to me that any money that goes to Berkshire — whether it’s profits from Geico or the price of a Dilly Bar — contributes to Berkshire’s profits and is taxable. Berkshire paid $10.5 billion in income taxes last year. Forbes magazine ranked Berkshire as the eighth-largest corporate taxpayer in the country. Next month we’ll find out if Berkshire is on track for another year of $20 billion-plus in taxable profits. Washington Post columnist Allan Sloan, who has criticized Trump’s business practices in earlier columns, estimated that Berkshire avoided $2.5 billion in capital gains taxes through complicated “cash-rich split-off” transactions involving Phillips 66, the Post and Procter & Gamble. The IRS treated the transaction as tax-free trades rather than sales, and they’re not illegal or unethical, Sloan wrote. While Buffett’s personal tax practices “qualify him for sainthood,” Sloan wrote, “Buffett the CEO’s tax practices qualify him … to be a CEO, trying to maximize profits for his shareholders. “His behavior is much better than Trump’s, because Berkshire is highly profitable and pays substantial income taxes. But Buffett the CEO is no saint — and it’s a mistake to think of him as one.” In Forbes magazine, tax CPA Peter J. Reilly wrote that Buffett’s 2015 charitable contributions, $2.85 billion, far exceed the allowable charitable deductions he could take for hundreds of years, even if the law didn’t say that type of deduction expires after five years. Those who make charitable contributions certainly think about deductions but also want their money to accomplish something. The wise use of charitable money can ease the burden on taxpayers by doing things that the government can’t or won’t. Expanding in the food industry? Berkshire’s sale of its minority interest in Wrigley to Mars Inc. could mean job cuts for the chewing gum company while freeing up money for Buffett to invest in, for example, the food industry. That’s the view of analyst Dean Best, writing for industry website just-food.com. Eight years ago Berkshire put up $4.4 billion toward Mars’ $23 billion purchase of Wrigley and paid $2.1 billion for its share of Wrigley when the sale closed. This month Mars said it had bought Berkshire’s share of Wrigley and would integrate the two companies into Mars Wrigley Confectionery, with brands like Orbit gum and Snickers candy bars. The company said some jobs will go, especially at the senior leadership and management levels, Best wrote, emphasizing the goal is growth and not saving money. The combination “looks set to allow the privately owned business a greater ability to use its scale, making what is already the world’s largest candy maker an even more formidable competitor,” Best wrote. Buffett may be interested in expanding in the food industry, the story said, citing continuing speculation that a possible target is Mondelez International. Mondelez’s products include chocolates, gum, candy, beverages, cheese, grocery items and “biscuits,” which we would generally call cookies and crackers such as Oreo and Nabisco. Mondelez, based in Deerfield, Illinois, took that name in 2011 when Kraft Foods split into two companies. The grocery division ended up merging with H.J. Heinz as Kraft Heinz, now partly owned by Berkshire. Mondelez’s publicly traded stock is worth about $65 billion. Still not on the Harvard list Luckily, Buffett didn’t make the Harvard Business Review’s latest list of the 100 best-performing CEOs in the world. That would have broken a string of snubs that dates to 1950, when a Harvard admissions interviewer rejected Buffett’s application for graduate school. The school was looking for leaders, not financial geniuses, as biographer Alice Schroeder wrote. Buffett has joked that the Harvard alumni office may regret that decision these days. For this year’s rankings, the Review calculated the financial success of 895 CEOs from 32 countries over the past decade, plus the Environmental, Social and Governance performances of their companies, resulting in an ESG ranking by the Sustainalytics consulting firm. Last year Buffett also failed to make the list, and the Review noted that Berkshire’s meager ESG disclosures doomed his chances of a high total ranking. Annual reports of European business, especially, spend considerable space reporting on their companies’ social and environmental policies, while U.S. corporations tend to focus just on the money. No. 1 on this year’s list is Lars Robien Sorensen of the Danish health care firm Novo Nordisk. The only American in the top 10 was Jen Hsun Huang of Nvidia, a Santa Clara, California, computer graphics company. In an August round-table discussion with others on the list, Sorensen said: “To be honest, I think we’re highly overrated. At least in my business, success is far more of a team effort than the public would like to believe, especially in America.” Berkshire Hathaway Inc. owns the Omaha World-Herald. steve.jordon@owh.com, 402-444-1080, twitter.com/buffettOWH Find more of The World-Herald's coverage of Warren Buffett here.

Beauty Inc., the cosmetics company that went public on Sept. 22, has a business process that analysts at Cowen & Company describe as a “‘fast fashion’ execution,” one of many reasons to have a positive outlook on the company’s future. “E.L.F.’s low price points (average unit retail at Walmart/Target is about $2 to $3) combined with millennial, multicultural, and beauty enthusiast appeal should drive a combination of distribution and comp growth,” analysts wrote in a note published Monday. Cowen initiated E.L.F. ELF, -0.27%   at outperform on Monday with a $32 price target. It’s one of a number of initiations, and analysts are bullish about the newly public company. See also: 5 things to know about E.L.F. Beauty Cowen says E.L.F. can “deliver product to market in as little as 20 weeks, versus traditional cosmetics companies where it takes 24 months.” That is one of five factors for its upbeat note, including low market share with a high threshold for growth, a focus on product innovation that creates demand, and a younger customer base (46% are between the ages of 18 and 34) who are highly engaged. Analysts at Stifel also highlight the company’s growth potential, with expanding store distribution at both existing and new retailers just one reason to be optimistic. Among the retailers selling E.L.F. products are Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -0.53%  , Target Corp. TGT, -0.34%   and CVS Health Corp. CVS, -0.31%  , along with its own stores and online platform. “The company has significant white space in the U.S. market and longer-term potential internationally, in our view, particularly given its value proposition for national retailers, which make up over 80% of revenues,” analysts wrote in a Monday note. “Although we have no knowledge of any M&A negotiations or discussions, we believe E.L.F. is an attractive acquisition target given favorable category trends and domestic and international white space, providing down-side protection to E.L.F. shares in the near-to-medium term,” the note also said. Analysts believe Coty Inc. COTY, +0.46%   would be the most logical buyer due to its focus on sales growth and scale after acquiring a number of Procter & Gamble Co. PG, -0.91%   fragrance licenses. See also: Coty buys hair straightener maker Ghd J.P. Morgan said that it’s optimistic about the multi-year outlook for E.L.F. not only for the reasons outlined by Cowen and Stifel, but also because the company’s website “lowers marketing spend and enables an asset-light model with fast go-to-market innovation.” Greater use of social media is also facilitating a rise in the use of makeup. “The ‘selfie’ generation wants to look good, is less loyal to prestige brands and is highly influenced by bloggers, and online reviews,” the note said. “We view the company as a clear disruptor in an attractive industry.” See also: ‘The Amazon effect’ and 3 other things to watch for this holiday shopping season Shares of the company are up about 60% in Monday trading from the $17 public offering price. J.P. Morgan analysts say the spike in share price, plus a third quarter that will likely be difficult, are reasons to “wait for a better entry point.” J.P. Morgan rates E.L.F. shares neutral with a $28 price target. The beauty company was also started at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey at buy with a $32 price target. E.L.F. stock is down 3.6% for the month to date, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.22%   is down 1.8% for the same period.

Coty has snapped up the hair straightener and hairdryer manufacturer from private equity firm Lion Capital, which is understood to have put the company up for sale earlier this year. Share Facebook Twitter Google Email Go To Comments The all-cash deal is expected to be sealed by the end of 2016, if it wins the backing of regulators. Camillo Pane, Coty chief executive, said: " Not only do we expect GHD to strengthen our professional hair portfolio and enable Coty to provide even better hair solutions, but we also believe there is strong growth potential for GHD across several markets." The move for GHD, which stands for good hair day, comes just two weeks after Coty secured a merger with Procter & Gamble's Speciality Beauty Business. GHD notched up revenues of £178 million in the 2015-16 financial year across its international operations in Europe, Australia, South Africa and the US. Lyndon Lea, partner of Lion Capital, said: "Over the three years of our ownership, GHD grew worldwide sales by 30% through a strong pipeline of innovative new products, which deepened the brand's leadership in its core markets and supported its successful entry into new hairstyling categories." US and Asian companies are said to have ramped up their interest in British firms as they look to capitalise on sterling's collapse following the EU referendum result. However, it is unclear whether sterling's 18% drop against the US dollar since the Brexit vote had any bearing on Coty's decision. Coty is one of the world's largest beauty companies, with 9 billion US dollars (£7.4 billion) in revenues.

The business has increased global sales 30 percent over the past three years, bringing in 178 million pounds in revenue during fiscal year 2016, according to a statement on Monday. GHD sells hair straighteners, dryers and curlers at salons and high-end retailers, as well as online. The deal marks Coty’s first acquisition since it completed the purchase earlier this month of 41 Procter & Gamble Co. beauty brands, including Gucci fragrances, CoverGirl cosmetics and Max Factor makeup. That deal made Coty the world’s third-biggest cosmetics company and the largest in fragrance. The GHD transaction takes advantage of the British pound’s decline, said Jason Gere, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. Still, it means one more thing for Coty to digest. “It does add another element to an increasingly full plate for management to handle right now,” he said. Coty shares gained 0.4 percent to $23.43 in New York on Monday. The stock had declined 8.9 percent this year through the end of last week. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

"Following" : "Follow"}} October 17, 2016 9:08am   Comments Share: Related Wall Street's M&A Chatter From November 11-13 20 Biggest Mid-Day Losers For Wednesday Michael Burry (Of The Big Short) Adds To Oversold Names (Seeking Alpha) An article by Sky News suggested that Coty Inc (NYSE: COTY) is in talks to acquire Good Hair Day [GHD], a UK-based manufacturer of high-end hair care products, for substantially more than £400 million. The potential acquisition would offset about half of the dilution from Coty’s planned brand divestitures and boost total sales growth by ~30bps, Barclays’ Lauren Lieberman said in a report. Analyst Lieberman maintained an Equal-weight rating on Coty, with a price target of $28. She mentioned that the price suggested exceeds $468 million using the current exchange rate. While the Sky News article indicated that the deal could be announced as early as later in October, there have been no official comments regarding the potential acquisition. Bigger Than Expected “While it is widely known that Coty intends to build out its beauty portfolio via acquisition less than a month after the RMT with P&G Specialty Beauty, a potential deal for GHD would surely be sooner and bigger than expected,” Lieberman commented. There has been concern around dilution from Coty’s panned exit of 6-8 percent of pro-forma sales.

Prior to his appointment at Snapdeal, which is run by Jasper Infotech Pvt. Ltd, Desai spent nearly three years at Groupon as a vice president where he led product and engineering functions, encompassing aspects like logistics management, seller and interface experiences. Before Groupon, Pradeep spent 11 years at e-tailer Amazon.com, where he worked in various capacities across key departments such as logistics, advertising and marketing. He is an alumnus of The University of Texas at Austin and IIT Madras. “Pradeep will lead a team whose mandate is to implement a range of additional supply chain innovations to Snadeal’s delivery experience. All our initiatives bring us closer to our mission of building India’s most reliable and frictionless commerce ecosystem.” said Rajiv Mangla, chief technology officer at Snapdeal, on the appointment. In May, Snapdeal’s chief product officer (CPO) Anand Chandrasekaran had quit the company. He has now joined social network website Facebook to help develop strategies for its Messenger app. In April this year, Snapdeal hired former Zoomcar executive Mayank Jain as head of growth. Zoomcar is a self-drive car rental startup. Last year, Snapdeal appointed Jeyandran Venugopal from Yahoo! as its technology adviser. Other high level appointments include Procter & Gamble executive Amit Choudhary who became senior vice president of corporate finance and former Unilever executive Vivek Patankar who was hired as senior vice president of finance. Snapdeal recently rebranded itself by launching a new logo and tagline ‘Unbox Zindagi’. It also launched next-day free delivery and a private cloud service called Snapdeal Cirrus. Last month, Snapdeal established a wholesale unit, called E-Agility Pvt. Ltd., to buy products that will be sold to consumers directly, following in the footsteps of rivals Flipkart and Amazon. The unit will fund vendors and bring on board fashion brands that sell directly to e-commerce firms as fashion constitutes 20-30% of Snapdeal’s business. Like this report?

Business James Ashton: 'Safe hands' Carney should stay in London James Ashton Monday 17 October 2016 11:14 BST Mark Carney should stay in London, where the action is PA It would reflect poorly on Mark Carney if the spat that has developed between Downing Street and the Bank of England convinces him not to extend his tenure in Threadneedle Street. “Brits don’t quit” hasn’t got quite the ring to it that it used to have but surely Canadians have more staying power? The Bank Governor is rightly miffed that Theresa May would challenge his stewardship, specifically the side-effects of ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing on savers. As politicians squabbled in the days after the Brexit vote, Carney was the only authority figure taking decisive action to shore up the economy. As soon as May has found her stride, this is the thanks he gets. But authority figures should expect to be challenged from time to time. The trouble is that Carney, the UK’s most powerful unelected figure, hasn’t faced much opposition to his leadership since he arrived in summer 2013, dictating terms immediately. Not for him the eight-year posting that was advertised. Instead, demonstrating extraordinary bargaining power, he said he would serve five. Now that Carney is mulling whether to put in the eight-year term after all, he will have noted the weather has changed. Although the tension is nothing like that which existed when Alistair Darling and Mervyn King were handling the financial crisis together, gone are the cordial relations Carney enjoyed with George Osborne as both benefited from an early economic revival. It was thought the only woman who would influence his decision to stay in London would be his wife, Diana. When Carney was appointed, she told her Twitter followers that “we’ll be back in 5”. The Prime Minister — who is free to alter the Bank’s mandate — should weigh in too and urge him to remain. Not only is Carney viewed as a safe pair of hands but, as chairman of the Financial Stability Board, he also brings a valuable international dimension just as the UK is refashioning its role on the world stage. More importantly, he must be up for it. At the annual Mansion House bankers’ dinner a couple of years ago, he joked about one of his predecessors, Montagu Norman, who fled to Quebec just as the sterling crisis forced the UK off the gold standard. Given the uncertainty of Brexit, I can see why academics might consider deserting for bigger research grants in the US, or car manufacturers might weigh up the Eastern European option.  But for a central banker, given what the UK must go through over the next few years, London is surely where the action is. Where real threat from Unilever lies Last week’s Marmite wars brought to mind a conversation with Google co-founder Larry Page several years ago.  Rather than boasting about his hand in creating a multi-billion-dollar game-changer, he compared his business to making toothbrushes. Page’s entrepreneurial advice was: keep it simple, sell something that people will use every day, take a small cut and go global. Until now, I couldn’t see much of a connection between technology and grocery, other than filling out the weekly Ocado order. But the row with Tesco, caused by Unilever’s suggested blanket 10% price increase to compensate for the weak pound hitting the cost of its raw materials, is just one part of a bigger skirmish. Short of top-line growth since emerging markets cooled, grocery groups are convinced that cutting out the middle-man retailer would be great for business. For Unilever, Procter & Gamble and the rest, utilising e-commerce might just be the biggest innovation since consumers stopped taking two bottles into the shower. Going direct-to-consumer has disintermediated everything from record labels to travel agents in the past decade and its impact is already noticeable in the supermarket aisles. Nestlé made a splash by selling its Nespresso capsules direct, and few would have thought Graze, a snacks-by-post outfit, would have progressed sufficiently for US private-equity group Carlyle to gobble it up. Unilever chief Paul Polman made a big noise in summer about his purchase of the disruptive Dollar Shave Club, which won 5% of the US razor blade market in only three years with a monthly delivery service. He told analysts the e-commerce model could be applied to 30% of his company’s product range, especially its skincare lotions and potions. Polman is gambling on what used to be known as mail order going mainstream. During its third-quarter earnings call last week, Unilever disclosed that in China e-commerce was 3% of sales two years ago but today accounts for more than 10%.  Instead of funding promotions in supermarkets where footfall is falling, why shouldn’t Polman do it himself, and at the same time keep hold of the valuable consumer data that is logged on the retailer’s loyalty card? If he is successful, Tesco will have more to worry about than simply passing on price rises.

Everstone has interests in food businesses, real estate parks, industrial warehouses and so on. Photo: Abhijit Bhatlekar/Mint Mumbai: About seven years ago, when Sameer Sain was raising funds for Everstone Capital Management’s second private equity (PE) fund (Everstone Capital Partners II), the former managing director at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. got turned down by an investment manager of a university endowment fund who came very close to making an investment but eventually balked. The endowment fund chose a lesser- known rival over Everstone, the investment management firm Sain founded with his former Goldman Sachs colleague Atul Kapur in 2006. The decision baffled Sain and Kapur. A few days later, in a casual meeting in Hong Kong with the investor, Sain found out the reason. It wasn’t what they expected. “I get the feeling that you and Atul are too Goldman Sachs, very confident, in your expensive suits and watches, you seem to have an articulate answer for everything. Basically you come across as too slick while the other guys seem more real and humble,” was what the manager told them. Since then, Sain has more than proved his fundraising prowess. Everstone has assets under management in excess of $3.3 billion across PE and real estate. This, in a short span of 10 years, is no mean achievement. The rise of the firm has certainly caught the eye of peers and the perception is that Everstone is a fundraising machine. Sain disagrees. “The perception that we are a great fundraiser is wrong,” he says. “The marquee global LPs (limited partners), many of whom are our investors, are much smarter than you think. They are committing to a manager in a blind pool for a very long time with no liquidity. A lot of work and thought goes into the decision on which manager to back.” Everstone has assets under management of about $3.3 billion across private equity and real estate “I would be a great fundraiser if I had a seven- or eight- person team, sat in a small office with minimal infrastructure and skin in the game, and then raised $3 billion. Currently I would say I’m a poor fundraiser: I put more money in my funds than almost all my peers, I have the largest team of talented people with whom I share economics, five offices with massive infrastructure and overheads, and a very stable, solid firm,” adds Sain. “All the players in our industry charge the same fees but each one is very different. It’s analogous to all the cars in the showroom being the same price. At Everstone we have built a Ferrari but we charge the same as someone offering a Fiat. And yes, I accept that a Ferrari is slick,” quips Sain, taking a jibe at that investment manager while recounting the incident. “Atul and I are not going to apologize,” he says, adding, “We have years of strong experience at a global firm like Goldman Sachs and almost 100% of our own hard-earned money is invested alongside our investors.” There is merit in what Sain says. The duo, who quit their jobs at Goldman Sachs in 2006 to start Everstone, have invested several million dollars of their own in their funds. In addition, they have invested a huge amount on their platform and on talent. "I would say I’m a poor fundraiser: I put more money in my funds than almost all my peers, I have the largest team of talented people with whom I share economics, five offices with massive infrastructure and overheads, and a very stable, solid firm"- Sameer Sain, co-founder, Everstone Capital Such commitment is seen as a stamp of faith in the asset management industry and goes down very well with limited partners (LPs), or the investors in a fund. “Skin in the game”, as it is referred to in industry parlance, is fast becoming a norm and being embraced by quite a few fund managers. But the quantum of their personal commitment definitely stands out. “Atul and I both worked at Goldman Sachs for 11-12 years each. We met back in 1994 and have been close friends since. We always had the ambition to become entrepreneurs and start our own firm and were lucky that we worked at a meritocratic firm where we did very well and were compensated accordingly. In addition, like many of our peers, we benefited from shares and options when Goldman went public and thus had sufficient capital at an early stage in life to go and take some risks,” says Sain. In 2006, the two partners set up two businesses—one was an asset management business, dealing in PE and real estate; the second was a financial services business. “We did both in partnership with the Future Group. I had an old family relationship with Kishore Biyani and that is how we started this business,” recalls Sain. The relationship, however, did not last long. He adds: “A couple of years into this partnership we took Future Capital public, but we had a different view of how we should proceed in life. So, in a very amicable way, we parted ways. We bought out their share in the asset management business. Over time we started to sell our shares in Future Capital in the market. Eventually that business got sold to Warburg Pincus. In 2006, Sain and Kapur set up two businesses—asset management, dealing in PE and real estate, and financial services “We brought the brand of our overseas business (Everstone) to India and rebranded our operations here and eventually became one regional brand—the Everstone Group,” says Sain. A broken relationship is now a thing of the past. It was, in fact, the genesis of the entrepreneurial powerhouse in the making and one which already has global aspirations. “Everstone is only 10 years old. We started in a small office in London where Atul and I were based. Very quickly we opened five offices (Mumbai, Singapore, Bengaluru, Delhi and Mauritius). Ironically, we shut London eight years ago and physically moved to Asia. Next month, after so many years, we are about to open an office in London to support some cross-border investments and business development,” says Sain. Everstone has four lines of business today: PE, real estate, credit and consumer venture. Click here for enlarge “We are over 200 people across five offices. Headquartered in Singapore, regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (the country’s central bank). Atul and I are both residents of Singapore. The largest office is Mumbai where we have about 80-100 people. And we have a very stable firm, which we have built very carefully over the last 10 years,” says Sain. While Sain and Kapur are the co-founders of the business, it already has a second and third layer in place. “Everstone has built a highly institutionalized platform which operates like the corporate nerve centre of a business group,” says Dhanpal Jhaveri, a managing partner who leads the firm’s PE business. Rajesh Jaggi is managing partner of the real estate business. At the other end of the spectrum, P.M. Devaiah, a partner and general counsel, leads a team of lawyers to ensure that the firm is well protected and functions smoothly. Everstone has four lines of business today: private equity, real estate, credit and consumer venture “We have a lot of trust and faith in each other. As an example, Rajesh Jaggi is not only my partner but also the best real estate investor and developer in India. I trust him 100%, so why should I second-guess him. This trust and culture brings out the best in our people and allows them to excel,” says Sain. PE is essentially a business by the LPs, of the LPs and for the LPs. And what do LPs really want: GPs (general partners) who can repeat and institutionalize success, who can build consistency, legacy and an institutional framework for repeatability, who can incentivize the team well for a long-term alignment, who have the “desire to be successful” as opposed to just being “transaction oriented” and those who have good infrastructure for effective LP communication. “Everstone is building its private equity business in an institutional manner. We have not seen many private equity firms do this. They think along the lines of building long-term businesses, which we like,” says Nupur Garg, regional lead (South Asia) at International Finance Corporation (IFC), part of the World Bank group. IFC is one of the biggest global investors in India, backing roughly two-thirds of the active growth funds investing in unlisted small and mid-cap companies. Click here for enlarge Also, diversity is a key ingredient in the Everstone talent mix—multiple nationalities across its various offices with 30% of its senior team comprising women (seven out of 24 managing or executive directors). The women too have a multinational and global background like Roopa Purushothaman, a former Goldman Sachs senior economist, and Bhavna Thakur, a former director at Citibank and a qualified international lawyer. “Everstone’s ethos of being a business builder adds intrinsic value to our portfolio companies by providing leverage to the portfolio in every aspect of business: whether it be research, branding, marketing, operations, capital markets or mergers and acquisitions,” says Thakur, Everstone managing director for capital markets. “This enables strategic alliances and market intelligence.” "Everstone is building its private equity business in an institutional manner. We have not seen many private equity firms do this. They think along the lines of building long-term businesses, which we like"- Nupur Gard, regional head (South Asia) at IFC Within PE, the firm uses the brand Everstone Capital which is currently investing out of its third fund. The first fund was in partnership with Future Group and called Indivision. The second was Everstone Capital Partners II. The third is Everstone Capital Partners III. The firm currently manages about $2 billion and about $2.3-2.4 billion in actual investments made, including the co-investments. Like any PE firm’s portfolio, Everstone also has its share of the good, the bad and the ugly. “We have our share of challenges from the first fund while fund II is in great shape. We have some fantastic businesses in there, some real winners, including businesses such as IndoStar Capital, Hinduja Leyland Finance, S. Chand and Ozone Overseas. Fund II is going to end up being a strong performer and fund III has gotten off to a good start,” says Sain. He is candid about the first fund’s portfolio and admits that it was a learning curve for them. The firm currently manages about $2 billion and about $2.3-2.4 billion in actual investments made, including the co-investments “Future Group’s e-commerce—the first e-commerce business we backed with Sherpalo and Kleiner Perkins. Probably too early, it’s almost never that a bricks-and-mortar operator enters e-tailing and beats an independent e-commerce player. We thought it would be different in India but we were wrong. Billimoria & Co. was a massive disappointment too. There was a time we could have sold that business for three-four times our investment but in my view we took a bet on the wrong people, besides the cycle was bad for all EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) companies. So we sold that business, we lost half of our money. Moved on,” says Sain. Bad bets are part of the game but seeing Sain being candid about them is unusual in the world of PE. “Both Atul and I have a mindset of control and execution. We shifted that in our first fund because the idea was to go buy into consumer businesses as minority and work with our ex-partner (Future Group) to provide them a distribution platform,” he says. “So we went back to our roots to do what we knew best. Buy businesses, roll up your sleeves and get things done. Execute and build businesses—as we have done with Burger King, ReGen Powertech or with IndoStar—but never ever ignore that there are great people and franchises out there who you can trust and back,” adds Sain. And these are not mere words. Sain is on top of every minuscule activity happening at these firms. He takes out a mobile-like device from the pocket of his blue jacket and takes us through a dashboard on screen where you can see every live cash transaction from every terminal in every Burger King outlet in India. “We control the brand of Burger King for almost 20% of the world population,” asserts Sain, his face lighting up with the sheer joy of ownership. "We went back to our roots to do what we knew best. Buy businesses, roll up your sleeves and get things done. Execute and build businesses, but never ever ignore that there are great people and franchises out there who you can trust and back"- Sameer Sain “There are businesses that we like to control but these businesses need to have science behind them. We bought Modern Bread from Unilever. It came with 60,000 distribution points. Its been a phenomenal one-and-a-half years of headache. We had to carve out the factories, people, the labour union. How many people in India can do that?” he says. “No CEO/CFO, a strong labour union, manufacturing plants in seven different locations and a non-cohesive business culture. We played a video in eight different languages at eight different manufacturing plants about the Everstone Group— to appeal to the factory workers about how their future will be bright with us. (To tell them) what our ambitions were and how we will take the brand back to its glory days,” points out Sain. Now that the hard work is done, it is beginning to bear fruit. “We will do cakes, rusk, cookies and other baked goods. We are going to grow that and make Modern into a Rs2,000-3,000 crore business,” he says. But then there are always some businesses which have more art than science to them. Which is where minority investing comes in, says Sain. "We control the brand of Burger King for almost 20% of the world population"- Sameer Sain, Everstone Group He says: “That’s my view on minority/control. It’s art vs science. If you look at fashion or winemaking, these businesses have a lot of art embedded in them. We own 34% of Ritu Kumar, where design and product selection plays such a vital role. Take Sula, for example. Winemaking is an art and Rajeev Samant is the best at it. That is why we made extraordinary returns by backing Rajeev and eventually exited that business. In such cases, our role changes to a minority investor who provides capital and business discipline. “Within food itself—we own and control Burger King in India—quick service and fast food is largely science with a big focus on quality, supply chain and customer engagement. All mostly science and execution, which is why we can own this business but still have an amazing CEO in Raj Varman. On the other hand, we only own 50% of Massive Restaurants and don’t have any day-to-day management involvement. The promoter and creator of this business, Zorawar Kalra, is a passionate genius. At the fine dining level, its art, not science,” adds Sain. Everstone Capital has invested Rs1,200 crore in F&B Asia, which has under its fold assets such as Pind Balluchi, Harry’s, the Disgruntled Chef, Pan India Food Solutions (also known as Blue Foods), Massive Restaurants, besides the franchise of Domino’s in Indonesia and Burger King in India and Indonesia, among others. “Blue Foods proved to us very early on—don’t try to run art. Outsource it to the artist and give them the structure and financial discipline to make money,” says Sain. Blue Foods operates brands like Spaghetti Kitchen, Copper Chimney, Gelato Italiano, the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, Bombay Blue, Noodle Bar and food courts Food Talk and Spoon. Everstone Capital has invested Rs1,200 crore in F&B Asia, which has under its fold Pind Balluchi, Harry’s, the Disgruntled Chef, Blue Foods and Massive Restaurants “Spaghetti Kitchen was a marque brand, but now with so many new entrants it has become an irrelevant brand. But having said that Gelato is an amazing brand, Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf is the only profitable premium coffee chain in India. Copper Chimney is still an institution. We had to reinvent Noodle Bar. Bombay Blue has a niche following,” notes Sain. “Blue Foods is not a problem, but it’s a disappointment that we will not make as much money as we would have liked. We have a phrase we use called ROTI (return on time invested). In the case of Blue Foods, the ROI (return on investment) may be good but the ROTI won’t be great,” he points out. Besides PE, Everstone has a very large real estate business primarily comprising a shopping mall business called Kshitij/Horizon and the industrials business called IndoSpace. The shopping mall business was started by Future Group originally but post the separation, this business came to Everstone. “We have funded 14 malls across India, of which 10 have been developed entirely by Everstone. We knew nothing about mall development and learnt it the hard way after we inherited the business. Despite so many mistakes early on, we came up the learning curve very quickly. At the end of the day, we’ve actually completed all of these malls and we have sold all of them. To have built and sold so many malls, I like to think we understand retail and real estate both relatively well,” says Sain. “For the IndoSpace business, we partnered with a very good bunch of folks in the US called the Realterm group,” he adds. Realterm is an industrial real estate firm that manages approximately $2.5 billion in assets across 300 operating and development properties in North America, Europe and India. “Co-founders Ken and John (Kenneth S. Code and John W. Cammett) are both very similar to Atul and I in both mindset and personality. They are a large logistics and warehousing developer and manager in the US. We have a great relationship with them,” explains Sain. The IndoSpace platform has so far raised $584 million across two funds to invest in building logistics parks. These include the IndoSpace Logistics Park I, raised in 2009 with a corpus of $240 million, and IndoSpace Logistics Park II, raised in 2014 with a corpus of $344 million. Using some leverage, the total investment has been almost $1 billion. IndoSpace’s portfolio includes 17 industrial and logistics park projects under operation and development across Mumbai, Pune, the National Capital Region, Bengaluru and Chennai. Its tenants include companies such as Amazon, L’Oreal, Procter and Gamble, Nissan, PepsiCo, DHL, Leoni, Steelcase, Kubota, Ericsson, Bosch, Delphi, Caterpillar, Adidas and Asian Paints. IndoSpace plans to invest an additional $1 billion in the country over the next five years. The additional investment will increase its development pipeline from around 20 million sq. ft currently to 50 million sq. ft. Sain explains: “Something that is very unique about Everstone is that we buy land, we get permissions, we design, construct, facility manage, lease, asset manage, finance—all in-house. We probably have as much if not more capability than most real estate developers in India. “So, at worst, we are a fully integrated real estate developer. At best, we are a little bit more than that because we are also a fund manager. “But any which way you look at it, the Everstone Group will be among the top five real estate developer groups in the country and one of the few truly national developers given the number of cities in which we operate,” he adds. Sain cites growth in consumption and e-commerce, and the unlocking of great manufacturing potential through government programmes such as Make in India, and removing the flux around the goods and services tax (GST) as reasons for its aggressive investment plans in the logistics space. "Something that is very unique about Everstone is that we buy land, we get permissions, we design, construct, facility manage, lease, asset manage, finance—all in-house"- Sameer Sain on Everstone’s real estate strategy He says: “When people hear of other real estate developers, they talk in awe, but not many people talk about us. We keep a low profile and industrial real estate is hardly a talking point. No one goes to Chakan and says, Wow! Look at this 3 million sq. ft industrial development, whereas you can see a 100,000 sq. ft building in Lower Parel and get all excited about it and that builder gets a lot more prominence. “But we are not here for prominence, we are here to make money for our investors. We are present in 17 cities—from Lucknow and Kochi where we have built malls to Chennai (Oragadum and Sriperumbudur) and Pune (Chakan) where we have developed large logistics facilities. “We are a national developer. We do everything in-house and we have no capital constraints. When you pay fees to a typical real estate fund manager, what they do is go and back other real estate developers with investor capital. So the developer has to make money, the fund manager has to make money and then the investor eventually gets the remainder. With us, the end investor benefits dramatically as we are an integrated developer and fund manager,” he says. In the credit business, the group has taken a slightly different approach. Rather than create a credit fund, given their experience with credit at Goldman Sachs, and the fact that they created Future Capital from scratch, they decided to do it in a non-banking financial company (NBFC) format. Sain recalls: “Four-and-a-half years ago, we capitalized a company from zero to about $200 million. We, along with some of our investors put in approximately $120 million and we brought in some partners like Goldman Sachs and Ashmore. We put in a great management team, and added all our experience, risk systems and credit processes. "The Everstone Group will be among the top five real estate developer groups in the country and one of the few truly national developers given the number of cities in which we operate"- Sameer Sain on Everstone’s real estate business “We started IndoStar with complex corporate lending and today that business segment accounts for over 60% of our Rs6,000 crore book. The rest comes from real estate and SME (small and medium enterprise) lending. The NBFC is looking to increase the SME book to Rs1,500 crore this year from around Rs400 crore last year. Since its launch in 2010, the NBFC’s loan book has grown at an average annual pace of 50%. “For the financial year 2015-16, the NBFC’s revenue increased 22% to Rs644 crore from Rs528 crore in the previous year. In 2015-16, it reported a net profit growth of 29% at Rs192 crore. Its net non-performing asset ratio was at 0.2%. “We started the SME business recently and it has gotten off to a good start. We also recently got our housing finance approvals and are about to embark on secured retail lending. Our real asset always remains our talent. That has always been the key to our success,” explains Sain. Everstone’s fourth business and one which is less known is its early-stage venture capital business. “It is a specialist business; it has a lot of art in it. In early-stage venture capital, because there is so much art and because the deal sizes are very small, we have adopted a slightly different approach,” says Sain. He explains: “We have formed an equal joint venture with Deepak Shahdadpuri, who we believe is the number one consumer venture capital investor, not just in India but also in South-East Asia. His track record is spectacular and we trust him 100%. Deepak runs DSG Consumer Partners with total independence but he has the entire Everstone ecosystem and platform at his disposal. “It is very unusual to have such a small fund (first fund was $22 million of which $4 million was Deepak’s and our capital) and be able to even afford decent office space and a team. But Deepak has five offices, a lot of talent, full infrastructure, total support so he can do what he does best—make great investments and nurture his young companies. For the investors in such a small fund this is an amazing proposition. Huge skin in the game with such a significant investment from the managers, a large stable platform, yet the art and nimbleness of an early-stage venture fund. Once again, a Ferrari for the price of a Fiat!” he adds. "We have formed an equal joint venture with Deepak Shahdadpuri, who we believe is the number one consumer venture capital investor, not just in India but also in South-East Asia. His track record is spectacular and we trust him 100%"- Sameer Sain on Everstone Group’s early-stage venture capital business According to Sain, their early-stage thesis has worked out really well. They are among the earliest investors in companies like Oyo, Mswipe, Veeba and Indialends. Over 70% of invested capital has been realized after just one whole and one partial exit. The fund is on track to deliver strong returns. “That fund is on track to deliver a five-seven times multiple of capital in a relatively short period of time,” he says. The early-stage fund is now about to sell stake in three companies at huge markups. “We are about to sell a small stake in three companies—at 17-18x.” It is also out to raise its second fund which is about to close soon. “We are oversubscribed because we don’t want to raise too much money. Out of the $35-40 million, about $5 million is partner commitment between us and Deepak,” says Sain. After giving us a clear road map on where each of these businesses is headed, Sain talks about what worries him the most: Perception. Perception about Everstone being great at fundraising and not so good at exits and investment. “This is simply not true. We are the only RE (real estate) fund from 2006 that has liquidated all its investments and returned capital to LPs,” insists Sain. "Don’t think of us as a traditional PE player. We are probably among India’s top restaurateurs, we are one of the largest real estate developers, etc."- Sameer Sain He admits that they are behind schedule on exiting from their first PE fund, but assures that they will be accelerating their pace. “We have sold around 35% of our positions, we should be at about 70%,”he says. Sain then starts giving us an overview of exit plans and the time frame for that. “There is a time to sell businesses. For example, we wanted to ensure that in a company like Centrum (Capital), we had strong leadership and management. With Jaspal Bindra showing up and putting his own capital into the business, we are confident that Centrum will go to a new level,” he says. Selling for the sake of selling is not on. Sain points out: “We have time. Over time we will sell our stake and we want to leave the businesses stable and in good hands. “VLCC has filed for an IPO (initial public offering) and that business has performed well for us despite the fact that most of its peers have blown up. It’s the clear market leader with a strong new CEO in place. McKinsey recently conducted a full strategic review and the company is in the midst of implementing the suggestions. “We have a few businesses that are behind but we will find a way and exit them,” says Sain. For him, Everstone Capital Management has gone beyond PE. It’s almost akin to an e-commerce company where technology is the underlying enabler. PE just serves as a conduit for it to achieve its ambitions of owning and building food businesses, real estate parks, industrial warehouses and so on. “Don’t think of us as a traditional private equity player. We are probably among India’s top restaurateurs, we are one of the largest real estate developers, we are among the top 10 financial services houses, we are the top educational publisher, etc. We look at our platforms and businesses through a competitive and strong operational lens,” says Sain. What also helps them achieve such goals is that their capital is flexible. For Sain, Everstone Capital Management has gone beyond PE. It’s almost akin to an e-commerce firm where technology is the underlying enabler Sain says: “We are not a sole India-focused fund where every company we buy must be in India. We have a lot of flexibility in our strategy and look for businesses which can benefit from a nexus with India and South-East Asia. Buying a business in the US and bringing the back-end to India is as exciting for us as buying a business in India and then exporting its goods or services to the US. “In our first fund we bought Faces, a Canadian colour cosmetics brand. Many years later, the brand is called Faces Canada, but India is its largest market. We also own a majority of Burger King and Domino’s in Indonesia and Harry’s in Singapore but a lot of the procurement decisions or which beverage partner we think is best are all centralized and synergized,” he adds. With over $3.3 billion in equity investments and a lot more using debt, Sain’s firm is also a significant foreign direct investment contributor to the country. “The business environment has improved a lot for us and we feel it at the ground level, especially in terms of business ease and local governments wanting to do the right things. In terms of our interactions with state and central governments, there is a keenness to bring in long-term stable foreign capital. And, of course, as the largest player in warehousing and logistics facilities, GST is going to be a big positive for us,” he says. "I expect us to be even more aggressive in terms investing over the next five years, much more aggressive than what we have been in the previous five years"- Sameer Sain on Everstone Group’s strategy going ahead “Talking purely economically, this government is doing a great job. That gives us the confidence to continue to deploy larger and larger pools of capital. I expect us to be even more aggressive in terms investing over the next five years, much more aggressive than what we have been in the previous five years,” says Sain. What next? “More of the same,” he adds.

So they tried a new idea. Student Ideas Group members Gi Gi Strollo, left, Candance Otten and Charles Johnson talk about their e-commerce project to raise money for Rock Hill schools. Jennifer Becknell jbecknell@heraldonline.com Members of the Student Ideas Group designed T-shirts and came up with other products to sell in an online venture to raise money for Rock Hill schools. Jennifer Becknell jbecknell@heraldonline.com 1 of 2 i By Jennifer Becknell jbecknell@heraldonline.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story ROCK HILL Door-to-door sales of cookie dough and wrapping paper are a tough way to raise money. So the members of a Rock Hill Student Ideas Group dreamed up a better way. The group of about two dozen students from Rock Hill’s three high schools, based at the Applied Technology Center, have spent three years laying the groundwork. Now they’re ready to launch a project they hope could raise thousands for Rock Hill schools. The student group, which has been learning about e-commerce, researching products and marketing their ideas, has created two websites. They plan to use the sites to sell clothing and unique products to benefit schools in the Rock Hill district. “It hit me like a rock,” said retired York County businessman Charles Johnson, now a volunteer adult leader of the Applied Technology Center group. “This is the way to do fundraising.” Customers can order and pay for their items online, using credit cards, so students don’t have to handle the money, he said. And the items are shipped directly to the customer, so students don’t have to handle the delivery. Eighty percent of the profit from each purchase will go back to Rock Hill schools, he said, and buyers can choose one or more schools they want the purchase to benefit. The remaining 20 percent of the profit goes to pay student interns who are leading the project and other expenses, including a Rock Hill packing company that is handling orders. Students say the project has been an eye-opening experience in what it’s really like to run a small business. “Now I have the tools to start my own business, and I think it’s something I would like to look into,” said South Pointe High senior Chase Starnes, 17. Spencer Simon, 16, a Rock Hill High student, got involved in the project because of his interest in using social media. But he’s learned so much about marketing, distribution and other facets of a business that now he’d like to be an entrepreneur. Northwestern High sophomore Helena Hubbard, 15, learned about teamwork and communication. “I’ve got an idea how to work on a project in the workplace,” she said. Johnson, who spent 25 years with Proctor and Gamble as a sales and marketing manager, said the idea germinated several years ago, when he began speaking to Applied Technology Center marketing classes. Students’ ideas drove the project, he said. The students wanted to create a website to raise money for schools through sales, and they did research and surveys on what type of products they should sell. They also prepared plans to market their sites. Johnson said students ended up with two websites. One, www.baystgarment.com, will focus on ongoing sales of T-shirts and other clothing designed by students, with the aim of providing a steady stream of revenue. The second site, www.studentig.org, will have fundraisers for a scheduled period, with time in between for students to reorganize. It sells unique, needed products that are both safe and environmentally friendly, a criteria the students set. “The students have really great ideas,” said Jerry Shuler, another adult volunteer with the group. “They just need some direction.” Johnson said students did research and conducted surveys to decide which of hundreds of items should be sold on the website. They narrowed it down to 15. Some of the products include a $26.99 shoe and boot scraper, a $19.95 wall-mounted grocery bag dispenser, a $29.95 car dog harness and a $19.95 garden tool organizer. Buyers can also purchase gift bundles and a $16.95 food package for homeless or needy students in Rock Hill schools. The group doesn’t get a profit from the food package, Johnson said. Starnes said part of the goal of the project is to find ways to give back to the community. The group hopes the money it raises can be used to supplement the financial support for school organizations and parent-teacher groups. Students have recently begun marketing the idea with 200 signs set up across Rock Hill, and they plan to distribute 500 posters in restaurants and retail stores. They are also doing promotions with school principals, Parent-Teacher Organization leaders and teachers. Shuler said the group doesn’t yet know how much money it might generate, but there’s lots of potential. If the group sells 2,000 T-shirts – about one to each student at either Rock Hill or Northwestern high schools – that would generate around $16,000 to donate to Rock Hill schools, he said. Johnson said the idea has potential to benefit other school districts and other nonprofit groups, such as churches. As one student, Kennedy Reed said, it could “make an impact on the world.” Jennifer Becknell: 803-329-4077 More information A Rock Hill Student Ideas Group has launched two websites to sell clothing and other items, with profits to benefit Rock Hill schools. The sites are: ▪  www.baystgarment.com: sells T-shirts and other clothing items designed by Rock Hill students ▪  www.studentig.org: sells items that are environmentally friendly or help with safety; buyers can also purchase a $16.95 food pack for a needy Rock Hill student Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Education Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 1:34 Family, guests react to new Fort Mill video series Pause 3:30 Video: old rivals Northwestern and Gaffney meet in first round of 5A football playoffs 0:58 Woman accused of burying dead baby in Rock Hill yard talks to judge 1:05 Video: Duby Okeke compares Winthrop men's basketball teammates to Space Jam characters 2:46 Video: breaking down the York-Daniel 4A football playoffs first round matchup 0:42 Video: what does Chester coach Victor Floyd think about Cyclones' return to football playoffs? 0:41 Panthers Kurt Coleman: Luke Kuechly told us to keep fighting 0:57 Panthers LB Luke Kuechly taken off field in cart 1:06 Trump supporters at Fletcher, NC rally 0:58 Drug combo shuts down a type of lung cancer, researchers find Share Video Video link: Select Embed code: Select facebook twitter email 2 months ago Winthrop students in Rock Hill feel sadness, rage over shootings 4:00 2 months ago Winthrop students in Rock Hill feel sadness, rage over shootings 0:35 3 months ago Rock Hill students practice football drills Panthers-style 0:48 3 months ago Rock Hill school opens Ben Carson Reading Room View more video Education Winthrop display depicting lynching of blacks meant to create ‘aesthetic dialogue,’ group says Bethel students first to jump in for school swim lessons Winthrop’s founding president DB Johnson named to SC Hall of Fame Winthrop groundskeeper who died at 35 ‘never met a stranger’ Winthrop OKs merging 2 special education focuses to make students more marketable Editor's Choice Videos Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Home Delivery E-Edition Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Newspapers in Education Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Mobile Advertising Advertising Information Place Obituary, Celebration Place Classified, Legal Find&Save Local Shopping Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service Subscriptions Digital Subscriptions Home Delivery E-Edition Site Information Customer Service About Us Contact Us Newspapers in Education Social, Mobile & More Facebook Twitter YouTube Google+ Mobile Advertising Advertising Information Place Obituary, Celebration Place Classified, Legal Find&Save Local Shopping More Copyright Commenting Policy Privacy Policy Terms of Service

Here&rsquo;s how to play it</p> <p>Jim Cramer plugged into the video game space and highlighted which gaming stocks investors should be playing right now.</p> Cramer Remix: The video game space is on fire. Here’s how to play it    Monday, 17 Oct 2016 | 7:00 PM ET | 01:34 Right now there is practically no other theme hotter than video games, Jim Cramer says. Restaurants and retailers have all reported that it has become very hard to entice consumers into their locations. This is just further evidence that people just want to stay home, watch TV, use social media and play games these days. "The video game space is on fire and you've got a ton of ways to play it," the "Mad Money" host said. For those who think games are only for kids, the numbers prove otherwise. Industry-trade group Entertainment Software Association reported that 63 percent of all U.S. households have at least one person who plays video games regularly, with the average gamer 35-years-old. Additionally, consumers spent $23.5 billion on gaming hardware, software and accessories last year. The biggest problem in the video game space is that there are so many options to invest in, Cramer said. Cramer's top picks were NVIDIA or Advanced Micro Devices for components, and Electronic Arts, Activision Blizzard or Take-Two Interactive for games, depending on an investor's risk profile. "The key takeaway … this is not a niche business, it is a mass entertainment business and it's growing — not shrinking — despite what older people might think," Cramer said. Jonathan Ernst | Reuters Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton at their first debate at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, Sept. 26, 2016. Cramer sees many reasons not to own stocks right now, as many investors believe that the future of the U.S. will be much worse than the past. "I am not making any kind of statement about the election in November. But I do think that the rancorous nature of the debate is putting a lid on stocks," he said. The world of investing has transformed into one where a tweet by Sen. Bernie Sanders has the power take down the entire drug group. Investors simply don't want to own the stocks anymore. They also don't want to own companies with international exposure when international trade is under the microscope from Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton wants to raise some taxes, Cramer said. Cramer also noted that the election year could drive the unpopularity of the group, and banks remain unpopular in Washington. He expects to see more regulation ahead in the wake of Wells Fargo's sales scandal. Bank of America reported on Monday that it earned a whopping $1.8 billion in consumer banking, with strong deposit growth that drove net interest income higher amid a decline in expenses. The stock quickly popped and then surrendered most of its gains on Monday. The stock basically did nothing. Abigail Stevenson | CNBC Sylvia Acevedo, Interim CEO of Girl Scouts Nutanix is the enterprise cloud software play that came public with a bang three weeks ago, and then fell more than 7 percent on Monday. From the start, investors pegged Nutanix as the best performing IPO of 2016, as it came public at $16 and spiked to $37 by the close on Sept. 30. Cramer isn't a fan, though. While Nutanix has a compelling concept and fantastic numbers, the problem is that the IPO was what Cramer calls a "sliver deal." That is when a company comes public, but sells just a tiny sliver of stock. This can cause an enormous spike out of the gate because demand outweighs supply for the stock. "I hate sliver deals. I hate them because they are setting you up for failure," Cramer said. Once the lockup expires in a few months, Cramer expects Nutanix to do a secondary offering. That will cause the supply of the stock to outstrip the demand, and the share price will likely get clobbered. Sylvia Acevedo, interim CEO of Girl Scouts, launched her first rocket into the clear skies of New Mexico when she was just a child to earn her science badge in Girl Scouts. That experience triggered a lifelong passion for science, and led her to earn an MBA in engineering from Stanford and become a rocket scientist. She is also the White House commissioner on the presidential initiative for Hispanic educational excellence. In an interview with Cramer, she said she aims for Girl Scouts to not only instill the mission of leadership into girls, but to become more technology-focused and teach how to code. "It is part of our culture to do technology, to learn how to code, to have hands on projects — whether it's creating fashionable wearables, or creating robots," Acevedo said. In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few caller favorite stocks: Procter & Gamble: "I like Procter. I'd like you to buy it a little bit cheaper, because I think it can come down to $84 or $85. But I think it's a good choice." Synchrony Financial: "That thing has come down too much. That's kind of attractive to me ... You know what's more attractive? If Visa sells off a couple of bucks. My charitable trust owns it. I think that Charlie Scharf [outgoing CEO] has got some personal things he has to attend to at home in New York, and that stock is coming down and that may be a better opportunity."
