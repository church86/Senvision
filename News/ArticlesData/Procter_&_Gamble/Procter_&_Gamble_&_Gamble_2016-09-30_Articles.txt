In the transaction, P&G transferred the assets and liabilities of P&G Specialty Beauty Brands, other than specified excluded brands, to Galleria Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of P&G created to facilitate the transaction, and Galleria Co. will merge with a subsidiary of Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY) and become a wholly owned subsidiary of Coty. Upon completion of the merger, each share of Galleria Co. common stock will be converted into the right to receive one share of Coty class A common stock. The exchange offer expired at 12:00 midnight, Eastern Daylight (New York City) Time, on September 29, 2016. P&G shareholders who tendered their shares of P&G common stock in the exchange offer will receive approximately 3.9033 shares of Coty class A common stock (subject to receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares) for each share of P&G common stock accepted for exchange. Exchange Offer Preliminary Results Pursuant to the exchange offer and based on a preliminary count by the exchange agent, approximately 691,105,648 shares of P&G common stock were tendered prior to the expiration of the exchange offer, including 383,204,614 shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures. The total number of shares tendered includes an estimated 1,488,679 shares of P&G common stock tendered by odd-lot shareholders not subject to proration. P&G intends to accept 104,969,205 of the tendered shares in exchange for the 409,726,299 shares of Galleria Co. common stock owned by P&G and offered for exchange. Based on the total number of shares of P&G common stock reported to be tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the exchange offer, the exchange offer was oversubscribed by approximately 586,136,443 shares, including shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures, resulting in a preliminary proration factor of approximately 15.01 percent. P&G will not be able to determine the final proration factor until the end of the exchange offer's guaranteed delivery period at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 4, 2016. P&G will publicly announce the final proration factor, which may be different from today's preliminary estimate, once it has been determined. Because more than 104,969,205 shares of P&G common stock were tendered, all shares of Galleria Co. common stock owned by P&G are expected to be distributed to P&G shareholders who tendered their shares of P&G common stock in the exchange offer, and no shares of Galleria Co. common stock are expected to be distributed to P&G shareholders as a pro rata dividend. For more information about the proposed transaction, please visit the website that P&G maintains for the exchange offer at www.dfking.com/pg.

Huff, staff writer Tags: feminine hygiene products, toxic chemicals, women''s health (NaturalNews) A women's advocacy group fighting to eliminate toxic chemicals from consumer products and the environment has published a new report highlighting the dangers associated with many feminine hygiene and personal care products. Entitled "Chem Fatale," the paper by Women's Voices for the Earth (WVE) addresses the many toxic chemicals still being used in feminine products like tampons and deodorants, which expose women to a host of chemicals linked to endocrine disruption, reproductive problems and cancer. The report specifically targets the consumer giant Procterr & Gamble (P&G), which manufactures Tampax and Always, two of the most popular feminine care product brands in North America. According to a press release announcing the new paper, WVE's goal is to raise awareness about the dangers of the chemicals found in these products, and to push major corporations like P&G to remove them, or at the very least start labeling them. "Feminine care products are not just your average cosmetics because they are used on an exceptionally sensitive and absorbent part of a woman's body," said Alexandra Scranton, director of science and research at WVE and author of the new report. "Greater scrutiny, oversight and research are badly needed to assure the safety of their ingredients on women's health." Tampons, pads regulated as 'medical devices'; ingredient disclosure optional Of particular concern to the group are tampons and feminine pads, both of which are currently regulated as "medical devices" by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Since these two product classes are not considered under the law to be cosmetic in nature, manufacturers are not required to disclose their ingredients on packaging -- and not surprisingly, most of them don't! "Current regulations on chemicals used in feminine care products are not sufficient to protect public health, and often don't require the ingredient disclosure needed to assess safety," explains WVE. "Tampons and pads are regulated as medical devices, which means that companies are not required to disclose any ingredients in these products." But WVE hopes to change this by drawing attention to the sensitive nature of the areas on women's bodies where these products are typically used. According to the group, conventional tampons and pads may contain chemicals like dioxins and pesticide residues, which can cause cancer, as well as hormone disruptors like parabens -- parabens have also been shown to cause cancer -- that are much more easily absorbed by vaginal tissue than by regular skin. "Ingredients are determined 'safe,' operating under the premise that they are used on ordinary skin just like other cosmetic products," reads the report. "That means chemicals of concern such as carcinogens, reproductive toxins, endocrine disruptors, and allergens are being used on, or even in, the extremely permeable mucus membranes of the vaginal area." Mystery 'fragrance' ingredients in feminine care products also a health hazard Many feminine care products designated as "cosmetics" are also problematic, as they contain all sorts of added chemicals including "fragrance" ingredients, which as we previously reported do not have to be individually labeled, because they are protected under current law as "trade secrets." "Unfortunately, a 'fragrance' is a mixture of ingredients that can include any of over 3,000 different chemicals; and the components of any one fragrance are usually kept secret by manufacturers," explains the report. "According to a master list of fragrance chemicals made available by the International Fragrance Association, fragrances can include chemicals which are carcinogens, irritants, allergens, and potential endocrine disruptors." Nearly every category of feminine care product, from tampons and pads to wipes, washes, deodorants, anti-itch creams and douches, contains added fragrances, which is why WVE is urging women everywhere to avoid all fragranced products. The group is also concerned about the use of chemicals like methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone, two preservatives linked to causing contact dermatitis. Data reveal high levels of pesticides in tampons One category of toxins that the average woman would likely never expect in her feminine care products is pesticides, and yet independent, third-party-certified testing conducted by the group Naturally Savvy back in 2013 revealed that at least one major tampon brand contains up to nine different pesticides varieties. According to the study, the following residues were observed: • Malathion and malaoxon (metabolite): 1 ppm (parts per million) • Dichlofluanid: 1 ppm • Mecarbam: 6 ppm • Procymidone: 37 ppm • Methidathion: 5 ppm • Fensulfothion: 5 ppm • Pyrethrum: 66 ppm • Piperonyl butoxide: 1 ppm Though these levels are all below the maximum allowable threshold for pesticides in food, they do not meet the FDA's guidelines for tampons, which should be "free of pesticide residue." Additionally, the Pesticide Action Network lists malathion, malaoxon, mecarbam, procymidone, methidathion, fensulfothion and pyrethrum as possible endocrine disruptors, while the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists piperonyl butoxide as a "possible human carcinogen," with malathion "suggestive of carcinogenicity." "Vulvar and vaginal tissue are structurally different than the skin of the rest of the body," reads a commentary published by Organic Slant. "That means this area of the body is potentially more vulnerable to exposure to toxic chemicals and irritants." Stop using conventional feminine care products and switch to natural alternatives WVE suggests that women not only switch to safer, cleaner alternatives such as unscented, chlorine-free, unbleached tampons and pads but possibly even reduce their overall use of feminine care products. In its report, the group cites recommendations from the American Public Health Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists against intra-vaginal cleaning (douching) and using most feminine sprays and powders, which are loaded with additives and chemicals. "Reduce your use of feminine care products... [and] eliminate use of products that may be unnecessary to a healthy vagina," advises WVE. Also, women should choose "unscented products where available (particularly tampons and pads)... [and] [l]ook for brands that disclose all ingredients, including fragrance ingredients."

(Photo: John Minchillo, AP) CINCINNATI -- Demand has exceeded supply in Procter & Gamble's tender offer to swap P&G shares for an eventual stake in New York beauty company Coty. The disclosure made Friday means P&G will be able to complete its split off from 41 beauty brands without spinning off any ownership to P&G shareholders that didn't participate in the stock swap. P&G shares hit a new 52-week high on Friday climbing 2.3% to $90.22 in trading at midday Friday. P&G shareholders offered more than six times as many shares needed to complete the transaction. To execute the split off, P&G needed shareholders to tender almost 105 million shares of P&G stock. Instead, P&G shareholders offered to tender more than 691 million shares. P&G, based in Cincinnati, will give small investors, tendering a total of nearly 1.5 million shares in odd-lots (less than 100 shares apiece), their full requested orders. Remaining shareholders will get roughly 15 percent of their order filled. A final proration will be determined on 5. p.m. ET Tuesday. P&G shareholders participating in the deal have agreed to swap 1 share of P&G stock for 3.9 shares of stock that will quickly convert into shares of Coty, which makes Rimmel makeup and Calvin Klein perfume. P&G priced the offer attractively, offering a 7.5% discount on shares that would convert to Coty stock to ensure interest in the transaction. After the split off occurs, shareholders of the new entity, Galleria Co. will see the new company merge immediately with Coty. The merger is expected to happen next week. Participating P&G shareholders will collectively own 54 percent of the new super-sized Coty, which will have 746 million shares outstanding and a market capitalization of about $19 billion. Coty will acquire eight P&G factories, 10,000 new workers, assume about $2 billion in debt and a raft of household names. P&G brands in the deal include: CoverGirl and Max Factor makeup, Wella and Clairol hair color and licensed  fragrances Hugo Boss, Lacoste and Gucci. With the closing of the beauty divestiture, P&G will complete its massive brand divestiture announced two years ago aimed at paring 100 noncore labels. When the deal is done, P&G executives have promised their company will be smaller, easier-to-run and poised to resume growing sales and profits. The completed tender offer will also have functioned as a massive share repurchase with P&G shrinking its outstanding shares by about 4% – enhancing the earnings per share and value of remaining shares. 360 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2dt0BoX

Fox Lloyd Roitstein Pamela Bartling Buffett Rick Chudacoff Dr. E. Terence Foster William Baird Robert Goldstein Clarence Wigington Omaha Central Hall of Fame to add 10 names From staff reports Oct 1, 2016 (…) Omaha Central High School will induct 10 people into its Hall of Fame on Thursday, Oct. 6. A 6:30 p.m. dinner in the school’s courtyard will precede the 7:30 p.m. induction ceremony at the school. Tickets are $50 a person or $400 for a table of eight, and are available from the Central High Foundation office, 402-556-1996. These people are being inducted this year into Central’s Hall of Fame: +9  William Baird William Baird (Class of 1930): Baird’s career in law was long and distinguished; his name lives on in one of Nebraska’s largest and most prestigious law firms. Baird’s roots at both Central and in the Omaha law community ran deep. His great aunt was an early principal at then-Omaha High and the first female high school principal in Nebraska. And both his grandfathers had law practices in Omaha that dated to the 1880s. After graduating from law school in 1937, Baird joined his father in a law firm that became known as Baird and Baird. He moved on to larger firms before in 1970 becoming the co-architect of a merger that created the BairdHolm firm. He served for years as legal counsel to the Westside School District, a legacy in education that continues at the firm. During his 44-year career, he received the Nebraska State Bar Association’s award of special merit and served on the bar’s ethics and discipline committee and chief justice nominating commission. Baird also served as president of the Nebraska Bar Association. Baird interrupted his law career to serve his country during World War II, commanding naval gun crews on troop escort vessels in the Atlantic. Since his 1981 death, his name has continued to stand in Nebraska for the highest standards in the legal profession. +9  Pamela Bartling Buffett Pamela Bartling Buffett (Class of 1960): Buffett is a passionate advocate and supporter of a variety of causes. Motivated by a deep connection to serving mankind, Pamela is particularly drawn to social justice organizations, scholarships that connect students to an education, and improving the quality of life for people with special needs. During her time as a student, Pamela was grateful for Central High School’s commitment to connecting and embracing a variety of cultures to build a diverse community. Being immersed in CHS’s actively inclusive environment gave Pamela the lifetime gift of a deep respect for humanity that has greatly influenced the mission and purpose of her philanthropy. Pamela and her late husband, Fred Buffett, started the Rebecca Susan Buffett Foundation in memory of their daughter. The Rebecca Susan Buffett Foundation supports many organizations that serve people with mental illnesses, provides scholarships for higher education and serves underprivileged children through the Northstar Foundation and Girls Inc. in Omaha. Pamela’s most recent charitable endeavor is the Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center. Another role Pamela feels blessed to have in her life is being the mother to her daughter Sarah. With a resilient heart and compelling vision, Pamela remains steadfast during times of either success or sadness, both outcomes that she has experienced in her life. Most of all, she finds continuous inspiration, gratitude, and joy in seeing her support empower the many lives she has touched, discovering that giving to others was truly a gift within itself. +9  Rick Chudacoff Rick Chudacoff (Class of 1967): In the world of songwriting and music production, few can claim the kind of cross-genre success achieved by Rick Chudacoff. Chudacoff helped to pen or produce top-selling hits in pop, R&B, Christian and country, including co-writing the 1995 Grammy-winning “Somewhere in the Vicinity of the Heart.” He first broke into the music business playing with the major label disco funk band Crackin’. He made his first big mark as a songwriter/arranger by collaborating on Robbie Dupree’s “Steal Away,” a catchy hit that reached No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1980. He then received production credits on Matthew Wilder’s 1983 pop standard “Break My Stride,” which hit No. 5 on the Hot 100, and Patti LaBelle’s 1984 R&B hit “New Attitude,” among others. In his varied career, he has co-written top 10 hits in pop (“Steal Away”), R&B (The Temptations’ “Look What You Started,” No. 8 in 1986), contemporary Christian (“I Call Your Name,” Clay Crosse, No. 1 in 1994) and country (Shenandoah’s “Somewhere in the Vicinity of the Heart,” No. 7 in 1995). In all, productions on which he’s been involved account for more than 25 million units sold. Through his own music company, Gouda Music Group, he continues to write and produce music in a number of genres. +9  Dr. E. Terence Foster Dr. E. Terence Foster (Class of 1959): A University of Nebraska-Lincoln colleague once referred to Foster as “a kind of engineering wizard,” citing his knowledge of the field as well as his grasp of its mathematical, physical and scientific underpinnings. That depth of knowledge certainly served Foster well as he built an outstanding career that bridged both engineering practice and education. President of his senior class at Central, Foster earned bachelors and masters degrees from MIT before completing his doctorate in structural engineering from Cal-Berkeley. He served two years as an officer in the Vietnam era U.S. military, working at the Pentagon and in The Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Foster returned to Omaha in 1970 to work with an engineering technology subsidiary of HDR and later served as a vice president for technology at Union Pacific before joining the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s engineering faculty in 1991. He founded the university’s construction engineering degree program and became associate director of the Durham School of Architectural Engineering. In 2014, he was honored with the Engineering Education Excellence Award by the National Society of Professional Engineers, awarded annually to recognize faculty who have linked engineering education with professional practice. It was a fitting cap to a career devoted to both. +9  Donald T. Fox Donald T. Fox (Class of 1947): “Worldly” hardly begins to describe Donald Fox, whose ability to navigate the ins and outs of international law helped him found a prominent international law firm in New York City and to work to promote human rights throughout the world. After graduating from Harvard (1951), and NYU Law School (1956), Fox attended the University of Paris as a Fulbright Scholar, earning two more law degrees. As a litigator with a large Wall Street firm, Fox used his international experience to help U.S. clients acquire European companies and finance foreign projects. That work led to the founding of his own international law firm in 1968. He has spent decades helping foreign firms export, license technology and acquire businesses in the United States, as well as advising American firms doing business abroad. Beyond business, Fox became active in the drive to promote independent judicial systems and deter oppressive governments around the world. As chairman of the American Association for the International Commission of Jurists, he has conducted missions and written reports on human rights abuses and also evaluated national judicial systems, work that has taken him from Latin America to Hungary and Ethiopia. +9  Robert Goldstein Robert Goldstein (Class of 1955): During a visionary and pioneering advertising career, Goldstein helped turn products like Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent, Head and Shoulders shampoo and Charmin bathroom tissue into household names. Goldstein served as Procter & Gamble’s vice president of advertising for nearly a decade before his life was tragically cut short at age 50. He served as chairman of the Association of National Advertisers and as a leader of numerous other advertising organizations. He was among the first to recognize the potential for cable television, making one of the first sizable advertising buys on CNN and TBS. Goldstein was also very active in Cincinnati’s Jewish community. Goldstein’s life and career came to a sudden close in 1987 in a rafting accident in British Columbia. He was mourned by Procter & Gamble’s CEO as a man whose impact on advertising was great, not due to the dollars he commanded but his high standards and principles. In 1988, he was elected to the National Advertising Hall of Fame. +9  Aubray Woods Orduna Aubray Woods Orduna (Class of 1965): Orduna for more than four decades has displayed her commitment to the nursing profession, from caring bedside to served as the longtime dean of nursing at Omaha’s Clarkson College. After graduating from the nursing school at Murray State University in Kentucky in 1970, she practiced briefly in Pittsburgh before returning to her native Omaha in 1975 to serve as a unit nurse at Clarkson Hospital. Her skills and leadership abilities were quickly recognized. She soon after became the assistant head nurse in the unit and by 1979 was named a nursing instructor at Clarkson College. In 1989, she returned to the hospital in an administrative role, by 1995 rising to director of evaluation and case management. She then returned to the college in 2000 as director of diversity services, developing and she implemented a strategic plan to meet the college’s diversity goals and mentor 50 minority students for the Clarkson College Gateway to Success Scholarship program to become BSN prepared nurses. From there, she climbed into the college’s top leadership positions, first directing the practical nursing program and then all undergraduate nursing programs before being named dean of nursing in October of 2009 — a position she still holds. Orduna has also served as president of the Omaha Black Nurses’ Association since 2005 and has received numerous awards, including a positive image of nursing award from the Nebraska Nurses Association, Clarkson’s Caring Kind Award and a volunteer of the year award from the Kidney Foundation of Nebraska. +9  Lloyd Roitstein Lloyd Roitstein (Class of 1964): Service to others is part of the Boy Scout Oath, and Lloyd Roitstein certainly took that to heart. Roitstein has been in scouting for 62 years, as a Boy Scout, volunteer leader, and 40 years as a professional scouter, including two decades leading the three-state Mid-America Council headquartered in Omaha. He joined scouting at age eight and achieved scouting’s highest rank of Eagle Scout, remaining active while attending Central. Roitstein started his career in 1971 in Omaha and advanced his career here until being promoted to Scout Executive in Illinois in 1984 and the National Staff in 1988 and then returning to Omaha in 1992 was named president/scout executive of the Mid-America Council. In 2010, the Council was recognized as No. 1 in the Boy Scouts of America. Roitstein’s leadership was tested in June 2008 when a tornado struck Little Sioux Scout Ranch in Iowa killing four scouts and injuring nearly 50. Under his leadership, he led a team of volunteers who responded to all facets of the tragedy. Months later, he led the scouts along with their parents and leaders who were involved in this tragedy to the White House to meet with President George W. Bush. Before he retired in 2011, Roitstein was awarded the Distinguished Executive Award by the Boy Scouts of America. +9  Benjamin Wiesman Benjamin Wiesman (Class of 1949): Omaha’s long tradition as a telephone call center can be traced to the work of Ben Wiesman, one of many ways the real estate developer helped build his native city. Six years after graduating from Central, Wiesman founded his first real estate company. By the late 1960s, he expanded from apartment development into commercial real estate. He became an innovator in the concept of “build and lease,” building and furnishing new structures to the specifications of businesses and leasing them back as the property manager. After developing with Whirlpool Corp. the first worldwide 800 calling system at its headquarters in Michigan, he believed Omaha’s central location would make it an ideal location for toll-free call centers. He subsequently built the nation’s first building designed specifically for telephone and computer operations (Ramada and Best Western Hotels), and proceeded to develop facilities for numerous hotel, car rental and telecommunications firms. Some of his work has been preservation and renovation of historic buildings downtown, including the Flatiron Building and Ford Plaza Building. For his efforts, Downtown Omaha Inc. presented him with its Visionary Pioneer Award. +9  Clarence Wigington Clarence Wigington (Class of 1902): Wigington left his mark both on Omaha and his adopted home of St. Paul, Minnesota, as one of the Midwest’s first African-American architects. By the time Wigington enrolled at Central in 1898, he won three first-place drawing certificates during the 1898 Trans-Mississippi Exposition in Omaha. Subsequently graduating in 1902, he worked for notable Omaha architect Thomas Kimball, becoming the city’s first African-American architect. After quickly promoted to junior draftsman, he started his own firm in 1908. Local credits include an addition to St. John’s AME Church, the rebuilding of Zion Baptist Church after the city’s 1913 tornado and the Bloomfield and Crutchfield Apartments — now on the National Register of Historic Places. He later moved his family to St. Paul and served for 35 years in the city architect’s office. The Pavilion on Harriet Island in St. Paul—one of three buildings he designed now on the national register — was renamed in 1998 Clarence W. Wigington Pavilion. Wigington designed ice palaces for St. Paul’s annual Winter Carnival. Becoming active in civil rights, he helped to create and served as president of the St. Paul Urban League. He died in 1967, but his legacy lives on in many of his surviving structures. Tags Firm Thomas Kimball Donald T. Fox William Baird Tell us your good news!

Kelsey Humphreys Contributor Producer, Host, Entrepreneur, Journalist, Author September 30, 2016 Since founding the now award-winning New York-based agency MRY in his bedroom in 2002, Matt Britton has worked with some of the world’s leading brands, such as Microsoft, Coca-Cola and Visa. He has also become a leader in social media marketing and millennial marketing. Britton has spoken at industry conferences around the globe and has become a featured advertising expert for CNBC, Mashable, Forbes, The New York Times and Wall Street Journal, among others. How did he go from solo consultant to employing more than 500 people and then a multi-million-dollar exit? First, he faced failure, launching an internet marketing firm out of college that burst along with the internet bubble. Even with clients such as Sony, eBay and Evite, the firm couldn’t survive and was bailed out by Youthstream Media Networks. He stayed at Youthstream as an employee for less than two years, then took the leap again, forming Mr Youth, which later became MRY. Britton has lived out the romantic one-man-show-turned-giant-agency story. Here are his best pieces of advice for consultants and freelancer out there eager to do the same. Learn from failures. After Britton’s first failed business, he tried to absorb as much as he could while employed at Youthstream.  “I learned a lot from [Youthstream]," he says. "How to work with brick-and-mortar traditional companies, Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola -- how those companies worked, how they evaluated agencies, etc.” He also believes there is tremendous value in finding a mentor and joining groups such as Young Professional Organization, two factors he says were vital to his success. But don’t play it too safe. Like many successful entrepreneurs I’ve interviewed, Britton recommends that you build a substantial financial cushion before you take the leap. But this cushion, Britton explains, should allow you to relax about your bills, and in turn take more risks. He says you have to go all in, right from the start.  “If you’re playing scared at the beginning, you’re going to make a lot of short-term decisions, and short-term decisions come back to haunt you later on,” he says. Create a clear vision. His number-one piece of advice for brand new entrepreneurs is to do one powerful, practical vision exercise: If your business had a dream press release written about it in 10 years, and received coverage in all the major business publications, what would that release say? Write that press release. At the start, many entrepreneurs don’t know how to manage time or what tasks to tackle each day, so Britton recommends they print and display the release where they can easily see it. “Hang it up on your wall, and every day when you’re doing things, ask yourself, ‘Is what I’m doing at this moment, contributing to me getting there?’” he says. Project that vision. Britton shared that when he launched Mr Youth in 2002, he would disguise his voice when answering his phone to give the appearance of an administrative assistant who didn’t exist. At the time, his small team of freelancers was virtual, but you wouldn’t have known it looking at the company website. He was confident he could deliver, and didn’t want potential clients to feel uneasy. “When you’re in your early stages, make sure that you portray stability and portray a certain level of sophistication and prestige,” he says. Cultivate trust. Today, it is even easier to fake a great online presence. Remember that that’s not enough though. Projection only works, Britton says, if you can deliver. Cultivating relationships and building trust, he explains, were the keys to securing his first few giant clients, such as Red Bull, even though the company knew he was running a small shop. "The best way to get a disproportionate amount of business relative to the size of your organization is through relationships and trust," he says. "They knew I would run through a wall for them if I had to, and because of that, they were willing to take a chance on me.” Britton then delivered for those clients and publicized the glowing testimonials he received, which started to build a name for himself and Mr Youth. More large clients followed. Find amazing people (and let them go). Scaling from one to 500 does not happen without hiring and retaining amazing team members. How do you find them? By getting out of your existing employees’ way. From there, word of mouth takes over, and the best of the best start seeking out your firm. What about the “free agent” movement that we’re living in? Use it to your advantage, Britton says. Hire freelancers to cut down costs, especially during your slow season. Know that a lot of your best talent has a “side hustle.” Leverage those rock stars while you have them, and you may get to play a part in their future success. “Get out of [your employees’] way," he says. "The companies that are unable to scale is because the founder hug the businesses so tight that they suffocate and paralyze them.” Britton practiced what he preaches, letting a product manager at MRY experiment and eventually leave to create Crowdtap. Britton served as an advisor of the on-demand participation network, which went on to raise more than 12 million in funding and is used by more than 100 of the largest brands and marketing agencies in the U.S.  Keep up the pace. Britton noticed a distinct disconnect between C-level executives who knew that Mark Zuckerberg was smart, yet didn’t value the 20-somethings within their companies. Brands and their executives need to continually think about, and listen to, the upcoming generation. MRY exploded because Britton could discuss big business in the boardroom, but build a campaign for the streets. Today, Britton says that means building memorable, short form, micro-targeted, mobile-ready messages “designed for the flick [of one’s finger].” Be patient. One of the biggest mistakes Britton sees young founders making is going for the big money too early. Instead of trying to cash in on your first crop of ideas as soon as possible, Britton says, plant as many seeds as possible. “Too many entrepreneurs and young business people are thinking ‘how can I make money tomorrow?’" he says. "You really have to think long term and build something you believe in and stay focused on the vision and the plan and know it’s ultimately going to pay off.” Watch more videos from "The Pursuit" on the show's YouTube channel.  Related: 6 Tips to Be a Successful Solopreneur Entrepreneur Network is a premium video network providing entertainment, education and inspiration from successful entrepreneurs and thought leaders.

(Photo: The Enquirer/Anne Saker)Buy Photo The Cincinnati VA Medical Center, which has been embroiled in controversy this year over its governance and management, got its third leader this year Friday: retired Army Col. Vivian Hutson. Todd Sledge, spokesman for the Cincinnati VA Medical Center, said the announcement was supposed to happen Friday morning but got delayed. Then in late afternoon, VA Secretary Robert McDonald of Indian Hill, former chairman of Procter & Gamble, made a round of phone calls to the Ohio congressional delegation. The members of Congress immediately followed suit with statements. \“Our veterans have made countless sacrifices on our behalf, and they deserve the very best care we have to offer," Republican U.S. Sen. Rob Portman said in a release. "I’m pleased that Ms. Hutson has had significant experience in caring for and serving our men and women in uniform." Hutson, a licensed and registered dietitian, most recently worked for the U.S. Army as director of strategic outreach under the office of the surgeon general putting in place Army medicine initiatives and programs, according to her profile on LinkedIn. Before that, Army Garrison Japan Public Affairs reported that Hutson served as commander of medical and dental activity in Camp Zuma, Japan, and before that as the nutrition consultant for the Europe Regional Medical Command at Landstuhl, Germany. Fluent in Chinese, Hutson served 30 years in the Army, received a bachelor’s degree in nutritional science from Cornell University in 1986, a master’s in management and human resources development from Webster University in 1991 and a master's in healthcare administration from Baylor University in 1998, according to Sledge. Sledge said Hutson is scheduled to arrive at the hospital Monday. The direct phone calls signaled McDonald's attention to congressional concerns that the Cincinnati VA Medical Center has been in turmoil from months of leadership changes. “It’s just his way and his personal touch of doing business, instead of sending a blanket announcement through email, I think he wanted to connect with people personally,” Sledge said.The change in leadership comes as the VA's inspector general tries to figure out to how to look into complaints that UC Health and the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine regularly interfered with the operation of the Corryville facility and ousted a hospital leader for trying to set boundaries. In April, the hospital's director, who had been on the job less than a year, was sent to another VA hospital, and Glenn Costie, director of the Dayton VA, was named acting director in Cincinnati. The Cincinnati VA has a nine-story, 248-bed hospital in Corryville, a satellite facility in Fort Thomas and six clinics in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana. Nearly 45,000 veterans in the Cincinnati region get medical care through the VA. The Cincinnati facility has been in turmoil over Dr. Barbara Temeck's 2 1/2-year tenure as chief of staff of the hospital. Hospital employees complained about Temeck in an anonymous petition to McDonald. The existence of the petition was made public in February, and VA officials then demoted Temeck to a basement cubicle performing data entry while the VA inspector general looked into the petition's complaints against her. Temeck is a thoracic surgeon and a 35-year career manager at the VA. When she was removed from management, she retained Cincinnati lawyer Ken Hawley and filed a "whistleblower's" statement to the independent U.S. Office of Special Counsel detailing how she saw UC Health and the UC College of Medicine exerting undue control and influence over hospital operations. Temeck is scheduled to speak Monday to an administrative panel looking into her allegations. 62 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2dLJi6P TOP VIDEOS Are deals better on Black Friday or Cyber Monday? 1:00 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 Predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 Student at UC Tensing forum: 'It's time for war' 0:45 Sam DuBose sister: 'This, to me, is murder' 1:30 Protests in Cincinnati after Ray Tensing mistrial 1:09 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Mistrial declared in Ray Tensing case 3:46 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Enquirer Breaking News Police: 5 flee crash at I-75/I-74 junction Jennifer Baker Johnny Bench launches app to fight bullying Scott Wartman Deters: Tensing jury 'straw poll' unanimous for murder Sharon Coolidge, and Kevin Grasha Woman found dead in Boone County By Steve Beynon Joe Deters has role in medical malpractice lawsuit Kevin Grasha Report: Cincy Zoo's gorilla barrier wasn't in compliance but ....

Hidden Heroes is a groundbreaking campaign created by the Elizabeth Dole Foundation to call attention to the countries 5.5 million military and veteran caregivers. Ken-Yon Hardy/Stars and Stripes  Email  Print  Reddit  Tweet  Share  Google  More By TOM PHILPOTT | SPECIAL TO STARS AND STRIPES Published: September 29, 2016 “I was confirmed 97-to-0,” says Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Bob McDonald, recalling the Senate vote in July 2014 on his nomination to lead 360,000 VA employees and an aging infrastructure in delivering health care, disability and education benefits, and a host of other services, to millions of veterans. “And what I sensed was an appetite for, an urging for, somebody with experience transforming large organizations to do that,” adds the retired chief executive officer and board chairman of Proctor & Gamble Co. “While I have seen that, I have seen it sporadically. And right now, perhaps because of the elections upcoming, we’re seeing a hiatus in that kind of thinking.” In an hourlong interview in his office overlooking the White House, McDonald expands on the surprisingly sharp critique of Congress he delivered a week earlier while testifying on recommendations of the congressionally chartered Commission on Care. McDonald is upset to see fiscal 2016 expiring with Congress having failed to pass up to two dozen pieces of legislation he labels “essential” for continuing to transform VA to better serve veterans — with faster access to quality health care outside VA, breaking a disgraceful logjam of disability claim appeals, shelving archaic statutes that handcuff staff, and more. The enthusiasm he felt on Capitol Hill two years ago came amid a patient wait-time scandal that alarmed veterans and demoralized the Veterans Health Administration. It also spurred Congress, nearing a long election-year recess, to swiftly negotiate and pass a flawed Veterans Choice Act, hailed with false promises that would confuse and anger veterans. McDonald, a top industry executive but also a West Point graduate who graduated Army Ranger School, not only was volunteering to clean up a mess but to transform the entire department, its legacy practices and systems, into a high-performance organization that would put customers — veterans — first. The transformation is well underway, McDonald says, but it won’t progress at the speed and breadth veterans deserve unless Congress helps. VA needs legislation to streamline and consolidate six separate community-base care programs that VA still must run in addition to the Choice program. It needs authority to repair a broken claims appeal system that has veterans waiting three years for a decision; to lift unnecessary limits on physician work hours; to extend VA authorities to maintain services, such as transportation to facilities in rural areas and for vocational rehabilitation, and to fix provider agreements with long-term care facilities so the hassles of dealing with VA don’t keep enticing these facilities to turn out vets. These are highlights of a 100 proposals sent to Congress with the VA budget in February, most of which haven’t been voted on by both the House and Senate to become law, McDonald says, despite the continuous pro-veteran rhetoric heard from Republicans holding majorities in both chambers. McDonald notes that in May the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee with bipartisan support cleared an omnibus bill, the Veterans First Act, packed with reforms. Yet no floor vote has been scheduled. A senator or two, it seems, has a hold on the bill, upset over how it would be funded or over how it would keep VA in control of access to non-VA health providers. Despite that disappointment, McDonald suggests he’s work well with the Senate committee and Chairman Johnny Isakson, R-Ga. The House, meanwhile, has passed many separate veterans bills that VA doesn’t view as critical. Recently it voted for the appeals process reforms VA wants, but linked it to tougher accountability measure that the administration opposes. The disputed provisions would relax employee job protections so that, at VA alone, staff could be fired or demoted more easily for wrongdoing or poor performance than is possible in other agencies. Many bills get passed “as demonstrations of a particular ideology [without] bipartisan support,” says McDonald. “As a result, it’s all about legislative jujitsu of can you get the president to agree to something he doesn’t want to agree to, by attaching something good to it.” McDonald says he realized soon after becoming secretary that veterans’ issues, even priority reforms strongly backed by veteran service organizations, are not free these days of the bitter partisanship that has made Congresses increasingly dysfunctional. “I perceived that relatively early on,” he says, “particularly when there was this spirit of ‘gotcha!’ If you say the wrong word, the political opposition tries to exploit it in order to embarrass the administration. It wasn’t something I was familiar with in business.” His harshest critics are Republicans on the House Veterans Affairs Committee. Its chairman, Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida, led lengthy investigations into the patient wait-time scandal and launched many other examinations of VA waste, fraud and abuse since taking the committee gavel in 2011. His staff pumps out a steady stream of press releases focusing on VA corruption. Miller says McDonald failed in his promise to establish “a climate of accountability” across VA workforce despite his claims of 3,750 staff firings. McDonald doesn’t mention Miller by name in our interview, but he’s the presumed target of some pointed remarks. “You’ve got to make a decision in life,” the secretary says. “Are you always going to be pointing out problems, which is easy to do, or are you going to be part of the solution? It’s a copout to be what I call an ‘against’ leader. You know, ‘I can negotiate a better deal’ or ‘you’ve improved access [to health care] but not enough.’ It’s always easy to criticize what someone else has done. But that’s not going to improve things for veterans.” I asked if, in his opinion, some Republicans don’t want this administration to be able to claim more victories on behalf of veterans. McDonald replies, “Maybe that’s the issue. Maybe that’s the issue.” He says he hasn’t made that charge to committee leaders. “But one thing I did say is we’ve got to stop using veterans as political pawns. Veterans are getting very upset about standing behind candidates, being thanked for their service, but then not getting part of the sacred covenant Abraham Lincoln talked about in his second inaugural address.” If the priority is party politics, McDonald finds irony in the quest, because he was a Republican when nominated, a donor even to prominent GOP candidates from his home state of Ohio, including former House Speaker John Boehner. “Now I say my political party is the Veterans’ Party,” McDonald says. Next week: Committee Chairman Miller reacts to McDonald’s criticism and returns fire. And more from the secretary on post-election aims. Send comments to Military Update, P.O.

Banks are recovering from a sharp drop as Deutsche Bank tries to reassure investors about its financial health. Strong earnings from Costco are giving consumer stocks a lift and energy companies are also trading higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 200 points, or 1.1 percent, to 18,343 as of 2:30 p.m. Eastern time. It lost 195 points the previous day. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rebounded 22 points, or 1 percent, to 2,172. The Nasdaq composite rose 52 points, or 1 percent, to 5,321. DEUTSCHE BANK: Banks made the largest gains Friday as investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the massive cost of settling a U.S. investigation. The German bank has struggled for years to turn its business around and the Department of Justice wants it to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into mortgage-backed securities. “(A fine of) $14 billion basically wipes out their earnings for the year,” said Nathan Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management. If the bank agrees to a smaller payment, it would be a big relief to investors. Deutsche Bank’s U.S.-listed stock rose $1.70, or 14.8 percent, to $13.18. The stock has been pummeled this year and is trading near all-time lows. BANKS REBOUND: Financial stocks had tumbled Thursday afternoon as investors again worried about the Deutsche Bank’s health following reports that some hedge funds are moving their business out of the bank. Deutsche Bank is the largest lender in Germany, and investors are worried not just about its stock price, but the effect on the financial system if Deutsche Bank runs into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Thooft said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are problems to worry about, including the health of Italy’s banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and increased regulation, there’s little reason for investors to buy bank stocks. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added $1.13, or 1.7 percent, to $66.78 and Citigroup gained $1.60, or 3.5 percent, to $47.40. BIG SALE: Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.85, or 4 percent, to $153.34 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.47, or 1.7 percent, to $89.70 and Wal-Mart rose $1.64, or 2.3 percent, to $72.37. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices have surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world’s oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. While the gains for oil prices have slowed, investors were still optimistic that energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.95, or 1.9 percent, to $103.22 and EOG Resources rose $1.88, or 2 percent, to $96.93. OTHER ENERGY TRADING: Wholesale gasoline picked up 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.51 a gallon. Natural gas slipped 5 cents to $2.91 per 1,000 cubic feet. COGNIZANT: Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the information technology consulting and outsourcing firm said it’s investigating possible bribes paid to officials in India. Cognizant said it’s looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has informed the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant also said its president Gordon Coburn resigned. It named Rajeev Mahta, the former head of its IT Services business, as its new president. The stock fell $6.40, or 11.6 percent, to $48.60. CHIPPING IN: Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors continued to climb on reports the companies might combine. The Wall Street Journal said Qualcomm is in talks to buy its rival, and NXP gained $6.36, or 6.6 percent, to $102.49 and Qualcomm picked up $1.38, or 2 percent, to $68.83. NXP surged 17 percent Thursday and Qualcom rose 6 percent. TECH TRIUMPHANT: Major stock indexes set records this quarter, and tech stocks were by far the biggest reason. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 13 percent over the last three months. Apple surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Apple is the most valuable publicly-traded company in the world and Microsoft, the second-largest company on the S&P 500, is up 13 percent this quarter. Another tech giant, Google parent Alphabet, leaped 15 percent. BONDS: Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.60 percent from 1.56 percent. That sent stocks that pay high dividends, like utilities and real estate companies, lower than the rest of the market. METALS: Gold fell $8.90 to $1,317.10 an ounce. Silver rose 3 cents to $19.21 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.21 a pound. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 101.37 yen from 101.07 yen. The euro rose to $1.1233 from $1.1216. OVERSEAS: Germany’s DAX climbed 1 percent and France’s CAC 40 added 0.1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain lost 0.3 percent. Major indexes in Asia slumped on concerns about the banking industry. Japan’s Nikkei 225 slumped 1.5 percent and South Korea’s Kospi fell 1.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index sank 1.9 percent. banking Business dow jones finance Mississippi NASDAQ New York Stock Exchanage NEWS stocks 2016-09-30 Associated Press tweet Tagged with: banking Business dow jones finance Mississippi NASDAQ New York Stock Exchanage NEWS stocks Previous: Audit: Take back $3.4M in FEMA money from Mississippi school Next: Cattle prices falter despite good news About Associated Press More Stories Like This FAA grant to help repair Vicksburg airport drainage problems November 18, 2016 Tupelo works to provide utilities to annexed areas November 18, 2016 Mississippi joins fight for legal sports betting November 18, 2016 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

By Harmeet Singh September 30, 2016 Hires, promotions and other news Citizen Relations has announced three recent additions to its senior team. Sarah Crabbe joins the Toronto team as SVP, leading a number of the PR shop’s national consumer accounts. Most recently, she was SVP and national practice lead for consumer marketing at Edelman Canada. Meanwhile, Alain Madgin joins as SVP in Citizen’s Quebec City office to oversee its government and public affairs practice, along with new business. Most recently, he was VP, government affairs at McKesson Canada. Lastly, Ian Baillie has joined the Vancouver team as senior account director, corporate and public affairs. He was most recently regional director for British Columbia at the Canadian Wind Energy Association. Grey Canada, Saatchi & Saatchi Canada and Leo Burnett Toronto (alongside its Chicago office) all picked up wins at the D&AD Impact awards this week for their work with Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America (one Black Pencil, one Wood Pencil), The Canadian Centre for Gender and Sexual Diversity (one Wood Pencil) and P&G’s Always brand (one White Pencil), respectively. The full list of winners is available on the D&AD website. Zulu Alpha Kilo picked up several wins at this year’s Kinsale Shark Awards, including a Gold in Film for its “Lily & the Snowman” spot for Cineplex. It also was awarded for its work for Harley-Davidson, Corona and Interac, along with its own agency work, including its “Say No to Spec” video. The Griffin Farley Search for Beautiful Minds Canada program – a planning/strategy bootcamp and networking event – has returned this year, with tickets for the finalist showcase on Oct. 27 now on sale. New business Smoke’s Poutinerie has selected Rack & Pinion as its creative agency. The shop will oversee the QSR’s digital efforts, web design and development, food photography and creative video content. Rack & Pinion has previously worked with Bento Sushi, BioSteel, Psiphon, Extreme Pita, and AMJ Campbell. Toronto’s A&C has announced two new client wins and a new website, which has a refreshed brand position centred on the shop being a communications agency, rather than solely PR and sponsorship. On the win side, the shop has picked up work for retailer Brika and the PBR Monster Energy Canada Tour, a bull riding event new to Canada. The agency will handle all strategic marketing communications planning for Brika and the national media tour for the event.

Media Vice Media and BMO have teamed up to launch Vice Money, covering money issues for a youth audience and allowing the bank to reach more millennials. Snapchat has changed its name to Snap Inc., though its signature app will keep the name. The idea was to shift the company name away from that product only, as it develops new ones, including Spectacles, a pair of Bluetooth-connected, camera-enabled sunglasses. Matt Ramella has been promoted from his role as VP of digital at UM Canada to become head of digital strategy and partnerships at the agency’s parent company IPG Mediabrands. Ramella had been with UM in the VP role since 2013.

Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains Friday as Germany's largest bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the massive cost of settling a U.S. investigation into mortgage securities. Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued to move higher, and strong earnings from Costco sent consumer stocks higher. Deutsche Bank is the largest lender in Germany, and investors are concerned about not only its plunging stock price, but the potential effect on the financial system if Deutsche Bank gets into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Those fears faded on Friday. FILE - In this Monday, Sept. 26, 2016, file photo, traders Kevin Lodewick, left, and Richard Cohen work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks are bouncing back early Friday, Sept. 30, 2016, after a steep loss late the previous day. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) "People came to the realization that this isn't likely to be a big systemic risk that ripples through the financial sector," said Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rebounded 17.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,312. The Department of Justice wants Deutsche Bank to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into mortgage-backed securities, and the stock jumped Friday after a report that the bank could settle the case with a smaller payment. Deutsche Bank's U.S.-listed stock rose $1.61, or 14 percent, to $13.09. The stock has been pummeled this year and is trading near all-time lows. Financial stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon following reports that some hedge funds were moving their business out of Deutsche Bank. On Friday, bank stocks and the broader market regained almost all of those losses. Thooft said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are causes for concern, including the health of Italy's banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and regulation getting tighter, there are plenty of reasons for investors to avoid bank stocks. That didn't stop the financial sector, the weakest sector in the market this year, from rallying on Friday. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added 94 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $66.59 and Citigroup gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $47.23. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world's oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. Investors hope energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.65, or 1.6 percent, to $102.92 and EOG Resources rose $1.66, or 1.7 percent, to $96.71. Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.02, or 3.4 percent, to $152.51 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.52, or 1.7 percent, to $89.75 and Wal-Mart rose $1.39, or 2 percent, to $72.12. Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the information technology consulting and outsourcing firm said it's investigating possible bribes paid to officials in India. Cognizant said it's looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has informed the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant also said its president Gordon Coburn resigned. The stock fell $7.37, or 13.4 percent, to $47.63. Major stock indexes set records this quarter thanks mostly to tech stocks. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 12 percent over the last three months. Apple, the most valuable company in the S&P 500, surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Microsoft, the next-largest company, rose 13 percent and another tech giant, Google parent Alphabet, leaped 14 percent. Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.60 percent from 1.56 percent. Stocks that pay high dividends, like utilities and real estate and phone companies, traded lower. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline picked up 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Natural gas slipped 5 cents to $2.91 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $8.90 to $1,317.10 an ounce. Silver rose 3 cents to $19.21 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.21 a pound. The dollar rose to 101.41 yen from 101.07 yen. The euro rose to $1.1237 from $1.1216. Germany's DAX climbed 1 percent and France's CAC 40 added 0.1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain lost 0.3 percent. Major indexes in Asia slumped on concerns about the banking industry. Japan's Nikkei 225 slumped 1.5 percent and South Korea's Kospi fell 1.2 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index sank 1.9 percent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains on Friday as Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest, tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the cost of settling a United States investigation into mortgage securities. Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued to move higher, and strong earnings from Costco sent consumer stocks higher. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rebounded 17.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,312. Investors are concerned about not only Deutsche Bank’s plunging stock price, but about the potential effect on the financial system if the giant bank gets into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Those fears faded on Friday. “People came to the realization that this isn’t likely to be a big systemic risk that ripples through the financial sector,” said Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Department of Justice wants Deutsche Bank to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into mortgage-backed securities, and the stock jumped on Friday after a report that the bank could settle the case with a smaller payment. Deutsche Bank’s United States-listed stock rose $1.61, or 14 percent, to close at $13.09. The stock has been pummeled this year and is trading near record lows. Financial stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon after reports that some hedge funds were moving their business out of Deutsche Bank. On Friday, bank stocks and the broader market regained almost all of those losses. Mr. Thooft said he did not think banks were in great danger, but he said there were causes for concern, including the health of Italy’s banks. With interest rates so low and regulation getting tighter, there are plenty of reasons for investors to avoid bank stocks. The Dow Minute by Minute Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals on Friday. 18,400 18,300 18,200 Previous close 18,143.45 18,100 10 a.m. Noon 2 p.m. 4 p.m. Source: Reuters SEPT. 30, 2016 By The New York Times That did not stop the financial sector, the weakest sector in the market this year, from rallying on Friday. JPMorgan Chase added 95 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at $66.59, and Citigroup gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $47.23. Benchmark United States crude oil rose 41 cents to settle at $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world’s oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. Investors hope energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.65, or 1.6 percent, to close at $102.92, and EOG Resources rose $1.66, or 1.8 percent, to $96.71. The warehouse-club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.02, or 3.4 percent, to $152.51 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.52, or 1.7 percent, to $89.75, and Walmart rose $1.39, or 2 percent, to $72.12. Cognizant Technology Solutions, an information technology consulting and outsourcing firm, tumbled after it said it was investigating possible bribes paid to officials in India. Cognizant said it was looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and had informed the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Cognizant also said its president, Gordon Coburn, resigned. The stock fell $7.29, or 13.25 percent, to $47.71. Major stock indexes set records this quarter thanks mostly to tech stocks. The S.&P. 500 technology index climbed 12 percent over the last three months. Apple, the most valuable company in the S.&P. 500, surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Microsoft, the next largest company, rose 13 percent. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, leapt 14 percent. Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.60 percent from 1.56 percent. Stocks that pay high dividends, like utilities and real estate and phone companies, traded lower. Gold fell $4.61, to $1,315.75 an ounce. Silver rose 3 cents, to $19.21 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents, to $2.21 a pound. The dollar rose to 101.39 yen from 101.04 yen. The euro rose to $1.1231 from $1.1219. The DAX in Germany climbed 1 percent, and the CAC 40 in France added 0.1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain lost 0.3 percent. Major indexes in Asia slumped on concerns about the banking industry. The Nikkei 225 in Japan slumped 1.5 percent, and the Kospi in South Korea fell 1.2 percent. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong sank 1.9 percent.

In the transaction, P&G transferred the assets and liabilities of P&G Specialty Beauty Brands, other than specified excluded brands, to Galleria Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of P&G created to facilitate the transaction, and Galleria Co. will merge with a subsidiary of Coty Inc. COTY, +0.46% and become a wholly owned subsidiary of Coty. Upon completion of the merger, each share of Galleria Co. common stock will be converted into the right to receive one share of Coty class A common stock. The exchange offer expired at 12:00 midnight, Eastern Daylight (New York City) Time, on September 29, 2016. P&G shareholders who tendered their shares of P&G common stock in the exchange offer will receive approximately 3.9033 shares of Coty class A common stock (subject to receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares) for each share of P&G common stock accepted for exchange. Exchange Offer Preliminary Results Pursuant to the exchange offer and based on a preliminary count by the exchange agent, approximately 691,105,648 shares of P&G common stock were tendered prior to the expiration of the exchange offer, including 383,204,614 shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures. The total number of shares tendered includes an estimated 1,488,679 shares of P&G common stock tendered by odd-lot shareholders not subject to proration. P&G intends to accept 104,969,205 of the tendered shares in exchange for the 409,726,299 shares of Galleria Co. common stock owned by P&G and offered for exchange. Based on the total number of shares of P&G common stock reported to be tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the exchange offer, the exchange offer was oversubscribed by approximately 586,136,443 shares, including shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures, resulting in a preliminary proration factor of approximately 15.01 percent. P&G will not be able to determine the final proration factor until the end of the exchange offer’s guaranteed delivery period at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 4, 2016. P&G will publicly announce the final proration factor, which may be different from today’s preliminary estimate, once it has been determined. Because more than 104,969,205 shares of P&G common stock were tendered, all shares of Galleria Co. common stock owned by P&G are expected to be distributed to P&G shareholders who tendered their shares of P&G common stock in the exchange offer, and no shares of Galleria Co. common stock are expected to be distributed to P&G shareholders as a pro rata dividend. For more information about the proposed transaction, please visit the website that P&G maintains for the exchange offer at www.dfking.com/pg. For more information about the exchange offer, please contact the information agent, D.F. King & Co., Inc., at (212) 269-5550 (for banks and brokers) and (877) 297-1747 (for all other callers).

Nelson / Los Angeles Times September 30, 2016 04:10 AM  Times Colonist  Agnes Nixon was the creative force behind the popular soap operas One Life to Live and All My Children. She died Wednesday in Haverford, Pennsylvania, at 93.   Photograph By Chris Pizzello, The Associated Press Previous Next Agnes Nixon was the creative force behind the popular soap operas One Life to Live and All My Children. She died Wednesday in Haverford, Pennsylvania, at 93. The grand dame of daytime television drama, Agnes Nixon liked to say that “everyone’s life is a soap opera.” For proof, she offered up her own. She had an “abandonment complex” because her parents divorced soon after she was born. Growing up in an Irish Catholic enclave in Nashville, Tenn., in the 1930s and 1940s, she felt painfully different because the other children all seemed to have fathers. Hers was “nearly psychotic” and schemed to crush her post-collegiate dream of being a writer. He wanted his daughter to follow him into his burial garments business and arranged for her to meet Irna Phillips, a pioneering writer of radio serials who her father was certain would “set me straight” regarding the foolishness of a writing career, Nixon often said. And then Nixon invariably inserted a soap opera staple into the story — the plot twist. During the meeting, Phillips looked up from reading the sample script that was Nixon’s resume and asked, “How would you like to work for me?” “It was one of the greatest moments of my life,” Nixon later said. “It was freedom.” Nixon, who went on to create such enduring daytime TV dramas as “One Life to Live” and “All My Children,” died Wednesday at a senior living facility in Pennsylvania. She was 93. Daytime stars, as well as behind-the-scenes personnel, took to social media to express their sadness. “I am devastated to learn that we have lost Agnes,” said “All My Children” star and soap opera royalty Susan Lucci. “I adored her and admired her — and I am forever grateful to her! May this liveliest and loveliest of women rest in peace.” “Days of Our Lives” head writer Dena Higley called Nixon a “tiny lady, but a force of nature,” while “The Young and the Restless” actress Melissa Claire Egan remembered her as a “true trailblazer.” Robert A. Iger, chairman and CEO of Walt Disney Co., said in a statement: “It is with a heavy heart I mourn the passing of television pioneer Agnes Nixon, someone I was proud to call a friend. “Agnes’ impact on daytime television and pop culture is undeniable. She was the first to champion socially relevant topics, and the towns and characters Agnes brought to life leave an indelible imprint on television that will be remembered forever.” Although her characters were inevitably embroiled in melodrama, Nixon was repeatedly honored for elevating soaps during a television career that spanned more than 60 years. She brought attention to such once-taboo topics as racism, AIDS, lesbian relationships and teenage prostitution. In 1962, Nixon wrote a story line for “The Guiding Light” on CBS about a character who develops uterine cancer and has a life-saving hysterectomy. The network and show sponsor Proctor & Gamble agreed to the plot only if the words “cancer,” “uterus” and “hysterectomy” were not used. “I thought, well, hmmm, that’s a little tough,” Nixon told National Public Radio in 2010, so she had the doctor tell the patient that she had “irregular cells, rather than possible cancer ... . It was very successful, and that hooked me.” When “One Life to Live” debuted in 1968, it featured a complicated story aimed at making viewers confront their prejudices, Nixon later said. It involved a young black woman that the audience is led to believe is white; she plans to marry a white doctor, but later falls in love with a black resident. A man in Seattle wrote “to protest that white girl kissing that black resident,” Nixon recalled in the NPR interview and laughed. Then he said: “But I am getting confused. If she turns out to be black, I want to protest her kissing the white doctor.” When Nixon was recognized in 2010 with a Daytime Emmy for lifetime achievement, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences said that she had “totally changed the traditionally escapist nature of daytime serials while straining to make the world a better place.” She wasn’t trying to “break barriers,” Nixon said in 1999 on the TV biography “Intimate Portraits,” but thought it was insane “to say that entertainment and public service can never be in the same story.” In 1981, the television academy had given Nixon its highest honor, the Trustees Award, for “distinguished service to television and the public.” She was the first woman to receive the distinction, joining an elite group that includes Edward R. Murrow and Bob Hope. After writing the initial weeks of “Search for Tomorrow” for CBS in 1951, she played a role in the success of six other soap operas. She helped Phillips launch “As the World Turns” on CBS in 1956 and, two years later, joined the network’s “Guiding Light” as head writer. In 1964, she took charge of NBC’s ratings-challenged “Another World” and turned it around. Within four years, ABC came calling with a powerful enticement — creative control. Her husband, Robert Nixon, left his job as a Chrysler Corp. executive, and the couple formed a company to produce her first solo effort, “One Life to Live.” The show quickly won praise for realism after premiering in 1968. A story on teenage venereal disease caused 50,000 viewers to write in, and an official at the Centers for Disease Control told Nixon: “You’ve shown us how to reach the teenagers of America,” the Los Angeles Times said in 1991. When ABC wanted a second daytime drama, Nixon came up with “All My Children” in 1970. She also co-created a third soap for the network, “Loving,” that aired from 1983 to 1995. Nixon readily acknowledged “All My Children” as her favorite dramatic offspring. The show was set in Pine Valley, the presumptive dramatic equivalent of Rosemont, the Philadelphia suburb where Nixon lived in a pre-Revolutionary War home. She based archvillain Adam Chandler, who didn’t “know how to love,” on her father and gave her favorite character, wickedly manipulative Erica Kane, abandonment issues. Lucci became one of daytime’s most popular stars playing Erica from the show’s earliest days until the program’s end in September 2011. She repeatedly called Nixon “a genius as a storyteller.” When “One Life to Live” left the air in early 2012, few network soap operas remained. As women increasingly entered the workforce, viewership eroded and the genre continued to lose ground to cable and Internet offerings. “The name of entertainment is escape,” Nixon said in 1981 in People magazine, and it made her wealthy, one excruciatingly slow plot turn at a time. In the mid-1970s, Nixon had sold both “One Life” and “All My Children” to ABC for an undisclosed sum. “I loved the writing and I hated the business,” Nixon told the Times in 1998, when it was reported that she earned more than $1 million a year. She was born Agnes Eckhardt on Dec. 10, 1922, in Chicago, to Harry and Agnes Eckhardt and grew up in Nashville living with her bookkeeper mother and extended family. Previous reports put her year of birth as 1927 but the announcement of her funeral Mass said she was born five years earlier. At Northwestern University, she studied drama alongside Charlton Heston and Patricia Neal but felt “outclassed” as an actor, Nixon later said, and turned to writing. Days after earning a bachelor’s degree in the late 1940s, Nixon was writing for Phillips on a radio soap. When Phillips headed west to work in television, Nixon moved to New York to write for early prime-time TV dramas. On a blind date in 1950, she met her future husband and soon agreed to marry him on one condition — that she could continue her career. They settled in the Philadelphia area and had four children in five years. With no time to travel to New York City for work, she returned to Phillips and soaps, writing at home and mailing in her scripts. Having a bustling career in the “pre-Betty Friedan days” was tough and made her feel like a misfit, she told The Washington Post in 1983. For years, she and her husband split their time between the Philadelphia area and New York City. After he died in 1996, Nixon said she found writing “All My Children” therapeutic. By then, she had long devoted herself to long-range plotting and still followed her mentor’s maxim: “We don’t just live the high points and low points, we live minute by minute.” Nixon is survived by her four children, Cathy, Mary, Robert and Emily; and 11 grandchildren. © Copyright Times Colonist Related Tonight's TV schedule Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

Sep 30th 2016, 6:03 AM 24,122 Views 31 Comments Share1906 Tweet Email Image: Shutterstock/Steve Cordory THEY’VE BEEN BANNED in a number of countries, and now it looks like microbeads are set for the chopping block in Ireland – if the Dáil agrees to pass a new bill tabled by the Green Party. The tiny plastic beads, present in many cosmetic products, are not biodegradable and can affect marine life. What are microbeads? Microbeads are tiny balls of plastic – smaller than 5mm but usually between 0.0004-1.24 mm wide – which are most common in soaps, shower gels and facial scrubs, used to exfoliate your skin. They are also found in some toothpastes and abrasive cleaners. Back in 2014, An Taisce called for a “quick phase out” of microbeads, saying that the beads are absorbed or eaten by sea creatures and could potentially be absorbed by humans. They also contribute to the so-called ‘plastic soup’ that has accumulated in the world’s oceans. The Pacific Ocean, for example, is home to a patch of rubbish made of plastic, known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Plastic debris is capable of being broken down into tiny particles which might be ingested by sea animals and birds. Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch=azwKxDVGmns&t=) Source: National Science Foundation/YouTube A site called Beat the Microbead outlines the types of products that contain microbeads. It notes that Unilever announced in 2012 that all of its products worldwide would be plastic-free by 2015, that Proctor and Gamble said it would be microbead-free by 2017, and that Johnson and Johnson has already started phasing out microbeads. A list of other companies that have pledged to get rid of microbeads can be found here. Climate Change Minister Denis Naughten said on Morning Ireland that he is aware the EU has been discussing tackling the issue of microbeads. It’s a huge and growing problem, not just in this country but internationally. The EU is also looking at this issue. I think there is a role for the EU in relation to this but in Ireland as well, to look at banning microbeads getting into our water systems because they’re having a huge impact in relation to our fish stocks, and in relation to our clean water standards. He made the comments as he was on his way to speak with other climate ministers from OECD countries this week. British MPs recently said that a worldwide ban of microbeads in cosmetics should be enforced as soon as possible. The chair of Britain’s Environmental Audit Committee, Mary Creagh, told the BBC that a single shower can result in 100,000 plastic particles entering the ocean. Plans to ban I just spoke in the #Seanad about new @greenparty_ie legislation to get #microbead plastic pollution out of our seas https://t.co/2JZX9uwCV1— Grace O'Sullivan (@SenGraceOSllvn) September 28, 2016 Source: Grace O'Sullivan/Twitter The Department for Housing, Planning and Local Government said last month that Ireland supports “the principle of banning of microbeads”. It also said that a timeframe is needed before a blanket ban is introduced so that the “industry has time to adapt”. However, the Green Party published legislation this week to ban microbeads, called the Micro-Plastic and Micro-Bead Pollution Prevention Bill 2016. The bill would prohibit the manufacture and sale of products containing microbeads and the addition of microbeads to cosmetics, soaps or similar products. It would also create an offence of sale or manufacture of such products and provides for a fine on prosecution of up to €10,000 for each item for sale, sold, or manufactured. Under the legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would be responsible for monitoring the levels of microbeads in Irish waters. Green Party Senator Grace O’Sullivan said that the bill is on its way as the party is concerned about the long-term public health implications of micro-beads. “The US has already banned them, the UK are beginning a process to do so, and even Cosmetics Europe, the industry lobby in the EU, have recommended they be phased out,” she pointed out. “We’ve had legislation ready on banning micro-beads for a while, and we’re publishing it in light of Minister Naughten’s comments. We welcome that the Government are considering such a ban.” She added: There are a huge amount of products, such as facial scrubs, soaps, and toothpaste that contain thousands of plastic microbeads. These are flushed down drains and make their way into the environment. Many of these microbeads are too small to be filtered out during ordinary wastewater treatment, and end up in our rivers, lakes and seas. These beads are then ingested by fish and other marine organisms. Once ingested, these micro-beads attract other pollutants, many of which are recognised to have serious impacts on human health. These toxins accumulate in fish, and can be passed on to humans who eat them. Senator O’Sullivan said that the party is sure there will be cross-party support on this bill. Microbeads and water Ervia said that microbeads would most likely end up in surface water after going down the plughole, but “it is likely there would be considerable removal of these beads during the settlement process in typical wastewater treatment plants”. “Any concentration of microbeads that do enter a surface water course and are abstracted into drinking water treatment process, would be subjected to coagulation, flocculation and filtration processes which would most likely remove any remaining concentration of microbeads to trace levels.” Ireland is working with European partner countries under the Oslo-Paris Convention (OSPAR) on studying the effectiveness of wastewater treatment plants and storm drainage in removing plastics. The country is also undertaking national research on the effectiveness of indigenous urban wastewater facilities in removal of these materials. The Department of Environment said that “it is considered that unilateral action by individual countries may have a limited effect in this area and that a coordinated approach is required”. Consequently, The Marine Strategy Framework Directive is the overarching legislative context that covers marine litter in the European context. Also in the international domain, research undertaken under OSPAR on micro plastics will form the basis for future developments on the issue of removal of the microbeads from products.

However, no matter what the age, the 27-year-old - who first found fame in S Club Juniors - has opened up about how she has learned to deal with a very modern phenomena: online trolls. Speaking exclusively to the MailOnline, The Saturdays star revealed it's impossible to get away from people's opinions, but even so, she's glad to be to 'connected' with her fans. Scroll down for video  Thick skin: Frankie Bridge - who first found fame in S Club Juniors - has opened up about the thick skin she has had to grow with the emergence of online trolls on social media She shared: 'When I started out there was no social media, I didn’t know if people didn’t like my hair or my outfit, but now, with social media, you can’t get away from people’s opinion.  'Its great in so many ways as it keeps you so much more connected to fans and you get to share so much more.'

Share this article Share Although happy to have an outlet to chat with her fans, the brunette beauty - who first rose to fame in 2001 - opened up about the darkside of being online while launching the Superdrug and P&G #FeelSuper Campaign. Speaking about nasty online trolls, Frankie insisted she's learned to be 'thick skinned' about the negative commentary that comes with being a person in the public eye on social media.   'But it also means you can see negative comments,' she added. 'I’ve learnt to be thick skinned about these things but I totally understand why you would feel really hurt by things trolls say.' 'I’ve recently been talking about this a lot and the response has been really positive.' The music starlet has taken cyber bullying into her own hands recently - having appeared on BBC and Chanel 5 discussing the topic - going in search of internet haters. She continued: 'Everyone knows what it’s like to some extent to have someone say something bad about you and it’s a topic that is really in the public eye right now. 'What was so interesting about the documentary was to actually track down and talk to the trolls behind the nasty comments as you realise they are just normal people and nothing to be scared of or upset by.'  'Not date night kind of people': Opening up about injecting some romance into their relationship, Frankie admitted they're not 'date night kind of people' (pictured with Wayne in 2015) When not hunting down cyber bullies, the proud mum-of-two - Carter, one, and Parker, two - is keeping the spark alive in her marriage to former Reading footballer Wayne Bridge, 36. The songstress wed the sports star in Woburn Abbey, Bedfordshire in 2014 after nearly fours years of dating. Opening up about injecting some romance into their relationship, Frankie admitted they're not 'date night kind of people' but gushed about what a great father he is to their young boys - who in her eyes are growing up 'too fast'.   'We’re not date night kind of people but we do try and take an hour a day to spend time with each other,' she revealed. 'He’s a great dad and just watching him play with the boys and raising them into amazing young people is so special. Daddy day care: Frankie couldn't help but gush about what a great father he is to their young boys - Carter and Parker 'But if we do have time we might go for a nice meal or to the cinema.'  She continued: 'I’m lucky that I get to spend a lot of time with the boys, and with Wayne too! We’re always all together which is great.  'Parker will be 3 this year which is scary, it might sound clichéd but they really do grow up too fast!!' Mammy's boys: The pop star couldn't help but say her little tots are growing up 'too fast' The pop star was on hand to launch the #FeelSuperSalon in London's Soho on Thursday as part of #FeelSuper campaign from P&G and Superdrug. The initiative aims to raise £200,000 for the Marie Curie charity, the UK's leading charity caring for people living with any terminal illness.  A donation is made to the charity every time a P&G product is bought in store at Superdrug or on their online outlet from September 21 to October 18.  Speaking about the worthwhile campaign, Frankie said: 'Marie Curie is a really special charity which I’ve supported for many years.  'The challenging work the nurses do is amazing and its been such a privilege to spend time with them during this campaign seeing this first hand.'  Giving back: The pop star was on hand to launch the #FeelSuperSalon in London's Soho on Thursday as part of #FeelSuper campaign from P&G and Superdrug  Worthwhile: The initiative aims to raise £200,000 for the Marie Curie charity, the UK's leading charity caring for people living with any terminal illness Read more: Marie Curie | Care and support through terminal illness Share or comment on this article e-mail 6 shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains Friday as Germany's largest bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rebounded 17.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,312. Financial stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon following reports that some hedge funds were moving their business out of Deutsche Bank. On Friday, bank stocks and the broader market regained almost all of those losses. Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management, said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are causes for concern, including the health of Italy's banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and regulation getting tighter, there are plenty of reasons for investors to avoid bank stocks. That didn't stop the financial sector, the weakest sector in the market this year, from rallying on Friday. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added 94 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $66.59 and Citigroup gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $47.23. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world's oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. Investors hope energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.65, or 1.6 percent, to $102.92 and EOG Resources rose $1.66, or 1.7 percent, to $96.71. Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.02, or 3.4 percent, to $152.51 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.52, or 1.7 percent, to $89.75 and Wal-Mart rose $1.39, or 2 percent, to $72.12. Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the information technology consulting and outsourcing firm said it's investigating possible bribes paid to officials in India. Cognizant said it's looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has informed the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant also said its president Gordon Coburn resigned. The stock fell $7.37, or 13.4 percent, to $47.63. Major stock indexes set records this quarter thanks mostly to tech stocks. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 12 percent over the last three months. Apple, the most valuable company in the S&P 500, surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Microsoft, the next-largest company, rose 13 percent and another tech giant, Google parent Alphabet, leaped 14 percent. Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.60 percent from 1.56 percent. More Business Cozy retirement?

Honest Co., which is now five years old, sells a range of products including diapers, soap, lotion and cleaning products - all free from 'harsh chemicals'. But the Wall Street Journal, in a report published in March, said it tested Honest Co.'s detergent at two laboratories and found it had sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) - an ingredient it told customers it would never use. The detergent bottles for years had claimed the product is 'free of' SLS. Honest Co. - co-founded by Jessica Alba, pictured - had long denied claims its laundry detergent contained an ingredient it told customers it would never use At the time, the company strongly denied the claims stating its detergent did not contain SLS, but rather sodium coco sulfate, an ingredient it says is a 'gentler alternative.' It also said conducted 'rigorous testing' and accused the Journal of being both wrong and 'reckless.' Honest executives said in March the company had no plans to reformulate the detergent. Chemists interviewed by the Journal said sodium coco sulfate is a mixture of cleaning agents that includes a large amount of SLS.  The company - valued at $1.7 billion also provided Wall Street Journal with a certificate stating there was no SLS in the product from its detergent manufacturer, Earth Friendly Products, according to the statement.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Feeling blue? Jessica Alba cuts a chic figure in indigo... Google takes aim at Uber with Waze Rider 'carpool' app that... Share this article Share A Wall Street Journal article claims that the Honest detergent (pictured) contains sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)  There have been rumors that the company may go public or be sold to a bigger player But now it appears the company is finally backing down and is planning to roll out a new laundry detergent in 2017 that doesn't contain sodium coco sulfate.  The company told The Wall Street Journal, Honest said it is making changes to multiple products, including dish soap, detergent and other cleaners, 'utilizing an advanced sugar-based surfactant technology to further improve the efficacy of our products.' The company said its research team 'consistently works to innovate across our entire product line while adhering to The Honest Company's uncompromising safety standards.' Replacing the laundry detergent with a new formula would remove any ambiguity over the SLS issue, which caused Honest to face backlash from some customers.  The move comes at a crucial time for the company which is in discussions with several large companies about a potential sale or initial public offering, which could also be an option.  The company has had talks with consumer-products giants including Unilever PLC,Procter & Gamble Co., Clorox Co. and Johnson & Johnson, according to the Jorunal.  Honest currently generates roughly $300 million in annual sales, and was valued at $1.7 billion during a private funding round in August 2015.  In Alba's 2013 book The Honest Life (pictured), Alba listed SLS as a 'toxin' that consumers should avoid This isn't the first time Honest is launching new versions of its products after facing scrutiny from consumers and the media. Honest Co. is also facing a class action lawsuit from customers who say the company's sunscreen failed to protect them, causing sun burns. That case is still pending and Honest Co. has said its products are safe.  The Honest Company was started in 2012 with 17 products and now has more than 120 items, which are sold at more than 4,000 retailers across the United States and Canada.

Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains Friday as Germany’s largest bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the massive cost of settling a U.S. investigation into mortgage securities. Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued to move higher, and strong earnings from Costco sent consumer stocks higher. Deutsche Bank is the largest lender in Germany, and investors are concerned about not only its plunging stock price, but the potential effect on the financial system if Deutsche Bank gets into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Those fears faded on Friday. “People came to the realization that this isn’t likely to be a big systemic risk that ripples through the financial sector,” said Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rebounded 17.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,312. The Department of Justice wants Deutsche Bank to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into mortgage-backed securities, and the stock jumped Friday after a report that the bank could settle the case with a smaller payment. Deutsche Bank’s U.S.-listed stock rose $1.61, or 14 percent, to $13.09. The stock has been pummeled this year and is trading near all-time lows. Financial stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon following reports that some hedge funds were moving their business out of Deutsche Bank. On Friday, bank stocks and the broader market regained almost all of those losses. Thooft said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are causes for concern, including the health of Italy’s banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and regulation getting tighter, there are plenty of reasons for investors to avoid bank stocks. That didn’t stop the financial sector, the weakest sector in the market this year, from rallying on Friday. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added 94 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $66.59 and Citigroup gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $47.23. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world’s oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. Investors hope energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.65, or 1.6 percent, to $102.92 and EOG Resources rose $1.66, or 1.7 percent, to $96.71. Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.02, or 3.4 percent, to $152.51 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected.

This was the first of a series of events planned under a USPWC supply chain diversity initiative that aims to help women owned businesses access sustainable markets by linking them with corporate procurement representatives. The next event will be hosted by the Wecreate Pakistan resource center for women entrepreneurs in Islamabad. Women entrepreneurs attending the event included those who received training at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) through the U.S. Embassy-supported Pakistan Women Entrepreneur Program (PWEP) managed in partnership with American University, as well as women from the World Bank’s Women entrepreneurship training program conducted in partnership with Enclude at Government College University. USPWC member companies PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble joined locally-based companies Bulleshah Paper Mills, Dinnipon Inks and Packages Limited in presenting on how women entrepreneurs may enter corporate supply chains. For example, while women owned businesses in fields such as promotion and advertising already do supply large corporations; women-run businesses of all sizes can provide printing services, janitorial services, canteen and food services, day care services, or innovative corporate gifts and stationery.

Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains Friday as Germany’s largest bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the massive cost of settling a U.S. investigation into mortgage securities. Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued to move higher, and strong earnings from Costco sent consumer stocks higher. Deutsche Bank is the largest lender in Germany, and investors are concerned about not only its plunging stock price, but the potential effect on the financial system if Deutsche Bank gets into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Those fears faded on Friday. “People came to the realization that this isn’t likely to be a big systemic risk that ripples through the financial sector,” said Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rebounded 17.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,312. The Department of Justice wants Deutsche Bank to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into mortgage-backed securities, and the stock jumped Friday after a report that the bank could settle the case with a smaller payment. Deutsche Bank’s U.S.-listed stock rose $1.61, or 14 percent, to $13.09. The stock has been pummeled this year and is trading near all-time lows. Financial stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon following reports that some hedge funds were moving their business out of Deutsche Bank. On Friday, bank stocks and the broader market regained almost all of those losses. Thooft said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are causes for concern, including the health of Italy’s banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and regulation getting tighter, there are plenty of reasons for investors to avoid bank stocks. That didn’t stop the financial sector, the weakest sector in the market this year, from rallying on Friday. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added 94 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $66.59 and Citigroup gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $47.23. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world’s oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. Investors hope energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.65, or 1.6 percent, to $102.92 and EOG Resources rose $1.66, or 1.7 percent, to $96.71. Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.02, or 3.4 percent, to $152.51 after it reported a profit larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.52, or 1.7 percent, to $89.75 and Wal-Mart rose $1.39, or 2 percent, to $72.12. Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the information technology consulting and outsourcing firm said it’s investigating possible bribes paid to officials in India. Cognizant said it’s looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has informed the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant also said its president Gordon Coburn resigned. The stock fell $7.37, or 13.4 percent, to $47.63. Major stock indexes set records this quarter thanks mostly to tech stocks. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 12 percent over the last three months. Apple, the most valuable company in the S&P 500, surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones.

The euro rose to $1.1237 from $1.1216. Germany’s DAX climbed 1 percent and France’s CAC 40 added 0.1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain lost 0.3 percent. Major indexes in Asia slumped on concerns about the banking industry. Japan’s Nikkei 225 slumped 1.5 percent and South Korea’s Kospi fell 1.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index sank 1.9 percent.

Column: Barbarian at the gate 1:32 p.m. EDT September 30, 2016 James E. Baker Community Press guest columnist In the first presidential debate, we saw what the Cincinnati Enquirer, Arizona Republic and Dallas Morning News saw when they changed their long-held political opinions and endorsed Hillary Clinton, saying that Donald Trump was unfit to be president. Clinton looked positively “presidential,” while Trump constantly “sniffed,” drank water, made faces, leaned on the podium and insisted in interrupting both Clinton and the moderator with hysterical shouts and screams. “The Donald” was a train wreck and gave the performance of a baffoon. Talking about “stamina,” Clinton had all the stamina. Trump desperately needed to blow his nose, as his sniffing was interfering with his speech. His constant drinking indicated that he was very frightened and upset. He was losing the debate in every area. He has no definitive plan for any problem; he is lazy; he was unprepared, and he cannot focus. His tax strategy only benefits the upper 5 percent of income earners, it will create about $4 trillion in new debt, making it very difficult to pay our debts and repair our infrastructure. He was not specific about how he would retain or attract jobs for the United States. Trump kept harping on reducing taxes, which he claimed, would generate millions of new jobs. Our last experiment with this approach failed. Lower taxes to the bottom 90 percent do increase jobs, as they spend it all, increasing the economy. Trump blamed Clinton for being totally out of control. It was he who was totally out of control throughout the entire debate. Donald was rude, crude, argumentative, wrong on a number of comments, and easily rattled…he “choked,” using his own vernacular. Trump’s performance was straight out of the sixth-grade. His constantly changing facial grimaces were those of a sixth-grade boy. Only 5 percent of you have the wealth to afford to vote Republican. None of their policies will put a dime in your pocket. In fact, their health care proposal will cost you a fortune. Trump wants to repeal Obamacare with absolutely nothing to replace it, except the old private health policies that contain exclusions, caps on coverage and pre-existing conditions. Even if you work for GE or P&G, your cost of a private policy will be unaffordable. This country needs Medicare-for-all. It is cheap, efficient, and it eliminates the insurance companies that, over several decades, have stolen the practice of medicine from doctors. This saves about 25 percent on health care. Medicare administration costs are less than 2 percent . Republican refusal to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices is a needless cost to old people and all taxpayers. A Republican Congress will not raise the minimum wage; Congress has received nine wage increases since the last minimum wage increase. Republicans will not allow equal pay for women. If you are a 10-year old rape victim, Republicans want to force you to carry the baby to term and give birth. This is insane. Vote straight Democrat, even for dogcatcher.

Strong earnings from Costco are giving consumer stocks a lift. Banks, too, are recovering from a sharp drop as Deutsche Bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Energy companies are also trading higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 117 points, or 0.6 percent, to 18,260 as of 10:10 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 10 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,161. The Nasdaq composite rose 19 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,288. BANKS BOUNCE BACK: Banks made some of the largest gains. The stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon as investors again worried about the health of Deutsche Bank, the largest lender in Germany, following reports that some hedge funds are moving their business out of the bank. Late Thursday CEO John Cryan tried to calm investors. In a letter to Deutsche Bank employees, he said the bank has $241 billion in reserves and is meeting its capital requirements. Deutsche Bank's U.S.-listed stock rose 71 cents, or 6.2 percent, to $12.20. Its stock has been pummeled this year and is trading at all-time lows. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added 68 cents, or 1 percent, to $66.33 and Citigroup gained 61 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $46.41. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 7 cents to $47.90 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international benchmark, remained at $49.81 a barrel in London. Oil prices have surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than third of the world's oil, agreed to a small cut in production in a surprise decision. While the gains for oil prices have slowed, investors were still optimistic that energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Hess jumped 87 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $53.02 and Spectra Energy rose 67 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $42.99. BIG SALE: Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.65, or 3.8 percent, to $153.14 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.37, or 1.6 percent, to $89.60 and Wal-Mart rose $1.29, or 1.8 percent, to $72.02. CHIPPING IN: Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors continued to climb on reports the companies might combine. The Wall Street Journal said Qualcomm is in talks to buy its rival, and NXP gained $6.37, or 6.6 percent, to $102.49 and Qualcomm picked up $1.95, or 2.9 percent, to $69.40.That followed a bigger move a day ago. COGNIZANT CEO: Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the technology consulting company said President Gordon Coburn resigned. It named Rajeev Mahta, the former head of its IT Services business, as its new president. The stock fell $7.47, or 13.6 percent, to $47.53. TECH TRIUMPHANT: Major stock indexes set records this quarter, and tech stocks were by far the biggest reason. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 12 percent over the last three months, its best result since the end of 2013. Apple surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Apple is the most valuable publicly-traded company in the world. The second-largest tech company, Microsoft, is up 12 percent this quarter and Google parent Alphabet leaped 14 percent. BONDS: Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 1.56 percent. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 101.21 yen from 101.07 yen. The euro remained at $1.1216.

U.S. stocks are bouncing back early Friday, Sept. 30, 2016, after a steep loss late the previous day. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........NEW YORK — U.S. stocks climbed Friday as banks made a rapid recovery following a steep fall a day ago. Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains Friday as Germany’s largest bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the massive cost of settling a U.S. investigation into mortgage securities. Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued to move higher, and strong earnings from Costco sent consumer stocks higher. Deutsche Bank is the largest lender in Germany, and investors are concerned about not only its plunging stock price, but the potential effect on the financial system if Deutsche Bank gets into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Those fears faded on Friday. “People came to the realization that this isn’t likely to be a big systemic risk that ripples through the financial sector,” said Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management. Advertisement Continue reading The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rebounded 17.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,312. The Department of Justice wants Deutsche Bank to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into mortgage-backed securities, and the stock jumped Friday after a report that the bank could settle the case with a smaller payment. Deutsche Bank’s U.S.-listed stock rose $1.61, or 14 percent, to $13.09. The stock has been pummeled this year and is trading near all-time lows. Financial stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon following reports that some hedge funds were moving their business out of Deutsche Bank. On Friday, bank stocks and the broader market regained almost all of those losses. Thooft said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are causes for concern, including the health of Italy’s banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and regulation getting tighter, there are plenty of reasons for investors to avoid bank stocks. That didn’t stop the financial sector, the weakest sector in the market this year, from rallying on Friday. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added 94 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $66.59 and Citigroup gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $47.23. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world’s oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. Investors hope energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.65, or 1.6 percent, to $102.92 and EOG Resources rose $1.66, or 1.7 percent, to $96.71. Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.02, or 3.4 percent, to $152.51 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.52, or 1.7 percent, to $89.75 and Wal-Mart rose $1.39, or 2 percent, to $72.12.

Cognizant said it’s looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has informed the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant also said its president Gordon Coburn resigned. The stock fell $7.37, or 13.4 percent, to $47.63. Major stock indexes set records this quarter thanks mostly to tech stocks. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 12 percent over the last three months. Apple, the most valuable company in the S&P 500, surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Microsoft, the next-largest company, rose 13 percent and another tech giant, Google parent Alphabet, leaped 14 percent. Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.60 percent from 1.56 percent. Stocks that pay high dividends, like utilities and real estate and phone companies, traded lower. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline picked up 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Natural gas slipped 5 cents to $2.91 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $8.90 to $1,317.10 an ounce. Silver rose 3 cents to $19.21 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.21 a pound. The dollar rose to 101.41 yen from 101.07 yen. The euro rose to $1.1237 from $1.1216. Germany’s DAX climbed 1 percent and France’s CAC 40 added 0.1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain lost 0.3 percent. Major indexes in Asia slumped on concerns about the banking industry. Japan’s Nikkei 225 slumped 1.5 percent and South Korea’s Kospi fell 1.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index sank 1.9 percent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Share Tweet LinkedIn Print Subscribe Most Recent Biz News Suggested Stories: Asian stocks lower on renewed worries about banking sector – Sep 29, 2016 Global stocks lower on renewed worries about banking sector – Sep 30, 2016 Deutsche Bank shares swing wildly amid stability concerns – Sep 30, 2016 Q&A: Will Deutsche Bank become the next Lehman? – Sep 30, 2016 Advertisement Comments Subscribe to the Journal for only $12.

Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains Friday as Germany's largest bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the massive cost of settling a U.S. investigation into mortgage securities. Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued to move higher, and strong earnings from Costco sent consumer stocks higher. Deutsche Bank is the largest lender in Germany, and investors are concerned about not only its plunging stock price, but the potential effect on the financial system if Deutsche Bank gets into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Those fears faded on Friday. FILE - In this Monday, Sept. 26, 2016, file photo, traders Kevin Lodewick, left, and Richard Cohen work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks are bouncing back early Friday, Sept. 30, 2016, after a steep loss late the previous day. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) "People came to the realization that this isn't likely to be a big systemic risk that ripples through the financial sector," said Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rebounded 17.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,312. The Department of Justice wants Deutsche Bank to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into mortgage-backed securities, and the stock jumped Friday after a report that the bank could settle the case with a smaller payment. Deutsche Bank's U.S.-listed stock rose $1.61, or 14 percent, to $13.09. The stock has been pummeled this year and is trading near all-time lows. Financial stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon following reports that some hedge funds were moving their business out of Deutsche Bank. On Friday, bank stocks and the broader market regained almost all of those losses. Thooft said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are causes for concern, including the health of Italy's banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and regulation getting tighter, there are plenty of reasons for investors to avoid bank stocks. That didn't stop the financial sector, the weakest sector in the market this year, from rallying on Friday. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added 94 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $66.59 and Citigroup gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $47.23. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world's oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. Investors hope energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.65, or 1.6 percent, to $102.92 and EOG Resources rose $1.66, or 1.7 percent, to $96.71. Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.02, or 3.4 percent, to $152.51 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.52, or 1.7 percent, to $89.75 and Wal-Mart rose $1.39, or 2 percent, to $72.12. Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the information technology consulting and outsourcing firm said it's investigating possible bribes paid to officials in India. Cognizant said it's looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has informed the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant also said its president Gordon Coburn resigned. The stock fell $7.37, or 13.4 percent, to $47.63. Major stock indexes set records this quarter thanks mostly to tech stocks. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 12 percent over the last three months. Apple, the most valuable company in the S&P 500, surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Microsoft, the next-largest company, rose 13 percent and another tech giant, Google parent Alphabet, leaped 14 percent. Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.60 percent from 1.56 percent. Stocks that pay high dividends, like utilities and real estate and phone companies, traded lower. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline picked up 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Natural gas slipped 5 cents to $2.91 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $8.90 to $1,317.10 an ounce. Silver rose 3 cents to $19.21 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.21 a pound. The dollar rose to 101.41 yen from 101.07 yen. The euro rose to $1.1237 from $1.1216. Germany's DAX climbed 1 percent and France's CAC 40 added 0.1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain lost 0.3 percent. Major indexes in Asia slumped on concerns about the banking industry. Japan's Nikkei 225 slumped 1.5 percent and South Korea's Kospi fell 1.2 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index sank 1.9 percent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Picture by Trevor Walker. David Sedgwick Email 08:55 Friday 30 September 2016 0 Have your say Residents have welcomed the re-opening of a popular play park after it underwent a £20,000 refurbishment. A special event took place to mark the reopening of the facility in Seghill, which is bordered by The Crescent, The Close and surrounding area. Coun Darren Mullen, chairman of Seaton Valley Council, was on hand to cut the ribbon to officially re-open the refurbished play park while guests were able to enjoy ice creams, balloons and gifts. The park has had new equipment added to it and has gone through a complete make-over. Railings have been repainted in bright colours and colour has been added to the , while youngsters have helped install a mural on the adjacent garage wall. A total of £20,000 has been spent – half from the council and the remaining from the Big Lottery Fund’s Awards for All. The scheme has been an example of partnership working, with a number of sections of the community involved. Homes for Northumberland repaired its adjoining garages, Procter and Gamble and local volunteers helped repaint the dull fencing around the park, Kompan Plc assisted with design and consultation services and Northumberland County Council’s Youth Service supervised the design and painting of the new mural. Council clerk Simon Potts said: “It’s great to see the first cog of our playground’s renewal programme in Seghill being delivered. We hope to deliver a new play park at Hill Avenue/Kentmere Close in the future.” “We have longer term ambitions to further develop play facilities at Seghill Welfare. Additionally we are in the process of finalising plans to renew our play park at Mitford Avenue, Seaton Delaval.” Sign in {* #userInformationForm *} Sign in socially {* loginWidget *} with your email address {* traditionalSignIn_emailAddress *} {* traditionalSignIn_password *} {* traditionalSignIn_signInButton *} Forgot your password?

 Jessica Alba's Honest Company is finally removing a controversial ingredient from its products Avery Hartmans Sep. 30, 2016, 5:35 PM 5,160 facebook linkedin twitter email print REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni The Honest Company is finally removing a controversial ingredient from its laundry detergents after initially saying it didn't plan to do so.  According to a new story out from the Wall Street Journal's Serena Ng, Honest Company — Jessica Alba's $1.7 billion household products company — is planning to introduce a new detergent in 2017 that's free of an ingredient called sodium coco sulfate. The ingredient is said to contain a large amount of sodium lauryl sulfate, a cleaning agent that Honest Company has said in the past it doesn't use at all.  The fact that Honest Company was using the ingredient first came to light in March, when the Journal reported that lab tests found SLS in the detergents. The news was problematic for Honest Company, in that it thereby defies the central pitch of the company: that it sells "honestly safe, effective essentials for family and home." Alba's company came under fire last summer, too, when people claimed that its sunscreen didn't work. Honest Company's issues arise at a tense time for the startup, which filed to go public earlier this year. This month, Recode reported that the company was planning to sell itself to Proctor & Gamble or Unilever. Now, the Journal reports that Clorox and Johnson & Johnson might be interested in buying the company as well.  "Our internal R&D team, led by Dr. Laurence Dryer, consistently works to innovate across our entire product line while adhering to The Honest Company’s uncompromising safety standards," Honest Company wrote in a statement. "As part of this process, we are continuing to work on a new breakthrough cleaning line, including dish care, laundry and household cleaners, utilizing an advanced sugar-based surfactant technology to further improve the efficacy of our products."

WCPO Embroiled in controversy, the Cincinnati VA Medical Center has named a new director. Vivian Hutson will oversee an annual budget of $373 million and a staff of 2,1oo. Col. Vivian Hutson is the new VA Director in Cincinnati. Credit army Hutson recently retired as a Colonel from the U.S. Army Medical Specialist Corps and comes to the VA from the Office of the Surgeon General. She replaces Interim Director Glenn Costie. A nationally appointed committee took testimony in September in whistleblower cases at the Cincinnati VA Medical Center and is expected to conclude its findings in 90 days. During an interview with reporters at the American Legion Convention in August, Costie said Dr. Gene Goldman will lead the board made up of three to four people. More than 30 people were asked to testify in the case that primarily centers around Dr. Barbara Temeck. She alleges nearly three dozen former and current staff members, who have complained both publicly and in a letter to Secretary of Veterans Affairs Bob McDonald about cost-cutting moves and hospital safety, are retaliating against her because they are being financially impacted. McDonald told members of the American Legion the media has largely ignored the progress that has been made in delivering veterans health care through the VA system. "You've heard many times that the VA is broken,'' McDonald said. "I disagree. The VA can be and is being reformed." Yes, the former CEO of Procter & Gamble said, there are VA employees who have not done their jobs, but they are being weeded out of the system. "It's a gross misrepresentation to cherry-pick one of them and hold that person up as an example of all," said McDonald.

McNamara, who previously was head of Europe and Americas for the division whose product portfolio includes Tums antacids and Sensodyne toothpaste, succeeds Emma Walsmley, who last week was named to succeed Andrew Witty as CEO of the pharmaceutical giant when he retires in March. McNamara’s promotion, announced Thursday, takes effect immediately. “With his significant experience and expertise, Brian is the clear choice to build on the current momentum we are seeing in our business and fully maximize the future opportunities we have with our brands,” Witty said in a statement. McNamara joined GSK last year from Novartis upon completion of the transaction in which GSK acquired Novartis’s global vaccines business and created a joint consumer healthcare business controlled by GSK. He spent 11 years at Novartis and 16 years at Procter & Gamble. London-based GSK employs about 2,600 at its North American headquarters at Research Triangle Park and has another 800 employees and contractors at its manufacturing plant in Zebulon.

Descriptions of millennials and their spending habits often run the risk of resorting to stereotypes but for businesses operating in Asia, these qualities remain key in guiding customer engagement strategies. Home to almost 60 percent of the global millennial population—typically described as those between the ages of 16 and 35, emerging Asia is fast turning into a battleground among both traditional and online retailers for the hearts (and wallets) of consumers. Key reasons for the region's appeal: The rapid rate of urbanization, as well as the large youth populations, which are expected to translate into a larger consumer base when they come of age. "Chinese consumers [are] in the process of consumption upgrading," said Daniel Zhang, chief executive officer of Alibaba, "People are basically changing their lifestyle[s]." One of the brains behind the creation of the now legendary Single's Day shopping event, Zhang said that the reason for its inception was to have people remember Alibaba's at-the-time new business-to-consumer Taobao Mall (now rebranded as Tmall) platform. "The reason we created [Single's Day] is probably for one thing, it's for survival," he said.

Last year alone, Alibaba attracted 434 million active buyers, according to the company's annual report. Of these shoppers, 80 percent were aged below 35, Zhang said. To cater to the digitally engaged demographic, Zhang highlighted how an Alibaba merchant last week conducted a livestream with the newly-minted Olympic Chinese women's volleyball team and reached millions of customers. "This is not purely for gaming [or] for interaction. This is also for sales," Zhang said, "This sells tons of that product … within 30 minutes." Another emerging market on consumer businesses' priority list is India. Around 250 million people in the country own smartphones although half of them do not have access to data, said Kunal Bahl, chief executive officer of Snapdeal . While infrastructure issues and remote rural populations might present logistical challenges, they also present opportunities for businesses, such as the online marketplace Snapdeal, to develop solutions that differentiate themselves from the competition. "Indian e-commerce is where Chinese e-commerce was in 2007 or 2008. We are about 8 years behind but it's not going to take us 8 years to bridge the gap," said Bahl, highlighting the pace of 4G network expansion taking place in India.

As for what Asian consumers want, change appears to be the only constant, said Malina Ngai, chief operating officer of the A.S. Watson Group, which operates the Watsons chain of drugstores. "The cycle of planning is really, really short," Ngai said, "These days, no one can see for more than 10 years … We review the plan [every quarter] just to see where the customers are going and what we need to do to really get customers shopping more." Bahl, the CEO of Snapdeal, agreed, "Three years ago, I [kept] saying Indian consumers are all about ABCD: astrology, Bollywood, cricket and discounts … Then it became speed of refunds and returns. Now, it's becoming who can offer next-day delivery coverage." In addition, Asian consumers prefer goods that appeal to their "sensorial expressive side" , said Magesvaran Suranjan, president of Procter & Gamble Asia Pacific. "The products have to have a certain richness in perfumes [in Asia] than in the West," explained Suranjan. Packaging also has to be more vibrant than in the West to appeal to Asian consumers, he said. "Consumers in Asia want the best … They don't want emerging market service, they want developed market services but at emerging market prices," Snapdeal's Bahl said.
