In the transaction, P&G transferred the assets and liabilities of P&G Specialty Beauty Brands, other than specified excluded brands, to Galleria Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of P&G created to facilitate the transaction, and Galleria Co. will merge with a subsidiary of Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY) and become a wholly owned subsidiary of Coty. Upon completion of the merger, each share of Galleria Co. common stock will be converted into the right to receive one share of Coty class A common stock. The exchange offer expired at 12:00 midnight, Eastern Daylight (New York City) Time, on September 29, 2016. P&G shareholders who tendered their shares of P&G common stock in the exchange offer will receive approximately 3.9033 shares of Coty class A common stock (subject to receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares) for each share of P&G common stock accepted for exchange. Exchange Offer Preliminary Results Pursuant to the exchange offer and based on a preliminary count by the exchange agent, approximately 691,105,648 shares of P&G common stock were tendered prior to the expiration of the exchange offer, including 383,204,614 shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures. The total number of shares tendered includes an estimated 1,488,679 shares of P&G common stock tendered by odd-lot shareholders not subject to proration. P&G intends to accept 104,969,205 of the tendered shares in exchange for the 409,726,299 shares of Galleria Co. common stock owned by P&G and offered for exchange. Based on the total number of shares of P&G common stock reported to be tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the exchange offer, the exchange offer was oversubscribed by approximately 586,136,443 shares, including shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures, resulting in a preliminary proration factor of approximately 15.01 percent. P&G will not be able to determine the final proration factor until the end of the exchange offer's guaranteed delivery period at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 4, 2016. P&G will publicly announce the final proration factor, which may be different from today's preliminary estimate, once it has been determined. Because more than 104,969,205 shares of P&G common stock were tendered, all shares of Galleria Co. common stock owned by P&G are expected to be distributed to P&G shareholders who tendered their shares of P&G common stock in the exchange offer, and no shares of Galleria Co. common stock are expected to be distributed to P&G shareholders as a pro rata dividend. For more information about the proposed transaction, please visit the website that P&G maintains for the exchange offer at www.dfking.com/pg.

Huff, staff writer Tags: feminine hygiene products, toxic chemicals, women''s health (NaturalNews) A women's advocacy group fighting to eliminate toxic chemicals from consumer products and the environment has published a new report highlighting the dangers associated with many feminine hygiene and personal care products. Entitled "Chem Fatale," the paper by Women's Voices for the Earth (WVE) addresses the many toxic chemicals still being used in feminine products like tampons and deodorants, which expose women to a host of chemicals linked to endocrine disruption, reproductive problems and cancer. The report specifically targets the consumer giant Procterr & Gamble (P&G), which manufactures Tampax and Always, two of the most popular feminine care product brands in North America. According to a press release announcing the new paper, WVE's goal is to raise awareness about the dangers of the chemicals found in these products, and to push major corporations like P&G to remove them, or at the very least start labeling them. "Feminine care products are not just your average cosmetics because they are used on an exceptionally sensitive and absorbent part of a woman's body," said Alexandra Scranton, director of science and research at WVE and author of the new report. "Greater scrutiny, oversight and research are badly needed to assure the safety of their ingredients on women's health." Tampons, pads regulated as 'medical devices'; ingredient disclosure optional Of particular concern to the group are tampons and feminine pads, both of which are currently regulated as "medical devices" by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Since these two product classes are not considered under the law to be cosmetic in nature, manufacturers are not required to disclose their ingredients on packaging -- and not surprisingly, most of them don't! "Current regulations on chemicals used in feminine care products are not sufficient to protect public health, and often don't require the ingredient disclosure needed to assess safety," explains WVE. "Tampons and pads are regulated as medical devices, which means that companies are not required to disclose any ingredients in these products." But WVE hopes to change this by drawing attention to the sensitive nature of the areas on women's bodies where these products are typically used. According to the group, conventional tampons and pads may contain chemicals like dioxins and pesticide residues, which can cause cancer, as well as hormone disruptors like parabens -- parabens have also been shown to cause cancer -- that are much more easily absorbed by vaginal tissue than by regular skin. "Ingredients are determined 'safe,' operating under the premise that they are used on ordinary skin just like other cosmetic products," reads the report. "That means chemicals of concern such as carcinogens, reproductive toxins, endocrine disruptors, and allergens are being used on, or even in, the extremely permeable mucus membranes of the vaginal area." Mystery 'fragrance' ingredients in feminine care products also a health hazard Many feminine care products designated as "cosmetics" are also problematic, as they contain all sorts of added chemicals including "fragrance" ingredients, which as we previously reported do not have to be individually labeled, because they are protected under current law as "trade secrets." "Unfortunately, a 'fragrance' is a mixture of ingredients that can include any of over 3,000 different chemicals; and the components of any one fragrance are usually kept secret by manufacturers," explains the report. "According to a master list of fragrance chemicals made available by the International Fragrance Association, fragrances can include chemicals which are carcinogens, irritants, allergens, and potential endocrine disruptors." Nearly every category of feminine care product, from tampons and pads to wipes, washes, deodorants, anti-itch creams and douches, contains added fragrances, which is why WVE is urging women everywhere to avoid all fragranced products. The group is also concerned about the use of chemicals like methylchloroisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinone, two preservatives linked to causing contact dermatitis. Data reveal high levels of pesticides in tampons One category of toxins that the average woman would likely never expect in her feminine care products is pesticides, and yet independent, third-party-certified testing conducted by the group Naturally Savvy back in 2013 revealed that at least one major tampon brand contains up to nine different pesticides varieties. According to the study, the following residues were observed: • Malathion and malaoxon (metabolite): 1 ppm (parts per million) • Dichlofluanid: 1 ppm • Mecarbam: 6 ppm • Procymidone: 37 ppm • Methidathion: 5 ppm • Fensulfothion: 5 ppm • Pyrethrum: 66 ppm • Piperonyl butoxide: 1 ppm Though these levels are all below the maximum allowable threshold for pesticides in food, they do not meet the FDA's guidelines for tampons, which should be "free of pesticide residue." Additionally, the Pesticide Action Network lists malathion, malaoxon, mecarbam, procymidone, methidathion, fensulfothion and pyrethrum as possible endocrine disruptors, while the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lists piperonyl butoxide as a "possible human carcinogen," with malathion "suggestive of carcinogenicity." "Vulvar and vaginal tissue are structurally different than the skin of the rest of the body," reads a commentary published by Organic Slant. "That means this area of the body is potentially more vulnerable to exposure to toxic chemicals and irritants." Stop using conventional feminine care products and switch to natural alternatives WVE suggests that women not only switch to safer, cleaner alternatives such as unscented, chlorine-free, unbleached tampons and pads but possibly even reduce their overall use of feminine care products. In its report, the group cites recommendations from the American Public Health Association and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists against intra-vaginal cleaning (douching) and using most feminine sprays and powders, which are loaded with additives and chemicals. "Reduce your use of feminine care products... [and] eliminate use of products that may be unnecessary to a healthy vagina," advises WVE. Also, women should choose "unscented products where available (particularly tampons and pads)... [and] [l]ook for brands that disclose all ingredients, including fragrance ingredients."

(Photo: John Minchillo, AP) CINCINNATI -- Demand has exceeded supply in Procter & Gamble's tender offer to swap P&G shares for an eventual stake in New York beauty company Coty. The disclosure made Friday means P&G will be able to complete its split off from 41 beauty brands without spinning off any ownership to P&G shareholders that didn't participate in the stock swap. P&G shares hit a new 52-week high on Friday climbing 2.3% to $90.22 in trading at midday Friday. P&G shareholders offered more than six times as many shares needed to complete the transaction. To execute the split off, P&G needed shareholders to tender almost 105 million shares of P&G stock. Instead, P&G shareholders offered to tender more than 691 million shares. P&G, based in Cincinnati, will give small investors, tendering a total of nearly 1.5 million shares in odd-lots (less than 100 shares apiece), their full requested orders. Remaining shareholders will get roughly 15 percent of their order filled. A final proration will be determined on 5. p.m. ET Tuesday. P&G shareholders participating in the deal have agreed to swap 1 share of P&G stock for 3.9 shares of stock that will quickly convert into shares of Coty, which makes Rimmel makeup and Calvin Klein perfume. P&G priced the offer attractively, offering a 7.5% discount on shares that would convert to Coty stock to ensure interest in the transaction. After the split off occurs, shareholders of the new entity, Galleria Co. will see the new company merge immediately with Coty. The merger is expected to happen next week. Participating P&G shareholders will collectively own 54 percent of the new super-sized Coty, which will have 746 million shares outstanding and a market capitalization of about $19 billion. Coty will acquire eight P&G factories, 10,000 new workers, assume about $2 billion in debt and a raft of household names. P&G brands in the deal include: CoverGirl and Max Factor makeup, Wella and Clairol hair color and licensed  fragrances Hugo Boss, Lacoste and Gucci. With the closing of the beauty divestiture, P&G will complete its massive brand divestiture announced two years ago aimed at paring 100 noncore labels. When the deal is done, P&G executives have promised their company will be smaller, easier-to-run and poised to resume growing sales and profits. The completed tender offer will also have functioned as a massive share repurchase with P&G shrinking its outstanding shares by about 4% – enhancing the earnings per share and value of remaining shares. 360 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2dt0BoX

Plans to Deliver $22 Billion to Shareholders This Year The consumer goods titan's capital returns will set records in fiscal 2017. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Sep 29, 2016 at 3:26PM Image source: Getty Images. The fiscal year that just closed wasn't a strong one for Procter & Gamble's (NYSE:PG) business. Organic sales fell for the second straight year to stay barely positive at 1%. The company's earnings declined as well, ticking down 2%. Increasing capital returns have been a bright spot for investors, though. P&G spent $15.4 billion (100% of operating cash flow) on stock buybacks and dividends -- up from $11.9 billion (or 82% of cash flow) in fiscal 2015. Yet the company plans to blow past these recent results by giving shareholders $22 billion of capital over the next 12 months. That's greater than the individual market capitalization of more than half of the companies on the S&P 500. Here's how P&G aims to pull off one of the market's biggest cash return plans. Where the money is coming from As it did in the prior fiscal year, P&G's brand-shedding initiative will provide a significant chunk of these capital return funds. The company is almost done closing the sale of its Coty beauty product line, which will raise $15 billion that it can send to shareholders -- significantly above last year's biggest brand sale, the transfer of the Duracell battery line to Berkshire Hathaway for $8 billion. The selling off of these two large brands, and nearly 100 smaller ones, is leaving P&G with a 15% decline in its revenue base and a 5% drop in earnings power. But the resulting company, management hopes, will be faster growing, more flexible, and more profitable. Additional cash will be raised through efficiency initiatives. P&G has cut about $2 billion per year from its cost of goods, for example, and has found major savings in slicing advertising overhead while improving its inventory turnover rate. Overall, productivity savings are projected to amount to $10 billion over the next five fiscal years. Where the cash is going Over two-thirds of the capital that P&G is returning to shareholders this year will come in the form of stock repurchases. Most of that total will happen in conjunction with the Coty beauty sale, but the company will also regularly make direct share purchases, too. As a result, P&G's share count stands to continue falling at a significant pace -- adding to the 14% decline investors have seen over the last decade. PG Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Annual) data by YCharts. Dividends will play a much smaller role in the return plan, given that the company just increased its payout by the smallest amount in recent memory. Income investors will receive about $7 billion in dividends this year, right on par with last year's result. P&G's dividend raises since 2003. Data source: Company financial filings. Since reported earnings are under pressure from weak sales growth and unfavorable currency exchange moves, shareholders shouldn't expect significant dividend hikes, at least until the company's payout ratio falls closer to 50% from the near 80% mark it reached last year. Can P&G keep it up? P&G doesn't have a comparably huge brand sale in the works for next year that would inject billions into its capital return funds. Cost cuts and a projected return to stronger organic growth will have to do most of the heavy lifting then. Still, management is confident that it will deliver as much as $54 billion to shareholders over the next three years. That implies the cash return pace will fall to about $16 billion in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 from this year's record $22 billion haul.

Frankie Bridge has spoken candidly about how motherhood has changed her outlook on life. The Saturdays singer, who is currently supporting Superdrug and P&G's FeelSuper campaign to raise money for Marie Curie, has opened up about the biggest lesson she has learned being a mum-of-two to her and husband Wayne Bridge's sons Carter and Parker. CLICK TO VIEW GALLERY Frankie Bridge revealed what motherhood has taught her exclusively to HELLO! Online "Just to stress less," the 27-year-old told HELLO! Online exclusively. "It sounds stupid because you would have thought it goes the opposite way, but I've always been such an anxious person, I overthink everything. I'm always worrying about everyone and everything and actually, it's gone the opposite way since I've had children." She continued: "You don't have control over everything. Obviously I want the best for the boys and I worry about them, but you just can't stress too much. It takes less of the heat off yourself because you think less about yourself and what's going on in your life and more about theirs." The singer is fronting Superdrug and P&G's FeelSuper campaign That's not to say the brunette beauty doesn't allow herself some 'me-time', with Frankie revealing that one of her go-to pampering treatments is a nice soak in the bath. "I never used to be much of a bath person and now, I just really appreciate just getting that time being in the bath for at least ten minutes," she said. "Just to chill, maybe do a face mask or a hair mask or something like that – extra special little treatments." Her pampering products? "Just the kids' stuff or something like that!" she quips. She admitted that her beauty regime had changed since she had children, explaining that "you just want to be quick whatever you do". However, there is one golden skincare rule she makes sure to follow. "I will always take my make-up off at night, always," she said. She and husband Wayne have two adorable little boys When it comes to her favourite products, the London-born star admitted she prefers multi-tasking beauty heroes. "Olay do a nice two-in-one tinted moisturiser," she revealed. "I think nowadays everyone wants that natural glow, no-one really likes to look like they've made an effort." She added: "I think that as a mum, it's good because you can whack it on and you look healthy, that's always good." When it comes to her healthy lifestyle, Frankie admitted that she doesn't follow a particular diet, but does enjoy exercise as a way to unwind. "I try and work out most days," she confessed. "I know that's not very relaxing, but I go and do classes with my friends so I get to socialise and work out at the same time. It's just having that hour to myself, doing just one thing that I want to do a day, it's really good." The campaign aims to raise £200,000 for Marie Curie Husband Wayne has also inspired her to take up boxing, although she admitted she can't "keep up" with his routine. "I do boxing at a proper little boxing gym," she said. "Wayne does proper boxing – I try and keep up with him but I can't! I [also] do Pilates and T-REX, occasionally spinning but I hate it – that's if I'm really trying to make a good effort but there's not one part of it that I enjoy." It's been a busy few weeks for Frankie, who is once again fronting the FeelSuper campaign to help raise money for Marie Curie. "This is our second time around now, with Superdrug and P&G we're raising money for Marie Curie and we wanted to raise over £100,000 and we managed to raise over £200,000 in the end!" she revealed. "That equals ten nurses for a year for Marie Curie, so that was amazing. We thought, 'Oh, let's do it again' – so no pressure! Now we want to raise over £200,000 again." Frankie Bridge is once again supporting the Superdrug and P&G FeelSuper Campaign, which last year raised £200,000 for Marie Curie in 2015. From 21st September to 18th October, each time you buy selected P&G products in a Superdrug store nationwide or at Superdrug.com, including brands such as Max Factor, Olay, Gillette Pantene – and many more, P&G will make a donation to Marie Curie.

Kelsey Humphreys Contributor Producer, Host, Entrepreneur, Journalist, Author September 30, 2016 Since founding the now award-winning New York-based agency MRY in his bedroom in 2002, Matt Britton has worked with some of the world’s leading brands, such as Microsoft, Coca-Cola and Visa. He has also become a leader in social media marketing and millennial marketing. Britton has spoken at industry conferences around the globe and has become a featured advertising expert for CNBC, Mashable, Forbes, The New York Times and Wall Street Journal, among others. How did he go from solo consultant to employing more than 500 people and then a multi-million-dollar exit? First, he faced failure, launching an internet marketing firm out of college that burst along with the internet bubble. Even with clients such as Sony, eBay and Evite, the firm couldn’t survive and was bailed out by Youthstream Media Networks. He stayed at Youthstream as an employee for less than two years, then took the leap again, forming Mr Youth, which later became MRY. Britton has lived out the romantic one-man-show-turned-giant-agency story. Here are his best pieces of advice for consultants and freelancer out there eager to do the same. Learn from failures. After Britton’s first failed business, he tried to absorb as much as he could while employed at Youthstream.  “I learned a lot from [Youthstream]," he says. "How to work with brick-and-mortar traditional companies, Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola -- how those companies worked, how they evaluated agencies, etc.” He also believes there is tremendous value in finding a mentor and joining groups such as Young Professional Organization, two factors he says were vital to his success. But don’t play it too safe. Like many successful entrepreneurs I’ve interviewed, Britton recommends that you build a substantial financial cushion before you take the leap. But this cushion, Britton explains, should allow you to relax about your bills, and in turn take more risks. He says you have to go all in, right from the start.  “If you’re playing scared at the beginning, you’re going to make a lot of short-term decisions, and short-term decisions come back to haunt you later on,” he says. Create a clear vision. His number-one piece of advice for brand new entrepreneurs is to do one powerful, practical vision exercise: If your business had a dream press release written about it in 10 years, and received coverage in all the major business publications, what would that release say? Write that press release. At the start, many entrepreneurs don’t know how to manage time or what tasks to tackle each day, so Britton recommends they print and display the release where they can easily see it. “Hang it up on your wall, and every day when you’re doing things, ask yourself, ‘Is what I’m doing at this moment, contributing to me getting there?’” he says. Project that vision. Britton shared that when he launched Mr Youth in 2002, he would disguise his voice when answering his phone to give the appearance of an administrative assistant who didn’t exist. At the time, his small team of freelancers was virtual, but you wouldn’t have known it looking at the company website. He was confident he could deliver, and didn’t want potential clients to feel uneasy. “When you’re in your early stages, make sure that you portray stability and portray a certain level of sophistication and prestige,” he says. Cultivate trust. Today, it is even easier to fake a great online presence. Remember that that’s not enough though. Projection only works, Britton says, if you can deliver. Cultivating relationships and building trust, he explains, were the keys to securing his first few giant clients, such as Red Bull, even though the company knew he was running a small shop. "The best way to get a disproportionate amount of business relative to the size of your organization is through relationships and trust," he says. "They knew I would run through a wall for them if I had to, and because of that, they were willing to take a chance on me.” Britton then delivered for those clients and publicized the glowing testimonials he received, which started to build a name for himself and Mr Youth. More large clients followed. Find amazing people (and let them go). Scaling from one to 500 does not happen without hiring and retaining amazing team members. How do you find them? By getting out of your existing employees’ way. From there, word of mouth takes over, and the best of the best start seeking out your firm. What about the “free agent” movement that we’re living in? Use it to your advantage, Britton says. Hire freelancers to cut down costs, especially during your slow season. Know that a lot of your best talent has a “side hustle.” Leverage those rock stars while you have them, and you may get to play a part in their future success. “Get out of [your employees’] way," he says. "The companies that are unable to scale is because the founder hug the businesses so tight that they suffocate and paralyze them.” Britton practiced what he preaches, letting a product manager at MRY experiment and eventually leave to create Crowdtap. Britton served as an advisor of the on-demand participation network, which went on to raise more than 12 million in funding and is used by more than 100 of the largest brands and marketing agencies in the U.S.  Keep up the pace. Britton noticed a distinct disconnect between C-level executives who knew that Mark Zuckerberg was smart, yet didn’t value the 20-somethings within their companies. Brands and their executives need to continually think about, and listen to, the upcoming generation. MRY exploded because Britton could discuss big business in the boardroom, but build a campaign for the streets. Today, Britton says that means building memorable, short form, micro-targeted, mobile-ready messages “designed for the flick [of one’s finger].” Be patient. One of the biggest mistakes Britton sees young founders making is going for the big money too early. Instead of trying to cash in on your first crop of ideas as soon as possible, Britton says, plant as many seeds as possible. “Too many entrepreneurs and young business people are thinking ‘how can I make money tomorrow?’" he says. "You really have to think long term and build something you believe in and stay focused on the vision and the plan and know it’s ultimately going to pay off.” Watch more videos from "The Pursuit" on the show's YouTube channel.  Related: 6 Tips to Be a Successful Solopreneur Entrepreneur Network is a premium video network providing entertainment, education and inspiration from successful entrepreneurs and thought leaders.

Hidden Heroes is a groundbreaking campaign created by the Elizabeth Dole Foundation to call attention to the countries 5.5 million military and veteran caregivers. Ken-Yon Hardy/Stars and Stripes  Email  Print  Reddit  Tweet  Share  Google  More By TOM PHILPOTT | SPECIAL TO STARS AND STRIPES Published: September 29, 2016 “I was confirmed 97-to-0,” says Department of Veterans Affairs Secretary Bob McDonald, recalling the Senate vote in July 2014 on his nomination to lead 360,000 VA employees and an aging infrastructure in delivering health care, disability and education benefits, and a host of other services, to millions of veterans. “And what I sensed was an appetite for, an urging for, somebody with experience transforming large organizations to do that,” adds the retired chief executive officer and board chairman of Proctor & Gamble Co. “While I have seen that, I have seen it sporadically. And right now, perhaps because of the elections upcoming, we’re seeing a hiatus in that kind of thinking.” In an hourlong interview in his office overlooking the White House, McDonald expands on the surprisingly sharp critique of Congress he delivered a week earlier while testifying on recommendations of the congressionally chartered Commission on Care. McDonald is upset to see fiscal 2016 expiring with Congress having failed to pass up to two dozen pieces of legislation he labels “essential” for continuing to transform VA to better serve veterans — with faster access to quality health care outside VA, breaking a disgraceful logjam of disability claim appeals, shelving archaic statutes that handcuff staff, and more. The enthusiasm he felt on Capitol Hill two years ago came amid a patient wait-time scandal that alarmed veterans and demoralized the Veterans Health Administration. It also spurred Congress, nearing a long election-year recess, to swiftly negotiate and pass a flawed Veterans Choice Act, hailed with false promises that would confuse and anger veterans. McDonald, a top industry executive but also a West Point graduate who graduated Army Ranger School, not only was volunteering to clean up a mess but to transform the entire department, its legacy practices and systems, into a high-performance organization that would put customers — veterans — first. The transformation is well underway, McDonald says, but it won’t progress at the speed and breadth veterans deserve unless Congress helps. VA needs legislation to streamline and consolidate six separate community-base care programs that VA still must run in addition to the Choice program. It needs authority to repair a broken claims appeal system that has veterans waiting three years for a decision; to lift unnecessary limits on physician work hours; to extend VA authorities to maintain services, such as transportation to facilities in rural areas and for vocational rehabilitation, and to fix provider agreements with long-term care facilities so the hassles of dealing with VA don’t keep enticing these facilities to turn out vets. These are highlights of a 100 proposals sent to Congress with the VA budget in February, most of which haven’t been voted on by both the House and Senate to become law, McDonald says, despite the continuous pro-veteran rhetoric heard from Republicans holding majorities in both chambers. McDonald notes that in May the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee with bipartisan support cleared an omnibus bill, the Veterans First Act, packed with reforms. Yet no floor vote has been scheduled. A senator or two, it seems, has a hold on the bill, upset over how it would be funded or over how it would keep VA in control of access to non-VA health providers. Despite that disappointment, McDonald suggests he’s work well with the Senate committee and Chairman Johnny Isakson, R-Ga. The House, meanwhile, has passed many separate veterans bills that VA doesn’t view as critical. Recently it voted for the appeals process reforms VA wants, but linked it to tougher accountability measure that the administration opposes. The disputed provisions would relax employee job protections so that, at VA alone, staff could be fired or demoted more easily for wrongdoing or poor performance than is possible in other agencies. Many bills get passed “as demonstrations of a particular ideology [without] bipartisan support,” says McDonald. “As a result, it’s all about legislative jujitsu of can you get the president to agree to something he doesn’t want to agree to, by attaching something good to it.” McDonald says he realized soon after becoming secretary that veterans’ issues, even priority reforms strongly backed by veteran service organizations, are not free these days of the bitter partisanship that has made Congresses increasingly dysfunctional. “I perceived that relatively early on,” he says, “particularly when there was this spirit of ‘gotcha!’ If you say the wrong word, the political opposition tries to exploit it in order to embarrass the administration. It wasn’t something I was familiar with in business.” His harshest critics are Republicans on the House Veterans Affairs Committee. Its chairman, Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida, led lengthy investigations into the patient wait-time scandal and launched many other examinations of VA waste, fraud and abuse since taking the committee gavel in 2011. His staff pumps out a steady stream of press releases focusing on VA corruption. Miller says McDonald failed in his promise to establish “a climate of accountability” across VA workforce despite his claims of 3,750 staff firings. McDonald doesn’t mention Miller by name in our interview, but he’s the presumed target of some pointed remarks. “You’ve got to make a decision in life,” the secretary says. “Are you always going to be pointing out problems, which is easy to do, or are you going to be part of the solution? It’s a copout to be what I call an ‘against’ leader. You know, ‘I can negotiate a better deal’ or ‘you’ve improved access [to health care] but not enough.’ It’s always easy to criticize what someone else has done. But that’s not going to improve things for veterans.” I asked if, in his opinion, some Republicans don’t want this administration to be able to claim more victories on behalf of veterans. McDonald replies, “Maybe that’s the issue. Maybe that’s the issue.” He says he hasn’t made that charge to committee leaders. “But one thing I did say is we’ve got to stop using veterans as political pawns. Veterans are getting very upset about standing behind candidates, being thanked for their service, but then not getting part of the sacred covenant Abraham Lincoln talked about in his second inaugural address.” If the priority is party politics, McDonald finds irony in the quest, because he was a Republican when nominated, a donor even to prominent GOP candidates from his home state of Ohio, including former House Speaker John Boehner. “Now I say my political party is the Veterans’ Party,” McDonald says. Next week: Committee Chairman Miller reacts to McDonald’s criticism and returns fire. And more from the secretary on post-election aims. Send comments to Military Update, P.O.

Banks are recovering from a sharp drop as Deutsche Bank tries to reassure investors about its financial health. Strong earnings from Costco are giving consumer stocks a lift and energy companies are also trading higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 200 points, or 1.1 percent, to 18,343 as of 2:30 p.m. Eastern time. It lost 195 points the previous day. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rebounded 22 points, or 1 percent, to 2,172. The Nasdaq composite rose 52 points, or 1 percent, to 5,321. DEUTSCHE BANK: Banks made the largest gains Friday as investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the massive cost of settling a U.S. investigation. The German bank has struggled for years to turn its business around and the Department of Justice wants it to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into mortgage-backed securities. “(A fine of) $14 billion basically wipes out their earnings for the year,” said Nathan Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management. If the bank agrees to a smaller payment, it would be a big relief to investors. Deutsche Bank’s U.S.-listed stock rose $1.70, or 14.8 percent, to $13.18. The stock has been pummeled this year and is trading near all-time lows. BANKS REBOUND: Financial stocks had tumbled Thursday afternoon as investors again worried about the Deutsche Bank’s health following reports that some hedge funds are moving their business out of the bank. Deutsche Bank is the largest lender in Germany, and investors are worried not just about its stock price, but the effect on the financial system if Deutsche Bank runs into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Thooft said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are problems to worry about, including the health of Italy’s banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and increased regulation, there’s little reason for investors to buy bank stocks. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added $1.13, or 1.7 percent, to $66.78 and Citigroup gained $1.60, or 3.5 percent, to $47.40. BIG SALE: Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.85, or 4 percent, to $153.34 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.47, or 1.7 percent, to $89.70 and Wal-Mart rose $1.64, or 2.3 percent, to $72.37. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices have surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world’s oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. While the gains for oil prices have slowed, investors were still optimistic that energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.95, or 1.9 percent, to $103.22 and EOG Resources rose $1.88, or 2 percent, to $96.93. OTHER ENERGY TRADING: Wholesale gasoline picked up 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.51 a gallon. Natural gas slipped 5 cents to $2.91 per 1,000 cubic feet. COGNIZANT: Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the information technology consulting and outsourcing firm said it’s investigating possible bribes paid to officials in India. Cognizant said it’s looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has informed the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant also said its president Gordon Coburn resigned. It named Rajeev Mahta, the former head of its IT Services business, as its new president. The stock fell $6.40, or 11.6 percent, to $48.60. CHIPPING IN: Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors continued to climb on reports the companies might combine. The Wall Street Journal said Qualcomm is in talks to buy its rival, and NXP gained $6.36, or 6.6 percent, to $102.49 and Qualcomm picked up $1.38, or 2 percent, to $68.83. NXP surged 17 percent Thursday and Qualcom rose 6 percent. TECH TRIUMPHANT: Major stock indexes set records this quarter, and tech stocks were by far the biggest reason. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 13 percent over the last three months. Apple surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Apple is the most valuable publicly-traded company in the world and Microsoft, the second-largest company on the S&P 500, is up 13 percent this quarter. Another tech giant, Google parent Alphabet, leaped 15 percent. BONDS: Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.60 percent from 1.56 percent. That sent stocks that pay high dividends, like utilities and real estate companies, lower than the rest of the market. METALS: Gold fell $8.90 to $1,317.10 an ounce. Silver rose 3 cents to $19.21 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.21 a pound. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 101.37 yen from 101.07 yen. The euro rose to $1.1233 from $1.1216. OVERSEAS: Germany’s DAX climbed 1 percent and France’s CAC 40 added 0.1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain lost 0.3 percent. Major indexes in Asia slumped on concerns about the banking industry. Japan’s Nikkei 225 slumped 1.5 percent and South Korea’s Kospi fell 1.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index sank 1.9 percent. banking Business dow jones finance Mississippi NASDAQ New York Stock Exchanage NEWS stocks 2016-09-30 Associated Press tweet Tagged with: banking Business dow jones finance Mississippi NASDAQ New York Stock Exchanage NEWS stocks Previous: Audit: Take back $3.4M in FEMA money from Mississippi school Next: Cattle prices falter despite good news About Associated Press More Stories Like This FAA grant to help repair Vicksburg airport drainage problems November 18, 2016 Tupelo works to provide utilities to annexed areas November 18, 2016 Mississippi joins fight for legal sports betting November 18, 2016 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Most recently, he was VP, government affairs at McKesson Canada. Lastly, Ian Baillie has joined the Vancouver team as senior account director, corporate and public affairs. He was most recently regional director for British Columbia at the Canadian Wind Energy Association.

The full list of winners is available on the D&AD website. Zulu Alpha Kilo picked up several wins at this year’s Kinsale Shark Awards, including a Gold in Film for its “Lily & the Snowman” spot for Cineplex. It also was awarded for its work for Harley-Davidson, Corona and Interac, along with its own agency work, including its “Say No to Spec” video. The Griffin Farley Search for Beautiful Minds Canada program – a planning/strategy bootcamp and networking event – has returned this year, with tickets for the finalist showcase on Oct. 27 now on sale. New business Smoke’s Poutinerie has selected Rack & Pinion as its creative agency.

Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains Friday as Germany's largest bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the massive cost of settling a U.S. investigation into mortgage securities. Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued to move higher, and strong earnings from Costco sent consumer stocks higher. Deutsche Bank is the largest lender in Germany, and investors are concerned about not only its plunging stock price, but the potential effect on the financial system if Deutsche Bank gets into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Those fears faded on Friday. FILE - In this Monday, Sept. 26, 2016, file photo, traders Kevin Lodewick, left, and Richard Cohen work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks are bouncing back early Friday, Sept. 30, 2016, after a steep loss late the previous day. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) "People came to the realization that this isn't likely to be a big systemic risk that ripples through the financial sector," said Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rebounded 17.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,312. The Department of Justice wants Deutsche Bank to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into mortgage-backed securities, and the stock jumped Friday after a report that the bank could settle the case with a smaller payment. Deutsche Bank's U.S.-listed stock rose $1.61, or 14 percent, to $13.09. The stock has been pummeled this year and is trading near all-time lows. Financial stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon following reports that some hedge funds were moving their business out of Deutsche Bank. On Friday, bank stocks and the broader market regained almost all of those losses. Thooft said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are causes for concern, including the health of Italy's banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and regulation getting tighter, there are plenty of reasons for investors to avoid bank stocks. That didn't stop the financial sector, the weakest sector in the market this year, from rallying on Friday. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added 94 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $66.59 and Citigroup gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $47.23.

Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains on Friday as Deutsche Bank, Germany’s largest, tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the cost of settling a United States investigation into mortgage securities. Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued to move higher, and strong earnings from Costco sent consumer stocks higher. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rebounded 17.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,312. Investors are concerned about not only Deutsche Bank’s plunging stock price, but about the potential effect on the financial system if the giant bank gets into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Those fears faded on Friday. “People came to the realization that this isn’t likely to be a big systemic risk that ripples through the financial sector,” said Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The Department of Justice wants Deutsche Bank to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into mortgage-backed securities, and the stock jumped on Friday after a report that the bank could settle the case with a smaller payment. Deutsche Bank’s United States-listed stock rose $1.61, or 14 percent, to close at $13.09. The stock has been pummeled this year and is trading near record lows. Financial stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon after reports that some hedge funds were moving their business out of Deutsche Bank. On Friday, bank stocks and the broader market regained almost all of those losses. Mr. Thooft said he did not think banks were in great danger, but he said there were causes for concern, including the health of Italy’s banks. With interest rates so low and regulation getting tighter, there are plenty of reasons for investors to avoid bank stocks. The Dow Minute by Minute Position of the Dow Jones industrial average at 1-minute intervals on Friday. 18,400 18,300 18,200 Previous close 18,143.45 18,100 10 a.m. Noon 2 p.m. 4 p.m. Source: Reuters SEPT. 30, 2016 By The New York Times That did not stop the financial sector, the weakest sector in the market this year, from rallying on Friday. JPMorgan Chase added 95 cents, or 1.5 percent, to close at $66.59, and Citigroup gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $47.23. Benchmark United States crude oil rose 41 cents to settle at $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world’s oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. Investors hope energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.65, or 1.6 percent, to close at $102.92, and EOG Resources rose $1.66, or 1.8 percent, to $96.71. The warehouse-club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.02, or 3.4 percent, to $152.51 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.52, or 1.7 percent, to $89.75, and Walmart rose $1.39, or 2 percent, to $72.12. Cognizant Technology Solutions, an information technology consulting and outsourcing firm, tumbled after it said it was investigating possible bribes paid to officials in India. Cognizant said it was looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and had informed the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Major stock indexes set records this quarter thanks mostly to tech stocks. The S.&P. 500 technology index climbed 12 percent over the last three months. Apple, the most valuable company in the S.&P. 500, surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Microsoft, the next largest company, rose 13 percent. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, leapt 14 percent. Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.60 percent from 1.56 percent. Stocks that pay high dividends, like utilities and real estate and phone companies, traded lower. Gold fell $4.61, to $1,315.75 an ounce. Silver rose 3 cents, to $19.21 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents, to $2.21 a pound. The dollar rose to 101.39 yen from 101.04 yen. The euro rose to $1.1231 from $1.1219. The DAX in Germany climbed 1 percent, and the CAC 40 in France added 0.1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain lost 0.3 percent. Major indexes in Asia slumped on concerns about the banking industry. The Nikkei 225 in Japan slumped 1.5 percent, and the Kospi in South Korea fell 1.2 percent. The Hang Seng index in Hong Kong sank 1.9 percent.

In the transaction, P&G transferred the assets and liabilities of P&G Specialty Beauty Brands, other than specified excluded brands, to Galleria Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of P&G created to facilitate the transaction, and Galleria Co. will merge with a subsidiary of Coty Inc. COTY, +0.38% and become a wholly owned subsidiary of Coty. Upon completion of the merger, each share of Galleria Co. common stock will be converted into the right to receive one share of Coty class A common stock. The exchange offer expired at 12:00 midnight, Eastern Daylight (New York City) Time, on September 29, 2016. P&G shareholders who tendered their shares of P&G common stock in the exchange offer will receive approximately 3.9033 shares of Coty class A common stock (subject to receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares) for each share of P&G common stock accepted for exchange. Exchange Offer Preliminary Results Pursuant to the exchange offer and based on a preliminary count by the exchange agent, approximately 691,105,648 shares of P&G common stock were tendered prior to the expiration of the exchange offer, including 383,204,614 shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures. The total number of shares tendered includes an estimated 1,488,679 shares of P&G common stock tendered by odd-lot shareholders not subject to proration. P&G intends to accept 104,969,205 of the tendered shares in exchange for the 409,726,299 shares of Galleria Co. common stock owned by P&G and offered for exchange. Based on the total number of shares of P&G common stock reported to be tendered and not properly withdrawn prior to the expiration of the exchange offer, the exchange offer was oversubscribed by approximately 586,136,443 shares, including shares tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures, resulting in a preliminary proration factor of approximately 15.01 percent. P&G will not be able to determine the final proration factor until the end of the exchange offer’s guaranteed delivery period at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on October 4, 2016. P&G will publicly announce the final proration factor, which may be different from today’s preliminary estimate, once it has been determined. Because more than 104,969,205 shares of P&G common stock were tendered, all shares of Galleria Co. common stock owned by P&G are expected to be distributed to P&G shareholders who tendered their shares of P&G common stock in the exchange offer, and no shares of Galleria Co. common stock are expected to be distributed to P&G shareholders as a pro rata dividend. For more information about the proposed transaction, please visit the website that P&G maintains for the exchange offer at www.dfking.com/pg. For more information about the exchange offer, please contact the information agent, D.F. King & Co., Inc., at (212) 269-5550 (for banks and brokers) and (877) 297-1747 (for all other callers).

Nelson / Los Angeles Times September 30, 2016 04:10 AM  Times Colonist  Agnes Nixon was the creative force behind the popular soap operas One Life to Live and All My Children. She died Wednesday in Haverford, Pennsylvania, at 93.   Photograph By Chris Pizzello, The Associated Press Previous Next Agnes Nixon was the creative force behind the popular soap operas One Life to Live and All My Children. She died Wednesday in Haverford, Pennsylvania, at 93. The grand dame of daytime television drama, Agnes Nixon liked to say that “everyone’s life is a soap opera.” For proof, she offered up her own. She had an “abandonment complex” because her parents divorced soon after she was born. Growing up in an Irish Catholic enclave in Nashville, Tenn., in the 1930s and 1940s, she felt painfully different because the other children all seemed to have fathers. Hers was “nearly psychotic” and schemed to crush her post-collegiate dream of being a writer. He wanted his daughter to follow him into his burial garments business and arranged for her to meet Irna Phillips, a pioneering writer of radio serials who her father was certain would “set me straight” regarding the foolishness of a writing career, Nixon often said. And then Nixon invariably inserted a soap opera staple into the story — the plot twist. During the meeting, Phillips looked up from reading the sample script that was Nixon’s resume and asked, “How would you like to work for me?” “It was one of the greatest moments of my life,” Nixon later said. “It was freedom.” Nixon, who went on to create such enduring daytime TV dramas as “One Life to Live” and “All My Children,” died Wednesday at a senior living facility in Pennsylvania. She was 93. Daytime stars, as well as behind-the-scenes personnel, took to social media to express their sadness. “I am devastated to learn that we have lost Agnes,” said “All My Children” star and soap opera royalty Susan Lucci. “I adored her and admired her — and I am forever grateful to her! May this liveliest and loveliest of women rest in peace.” “Days of Our Lives” head writer Dena Higley called Nixon a “tiny lady, but a force of nature,” while “The Young and the Restless” actress Melissa Claire Egan remembered her as a “true trailblazer.” Robert A. Iger, chairman and CEO of Walt Disney Co., said in a statement: “It is with a heavy heart I mourn the passing of television pioneer Agnes Nixon, someone I was proud to call a friend. “Agnes’ impact on daytime television and pop culture is undeniable. She was the first to champion socially relevant topics, and the towns and characters Agnes brought to life leave an indelible imprint on television that will be remembered forever.” Although her characters were inevitably embroiled in melodrama, Nixon was repeatedly honored for elevating soaps during a television career that spanned more than 60 years. She brought attention to such once-taboo topics as racism, AIDS, lesbian relationships and teenage prostitution. In 1962, Nixon wrote a story line for “The Guiding Light” on CBS about a character who develops uterine cancer and has a life-saving hysterectomy. The network and show sponsor Proctor & Gamble agreed to the plot only if the words “cancer,” “uterus” and “hysterectomy” were not used. “I thought, well, hmmm, that’s a little tough,” Nixon told National Public Radio in 2010, so she had the doctor tell the patient that she had “irregular cells, rather than possible cancer ... . It was very successful, and that hooked me.” When “One Life to Live” debuted in 1968, it featured a complicated story aimed at making viewers confront their prejudices, Nixon later said. It involved a young black woman that the audience is led to believe is white; she plans to marry a white doctor, but later falls in love with a black resident. A man in Seattle wrote “to protest that white girl kissing that black resident,” Nixon recalled in the NPR interview and laughed. Then he said: “But I am getting confused. If she turns out to be black, I want to protest her kissing the white doctor.” When Nixon was recognized in 2010 with a Daytime Emmy for lifetime achievement, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences said that she had “totally changed the traditionally escapist nature of daytime serials while straining to make the world a better place.” She wasn’t trying to “break barriers,” Nixon said in 1999 on the TV biography “Intimate Portraits,” but thought it was insane “to say that entertainment and public service can never be in the same story.” In 1981, the television academy had given Nixon its highest honor, the Trustees Award, for “distinguished service to television and the public.” She was the first woman to receive the distinction, joining an elite group that includes Edward R. Murrow and Bob Hope. After writing the initial weeks of “Search for Tomorrow” for CBS in 1951, she played a role in the success of six other soap operas. She helped Phillips launch “As the World Turns” on CBS in 1956 and, two years later, joined the network’s “Guiding Light” as head writer. In 1964, she took charge of NBC’s ratings-challenged “Another World” and turned it around. Within four years, ABC came calling with a powerful enticement — creative control. Her husband, Robert Nixon, left his job as a Chrysler Corp. executive, and the couple formed a company to produce her first solo effort, “One Life to Live.” The show quickly won praise for realism after premiering in 1968. A story on teenage venereal disease caused 50,000 viewers to write in, and an official at the Centers for Disease Control told Nixon: “You’ve shown us how to reach the teenagers of America,” the Los Angeles Times said in 1991. When ABC wanted a second daytime drama, Nixon came up with “All My Children” in 1970. She also co-created a third soap for the network, “Loving,” that aired from 1983 to 1995. Nixon readily acknowledged “All My Children” as her favorite dramatic offspring. The show was set in Pine Valley, the presumptive dramatic equivalent of Rosemont, the Philadelphia suburb where Nixon lived in a pre-Revolutionary War home. She based archvillain Adam Chandler, who didn’t “know how to love,” on her father and gave her favorite character, wickedly manipulative Erica Kane, abandonment issues. Lucci became one of daytime’s most popular stars playing Erica from the show’s earliest days until the program’s end in September 2011. She repeatedly called Nixon “a genius as a storyteller.” When “One Life to Live” left the air in early 2012, few network soap operas remained. As women increasingly entered the workforce, viewership eroded and the genre continued to lose ground to cable and Internet offerings. “The name of entertainment is escape,” Nixon said in 1981 in People magazine, and it made her wealthy, one excruciatingly slow plot turn at a time. In the mid-1970s, Nixon had sold both “One Life” and “All My Children” to ABC for an undisclosed sum. “I loved the writing and I hated the business,” Nixon told the Times in 1998, when it was reported that she earned more than $1 million a year. She was born Agnes Eckhardt on Dec. 10, 1922, in Chicago, to Harry and Agnes Eckhardt and grew up in Nashville living with her bookkeeper mother and extended family. Previous reports put her year of birth as 1927 but the announcement of her funeral Mass said she was born five years earlier. At Northwestern University, she studied drama alongside Charlton Heston and Patricia Neal but felt “outclassed” as an actor, Nixon later said, and turned to writing. Days after earning a bachelor’s degree in the late 1940s, Nixon was writing for Phillips on a radio soap. When Phillips headed west to work in television, Nixon moved to New York to write for early prime-time TV dramas. On a blind date in 1950, she met her future husband and soon agreed to marry him on one condition — that she could continue her career. They settled in the Philadelphia area and had four children in five years. With no time to travel to New York City for work, she returned to Phillips and soaps, writing at home and mailing in her scripts. Having a bustling career in the “pre-Betty Friedan days” was tough and made her feel like a misfit, she told The Washington Post in 1983. For years, she and her husband split their time between the Philadelphia area and New York City. After he died in 1996, Nixon said she found writing “All My Children” therapeutic. By then, she had long devoted herself to long-range plotting and still followed her mentor’s maxim: “We don’t just live the high points and low points, we live minute by minute.” Nixon is survived by her four children, Cathy, Mary, Robert and Emily; and 11 grandchildren. © Copyright Times Colonist Related Tonight's TV schedule Email to a Friend Your Email Address: * Your Name: * To Email Address: * Message: * * Please separate multiple email addresses with the semi-colon character.

Sep 30th 2016, 6:03 AM 24,122 Views 31 Comments Share1906 Tweet Email Image: Shutterstock/Steve Cordory THEY’VE BEEN BANNED in a number of countries, and now it looks like microbeads are set for the chopping block in Ireland – if the Dáil agrees to pass a new bill tabled by the Green Party. The tiny plastic beads, present in many cosmetic products, are not biodegradable and can affect marine life. What are microbeads? Microbeads are tiny balls of plastic – smaller than 5mm but usually between 0.0004-1.24 mm wide – which are most common in soaps, shower gels and facial scrubs, used to exfoliate your skin. They are also found in some toothpastes and abrasive cleaners. Back in 2014, An Taisce called for a “quick phase out” of microbeads, saying that the beads are absorbed or eaten by sea creatures and could potentially be absorbed by humans. They also contribute to the so-called ‘plastic soup’ that has accumulated in the world’s oceans. The Pacific Ocean, for example, is home to a patch of rubbish made of plastic, known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Plastic debris is capable of being broken down into tiny particles which might be ingested by sea animals and birds. Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch=azwKxDVGmns&t=) Source: National Science Foundation/YouTube A site called Beat the Microbead outlines the types of products that contain microbeads. It notes that Unilever announced in 2012 that all of its products worldwide would be plastic-free by 2015, that Proctor and Gamble said it would be microbead-free by 2017, and that Johnson and Johnson has already started phasing out microbeads. A list of other companies that have pledged to get rid of microbeads can be found here. Climate Change Minister Denis Naughten said on Morning Ireland that he is aware the EU has been discussing tackling the issue of microbeads. It’s a huge and growing problem, not just in this country but internationally. The EU is also looking at this issue. I think there is a role for the EU in relation to this but in Ireland as well, to look at banning microbeads getting into our water systems because they’re having a huge impact in relation to our fish stocks, and in relation to our clean water standards. He made the comments as he was on his way to speak with other climate ministers from OECD countries this week. British MPs recently said that a worldwide ban of microbeads in cosmetics should be enforced as soon as possible. The chair of Britain’s Environmental Audit Committee, Mary Creagh, told the BBC that a single shower can result in 100,000 plastic particles entering the ocean. Plans to ban I just spoke in the #Seanad about new @greenparty_ie legislation to get #microbead plastic pollution out of our seas https://t.co/2JZX9uwCV1— Grace O'Sullivan (@SenGraceOSllvn) September 28, 2016 Source: Grace O'Sullivan/Twitter The Department for Housing, Planning and Local Government said last month that Ireland supports “the principle of banning of microbeads”. It also said that a timeframe is needed before a blanket ban is introduced so that the “industry has time to adapt”. However, the Green Party published legislation this week to ban microbeads, called the Micro-Plastic and Micro-Bead Pollution Prevention Bill 2016. The bill would prohibit the manufacture and sale of products containing microbeads and the addition of microbeads to cosmetics, soaps or similar products. It would also create an offence of sale or manufacture of such products and provides for a fine on prosecution of up to €10,000 for each item for sale, sold, or manufactured. Under the legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would be responsible for monitoring the levels of microbeads in Irish waters. Green Party Senator Grace O’Sullivan said that the bill is on its way as the party is concerned about the long-term public health implications of micro-beads. “The US has already banned them, the UK are beginning a process to do so, and even Cosmetics Europe, the industry lobby in the EU, have recommended they be phased out,” she pointed out. “We’ve had legislation ready on banning micro-beads for a while, and we’re publishing it in light of Minister Naughten’s comments. We welcome that the Government are considering such a ban.” She added: There are a huge amount of products, such as facial scrubs, soaps, and toothpaste that contain thousands of plastic microbeads. These are flushed down drains and make their way into the environment. Many of these microbeads are too small to be filtered out during ordinary wastewater treatment, and end up in our rivers, lakes and seas. These beads are then ingested by fish and other marine organisms. Once ingested, these micro-beads attract other pollutants, many of which are recognised to have serious impacts on human health. These toxins accumulate in fish, and can be passed on to humans who eat them. Senator O’Sullivan said that the party is sure there will be cross-party support on this bill. Microbeads and water Ervia said that microbeads would most likely end up in surface water after going down the plughole, but “it is likely there would be considerable removal of these beads during the settlement process in typical wastewater treatment plants”. “Any concentration of microbeads that do enter a surface water course and are abstracted into drinking water treatment process, would be subjected to coagulation, flocculation and filtration processes which would most likely remove any remaining concentration of microbeads to trace levels.” Ireland is working with European partner countries under the Oslo-Paris Convention (OSPAR) on studying the effectiveness of wastewater treatment plants and storm drainage in removing plastics. The country is also undertaking national research on the effectiveness of indigenous urban wastewater facilities in removal of these materials. The Department of Environment said that “it is considered that unilateral action by individual countries may have a limited effect in this area and that a coordinated approach is required”. Consequently, The Marine Strategy Framework Directive is the overarching legislative context that covers marine litter in the European context. Also in the international domain, research undertaken under OSPAR on micro plastics will form the basis for future developments on the issue of removal of the microbeads from products. It added that it is envisaged that a full consultation process would be undertaken, including key stakeholders in the environmental science, public health and industrial sectors as well as the general public.

However, no matter what the age, the 27-year-old - who first found fame in S Club Juniors - has opened up about how she has learned to deal with a very modern phenomena: online trolls. Speaking exclusively to the MailOnline, The Saturdays star revealed it's impossible to get away from people's opinions, but even so, she's glad to be to 'connected' with her fans. Scroll down for video  Thick skin: Frankie Bridge - who first found fame in S Club Juniors - has opened up about the thick skin she has had to grow with the emergence of online trolls on social media She shared: 'When I started out there was no social media, I didn’t know if people didn’t like my hair or my outfit, but now, with social media, you can’t get away from people’s opinion.  'Its great in so many ways as it keeps you so much more connected to fans and you get to share so much more.'

Share this article Share Although happy to have an outlet to chat with her fans, the brunette beauty - who first rose to fame in 2001 - opened up about the darkside of being online while launching the Superdrug and P&G #FeelSuper Campaign. Speaking about nasty online trolls, Frankie insisted she's learned to be 'thick skinned' about the negative commentary that comes with being a person in the public eye on social media.   'But it also means you can see negative comments,' she added. 'I’ve learnt to be thick skinned about these things but I totally understand why you would feel really hurt by things trolls say.' 'I’ve recently been talking about this a lot and the response has been really positive.' The music starlet has taken cyber bullying into her own hands recently - having appeared on BBC and Chanel 5 discussing the topic - going in search of internet haters. She continued: 'Everyone knows what it’s like to some extent to have someone say something bad about you and it’s a topic that is really in the public eye right now. 'What was so interesting about the documentary was to actually track down and talk to the trolls behind the nasty comments as you realise they are just normal people and nothing to be scared of or upset by.'  'Not date night kind of people': Opening up about injecting some romance into their relationship, Frankie admitted they're not 'date night kind of people' (pictured with Wayne in 2015) When not hunting down cyber bullies, the proud mum-of-two - Carter, one, and Parker, two - is keeping the spark alive in her marriage to former Reading footballer Wayne Bridge, 36. The songstress wed the sports star in Woburn Abbey, Bedfordshire in 2014 after nearly fours years of dating. Opening up about injecting some romance into their relationship, Frankie admitted they're not 'date night kind of people' but gushed about what a great father he is to their young boys - who in her eyes are growing up 'too fast'.   'We’re not date night kind of people but we do try and take an hour a day to spend time with each other,' she revealed. 'He’s a great dad and just watching him play with the boys and raising them into amazing young people is so special. Daddy day care: Frankie couldn't help but gush about what a great father he is to their young boys - Carter and Parker 'But if we do have time we might go for a nice meal or to the cinema.'  She continued: 'I’m lucky that I get to spend a lot of time with the boys, and with Wayne too! We’re always all together which is great.  'Parker will be 3 this year which is scary, it might sound clichéd but they really do grow up too fast!!' Mammy's boys: The pop star couldn't help but say her little tots are growing up 'too fast' The pop star was on hand to launch the #FeelSuperSalon in London's Soho on Thursday as part of #FeelSuper campaign from P&G and Superdrug. The initiative aims to raise £200,000 for the Marie Curie charity, the UK's leading charity caring for people living with any terminal illness.  A donation is made to the charity every time a P&G product is bought in store at Superdrug or on their online outlet from September 21 to October 18.  Speaking about the worthwhile campaign, Frankie said: 'Marie Curie is a really special charity which I’ve supported for many years.  'The challenging work the nurses do is amazing and its been such a privilege to spend time with them during this campaign seeing this first hand.'  Giving back: The pop star was on hand to launch the #FeelSuperSalon in London's Soho on Thursday as part of #FeelSuper campaign from P&G and Superdrug  Worthwhile: The initiative aims to raise £200,000 for the Marie Curie charity, the UK's leading charity caring for people living with any terminal illness Read more: Marie Curie | Care and support through terminal illness Share or comment on this article e-mail 6 shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

For well over 150 years, Folgers has been delivering ground, whole-bean, instant, and home-brew coffees to millions of sleepy consumers. Check out some facts on the company's history, from their origins in whaling to some unfortunate run-ins with Charles Manson and snapping turtles. 1. THE FAMILY WAS NAME-DROPPED IN MOBY-DICK. For centuries, the Folger clan of Nantucket was renowned for their whaling efforts. (Oil from whale blubber was often used for lamps until kerosene grew in popularity.) They were so well known that author Herman Melville referred to "a long line of Folgers and harpooneers" in his classic Moby-Dick. 2. THE COMPANY WAS FOUNDED THANKS TO THE GOLD RUSH. Folgers James Folger was just 15 years old when his parents dispatched him and two older brothers to San Francisco to mine for gold in 1849. As plans go, it wasn’t a great one: the Folger boys didn’t have enough money to travel to the mining areas, so James stayed behind to earn some cash. He wound up working for the Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills company, which was marketing an early, commercially roasted ground coffee. Two decades later, James returned—this time with more cash—and bought the business, renaming it J.A. Folger & Co. in 1872. 3. MAXWELL HOUSE WAS AN EARLY NEMESIS. After decades of being a regional favorite, Folgers was purchased by Procter & Gamble in 1963 and quickly became part of the national competition for store-bought coffee brands. Wary of giving up any ground, Maxwell House formed an in-house "Folgers Defense Team" in 1971. The result: Horizon, a coffee that came in a red can similar to Folgers, and a television commercial character named Aunt Cora (played by Margaret Hamilton, the Wicked Witch from 1939’s The Wizard of Oz). Cora was meant to be a take on Folgers’ Mrs. Olson (see below), with the hope that if Maxwell House ran the commercials in regions early enough, Olson would seem like a second-rate take-off. Folgers was forced to lower their price from $1.20 to 87 cents per can just to remain competitive. By 1979, however, they had taken over 26.5 percent of the market share, well ahead of Maxwell House’s 22.3 percent. 4. EARLY COMMERCIALS WERE NOT VERY PC. While Folgers has a history of memorable television spots, their most enduring ad campaign revolved around a Swedish character named Mrs. Olson, who appeared to keep busy by introducing Folgers coffee to her overworked neighbors in a series of pretty sexist ads in the 1950s and 1960s. (Folgers conducted research into how petulant the onscreen husbands could get and found housewives considered any kind of verbal abuse so typical as to be acceptable.) Virginia Christine, who portrayed Olson for 21 years, was born in Stanton, Iowa in 1920. When the ads grew popular, the town renovated its trademark water tower so it resembled a coffee pot in her honor. 5. THEY HAVE A LINK TO THE MANSON MURDERS. One of the 20th century’s most infamous crimes was the murder of Sharon Tate and four of her houseguests in 1969 by disciples of cult leader Charles Manson. Among the victims: Abigail Folger, the 25-year-old Folger fortune heiress, daughter of Peter Folger and great-granddaughter of founder James Folger.  (Manson and his cohorts were convicted of first-degree murder in 1971.) 6. THE "PETER" COMMERCIAL RAN FOR OVER 17 YEARS. You’ll know it when you see it: in the 1986 television spot, a college student named Peter gets dropped off at the family home in a Volkswagen Beetle and surreptitiously makes coffee for his sleeping parents with the help of his younger sister. It’s a cozy little bit, and consumers responded so strongly that Folgers ran the ad for 17 consecutive years. Greg Wrangler, who played the coffee-making intruder, told BrandLandUSA.com in 2008 that producers wanted it to be timeless. "I remember they were really concerned about the look of the spot," he said. "I’m referring to their choices on wardrobe … the Irish wool sweater, the VW Beetle that drops me off … they didn’t want it to be dated … which I think was a big factor in their ability to run it for so long." 7. A WOMAN FOUND A SNAPPING TURTLE IN ONE CAN. A lot of coffee comes into the United States via New Orleans, which is why 2005’s Hurricane Katrina resulted in a marked disruption of supply. The natural disaster may have had other side effects: According to the Associated Press, Marjorie Morris of Ainsworth, Iowa found a dead baby snapping turtle in her can of Folgers. While no harm came to Morris, she was dismayed by her timing: the 77-year-old had been using the can for a month before spotting the added ingredient. 8. THEY CAME UP WITH SOME PRETTY CLEVER MANHOLE COVER ADS. John Morton via Flickr // CC BY-SA 2.0 In 2006, Folgers garnered some positive PR when they used foot-proof signage to cover manholes in New York City and made them resemble hot cups of coffee, complete with steam emitting from holes in the cover. While clever, the stunt had an unintended side effect: the aroma from the sewers was not what you’d normally associate with coffee.  9. THEY’RE PRETTY TIGHT WITH DUNKIN’. Folgers was acquired by the J.M. Smucker company in 2008, putting it under the same corporate umbrella as the Dunkin' Donuts retail license. Together, the two home coffee brands made $577 million for the company in the second quarter of 2016 alone.

Procter and Gamble the manufacturer of Always Brand, announced the start of the always keeping girls in school program in Nyeri which will see over 800 girls receive a year's supply of sanitary pads.PHOTO;KIBATA KIHU/STANDARD More than 800 girls will receive a year's supply of sanitary pads and underwear. The initiative is as a result of a partnership between governor Nderitu Gachagua's wife Margaret and consumer goods manufacturer, Proctor and Gamble (P&G). P&G, the maker of Always, announced Thursday that it would provide the essential commodity to girls from vulnerable backgrounds under its 'Always Keeping Girls in School Programme. The company hopes to keep more than 12,000 girls in school, many of whom cannot afford the sanitary pads and have to stay away from school during their menstruation. Girls from poor backgrounds and rural areas lose 25 per cent of their school time during their periods. Share this story: Related Are your sanitary products causing that itch?

Home About Us The Catholic Free Press Mission Friends of The Free Press Who’s Who Photo Galleries Contact Us Subscribe to Catholic Free Press Advertise with The Catholic Free Press Order Diocesan Directory Links Sep 16 TV star Frank Runyeon imparts lessons in Blackstone Posted By The Catholic Free Press September 16, 2016 | 4:39 pm | Featured Article #2 Facebook0 Twitter0 Pinterest0 Google+0 LinkedIn0 By Tanya Connor | The Catholic Free Press BLACKSTONE – God should be at the center, but he’s been cut out of life. That makes it harder to teach the faith. This message was communicated Sunday, Sept. 11, when television star Frank Runyeon spoke to religious education students, teachers and parents at St. Theresa Parish. But then he showed how children can make a difference. Mr. Runyeon has translated and adapted biblical texts for his one-man dramas, including “Luke: Stories on the Road,” which he presented Tuesday, Sept. 13, for a parish mission here, and “The Letter of James: What are you doing?” presented Wednesday. Sunday he performed “Salt and Light” for grades 1-5, and talked to grades 6-10 about “Hollywood versus Faith.” Mr. Runyeon’s familiar with the actor’s world. He starred for seven years on “As the World Turns” and for four years on the Emmy-award-winning “Santa Barbara,” according to his website. He’s also acted in other shows and hosted his own radio talk show. On Sunday he offered glimpses behind the scenes, recounting how he was told he hadn’t been hired to do quality acting or present life as it is, but to “sell soap.” (Soap-maker Procter and Gamble sponsored soap operas, advertising its products.) News broadcasts too are designed to “get you to sit through the commercials,” and begin with the bloodiest story, Mr. Runyeon said. And entertainment focuses on violence and death “so you stop for a second, like (at) a terrible accident.” Often when they are facing hardships, people bargain with God, he said. But filmmakers don’t usually show characters talking to God because people disagree about God, he said. And, in public school, people are not to talk about God, he said. But you can’t put God to the side, because what is in the center of your life becomes your god, he explained. He also drew other contrasts between screen and scriptural values. In commercials one is told that happiness comes from buying things, but Jesus says, “Sell all your stuff.” (Mt 19:21) Females are told happiness is in how they look, so they focus on weight loss, sometimes nearly killing themselves. But St. Paul said, “Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit” (I Cor 6:19). The culture emphasizes winning, Mr. Runyeon noted. Students are pushed to get As, so they think losing is the worst thing, he said, telling of a student who hung himself because he only heard the story “out there” in the world. The story in church might not seem as enticing, “it just happens to be the truth,” he said. It’s about relationships with people and, most importantly, God. He urged listeners, “Have a relationship with the One who is the truth.” “It’s actually pretty true,” Allison Sawyer, 13, said of Mr. Runyeon’s talk, adding that youth are pressured to get good grades. She said maybe teachers or parents should tell them not to worry; they will still get a house and a job. “I thought it was really inspiring,” said Toni Marino, 13. “It made sense, why all the movies have pretty girls in them.” The talk helped her understand why pretty girls get everything they want, and others don’t, she said. She said now she’ll question things, not just assume they’re true. “We just need people that are able to communicate the message,” said her father, John Marino, a confirmation teacher. “He gives teachers and educators a lot of good talking points.… It reminded me that we have to encourage these kids not to just listen to what’s being fed them (but) to question everything that they see.” Mr. Runyeon helped parents understand why there’s a disconnect for youth when they’re taught about the faith, he said. He said adults are quick to judge and simply tell students to pay attention. “I wished I could do that for my students – what he did for me,” said Deborah Champeau, a grade 8 religious education teacher born in 1951. “It’s not that complicated … God at the center of everything. We grew up in a different time.… All of my friends – God was a part of their lives.” Now, she said, Catholicism is like a second language that seems irrelevant to students. Mr. Runyeon used drama to make Scripture relevant to students in grades 1-5. Like an actor’s script, Scripture “tells us the part we’re supposed to play,” he said. Dramatizing Jesus’ “riddles” – “You are the salt of the earth” and “You are the light of the world” – Mr. Runyeon pretended young listeners were a salt shaker and a light bulb. He said people are like salt when they bring out the goodness in others and keep things from going bad. They are like light when they show others the right way to go. Mr. Runyeon incorporated these challenges into his dramatization of King Herod’s birthday party, at which Herod made a rash promise to the dancer, which led to the killing of John the Baptist (Mk 6:14-29). “John the Baptist died,” Mr. Runyeon said. “That’s what can happen when we forget to be salt and light.” But he said there was a happy ending – John went to heaven. “Do you know we really do have a King, and we’re in the court of our King right now?” Mr. Runyeon asked. He had listeners put their hands on their hearts, face the tabernacle and sing, to the tune of “Happy Birthday,”: “I’ll be salt for you. I’ll be salt for you. I’ll be salt not pepper.

The Patanjali Food and Herbal Park at Haridwar - Photo: Kamal Narang September 29, 2016:   Of gurus and grassroots Why is Patanjali such a success in India? I hear the company has ₹5,000 crore in revenue? Mumbai Mini, Patanjali Ayurved has taken baby steps in reaching Ayurveda and ayurvedic products to consumers in India and the Indian diaspora over the last decade. Its products are basic (except for noodles, which jolts me, frankly speaking), of robust quality, functional and priced just right. The brands, in all their rusticity, do a fair bit of un-branding to categories that require un-branding, such as FMCG products of the basic kind. FMCG offerings were pioneered by local players, who were then overtaken by foreign multinational companies (Unilever and Procter & Gamble, for example), and then by Indian MNCs with big aspirations (like ITC), and finally followed by the “Baba companies” such as the one Patanjali Ayurved represents. Over each phase, basic FMCG offerings have strived to shed the commodity nature by hiking prices and imagery, and product compositions have gone as inorganic as they can. The Baba companies, led by Patanjali, for now, re-invent the commodity once again, with a holistic spin. And lo and behold, you have a very no-frills offering that promises the good old way of healthy living with healthy options. The price label is a further dose of consumer delight. Patanjali’s success is intrinsically attached to Baba Ramdev. He is not a passive guru. Add to it the fact that he wears saffron, a colour that’s the flavour of the decade in India today. Controversy is his middle name. He is often aggressive, and wears his heart on his sleeve. This endears him to a large part of the masses who will be his consumers. Patanjali Ayurved without Baba Ramdev is just another company. The company has set off shivers in corporate boardrooms in India. And rightfully so. Companies such as Dabur and Himalaya have offered ayurvedic products for long. How come their imagery is not as hot as Patanjali Ayurved? New Delhi Jolly, products that come with a spiritual guru as its brand endorser at the top do better in this category. The idea is a simple one. This is not a corporate product, it is one put together with the care and supervision of a Guru. That seems to work in India. Small is beautiful and big is routine. This is why Patanjali Ayurved with Baba Ramdev does better than the Baidyanaths and Daburs of the world in terms of imagery.

REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo LONDON GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) has promoted a former Novartis (NOVN.S) executive to lead its consumer healthcare business, following the appointment last week of the unit's previous head, Emma Walmsley, as CEO designate of the drugmaker. The British group said on Thursday that Brian McNamara, 50, who currently heads up Europe and the Americas at GSK Consumer Healthcare, would take on his new role immediately and join GSK's corporate executive team. McNamara worked for 11 years at Novartis, where he was also in charge of consumer health, and joined GSK following the creation of a joint venture between the two companies in 2015. Prior to that he spent 16 years at Procter & Gamble (PG.N). The swift management transition will ensure the consumer business remains focused on improving financial performance and will allow Walmsley to focus on her new role as incoming CEO, a spokesman said. She will officially take the helm at the end of March on the retirement of current CEO Andrew Witty, becoming the first woman to lead a top global drugmaker. Separately, GSK said it had disposed of the final portion of its stake in Aspen Pharmacare (APNJ.J), Africa’s biggest generic drugmaker, after seven years as an investor in the company. Its gross proceeds from the sale of the remaining 6.2 percent holding were 477 million pounds ($621 million).

It is now a short and I am going to take the trade. I have been patiently watching this stock chart, waiting for this to happen. It did today. A gap fill on a stock chart is one of the highest percentage plays available to stock chart traders. In this case, price moved higher into the gap fill which is major resistance. Price should fall back now, and trade lower. The downside target is $84 then $75. This article was written by Jenny Rebekka for on .

U.S. stocks are falling Monday morning and following Asian and European indexes lower. (AP Photo/Richard US stocks are bouncing back Friday morning after a steep loss late the previous day. Strong earnings from Costco are giving consumer stocks a lift. Banks, too, are recovering from a sharp drop as Deutsche Bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Energy companies are also trading higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 117 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 18,260 as of 10:10 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 10 points, or 0.5 per cent, to 2,161. The Nasdaq composite rose 19 points, or 0.4 per cent, to 5,288. BANKS BOUNCE BACK: Banks made some of the largest gains. The stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon as investors again worried about the health of Deutsche Bank, the largest lender in Germany, following reports that some hedge funds are moving their business out of the bank. Late Thursday CEO John Cryan tried to calm investors. In a letter to Deutsche Bank employees, he said the bank has $241 billion in reserves and is meeting its capital requirements. Deutsche Bank's U.S.-listed stock rose 71 cents, or 6.2 per cent, to $12.20. Its stock has been pummeled this year and is trading at all-time lows. Among US banks, JPMorgan Chase added 68 cents, or 1 per cent, to $66.33 and Citigroup gained 61 cents, or 1.3 per cent, to $46.41. OIL: Benchmark US crude rose 7 cents to $47.90 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international benchmark, remained at $49.81 a barrel in London. Oil prices have surged this week after the nations of Opec, which collectively produce more than third of the world's oil, agreed to a small cut in production in a surprise decision. While the gains for oil prices have slowed, investors were still optimistic that energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Hess jumped 87 cents, or 1.7 per cent, to $53.02 and Spectra Energy rose 67 cents, or 1.6 per cent, to $42.99. Continued below.

BIG SALE: Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.65, or 3.8 per cent, to $153.14 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.37, or 1.6 per cent, to $89.60 and Wal-Mart rose $1.29, or 1.8 per cent, to $72.02. CHIPPING IN: Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors continued to climb on reports the companies might combine. The Wall Street Journal said Qualcomm is in talks to buy its rival, and NXP gained $6.37, or 6.6 per cent, to $102.49 and Qualcomm picked up $1.95, or 2.9 per cent, to $69.40.That followed a bigger move a day ago. COGNIZANT CEO: Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the technology consulting company said President Gordon Coburn resigned. It named Rajeev Mahta, the former head of its IT Services business, as its new president. The stock fell $7.47, or 13.6 per cent, to $47.53. More Economy The Economy Hub Business Videos Business Toolbox More Liam Dann TECH TRIUMPHANT: Major stock indexes set records this quarter, and tech stocks were by far the biggest reason.

Column: Barbarian at the gate 1:32 p.m. EDT September 30, 2016 James E. Baker Community Press guest columnist In the first presidential debate, we saw what the Cincinnati Enquirer, Arizona Republic and Dallas Morning News saw when they changed their long-held political opinions and endorsed Hillary Clinton, saying that Donald Trump was unfit to be president. Clinton looked positively “presidential,” while Trump constantly “sniffed,” drank water, made faces, leaned on the podium and insisted in interrupting both Clinton and the moderator with hysterical shouts and screams. “The Donald” was a train wreck and gave the performance of a baffoon. Talking about “stamina,” Clinton had all the stamina. Trump desperately needed to blow his nose, as his sniffing was interfering with his speech. His constant drinking indicated that he was very frightened and upset. He was losing the debate in every area. He has no definitive plan for any problem; he is lazy; he was unprepared, and he cannot focus. His tax strategy only benefits the upper 5 percent of income earners, it will create about $4 trillion in new debt, making it very difficult to pay our debts and repair our infrastructure. He was not specific about how he would retain or attract jobs for the United States. Trump kept harping on reducing taxes, which he claimed, would generate millions of new jobs. Our last experiment with this approach failed. Lower taxes to the bottom 90 percent do increase jobs, as they spend it all, increasing the economy. Trump blamed Clinton for being totally out of control. It was he who was totally out of control throughout the entire debate. Donald was rude, crude, argumentative, wrong on a number of comments, and easily rattled…he “choked,” using his own vernacular. Trump’s performance was straight out of the sixth-grade. His constantly changing facial grimaces were those of a sixth-grade boy. Only 5 percent of you have the wealth to afford to vote Republican. None of their policies will put a dime in your pocket. In fact, their health care proposal will cost you a fortune. Trump wants to repeal Obamacare with absolutely nothing to replace it, except the old private health policies that contain exclusions, caps on coverage and pre-existing conditions. Even if you work for GE or P&G, your cost of a private policy will be unaffordable. This country needs Medicare-for-all. It is cheap, efficient, and it eliminates the insurance companies that, over several decades, have stolen the practice of medicine from doctors. This saves about 25 percent on health care. Medicare administration costs are less than 2 percent . Republican refusal to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices is a needless cost to old people and all taxpayers. A Republican Congress will not raise the minimum wage; Congress has received nine wage increases since the last minimum wage increase. Republicans will not allow equal pay for women. If you are a 10-year old rape victim, Republicans want to force you to carry the baby to term and give birth. This is insane. Vote straight Democrat, even for dogcatcher. James Baker is a 39-year resident of Indian Hill. 3 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2dKYMI9 TOP VIDEOS Joe Deters: "I didn't believe the tears for a second" 2:47 Are deals better on Black Friday or Cyber Monday? 1:00 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 Predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 Student at UC Tensing forum: 'It's time for war' 0:45 Sam DuBose sister: 'This, to me, is murder' 1:30 Protests in Cincinnati after Ray Tensing mistrial 1:09 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Mistrial declared in Ray Tensing case 3:46 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 More Stories Deters: Tensing jury 'straw poll' unanimous for murder Nov. 17, 2016, 7:39 p.m.

Strong earnings from Costco are giving consumer stocks a lift. Banks, too, are recovering from a sharp drop as Deutsche Bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Energy companies are also trading higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 117 points, or 0.6 percent, to 18,260 as of 10:10 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 10 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,161. The Nasdaq composite rose 19 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,288. BANKS BOUNCE BACK: Banks made some of the largest gains. The stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon as investors again worried about the health of Deutsche Bank, the largest lender in Germany, following reports that some hedge funds are moving their business out of the bank. Late Thursday CEO John Cryan tried to calm investors. In a letter to Deutsche Bank employees, he said the bank has $241 billion in reserves and is meeting its capital requirements. Deutsche Bank's U.S.-listed stock rose 71 cents, or 6.2 percent, to $12.20. Its stock has been pummeled this year and is trading at all-time lows. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added 68 cents, or 1 percent, to $66.33 and Citigroup gained 61 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $46.41. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 7 cents to $47.90 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international benchmark, remained at $49.81 a barrel in London. Oil prices have surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than third of the world's oil, agreed to a small cut in production in a surprise decision. While the gains for oil prices have slowed, investors were still optimistic that energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Hess jumped 87 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $53.02 and Spectra Energy rose 67 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $42.99. BIG SALE: Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.65, or 3.8 percent, to $153.14 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.37, or 1.6 percent, to $89.60 and Wal-Mart rose $1.29, or 1.8 percent, to $72.02. CHIPPING IN: Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors continued to climb on reports the companies might combine. The Wall Street Journal said Qualcomm is in talks to buy its rival, and NXP gained $6.37, or 6.6 percent, to $102.49 and Qualcomm picked up $1.95, or 2.9 percent, to $69.40.That followed a bigger move a day ago. COGNIZANT CEO: Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the technology consulting company said President Gordon Coburn resigned. It named Rajeev Mahta, the former head of its IT Services business, as its new president. The stock fell $7.47, or 13.6 percent, to $47.53. TECH TRIUMPHANT: Major stock indexes set records this quarter, and tech stocks were by far the biggest reason. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 12 percent over the last three months, its best result since the end of 2013. Apple surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Apple is the most valuable publicly-traded company in the world. The second-largest tech company, Microsoft, is up 12 percent this quarter and Google parent Alphabet leaped 14 percent. BONDS: Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 1.56 percent. CURRENCIES: The dollar rose to 101.21 yen from 101.07 yen. The euro remained at $1.1216. OVERSEAS: Britain's FTSE 100 fell 1.1 percent while France's CAC 40 sank 1.7 percent and Germany's DAX lost 1.6 percent. Japan's Nikkei 225 slumped 1.5 percent and South Korea's Kospi fell 1.2 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index sank 1.9 percent.

U.S. stocks are bouncing back early Friday, Sept. 30, 2016, after a steep loss late the previous day. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........NEW YORK — U.S. stocks climbed Friday as banks made a rapid recovery following a steep fall a day ago. Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains Friday as Germany’s largest bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the massive cost of settling a U.S. investigation into mortgage securities. Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued to move higher, and strong earnings from Costco sent consumer stocks higher. Deutsche Bank is the largest lender in Germany, and investors are concerned about not only its plunging stock price, but the potential effect on the financial system if Deutsche Bank gets into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Those fears faded on Friday. “People came to the realization that this isn’t likely to be a big systemic risk that ripples through the financial sector,” said Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management.

The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rebounded 17.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,312. The Department of Justice wants Deutsche Bank to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into mortgage-backed securities, and the stock jumped Friday after a report that the bank could settle the case with a smaller payment. Deutsche Bank’s U.S.-listed stock rose $1.61, or 14 percent, to $13.09. The stock has been pummeled this year and is trading near all-time lows. Financial stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon following reports that some hedge funds were moving their business out of Deutsche Bank. On Friday, bank stocks and the broader market regained almost all of those losses. Thooft said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are causes for concern, including the health of Italy’s banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and regulation getting tighter, there are plenty of reasons for investors to avoid bank stocks. That didn’t stop the financial sector, the weakest sector in the market this year, from rallying on Friday. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added 94 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $66.59 and Citigroup gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $47.23. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world’s oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. Investors hope energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.65, or 1.6 percent, to $102.92 and EOG Resources rose $1.66, or 1.7 percent, to $96.71. Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.02, or 3.4 percent, to $152.51 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.52, or 1.7 percent, to $89.75 and Wal-Mart rose $1.39, or 2 percent, to $72.12.

Cognizant said it’s looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has informed the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant also said its president Gordon Coburn resigned. The stock fell $7.37, or 13.4 percent, to $47.63. Major stock indexes set records this quarter thanks mostly to tech stocks. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 12 percent over the last three months. Apple, the most valuable company in the S&P 500, surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Microsoft, the next-largest company, rose 13 percent and another tech giant, Google parent Alphabet, leaped 14 percent. Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.60 percent from 1.56 percent. Stocks that pay high dividends, like utilities and real estate and phone companies, traded lower. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline picked up 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Natural gas slipped 5 cents to $2.91 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $8.90 to $1,317.10 an ounce. Silver rose 3 cents to $19.21 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.21 a pound. The dollar rose to 101.41 yen from 101.07 yen. The euro rose to $1.1237 from $1.1216. Germany’s DAX climbed 1 percent and France’s CAC 40 added 0.1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain lost 0.3 percent. Major indexes in Asia slumped on concerns about the banking industry. Japan’s Nikkei 225 slumped 1.5 percent and South Korea’s Kospi fell 1.2 percent.

AP photo US stocks rebound as consumer companies and banks rise (10:22 a.m.) By: The Associated Press September 30, 2016 Comments Off on US stocks rebound as consumer companies and banks rise (10:22 a.m.) U.S. stocks are bouncing back Friday morning after a steep loss late the previous day. Strong earnings from Costco are giving consumer stocks a lift. Banks, too, are recovering from a sharp drop as Deutsche Bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Energy companies are also trading higher. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 117 points, or 0.6 percent, to 18,260 as of 10:10 a.m. Eastern time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index picked up 10 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,161. The Nasdaq composite rose 19 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,288. BANKS BOUNCE BACK: Banks made some of the largest gains. The stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon as investors again worried about the health of Deutsche Bank, the largest lender in Germany, following reports that some hedge funds are moving their business out of the bank. Late Thursday CEO John Cryan tried to calm investors. In a letter to Deutsche Bank employees, he said the bank has $241 billion in reserves and is meeting its capital requirements. Deutsche Bank’s U.S.-listed stock rose 71 cents, or 6.2 percent, to $12.20. Its stock has been pummeled this year and is trading at all-time lows. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added 68 cents, or 1 percent, to $66.33 and Citigroup gained 61 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $46.41. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude rose 7 cents to $47.90 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, the international benchmark, remained at $49.81 a barrel in London. Oil prices have surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than third of the world’s oil, agreed to a small cut in production in a surprise decision. While the gains for oil prices have slowed, investors were still optimistic that energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Hess jumped 87 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $53.02 and Spectra Energy rose 67 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $42.99. BIG SALE: Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.65, or 3.8 percent, to $153.14 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.37, or 1.6 percent, to $89.60 and Wal-Mart rose $1.29, or 1.8 percent, to $72.02. CHIPPING IN: Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors continued to climb on reports the companies might combine. The Wall Street Journal said Qualcomm is in talks to buy its rival, and NXP gained $6.37, or 6.6 percent, to $102.49 and Qualcomm picked up $1.95, or 2.9 percent, to $69.40.That followed a bigger move a day ago. COGNIZANT CEO: Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the technology consulting company said President Gordon Coburn resigned. It named Rajeev Mahta, the former head of its IT Services business, as its new president. The stock fell $7.47, or 13.6 percent, to $47.53. TECH TRIUMPHANT: Major stock indexes set records this quarter, and tech stocks were by far the biggest reason. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 12 percent over the last three months, its best result since the end of 2013. Apple surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Apple is the most valuable publicly-traded company in the world. The second-largest tech company, Microsoft, is up 12 percent this quarter and Google parent Alphabet leaped 14 percent. BONDS: Bond prices were little changed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 1.56 percent.

Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains Friday as Germany's largest bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the massive cost of settling a U.S. investigation into mortgage securities. Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued to move higher, and strong earnings from Costco sent consumer stocks higher. Deutsche Bank is the largest lender in Germany, and investors are concerned about not only its plunging stock price, but the potential effect on the financial system if Deutsche Bank gets into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Those fears faded on Friday. FILE - In this Monday, Sept. 26, 2016, file photo, traders Kevin Lodewick, left, and Richard Cohen work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks are bouncing back early Friday, Sept. 30, 2016, after a steep loss late the previous day. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) "People came to the realization that this isn't likely to be a big systemic risk that ripples through the financial sector," said Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rebounded 17.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,312. The Department of Justice wants Deutsche Bank to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into mortgage-backed securities, and the stock jumped Friday after a report that the bank could settle the case with a smaller payment. Deutsche Bank's U.S.-listed stock rose $1.61, or 14 percent, to $13.09. The stock has been pummeled this year and is trading near all-time lows. Financial stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon following reports that some hedge funds were moving their business out of Deutsche Bank. On Friday, bank stocks and the broader market regained almost all of those losses. Thooft said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are causes for concern, including the health of Italy's banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and regulation getting tighter, there are plenty of reasons for investors to avoid bank stocks. That didn't stop the financial sector, the weakest sector in the market this year, from rallying on Friday. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added 94 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $66.59 and Citigroup gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $47.23. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world's oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. Investors hope energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.65, or 1.6 percent, to $102.92 and EOG Resources rose $1.66, or 1.7 percent, to $96.71. Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.02, or 3.4 percent, to $152.51 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.52, or 1.7 percent, to $89.75 and Wal-Mart rose $1.39, or 2 percent, to $72.12. Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the information technology consulting and outsourcing firm said it's investigating possible bribes paid to officials in India. Cognizant said it's looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has informed the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant also said its president Gordon Coburn resigned. The stock fell $7.37, or 13.4 percent, to $47.63. Major stock indexes set records this quarter thanks mostly to tech stocks. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 12 percent over the last three months. Apple, the most valuable company in the S&P 500, surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Microsoft, the next-largest company, rose 13 percent and another tech giant, Google parent Alphabet, leaped 14 percent. Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.60 percent from 1.56 percent. Stocks that pay high dividends, like utilities and real estate and phone companies, traded lower. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline picked up 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Natural gas slipped 5 cents to $2.91 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $8.90 to $1,317.10 an ounce. Silver rose 3 cents to $19.21 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.21 a pound. The dollar rose to 101.41 yen from 101.07 yen. The euro rose to $1.1237 from $1.1216. Germany's DAX climbed 1 percent and France's CAC 40 added 0.1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain lost 0.3 percent. Major indexes in Asia slumped on concerns about the banking industry. Japan's Nikkei 225 slumped 1.5 percent and South Korea's Kospi fell 1.2 percent. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index sank 1.9 percent. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay Share or comment on this article e-mail Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Clorox is a well-diversified company that seems to be firing on all cylinders -- but is its price tag too high to make this a good investment? Seth McNew (TMFMcNew) Sep 29, 2016 at 10:00AM Image source: The Clorox Company. The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) has been a great investment over the last few decades, and could continue to be due to its brand strength, impressive earnings growth, and increasing dividend. But at 25 times earnings, is the stock too expensive? Clorox segment and brand strength  This century-old company is a lot more than just the home-cleaning brand its name suggests, offering nearly 20 brands such as Glad and Burt's Bees. Most of the company's growth comes through acquisitions, which is how it has diversified across so many different segments from home care to other lifestyle products like body care. According to Clorox's website, more than 80% of the company's sales are generated by brands that hold first- or second-place market share in their respective categories.  Segment Product Examples Portion of Total Sales Household Febreze, GladWare, Fresh Scoop cat litter, Brita water filters 38% Cleaning Clorox disinfecting wipes, laundry soap 31% Lifestyle Burt's Bees, Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressings 16% International All products sold outside of the U.S. 15% Data source: Clorox's 2016 earnings call.  For the fiscal year 2016 ended June 30, Clorox reported 2% sales growth, to $5.8 billion. The company noted that international currency headwinds were largely to blame for lackluster sales growth, and that excluding the effects of these foreign exchange fluctuations, sales would be up 5%. Sales picked up slightly in the fourth quarter, to 3% growth year over year; perhaps more important is that volume increased by 7% over the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with 4% for the full year. Clorox has an impressive history of developing products, both via internal development and by acquiring and growing new brands. Clorox is currently working on a "2020 strategy" which is meant to boost overall market share through improvements in each category. "We are very pleased with our fiscal year 2016 performance and the progress we are making against our Strategy 2020 accelerators," said CEO Benno Dorer during the earnings conference call, "which I believe will continue to create value and drive long-term profitable growth in the years to come." Image source: The Clorox Company. Impressive earnings growth Earnings grew at a much faster rate than sales as earnings per share (EPS) climbed 12% year over year to $4.92. Clorox has continued to grow earnings impressively over each of the last five years. For fiscal year 2017, Clorox projects earnings per share in the range of $5.38 to $5.58, which would be a 9% to 13% increase over 2016. That's substantial growth for a blue-chip stock like Clorox.  CLX Normalized Diluted EPS (Annual) data by YCharts. Clorox's rising dividend Clorox's dividend history is another reason the stock looks attractive. Its dividend is $3.20 per share ($0.80 per quarter), for a 2.5% yield at the current price. That dividend has nearly tripled in the last decade, though the yield has stayed relatively even because of share price growth at the same time. Clorox has shown itself to be an income generator, and is likely to continue growing this dividend for years to come: CLX Dividend data by YCharts. But is the stock too expensive? Clorox stock has been a great investment in the past, especially in the last five years as the stock has more than doubled. But as the share price has grown, so has the stock's valuation, which is now around 25 times earnings. Compare that to its three biggest competitors, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Unilever (NYSE:UL):   Clorox Colgate P&G Unilever Market cap $16.3 billion $65.5 billion $235.9 billion $134.4 billion Most recent quarter sales growth (YOY) 2% (5.5%) (3%) (3.2%)  Most recent quarter EPS growth (YOY) 12% 6.3% (15%) 1%  Dividend yield  2.5% 2.1% 3% 3% P/E (TTM) 25.6 47.3 23.9 24.5  Data sources: Company earnings releases, Yahoo! Finance. YOY = year over year; TTM = trailing twelve-month. Clorox was the only company of those above to report rising earnings during the most recent quarter (in real dollars, not altering results to remove the effect of foreign currency swings) and also has the most impressive EPS growth. Its dividend is closely in line with its peers and has been growing substantially in the past decade. With the promise of solid execution of the company's 2020 strategy, Clorox stock seems reasonably priced, and continues to look like a solid long-term holding.  Seth McNew has no position in any stocks mentioned.

McNamara, 50, will take on the new role immediately, enabling Walmsley to focus on preparing to succeed Chief Executive Officer Andrew Witty. McNamara will report to Witty until Walmsley takes the top job in March, according to a statement Thursday. The London-based drugmaker last week ended months of speculation on who will succeed Witty, but also sparked new questions over who would lead its consumer-health division and whether Walmsley will stick to Witty’s strategy. Witty, who announced his retirement in March, has come under fire from investors for his approach, which emphasized diversification into products like toothpaste and over-the-counter painkillers as well as volume-based growth, particularly in emerging markets. McNamara oversaw business in Europe and the Americas at Glaxo’s consumer-health division. He joined the company last year from Novartis AG following completion of Glaxo’s three-part asset swap with the Swiss drugmaker. McNamara spent eleven years at Novartis, where he started off in 2004 as senior vice president of the North America over-the-counter business. Before that, he spent sixteen years at Procter & Gamble Co. He will join Glaxo’s executive team effective immediately and will continue as a member of the board of the consumer-health joint venture with Novartis. An American, he will be based in the U.K. McNamara has a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Union College and a master’s in business administration from the University of Cincinnati. He is a father of three, an avid mountain climber and enjoys skiing. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

She was 93. Nixon got her start in daytime serials thanks to her father's inadvertent assistance, the Los Angeles Times says. He was actually trying to convince her not to launch a writing career, hoping she would follow him into the burial garments business, when he set up a meeting with a pioneer in radio serial writing, Irna Phillips, to convince his daughter that her dream was foolish. But Phillips enjoyed Nixon's sample script so much, she asked her to come work for her. "It was one of the greatest moments of my life," Nixon said. "It was freedom." During the 1950s and 1960s, Nixon helped launch As the World Turns, was head writer of Guiding Light, and helped turn around Another World. She was ahead of her time, giving a Guiding Light character in 1962 uterine cancer, but CBS and sponsor Proctor & Gamble agreed to let the storyline air only if the words "cancer," "uterus," and "hysterectomy" were not used. She later formed a company with her husband to produce One Life to Live, Loving, and All My Children; she based the latter show's villain, Adam Chandler, on her father, and gave Erica Kane, her favorite character, abandonment issues like she thought she had, the Times reports. In 1981, she became the first woman to receive the Trustees Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, and in 2010, she was honored with a Daytime Emmy for lifetime achievement. Nixon's husband died in 1996. She is survived by her children Cathy, Mary, Robert, and Emily, and 11 grandchildren. Catherine Garcia   All My Children creator Agnes Nixon dies at 93 September 28, 2016 this is fine Edit David Duke is delighted by Trump's selection of Flynn, Bannon, and Sessions 11:16 a.m. ET   Former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke thinks President-elect Donald Trump's choice of Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as his national security adviser is a "great pick." Duke, who previously served as a Louisiana state representative and who ran for Senate in Louisiana this year, tweeted Thursday night that Flynn clearly knows who the "real enemies" are. Duke included a message Flynn retweeted in July as evidence: Great Pick! - Gen. Flynn's retweet shows he knows that the Saudis, ISIS & the Jewish-NeoCons are the real enemies - NOT Assad & NOT Russia! pic.twitter.com/Z9D9CHHXeQ — David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) November 18, 2016 Flynn took a lot of flak for that retweet, which was in response to a claim made by Hillary Clinton's campaign manager during an appearance on CNN that Russia was behind the hack of Democratic National Committee emails. Flynn later apologized for the retweet, which he said was a "mistake," and a Republican National Committee spokesperson said in a comment to The Guardian that "there is no place in the Republican Party for anti-Semitic comments." Flynn wasn't the only Trump appointee to get Duke's stamp of approval. Duke tweeted twice to applaud Trump's choice of Breitbart News' Steve Bannon as White House chief strategist and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Becca Stanek Bannon, Flynn, Sessions -- Great! Senate must demand that Sessions as AG stop the massive institutional race discrimination against whites! — David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) November 18, 2016 Bannon, Flynn & Sessions -- Americans are on the way to taking back our government, our nation and our children's future! #TakeItBack — David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) November 18, 2016   David Duke is delighted by Trump's selection of Flynn, Bannon, and Sessions 11:16 a.m. lists Edit 7 times Jeff Sessions' critics accused him of racism 10:41 a.m. ET   Jeff Swensen/Getty Images Decades ago, Donald Trump's newly named attorney general, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, lost an appointment to the federal bench after a 1986 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which witnesses accused Sessions of being too racist for the job. Sessions denied the charges: "I am not a racist, I am not insensitive to blacks," he has said. Here are seven times his critics have disagreed. Jeva Lange 1. "On the day in question, Mr. Sessions came into my office just as I was reading a newspaper account of some recent action of the NAACP. I casually mentioned that development to Mr. Sessions. Mr. Sessions in response stated that he believed the NAACP, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Operation PUSH, and the National Conference of Churches were all un-American organizations teaching anti-American values. This statement clearly was not intended as a joke." [Assistant U.S. attorney Thomas Figures] 2. "One African-American prosecutor testified that Mr. Sessions had called him 'boy' and joked that he thought that the Ku Klux Klan 'was okay until I found out they smoked pot.' Mr. Sessions denied calling the lawyer 'boy' but acknowledged or did not dispute the substance of the other remarks." [The New York Times] 3. "Things that I had heard firsthand from him were things that demonstrated gross racial insensitivity to black citizens of Alabama and the United States … He has never backed off from the comments he made at that time. He has never apologized for them." [Justice Department prosecutor J. Gerald Hebert] 4. "[It is] inconceivable … that a person of this attitude is qualified to be a U.S. attorney, let alone a United States federal judge … [He has] gross insensitivity to the questions of race." [Ted Kennedy] 5. "It is suggested that [Sessions] stated to Mr. Wiley at the conclusion of a particularly contentious hearing back in 1981, 'Do not worry,' or 'do not be too happy' … 'John,' meaning Archer, 'will be watching you and the n----r,' referring to the only black commissioner in Mobile." [Joe Biden] 6. "It is indeed a sad day for both the Congress and the country when a man like Jefferson Sessions … who has made overtly racist comments, could even be nominated for the federal bench." [Rep. John Conyers Jr.] 7. "Jeff Sessions, considered too racist to be a judge in '80s, is Trump's AG. Best to go back to sleep, America. I'll wake you up when it's over. [GOP strategist Ana Navarro]   7 times Jeff Sessions' critics accused him of racism 10:41 a.m. ISIS Crisis Edit ISIS teaches math by asking children to count bullets 10:31 a.m. ET   Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images When the Islamic State took over the northern Iraqi town of Qayyara in 2014, the terrorist organization briefly allowed local schools to function as usual. But soon the militants began banning subjects they didn't like — geography, history, civics — and replacing textbooks with tomes of their own making. The ISIS agenda was evident throughout their curriculum, which transformed schools for boys into recruiting stations. Even a subject as neutral as math was affected, with math problems asking children to imagine counting tools of war in their examples: "One bullet plus two bullets equals how many bullets?" The good news is that Qayyara has been ISIS-free for three months, ever since the militants were driven out earlier this year as part of the U.S.-supported Iraqi troops' push toward Mosul. Now, schools are getting back to normal — though that will be a long process thanks to a too-small teaching staff and some families' decision to simply pull their children out of class for the duration of the ISIS occupation. "We are happy to be back at school," an 8-year-old girl named Iman told Reuters. "They wanted us to come but we didn't want to, because we don't know how to study in their language: the language of violence." Bonnie Kristian   ISIS teaches math by asking children to count bullets 10:31 a.m. making the case Edit The Wall Street Journal argues Trump should liquidate his business — or face some serious 'political damage' 10:09 a.m. ET   Alex Wong/Getty Images In an editorial published late Thursday, The Wall Street Journal laid out why President-elect Donald Trump's "best option" to avoid a perceived conflict of interest between his business and his government is to "liquidate his stake" in the Trump Organization. While Trump has floated the idea of a "blind trust," turning the company entirely over to his adult children, The Wall Street Journal joined critics of the idea in saying it won't be enough. Typically, The Wall Street Journal reported, a "blind trust" is an "independent manager, not family members," and the assets being protected generally aren't as highly visible as, say, Trump's array of properties and brands. These disparities have already raised eyebrows, and the Journal contends it will only get worse: The political damage to a new administration could be extensive. If Mr. Trump doesn't liquidate, he will be accused of a pecuniary motive any time he takes a policy position. For example, the House and Senate are eager to consider tax reform — and one sticking point will be the treatment of real estate, which will be of great interest to the Trump family business. Ditto for repealing the Dodd-Frank financial law, interest rates, and so much more. [The Wall Street Journal] As "painful and perhaps costly" as Trump's break-up with his businesses may be, the "presidential stakes are too high" for him to do anything else, the newspaper's editors conclude. Head over to The Wall Street Journal to read more about what troubles Trump's business could cause him. Becca Stanek   The Wall Street Journal argues Trump should liquidate his business — or face some serious 'political damage' 10:09 a.m. ignorance is bliss Edit This Georgia man is blissfully unaware of who won the election 10:02 a.m. ET   Worried you won't like the next president? Here's an idea: Don't find out who it is. A Georgia man named Joe Chandler has done exactly that, warding off election results by using headphones and wearing a sign that reads, "I don't know who won and don't want to. Please don't tell me." FoxNews: 'Don't tell me': Georgia man deliberately stays in the dark on election results https://t.co/Hd6oJQNmD5 pic.twitter.com/GTT3cky6N7 — Smart People (@wanthillaryout) November 17, 2016 Chandler decided to remain blissfully ignorant after seeing the stress the election caused his friends. "I was invited to an election party to stay up into the night with everybody gnawing their nails, hanging on, and I thought, 'Oh, there has to be a better way,'" he explained. He originally intended to check the results the next morning but gradually kept putting the moment off to preserve the calm of not knowing. Chandler, who works from home and did not particularly like either major-party candidate, is pleased with his choice. "Having subtracted myself from this political fracas and all of the mayhem of the digital media, I kind of found the center of the cyclone," he says. "It is very peaceful in my bubble of ignorance." Bonnie Kristian   This Georgia man is blissfully unaware of who won the election 10:02 a.m. dad in chief Edit This is what Obama wanted his daughters to know after Hillary Clinton lost the election 9:51 a.m. ET   Michael Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images President Barack Obama has done a lot of comforting and reassuring since Donald Trump won the presidential election last week. One White House source told The New Yorker that when meeting with staffers the day after the election, Obama and his chief of staff, Denis McDonough, were "almost like grief counselors." But there was perhaps an even tougher conversation Obama needed to have: the one with his daughters, Malia and Sasha. Obama revealed what he wanted them to know in an interview with The New Yorker: "What I say to them is that people are complicated,” Obama told me. “Societies and cultures are really complicated. ... This is not mathematics; this is biology and chemistry. These are living organisms, and it's messy. And your job as a citizen and as a decent human being is to constantly affirm and lift up and fight for treating people with kindness and respect and understanding. And you should anticipate that at any given moment there's going to be flare-ups of bigotry that you may have to confront, or may be inside you and you have to vanquish. And it doesn't stop. ... You don't get into a fetal position about it. You don't start worrying about apocalypse. You say, okay, where are the places where I can push to keep it moving forward." [The New Yorker] Obama himself admitted, though, that he doesn't "believe in apocalyptic — until the apocalypse comes. I think nothing is the end of the world until the end of the world." Read more about how he is feeling in the face of an impending Trump presidency at The New Yorker. Jeva Lange   This is what Obama wanted his daughters to know after Hillary Clinton lost the election 9:51 a.m. what next Edit Will Democrats filibuster Trump's Supreme Court nominee? If they do, the GOP might nuke the filibuster. 8:46 a.m. ET   Joe Raedle/Getty Images Democrats are squirming at the thought of Donald Trump's upcoming opportunity to nominate a justice for the Supreme Court. And while they're thinking about giving the Republicans a taste of their own medicine by obstructing any nominee, it could come with a potentially crippling cost. The Democrats are still smarting over their counterparts' treatment of President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, who despite being nominated in February has still not gotten a congressional confirmation hearing. But payback in the form of a filibuster of Trump's nominee could cost Democrats the tools they have left as a minority, Politico reports. Currently, the Senate requires a 60-vote minimum to confirm a Supreme Court nominee, a practice that the Republicans have threatened to end if the Democratss don't play ball. "We're going to confirm the president's nominee one way or the other. And there's an easy way and there's a hard way," Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) has said. It's an open question as to how Democrats will proceed. They'll be under immense pressure from their political base to reject a nominee perceived as anti-abortion and anti-environment. They'll also have to weigh whether playing nice on one nominee may give them more leverage to play hardball later on, when Republicans may be sweating their own political future ahead of the 2020 election [...] Democrats say it's too early to decide how they'll proceed. But they admit they're worried about who Trump will pick and what it will mean for the future of the Senate. [Politico] Read more about the threat to the filibuster, and what it could mean for Trump's Supreme Court nominees, at Politico. Jeva Lange   Will Democrats filibuster Trump's Supreme Court nominee?

 Jessica Alba's Honest Company is finally removing a controversial ingredient from its products Avery Hartmans Sep. 30, 2016, 5:35 PM 5,160 facebook linkedin twitter email print REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni The Honest Company is finally removing a controversial ingredient from its laundry detergents after initially saying it didn't plan to do so.  According to a new story out from the Wall Street Journal's Serena Ng, Honest Company — Jessica Alba's $1.7 billion household products company — is planning to introduce a new detergent in 2017 that's free of an ingredient called sodium coco sulfate. The ingredient is said to contain a large amount of sodium lauryl sulfate, a cleaning agent that Honest Company has said in the past it doesn't use at all.  The fact that Honest Company was using the ingredient first came to light in March, when the Journal reported that lab tests found SLS in the detergents. The news was problematic for Honest Company, in that it thereby defies the central pitch of the company: that it sells "honestly safe, effective essentials for family and home." Alba's company came under fire last summer, too, when people claimed that its sunscreen didn't work. Honest Company's issues arise at a tense time for the startup, which filed to go public earlier this year. This month, Recode reported that the company was planning to sell itself to Proctor & Gamble or Unilever. Now, the Journal reports that Clorox and Johnson & Johnson might be interested in buying the company as well.  "Our internal R&D team, led by Dr. Laurence Dryer, consistently works to innovate across our entire product line while adhering to The Honest Company’s uncompromising safety standards," Honest Company wrote in a statement. "As part of this process, we are continuing to work on a new breakthrough cleaning line, including dish care, laundry and household cleaners, utilizing an advanced sugar-based surfactant technology to further improve the efficacy of our products."

WCPO Embroiled in controversy, the Cincinnati VA Medical Center has named a new director. Vivian Hutson will oversee an annual budget of $373 million and a staff of 2,1oo. Col. Vivian Hutson is the new VA Director in Cincinnati. Credit army Hutson recently retired as a Colonel from the U.S. Army Medical Specialist Corps and comes to the VA from the Office of the Surgeon General. She replaces Interim Director Glenn Costie. A nationally appointed committee took testimony in September in whistleblower cases at the Cincinnati VA Medical Center and is expected to conclude its findings in 90 days. During an interview with reporters at the American Legion Convention in August, Costie said Dr. Gene Goldman will lead the board made up of three to four people. More than 30 people were asked to testify in the case that primarily centers around Dr. Barbara Temeck. She alleges nearly three dozen former and current staff members, who have complained both publicly and in a letter to Secretary of Veterans Affairs Bob McDonald about cost-cutting moves and hospital safety, are retaliating against her because they are being financially impacted. McDonald told members of the American Legion the media has largely ignored the progress that has been made in delivering veterans health care through the VA system. "You've heard many times that the VA is broken,'' McDonald said. "I disagree. The VA can be and is being reformed." Yes, the former CEO of Procter & Gamble said, there are VA employees who have not done their jobs, but they are being weeded out of the system. "It's a gross misrepresentation to cherry-pick one of them and hold that person up as an example of all," said McDonald.

McNamara, who previously was head of Europe and Americas for the division whose product portfolio includes Tums antacids and Sensodyne toothpaste, succeeds Emma Walsmley, who last week was named to succeed Andrew Witty as CEO of the pharmaceutical giant when he retires in March. McNamara’s promotion, announced Thursday, takes effect immediately. “With his significant experience and expertise, Brian is the clear choice to build on the current momentum we are seeing in our business and fully maximize the future opportunities we have with our brands,” Witty said in a statement. McNamara joined GSK last year from Novartis upon completion of the transaction in which GSK acquired Novartis’s global vaccines business and created a joint consumer healthcare business controlled by GSK. He spent 11 years at Novartis and 16 years at Procter & Gamble. London-based GSK employs about 2,600 at its North American headquarters at Research Triangle Park and has another 800 employees and contractors at its manufacturing plant in Zebulon.

Watson Group&#039;s Malina Ngai talk about the rapidly changing consumer scene in Asia.</p> What are Asian consumers spending on?    Monday, 3 Oct 2016 | 12:52 AM ET | 14:23 Socially conscious, more willing to spend and highly digitally connected. Descriptions of millennials and their spending habits often run the risk of resorting to stereotypes but for businesses operating in Asia, these qualities remain key in guiding customer engagement strategies. Home to almost 60 percent of the global millennial population—typically described as those between the ages of 16 and 35, emerging Asia is fast turning into a battleground among both traditional and online retailers for the hearts (and wallets) of consumers. Key reasons for the region's appeal: The rapid rate of urbanization, as well as the large youth populations, which are expected to translate into a larger consumer base when they come of age. "Chinese consumers [are] in the process of consumption upgrading," said Daniel Zhang, chief executive officer of Alibaba, "People are basically changing their lifestyle[s]." One of the brains behind the creation of the now legendary Single's Day shopping event, Zhang said that the reason for its inception was to have people remember Alibaba's at-the-time new business-to-consumer Taobao Mall (now rebranded as Tmall) platform. "The reason we created [Single's Day] is probably for one thing, it's for survival," he said. Hu Guolin | Xinhua | Getty Images Workers sort out packages in Jiujiang City in Jiangxi Province ahead of Singles' Day. Last year alone, Alibaba attracted 434 million active buyers, according to the company's annual report. Of these shoppers, 80 percent were aged below 35, Zhang said. To cater to the digitally engaged demographic, Zhang highlighted how an Alibaba merchant last week conducted a livestream with the newly-minted Olympic Chinese women's volleyball team and reached millions of customers. "This is not purely for gaming [or] for interaction. This is also for sales," Zhang said, "This sells tons of that product … within 30 minutes." Another emerging market on consumer businesses' priority list is India. Around 250 million people in the country own smartphones although half of them do not have access to data, said Kunal Bahl, chief executive officer of Snapdeal . While infrastructure issues and remote rural populations might present logistical challenges, they also present opportunities for businesses, such as the online marketplace Snapdeal, to develop solutions that differentiate themselves from the competition. "Indian e-commerce is where Chinese e-commerce was in 2007 or 2008. We are about 8 years behind but it's not going to take us 8 years to bridge the gap," said Bahl, highlighting the pace of 4G network expansion taking place in India. Jerome Favre | Bloomberg | Getty Images A woman browses products in a Watsons store in the Tsim Sha Tsui district of Hong Kong. As for what Asian consumers want, change appears to be the only constant, said Malina Ngai, chief operating officer of the A.S. Watson Group, which operates the Watsons chain of drugstores. "The cycle of planning is really, really short," Ngai said, "These days, no one can see for more than 10 years … We review the plan [every quarter] just to see where the customers are going and what we need to do to really get customers shopping more." Bahl, the CEO of Snapdeal, agreed, "Three years ago, I [kept] saying Indian consumers are all about ABCD: astrology, Bollywood, cricket and discounts … Then it became speed of refunds and returns. Now, it's becoming who can offer next-day delivery coverage." In addition, Asian consumers prefer goods that appeal to their "sensorial expressive side" , said Magesvaran Suranjan, president of Procter & Gamble Asia Pacific. "The products have to have a certain richness in perfumes [in Asia] than in the West," explained Suranjan. Packaging also has to be more vibrant than in the West to appeal to Asian consumers, he said. "Consumers in Asia want the best … They don't want emerging market service, they want developed market services but at emerging market prices," Snapdeal's Bahl said.

Clorox is a well-diversified company that seems to be firing on all cylinders -- but is its price tag too high to make this a good investment? Seth McNew (TMFMcNew) Sep 29, 2016 at 10:00AM Image source: The Clorox Company. The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) has been a great investment over the last few decades, and could continue to be due to its brand strength, impressive earnings growth, and increasing dividend. But at 25 times earnings, is the stock too expensive? Clorox segment and brand strength  This century-old company is a lot more than just the home-cleaning brand its name suggests, offering nearly 20 brands such as Glad and Burt's Bees. Most of the company's growth comes through acquisitions, which is how it has diversified across so many different segments from home care to other lifestyle products like body care. According to Clorox's website, more than 80% of the company's sales are generated by brands that hold first- or second-place market share in their respective categories.  Segment Product Examples Portion of Total Sales Household Febreze, GladWare, Fresh Scoop cat litter, Brita water filters 38% Cleaning Clorox disinfecting wipes, laundry soap 31% Lifestyle Burt's Bees, Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressings 16% International All products sold outside of the U.S. 15% Data source: Clorox's 2016 earnings call.  For the fiscal year 2016 ended June 30, Clorox reported 2% sales growth, to $5.8 billion. The company noted that international currency headwinds were largely to blame for lackluster sales growth, and that excluding the effects of these foreign exchange fluctuations, sales would be up 5%. Sales picked up slightly in the fourth quarter, to 3% growth year over year; perhaps more important is that volume increased by 7% over the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with 4% for the full year. Clorox has an impressive history of developing products, both via internal development and by acquiring and growing new brands. Clorox is currently working on a "2020 strategy" which is meant to boost overall market share through improvements in each category. "We are very pleased with our fiscal year 2016 performance and the progress we are making against our Strategy 2020 accelerators," said CEO Benno Dorer during the earnings conference call, "which I believe will continue to create value and drive long-term profitable growth in the years to come." Image source: The Clorox Company. Impressive earnings growth Earnings grew at a much faster rate than sales as earnings per share (EPS) climbed 12% year over year to $4.92. Clorox has continued to grow earnings impressively over each of the last five years. For fiscal year 2017, Clorox projects earnings per share in the range of $5.38 to $5.58, which would be a 9% to 13% increase over 2016. That's substantial growth for a blue-chip stock like Clorox.  CLX Normalized Diluted EPS (Annual) data by YCharts. Clorox's rising dividend Clorox's dividend history is another reason the stock looks attractive. Its dividend is $3.20 per share ($0.80 per quarter), for a 2.5% yield at the current price. That dividend has nearly tripled in the last decade, though the yield has stayed relatively even because of share price growth at the same time. Clorox has shown itself to be an income generator, and is likely to continue growing this dividend for years to come: CLX Dividend data by YCharts. But is the stock too expensive? Clorox stock has been a great investment in the past, especially in the last five years as the stock has more than doubled. But as the share price has grown, so has the stock's valuation, which is now around 25 times earnings. Compare that to its three biggest competitors, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Unilever (NYSE:UL):   Clorox Colgate P&G Unilever Market cap $16.3 billion $65.5 billion $235.9 billion $134.4 billion Most recent quarter sales growth (YOY) 2% (5.5%) (3%) (3.2%)  Most recent quarter EPS growth (YOY) 12% 6.3% (15%) 1%  Dividend yield  2.5% 2.1% 3% 3% P/E (TTM) 25.6 47.3 23.9 24.5  Data sources: Company earnings releases, Yahoo! Finance. YOY = year over year; TTM = trailing twelve-month. Clorox was the only company of those above to report rising earnings during the most recent quarter (in real dollars, not altering results to remove the effect of foreign currency swings) and also has the most impressive EPS growth. Its dividend is closely in line with its peers and has been growing substantially in the past decade. With the promise of solid execution of the company's 2020 strategy, Clorox stock seems reasonably priced, and continues to look like a solid long-term holding.  Seth McNew has no position in any stocks mentioned.
