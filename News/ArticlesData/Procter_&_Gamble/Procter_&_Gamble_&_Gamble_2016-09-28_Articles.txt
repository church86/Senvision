Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Sep 28, 2016 at 2:21PM Image source: iStock/Thinkstock. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) is flush with cash thanks to a portfolio reboot that's involved selling off a few valuable brands, including Duracell batteries and Coty beauty products. Yet weak operating trends have produced two consecutive years of disappointing dividend raises for income investors. The consumer products giant boosted its payout by 3% last year and by just 1% in 2016. So today I'm looking at Target (NYSE:TGT), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ): Three stocks that investors might prefer over P&G right now. Here's how the dividends stack up against each other. Dividend comparison Metric Procter & Gamble Target Coca-Cola Johnson & Johnson Yield 3% 3.5% 3% 2.7% Last raise 1% 7% 6% 7% Payout ratio 76% 44% 77% 57% Data sources: Company financial filings and S&P Capital IQ data. Last raise is the most recent percent change in the dividend. Target for the yield Target's stock is out of favor right now in part due to a slowdown in the retailing industry. Yet the company has stumbled enough to separate itself from peers -- and not in a good way. Customer traffic dropped last quarter, even as Wal-Mart's rose. And Target's comparable-store sales are negative at the same time that grocery competitor Kroger has pushed its growth streak past 50 straight quarters. Investors have punished the stock for those missteps: Target is now valued at less than 13 times earnings, compared to a price-to-earnings ratio of 15 for both Kroger and Wal-Mart. Investors who believe the retailer will recover from this recent slump, as it has many times in its near 50-year history, might be enticed by that discount -- especially considering that Target boasts a market-beating 3.5% dividend yield, a low payout ratio, and a strong track record for recent dividend increases. Coca-Cola for the profits Like P&G, Coca-Cola is making a major structural change that it hopes will produce a leaner, more profitable, and faster-growing enterprise. Rather than sell off parts of its portfolio, though, the beverage giant is refranchising a large portion of its bottlers. Coke is aiming to produce a turnaround in the disappointing operating trends that drove volume growth of just 1% through the first two quarters of 2016. CEO Muhtar Kent and his team have identified several levers that the company can pull to achieve that goal, including focusing on emerging markets like China and India while investing heavily in non-soda brands like waters and juices. Its hefty dividend, meanwhile, should continue climbing at a steady pace as the refranchising initiative boosts profitability. Johnson & Johnson for innovation Johnson & Johnson may not pay as meaty a yield as P&G right now (2.7% vs. 3%), but that's partly because the stock is up so sharply. Shares have more than doubled over the last five years including dividend reinvestments, compared to a market-lagging 71% rise for P&G. JNJ Total Return Price data by YCharts. Its dividend growth rate is impressive, too: J&J's payout has improved at a 7% compound annual rate over the last five years and by nearly 9% over the past decade. Yet one of the best reasons to like J&J over Procter & Gamble is that, while both companies admit that innovation is critical to their entire business model, only one has demonstrated consistent success at it. Johnson & Johnson dedicates $9 billion to research and development each year and investors see the fruits of that spending: Roughly 25% of sales last year came from products that J&J introduced in just the past five years. In contrast, P&G hasn't launched a new $1 billion product in over a decade. Procter & Gamble pays one of the most dependable dividends on the market, raising it for 60 consecutive years. As impressive as that streak is, however, the latest hike was for less than $0.01 per share. Income investors have plenty of options for stronger dividend growth than that.

Crunch Network Large CPGs are under attack by startups… and consumers are winning Posted Sep 28, 2016 by Tien Tzuo (@tientzuo) 0 SHARES Next Story Uber teams with Sears on new rewards program for drivers and riders Tien Tzuo Crunch Network Contributor Tien Tzuo is the CEO of Zuora. More posts by this contributor: To compete with Amazon, Walmart should cut itself in half How Prince and Bowie started streaming music services How to join the network Consumer packaged goods are big business — valued at more than $2 trillion — with much of that market share dominated by CPG powerhouses like Unilever, P&G and Nestlé. These CPG leaders know a lot about packaged goods — a lot about how to manufacture and market and sell at scale. But, as is becoming more and more apparent, they don’t really know very much at all about their customers. And this is proving to be a problem. The issue is built into the category: The large CPG companies don’t sell directly to their consumers. They sell to retailers like Walmart, who then sell to consumers. So the CPG giants miss the whole direct-to-consumer relationship. They have no access to — or insight into — the people who actually buy and use their products. And now they’re under attack by a new breed of digitally native, vertically integrated startups that are reinventing what it means to buy everything — from razor blades to toothbrushes to mattresses. Bonobos, Warby Parker, Birchbox, Harry’s, Casper… the list goes on. These guys are keenly interested in establishing smart relationships with their customers, and they are establishing flexible, recurring revenue-based business models to make it happen. In this new environment, it’s getting harder for CPGs to grow as they’ve traditionally done. Look at P&G (owner of the Gillette razor brand) which lost 12 percent share of the men’s razor and blade industry last year, while upstart direct-to-consumer razor startup Dollar Shave Club claimed 5 percent of the market. The big vendors can try to buy their way out of the problem — much like how Unilever eventually bought Dollar Shave Club. But in order to stay relevant, they’re going to have to embrace digital transformation and incorporate direct-to-consumer strategies into their own business model. Here are seven strategies that leading CPGs can — and must — adopt to better engage with consumers in the digital age. E-commerce. As recently as 2013, only about 3 percent of non-food consumer packaged goods was purchased through online sales. But online sale of consumer packaged goods is starting to pick up, and the CPG powerhouses are getting on board. In the 2014 Customer Channel Management Survey from McKinsey, which surveyed 50+ CPG leaders, e-commerce was “ranked as the second leading driver of change over the next five years.” The potential for CPG online sales is only going to grow as e-commerce giants like Amazon increase their focus on the sale of groceries and personal care products with Amazon Pantry. In addition, CPGs can explore distribution to niche online retailers like Ulta or Drugstore.com, as well as individual brands selling direct to consumers online. Social. Leading CPG companies are used to selling their consumer goods through the middleman of retail partners and rely heavily on in-store marketing to propel their brands. Startups, without the deep pockets of these CPG powerhouses, must look elsewhere to create their brands. Consumers have changed — and the consumer packaged goods industry needs to respond. Social is the solution. People have always looked to their networks for trusted recommendations, but now this old-school practice has met the digital age as consumers look to their online social networks for product suggestions. Companies can use social platforms to spread the word and build their brands, while capitalizing on accessible platforms like YouTube to generate buzz. For example, Dollar Shave Club led a master class in social with their hilarious 2012 YouTube video introducing their brand: “our blades are f**king great.” Just six hours after release, their entire inventory sold out and the video has gone on to garner over 4.75 million views. When done well, social is an effective (and inexpensive) way to connect directly with consumers to create accessible, and sought-after, brands. Digital first. Brick-and-mortar retailers used to be paranoid about people coming into their stores and then finding cheaper things online. Now people are doing online research and using retail stores as showrooms. The digital influence has flipped the script. Smart companies are using digital to create a brand, and a brand experience, rather than push products. For example, look at a company like Casper, which doesn’t promote itself as merely a mattress company, but rather a digital-first brand focused around the concept of sleep. Subscriptions. The CPG industry is made up of products that people are always going to need, and that frequently need to be replaced. You know what this sounds like? An industry ready to be subscriptionized! A subscription model isn’t just about the recurring revenue derived from repeat purchases; it’s a key to developing ongoing relationships. When your consumer becomes a subscriber, that establishes a relationship — and that foundation is one that businesses can build on and monetize. Niche focus. We’ve seen CPG leaders cutting smaller brands and not seeking out new brands as they instead focus their efforts on a small number of core brands. For example, P&G announced last year that they were planning on divesting about 100 “non-core” brands in favor of honing their focus on 70 choice brands. Related Articles Away, The Direct-To-Consumer Luggage Brand, Packs Up $2.5 Million FTC Officials Back Tesla's Right To Sell Cars Direct To Consumers Rue La La’s Founder Returns With M.Gemi, Direct-To-Consumer Italian Footwear But consumers don’t care about “distribution efficiency” for CPG companies. They care about getting the products they need, when they need them. Consumers don’t want less choice and mass-produced products. They want convenience, accessibility and an improved consumer experience. This is why companies like oral care product Hello are making their mark with their niche products, quirky flavors and a personable approach to consumers. In-store technology. As consumers demand ever-improved shopping experiences (and the best deals), many retailers are looking to technology to enhance the consumer experience. This includes more prosaic options like price-checking stands, but it’s also transformative technology like Sephora’s Fragrance IQ, an interactive kiosk that uses tech to provide consumers with customized fragrance recommendations. And it’s also beacon technology: hardware that sends push notifications to targeted consumers. This means that RiteAid can send you discount coupons as soon as you enter the store. Internet of Things. We’re just starting to see the potential of IoT, but already we can see that it poses a huge opportunity for CPG companies. As connected devices become more popular, they’re going to completely cut out the middleman, with washing machines ordering more detergent when they’re running low, or refrigerators placing a milk order. In short, consumers have changed — and the consumer packaged goods industry needs to respond. The leading CPG Goliaths may not yet be fearing the advancing Davids, but they should be watching. The share shift to these direct-to-consumer brands is gaining momentum, and these upstart brands are collectively leading a movement. If the CPG giants can ride the wave of digital transformation and adapt to the Subscription Economy, they will continue to drive growth while putting the “Consumer” back into “Consumer Packaged Goods.” Featured Image: ferlistockphoto/Getty Images 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe Latest Crunch Report Tesla Acquisition of SolarCity Approved | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Consumer packaged goods eCommerce Popular Posts Featured Stories Shareholders approve Tesla acquisition of SolarCity 19 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Airbnb is turning itself into an ‘experience’ machine beyond just booking places to stay 22 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Open source and coopetition are the new normal 23 hours ago | Ron Miller YC tries a new experiment: temporary partners 23 hours ago | Connie Loizos Latest From TechCrunch BMW and Baidu’s self-driving car partnership has reportedly run out of gas 18 minutes ago | Jon Russell Sesame Street’s VC fund makes its first investment in tutoring app Yup 33 minutes ago | Lora Kolodny Sony’s Xperia Ear wearable voice assistant will be available in December for $200 49 minutes ago | Brian Heater Google reverses its ‘digital death sentence’ for Pixel phone resellers 1 hour ago | Sarah Perez Comment moderation powered by Up Next Uber teams with Sears on new rewards program for drivers and riders Posted Sep 28, 2016 CrunchBoard Job Listings Director, Software Security @ Practice Fusion at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Developer at CastleBranch (Wilmington, NC, United States) Infrastructure Engineer Tango at The Sourcery (Mountain View, CA, United States) Senior Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Software Engineer @ Pared at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2016 AOL Inc.

The split-off transaction is a key step in the previously announced separation from P&G of its global fine fragrances, salon professional, cosmetics and retail hair color businesses, along with select hair styling brands (collectively referred to as "P&G Specialty Beauty Brands"). In the proposed transaction, P&G will transfer the assets and liabilities of P&G Specialty Beauty Brands, other than specified excluded brands, to Galleria Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of P&G created to facilitate the transaction. Following completion of the exchange offer, Galleria Co. will merge with a subsidiary of Coty Inc. (NYSE:COTY) and become a wholly owned subsidiary of Coty. The exchange offer provides P&G shareholders with the opportunity to exchange their shares of P&G common stock for shares of Galleria Co. common stock. Each share of Galleria Co. common stock will be converted into the right to receive one share of Coty class A common stock upon completion of the merger, which is expected to occur as promptly as practicable following completion of the exchange offer. P&G is offering 409,726,299 shares of Galleria Co. common stock for shares of P&G common stock. Based on the final exchange ratio, P&G will accept for exchange a maximum of 104,969,205 shares of P&G common stock in the exchange offer. P&G shareholders who tender their shares of P&G common stock in the exchange offer will receive approximately 3.9033 shares of Coty class A common stock (subject to receipt of cash in lieu of fractional shares) for each share of P&G common stock accepted for exchange. The exchange and the merger are expected to be tax-free to participating P&G shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The final calculated per-share value of the shares of P&G common stock and the final calculated per-share value of the shares of Galleria Co. common stock, in each case determined in the manner described in the Prospectus dated September 1, 2016 (the "Prospectus"), would have resulted in an exchange ratio higher than the upper limit of 3.9033. Accordingly, the final exchange ratio has been set at 3.9033 shares of Galleria Co. common stock for each share of P&G common stock accepted in the exchange offer. Based on the calculated per-share value of P&G common stock and the calculated per-share value of Galleria Co. common stock, in each case determined in the manner described in the Prospectus, tendering P&G shareholders will receive approximately $1.042 of Coty class A common stock for each $1.00 of P&G common stock accepted in the exchange offer. The exchange offer and withdrawal rights will expire at 12:00 midnight (the last minute of the day), Eastern Daylight (New York City) Time, on September 29, 2016, unless extended or terminated. The exchange offer will be subject to proration if the exchange offer is oversubscribed, and the number of shares of P&G common stock accepted in the exchange offer may be fewer than the number of shares tendered. If the exchange offer is completed but not fully subscribed, P&G will distribute all of the shares of Galleria Co. common stock it continues to own as a pro rata dividend to all P&G shareholders whose shares of P&G common stock remain outstanding and have not been accepted for exchange in the exchange offer. As promptly as practicable following completion of the exchange offer and, if the exchange offer is completed but is not fully subscribed, the subsequent pro rata dividend of all remaining shares of Galleria Co. common stock to the remaining P&G shareholders, a wholly owned subsidiary of Coty will merge with and into Galleria Co., with Galleria Co. surviving the merger and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Coty. The transactions are subject to customary closing conditions, including a minimum tender condition. For more information about the proposed transaction, please visit the website that P&G maintains for the exchange offer at www.dfking.com/pg. For more information about the exchange offer, please contact the information agent, D.F. King Co., Inc., at (212) 269-5550 (for banks and brokers) and (877) 297-1747 (for all other callers).

Organic sales fell for the second straight year to stay barely positive at 1%. The company's earnings declined as well, ticking down 2%. Increasing capital returns have been a bright spot for investors, though. P&G spent $15.4 billion (100% of operating cash flow) on stock buybacks and dividends -- up from $11.9 billion (or 82% of cash flow) in fiscal 2015. Yet the company plans to blow past these recent results by giving shareholders $22 billion of capital over the next 12 months. That's greater than the individual market capitalization of more than half of the companies on the S&P 500. Here's how P&G aims to pull off one of the market's biggest cash return plans. Where the money is coming from As it did in the prior fiscal year, P&G's brand-shedding initiative will provide a significant chunk of these capital return funds. The company is almost done closing the sale of its Coty beauty product line, which will raise $15 billion that it can send to shareholders -- significantly above last year's biggest brand sale, the transfer of the Duracell battery line to Berkshire Hathaway for $8 billion. The selling off of these two large brands, and nearly 100 smaller ones, is leaving P&G with a 15% decline in its revenue base and a 5% drop in earnings power. But the resulting company, management hopes, will be faster growing, more flexible, and more profitable. Additional cash will be raised through efficiency initiatives. P&G has cut about $2 billion per year from its cost of goods, for example, and has found major savings in slicing advertising overhead while improving its inventory turnover rate. Overall, productivity savings are projected to amount to $10 billion over the next five fiscal years. Where the cash is going Over two-thirds of the capital that P&G is returning to shareholders this year will come in the form of stock repurchases. Most of that total will happen in conjunction with the Coty beauty sale, but the company will also regularly make direct share purchases, too. As a result, P&G's share count stands to continue falling at a significant pace -- adding to the 14% decline investors have seen over the last decade. PG Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Annual) data by YCharts. Dividends will play a much smaller role in the return plan, given that the company just increased its payout by the smallest amount in recent memory. Income investors will receive about $7 billion in dividends this year, right on par with last year's result. P&G's dividend raises since 2003. Data source: Company financial filings. Since reported earnings are under pressure from weak sales growth and unfavorable currency exchange moves, shareholders shouldn't expect significant dividend hikes, at least until the company's payout ratio falls closer to 50% from the near 80% mark it reached last year. Can P&G keep it up? P&G doesn't have a comparably huge brand sale in the works for next year that would inject billions into its capital return funds. Cost cuts and a projected return to stronger organic growth will have to do most of the heavy lifting then. Still, management is confident that it will deliver as much as $54 billion to shareholders over the next three years. That implies the cash return pace will fall to about $16 billion in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 from this year's record $22 billion haul.

Frankie Bridge has spoken candidly about how motherhood has changed her outlook on life. The Saturdays singer, who is currently supporting Superdrug and P&G's FeelSuper campaign to raise money for Marie Curie, has opened up about the biggest lesson she has learned being a mum-of-two to her and husband Wayne Bridge's sons Carter and Parker. CLICK TO VIEW GALLERY Frankie Bridge revealed what motherhood has taught her exclusively to HELLO! Online "Just to stress less," the 27-year-old told HELLO! Online exclusively. "It sounds stupid because you would have thought it goes the opposite way, but I've always been such an anxious person, I overthink everything. I'm always worrying about everyone and everything and actually, it's gone the opposite way since I've had children." She continued: "You don't have control over everything. Obviously I want the best for the boys and I worry about them, but you just can't stress too much. It takes less of the heat off yourself because you think less about yourself and what's going on in your life and more about theirs." The singer is fronting Superdrug and P&G's FeelSuper campaign That's not to say the brunette beauty doesn't allow herself some 'me-time', with Frankie revealing that one of her go-to pampering treatments is a nice soak in the bath. "I never used to be much of a bath person and now, I just really appreciate just getting that time being in the bath for at least ten minutes," she said. "Just to chill, maybe do a face mask or a hair mask or something like that – extra special little treatments." Her pampering products? "Just the kids' stuff or something like that!" she quips. She admitted that her beauty regime had changed since she had children, explaining that "you just want to be quick whatever you do". However, there is one golden skincare rule she makes sure to follow. "I will always take my make-up off at night, always," she said. She and husband Wayne have two adorable little boys When it comes to her favourite products, the London-born star admitted she prefers multi-tasking beauty heroes. "Olay do a nice two-in-one tinted moisturiser," she revealed. "I think nowadays everyone wants that natural glow, no-one really likes to look like they've made an effort." She added: "I think that as a mum, it's good because you can whack it on and you look healthy, that's always good." When it comes to her healthy lifestyle, Frankie admitted that she doesn't follow a particular diet, but does enjoy exercise as a way to unwind. "I try and work out most days," she confessed. "I know that's not very relaxing, but I go and do classes with my friends so I get to socialise and work out at the same time. It's just having that hour to myself, doing just one thing that I want to do a day, it's really good." The campaign aims to raise £200,000 for Marie Curie Husband Wayne has also inspired her to take up boxing, although she admitted she can't "keep up" with his routine. "I do boxing at a proper little boxing gym," she said. "Wayne does proper boxing – I try and keep up with him but I can't! I [also] do Pilates and T-REX, occasionally spinning but I hate it – that's if I'm really trying to make a good effort but there's not one part of it that I enjoy." It's been a busy few weeks for Frankie, who is once again fronting the FeelSuper campaign to help raise money for Marie Curie. "This is our second time around now, with Superdrug and P&G we're raising money for Marie Curie and we wanted to raise over £100,000 and we managed to raise over £200,000 in the end!" she revealed. "That equals ten nurses for a year for Marie Curie, so that was amazing. We thought, 'Oh, let's do it again' – so no pressure! Now we want to raise over £200,000 again." Frankie Bridge is once again supporting the Superdrug and P&G FeelSuper Campaign, which last year raised £200,000 for Marie Curie in 2015. From 21st September to 18th October, each time you buy selected P&G products in a Superdrug store nationwide or at Superdrug.com, including brands such as Max Factor, Olay, Gillette Pantene – and many more, P&G will make a donation to Marie Curie.

Subscribe Now A Hyper-Targeted Audience Is Not Necessarily the Right Audience Staying focused on people, not proxies By Gerry Bavaro September 27, 2016, 11:45 PM EDT Sponsored There's a reason Procter & Gamble is pumping the brakes on its Facebook targeting efforts. And it's no coincidence that Y&R's CEO contends it's time to rethink ad targeting. While targeting is a valuable tool for marketers, its lack of context and accuracy annoys consumers to the point where they're opting out of ads altogether, and the industry is taking note. For most brands, targeting should not be a primary focus. That's because a hyper-targeted audience is not necessarily the correct audience much of the time. Instead, marketers and buyers should be thinking about audience quality. The correct audience has fidelity. They're not reached by just demographic identifiers or tracking cookies but by messaging that's personal, in-context and highly relevant to their needs and emotions. By contrast, much of the low-fidelity targeting based on cookies, panel data and device IDs in market today creates a blurred perception of your audience at best. For example, you might think you're retargeting ads to a woman who browsed your site for high heels, but it's just as likely you're bombarding her husband with discounts for pumps. In another scenario, millennials might be your target, but some millennials are bankers with two kids and a house, while others just up and moved to Colorado to work in a tackle shop. If you serve these two different consumers the same ad, you're giving both a bad experience. It's no wonder over 40 million of them have turned on ad blockers. This doesn't mean we have to abandon programmatic tools and targeting. But instead of simply toggling a switch to target an audience, brands and buyers need to do the upstream work to ensure the accuracy, relevance and potential receptivity of that audience to a message are spot on. They need to use high-fidelity, people-based data to better inform their creative, their content planning, audience creation and the dynamic ad and content decisions that occur across the consumer journey. That means the consumer's experience begins with relevant awareness, interest and action that carries through to landing pages, emails and offers consumers get after clicking an ad. This is not a fantasy. Merkle's Publisher Addressable Marketplaces, aka PAM, lets advertisers match their CRM data on an individual level with extensive audience information provided by Merkle as well as premium publishers, including Pandora, Realtor.com and LiveIntent. Informed by this extensive data, and linked together by a person level ID, clients can build compelling, personalized ads that get served against the publishers' most desirable content—to exactly the right people. Consumers get a vastly better ad experience. The result of high-fidelity audiences and targeting models that are built on rich, person-level data sources is the ability to execute brand and creative planning that is much more informed, not to mention more engaging—Merkle's PAM clients are seeing 30 percent increases in engagement and conversion rates. Fidelity makes it possible to better leverage CRM and wider PII-based matching and targeting across a growing number of digital media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Google and YouTube. And as addressable video and TV buying accelerates, we also see this model as a competitive advantage. High-fidelity advertising is no simple task. It requires organizations to seriously reconsider their strategy as well as their technology. CMOs need to unite their disparate data groups, bringing together CRM with communications, media strategy and planning. But the effort is worth it. Done right, advertisers can execute more precise, influential campaigns, and publishers can enjoy greater monetization of their premium inventory. You just have to unlock the data and stay focused on people, not proxies.

For well over 150 years, Folgers has been delivering ground, whole-bean, instant, and home-brew coffees to millions of sleepy consumers. Check out some facts on the company's history, from their origins in whaling to some unfortunate run-ins with Charles Manson and snapping turtles. 1. THE FAMILY WAS NAME-DROPPED IN MOBY-DICK. For centuries, the Folger clan of Nantucket was renowned for their whaling efforts. (Oil from whale blubber was often used for lamps until kerosene grew in popularity.) They were so well known that author Herman Melville referred to "a long line of Folgers and harpooneers" in his classic Moby-Dick. 2. THE COMPANY WAS FOUNDED THANKS TO THE GOLD RUSH. Folgers James Folger was just 15 years old when his parents dispatched him and two older brothers to San Francisco to mine for gold in 1849. As plans go, it wasn’t a great one: the Folger boys didn’t have enough money to travel to the mining areas, so James stayed behind to earn some cash. He wound up working for the Pioneer Steam Coffee and Spice Mills company, which was marketing an early, commercially roasted ground coffee. Two decades later, James returned—this time with more cash—and bought the business, renaming it J.A. Folger & Co. in 1872. 3. MAXWELL HOUSE WAS AN EARLY NEMESIS. After decades of being a regional favorite, Folgers was purchased by Procter & Gamble in 1963 and quickly became part of the national competition for store-bought coffee brands. Wary of giving up any ground, Maxwell House formed an in-house "Folgers Defense Team" in 1971. The result: Horizon, a coffee that came in a red can similar to Folgers, and a television commercial character named Aunt Cora (played by Margaret Hamilton, the Wicked Witch from 1939’s The Wizard of Oz). Cora was meant to be a take on Folgers’ Mrs. Olson (see below), with the hope that if Maxwell House ran the commercials in regions early enough, Olson would seem like a second-rate take-off. Folgers was forced to lower their price from $1.20 to 87 cents per can just to remain competitive. By 1979, however, they had taken over 26.5 percent of the market share, well ahead of Maxwell House’s 22.3 percent. 4. EARLY COMMERCIALS WERE NOT VERY PC. While Folgers has a history of memorable television spots, their most enduring ad campaign revolved around a Swedish character named Mrs. Olson, who appeared to keep busy by introducing Folgers coffee to her overworked neighbors in a series of pretty sexist ads in the 1950s and 1960s. (Folgers conducted research into how petulant the onscreen husbands could get and found housewives considered any kind of verbal abuse so typical as to be acceptable.) Virginia Christine, who portrayed Olson for 21 years, was born in Stanton, Iowa in 1920. When the ads grew popular, the town renovated its trademark water tower so it resembled a coffee pot in her honor. 5. THEY HAVE A LINK TO THE MANSON MURDERS. One of the 20th century’s most infamous crimes was the murder of Sharon Tate and four of her houseguests in 1969 by disciples of cult leader Charles Manson. Among the victims: Abigail Folger, the 25-year-old Folger fortune heiress, daughter of Peter Folger and great-granddaughter of founder James Folger.  (Manson and his cohorts were convicted of first-degree murder in 1971.) 6. THE "PETER" COMMERCIAL RAN FOR OVER 17 YEARS. You’ll know it when you see it: in the 1986 television spot, a college student named Peter gets dropped off at the family home in a Volkswagen Beetle and surreptitiously makes coffee for his sleeping parents with the help of his younger sister. It’s a cozy little bit, and consumers responded so strongly that Folgers ran the ad for 17 consecutive years. Greg Wrangler, who played the coffee-making intruder, told BrandLandUSA.com in 2008 that producers wanted it to be timeless. "I remember they were really concerned about the look of the spot," he said. "I’m referring to their choices on wardrobe … the Irish wool sweater, the VW Beetle that drops me off … they didn’t want it to be dated … which I think was a big factor in their ability to run it for so long." 7. A WOMAN FOUND A SNAPPING TURTLE IN ONE CAN. A lot of coffee comes into the United States via New Orleans, which is why 2005’s Hurricane Katrina resulted in a marked disruption of supply. The natural disaster may have had other side effects: According to the Associated Press, Marjorie Morris of Ainsworth, Iowa found a dead baby snapping turtle in her can of Folgers. While no harm came to Morris, she was dismayed by her timing: the 77-year-old had been using the can for a month before spotting the added ingredient. 8. THEY CAME UP WITH SOME PRETTY CLEVER MANHOLE COVER ADS. John Morton via Flickr // CC BY-SA 2.0 In 2006, Folgers garnered some positive PR when they used foot-proof signage to cover manholes in New York City and made them resemble hot cups of coffee, complete with steam emitting from holes in the cover. While clever, the stunt had an unintended side effect: the aroma from the sewers was not what you’d normally associate with coffee.  9. THEY’RE PRETTY TIGHT WITH DUNKIN’. Folgers was acquired by the J.M. Smucker company in 2008, putting it under the same corporate umbrella as the Dunkin' Donuts retail license. Together, the two home coffee brands made $577 million for the company in the second quarter of 2016 alone.

Procter and Gamble the manufacturer of Always Brand, announced the start of the always keeping girls in school program in Nyeri which will see over 800 girls receive a year's supply of sanitary pads.PHOTO;KIBATA KIHU/STANDARD More than 800 girls will receive a year's supply of sanitary pads and underwear. The initiative is as a result of a partnership between governor Nderitu Gachagua's wife Margaret and consumer goods manufacturer, Proctor and Gamble (P&G). P&G, the maker of Always, announced Thursday that it would provide the essential commodity to girls from vulnerable backgrounds under its 'Always Keeping Girls in School Programme. The company hopes to keep more than 12,000 girls in school, many of whom cannot afford the sanitary pads and have to stay away from school during their menstruation. Girls from poor backgrounds and rural areas lose 25 per cent of their school time during their periods. Share this story: Related Are your sanitary products causing that itch?

Home About Us The Catholic Free Press Mission Friends of The Free Press Who’s Who Photo Galleries Contact Us Subscribe to Catholic Free Press Advertise with The Catholic Free Press Order Diocesan Directory Links Sep 16 TV star Frank Runyeon imparts lessons in Blackstone Posted By The Catholic Free Press September 16, 2016 | 4:39 pm | Featured Article #2 Facebook0 Twitter0 Pinterest0 Google+0 LinkedIn0 By Tanya Connor | The Catholic Free Press BLACKSTONE – God should be at the center, but he’s been cut out of life. That makes it harder to teach the faith. This message was communicated Sunday, Sept. 11, when television star Frank Runyeon spoke to religious education students, teachers and parents at St. Theresa Parish. But then he showed how children can make a difference. Mr. Runyeon has translated and adapted biblical texts for his one-man dramas, including “Luke: Stories on the Road,” which he presented Tuesday, Sept. 13, for a parish mission here, and “The Letter of James: What are you doing?” presented Wednesday. Sunday he performed “Salt and Light” for grades 1-5, and talked to grades 6-10 about “Hollywood versus Faith.” Mr. Runyeon’s familiar with the actor’s world. He starred for seven years on “As the World Turns” and for four years on the Emmy-award-winning “Santa Barbara,” according to his website. He’s also acted in other shows and hosted his own radio talk show. On Sunday he offered glimpses behind the scenes, recounting how he was told he hadn’t been hired to do quality acting or present life as it is, but to “sell soap.” (Soap-maker Procter and Gamble sponsored soap operas, advertising its products.) News broadcasts too are designed to “get you to sit through the commercials,” and begin with the bloodiest story, Mr. Runyeon said. And entertainment focuses on violence and death “so you stop for a second, like (at) a terrible accident.” Often when they are facing hardships, people bargain with God, he said. But filmmakers don’t usually show characters talking to God because people disagree about God, he said. And, in public school, people are not to talk about God, he said. But you can’t put God to the side, because what is in the center of your life becomes your god, he explained. He also drew other contrasts between screen and scriptural values. In commercials one is told that happiness comes from buying things, but Jesus says, “Sell all your stuff.” (Mt 19:21) Females are told happiness is in how they look, so they focus on weight loss, sometimes nearly killing themselves. But St. Paul said, “Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit” (I Cor 6:19). The culture emphasizes winning, Mr. Runyeon noted. Students are pushed to get As, so they think losing is the worst thing, he said, telling of a student who hung himself because he only heard the story “out there” in the world. The story in church might not seem as enticing, “it just happens to be the truth,” he said. It’s about relationships with people and, most importantly, God. He urged listeners, “Have a relationship with the One who is the truth.” “It’s actually pretty true,” Allison Sawyer, 13, said of Mr. Runyeon’s talk, adding that youth are pressured to get good grades. She said maybe teachers or parents should tell them not to worry; they will still get a house and a job. “I thought it was really inspiring,” said Toni Marino, 13. “It made sense, why all the movies have pretty girls in them.” The talk helped her understand why pretty girls get everything they want, and others don’t, she said. She said now she’ll question things, not just assume they’re true. “We just need people that are able to communicate the message,” said her father, John Marino, a confirmation teacher. “He gives teachers and educators a lot of good talking points.… It reminded me that we have to encourage these kids not to just listen to what’s being fed them (but) to question everything that they see.” Mr. Runyeon helped parents understand why there’s a disconnect for youth when they’re taught about the faith, he said. He said adults are quick to judge and simply tell students to pay attention. “I wished I could do that for my students – what he did for me,” said Deborah Champeau, a grade 8 religious education teacher born in 1951. “It’s not that complicated … God at the center of everything. We grew up in a different time.… All of my friends – God was a part of their lives.” Now, she said, Catholicism is like a second language that seems irrelevant to students. Mr. Runyeon used drama to make Scripture relevant to students in grades 1-5. Like an actor’s script, Scripture “tells us the part we’re supposed to play,” he said. Dramatizing Jesus’ “riddles” – “You are the salt of the earth” and “You are the light of the world” – Mr. Runyeon pretended young listeners were a salt shaker and a light bulb. He said people are like salt when they bring out the goodness in others and keep things from going bad. They are like light when they show others the right way to go. Mr. Runyeon incorporated these challenges into his dramatization of King Herod’s birthday party, at which Herod made a rash promise to the dancer, which led to the killing of John the Baptist (Mk 6:14-29). “John the Baptist died,” Mr. Runyeon said. “That’s what can happen when we forget to be salt and light.” But he said there was a happy ending – John went to heaven. “Do you know we really do have a King, and we’re in the court of our King right now?” Mr. Runyeon asked. He had listeners put their hands on their hearts, face the tabernacle and sing, to the tune of “Happy Birthday,”: “I’ll be salt for you. I’ll be salt for you. I’ll be salt not pepper. Not pepper, Kachoo!” Sign up for our free E-Report Subscriptions 1-year Paper/eEdition : $30.00 USD - yearly 1-year eEdition only : $30.00 USD - yearly 1-year paper only : $30.00 USD - yearly Advertisements Charlton Manor Rest Home Advertise with The Catholic Free Press Browse categories Local National International Vatican Commentary Spiritual Social/Video CNS News RSS Feed Widget Copyright © 2016 Catholic Free Press.

The Patanjali Food and Herbal Park at Haridwar - Photo: Kamal Narang September 29, 2016:   Of gurus and grassroots Why is Patanjali such a success in India? I hear the company has ₹5,000 crore in revenue? Mumbai Mini, Patanjali Ayurved has taken baby steps in reaching Ayurveda and ayurvedic products to consumers in India and the Indian diaspora over the last decade. Its products are basic (except for noodles, which jolts me, frankly speaking), of robust quality, functional and priced just right. The brands, in all their rusticity, do a fair bit of un-branding to categories that require un-branding, such as FMCG products of the basic kind. FMCG offerings were pioneered by local players, who were then overtaken by foreign multinational companies (Unilever and Procter & Gamble, for example), and then by Indian MNCs with big aspirations (like ITC), and finally followed by the “Baba companies” such as the one Patanjali Ayurved represents. Over each phase, basic FMCG offerings have strived to shed the commodity nature by hiking prices and imagery, and product compositions have gone as inorganic as they can. The Baba companies, led by Patanjali, for now, re-invent the commodity once again, with a holistic spin. And lo and behold, you have a very no-frills offering that promises the good old way of healthy living with healthy options. The price label is a further dose of consumer delight. Patanjali’s success is intrinsically attached to Baba Ramdev. He is not a passive guru. Add to it the fact that he wears saffron, a colour that’s the flavour of the decade in India today. Controversy is his middle name. He is often aggressive, and wears his heart on his sleeve. This endears him to a large part of the masses who will be his consumers. Patanjali Ayurved without Baba Ramdev is just another company. The company has set off shivers in corporate boardrooms in India. And rightfully so. Companies such as Dabur and Himalaya have offered ayurvedic products for long. How come their imagery is not as hot as Patanjali Ayurved? New Delhi Jolly, products that come with a spiritual guru as its brand endorser at the top do better in this category. The idea is a simple one. This is not a corporate product, it is one put together with the care and supervision of a Guru. That seems to work in India. Small is beautiful and big is routine. This is why Patanjali Ayurved with Baba Ramdev does better than the Baidyanaths and Daburs of the world in terms of imagery.

REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo LONDON GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) has promoted a former Novartis (NOVN.S) executive to lead its consumer healthcare business, following the appointment last week of the unit's previous head, Emma Walmsley, as CEO designate of the drugmaker. The British group said on Thursday that Brian McNamara, 50, who currently heads up Europe and the Americas at GSK Consumer Healthcare, would take on his new role immediately and join GSK's corporate executive team. McNamara worked for 11 years at Novartis, where he was also in charge of consumer health, and joined GSK following the creation of a joint venture between the two companies in 2015. Prior to that he spent 16 years at Procter & Gamble (PG.N). The swift management transition will ensure the consumer business remains focused on improving financial performance and will allow Walmsley to focus on her new role as incoming CEO, a spokesman said. She will officially take the helm at the end of March on the retirement of current CEO Andrew Witty, becoming the first woman to lead a top global drugmaker. Separately, GSK said it had disposed of the final portion of its stake in Aspen Pharmacare (APNJ.J), Africa’s biggest generic drugmaker, after seven years as an investor in the company. Its gross proceeds from the sale of the remaining 6.2 percent holding were 477 million pounds ($621 million).

It is now a short and I am going to take the trade. I have been patiently watching this stock chart, waiting for this to happen. It did today. A gap fill on a stock chart is one of the highest percentage plays available to stock chart traders. In this case, price moved higher into the gap fill which is major resistance. Price should fall back now, and trade lower. The downside target is $84 then $75. This article was written by Jenny Rebekka for on .

He joins the agency following a year and a half as a senior level integrated strategy and business stewardship consultant with S.I.N.K. Consulting in Brooklyn. Before that he spent two years with Publicis’ PKT and MSLGROUP as senior vice president, integrated/digital/social strategy, working with clients such as P&G and L’Oreal-Garnier. Kraft’s previous agency jobs include a stint as senior group strategy consultant with Grey New York, where he worked with brands including the NFL, Pantene, Downy, TJ Maxx and Goya, and a senior strategy director role at Leo Burnett. He also brings client-side experience to the Vitro gig: for three years he was CMO for Real Club Resorts, or “Mexico’s largest domestic beach hotel group in Cancun, Playa del Carmen and Tulum.” Kraft has also worked as an adjunct professor and advisor at NYU’s School of Professional Studies.  The appointment comes after Vitro won AOR duties on Adidas Golf at the beginning of the summer; that news followed the departures of executive creative directors Kt Thayer and Oliver Duncan a month prior. Earlier this year, ASICS shifted its global creative business to 180 Amsterdam and 180LA from the agency and Vitro opened a new office in Austin, hiring GSD&M’s Jake Camozzi and Victor Camozzi to run its creative department. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Social Media Computers & Laptops Mobiles & Tablets Other Gadgets ​L&T Technology Services to focus on top 30, adjacent customers Rajesh Kurup   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Keshab Panda, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, LTTS Mumbai, Sept 28:   L&T Technology Services Ltd (LTTS), Larsen & Toubro’s engineering and research and development arm, is to focus more on its top 30 customers who contribute 65 per cent of its revenues. The company will also concentrate on adjacent companies that work in the same space as its clients. This is under the company’s policy, T-30 and A-3, which came into effect in April 2016, LTTS Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Keshab Panda told BusinessLine​ in an interview. LTTS revenues from T-30 accounts stood at 65 per cent of the total in FY16, which is expected to grow at the same or a higher pace this year, he said, declining to provide “futuristic” statements. Some of the top customers for LTTS are Danaher, Scania, UTC, P&G, John Deere and BMW, among others, according to the Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) filed with market regulator SEBI. The company has developed Internet of Things (IoT) solutions such as UbiqWeise and iBEMS in emerging technology areas to support its customers, Panda said. LTTS has also tied up with Intel as its go-to-market partner for its smart buildings platform, iBEMS, which enables Net-Zero, energy generation management, predictive and preventive maintenance to help steer-away from energy consumption to energy generation and helps customers save up to 40 per cent of energy costs. Using UBIQWeise, LTTS has designed a smart connected thermostat that is WiFi capable and controls all aspects of indoor air leveraging IoT, cloud and mobility solutions. This solution has been rolled out in the North American market, Panda said. For the company, Europe and the US is about 80 per cent of the market, and these geographies are expected to grow on a revenue basis even though it could be steady on a percentage basis. The company is also looking at focusing more on Japan and Korea in Asia, he said, adding LTTS does “very little work” in West Asia, while exposure in the UK is close to zero. MONETISING PATENTS Further, LTTS has 168 patents of which 34 are owned by the company and 134 are co-authored with global clients. The company is also looking to monetise them. “We will look at monetising the patents, which are filed across different geographies.” However, he did not give a time line for the monetisation. LTTS debuted on September 23, following a $134-million initial public offering (IPO). The Rs 900-crore IPO of L&T Technology Services was oversubscribed 2.53 times during September 12-15. The price band for the offer was fixed at Rs 850-860. This is the second company from the L&T group to hit the market with an IPO since July, when L&T Infotech had launched a public offer. The flagship Larsen and Toubro is already listed.

Sections Deseret NewsOpinion Opinion Derek B. Miller: Utah lost Facebook but can still save face By Derek B. MillerFor the Deseret News Published: Sept. 28, 2016 12:10 a.m. Updated: Sept. 27, 2016 7:23 p.m. 5 Comments In case you missed it amidst the status updates, news feed, likes, photos and pokes, Facebook has made its long-awaited decision. The company that created modern social networking and connected the world in ways heretofore unknown will build its massive data center in New Mexico, not Utah. The project had the potential to bring up to $1.5 billion in capital investment to Utah and would have joined a long list of notable companies that have moved to the Beehive State, including Proctor & Gamble, Adobe, Goldman Sachs, eBay, Boeing and many more. In the corporate recruitment world where success begets success and reputation matters, this loss has consequences. In the long run, there are lessons to be learned that if ignored will produce an even greater loss. The first lesson is it’s better to risk losing a recruitment project than to become the casualty of a bidding war of incentives between competing locations. Some decry the use of any incentives from state and local governments. There is no doubt that in an economist’s utopia, incentives would be unnecessary, but we don't live in that perfect world. The reality is states compete for the jobs and investment that come with corporate recruitment projects. In a free market, companies have choices on where to do business, and the resulting competition means states that want to attract jobs must produce a skilled workforce, stable business environment and high quality of life. This healthy competition goes off track when locations get into an incentives bidding war. We saw this beginning to happen when New Mexico sweetened an already enticing offer of 100 percent tax rebate with an additional $10 million subsidy. A state with strong "natural" incentives of well-educated employees, low taxes and reasonable regulations should not have to play that kind of game when recruiting companies. If a state wins every recruitment project, it is an indication that the financial incentives may be too rich. Losing a project now and then helps a state to be reflective and refine the incentives process. The second lesson is incentive parameters must be determined before negotiations begin. It is risky to try to figure out how far is too far during the heat of the moment, when emotions are heightened and the party sitting across the table can get the better of you. The Facebook recruitment clearly suffered from internal disagreement on how much incentive was acceptable. The city made an offer. The county disagreed. And the school board approved something in the middle. Having your internal negotiations play out in the public forum is not an effective way to win deals. For any company looking to relocate, no amount of financial incentive is ever enough. By nature the company will always want more. This is why it is important to have parameters set on your side of the table before you start negotiating. The third lesson is all partners must get and stay on the same page. There's no shame in losing a recruitment project when it becomes a "dialing for dollars" exercise and the company is simply searching for the highest bidder. Losing a project because of internal misunderstandings is a different matter, especially when it spills onto the front page of the paper. Elected and community leaders in Utah rightly tout our economic development “secret sauce” as our willingness to cooperate and ability to collaborate. Utah’s secret sauce has produced a long string of great results under the leadership of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, supported by the Economic Development Corporation of Utah, in coordination with local counties and cities. The Facebook project was an unfortunate loss but gratefully a rare exception. Learning from the loss will help ensure this exception does not become a pattern. Derek B. Miller is the president and CEO of the World Trade Center Utah. Previously he was chief of staff to Gov. Gary Herbert and managing director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development. 5 Comments Like that? Read this.

American botanist Luther Burbank once said flowers make people happier and more helpful. They are sunshine, he said, as well as food and medicine for the soul. Marilyn Johnson Aardema might just be the personification of that. The retired Procter & Gamble scientist took early retirement seven years ago at the very young age of 50 to do, well, what so many of us only dream of. She wanted to do something completely different without having to do it. She wished to bring joy to others. Her other requirement: Have a blast and be surrounded by beauty. And, get this, she didn’t need – nor does she really want – to make money at it. The idea, which she read about somewhere, seemed so simple that she was certain someone here was doing it: recycle wedding arrangements into smaller bouquets to give to nonprofits. She figured she would volunteer for the folks doing that here. Except “they” weren’t. “It was just such a no-brainer idea,” Johnson Aardema said in the sitting area of her home that overlooks lovely shade gardens and woods tucked into a northern suburb. Marilyn Johnson Aardema  (Photo: Provided) So she took matters into her own hands and reached out to another woman, who also shifted careers in her 50s, for a bit of advice both about taking a life leap and the art of floral arranging. First, Robin Wood, the owner of Evanston-based Robin Wood Flowers, told her she wasn’t crazy. Second, she told her it was a great idea. And finally, she said she would help promote it. With that, ReBloom was born, turning something old into something new again. Instead of dumping literally tens of thousands of dollars of exquisite floral arrangements in a dumpster after a wedding reception – which is generally what happens – some area brides opt to use ReBloom and have Johnson Aardema or her volunteers pick up their flowers and repurpose them. Buy Photo A cart full of flowers wait by the loading dock of the Cincinnati Art Museum Saturday, September 24, 2016. The flowers were used at a wedding the previous evening and will be repurposed as part of ReBloom, a volunteer organization in partnership with Robin Wood Flowers that repurposes donated flowers after weddings and delivers them to hospital patients and other nonprofit organizations in Greater Cincinnati.  (Photo: The Enquirer/Meg Vogel) The brides can write off a portion of their floral expense – which can run between $5,000 to $20,000 and as high as $50,000 or $60,000 – as a tax-deductible contribution. Wood, the former WEBN-FM (102.7) morning radio host and Channel 12 reporter turned floral-artist-businesswoman, is the connector: She mentions ReBloom to brides when they hire her to design and decorate for their wedding and reception. Wood then leaves it to the brides and Johnson Aardema to do the rest. “All that money, all that beauty. It’s really great when she is able to do this,” Wood said. Johnson Aardema, 57, and her tiny team of volunteers – her adult daughter, her dad and a few friends – arrange a pickup time for the flowers. From there, she heads home with plastic bins overflowing with luscious greens, roses bursting open, and dahlias, hydrangea and multiple varieties of exotic flowers at their peak. She or her volunteer, Cathleen Fagan, then pull apart the centerpieces and huge displays, snip the stems and pull off any browning vegetation and reassemble them into their own works of living art. And while they save dozen of flowers, some still end up in the dumpster because stems are too short to re-vase and some, if a venue hasn’t put them in a cooler overnight, have already started to wilt. But most recycled arrangements look great for at least three to five more days, she said. Her little business makes only enough money to pay for her gasoline, supplies and the thrift-store vases that she refuses to pay more than 69 cents for by the way. She operates out of a corner of her garage. And that’s how she likes it. Wood said most brides love the idea. But because ReBloom is a tiny enterprise, it is often difficult to match the reception dates to volunteer availability, as Johnson Aardema’s consulting business often takes her out of town. She estimated ReBloom will do about 10-13 weddings a year. Wood said she could easily send more business to her, if Johnson Aardema could handle it. “It’s a small kind of thing,” she said. “I really want to keep it interesting and fun.” She and her daughter take their ReBloom arrangements in the lobby of Mercy Health-Fairfield Hospital, which is near her home. They used to deliver the arrangements directly to patient rooms. But now, they greet empty-handed visitors with the flowers. “It is just instant gratification,” she said. “This way we bring joy to the person who picks up the flowers and then get the joy of giving them to their patient.” Buy Photo Cathleen Fagan fills new vases to make repurposed arrangements as part of ReBloom. Fagan usually delivers to the 15 residents who live in Elm Street Senior Housing in Over-the-Rhine.  (Photo: The Enquirer/Meg Vogel) Fagan, who lives Downtown and is active is several Over-the-Rhine nonprofits, takes the flowers to her rooftop terrace to do her arranging – usually on Sunday morning – and delivers them to about 15 residents living in Elm Street Senior Housing. All the recipients are delighted with the arrangements. But one woman who battled cancer for years and received one of the ReBloom arrangements at the hospital holds a special place in Johnson Aardema’s heart. Years later, she died and her husband contacted Johnson Aardema to carry out his wife’s wish: She wanted the sprays from her funeral to be repurposed for others at the hospital. They met in the parking lot of Kohl’s. They hugged. She cried. Then she took the flowers and got to work.

Clorox is a well-diversified company that seems to be firing on all cylinders -- but is its price tag too high to make this a good investment? Seth McNew (TMFMcNew) Sep 29, 2016 at 10:00AM Image source: The Clorox Company. The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) has been a great investment over the last few decades, and could continue to be due to its brand strength, impressive earnings growth, and increasing dividend. But at 25 times earnings, is the stock too expensive? Clorox segment and brand strength  This century-old company is a lot more than just the home-cleaning brand its name suggests, offering nearly 20 brands such as Glad and Burt's Bees. Most of the company's growth comes through acquisitions, which is how it has diversified across so many different segments from home care to other lifestyle products like body care. According to Clorox's website, more than 80% of the company's sales are generated by brands that hold first- or second-place market share in their respective categories.  Segment Product Examples Portion of Total Sales Household Febreze, GladWare, Fresh Scoop cat litter, Brita water filters 38% Cleaning Clorox disinfecting wipes, laundry soap 31% Lifestyle Burt's Bees, Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressings 16% International All products sold outside of the U.S. 15% Data source: Clorox's 2016 earnings call.  For the fiscal year 2016 ended June 30, Clorox reported 2% sales growth, to $5.8 billion. The company noted that international currency headwinds were largely to blame for lackluster sales growth, and that excluding the effects of these foreign exchange fluctuations, sales would be up 5%. Sales picked up slightly in the fourth quarter, to 3% growth year over year; perhaps more important is that volume increased by 7% over the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with 4% for the full year. Clorox has an impressive history of developing products, both via internal development and by acquiring and growing new brands. Clorox is currently working on a "2020 strategy" which is meant to boost overall market share through improvements in each category. "We are very pleased with our fiscal year 2016 performance and the progress we are making against our Strategy 2020 accelerators," said CEO Benno Dorer during the earnings conference call, "which I believe will continue to create value and drive long-term profitable growth in the years to come." Image source: The Clorox Company. Impressive earnings growth Earnings grew at a much faster rate than sales as earnings per share (EPS) climbed 12% year over year to $4.92. Clorox has continued to grow earnings impressively over each of the last five years. For fiscal year 2017, Clorox projects earnings per share in the range of $5.38 to $5.58, which would be a 9% to 13% increase over 2016. That's substantial growth for a blue-chip stock like Clorox.  CLX Normalized Diluted EPS (Annual) data by YCharts. Clorox's rising dividend Clorox's dividend history is another reason the stock looks attractive. Its dividend is $3.20 per share ($0.80 per quarter), for a 2.5% yield at the current price. That dividend has nearly tripled in the last decade, though the yield has stayed relatively even because of share price growth at the same time. Clorox has shown itself to be an income generator, and is likely to continue growing this dividend for years to come: CLX Dividend data by YCharts. But is the stock too expensive? Clorox stock has been a great investment in the past, especially in the last five years as the stock has more than doubled. But as the share price has grown, so has the stock's valuation, which is now around 25 times earnings. Compare that to its three biggest competitors, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Unilever (NYSE:UL):   Clorox Colgate P&G Unilever Market cap $16.3 billion $65.5 billion $235.9 billion $134.4 billion Most recent quarter sales growth (YOY) 2% (5.5%) (3%) (3.2%)  Most recent quarter EPS growth (YOY) 12% 6.3% (15%) 1%  Dividend yield  2.5% 2.1% 3% 3% P/E (TTM) 25.6 47.3 23.9 24.5  Data sources: Company earnings releases, Yahoo! Finance. YOY = year over year; TTM = trailing twelve-month. Clorox was the only company of those above to report rising earnings during the most recent quarter (in real dollars, not altering results to remove the effect of foreign currency swings) and also has the most impressive EPS growth. Its dividend is closely in line with its peers and has been growing substantially in the past decade. With the promise of solid execution of the company's 2020 strategy, Clorox stock seems reasonably priced, and continues to look like a solid long-term holding.  Seth McNew has no position in any stocks mentioned.

McNamara, 50, will take on the new role immediately, enabling Walmsley to focus on preparing to succeed Chief Executive Officer Andrew Witty. McNamara will report to Witty until Walmsley takes the top job in March, according to a statement Thursday. The London-based drugmaker last week ended months of speculation on who will succeed Witty, but also sparked new questions over who would lead its consumer-health division and whether Walmsley will stick to Witty’s strategy. Witty, who announced his retirement in March, has come under fire from investors for his approach, which emphasized diversification into products like toothpaste and over-the-counter painkillers as well as volume-based growth, particularly in emerging markets. McNamara oversaw business in Europe and the Americas at Glaxo’s consumer-health division. He joined the company last year from Novartis AG following completion of Glaxo’s three-part asset swap with the Swiss drugmaker. McNamara spent eleven years at Novartis, where he started off in 2004 as senior vice president of the North America over-the-counter business. Before that, he spent sixteen years at Procter & Gamble Co. He will join Glaxo’s executive team effective immediately and will continue as a member of the board of the consumer-health joint venture with Novartis. An American, he will be based in the U.K. McNamara has a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from Union College and a master’s in business administration from the University of Cincinnati. He is a father of three, an avid mountain climber and enjoys skiing. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

She was 93. Nixon got her start in daytime serials thanks to her father's inadvertent assistance, the Los Angeles Times says. He was actually trying to convince her not to launch a writing career, hoping she would follow him into the burial garments business, when he set up a meeting with a pioneer in radio serial writing, Irna Phillips, to convince his daughter that her dream was foolish. But Phillips enjoyed Nixon's sample script so much, she asked her to come work for her. "It was one of the greatest moments of my life," Nixon said. "It was freedom." During the 1950s and 1960s, Nixon helped launch As the World Turns, was head writer of Guiding Light, and helped turn around Another World. She was ahead of her time, giving a Guiding Light character in 1962 uterine cancer, but CBS and sponsor Proctor & Gamble agreed to let the storyline air only if the words "cancer," "uterus," and "hysterectomy" were not used. She later formed a company with her husband to produce One Life to Live, Loving, and All My Children; she based the latter show's villain, Adam Chandler, on her father, and gave Erica Kane, her favorite character, abandonment issues like she thought she had, the Times reports. In 1981, she became the first woman to receive the Trustees Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, and in 2010, she was honored with a Daytime Emmy for lifetime achievement. Nixon's husband died in 1996. She is survived by her children Cathy, Mary, Robert, and Emily, and 11 grandchildren. Catherine Garcia   All My Children creator Agnes Nixon dies at 93 September 28, 2016 this is fine Edit David Duke is delighted by Trump's selection of Flynn, Bannon, and Sessions 11:16 a.m. ET   Former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke thinks President-elect Donald Trump's choice of Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn as his national security adviser is a "great pick." Duke, who previously served as a Louisiana state representative and who ran for Senate in Louisiana this year, tweeted Thursday night that Flynn clearly knows who the "real enemies" are. Duke included a message Flynn retweeted in July as evidence: Great Pick! - Gen. Flynn's retweet shows he knows that the Saudis, ISIS & the Jewish-NeoCons are the real enemies - NOT Assad & NOT Russia! pic.twitter.com/Z9D9CHHXeQ — David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) November 18, 2016 Flynn took a lot of flak for that retweet, which was in response to a claim made by Hillary Clinton's campaign manager during an appearance on CNN that Russia was behind the hack of Democratic National Committee emails. Flynn later apologized for the retweet, which he said was a "mistake," and a Republican National Committee spokesperson said in a comment to The Guardian that "there is no place in the Republican Party for anti-Semitic comments." Flynn wasn't the only Trump appointee to get Duke's stamp of approval. Duke tweeted twice to applaud Trump's choice of Breitbart News' Steve Bannon as White House chief strategist and Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions as attorney general. Becca Stanek Bannon, Flynn, Sessions -- Great!

Jeff Sessions, lost an appointment to the federal bench after a 1986 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which witnesses accused Sessions of being too racist for the job. Sessions denied the charges: "I am not a racist, I am not insensitive to blacks," he has said. Here are seven times his critics have disagreed. Jeva Lange 1. "On the day in question, Mr. Sessions came into my office just as I was reading a newspaper account of some recent action of the NAACP. I casually mentioned that development to Mr. Sessions. Mr. Sessions in response stated that he believed the NAACP, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Operation PUSH, and the National Conference of Churches were all un-American organizations teaching anti-American values. This statement clearly was not intended as a joke." [Assistant U.S. attorney Thomas Figures] 2. "One African-American prosecutor testified that Mr. Sessions had called him 'boy' and joked that he thought that the Ku Klux Klan 'was okay until I found out they smoked pot.' Mr. Sessions denied calling the lawyer 'boy' but acknowledged or did not dispute the substance of the other remarks." [The New York Times] 3. "Things that I had heard firsthand from him were things that demonstrated gross racial insensitivity to black citizens of Alabama and the United States … He has never backed off from the comments he made at that time. He has never apologized for them." [Justice Department prosecutor J. Gerald Hebert] 4. "[It is] inconceivable … that a person of this attitude is qualified to be a U.S. attorney, let alone a United States federal judge … [He has] gross insensitivity to the questions of race." [Ted Kennedy] 5. "It is suggested that [Sessions] stated to Mr. Wiley at the conclusion of a particularly contentious hearing back in 1981, 'Do not worry,' or 'do not be too happy' … 'John,' meaning Archer, 'will be watching you and the n----r,' referring to the only black commissioner in Mobile." [Joe Biden] 6. "It is indeed a sad day for both the Congress and the country when a man like Jefferson Sessions … who has made overtly racist comments, could even be nominated for the federal bench." [Rep. John Conyers Jr.] 7. "Jeff Sessions, considered too racist to be a judge in '80s, is Trump's AG. Best to go back to sleep, America. I'll wake you up when it's over. [GOP strategist Ana Navarro]   7 times Jeff Sessions' critics accused him of racism 10:41 a.m. ISIS Crisis Edit ISIS teaches math by asking children to count bullets 10:31 a.m. ET   Marco Di Lauro/Getty Images When the Islamic State took over the northern Iraqi town of Qayyara in 2014, the terrorist organization briefly allowed local schools to function as usual. But soon the militants began banning subjects they didn't like — geography, history, civics — and replacing textbooks with tomes of their own making. The ISIS agenda was evident throughout their curriculum, which transformed schools for boys into recruiting stations. Even a subject as neutral as math was affected, with math problems asking children to imagine counting tools of war in their examples: "One bullet plus two bullets equals how many bullets?" The good news is that Qayyara has been ISIS-free for three months, ever since the militants were driven out earlier this year as part of the U.S.-supported Iraqi troops' push toward Mosul. Now, schools are getting back to normal — though that will be a long process thanks to a too-small teaching staff and some families' decision to simply pull their children out of class for the duration of the ISIS occupation.

"They wanted us to come but we didn't want to, because we don't know how to study in their language: the language of violence." Bonnie Kristian   ISIS teaches math by asking children to count bullets 10:31 a.m. making the case Edit The Wall Street Journal argues Trump should liquidate his business — or face some serious 'political damage' 10:09 a.m. ET   Alex Wong/Getty Images In an editorial published late Thursday, The Wall Street Journal laid out why President-elect Donald Trump's "best option" to avoid a perceived conflict of interest between his business and his government is to "liquidate his stake" in the Trump Organization. While Trump has floated the idea of a "blind trust," turning the company entirely over to his adult children, The Wall Street Journal joined critics of the idea in saying it won't be enough. Typically, The Wall Street Journal reported, a "blind trust" is an "independent manager, not family members," and the assets being protected generally aren't as highly visible as, say, Trump's array of properties and brands. These disparities have already raised eyebrows, and the Journal contends it will only get worse: The political damage to a new administration could be extensive. If Mr. Trump doesn't liquidate, he will be accused of a pecuniary motive any time he takes a policy position. For example, the House and Senate are eager to consider tax reform — and one sticking point will be the treatment of real estate, which will be of great interest to the Trump family business. Ditto for repealing the Dodd-Frank financial law, interest rates, and so much more. [The Wall Street Journal] As "painful and perhaps costly" as Trump's break-up with his businesses may be, the "presidential stakes are too high" for him to do anything else, the newspaper's editors conclude. Head over to The Wall Street Journal to read more about what troubles Trump's business could cause him.

Here's an idea: Don't find out who it is. A Georgia man named Joe Chandler has done exactly that, warding off election results by using headphones and wearing a sign that reads, "I don't know who won and don't want to. Please don't tell me." FoxNews: 'Don't tell me': Georgia man deliberately stays in the dark on election results https://t.co/Hd6oJQNmD5 pic.twitter.com/GTT3cky6N7 — Smart People (@wanthillaryout) November 17, 2016 Chandler decided to remain blissfully ignorant after seeing the stress the election caused his friends. "I was invited to an election party to stay up into the night with everybody gnawing their nails, hanging on, and I thought, 'Oh, there has to be a better way,'" he explained. He originally intended to check the results the next morning but gradually kept putting the moment off to preserve the calm of not knowing. Chandler, who works from home and did not particularly like either major-party candidate, is pleased with his choice. "Having subtracted myself from this political fracas and all of the mayhem of the digital media, I kind of found the center of the cyclone," he says. "It is very peaceful in my bubble of ignorance."

One White House source told The New Yorker that when meeting with staffers the day after the election, Obama and his chief of staff, Denis McDonough, were "almost like grief counselors." But there was perhaps an even tougher conversation Obama needed to have: the one with his daughters, Malia and Sasha. Obama revealed what he wanted them to know in an interview with The New Yorker: "What I say to them is that people are complicated,” Obama told me. “Societies and cultures are really complicated. ... This is not mathematics; this is biology and chemistry. These are living organisms, and it's messy. And your job as a citizen and as a decent human being is to constantly affirm and lift up and fight for treating people with kindness and respect and understanding. And you should anticipate that at any given moment there's going to be flare-ups of bigotry that you may have to confront, or may be inside you and you have to vanquish. And it doesn't stop. ... You don't get into a fetal position about it. You don't start worrying about apocalypse. You say, okay, where are the places where I can push to keep it moving forward." [The New Yorker] Obama himself admitted, though, that he doesn't "believe in apocalyptic — until the apocalypse comes. I think nothing is the end of the world until the end of the world."

Jeva Lange   This is what Obama wanted his daughters to know after Hillary Clinton lost the election 9:51 a.m. what next Edit Will Democrats filibuster Trump's Supreme Court nominee? If they do, the GOP might nuke the filibuster. 8:46 a.m. ET   Joe Raedle/Getty Images Democrats are squirming at the thought of Donald Trump's upcoming opportunity to nominate a justice for the Supreme Court. And while they're thinking about giving the Republicans a taste of their own medicine by obstructing any nominee, it could come with a potentially crippling cost. The Democrats are still smarting over their counterparts' treatment of President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland, who despite being nominated in February has still not gotten a congressional confirmation hearing. But payback in the form of a filibuster of Trump's nominee could cost Democrats the tools they have left as a minority, Politico reports. Currently, the Senate requires a 60-vote minimum to confirm a Supreme Court nominee, a practice that the Republicans have threatened to end if the Democratss don't play ball. "We're going to confirm the president's nominee one way or the other. And there's an easy way and there's a hard way," Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) has said. It's an open question as to how Democrats will proceed. They'll be under immense pressure from their political base to reject a nominee perceived as anti-abortion and anti-environment. They'll also have to weigh whether playing nice on one nominee may give them more leverage to play hardball later on, when Republicans may be sweating their own political future ahead of the 2020 election [...] Democrats say it's too early to decide how they'll proceed. But they admit they're worried about who Trump will pick and what it will mean for the future of the Senate.

BlackBerry — BlackBerry reported a breakeven quarter, surprising analysts who had expected a five cents per share loss. Revenue was well below forecasts, however, and the maker of mobile phone software also announced the departure of its chief financial officer, James Yersh. Deutsche Bank — CEO John Cryan told a German newspaper that the bank did not need any government assistance or a capital increase. The shares have been under pressure on worries that an anticipated multibillion-dollar fine from the U.S. Justice Department could damage the bank's finances.

Twitter — Mizuho downgraded Twitter to "underperform" from "neutral" on a valuation basis, saying it was skeptical about most of the takeover rumors circulating through Wall Street. Alphabet — Wedbush downgraded the Google parent's stock to "underperform" from "neutral," on a variety of concerns about future monetization of online search. Cintas — Cintas earned an adjusted $1.26 per share for its latest quarter, 17 cents a share above estimates. The uniform maker's revenue was slightly above forecasts.

Sonic — The fast food chain projected current-quarter earnings below current Wall Street consensus, citing slower customer traffic and lower spending at its restaurants. Coty — Coty will replace Diamond Offshore in the S&P 500, which is moving to the S&P MidCap 400.

He was in Cleveland urging people to get out and vote for Hillary Clinton. (Joshua Gunter, cleveland.com) By  Jeremy Pelzer, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Email the author Follow on Twitter on September 28, 2016 at 6:20 AM Print Email Bill Clinton campaigns for his wife in Cleveland and Toledo. Donald Trump highlights Ohio's economic "devastation." And Rob Portman's campaign gets tech-savvy. Today's Ohio Politics Roundup is brought to you by Jeremy Pelzer.    Bill Clinton campaigns in Cleveland: On the heels of Hillary Clinton's first presidential debate with Donald Trump, ex-President Bill Clinton visited Cleveland's Ginn Academy on Tuesday to pump up energy for his wife's campaign. Cleveland.com's Mary Kilpatrick has the story. Clinton lightly criticized free trade deals... Campaigning in Toledo earlier in the day, Clinton "acknowledged that the international trade deals have not always worked out as well as planned," according to the Toledo Blade's Tom Troy. Clinton, who signed NAFTA in 1993, "blamed poor enforcement and what he called things that happened outside the trade deal." ...while Trump's criticism may have gone too far: During the first presidential debate Monday, Trump offered Ohio as an example of how free-trade policies have created economic "devastation" and sent American jobs overseas. But as Chrissie Thompson of the Cincinnati Enquirer writes, Ohio's reality "is far more nuanced." While Ohio has lost manufacturing jobs, overall employment in the state has steadily climbed since 2010 – though, on the other hand, non-manufacturing jobs tend to pay less.  Ohio shout-out: Trump's repeated name-dropping of Ohio during the debate was no accident, explains the Dayton Daily News' Jessica Wehrman – the GOP nominee appealed directly to anti-free trade voters in a state he feels he can win. But as Mark Caleb Smith of Cedarville University told Wehrman, such talk could also alienate well-educated suburban mothers and those still on the fence. For more analysis of Monday's debate: Check out a Facebook Live discussion with cleveland.com politics reporters Henry J. Gomez and Andrew J. Tobias. What did you think of the debate? If you live in Cuyahoga County, take our post-debate Battleground Cuyahoga poll. As cleveland.com's Mary Kilpatrick notes, cleveland.com and Baldwin Wallace University asked the same questions before the debate, and we want to see what's changed. Coal country digs Trump: "Southeastern Ohio, which has been slowly turning away from Democrats, appears poised to back Donald Trump and his talk on trade, manufacturing jobs and coal," reports the Columbus Dispatch's Jim Siegel. "Trump nearly swept the region over Gov. John Kasich in the Republican primary in March, and he appears headed for a repeat against Hillary Clinton — who seemingly would appeal to traditional working-class voters." Nerd alert: The Associated Press' Julie Carr Smyth has an interesting look at how U.S. Sen. Rob Portman's campaign has taken advantage of digital technology, from data mining to online ads. Portman's well-funded campaign has used voter databases and online ads early and often, allowing it to tailor ads to individual voters and win over hard-to-reach younger viewers. Bad news for Strickland, part 1: The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has canceled another week's worth of TV ad reservations on behalf of Democratic Senate nominee Ted Strickland, according to the Columbus Dispatch's Jack Torry. The move, which follows similar DSCC cancellations in recent weeks, means the DSCC only has ads booked for Strickland for the final two weeks before Election Day.  Bad news for Strickland, part 2: Meanwhile, pundit Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics has moved Ohio's U.S. Senate race rating from "Likely Republican" to "Safe Republican," noting Portman has a "massive resource advantage" and that Ted Strickland "has largely flamed out as a candidate." Power politics: Gov. John Kasich, speaking in Texas, again threatened to veto legislation that would kill the state's renewable-energy and energy-efficiency mandates, reports The Plain Dealer's John Funk. Kasich: "If you try to kill the standards, whether it has to do with the renewables or whether it has to do with the issue of saving energy, I'll veto the bill and we'll go to the higher standards." Sen. Bill Seitz of Cincinnati and other GOP lawmakers have sought to permanently end the mandates, which are currently frozen but will resume Jan. 1 unless lawmakers pass another bill. Statehouse popularity contest results are in: and Ohio's top legislative leaders didn't fare too well. As cleveland.com's Jackie Borchardt explains, a Columbus Monthly survey of more than 100 Capitol Square denizens found that Senate President Keith Faber won such dubious accolades as "most humorless" and "most arrogant," while House Speaker Cliff Rosenberger "barely registered" in the anonymous survey. Lawmakers who won top praise included state Sen. Bill Seitz (savviest, funniest, most knowledgeable, and best orator) and state Rep. Ryan Smith (most effective, hardest working, and tied for best listener). Water fight stops spending bill: Government authority to spend money will end Friday after the U.S. Senate rejected a stop-gap bill to provide funding into early December, writes cleveland.com's Steve Koff.  "The hangup Tuesday resulted from Democrats' demands that the continuing resolution include money for Flint, Michigan; Sebring, Ohio and other communities affected by dangerous levels of lead in their drinking water." But Senate offices said they were confident there will be no federal shutdown, which would reflect poorly on both parties as the November election approaches. Instead, lawmakers are likely to compromise on a short-term spending bill, or continuing resolution. Stop, in the name of jobs: "Some of Ohio's most prominent companies, including Procter & Gamble, Timken and Invacare, told President Barack Obama's administration today that regulations intended to crack down on corporate tax loopholes will harm businesses instead," Koff reports. The companies were among 47 corporations that wrote to Obama claiming that proposed rules to stop corporations from shifting their ownership to lower-tax companies – a so-called corporate inversion – "would significantly impede the ability of our businesses to invest and create jobs in Ohio." Tax tally: "The state of Ohio took in more tax money in 2015 than the previous year, but still ranks among the lowest taxing states," reports cleveland.com's Rich Exner. Each individual and corporation in Ohio, on average, paid $2,437 in state taxes and fees last year – 34th highest in the nation, and up about $100 per capita from 2014. Judge for yourself: If you're looking for information about judicial races this year, cleveland.com's Robert Higgs has the site for you: Judge4Yourself.com. The site, run by four Greater Cleveland bar associations, has info on candidates for Ohio Supreme Court and other state and county court seats. No Moore: Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore claims Newark's Midland Theater banned him from presenting a one-man show about the presidential race, according to the Dispatch's Jim Woods. Moore alleged theater management canceled his Oct. 7 show because they deemed him "too controversial." Theater management denied he was banned, though an official acknowledged they had "questions about potential controversy and the potential for disruptive events." Moore said he's arranged to hold his show early next month at another undisclosed venue in Southern Ohio.  Protests halt Columbus City Council meeting: Columbus City Council members evacuated their meeting Monday night after more than 100 protesters demanded justice for Tyre King, a 13-year-old killed by Columbus police, according to Rick Rouan of the Columbus Dispatch. The protesters' demands included ending a police summer safety initiative designed to target hot spots for crime, moving half of the city's police budget into other programs, and requiring independent investigations into police-involved shootings.

Clorox is a well-diversified company that seems to be firing on all cylinders -- but is its price tag too high to make this a good investment? Seth McNew (TMFMcNew) Sep 29, 2016 at 10:00AM Image source: The Clorox Company. The Clorox Company (NYSE:CLX) has been a great investment over the last few decades, and could continue to be due to its brand strength, impressive earnings growth, and increasing dividend. But at 25 times earnings, is the stock too expensive? Clorox segment and brand strength  This century-old company is a lot more than just the home-cleaning brand its name suggests, offering nearly 20 brands such as Glad and Burt's Bees. Most of the company's growth comes through acquisitions, which is how it has diversified across so many different segments from home care to other lifestyle products like body care. According to Clorox's website, more than 80% of the company's sales are generated by brands that hold first- or second-place market share in their respective categories.  Segment Product Examples Portion of Total Sales Household Febreze, GladWare, Fresh Scoop cat litter, Brita water filters 38% Cleaning Clorox disinfecting wipes, laundry soap 31% Lifestyle Burt's Bees, Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressings 16% International All products sold outside of the U.S. 15% Data source: Clorox's 2016 earnings call.  For the fiscal year 2016 ended June 30, Clorox reported 2% sales growth, to $5.8 billion. The company noted that international currency headwinds were largely to blame for lackluster sales growth, and that excluding the effects of these foreign exchange fluctuations, sales would be up 5%. Sales picked up slightly in the fourth quarter, to 3% growth year over year; perhaps more important is that volume increased by 7% over the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with 4% for the full year. Clorox has an impressive history of developing products, both via internal development and by acquiring and growing new brands. Clorox is currently working on a "2020 strategy" which is meant to boost overall market share through improvements in each category. "We are very pleased with our fiscal year 2016 performance and the progress we are making against our Strategy 2020 accelerators," said CEO Benno Dorer during the earnings conference call, "which I believe will continue to create value and drive long-term profitable growth in the years to come." Image source: The Clorox Company. Impressive earnings growth Earnings grew at a much faster rate than sales as earnings per share (EPS) climbed 12% year over year to $4.92. Clorox has continued to grow earnings impressively over each of the last five years. For fiscal year 2017, Clorox projects earnings per share in the range of $5.38 to $5.58, which would be a 9% to 13% increase over 2016. That's substantial growth for a blue-chip stock like Clorox.  CLX Normalized Diluted EPS (Annual) data by YCharts. Clorox's rising dividend Clorox's dividend history is another reason the stock looks attractive. Its dividend is $3.20 per share ($0.80 per quarter), for a 2.5% yield at the current price. That dividend has nearly tripled in the last decade, though the yield has stayed relatively even because of share price growth at the same time. Clorox has shown itself to be an income generator, and is likely to continue growing this dividend for years to come: CLX Dividend data by YCharts. But is the stock too expensive? Clorox stock has been a great investment in the past, especially in the last five years as the stock has more than doubled. But as the share price has grown, so has the stock's valuation, which is now around 25 times earnings. Compare that to its three biggest competitors, Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Unilever (NYSE:UL):   Clorox Colgate P&G Unilever Market cap $16.3 billion $65.5 billion $235.9 billion $134.4 billion Most recent quarter sales growth (YOY) 2% (5.5%) (3%) (3.2%)  Most recent quarter EPS growth (YOY) 12% 6.3% (15%) 1%  Dividend yield  2.5% 2.1% 3% 3% P/E (TTM) 25.6 47.3 23.9 24.5  Data sources: Company earnings releases, Yahoo! Finance. YOY = year over year; TTM = trailing twelve-month. Clorox was the only company of those above to report rising earnings during the most recent quarter (in real dollars, not altering results to remove the effect of foreign currency swings) and also has the most impressive EPS growth. Its dividend is closely in line with its peers and has been growing substantially in the past decade. With the promise of solid execution of the company's 2020 strategy, Clorox stock seems reasonably priced, and continues to look like a solid long-term holding.  Seth McNew has no position in any stocks mentioned.
