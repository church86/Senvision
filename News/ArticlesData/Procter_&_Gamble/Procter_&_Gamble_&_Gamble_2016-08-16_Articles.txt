Crunch Network The next $1 billion startup acquirer won’t be a tech company Posted Aug 16, 2016 by Alex Taussig (@ataussig) 0 SHARES Next Story Univision wins auction to acquire Gawker Media Alex Taussig Crunch Network Contributor Alex Taussig is a partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners focused on consumer technology. How to join the network Acquisitions starting with a “B” are not uncommon in the tech industry in Silicon Valley. Roughly two to four billion-dollar deals have gone down each quarter (on average) over the last few years. The recent purchases of Cruise Automation by GM and Dollar Shave Club by Unilever turned heads for another reason: The buyers were as non-techie as you can get. The Renaissance Center in Detroit  —  HQ of General Motors. Strategic prerogatives motivated both deals. For 108-year-old GM, the Cruise deal instantly makes it a contender in autonomous transportation — not an insignificant move for an automaker with little software DNA. For 86-year-old Unilever, the DSC deal allows it to compete more effectively on a direct-to-consumer basis with its nemesis, Procter & Gamble, which owns the shaving giant Gillette. Unilever HQ in Rotterdam, Netherlands. If the buyers had been Silicon Valley companies, these deals would be less remarkable. Instead, we find two “traditional” consumer product companies paying Silicon Valley prices for startups. And, of course, the buying streak continued with the purchase of Jet.com by Walmart for $3.3 billion, of which $3 billion is cash consideration. Will we see more old-line consumer businesses buying their way into innovation in the coming years? I think so. Examining the resources of those companies, it becomes evident that more deals of this type are possible, and, in fact, quite likely. I pulled public company data from the Fortune 500 list of the largest companies in the U.S. and filtered for categories like consumer goods, services and logistics. I then removed any companies with less than $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet, because startups are unlikely to take public company stock in a slower growing business in lieu of cold, hard cash. The chart below shows the cash balance and growth rate of the 31 remaining companies: Source: Public company filings via Sentieo and Yahoo Finance (7/30/2016). These companies have $133 billion of cash in total, with a median of $2.4 billion. Nine of these have greater than $5 billion of cash on hand:  Coca-Cola (KO), Procter & Gamble (PG), Pepsi (PEP), Walmart (WMT), UPS (UPS), Costco (COST), Nike (NKE) Disney (DIS) and Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA). To buy a company for $1 billion, these companies would spend less than 20 percent of their cash on hand. (Walmart spent more than one-third of its $8.7 billion of cash to buy Jet, so perhaps the list should be even longer!) Furthermore, their growth rates are anemic. The group’s median growth rate is 2.6 percent annually, which is a little more than double the rate of inflation and roughly one-seventh that of the “five tech horsemen”: Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). Nearly all the growth in the consumer space is therefore being fueled by software. It stands to reason that many of these 31 companies are thinking about what their software strategy is, or how they can use the internet to form more direct relationships with their customers. In the future, there may be a fuzzier line between a “consumer products” company and a “consumer technology” company. Related Articles What this year's M&A activity tells us about media and entertainment Why did Unilever pay $1B for Dollar Shave Club?   GM buys self-driving car kit startup Cruise, plans to use tech to make driverless cars Making that transition should be a scary proposition to many of these old-line businesses. It requires new products, fresh talent and the willingness to take risks and make big investments. Yet, the cash is there  —  $133 billion of it, to be precise. Using it to buy one’s way into the future doesn’t seem like a crazy idea. Of course, the cynical finance student in me knows that these deals are notoriously difficult to execute for large, slow-growing companies. GM trades at 0.66x its $158 billion in annual revenues, so it has two problems. First, almost any tech acquisition will be dilutive to its share price , which Wall Street hates. Second, to add even a percentage point to GM’s growth rate would require it to contribute $1.6 billion of new revenue from its target. Both of these problems seem intractable to a finance wonk analyzing the deal, and yet GM was able to pull off the Cruise deal. No doubt some very senior managers at GM had to put significant credibility on the line to get this deal done. Not every legacy consumer company will have the conviction that GM, Unilever or Walmart had in recent months, but some will. If you’re considering the M&A path for your company, my advice would be to start developing senior relationships at a number of these non-traditional acquirers today. You might be educating them about what the future could be like, but in a more capital-constrained environment like 2016, these players have the cash and motivation to make a deal happen. And, now a precedent exists.

Multimedia Today's Paper Topics ePaper WealthCheck SEARCH Follow Home News Markets Companies Money & Banking Economy Info-tech Opinion Specials Portfolio Catalyst BLink Auto focus Clean Tech Emerging Entrepreneurs Flight Plan India File India Interior Pulse Technophile Luxe New Manager Godrej Group Godrej Group - Enterprise, ethics: the two pillars of an empire Muthukumar K   ·   print   ·   T+  ·   T- Tweet Shashi Ashiwal / All B&W pictures courtesy: Godrej Archives Brand equity The Godrej corporate office in Vikhroli, Mumbai. The lock that opened the gates to an empire How the Godrej Group channelled the swadeshi spirit at home, and then went global In 1989, when the vestiges of the licence raj era still wove reams of red tape around Indian businesses, a management trainee at Godrej GE Appliances’ Faridabad office faced a dilemma. An excise tax collector wanted a Diwali “gift” delivered at his residence. “Or else…” After discussions with his seniors, the trainee turned up at the official’s house the next day with a gift-wrapped box. At the visitor’s insistence, the official unwrapped it, to find a pack of Godrej soaps in various fragrances. The unspoken but clear message: “The Godrej group is committed to ethical business. Don’t expect anything else from us.” The anecdote, narrated by Ranganatha Thota, the management trainee at that time, sums up an idea that Gurcharan Das, former CEO of Procter & Gamble India, has articulated: while India secured political independence in 1947, it got economic independence only with the 1991 reforms. In many ways, the business history of the Godrej Group, which dates back to 1897, mirrors the Independence movement. The group’s founder Ardeshir Godrej, as the Godrej Rhyme (at right) narrates and as BK Karanjia chronicles in his two-volume book Godrej: A hundred years 1897-1997, left India for Africa in 1889 to practise law. But unwilling to commit perjury to advance his career, he returned home, where the freedom movement was gathering pace, with the birth of the Indian National Congress in 1885.Swadeshi advocate Upon returning to India, Ardeshir became an early proponent of the swadeshi idea of economic self-reliance. An early venture to manufacture medical equipment failed owing to British protectionism, but the indefatigable entrepreneur cast his eye on lowly locks. The lock business was in the control of British and American manufacturers, but Ardeshir found a flaw in their products: their springs, used to work the levers, often gave way. Borrowing money to set up a shed in Lalbaug in Mumbai in 1897, he began making Anchor locks, which didn’t have springs. They were well-received in the market. From that, he went on to manufacture safes, again exposing a chink in the foreign-made safes, which rendered them unreliable. He patented the door frame, double-plate doors, and lock-case, and sold his safes at half the price of foreign brands. So successful was this business that even the Queen, while on a tour of India in 1912, availed of the services of a Godrej safe. Ardeshir, who had a Renaissance spirit that was always looking for new realms to conquer, then began manufacturing soap with vegetable oil, out of consideration for Hindu sentiments that disfavoured the use of animal fat. His soaps soon secured celebrity endorsements from Rabindranath Tagore, Dr Annie Besant and C Rajagopalachari. Despite the heavily skewed business landscape that protected British business interests, Godrej products held their own against multinationals. By the time he died in 1936, Ardeshir had expanded Godrej’s businesses into new areas. That year, Godrej & Boyce and Godrej Soaps posted revenues of ₹12 lakh and ₹6 lakh respectively. Consolidation phase Ardeshir’s younger brother Pirojsha, who succeeded him, focussed on consolidation rather than expansion into new areas. By Independence, the Group’s revenues had grown five times to ₹90 lakh. In 1948, the company secured permission to construct its first manufacturing plant on a large parcel of land that Pirojsha had acquired in Vikhroli (in current-day Mumbai). What it manufactured first was not locks or safes, but secure ballot boxes for independent India’s first elections in 1952. To showcase Indian prowess in manufacturing — the original ‘Make in India’ campaign! — Godrej diversified into making typewriters in 1953. Only four of the 1,800 components were imported; even these were soon being made at home. At the Congress session at Avadi, in Madras, Jawaharlal Nehru stooped over a Godrej typewriter to tip-tap a few words, signalling India’s early success in industrialisation. Pirojsha then ventured into making refrigerators; in 1958, the first Indian fridge came with a ₹1,885 tag. Pirojsha got his three sons on board: Sohrabji to look into overall marketing of Godrej products, Burjorji to look after soaps, and Naval to look into typewriters, refrigerators and hi-tech electronics.Going global The 1960s were a decade of two wars, a drought, and rampant inflation. In 1963, in the midst of that crisis, Burjorji’s son Adi Godrej took over the soaps business, which then had a turnover of ₹2.43 crore. This was the decade when the Group gained global footprint. After a couple of falst starts, it secured a foothold in Malaysia and, later, Singapore. By the 1970s, exports to western Europe picked up. Pirojsha passed away in 1972; by then, the third generation of the Godrej family was in the saddle, with Naval’s son Jamshyd heading the steel business, while Adi took Godrej soaps to new heights. By 1975, the group’s exports touched ₹22 crore. Inspired by Japanese processes, it introduced the Godrej Management System, to improve productivity and reduce inventories. The dawn of the 1980s was marked by fierce competition with Hindustan Lever in the soaps segment. “We needed big ideas to take on the competition and for the first time a male protagonist was used to promote a soap brand,” recalls adman Sam Balsara, who handled the Cinthol account. The campaign in 1985 featured Vinod Khanna on horseback and, later, Imran Khan. Both proved phenomenal hits.Post-1991 phase When the gale force of economic reforms came sweeping in 1991, Godrej was poised for take-off. In the 25 years since, the Group has grown into a $4.5 billion (₹30,000 crore) conglomerate, with an impressive global footprint. These 25 years have also seen the Group experiment, unsuccessfully, with joint ventures with GE, P&G, Sara Lee, Pillsbury and Hershey. And in 2008, when the global financial crisis dragged down economies, the Group, now into its fourth-generation leadership under Adi’s daughter Tanya Dubash, underwent a rebranding exercise to extend the brand appeal to young customers. Looking ahead, the Group plans to stick to its growth target of “10x in 10 years” (See Interview), growing both organically and through acquisitions. Industry analysts feel the Group will deliver. “They truly walk the talk,” says Nilesh Shah, Managing Director, Kotak Mutual Fund. It’s been 119 years since Ardeshir, the low-profile Parsi gentleman, implanted the Godrej flag in the land that adopted his Guderz tribe (from which the family name derives) that fled from Iran. In this time, the Godrej Group has established itself not only as an entrepreneurial success, but as a business that runs on strong ethical foundations.

It may sound like science fiction but tech that identifies VIP shoppers could soon be used for customer loyalty schemes Facial recognition already enables brands to count how many people have viewed their ads. Photograph: Matthew Lloyd/Getty Images Supported by About this content Sean Hargrave Wednesday 17 August 2016 07.30 EDT Last modified on Thursday 20 October 2016 06.27 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Whenever the future of advertising is discussed, thoughts often turn to the sci-fi image of a stalked Tom Cruise in Minority Report being recognised and served intrusive, personalised advertising as he tries to escape a futuristic city. Hence, recent claims by Russian app FindFace that it could identify people in public by their profile picture on a Russian social media site were met with a combination of awe and concern. Such facial recognition could enable digital screens to tailor messages to each individual as they pass, meaning an end to brands wasting budget advertising the wrong products to the wrong people. Facial recognition is already following celebrities’ pictures around online and providing advertising space next to them. Computer vision firm GumGum claims to be able to programme any face into its recognition system and then identifies it when it subsequently appears on the internet, even if there is no caption giving away the person’s identity. Typical customers are sponsors seeking to check up on what exposure a celebrity is earning them. “We’re currently working with P&G to recognise the athletes they’re using in their Thank You Mum Olympics campaign,” says GumGum managing director Ed Preedy. “We not only count how many pictures are posted of the athletes they work with, so they can see how much coverage they’ve attracted, but we can also let them serve an advert next to each picture.” Virtual reality: are you ready for surreal estate? Read more The VIP treatment Retailers are starting to see face recognition as a means of distinguishing their VIP customer loyalty schemes. At Axis, which develops facial recognition technology, business development manager Andy Martin points out facial recognition is already being used to enable advertisers to count how many people have viewed their outdoor advertising. The results are even split by gender and age. In a well-known outdoor campaign for domestic abuse charity Women’s Aid, a model’s bruises disappeared from her face as more people watched the screen, getting across the message that if people take notice, domestic violence could be halted. “Where I think we’ll start to move on and actually see people individually recognised is customer loyalty schemes,” says Martin. “We’re already working behind the scenes with some well-known retailers who are interested in spotting their loyal shoppers when they walk through the door. It would allow a sales assistant to be alerted and offer some a truly personalised shopping experience.” While customer loyalty might be the first opportunity, individual adverts, targeted through facial recognition, could be arriving sooner than you think. Robin Arnold, director at Digital Media Technologies, which consults on outdoor campaigns, has used camera technology in projects to enable digital posters to change when they are being watched. A recent example was a J20 advert in which an on-screen predator played a game of What’s the time Mr Wolf? with onlookers. He has also worked on campaigns where the technology was used to subtly personalise car adverts when an advertising screen’s camera spotted a driver of a rival brand. “The technology used number plate recognition software to find out what type of car [was] waiting at the lights and then changed the message on the digital screen,” he explains. “So, when the client was Renault they would spot a Citroën car and say something like, ‘Hey, Citroën driver, check out this Renault’. BMW used it to promote its X5 model when the system spotted people driving the equivalent Mercedes model.” The digital economy is outgrowing existing business ecosystems Read more Mood and gender targeting Will the next step in targeted advertising see brands recognise each person’s face and serve them a personalised message? Chris Pelekanou, commercial director at outdoor advertising company Clear Channel, reveals that experiments have been taking place to determine if adverts can be altered according to an onlooker’s mood. One recent public campaign from Plan International used a camera to deliver men and women different messages to underline the limited education choices for women in some countries. However, recognising each person would probably be a step too far. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A passerby looks at the M&C Saatchi Artificial Intelligence poster in Oxford Street London. Photograph: Laurence Gibson “You can’t do something just because the technology is there, you have to be led by the consumer and not the technology,” he says. “If we did start recognising people en masse then I think outdoor would have the same problem that digital display is having with people getting fed up and install ad blockers.” Social offers However, Andy Pringle, head of performance media at digital marketing agency Performics suggests that we are entering a period where we should think of marketing as “add-vertising”. Give a customer something extra and they may well give permission to be recognised. “It’s the kind of thing you can imagine being used in customer loyalty but also social media,” he says. “You can imagine brands asking people to give permission to be recognised in return for offers while they’re out and about. Say, there’s a guy waiting for a bus for ages in front of digital screen running a beer campaign. If that person likes that brand on Facebook you can foresee either the screen saying “hi” and giving him or her a voucher code for a free beer or triggering a voucher to be delivered to their Facebook inbox.” Too many faces, too many laws That kind of facial recognition is going to be far more likely than the sci-fi image of all advertising being individually tailored, according to Scott Ross, CTO at advertising agency DigitasLBi. He suggests those who imagine facial recognition happening en masse should consider exactly how much computing power would be needed. “Just on an escalator at a tube station you’d need to recognise a hundred people at the same time,” he says. “And each of those faces would have to be retrieved from a database of millions in the split second it takes them to pass from one screen to another. It’s a possibility but highly unlikely.” As one would imagine, it’s not only a technological issue but a legal one. Nick Johnson, partner at Osborne Clarke and member of its advertising law team, points out that the law is moving towards tougher opt-in rules as the EU general data protection regulation moves from approval to becoming law in May 2018. “The new data privacy laws are very specific about any biometrics belonging to a new, distinct type of data deemed as extra sensitive, alongside health and religion,” he says. “It means brands will need very clear, explicit opt-in permission in which they make it very clear exactly what will be done with the data and offer very clear choices to consumers to opt out. So, it’s a very sensitive area.” En masse, then, facial recognition looks to be a way off and will possibly never be accepted because of privacy concerns. However, as a special feature for customer loyalty schemes, recognition systems are already being tested behind closed doors. If you’re a high flyer, expect to be asked to be recognised soon: but if you are just one of the crowd, expect your face to be counted, but not recognised, next time you stop to stare at an ad on a digital screen.

The global liquid detergent chemicals market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 4.73% during the period 2016-2020. Commenting on the report, an analyst from the research team said: Shift toward concentrated liquid detergent formulations will be a key trend for market growth. Water scarcity is a growing environmental concern across the world, with only about 0.01% of the total water available for immediate consumption. So, vendors of liquid detergents, such as P&G, Unilever, and Henkel, are focusing on introducing concentrated liquid detergents. Compared to standard liquid detergents that have an average water content of 65%-70%, concentrated formats contain only 5%-50% water. According to the report, high demand for fragrance will be a key driver for market growth. The scent of the product is one of the leading factors influencing the purchase of household detergents.

(ATVI), Coty Inc (COTY) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks ATVI, COTY and LMT stock dished out more misery than most stocks did on Tuesday By James Brumley, InvestorPlace Feature Writer  |  Aug 16, 2016, 4:49 pm EST     Popular Posts: 10 Small-Cap Stocks That Could Double in 2017 Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Stock Is Due for Even BIGGER Gains 5 Retail Stocks That May Not Be Around Next Christmas Recent Posts: Eli Lilly and Co (LLY) Drug Failure Doesn’t Answer the Bigger Question The Dow Jones Is Completely Defying Expectations Why Medtronic PLC (MDT), Dycom Industries, Inc. (DY) and Palo Alto Networks Inc (PANW) Are 3 of Today’s Worst Stocks View All Posts Tepid inflation, solid housing starts and better-than-expected industrial productivity for July left investors a bit confused on Tuesday. Fanning the flames of indecision was the “wait and see” mindset in front of Wednesday’s release of the minutes from the most recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting. By the time the closing bell rang, the S&P 500 was back at 2178.15, down 0.55%, and ending the session near last week’s average closing level. Not every stock simply coasted lower on Tuesday, however. Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI), Coty Inc (NYSE:COTY) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) all logged much bigger losses, but for understandable reasons. Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI) In the grand scheme of things investors may worry about it too much — it’s not always relevant when a company insider sells a big chunk of his or her shares. It’s even less relevant when those shares are sold not so much to put the proceeds in someone’s pocket, but rather, as part of estate planning measures for someone else. All the same, shareholders were a bit rattled today when Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick and Chairman Brian Kelly sold $709 million worth of ATVI — almost half of their collective position — for estate planning purposes. The two still own more than 37 million shares of ATVI between them, or about $1.48 billion worth of the $29.7 billion company. The market still mostly interpreted it as a sign that the two top guys are losing faith in the firm. 7 Stocks to Sell or Short Into the Ground ATVI closed 5% lower on Tuesday. Coty Inc (COTY) Beauty product maker Coty was down close to 5% when the company acknowledged in its fourth-quarter results that the purchase of some now-former Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) has proven a bit costlier than expected. The good news is that Coty topped expectations for last quarter’s top and bottom line. The company earned an operating profit of 13 cents per share on $1.08 billion in sales, versus analyst estimates for earnings of 6 cents per share of COTY and revenue of $1.05 billion. The bad news is, the integration of P&G’s beauty brands like Hugo Boss fragrances and cosmetics brand Covergirl haven’t been cheap. The cost to hammer out the melding of the purchased assets doubled to a little more than $90 million last quarter, leaving COTY shareholders to wonder how much more unexpected cost is in the cards. Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) Activision Blizzard was hardly alone in the gutter today. Defense contractor Lockheed Martin also saw its shares fall by 4% when the company reported a recent spin-off had not borne the fruit it was supposed to. Is the End of Obamacare Nigh? The spin-off of Lockheed Martin’s IT business to Leidos was lauded when it was first unveiled in January. Information technology isn’t quite Lockheed’s milieu, and although it is profitable, it was a pain to operate. Most believed LMT would be better serviced by focusing on equipment, and even Lockheed Martin suggested cutting loose the unit would ultimately allow it to retire some LMT. As it turns out, not so much. The market was expecting the deal to lead to the retirement of 10 million shares of LMT, but when the details of spin-off were released with the official completion of the deal, the tally was only 9.4 million shares retired. As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

By Josh Kolm August 16, 2016 McCann’s newest additions, from left to right: Meghan Sherwin, Angela Gill, Jim Chestnutt and Jeff Perrin. McCann Canada has made another investment in strategy, planning and experiential with four additions to its Toronto office. Leading the hires is Meghan Sherwin as VP of strategic planning. Sherwin joined in May after nearly two years as VP of planning at Cheil Canada, having also had lengthy terms on the account teams at BBDO, Digital Cement and Leo Burnett. Among her credits are the “Kraft First Taste” program and the launch of the Gillette Proglide for P&G. Sherwin will report to Mary Chambers, chief strategy officer at McCann Canada. Her former position at Cheil was filled last month when the agency hired Scott Suthren from Innocean Worldwide Canada. “Meghan is a true integrated strategist, seamlessly moving through the worlds of traditional, digital, social, retail and events – simply building the best strategy for brands,” said Chambers in a release. The other three additions have joined the account team at Momentum, the agency’s experiential and engagement division. “Our team has been expanding rapidly due to tremendous organic growth and new business wins,” said Matt Lewis, managing director of Momentum Canada, who himself joined the agency earlier this year. “These newest additions to the team elevate our skill set across sponsorship, content and event production, but what we’re most excited about are the leadership qualities inherent in each of them.” Angela Gill has been hired as group account director at Momentum, having most recently been at SDI Marketing, where she helped launched the Rogers Hometown Hockey program. Gill has a mix of client- and agency-side experience, having previously worked as director of sponsorship strategy at Canadian Tire, group account director at Cossette, manager of marketing at CBC and manager of marketing programs at Molson Coors. Also joining Momentum are account directors Jim Chestnutt and Jeff Perrin. Chestnutt is an events producer with more than ten years of experience, having worked on events that helped to launch Nike.com and Miller Lite in Canada, as well as activations for RBC and Virgin Mobile. Perrin, most recently executive producer for the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television, has a background in live TV and talent management in addition to events and sponsorship, having worked on productions including The Canadian Country Music Awards, The Canadian Screen Awards and the Scotiabank Giller Prize, as well as a stint at Bristow Global Media as sponsorship director for W Network’s Hockey Wives. McCann also added to the Momentum team with three hires that came earlier this year as part of growth across all the agency’s departments. In March, the agency hired Josh Stein to be its new ECD in Toronto and, last month, gave a send off to the “MacLaren” name as it adopted the McCann Canada brand.

At 11:17 IST, the barometer index, the S&P BSE Sensex, was down 20.19 points or 0.07% at 28,132.21. The Nifty 50 index was down 12 points or 0.14% at 8660.15. The Sensex rose 46.70 points, or 0.17% at the day's high of 28,199.10 in morning trade. The index fell 61.55 points, or 0.22% at the day's low of 28,090.85 at the onset of trading session. The Nifty rose 10.20 points, or 0.12% at the day's high of 8,682.35 in morning trade. The index fell 25.05 points, or 0.29% at the day's low of 8,647.10 at the onset of trading session. The market breadth indicating the overall health of the market was negative. On BSE, 1,286 shares fell and 985 shares rose. A total of 118 shares were unchanged. The BSE Mid-Cap index was currently up 0.44%, outperforming the Sensex. The BSE Small-Cap index was currently down 0.04%. The decline in this index was lower than the Sensex's decline in percentage terms. In overseas markets, most Asian stocks edged lower as fresh record closing highs in US overnight failed to boost sentiment. All three main indices in the US closed at record high yesterday, 15 August 2016, thanks in part to a sharp uptick in oil prices, which boosted energy and materials shares. FMCG shares were in demand. Dabur India (up 1.05%), Colgate Palmolive (India) (up 1.04%), Marico (up 0.89%), Bajaj Corp (up 0.8%), Jyothy Laboratories (up 0.51%), Tata Global Beverages (up 0.51%), Hindustan Unilever (up 0.47%), Britannia Industries (up 0.42%), Godrej Consumer Products (up 0.36%), Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health Care (up 0.34%) and GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (up 0.27%), edged higher. Nestle India was down 0.85%. Pharmaceutical shares were mixed. Wockhardt (down 2.99%), IPCA Laboratories (down 2.08%), Strides Shasun (down 1.88%), Aurobindo Pharma (down 1.58%), Biocon (down 1.38%), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries (down 1%), Cadila Healthcare (down 0.85%), Alkem Laboratories (down 0.8%), Dr Reddy's Laboratories (down 0.22%) and GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals (down 0.06%), edged lower. Lupin (up 0.61%), Glenmark Pharmaceuticals (up 1.17%), Piramal Enterprises (up 4.34%) and Divi's Laboratories (up 5.39%), edged higher. Cipla shrugged off weak Q1 results. The stock was up 2.17% at Rs 527.85. The company's consolidated net profit fell 43.74% to Rs 365.24 crore on 6.94% fall in total income to Rs 3618.92 crore in Q1 June 2016 over Q1 June 2015. The result was announced after market hours on Friday, 12 August 2016. Earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) fell 42% to Rs 611 crore in Q1 June 2016 over Q1 June 2015. EBITDA margin dropped to 17% in Q1 June 2016 from 27.5% in Q1 June 2015. Cipla said that the growth momentum in key markets - India, South Africa and the US with focused cost containment measures has resulted in enhanced profitability in the base business. The recent acquisitions of InvaGen Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Exelan Pharmaceuticals Inc. are EBITDA margin-accretive at a consolidated level with the integration plans progressing smoothly. The company is preparing itself for the future with focused investments in R&D as well as portfolio build-up through strategic inorganic moves. The quarter also saw an improvement in cash flows on account of operational efficiencies, Cipla said. Cipla also announced resignation of Subhanu Saxena from the post of Managing Director & Global Chief Executive Officer with effect from the close of business hours on 31 August 2016. The company has appointed Umang Vohra as the Managing Director & Global Chief Executive Officer of the company effective 1 September 2016. Vohra joined the company in October 2015 as the Global Chief Financial & Strategy Officer and was elevated as the Global Chief Operating Officer early this year as part of a planned progression. L&T gained 0.66% after the company won a contract from the Maharashtra state government to convert Nagpur into an integrated smart city. The scope of work in phase 1 of the Nagpur smart city project will cover laying of 1,200 kilometers of optical fiber network backbone, creating 136 city wifi hotspots at key locations, establishing 100 digital interactive kiosks and developing city surveillance systems with 3,800 IP based cameras. Further, the city has identified a strip of approximately 6 kilometers from Japanese Garden Square to Orange City Hospital Square to be developed as a 'Smart Strip' with state-of-the-art systems powered by smart ICT interventions like smart transport, solid waste management. smart lighting, etc. which can be leveraged in a phased manner to ultimately cover the entire city. The Nagpur smart city project will be executed by L&T's Smart World & Communications business vertical. On the macro front, inflation based on the consumer price index (CPI) accelerated 6.07% in July 2016 from 5.77% in June 2016. The core CPI inflation moved up to 4.52% in July 2016 from 4.39% in June 2016. The data was released after market hours on Friday, 12 August 2016. Another data showed that industrial production (IIP) expanded 2.1% in June 2016 from a year earlier. The rise was primarily led by expansion in electricity and mining production. The data was released after market hours on Friday, 12 August 2016.

He also noted that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's lead in the polls over her GOP counterpart, Donald Trump, may be a contributing factor to the recent rally. "Not to make a statement on which candidate is better, but usually markets prefer for the incumbent party to retain the White House." The three indexes also posted new intraday highs, as benchmark S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite broke above previous intraday highs of 2,188.45 and 5,238.54, respectively, shortly after the open.  The Dow Jones industrial average also posted a record high, rising past its previous high of 18,638.34. These previous records were all set last week, despite the indexes posting just slight weekly gains. "It's a major vacation time between now and Labor day," said Ernie Cecilia, CIO at Bryn Mawr Trust. "The market right now is floating up on not a lot of news." "There's a lack of alternatives into other instruments," he said, noting that trading volume has been low recently. The S&P gained 0.28 percent, with materials leading. Twenty-nine S&P components hit new 52-week highs, including Sysco — which reported quarterly results before the bell, Ross Stores and Procter & Gamble. "The market is being driven by the same theme," said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird, referring to low interest rates around the world and the "hunt for yield." "Until we get some optimism, the path of least resistance is higher. Nobody likes this market." The Dow rose 59 points, with Boeing and Goldman Sachs contributing the most gains. The Nasdaq added 0.56 percent. "The market should continue to go higher on the no-alternative factor," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial. "The market is feeding on itself." "In order to get a big move down, ... you need to see some news the market perceives as bad," said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. "We don't have that right now." Despite posting several milestones last week, stocks traded in a relatively narrow range. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near multi-year lows last week. On Monday, it traded about 1.5 percent higher, around 11.75. Investors, meanwhile, were watching oil prices as U.S. crude settled 2.81 percent higher at $45.74 a barrel in choppy trade. On Monday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak bolstered hopes that oil producing nations could take action to stabilize prices, telling a Saudi newspaper that his country was consulting with Saudi Arabia and other producers to achieve market stability. "Good luck with that, if investors believe this. The move which we are seeing in the market is the real example how speculations can drive the price action. If you look at the demand equation, we had GDP data from the third biggest economy in the world and it is not something which is praising the demand for oil," said Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets. On the data front, the Empire State Manufacturing survey index fell five points to -4.2. "The lack of even a whiff of volatility, however, prevents me from shifting my outlook from neutral to something more far more negative. The intraday range for the blue chip index has consistently fallen to 0.25-0.50% of the underlying index level. When this statistic falls into this tight band, the blue chips have secured a positive daily return 67.7% of the time since October 2001 compared to 54.5% for all sessions over the same period," Jeremy Klein, chief market strategist at FBN Securities, said in a Monday note to clients. Other data released Monday included the NAHB housing index, which showed homebuilder sentiment rose 2 points. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) rose about 1 percent, led higher by Toll Brothers, which was up about 3 percent. Investors will also await for the Fed to release the minutes from its July meeting, although Schwab's Frederick said that he doesn't expect any big surprises from them. On the earnings front, several firms, including Home Depot, Lowe's and Cisco Systems, are scheduled to report results this week. "Through Friday's close, 459 companies, or 92%, of S&P 500 have reported 2Q 2016 results," said Nick Raich, CEO at The Earnings Scout, in a Monday note. "While 71% of those companies are exceeding their 2Q 2016 EPS estimates, 60% have had their 3Q 2016 EPS estimate go lower, on average by -1.79%, after releasing results." Last week, retail giant Macy's posted better-than-expected results. U.S. Treasurys fell on Monday, with the two-year note yield holding near 0.72 percent and the benchmark 10-year yields trading at 1.55 percent. The dollar traded lower against a basket of currencies, with the euro near $1.119 and the yen around 101.2. The pound also hit a one-month low against the greenback. Overseas, European stocks traded mostly flat. Asian equities traded mixed, as Japan's Nikkei 225 fell after its GDP data disappointed, while China's Shanghai composite rose more than 2 percent on stimulus hopes. About two stocks advanced for every decliner at the New York Stock Exchange, with an exchange volume of 422 million and a composite volume of 2.096 billion. Gold futures for December delivery settled $4.30 to $1,347.50 per ounce.

Warc's Lucy Aitken interviewed him earlier this month. What is your take on the role of comms planning versus creative planning? Where you talk to people and how you engage with them is becoming more important because increasingly, people can opt out of advertising completely. If you subscribe to Netflix or use an ad blocker, for instance, you can avoid a lot of advertising. So now you start with where to put the messaging and that's now defining the canvas the message goes into. People's paid media is decreasing – they don't have the budgets to achieve cut-through on TV anymore - so they have to do something else.  For instance, we want to reach gamers because the graphics on the Samsung Galaxy S7 are really good. But we're finding that gamers tend to have ad blockers so we're looking at in-stream advertising because they can't block that. Then you have to look at how you work around those things and add value.    What has been the most useful new platform to emerge in the past five years? Facebook. Social is overtaking search and Facebook has moved into messaging and live video. It just edges past Google, but between them, Google and Facebook take 65% of all adspend now.   What criteria do you use to assess an emerging platform? In terms of the latest tech, we have a relationship with start-ups where we've worked really hard to sort out contracts and processes. We've had lots of success in getting projects off the ground with the likes of P&G and Samsung. When we look at start-ups, the areas we're seeing most people cluster around are mobile, social and market research and, broadly, the partners we're bringing in are in those areas. User-generated content is another area where we're able to plug into existing clients to help them adapt and move into emerging areas. Innovation at scale is about working with partners to move from a £10k test to a multi-market spend. We introduced Snapchat filters for Samsung Galaxy S7 and scaled it across 23 markets. It's about how you scale. Rather than 'test and learn' which always feels a bit passive, you've got to go big and go big quickly! If something has worked, it's about how you can rapidly push it across markets.   Spotify and Clear Channel claim that 100% of their inventory will be automated within five years. Will this also be the case for your business? The long tail, yes. But there will always be a need for deep meaning that resonates with people. There's one way of looking at a customer journey or a customer experience where you look at each step and how you make it better. The other way is to look at the highs and lows of that experience – so what do you remember a week later after that experience? If you're shopping, a good interaction at a cash desk in terms of a rational reading would never come through because check-out took 53% longer than a benchmark. Yet the customer had a nice conversation with cashier. That's the danger of too much automation - we're not robots.   What will future media agencies look like? How do they need to adapt? They need to be more fluid and flexible and that takes a hell of a lot of thinking about how you bake in agility to massive organisations. It comes back to clients, the questions they have and how you address them. You can see media agencies splitting into one part that's about automated buying - the heavily data-driven direct response model of agencies – and another part that's about understanding people rather than thinking that everything can be run off algorithms.   How does 'moment marketing' change the nature of comms planning? Context has always been central to media. What we have now is more data to understand those moments. We could disappear into a world of hyper-personalisation and hyper-granularity without creating those big moments that bring people together. Marc Pritchard at P&G has talked about moving away from so much targeting and personalisation because they don't need it. There's a great thing with Coke where they found that sales went up when it snowed heavily because schools shut early and the kids were allowed out to play. They all went to a store and bought Coke. That makes snow days a big enough 'moment' on the happiness platform. Can you cite an example of how data helped you uncover a surprising insight that informed future comms planning? We found out from a client that there was a massive spike every year in cold and flu medicine when people get a cold. Yet unless they have a cold, they don't think about cold medicine. We used to advertise in December, but by that time they could have missed the season by a month. We looked at social data and at Twitter, and we could see that British people like to have a whinge about having flu. So we created these comedic videos to cheer them up in response to that. We would never have got there without seeing those data patterns.   Warc's Media Awards recognise comms planning which has made a significant impact on business results.

Most Popular The Lowdown is Ad Age's weekly look at news nuggets from across the world of marketing, including trends, campaign tidbits, executive comings and goings and more. Zumbida Credit: MillerCoors MillerCoors is poised to release an alcoholic version of aguas frescas, a traditional Mexican drink made with fruit, water and sugar. The brand is called Zumbida, according to a filing the brewer made with the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. The label, which is in Spanish, shows a mango flavor with the words "aguas frescas" at top. "Zumbida is a traditional drink done in a distinctly American way -- a fusion," said a MillerCoors spokesman, confirming the launch. The drink has 4.2% alcohol by volume, putting it on par with the average light beer. The label includes the words "con un toque de piquete" which means "with a touch of alcohol." Hispanics are a key audience for beer marketers and are helping drive growth for Mexican imported brands such as Corona Extra and Modelo Especial from Constellation Brands. AB InBev has sought to tap into the growth by importing to the U.S. brands it owns in Mexico, such as Montejo and Estrella Jalisco. MillerCoors does not have a Mexican beer in its portfolio. While Zumbida will be made in the U.S., not Mexico, MillerCoors seems to be aiming to gain credibility with Hispanics by referencing aqua frescas. Coca-Cola Co. and Pepsi Co. soft drinks are displayed for sale inside a Shell Gas Station in Louisville, Kentucky. Credit: Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg Here's more depressing news for the soda category: Coke, Pepsi, Sprite and Fanta all have lost brand value this year, according to a new report from Brand Finance, a business valuation and strategic consultancy. Coca-Cola held onto the top spot of the organization's ranking of 25 beverage brands, but Coke's brand value fell by 5% to $34.2 billion, according to the report. Brand Finance calculates brand value by estimating the likely future sales of a brand and calculating a "royalty rate" that represents "what the owner would have to pay for use of the brand -- assuming it were not already owned," according to a description in a press release. Pepsi's value plummeted 11%, while Coke-owned Sprite fell 5% and Coke-owned Fanta slipped by 1%. Gainers included PepsiCo's Mountain Dew, which jumped 6%. "While consumers may steer clear of carbonated drinks, Mountain Dew has evidently managed to project itself as a worthy purchase despite being carbonated. This is largely due to the fact that the brand has embraced the idea of being an energy drink, thus making the drink appealing to those who want an energy boost," Brand Finance stated. 25 Most Valuable Non-alcoholic Beverage Brands (USDm) Rank 2016 Rank 2015 Brand Brand Value 2016 Brand Value 2015 Brand Value Change 1 1 Coca-Cola 34,180 35,797 -5% 2 2 Pepsi 18,947 21,379 -11% 3 3 Red Bull 6,538 7,389 -12% 4 4 Nescafé 6,169 5,216 18% 5 New Lipton 4,147 3,496 19% 6 6 Gatorade 4,070 3,911 4% 7 5 Sprite 3,762 3,973 -5% 8 7 Fanta 3,318 3,350 -1% 9 10 Mountain Dew 2,739 2,577 6% 10 8 Tropicana 2,613 3,069 -15% 11 New Monster 2,544 2,399 6% 12 New 7-Up 2,328 2,481 -6% 13 New Twinings 2,143 N/A N/A 14 New Folgers 2,012 1,513 33% 15 New Dr Pepper 1,995 2,116 -6% 16 New Yakult 1,882 N/A N/A 17 New Ciel 1,282 N/A N/A 18 New Evian 1,226 N/A N/A 19 New Minute Maid 1,204 N/A N/A 20 New Kagome 1,167 N/A N/A 21 New Ovaltine 1,121 N/A N/A 22 New Mirinda 1,017 N/A N/A 23 New Aquafina 964 1,025 -6% 24 New Nestea 938 N/A N/A 25 New Dasani 933 N/A N/A Source: Brand Finance You can't go wrong with kids and dogs in ads. Moen has worked both into its new campaign from Havas Chicago, which won the account in December. The campaign keeps Moen's 23-year-old tagline "Buy it for looks. Buy it for life." But it focuses more on the life part, with a sentimental father-son bath-time spot breaking earlier this week and a second spot to come later featuring a dog who won't leave her owner alone in the shower (outfitted with a flexible Moen shower head that has a magnetic anchor). The new campaign is launching across TV, print, online video, online radio and social networks. 'MasterChef Junior' season four winner Addison Osta Smith for Velveeta Velveeta Mini Blocks Credit: Jason Kempin/Getty Images for Velveeta courtesy Olson Engage for Kraft Heinz Velveeta is downsizing. The Kraft Heinz brand known for big blocks of processed cheese now has a miniature version, Velveeta Mini Blocks. The new variety has five four-ounce wrapped blocks per package, so people can use a small amount and keep unused portions sealed. "MasterChef Junior" season four winner Addison Osta Smith served as chef on Aug. 16 to promote the product. She served complimentary Cheesy Bacon Risotto, Cheesy Pulled Pork Taquitos and Cheesy Potato Waffles at New York's Blank Slate Coffee & Kitchen, which was renamed Melt for the occasion. "People know me from MasterChef Junior for my fancy desserts and miso-glazed cod, but when I'm at home with my family, we like to keep it fun and easy," Ms. Smith said in a statement, which described her as an "award-winning chef and playtime and sports enthusiast." Olson Engage worked with Velveeta on the launch. Coty is doubling down on Katy Perry, who represents the CoverGirl brand the company will acquire in its soon-to-close deal with Procter & Gamble Co., and who is also launching the Mad Love fragrance brand with a novel campaign on the Kik messaging service. Katy Perry Mad Love Women's Perfume Credit: Coty via Kohl's The campaign by chat app marketing agency Block Party lets users exchange points they earn on Kik (by doing such things as watching videos or downloading sticker packs) for Ms. Perry's Mad Love eau de parfum. This is the first time that consumers can redeem rewards program points for a physical product in a U.S. chat app, according to Coty and Block Party. "It's a way for the brand to maximize engagement and reward young consumers for spreading awareness," said Kristin Spinn, Coty senior director-global marketing, in a statement. "Buy one, give one" is a concept best associated with Toms shoes or Warby Parker glasses. But former USAID consultant David Simnick has been at it as long as those brands since co-founding Soapbox in 2010. Now Soapbox seems to be finding its moment with a new social media campaign from Mekanism that has racked up more than a million views its first week and growing distribution, including an upcoming nationwide rollout in Walmart stores. The "One Hand Washes the Other" concept introduces privileged American kids on a playground to the idea that other kids don't necessarily have soap readily available, and that their purchases (or their parents') can change that. Soapbox gives about half its donated products in the U.S., the other half in developing markets, where it works with local manufacturers to keep its donations from wiping out local industry. MLB Wendy's email promo Credit: MLB.com Partners Wendy's, home of a 4 for $4 meal deal for months, now has an even less expensive option -- a 50-cent limited-time price on a small Frosty. Wendy's is also giving frugal Frosty fans a free subscription to the MLB.TV Premium streaming service for the rest of the Major League Baseball season if they post a selfie on their public Twitter or Instagram accounts with a Frosty and the hashtag #50centFrostyMLB. Some fans, of course, decided to have fun with the offer, posting references to rapper 50 Cent's poor pitch from 2014. Wendy's is promoting the deal on Twitter and elsewhere. Plus, baseball fans heard about the offer through an MLB.com partners' email. 50 Cent & #MLB shouldn't even be in the same sentence…#50CentFrostyMLB pic.twitter.com/PDCHc8sefO — Ⓐustiη♠️Ⓦəstmoore (@Mr_Westmoore) August 15, 2016 We're still in the muggy throes of summer but brands are already thinking about Halloween. Retailers including Rite Aid began pushing the holiday with in-store displays weeks ago. Since it's the 50th anniversary of "It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown!" -- yes, Linus has spent half a century waiting in vain for a squash -- Peanuts will collaborate with 98 farms across the country, and cornfield maze design firm the Maize, to promote the brand. Special events for the Iconix Brand Group-owned brand will include mazes with Peanuts characters and special TV screenings. Like in 2008, Iconix will also partner with Rock the Vote and celebrities including John Oliver and Whoopi Goldberg to encourage voter registration for the upcoming election. Liquor marketer Beam Suntory has inked a sponsorship deal with the Major League Soccer franchise LA Galaxy. The pact includes sponsorship of the team and the StubHub Center, the multi-use stadium in Carson, Calif., where the team plays. Beam is opening the Hornitos Tequila Cantina in the stadium, which is named for one of its tequila brands, as well as the Jim Beam Bourbon Champions Lounge, which is described as a 2,200 square-foot recently renovated premium-seating area, according to a statement. In other stadium news, the Miami Dolphins today are expected to announce that its home stadium will be renamed Hard Rock Stadium as part of a deal with Hard Rock International, the Orlando-based operator of restaurants, hotels and casinos, according to the Miami Herald. As the Herald noted, the stadium has had multiple naming rights partners in recent years. It was most recently called Sun Life Stadium, after the financial services company. Contributing: E.J.

Feinstein, Collins would give FDA more authority over cosmetics than it has over food. Eric Boehm|Aug. 17, 2016 3:40 pm Peter Bolter/Western Mail and Echo Copyright/NewscomAfter a bad batch of shampoo made some customers hair fall out, the New York Times ran a front page story on Tuesday asking whether Congress should give the Food and Drug Administration more regulatory authority over hair and skin products. The entire piece is an exercise in "do-somethingism," since there are already better ways for the market—and yes, even the government—to deal with the problems created by Wen Hair Care, the shampoo product at the center of a $26 million class action lawsuit. It appears that the article was prompted by ongoing congressional efforts to apply more regulations to the cosmetics industry and give the FDA authority to issue recalls of skin and hair products. More on that in a moment. First, the facts. The piece starts off wanting you to know that Los Angeles hairstylist Chaz Dean made "millions" by selling a variety of scented hair care products. Those same products ended up prompting more than 21,000 complaints from consumers who experienced unwanted itching, rashes and even widespread hair loss after using Dean's Wen Hair Care products. Without even pausing to consider whether those people have another sort of recourse besides an expensive expansion of federal regulatory power (spoiler alert: they do), the Times turns to U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, who are pitching new legislation to require the FDA to do additional testing of cosmetic products and give the FDA authority to issue mandatory recalls for "products found to be unsafe." There's good reason to feel sympathy for the victims here—no one expects to end up temporarily bald because they purchased a bottle of supposedly "revolutionary" shampoo and they are right to be upset about it—but the lack of federal regulations on cosmetics didn't cause this problem and isn't the best way to fix it. Let's start by looking at what happened to those "millions" that Chaz Dean made by apparently swindling unsuspecting consumers. A class action lawsuit against Wen Hair Care and its manufacturer, Guthy-Renker LLC, resulted in a $26 million settlement for the plaintiffs. The settlement awards $25 to any person who bought a bottle of Wen and up to $20,000 to anyone who experienced bodily harm or hair loss after using the product. That's how the government should be involved in a situation like this: in a judiciary role to work out a settlement between the aggrieved parties and the business responsible for misleading them. The system works! The Times article suggests this application of government is not enough; that the federal authorities must be more active to prevent this sort of thing from happening at all or at least to respond more quickly when it does. The FDA must be able to force companies to recall potentially problematic products, Feinstein and Collins argue. When trying to decide whether the government should have the authority to force businesses to recall products, it's important to know how recalls work. In almost all cases, recalls are voluntary actions taken by manufacturers. That's true whether we're talking about cosmetic products regulated by the FDA or whether you're looking how the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration oversees recalls of defective automotive parts. Even when comes to issues of food safety—certainly an area where there is a greater potential threat to public health and safety than what is created by bad shampoo—the FDA can only request a recall. The final decision rests with the food supplier, and oftentimes businesses will initiate their own recalls without being asked by the FDA because it's generally accepted that lying to your customers or making them sick isn't good for business. The same is true here. Good cosmetic businesses will issue recalls of faulty products as a way to maintain consumer trust (and to avoid the kinds of class action lawsuits like the one brought against Wen in this instance). Businesses that provide bad products and then don't come clean about the problems—no matter what industry they are a part of—won't stay in business for long. At the risk of sounding facetious: shampoo that causes baldness is already pretty bad for business, even before the $25 million lawsuits start rolling in. To recap: the people who were negatively affected by Wen Hair Care were compensated for their losses and the FDA has the same authority over recalls for cosmetic products as it does over recalls related to food safety or anything else. What more could you want the government to do in this situation? Feinstein and Collins want to pile more regulations onto the cosmetic industry. In addition to letting the FDA issue mandatory recalls, their bill would require the FDA to test all cosmetic products that contain at least one of five common ingredients. That's going to cost an estimated $20 billion annually, with the funds being extracted from the cosmetic industry in the form of new "fees." This legislation is important, we're told by U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone Jr., D-New Jersey, because "there is effectively no regulation of cosmetics." Except there is. The FDA's website explains that it "monitors the safety of cosmetic products that are being marketed and acts on products that are established to be harmful to consumers when used as intended." It does that by conducting inspections of manufacturing facilities and by surveying products on the market "especially if aware of a potential problem." That information is used to alert consumers, support regulatory actions or issue guidance for industry, the FDA says. The Times touts the fact that the bill has "won the endorsement of heavyweights" in the cosmetic industry, including Clinique, Johnson & Johnson, MAC and Procter and Gamble. Opposition comes from the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors, a trade group that represents portions of the industry generally not large enough to be household names and not wealthy enough to hire their own lobbyists. This is the same story that often plays out when government tries to increase regulations. Larger companies—like those "heavyweights" of the industry rattled off by the Times—are better able to absorb the added cost of regulations and will support the expansion of regulations as a way to hurt smaller competitors. This is the same dynamic driving the FDA's expensive, destrutive and unnecessary regulations of electronic cigarettes, by the way. In a statement to Reason, the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors said it did not support the Feinstein-Collins bill because "it placed too large a burden on small business, did not provide reasonable national uniformity, and would, if passed, stifle innovation in the cosmetics and personal care industry." There's no way to know whether more testing and regulations would have caught the problems with Wen Hair Care shampoo before it hit store shelves, but the people injured have been compensated and the company paid the price for making a bad product. One business' mistake should not be a reason to add to the regulatory burden faced by all others in the same field. Eric Boehm is a reporter at Reason.com.

At this confession, her four teammates dissolved into giggles of agreement. “Um, in the back, I thought I was gonna die,” Simone Biles admitted. “Yes!” Raisman replied. “In the bathroom, when me and you were in the bathroom, I asked you, ‘Are you okay?’” Raisman paused. “And I was like, ‘Me neither.’” At that point the gathered women began sharing their nerves-before-competition stories, talking over each other with giddy mentions of the shaking hands and near-vom experiences that came when they finally—finally—found themselves on the Olympic stage. “We just sat there,” Biles said, recalling those tense pre-competition moments, “and we were like”—and then the three-time all-around world champion, the woman an NBC commentator referred to earlier in the evening as “the greatest of all time,” made a dramatic shruggie gesture. In response to which: Her team giggled some more. Related Story The Weird Athleticism of the Victoria's Secret Model NBC’s roving cameras caught that off-stage exchange—superhumans, acting in a decidedly human fashion—after the five women had clinched the U.S.’s spot to compete for team gold in Rio. But the athletes (also known as “Team USA,” the “Fierce Five: Redux,” and “The Most Dominant U.S. Gymnastics Team Ever Assembled”) didn’t merely secure the team’s place in the finals, and they didn’t merely come away with a first-place ranking heading into the competition that will determine who wins medals. Instead, they smashed through the high expectations set for them. And yet here they were, after their big, if unsurprising, victory, commiserating and confessing and laughing and acting, in the end, like exactly what they are: a group of young—very young—women. Women’s gymnastics is traditionally one of the most-watched events of the summer Games—much more popular than its masculine counterpart, which features similar feats of super-human strength and skill. (The rings! THE RINGS.) That’s in part because women’s gymnastics is, as entertainment, riveting—the balance beam alone is basically a 4-inch-thick hunk of Hitchcock—but it is also, likely, because the sport presents collisions of a more cultural strain. Here are young women, bedecked of bow and bedazzled of leotard, flexing and flipping and generally giving a massive side-eye to gravity itself. Here are the performance of sport and the performance of femininity, united in a singular, if extremely precarious, harmony. The team’s leos will feature nearly 5,000 crystals in designs that evoke shooting stars and swirling clouds. In that sense, women’s gymnastics captivates because it insinuates: The sport serves, on top of everything else, as a metaphor for a cultural moment that is appending notions of strength (and not just “moral strength”) to womanhood. It exemplifies the tensions of a time that is newly distinguishing between the female and the feminine. It’s a sport, too, with an undeniably political edge: Women’s gymnastics, like this particular moment in feminism, pays lip service to ideals of “empowerment,” but its workings are underscored by the knowledge that years’ worth of effort can, through gravity’s apathy, be undone in a single instant. Sweaty and sparkly, muscular and girly, explosive and controlled: Gymnastics is the successful execution of many different balancing acts. * * * Women’s gymnastics, in its current form, owes a lot both to second-wave feminism and to Title IX—which brought about the general de-dainty-ization of the traditionally balletic sport. (“Before the 1970s,” the essayist Meghan O’Rourke points out, “women’s gymnastics had been snoozy and staid, resembling, as a Sports Illustrated writer put it, ‘a lyrical exercise somewhere this side of ballet.’”) A recent change in the sport’s scoring system, which took away the long-standing cap of 10, allowed for ever-upward difficulty levels in routines, which in turn further emphasized feat-affording strength among its athletes. It may have preserved its official name—“artistic gymnastics”—amid all these changes, but the sport’s champions ascend by embracing moves that are traditionally not “ladylike”: leaping, grasping, thudding, punching the air after a stuck landing. Gymnastics is determinedly unladylike in another way, too: It is for the most part practiced, at the elite levels, only by very young women (the current U.S. team ranges in age from 16 to 22). This is emphasized in an aesthetic that borrows heavily from what you might call “pageant chic.” Team USA is known, in particular, for its bedazzled competition uniforms, and each Olympics has brought with it leotards that are more crystal-encrusted—with Swarovski versions, as “they have the most shine and sparkle”—than the last. (Given how much of a “typical” adolescence elite gymnasts are made to sacrifice in their athletic pursuits, it’s at this point a cliche of the sport to talk about their sparkling competition leotards as their “prom dresses.”) This year, The New York Times reports, the women’s leos will feature nearly 5,000 individual crystals—in designs that evoke shooting stars and swirling clouds and the other stuff of dreams fulfilled. Stories from the games in Rio Read more Dramatic makeup, too, is a mainstay of the gymnastics floor—Biles, last night, wore sparkling eyeliner that mimicked the swooping lines of the team leo—as are manicured fingers and pedicured toes. (This is perhaps because USA Gymnastics stipulates, without a bit of irony, that each athlete competing under its auspices must be “well groomed in her appearance.”) On Sunday, NBC’s omniscient camera caught Madison Kocian, the 19-year-old whose specialty is the uneven bars, kneeling on the floor after having executed a nearly perfect routine. She was zipping her chalk-covered grips into a hot-pink makeup bag. It’s not only gymnasts, of course, who embrace their femininity on the field of play. Hair ribbons are a mainstay of women’s softball. Brandi Chastain celebrated her scoring of the U.S. women’s soccer team’s game-winning penalty shot against China by taking off her shirt to reveal her sports bra. Flo-Jo was known for her elaborate manicures, and in her spirit, this time around, come—among others—the French basketball player Emmeline Ndongue, who wears patriotic stripes on her nails, and the American volleyball player Destinee Hooker, whose manicure sports the union flag and the Olympic rings. Procter & Gamble went so far as to set up a nail salon in the Olympic village so that athletes—presumably women—might similarly bedazzle themselves. Women’s gymnastics, though, is notable for something beyond its athletes’ embrace of their femininity: its simultaneous embarrassment about their femaleness. Women gymnasts have come to resemble swimmers in their uniform lack of body hair—waxing being an unspoken mandate that has as much to do with aesthetics as with aerodynamics. (Well groomed in her appearance.) The gymnasts’ outfits, too, their snazzy sparkles notwithstanding, suggest a certain abashedness about the female form: Judges are free to deduct points for underwear that peeks out from beyond the athletes’ leos. It’s a sartorial awkwardness that reflects a more systemic one. In gymnastics, the body fat that is a typical signal of healthy womanhood is stubbornly burned off. The development of breasts has curtailed otherwise promising careers. The rigors of training—coupled with eating disorders that have been known to afflict its athletes—can delay menstruation. Women’s gymnastics, on the whole, may celebrate its eponymous “women”; it is also, however, decidedly ambivalent about them. Many of its workings suggest a preference to see those women, whatever their age and achievement, as girls. USA Gymnastics stipulates, without a hint of irony, that each athlete must be “well groomed in her appearance.” And then, of course, there are allegations of sexual abuse that have long cast a shadow over the sport. Joan Ryan’s 1995 book, Little Girls in Pretty Boxes, told stories not just of bullying young athletes have endured at the hands of their coaches, but of abuse. USA Gymnastics banned Don Peters, the coach of the 1984 Olympic team, from the sport after several of the athletes he’d trained made accusations against him—but it didn’t do so until 2011. Last week, the IndyStar released the results of a lengthy investigation into the matter, concluding that USAG has “turned a blind eye to sex abuse.” The tension, across the sport’s elite levels—a dynamic of fragility and strength, of empowerment and its opposite—has escalated to such a degree that some critics have wondered whether watching women’s gymnastics is, at this point, unethical. One of those wonderings, however, accompanied its text—ironically, or perhaps fittingly, and either way revealingly—with artistic photographs of Olympian and other elite gymnasts that emphasized not just the athletes’ muscles, but also their manicures and hairdos and, in a couple of cases, their crotches. * * * In that, gymnastics is an extreme reflection of a widespread cultural ambivalence—about youth in general, perhaps, but about girlhood in particular. On the one hand, “empowerment” is the ethic of the moment, via toys and clothes and media messaging that seek to downplay gender as a factor in a young person’s life. NBC, on Sunday, featured a bio package with Gabby Douglas, one of the stars who emerged from the London Games (and the other gymnast—with Raisman—who is representing the U.S., in 2016, for her second Olympics). Douglas, in an interview, cited Serena Williams as one of her role models, and her explanation reflected the feminist messaging of the moment. “She’s just so dominant,” the star gymnast said of the tennis star, “and she just goes after what she wants, and she’s just so aggressive. I love strong, empowered women.” Gymnastics, even more than other sports, emphasizes the challenges gravity-bound women must navigate. In the same series of Better Know an Athlete packages, though, NBC emphasized, for Simone Biles, not her dominance or her aggression, but instead her … girly femininity. Biles’s short documentary featured footage of the young athlete grinning at the camera while getting a manicure (and requesting that her nails be done in patriotic red and blue). The young champion, Bob Costas intoned, “in any other context might seem like any other teenager”—and his thesis was proven, again and again. “She loves girly stuff,” Biles’s mother shared in an interview for the package, “so she loves to shop and she loves to get her hair done, her nails done. She likes to feel pretty.” Her father, in a separate interview, agreed: “She’s a teenager. A typical female teenager.” These mini-movies will always, across sports and across Games, engage in a kind of doubling: Their point is to emphasize the ordinariness of athletes who have chosen lives that are, by definition, anything but ordinary—and to make those athletes relatable, as such, to their couch-sitting audiences. They will always revel in the banality of greatness, and vice versa. But what Sunday’s treatments of the U.S. Olympic team did was to suggest another kind of paradox, and another kind of relatability—one that has as much to do with the athletes’ gender as with their athleticism. This may be the age of women’s empowerment, the age of Serena Williams and Gabby Douglas and Simone Biles and Hillary Clinton; it is also, though, the age of Donald Trump and the wage gap and the tampon tax and the Bic for Her Fashion Retractable Ball Pen, manufactured in a lady-friendly pink. It is also the age that found the Chicago Tribune, on Sunday, announcing the fact that Corey Cogdell-Unrein had medaled for the U.S. in trap-shooting with the tweet, “Wife of a Bears’ lineman wins a bronze medal today in Rio Olympics.” So the political message of women’s gymnastics is on the one hand what the political message of any women’s sports will eventually be: It separates achievement, casually but also meaningfully, from aesthetics. Sports don’t care what a woman looks like, or whether she’s graceful, or whether she’s pleasing to anyone. They care only how high she jumped, how quickly she ran, how many goals she scored. And yet gymnastics comes with particular caveats about looks and behavior and “grace.” It carries standards, both stipulated and unspoken, about one’s comportment. It enforces, for all the strength it demands of its athletes, a certain daintiness. Its competitors, the sport seems to believe—no matter what else they achieve—had better look good while doing their achieving. In that sense gymnastics is, for better or for worse, much more in line than other sports are with the challenges that gravity-bound women face every day. An Under Armour ad that went viral in the lead-up to the Rio Games showed Madison Kocian training, with other women gymnasts, for her Olympics debut. The ad featured inspiring music. It featured the brand’s tagline of of-the-moment empowerment: “Rule yourself.” It featured scenes of the gymnast who is currently one of the best in the world sacrificing, striving, hurting, pushing … and getting her nails done.

President-Elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he will nominate the Michigan philanthropist and prominent Republican donor Betsy DeVos to be U.S. Education Secretary. The announcement signals that big changes could be on the way for schools and students around the country. Here are five things to know: 1. DeVos will push for school choice DeVos has been a vocal supporter of school choice, which is something Trump backed on the campaign trail. DeVos, who heads up the pro-charter and pro-school-voucher nonprofit American Federation for Children, has said parents should have the ability to choose the best schools for their children, whether they are traditional public schools, charters, or private schools. Trump has proposed creating a $20 billion federal voucher program for families to use to send their kids to the school of their choice. But, as Education Week noted recently, making that program a reality could be difficult. It’s unclear exactly where the funding would come from, and even if Congress did manage to pass such a proposal, some states currently prohibit funds from going to schools with religious affiliations, which could complicate how those funds are used. Continue Reading Daniel Lombroso / The Atlantic 'Hail Trump!': White Nationalists Salute the President Elect Daniel Lombroso and Yoni Appelbaum Video of an alt-right conference in Washington, D.C., where Trump’s victory was met with cheers and Nazi salutes. “Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory!” That’s how Richard B. Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press. Continue Reading Carolyn Kaster / AP The Trump Takeover The Editors After a shocking upset, the president-elect and his party prepare for next year.

Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice. Continue Reading Frederick Carl Frieseke / Wikimedia The Running Conversation in Your Head Julie Beck What a close study of "inner speech" reveals about why humans talk to themselves Language is the hallmark of humanity—it allows us to form deep relationships and complex societies. But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Etienne Fabre / SSAC A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave In France Ed Yong A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found. In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up). Continue Reading Carlo Allegri / Reuters Donald Trump's Conflicts of Interest: A Crib Sheet Jeremy Venook A semi-comprehensive list of the business concerns that may influence the president-elect as he prepares for the nation’s highest office Though several previous presidents have entered office with private fortunes to their names, none has done so with a business empire nearly as large or complicated as that of President-elect Donald J. Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out. Continue Reading sketchblog/flickr Masters of Love Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity. Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common? Continue Reading Chris Keane / Reuters What's Really Going On in North Carolina's Gubernatorial Race? David A. Graham Recounts, lawsuits, challenges—and the prospect of a legislative coup? Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000.

Sponsors are showering them with goody bags packed with free caps, trainers, t-shirts, leggings and even sports bras. The mad scramble by Olympic partners to have their products worn by athletes means that even if they don't win a medal, they will not go home empty handed. Nike's customised bags given to Brazilian and US athletes includes 40 items of training kit such as jumpers, leggings, trainers and even flip flops The US gymnastics team (from left to right: Madison Kocian, Laurie Hernandez, Simone Biles, Aly Raisman and Gabby Douglas) pose with special edition packs of Kellogg's cereal Partner McDonalds had a restaurant inside the Olympic village where athletes were pictured queuing to collect as much free junk food as they could eat. Team GB cyclist Callum Skinner posted a photo of Jason Kenny beneath the Golden Arches and joked he was buying him dinner the night before his record breaking performance in the velodrome.

Share this article Share Elsewhere, gymnast Simone Biles and her US teammates were posed up with special edition packs of Kellogg's cereal with their medals around their necks. Team GB's cycling heroes - led by Sir Bradley Wiggins - were given free sunglasses by Oakley which they wore to celebrate winning gold on Sunday night. Owain Doull, 23, posted a picture of him and his teammates and wrote: 'Big night last night at Chase & Status. Cheers Oakley for the baller Gold Sunnies.' This is the swag bag from Nike given to every athlete representing host nation Brazil  Callum Skinner tweeted this photo joking how he was feeding Kenny a 'nutritious meal' Sawan Serasinghe’s photo of his enormous order from McDonald's went viral Athletes order at the free McDonald's they have access to in the village where they live for the duration of the Games Members of the Czech squad head back to their accommodation with their free orders But when it comes to freebies, it looks like official sponsor Nike is doing most of the running. The sports giants customised bag given to every one of the 1,200 Team USA athletes and those from the host nation, Brazil, includes 40 items of training kit such as jumpers, leggings, trainers and even flip flops. They were also given drawstring bags, a water bottle, passport case and some weights. Men are given an extra watch, a pair of sunglasses and weights, while females receive extra workout clothes.  Namecheck: Sir Bradley Wiggins and cycling teammates were in a dark nightclub, but still wore their Oakley sunglassses Great Britain’s team sprint gold medalist Philip Hindes tweeted a picture of his huge meal Basketball star Paul George showcased how far-reaching that scope truly is by unveiling his personal Olympic swag bag. His personal bag included practice jerseys and shorts, a red, white and blue warm-up jacket, a grey hoodie and an American eagle-themed t-shirt.  Four years ago at London 2012, the 529 athletes representing USA all brought home gold – along with thousands of pounds' worth of other freebies. It was reported that every one of the US athletes in London were given gold rings worth £460 and a Swiss watch from Omega, the official timekeeper of the Games, worth several thousand pounds.  They also picked up five backpacks full of goodies.  The backpacks received contained 100 items, mostly from major sponsors such as Ralph Lauren, Nike, Oakley, and P&G. In total, nearly 100,000 free items were given out to American athletes. Freebies handed out by eager sponsors are worth considerably more than the gold medals the winners receive - which contain only one per cent gold. They are worth £430, according to Compound Interest. A silver medal is worth £240.  In Rio, around 30 per cent of the silver used is obtained from recycled sources – including X-ray plates, car parts and mirrors. A bronze medal is 95 per cent copper and five per cent zinc - worth just £180.

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE The economy, a young population, a more qualified labor force compared to surrounding countries, a strategic geographical location between the Middle East and Europe, ease of transportation, cultural affinities and exceptional business relations are just some of the reasons that Turkey has become a regional hub for international companies, resulting in an increasing number of international companies being managed from Turkey in recent years. According to information from the International Investors' Association (YASED), 33 percent of member companies use Turkey as a regional hub, along with dozens of multinational companies including Coca-Cola, Visa, General Electric (GE), British Petroleum (BP), Procter & Gamble (P&G) and the Walt Disney Company, managing their regional affairs from within Turkey. In addition to advantages in business management, multinational companies prefer Turkey for investments, production, exports and logistics, primarily choosing to manage dynamic markets in the Middle East, North Africa, Eastern Europe and Central Asia from their Turkish headquarters. Istanbul is regarded as the epicenter for these developments in the country. Speaking to Anadolu Agency, Chairman of YASED Ahmet Erdem said the aforementioned regions generate about 10 percent of the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP), adding that Turkey is a top preference among international companies as a hub in the region, which contributes to Turkey's goals to become an investment hub in the region, as well.

Contact welchgroup.com   Albert Einstein said, "Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world.  He who understands it, earns it...he who doesn't, pays it".  I agree with his statement but also believe most people don't really understand the magic of compounding.  About six months after starting my first post college graduation job, I started saving money from each paycheck with my bank.  Back then there weren't many investment options available so I started with a bank savings account.   At the time I conceptually understood the concept of compound interest but it was hard to 'internalize' the concept until I saw it actually happen in my savings account.  I invested $1,000 and earned 3% (yes, interest rates were higher back then) so one year later my account had $1,030.  The next year, instead of earning another $30, I earned $30 on the $1,000 plus I earned $0.90 on the $30 of interest from the year before.  It didn't seem like all that much at the time but as I also added money to the pot it began to grow surprisingly fast.  In fact, I used this savings plus borrowed some money from the bank to purchase my first piece of  real estate...a 4-plex apartment building and this simple act of saving 'consistently' helped launch my journey of wealth accumulation. The magic of compounding is simply earning money on your money and also earning money on the earnings on your money...over and over again.  Unfortunately, in 2008, our government began interfering in a significant way with interest rates.  While well intentioned, the effect has been to drive interest rates down to historical lows.  For example, historical rates for a 10-year treasury bond prior to 2008 was 4-5% while today the 10-year treasury is yielding a paltry 1.6%.  Compounding's Rich Uncle For most people, earnings at current interest rates, even with compounding, will not be enough to fund a retirement lifestyle anywhere near your current lifestyle.  An alternative approach is to blend compounding with the potential growth of the stock market.  This can be achieved with a basket of blue chip dividend-paying stocks.  As one example, look at Proctor & Gamble.  The current dividend yield is just over 3% annually.  More importantly, they have paid a dividend every year for over one-hundred years without missing.  They have also increased their dividend every year for the past 59 years.  Dividends also receive favorable tax treatment and are taxed at much lower rates than interest payments.  This is why I call companies like P&G 'Compounding's Rich Uncle'.  If you reinvest the dividend, you're getting the benefit of compounding and since they are raising their dividend payout every year, eventually their stock price also has to rise. Compounding's Evil Twin Compound interest is a two-sided coin.  On the one side are all the positive effects we discussed above.  The other side is what happens to you when you borrow money.  Let's assume there's a special offer to purchase an appliance for your home for $1,000 with no payments for three years and an interest rate of 21%.  Compound interest is now working against you in a big way.  In fact, when your payment comes due in five years, you'll owe over $1,800!  In our financial advisory practice, we see some version of this play out just about every week in the form of auto loans, credit card debt, store credit debt, and even home equity lines of credit and mortgages.  As managers of our family's finances, it's incumbent of each of us to understand how compounding works and manage it in a way that benefits us rather than enslaves us.   Business resources Read and post business press releases Sign up for free daily business news emails Most Read Active Discussions About Us About Alabama Media Group Jobs at Alabama Media Group Advertise with us News In Education Frequently Asked Questions About AL.com Contact Us Online Store Already a Subscriber?

In May, the client consolidated its digital and social media work with that unit, dropping R/GA and VaynerMedia from its roster in the process. “Every once in a while, you are lucky enough to get a team who not only does great work themselves, but gets great work out of everybody around them. That’s Susan and Daniela. We couldn’t be prouder and more excited about their promotion,” McCann New York co-chief creative officer Sean Bryan said in a statement. Young spent over three and a half years as a creative director with Saatchi & Saatchi, where she worked on the 2013 Tide “Miracle Stain” Super Bowl campaign before leaving for McCann. Prior to that she served as a copywriter with W+K New York for nearly three years, KBS+ for five years and Nitro for a little over a year. Vojta joined McCann following four years Saatchi & Saatchi New York, where she served as an integrated creative director for four years, working with clients including P&G and Tide North America. She also worked as an associate creative director at KBS, where her clients included Target, Coca-Cola, Citibank, Kao Brands, Wendy’s and the Ad Council, and a senior art director with Publicis New York on the L’Oréal, Club Med and Citizen Watches accounts. “It is always a pleasure to have team members recognized for their contributions,” said Kathleen Hall, Microsoft’s corporate vice president of global advertising and media. “In this case, doubly so, when we have two power women bringing such great commitment, insight and creativity to our business. And, to have them both excel while delivering a baby each in the last year makes it even more special. Nothing can stop these two.” The promotions follow on the heels of McCann New York bolstering its creative and account teams with the additions of executive account director Peter Bracegirdle and executive creative directors Shayne Millington and Craig Love earlier this month. They also follow the agency winning lead agency and brand strategy duties for Chick-fil-A. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

A report from Harbinger shows which ads have resonated most with women, as well as when they are tuning in to the games. By Val Maloney August 17, 2016 Women are more likely to tune into the opening and closing ceremonies during the Olympics, while men reported watching more of the finals during the Games. Those stats are part of an online survey done by Harbinger, which polled 1,514 Canadian Angus Reid panellists. The online survey was followed by a couch session on Aug. 10, which asked women aged 24 to 63 to view a series of nine Olympic-related ads appearing on Canadian TV, or available for online viewing in Canada. Of the ads, P&G’s “Thank You, Mom – Strong” was chosen as the most memorable, followed by Samsung’s “The Anthem” and Sport Chek’s “Olympic Manifesto.” “One constant we saw among all of the top ads is that they contain underlying themes that speak to women’s own values and experiences with messages that transcend the Olympics themselves,” Deborah Adams, SVP and managing director, Harbinger, stated in a release on the study. In addition to being more likely to watch the opening and closing ceremony, women (35%) were also more likely than men (28%) to report watching the medal ceremonies during the Olympics. To date 30.4 million Canadians have watched at least part of Olympics coverage on TV or online, according to numbers from CBC/Radio-Canada.

Energy companies rose with the price of oil, but stocks have been locked in an up-and-down pattern for more than a week. As the dollar weakened, the price of oil rose for the fourth day in a row to sustain a recent recovery and metals prices also rose. The Labor Department said inflation remains low, as prices paid by consumers were unchanged in July. Most stocks were down, but for the second day in a row, the biggest losses went to traditionally safe investments like telecom and utility companies. Bond prices also inched lower. The dollar has been very strong over the last few years compared to other currencies. Early this year it looked like the dollar would stay at those elevated levels because the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates while other global central banks were cutting them to stimulate their economies. John Cannally, chief economic strategist for LPL Financial, said the Fed has changed course. By leaving interest rates where they are, it has allowed the currency to weaken a bit, aiding U.S. manufacturing and energy companies and other exporters. “The Fed is using the dollar as sort of a tool of monetary policy,” he said. “The Fed wants to give China and emerging markets time to heal and get their houses in order.” The Dow Jones industrial average lost 84.03 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,552.02. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index slid 12 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,178.15. The Nasdaq composite fell 34.90 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,227.11. Stocks have been setting records recently, but it’s been more than a week since they rose for two days in a row. The market hasn’t made many big moves over the last month. The Labor Department said prices paid by consumers were unchanged in July as gas and other energy prices kept inflation down. Core inflation, which leaves out food and fuel prices, inched up just 0.1 percent for the month. Overall, inflation is up just 0.8 percent over the last year. That’s far below the 2-percent target set by the Federal Reserve, and investors concluded that means the Fed is less likely to raise interest rates soon. The dollar fell to 100.25 yen from 101.25 yen. The euro rose to $1.1277 from $1.1183. The weakening dollar boosted energy and metals prices Tuesday. Benchmark U.S. crude added 84 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $46.58 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark used to price international oils, rose 88 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $49.23 a barrel in London. Oil prices climbed last week after steep losses in June and July. That aided companies like pipeline operator Kinder Morgan, which rose 48 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $21.78. Apache Corp. added $1.09, or 2.2 percent, to $50.97. Metals prices also rose. Gold gained $9.40 to $1,456.90 an ounce. Silver added 3 cents to $19.87 an ounce. Copper edged up 2 cents to $2.17 a pound. Bond prices dipped and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.58 percent from 1.56 percent. Stocks have wavered lately as investors review mixed reports about the U.S. economy as they try to get a sense of its health. On Tuesday the Federal Reserve said U.S. factories cranked out more autos, machinery and chemicals in July, which suggests manufacturers might be recovering, though growth remains little changed from a year ago and manufacturers aren’t adding many jobs.

More than 200 women are involved in a class-action lawsuit with Chaz Dean Inc. and distributor Guthy-Renker over claims that Wen by Chaz Dean Cleansing Conditioner led to hair loss, hair breakage, rash, and balding. The New York Times reports that Guthy-Renker has agreed to a $26.25 million settlement but it’s not yet been approved by a federal judge. If approved, the settlement would repay $25 to anyone who’s purchased a bottle of the cleansing conditioner and up to $20,000 to people who experienced adverse reactions; they can make claims to be reimbursed for treating said reactions as well as for injury awards. Guthy-Renker stands by the product, citing studies that it believes demonstrates that the product does not cause hair loss, and instead characterized the pending settlement as a “business decision.” Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a safety alert for the cleansing conditioner but that’s about all it can do here — it doesn’t have the power to order recalls of cosmetics like it can with pharmaceuticals. Rather, the FDA monitors complaints submitted on its web site and decides whether to investigate. The agency could take action if it found that a product was mislabeled or contaminated. Proposed legislation from Senators Dianne Feinstein and Susan Collins would require cosmetic companies to notify the FDA of “serious adverse” reactions as they happen as well as submit an annual report of all “adverse events” and would give the FDA recall power. The bill would collect fees to study the safety of cosmetics ingredients and has been endorsed by major companies like Estée Lauder, Johnson & Johnson, and Procter & Gamble. Some independent companies like Mary Kay* support an alternative bill that would still require notification of injuries but would not collect money for safety evaluations or allow the FDA to order recalls. This fight will not be settled anytime soon. *This post has been updated to reflect that while Guthy-Renker is a dues-paying member of the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors (ICMAD), which drafted the alternative legislation with Mary Kay, Guthy-Renker does not have a public stance on any proposed legislation relating to the FDA.

The global liquid detergent chemicals market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 4.73% during the period 2016-2020. Commenting on the report, an analyst from the research team said: Shift toward concentrated liquid detergent formulations will be a key trend for market growth. Water scarcity is a growing environmental concern across the world, with only about 0.01% of the total water available for immediate consumption. So, vendors of liquid detergents, such as P&G, Unilever, and Henkel, are focusing on introducing concentrated liquid detergents. Compared to standard liquid detergents that have an average water content of 65%-70%, concentrated formats contain only 5%-50% water. According to the report, high demand for fragrance will be a key driver for market growth. The scent of the product is one of the leading factors influencing the purchase of household detergents. Questions Answered: What will the market size be in 2020 and what will the growth rate be? What are the key market trends? What is driving this market? What are the challenges to market growth? Who are the key vendors in this market space? What are the market opportunities and threats faced by the key vendors? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the key vendors?

At 10:17 IST, the Sensex, was up 25.84 points or 0.09% at 28,090.45. The Nifty was currently down 1.40 points or 0.02% at 8,641.15. The Sensex rose 71.49 points, or 0.25% at the day's high of 28,136.10 in early trade. The index fell 40.25 points, or 0.14% at the day's low of 28,024.36 at the onset of trading session. The Nifty index rose 15.05 points, or 0.17% at the day's high of 8,657.60 in early trade. The index fell 16 points, or 0.19% at the day's low of 8,626.55 at the onset of trading session. The market breadth indicating the overall health of the market was strong. On BSE, 1,178 shares rose and 761 shares fell. A total of 113 shares were unchanged. The BSE Mid-Cap index was currently up 0.34%. The BSE Small-Cap index was currently up 0.47%. Both these indices outperformed the Sensex. In overseas stock markets, Asian shares were mixed today, 17 August 2016, after New York Fed President William Dudley said the Fed could raise interest rates as soon as September, prompting investors to pause after rallies in recent weeks. US stocks eased from record highs yesterday, 16 August 2016, with the S&P 500 losing 0.55% as investors weighed hawkish comments by Federal Reserve officials against sharp gains for oil futures, a weakening dollar and fresh consumer-price data that showed US inflation remains tepid. Dudley said a rate hike in September was possible, while Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said the US economy is likely strong enough for at least one rate increase before the end of 2016, with two a possibility. Dudley cited evidence of wage gains and a tighter labor market that could boost inflation. Their comments came ahead of an annual meeting of central bankers from around the world in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, next week. Metal shares were mixed. Vedanta (up 1.59%), Hindalco Industries (up 1.36%), National Aluminium Company (up 0.95%), Tata Steel (up 0.75%), Hindustan Copper (up 0.70%), Steel Authority of India (up 0.54%) and NMDC (up 0.20%), edged higher. Jindal Steel & Power (down 0.06%), Bhushan Steel (down 0.37%), JSW Steel (down 0.38%) and Hindustan Zinc (down 0.77%), edged lower. Meanwhile, copper price edged lower in the global commodities markets. High Grade Copper for September 2016 delivery was currently down 0.28% at $2.166 per pound on the COMEX. Most FMCG shares edged higher. Britannia Industries (up 1.53%), Dabur India (up 0.80%), Jyothy Laboratories (up 0.69%), GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare (up 0.68%), Tata Global Beverages (up 0.65%), Colgate Palmolive (India) (up 0.60%), Hindustan Unilever (up 0.21%) and Nestle India (up 0.04%), edged higher. Godrej Consumer Products (down 0.11%), Marico (down 0.37%), Bajaj Corp (down 0.46%) and Procter & Gamble Hygiene & Health Care (down 0.66%), edged lower. Piramal Enterprises (PEL) rose 1.96% after the company's announcement that its wholly owned US subsidiary has entered into an agreement to acquire 100% stake in Ash Stevens Inc, a US-based contract development and manufacturing organisation (CDMO), in an all cash deal. PEL will pay $42.95 million for the acquisition. There will be additional earn-out consideration capped at $10 million, subject to achievement of certain EBITDA targets, payable over the next six months. The transaction is expected to be completed by end of August, PEL said. This acquisition adds niche potent molecule manufacturing capabilities to the portfolio of services offered by PEL's pharma solutions business, the company said. Ash Stevens reported revenue of about $18.3 million in FY 2015 (twelve months ended 30 September 2015). The announcement was made after market hours yesterday, 16 August 2016.

(Photo: The Enquirer/Bob Free)Buy Photo For the Enquirer’s 175th anniversary this year, we are digging into our archives to showcase historic photographs that capture the people, places, events and character of this community that we have chronicled and been a part of the past 175 years.   In the middle of the last century, Cincinnati, like nearly every American city, underwent a period of urban renewal. As people spread outside of the city basin to the suburbs on the hills, Downtown was remade. Outdated and out-of-style buildings were torn down to be replaced by modern brick and glass structures. The Downtown section from Sixth and Walnut streets to the Ohio River had been known as the Bottoms, a blue-collar neighborhood of diverse ethnic makeup—Irish, German, and African-American. People lived there, worked there, and worshipped there. In April 1955, the city was in transition. A block had been cleared for Procter & Gamble to construct their new headquarters at Sixth and Sycamore streets. A block away on Broadway, the century-old Allen Temple AME Church, an African-American church, was a relic of an older, completely different Cincinnati. The Moorish-style church with round-topped minarets and bell-arch motif, was built for the K.K. Bene Israel synagogue in 1852. Allen Temple worshipped there from 1870 to 1979, when the church was torn down to make way for the P&G towers. The Cincinnati of old slowly disappeared.

Energy companies rose with the price of oil, but stocks have been locked in an up-and-down pattern for more than a week. As the dollar weakened, the price of oil rose for the fourth day in a row to sustain a recent recovery and metals prices also rose. The Labor Department said inflation remains low, as prices paid by consumers were unchanged in July. Most stocks were down, but for the second day in a row, the biggest losses went to traditionally safe investments like telecom and utility companies. Bond prices also inched lower. The dollar has been very strong over the last few years compared to other currencies. Early this year it looked like the dollar would stay at those elevated levels because the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates while other global central banks were cutting them to stimulate their economies. John Cannally, chief economic strategist for LPL Financial, said the Fed has changed course. By leaving interest rates where they are, it has allowed the currency to weaken a bit, aiding U.S. manufacturing and energy companies and other exporters. “The Fed is using the dollar as sort of a tool of monetary policy,” he said. “The Fed wants to give China and emerging markets time to heal and get their houses in order.” The Dow Jones industrial average lost 84.03 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,552.02. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index slid 12 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,178.15. The Nasdaq composite fell 34.90 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,227.11. Stocks have been setting records recently, but it’s been more than a week since they rose for two days in a row. The market hasn’t made many big moves over the last month. The Labor Department said prices paid by consumers were unchanged in July as gas and other energy prices kept inflation down. Core inflation, which leaves out food and fuel prices, inched up just 0.1 percent for the month. Overall, inflation is up just 0.8 percent over the last year. That’s far below the 2-percent target set by the Federal Reserve, and investors concluded that means the Fed is less likely to raise interest rates soon. The dollar fell to 100.25 yen from 101.25 yen. The euro rose to $1.1277 from $1.1183. The weakening dollar boosted energy and metals prices Tuesday.

Brent crude, a benchmark used to price international oils, rose 88 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $49.23 a barrel in London. Oil prices climbed last week after steep losses in June and July.

Stocks have wavered lately as investors review mixed reports about the U.S. economy as they try to get a sense of its health. On Tuesday the Federal Reserve said U.S. factories cranked out more autos, machinery and chemicals in July, which suggests manufacturers might be recovering, though growth remains little changed from a year ago and manufacturers aren't adding many jobs.

Beauty products maker Coty posted results that surpassed expectations, but said little about its purchase of Procter & Gamble's beauty business, a $15 billion deal expected to close in the next few months.

 US stocks fall after mixed reports, with utilities skidding Joe Mcdonald, Associated Press Aug. 17, 2016, 12:00 AM 12 facebook linkedin twitter email print FILE - In this Friday, Nov. 13, 2015, file photo, the American flag flies above the Wall Street entrance to the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks slipped early Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2016, as investors continued to sell phone company and utility stocks. Materials companies are the exception, as they’re trading higher as the dollar weakens. Investors are also sifting through reports that showed inflation remained weak in July, but home building and factory production improved. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) syndication.ap.org BEIJING (AP) — Asian stock markets were mostly higher Wednesday after Wall Street declined. Shares in China were mixed after leaders approved a plan to give foreign investors more access to Chinese equities through Hong Kong. KEEPING SCORE: Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.5 percent to 23,016.18 points and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 advanced 0.5 percent to 16,679.89. Seoul's Kospi added 0.9 percent to 2,017.94 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 rose 0.4 percent to 5,492.40. The Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.1 percent to 3,105.12. Benchmarks in New Zealand and Malaysia advanced while Taiwan and Singapore declined. WALL STREET SLIDE: U.S. stocks slid as investors sold phone company and utility shares. Stocks have wavered lately as investors review mixed reports about the U.S. economy, trying to get a sense of its health. On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve said U.S. factories cranked out more autos, machinery and chemicals in July, which suggests manufacturers might be recovering, though growth is little changed from a year ago. The Commerce Department said the pace of home construction grew by the most since February. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 84.03 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,552.02. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 12 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,178.15. The Nasdaq composite fell 34.90 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,227.11. HONG KONG STOCK LINK: China's Cabinet announced approval of an initiative that would give foreign investors more access to Chinese stocks by linking exchanges in Hong Kong and the mainland city of Shenzhen. Hong Kong is Chinese territory but its financial system is open to foreign investors while mainland markets are sealed off from global capital flows. The Chinese premier said the move will help to reinforce Hong Kong's status as a financial center, and it helped to boost sentiment there on Wednesday. But analysts said the influx of foreign money into Chinese stocks is likely to be modest. A similar measure to link Hong Kong with the Shanghai stock exchange took effect in 2014. Shares in Shenzhen were higher on Wednesday. FED WATCH: Investors looked ahead to Wednesday's release of notes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's July meeting for insight into the debate among board members over when to raise rates. One member of the policy-making board, William Dudley, said earlier it was premature to rule out further tightening this year and another member, Dennis Lockhart, said Tuesday there could be two hikes in 2016. The Fed's earlier decision to hold off raising rates has weakened the dollar, helping exporters. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 100.57 yen from Tuesday's 100.33 yen. The euro edged down to $1.1274 from $1.1276. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 22 cents to $46.35 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose 84 cents on Tuesday to $46.58. Brent crude, used to price international oils, tumbled 34 cents to $48.89 in London. It added 88 cents the previous session to $49.23 per barrel.

BY KEVIN GARCIA THE BROWNSVILLE HERALD Emergency workers are urging people to celebrate the New Year responsibly, having seen many holiday-related accidents over the years. Brownsville Police Department Sgt. Kirk Massey said that during his 10 years on the force, excess drinking during celebrations have caused many of the problems he has been called in to handle. He said calling a taxi or getting a designated driver could greatly decrease the chances of an accident. If people are going to go out and celebrate, and they are, they should at least have a designated driver or be prepared to stay where they are at, Massey said. If someone shows signs of intoxication, do not let them drive, Massey said, noting that slurred speech or weakened coordination are strong indicators not to drive. If they cant speak correctly and they cant keep their own balance, then they are not going to have any coordination behind the wheel at all, Massey said. Take the keys. Lt. Jorge Lerma of the Brownsville Fire Department said that the number of traffic accidents emergency workers respond to increases during holidays. He added that during his time as a firefighter, he has seen many victims of drunk driving. In 13 years (with the department) you see a lot of stuff and a lot of times you cant really pinpoint a particular accident, Lerma said. Anytime there is a death, it is usually a pretty gruesome scene. He said such scenes have led many to ease up on their own drinking, including some firefighters. If you have a tendency to drink and drive it really makes you think twice, Lerma said. Theres a number of firefighters that either ease up on their drinking or are a lot more responsible Massey added that driving isnt the only danger that intoxication presents to drinkers. Usually alcohol is going to impair a person, not only the way they drive, but also the way they behave, he said. If you are with somebody that is drunk, and there is going to be an argument, just walk away. Massey encourages calling the police as soon as possible. He explained that the polices role is to calm people down, not make arrests, unless the officers see potential for violence. Discuss Print Posted in Community on Sunday, December 29, 2002 12:00 am.

Shares in China were mixed after leaders approved a plan to give foreign investors more access to Chinese equities through Hong Kong. KEEPING SCORE: Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.5 percent to 23,016.18 points and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 advanced 0.5 percent to 16,679.89. Seoul's Kospi added 0.9 percent to 2,017.94 and Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 rose 0.4 percent to 5,492.40. The Shanghai Composite Index shed 0.1 percent to 3,105.12. Benchmarks in New Zealand and Malaysia advanced while Taiwan and Singapore declined. WALL STREET SLIDE: U.S. stocks slid as investors sold phone company and utility shares. Stocks have wavered lately as investors review mixed reports about the U.S. economy, trying to get a sense of its health. On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve said U.S. factories cranked out more autos, machinery and chemicals in July, which suggests manufacturers might be recovering, though growth is little changed from a year ago. The Commerce Department said the pace of home construction grew by the most since February. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 84.03 points, or 0.5 percent, to 18,552.02. The Standard & Poor's 500 index slid 12 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,178.15. The Nasdaq composite fell 34.90 points, or 0.7 percent, to 5,227.11. HONG KONG STOCK LINK: China's Cabinet announced approval of an initiative that would give foreign investors more access to Chinese stocks by linking exchanges in Hong Kong and the mainland city of Shenzhen. Hong Kong is Chinese territory but its financial system is open to foreign investors while mainland markets are sealed off from global capital flows. The Chinese premier said the move will help to reinforce Hong Kong's status as a financial center, and it helped to boost sentiment there on Wednesday. But analysts said the influx of foreign money into Chinese stocks is likely to be modest. A similar measure to link Hong Kong with the Shanghai stock exchange took effect in 2014. Shares in Shenzhen were higher on Wednesday. FED WATCH: Investors looked ahead to Wednesday's release of notes from the U.S. Federal Reserve's July meeting for insight into the debate among board members over when to raise rates. One member of the policy-making board, William Dudley, said earlier it was premature to rule out further tightening this year and another member, Dennis Lockhart, said Tuesday there could be two hikes in 2016. The Fed's earlier decision to hold off raising rates has weakened the dollar, helping exporters. CURRENCY: The dollar gained to 100.57 yen from Tuesday's 100.33 yen. The euro edged down to $1.1274 from $1.1276. ENERGY: Benchmark U.S. crude shed 22 cents to $46.35 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose 84 cents on Tuesday to $46.58. Brent crude, used to price international oils, tumbled 34 cents to $48.89 in London. It added 88 cents the previous session to $49.23 per barrel.

U.S. stocks slipped early Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2016, as investors continued to sell phone company and utility stocks. Materials companies are the exception, as they’re trading higher as the dollar weakens. Investors are also sifting through reports that showed inflation remained weak in July, but home building and factory production improved. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks are slipping Tuesday as investors continue to sell phone company and utility stocks. Materials companies are the exception, as they’re trading higher as the dollar weakens. Investors are also sifting through reports that showed inflation remained weak in July, but home building and factory production improved. KEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average lost 48 points, or 0.3 percent, to 18,587 as of 11:40 a.m. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index slid 8 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,182. The Nasdaq composite fell 25 points, or 0.5 percent, to 5,237. CONSUMER PRICES: The Labor Department said prices paid by consumers were unchanged in July as gas and other energy prices kept inflation down. Core inflation, which leaves out food and fuel prices, inched up just 0.1 percent for the month. Overall, inflation is up just 0.8 percent over the last year. That’s far below the 2-percent target set by the Federal Reserve, and investors concluded that means the Fed is less likely to raise interest rates soon. Bond prices dipped and the yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.58 percent from 1.56 percent. CURRENCIES: Following the price report, the dollar fell to 100.40 yen from 101.25 yen. The euro rose to $1.1275 from $1.1183. The weakening dollar continued to boost materials companies Tuesday, as it could make their products more affordable in markets outside the U.S. Packaging maker WestRock rose 85 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $44.85. Industrial gas company Praxair got a boost following reports it’s in talks with Germany’s Linde about a possible deal. Its stock rose $6.38, or 5.4 percent, to $124.41. OIL: Benchmark U.S. crude added 67 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $46.41 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark used to price international oils, rose 61 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $48.96 a barrel in London. STEEP LOSS: Tea maker Hain Celestial Group delayed its quarterly report because of accounting issues and said it doesn’t expect to reach its financial projections for the year. The stock tumbled $15.20, or 28.5 percent, to $38.20. SUIT UP: Uniform maker Cintas said it will buy G&K Services, a uniform and facility services maker, for $97.50 a share, or $1.93 billion. G&K Services advanced $15.01, or 18.3 percent, to $97.14 and Cintas stock gained $8.03, or 7.5 percent, to $115.45. BLEMISH: beauty products maker Coty posted results that surpassed expectations, but said little about its purchase of Procter & Gamble’s beauty business, a $15 billion deal expected to close in the next few months. Coty said it’s “premature” to comment on how the combined business will do. The stock skidded $1.93, or 6.5 percent, to $27.82. MAXXED OUT: TJX, the parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other stores, traded lower after it forecast a disappointing third-quarter profit. The retailer said higher wages and the strong dollar will hurt its results. The company had reported solid quarterly results and raised its estimates for the full year. Its stock gave up $3.49, or 4.2 percent, to $79.28. AIG DEAL: Insurer American International Group said it will sell its United Guaranty mortgage insurance unit to Arch Capital for $3.4 billion in cash and stock. AIG has been streamlining its business and said early this year that it would spin off United Guaranty. Its stock picked up 5 cents to $59.27. HOME SWEET HOME: The Commerce Department said the rate of home construction grew 2.1 percent in July, mostly because of an increase in apartment construction. It was the strongest pace of new home starts since February. FACTORY FACTS: The Federal Reserve said U.S. factories cranked out more autos, machinery and chemicals in July. Factory output rose 0.5 percent. Overall industrial production, which includes utilities and mining, grew 0.7 percent as people used more air conditioning in response to hot weather. The results suggest manufacturers might be recovering from a series of challenges that have held them back, including the strong dollar and slower overseas growth. Still, factory output is just 0.2 percent higher than it was a year ago and manufacturers aren’t adding many jobs. GAME ON: Dick’s Sporting Goods announced better-than-expected quarterly results and raised its projections for the year. Its stock jumped $4.08, or 7.4 percent, to $58.97. OVERSEAS: Britain’s FTSE 100 fell 0.4 percent and the CAC 40 in France shed 0.5 percent. Germany’s DAX fell 0.4 percent. Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell 1.6 percent as the yen gained against the U.S. dollar. South Korea’s Kospi eked out a 0.1 percent loss and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index was down 0.1 percent.     Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It’s one more step towards stamping out a pathetic taboo Illustration by Andrzej Krauze Tuesday 16 August 2016 07.56 EDT Last modified on Thursday 25 August 2016 14.29 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close It’s easier than you think to become an Olympic sensation. You can train for years, sacrifice hugely and perform to your highest ability in front of an audience of billions. But you can also just mention that you’re on your period, and become globally famous. This is what Fu Yuanhui, China’s rather adorable swimmer, did when asked about her team’s fourth place finish in the medley relay. “It’s because my period came yesterday, so I felt particularly tired,” she said. Because she is Fu Yuanhui and rather adorable, she finished the sentence by saying “this isn’t an excuse, I still didn’t swim well enough”. It may not have been an excuse, but it was a disclosure that was revolutionary, because, stupidly, recognising that sportswomen have to perform even with menstrual cramps and while bleeding is still exceptional and newsworthy. UK company to introduce 'period policy' for female staff Read more Fu isn’t the first sportswoman to admit that her uterus shedding its endometrial lining has impacted her job: Heather Watson famously alluded to her period affecting her performance in the Australian Open last year. But she only implied, and the media inferred, that “girl things” meant bleeding. What Fu did was extraordinary. And how pathetic that that’s the case, especially when new research done by Georgie Bruinvels and colleagues at UCL found that 37% of elite athletes suffer heavy menstrual bleeding, about the same proportion as “regular” runners at the 2015 London Marathon, but – despite the impact that anaemia can have on performance – only 22% had sought medical advice. A recent survey by WaterAid found that 56% of women in the UK avoid swimming during their period. Fu Yuanhui’s statement is being called historic. Since most historical records were written or sung by men, we don’t know much about how women managed their menstruation or how they were treated in the past. Probably, as the historian Sara Read has written, they bled into their clothes, much as many rural Indian women still prefer to do (when I asked one woman whether she would wear a sanitary pad, she said, “we don’t even wear underwear. What do you expect? We are jungle people.”). Facebook Twitter Pinterest Fu Yuanhui with her 100m backstroke bronze medal. Photograph: David Gray/Reuters There are hints here and there in history that women’s ability to bleed without injury was seen by male medical professionals as either mystical, marvellous or terrifying. Read cites Lazare Rivière, author of a 17th-century anatomy guide, as saying that the womb was the source of “six hundred miseries and innumerable calamities”. The Roman author Pliny thought menstrual blood was poisonous and could cause “wine to sour, trees and crops to die, mirrors to cloud, swords to blunt, and dogs to go mad should they chance to taste it”. I’ve always wanted to blunt a sword and cloud a mirror. As for women who didn’t bleed and were menopausal: they were often locked up. You think your period is just a pain, but given the amount of effort expended by men to keep bleeding women in their place, it’s obviously a superpower. My period may hurt: but not talking about menstruation hurts more | Rose George Read more Daft menstrual taboos persist in certain countries and religions, where menstruating women have amazing power to make pickles go rotten (leading to a delightful Procter & Gamble campaign called Touch the Pickle), pollute temples, make snakes materialise or sour buffalo milk. But we have no grounds to feel superior in our supposedly enlightened societies. How many women and girls ask for time off work for menstrual cramps, or admit that that’s why they are off sick? How many would admit to feeling appalling and weepy because of premenstrual tension? The only situation in which periods are talked about in the workplace – be it an office or an Olympic stadium – is in banter and jokes, and that is not funny. This self-censorship is why women have put up with sanitary products being taxed as luxury items for years. It’s why it takes on average 10 years for women to be diagnosed with endometriosis, a gynaecological condition linked with painful periods, because either women and girls or GPs – or both – think painful periods are normal. (I was prescribed prescription-strength painkillers for years and never thought to question it; nor did a series of GPs.) Menstruation: the last great sporting taboo Read more But things are better now, right? Bodyform’s recent ad Blood, showing women doing sport, fiercely, and bleeding to a soundtrack of thumping electronica, must mean that talking about periods and performance is now acceptable. This girl can, even when she bleeds. Except the only blood they don’t show is the menstrual kind (I’ve no idea why, they refused an interview). All this positive period empowerment, and yet we’re still being shown blue liquids in most period advertising and treating an athlete’s statement of fact as a massive revelation. Athletes, who must know their bodies and abilities intimately, may well be the best women to loudly talk about periods. So Fu deserves her bronze in the 100m backstroke, but I’d give her a gold medal too: not for admitting that she had a period, but for conveying that it was no big deal. And now, women, let’s get over ourselves and follow in her wake.

Home Church & Ministries U.S. World Politics Entertainment living Opinion Michael Phelps' Net Worth After Winning 28th Olympic Medal at Rio 2016: The Legendary Swimmer's Career Earnings & Endorsement Deals By Junrell Calunod Aug 16, 2016 | 2:58 AM After wrapping his Rio 2016 Olympic stint with six medals, American swimmer Michael Phelps has cemented his record as the most decorated athlete in the history of the international sporting event. The legendary swimmer now holds a total of 28 Olympic medals, with 13 gold medals from individual events, and 10 gold medals from team races. After winning his 28th Olympic medal at the Rio games, the net worth of the 31-year-old swimmer is expected to rise with the incentives and endorsement deals that are coming in. Before Rio games, he is already the richest swimmer alive. Phelps' Net Worth Per Money Nation, as of Aug. 10 this year, Phelps' net worth is at $44.3 million. Ninety eight percent of his earnings came from endorsement deals, while the remaining two percent came from swimming competitions. Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit According to the website, Phelps' net worth is 65 percent bigger than the net earnings of two-time NBA MVP Stephen Curry and 38 percent bigger than the net income of U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. It is also 651 times bigger than the net worth of a typical American family. FX News Call projected that Phelps' Under Armour sponsorship deal alone pays him $5 million. He has also signed lucrative endorsements deals with popular brands like Speedo, Louis Vuitton, Visa, Omega watches, HP, Head and Shoulders, Hilton Hotels, Kellog, and Procter & Gamble, among others. Moreover, Celebrity Net Worth has a higher projection on Phelps' net earnings. The website estimated that prior to the Rio 2016 Olympics, the legendary swimmer's net worth has already mounted to $55 million. Most of these earnings came from his lucrative post-Olympics career, where he attracted dozens of sponsors and appeared in various commercials. More Earnings Are Coming The medals earned by Phelps during his fifth Olympic appearance at the Rio games are expected to boost his net worth. Moreover, the legendary swimmer has earned five gold medals and one silver medal. Per Forbes, American athletes who won medals at the Rio games will receive cash incentives from the U.S. government. At the top of that, according to Time, the actual medal has its value. A gold medal, which is made up of some 24-karat gold, sterling silver and copper that costs around $366. Aside from the actual value of Phelps' Olympics medals and the incentives from the government, Phelps is also expected to receive cash rewards from his present endorsement deals. Speedo, his sponsor in the 2008 Olympics, reportedly gave him $1 million bonus after a successful run in the event.

On an adjusted basis, the company would have earned $45.7 million or EPS of $0.13, which was $0.07 a share higher than the Street estimate of $0.06 a share. Last year, it earned $0.08 a share. Coty recorded 6 percent growth in net revenues to $1.075 billion, which was higher than the analysts' predictions of $1.05 billion. The company's Like-for-like recorded a drop of one percent.

helping News provided by American Red Cross Aug 16, 2016, 15:40 ET Share this article WASHINGTON, Aug. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- American Red Cross disaster workers are helping thousands of Louisiana residents with a safe place to stay and food to eat despite closed roads and continued flooding making it challenging to get relief supplies to where they are needed. "The current flooding in Louisiana is the worst natural disaster to strike the United States since Superstorm Sandy," said Brad Kieserman, vice president, Disaster Services Operations and Logistics for the Red Cross. "The Red Cross is mounting a massive relief operation, which we anticipate will cost at least $30 million and that number may grow as we learn more about the scope and magnitude of the devastation." Monday night more than 8,400 people sought refuge in 36 Red Cross and community shelters in Louisiana. More than 1,000 Red Cross disaster volunteers have been mobilized from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to help with the Louisiana relief efforts. The Red Cross is also mobilizing over 60 disaster response vehicles, nearly 40,000 ready-to-eat meals, and dozens of trailers filled with shelter and kitchen supplies.

Then, he launched his own company, Walker & Company Brands, and released his first product line — the Bevel Shave System. "A lot of folks, when we started, thought that is was a bad idea" says Walker. "Well, they were wrong." Bevel is a shaving system geared towards people of color, an answer to Walker's own frustrating experience with the shaving products available to him. Traditional razors irritated his skin and depilatory creams were equally unpleasant. The products he bought were often consigned to the "ethnic aisle" in stores. "We wanted to ensure that our products have the dignity or were presented with as much dignity as other products within that aisle. And I think we've succeeded in a very very big way." Bevel is now available at Target and earlier this month, Walker & Company Brands released the Bevel Trimmer. "I think Silicon Valley is growing a hell of a lot more amenable to companies like ours because we are proving that there is such a unique need for this thing." Walker's plans for the future are all big. "We want to build something with as much legacy as a Proctor & Gamble, with as much legacy as a Johnson & Johnson and Unilever, and we're not going to stop until we give our all to that."

More than 200 women are involved in a class-action lawsuit with Chaz Dean Inc. and distributor Guthy-Renker over claims that Wen by Chaz Dean Cleansing Conditioner led to hair loss, hair breakage, rash, and balding. The New York Times reports that Guthy-Renker has agreed to a $26.25 million settlement but it’s not yet been approved by a federal judge. If approved, the settlement would repay $25 to anyone who’s purchased a bottle of the cleansing conditioner and up to $20,000 to people who experienced adverse reactions; they can make claims to be reimbursed for treating said reactions as well as for injury awards. Guthy-Renker stands by the product, citing studies that it believes demonstrates that the product does not cause hair loss, and instead characterized the pending settlement as a “business decision.” Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a safety alert for the cleansing conditioner but that’s about all it can do here — it doesn’t have the power to order recalls of cosmetics like it can with pharmaceuticals. Rather, the FDA monitors complaints submitted on its web site and decides whether to investigate. The agency could take action if it found that a product was mislabeled or contaminated. Proposed legislation from Senators Dianne Feinstein and Susan Collins would require cosmetic companies to notify the FDA of “serious adverse” reactions as they happen as well as submit an annual report of all “adverse events” and would give the FDA recall power. The bill would collect fees to study the safety of cosmetics ingredients and has been endorsed by major companies like Estée Lauder, Johnson & Johnson, and Procter & Gamble. Some independent companies like Mary Kay* support an alternative bill that would still require notification of injuries but would not collect money for safety evaluations or allow the FDA to order recalls. This fight will not be settled anytime soon. *This post has been updated to reflect that while Guthy-Renker is a dues-paying member of the Independent Cosmetic Manufacturers and Distributors (ICMAD), which drafted the alternative legislation with Mary Kay, Guthy-Renker does not have a public stance on any proposed legislation relating to the FDA.

Some cities have boomed in the years since the national unemployment rate hit 10 percent in October 2009, while others have limped back to normalcy. A CNBC analysis of the latest per-capita real personal income data from 2009 to 2014, provided by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, reveals which major metros (with minimum populations of 1 million) have led the strongest rebounds above the nationwide average of 7.2 percent. 1. San Jose, Calif. (22%) With an impressive 22 percent growth in real personal income, San Jose tops our list. Income here rose three times more than the national average. The growth may be due in part to the fact that the metro area is home to nearly eight times as many developers as average, and they take in $147,220 per year on average, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2. Houston (15.4%) Houston has seen significant income growth over the past several years, but it has also felt the impact of falling oil prices since 2014. Unemployment ticked higher in June to 5.5 percent. "We have had some significant layoffs in the oil and gas industry," said Patrick Jankowski, senior vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership. However, Jankowski noted that the uptick in unemployment could be seasonally skewed, and he pointed to management and real estate sectors that continue to grow. 3. Grand Rapids, Mich. (14.7%) The Grand Rapids-Wyoming metro area in Michigan has diversified greatly over the past 20 years, according to Birgit Klohs, CEO of The Right Place, a Western Michigan development corporation. "We have a health-care and life-sciences sector that 20 years ago did not exist," she said. Housing prices are booming, and the unemployment rate came in at only 3.4 percent in June. On top of that, local business confidence levels are running near a 16-year high. 4. San Francisco (14.6%) While the impressive 14.6 percent gain in personal income recorded in the San Francisco-Oakland metro area might have you thinking about a move, it is worth noting that the average resident dedicates nearly 40 percent of expenditures to housing, which is above the national average. 5. Oklahoma City (13.4%) Although Oklahoma City has felt the recent impact of falling oil prices, the energy sector only accounts for 3 percent of the city's employment base, according to Kurt Foreman, executive vice president of the Oklahoma City Chamber of Commerce. He cites General Electric and Boeing's research centers in Oklahoma City as examples of the city's shift to mechanical engineering. 6. Cincinnati (12%) Notable local employers Kroger and Procter & Gamble employ more than 30,000 Cincinnatians, contributing to the metro's low unemployment rate of 4.4 percent. 7. Dallas (11.7%) While the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area just makes the list, the local economy is showing strength beyond the time horizon analyzed here. Of the 12 largest U.S. metro areas monitored by the BEA, Dallas boasts the second-largest percentage gains in total nonfarm payrolls through 2016 — second only to Phoenix.
