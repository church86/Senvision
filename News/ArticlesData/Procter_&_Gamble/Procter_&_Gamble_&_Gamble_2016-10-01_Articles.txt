Is Losing to the Competition Where P&G falls short against its consumer goods rivals right now. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Oct 2, 2016 at 3:15PM Image source: Procter & Gamble. Procter & Gamble's (NYSE:PG) latest business trends haven't given investors much to cheer about. Organic sales growth slowed for the second straight year in fiscal year 2016, and the consumer goods giant lost market share in four of its five main product categories while holding steady in just one -- its fabric care and home care division. Part of P&G's poor growth can be blamed on a weak selling environment and economic struggles in some of its geographies. Yet the company is also trailing competitors in a head-to-head match up in these important ways. Volume gains The biggest standout when comparing P&G to rivals is its volume figures. Consumer giants typically aim for organic growth that's led by volume gains, or at least includes a healthy mix of volume and pricing upticks that together produce higher sales. Unilever (NYSE:UL) is a great example as it has managed 2.2% improved volume over the past six months that powered organic growth of nearly 5%. In contrast, P&G's volume shrunk by 1% in the 12 months ended this past June, and so the company had to rely exclusively on higher prices to deliver its modest 1% overall organic growth uptick. The good news for shareholders is that a rebound could be in the cards. Volume figures rose last quarter across all of P&G's product divisions, at an average of 2%. That result was still well below Kimberly-Clark's (NYSE:KMB) 4% volume jump, but it does close the gap somewhat. Innovation Innovation is critical to P&G's business since it needs to constantly update existing brands (new and improved) while launching the occasional game-changing product (e.g., Febreze, Swiffer) to stay ahead of rivals. "Winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires innovation," executives explain in the 10-K. "Innovation has always been, and continues to be, P&G's lifeblood." The company has struggled in this area recently. Sure, products like Pampers Swaddlers diapers, Gillette Fusion razors, and Tide Pods detergent are doing well. But P&G hasn't introduced a new hit brand worth over $1 billion in annual sales in more than a decade. Image source: P&G. By contrast, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is on an innovative roll lately. The healthcare titan got one-quarter of its sales last year from products that it introduced in just the past five years, which is a testament to an innovation strategy that's backed by $9 billion of annual spending on research and development -- up 10% since 2013. Compare that to Procter & Gamble's R&D commitment that has held steady at $2 billion in each of the last three years. Value focus By its own admission, P&G hasn't done an especially good job at catering to the value niche of many of its competitive markets. In razors, for example, the company is enjoying strong growth with premium Gillette Fusion products, but at the same time has lost share from price-based competitors like Unilever's Dollar Shave Club. "We need to do more work on the lower end of the portfolio," Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told investors in a conference call. That weakness has also left P&G vulnerable to store brands that are offered directly from retailers. Wal-Mart recently credited its private label products for helping produce strong growth in its laundry and home care aisles. The same negative dynamic could quickly shift online, where e-commerce giant Amazon.com is eyeing a few of P&G's strongest categories, diapers, and laundry detergent, with its own private label brands. P&G's brand shedding initiative should boost sales growth and profitability. BT: Before Tax. Image source: P&G. P&G executives are taking steps to close the gap against competitors on all these metrics. The company's portfolio reboot initiative, for one, is likely to boost overall volume growth. And major cost cuts should help it compete better on pricing. In fact, progress on these goals recently gave management the confidence to project the first annual uptick in organic sales growth in years. Yet the 2% gain it is forecasting for fiscal year 2017 would still put P&G behind most of its global rivals. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

According to an industry study done by the video intelligence company Vidooly, Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is India's most viewed Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) brand on YouTube. HUL emerged as the leading FMCG brand with over 238 million views on video sharing platforms such as YouTube. The study by Vidooly was conducted across five leading FMCG brands in India. The brands were HUL, Proctor & Gamble (P&G), Nestle India, ITC, and the Godrej Group. HUL (238.7 million views) is closely followed by P&G with 238.05 million views across YouTube. Nestle India comes third with an average of 74 million views across social media. ITC and the Godrej Group take the fourth and fifth spot with 23 million views and 18 million views online respectively. Talking about the research, Nishant Radia, CMO and co-founder of Vidooly, says, "YouTube is the largest video platform in the world. Most FMCG brands not only host their ad campaigns on their YouTube channel, but also use YouTube as a strategic platform to engage with their consumer base. Younger audiences are increasingly consuming video content on YouTube, hence, FMCG brands are directing a major chunk of their digital ad spends to YouTube with engaging and original content." Within HUL's portfolio, Lakme had the highest number of views, while Gillette has the highest number of views in P&G's portfolio. In terms of number of views, Nescafe, Yippee, and Godrej Cinthol followed in that order. Indians spent over 4,00,000 hours watching YouTube ads this year according to a statement by Google. And, with cheaper data plans and wider availability of 4G ready smartphones, more people are consuming video content on their smartphones. 85SHARES Follow afaqs!

The Procter & Gamble product, having spoofed itself for years with advice on how to become more "mantastic," posts to its 2.6 million Facebook followers a steady stream of video games, prize entries, and advertisements as short as two seconds. Creating "thumb-stopping" content is the goal, and marketers are doing everything they can to achieve it. That includes using neuroscience to study which visual and audio cues offer the best bet to grabbing and keeping an impatient smartphone user's attention. Estimates show that the average person looks at his or her smartphone as much as 150 times a day. The attention is there, but it's just not long-lived. "You get the three-second audition," said Frank Amorese, media director at Heineken USA. "If you are relying on the 14th or 15th second to do the heavy lifting of the ad, it's not going to work." - Ever-changing mobile landscape - Advertisers are in a dizzying race to connect with customers as new mobile-borne social media platforms emerge and evolve. "The landscape changes every six months," Amorese said. "It's changing at an increasingly fast rate." Digital ad spending is projected to reach $72.1 billion in 2016, growing at a rate of 21 percent and now comprising almost 37 percent of the overall market, according to eMarketer. Social media accounts for $15.4 billion of this. Heineken has doubled its spending on digital ads to 30 percent over the last five years. The dominance of smaller mobile devices has heightened the challenge of capturing the attention of potential shoppers. Ads must be tailored depending on whether they are being seen on a widescreen television, a tablet or a smartphone and must not demand too much time if a consumer is merely glancing at a feed and not planning on a lengthy stay. "We have to really identify how do consumers engage with every single platform and then what is the creative experience we need to give them," said P&G chief brand officer Marc Pritchard at the four-day Advertising Week conference in New York this week. "But it also has to look like one brand because people have 5,000 ads coming at them every day and that's 10 times what it was just 10 years ago." - Measuring 'sharing velocity' - Anna Fieler, chief marketing officer at PopSugar, a women's shopping and content site, said marketers are devising benchmarks like "sharing velocity" to monitor resonance. "Shareability is the gold standard of how engaged people are," she said. "People like it so much that they want to share it with someone else." Not all Ads place the brand front and center. Frito-Lay, which spends about 40 percent of its advertising budget on digital media, offers tips on its Facebook feed on professional mentoring and networking, in addition to the usual fare of ads that aim to excite and amuse. "People are using social media to build their (personal) brand," said Jeff Klein, vice president of brands and portfolio marketing. Sometimes Frito-Lay just "takes a little bit of a back seat." - 'Upload videos like crazy' - Much of the buzz at the Advertising Week conference was the wildfire growth of video streaming and broadcast of live events. Facebook vice president Will Platt-Higgins predicted video could comprise 80 percent of all smartphone content by 2020. "You've got the perfect marriage of basically a supercomputer, which is in your pocket, plus super powerful wifi, plus a video composer and a high-definition camera," he said. "All of that together creates the perfect storm for all of us to upload videos like crazy and that's what's happening." The growth of video also opens up new opportunity for rivals like Twitter, which has lagged Facebook in terms of building profits from ads. Twitter posted 18 percent growth in advertising revenue last quarter spurred by video. It is betting that marketers will see more upside in plans for live events in pro football and other sports. Video "is the number one ad format for us now and it barely existed a year ago," said Matt Derella, vice president of global revenue and operations at Twitter.

Leisure Home LBoard ‘We can’t stop Umno members, who belong to NGOs, taking part’ Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Advertising on mobile: it’s all about ‘stopping the thumb’ AFP | October 2, 2016 Creating "thumb-stopping" content is the goal, and marketers are doing everything they can to achieve it. NEW YORK: Almost 80 years old, the deodorant Old Spice is learning new tricks for finding customers in the era of smartphones and social media. The Procter & Gamble product, having spoofed itself for years with advice on how to become more “mantastic,” posts to its 2.6 million Facebook followers a steady stream of video games, prize entries, and advertisements as short as two seconds. Creating “thumb-stopping” content is the goal, and marketers are doing everything they can to achieve it. That includes using neuroscience to study which visual and audio cues offer the best bet to grabbing and keeping an impatient smartphone user’s attention. Estimates show that the average person looks at his or her smartphone as much as 150 times a day. The attention is there, but it’s just not long-lived. “You get the three-second audition,” said Frank Amorese, media director at Heineken USA. “If you are relying on the 14th or 15th second to do the heavy lifting of the ad, it’s not going to work.” Ever-changing mobile landscape Advertisers are in a dizzying race to connect with customers as new mobile-borne social media platforms emerge and evolve. “The landscape changes every six months,” Amorese said. “It’s changing at an increasingly fast rate.” Digital ad spending is projected to reach $72.1 billion in 2016, growing at a rate of 21 percent and now comprising almost 37 percent of the overall market, according to eMarketer. Social media accounts for $15.4 billion of this. Heineken has doubled its spending on digital ads to 30 percent over the last five years. The dominance of smaller mobile devices has heightened the challenge of capturing the attention of potential shoppers. Ads must be tailored depending on whether they are being seen on a widescreen television, a tablet or a smartphone and must not demand too much time if a consumer is merely glancing at a feed and not planning on a lengthy stay. “We have to really identify how do consumers engage with every single platform and then what is the creative experience we need to give them,” said P&G chief brand officer Marc Pritchard at the four-day Advertising Week conference in New York this week. “But it also has to look like one brand because people have 5,000 ads coming at them every day and that’s 10 times what it was just 10 years ago.” Measuring ‘sharing velocity’ Anna Fieler, chief marketing officer at PopSugar, a women’s shopping and content site, said marketers are devising benchmarks like “sharing velocity” to monitor resonance. “Shareability is the gold standard of how engaged people are,” she said. “People like it so much that they want to share it with someone else.” Not all Ads place the brand front and center. Frito-Lay, which spends about 40 percent of its advertising budget on digital media, offers tips on its Facebook feed on professional mentoring and networking, in addition to the usual fare of ads that aim to excite and amuse. “People are using social media to build their (personal) brand,” said Jeff Klein, vice president of brands and portfolio marketing. Sometimes Frito-Lay just “takes a little bit of a back seat.” ‘Upload videos like crazy’ Much of the buzz at the Advertising Week conference was the wildfire growth of video streaming and broadcast of live events. Facebook vice president Will Platt-Higgins predicted video could comprise 80 percent of all smartphone content by 2020. “You’ve got the perfect marriage of basically a supercomputer, which is in your pocket, plus super powerful wifi, plus a video composer and a high-definition camera,” he said. “All of that together creates the perfect storm for all of us to upload videos like crazy and that’s what’s happening.” The growth of video also opens up new opportunity for rivals like Twitter, which has lagged Facebook in terms of building profits from ads. Twitter posted 18 percent growth in advertising revenue last quarter spurred by video. It is betting that marketers will see more upside in plans for live events in pro football and other sports. Video “is the number one ad format for us now and it barely existed a year ago,” said Matt Derella, vice president of global revenue and operations at Twitter. “It’s risen extremely fast and it’s driven by consumer behavior.” Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

Saritha Rai @SarithaRai More stories by Saritha Rai October 2, 2016 — 5:00 PM EDT October 2, 2016 — 5:00 PM EDT Amazon to Spend $5 Billion to Dominate India E-Commerce When Jeff Bezos donned a bandhgala jacket two years ago and posed for photographs in India, he wasn't just promoting Amazon.com Inc.'s year-old business in the country. The web retailer's chief executive officer was also putting his reputation on the line to break into the emerging e-commerce market. Jeff Bezos visits Bangalore in September 2014. Photographer: Manjunath Kiran/AFP via Getty Images Now, with 80 million products for sale, 120,000-plus merchants and more than two dozen warehouses, Bezos's protégé Amit Agarwal is aiming to make Amazon the country's top online store by sales ahead of the Diwali shopping season. Known as the "festival of lights," the run-up to the celebration is India's biggest retail event, when consumers buy everything from clothes and electronics to jewelry and cars. Indians will spend as much as $1.7 billion online during Diwali this year, according to RedSeer Consulting. Flipkart Ltd., India's top web retailer, and local rival Snapdeal, are well aware that they're facing a critical test this year amid Amazon's onslaught. All three are flooding newspapers, billboards and TV shows with ads and are offering discounts for Diwali, which now makes up a third of annual e-commerce sales. At stake is the future of India's online shopping market, as well as Amazon's global expansion plans, which had faltered after it failed to conquer China. "This season could decide who'll be the ultimate winner," said Haresh Chawla, a Mumbai-based partner at private equity firm India Value Fund Advisors and an angel investor. "The loser will get unnerved and the victor can build internal confidence and rally the troops for the bigger game." Reaching consumers in India has never been easy—just ask Unilever NV or Procter & Gamble Co., which spent decades making inroads into the market. There are 22 official languages, and consumption habits differ from place to place. On top of that, there are supply chain inefficiencies, high real estate costs, lack of skilled workers, along with poor infrastructure and labyrinthine regulations.  Even so, the prospect of becoming the main web store in a country of 1.25 billion people who are just learning how to shop online is tantalizing. RedSeer Consultancy Pvt. estimates that annual online sales will be $80 billion to $100 billion by 2020 from the current estimate of about $13 billion. "Barely 2 percent of the population shops online," said Mrigank Gutgutia, who covers consumer internet trends at the Bangalore-based researcher. "It is still only the tip of the India e-commerce iceberg." Merrill Lynch estimates that Amazon may sell as much as $81 billion in merchandise by 2025, up from $3.7 billion last year. Becoming India's top web retailer would be a vindication for Amazon. In China, the only other market with more than a billion people, the company has little to show after a dozen years, thanks to the dominance of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and other local web retailers. "The biggest opportunity and the biggest challenges are both in India," said Agarwal, chief of Amazon India. "It's going to be a great Diwali." Amit Agarwal.  Photographer: Namas Bhojani/Bloomberg After graduating from Stanford University, the 42-year-old spent part of his career at Amazon's Seattle headquarters as Bezos's technical shadow, a coveted position at the company that grooms future leaders by giving them a front-row view of how the business is run. To expand inventory, Amazon has been recruiting sellers at breakneck speed. The web retailer has deployed an army of white-and-orange Chai Carts with emissaries who teach sellers how to list inventory and handle returns over cups of milky chai tea. Another service, called Feet-on-Street, sends people on motorbikes to help merchants photograph and market their wares. Another big task will be moving beyond India's eight big urban areas and into smaller towns and cities. "There could be a protest on the streets, potholes on the road, labor challenges, warehouses in different regions with varied rules, goods trucks passing through state checkpoints—and after all this, the package still has to arrive at the customers’ doorstep overnight if not within hours," Agarwal said. One key goal for Amazon—its tagline for Diwali is tyohar bade dilwala (the festival with a big heart)—is to lure dormant shoppers and first-time buyers. There are important trends working in Amazon's favor. Exploding smartphone use offers the promise of bringing online commerce to hundreds of millions of buyers and sellers. An Amazon pick up point in New Delhi. Photographer: Mint/Hindustan Times via Getty Images All of these efforts in India cost money; in June, Amazon said it will invest an additional $3 billion in India on top of an already allocated $2 billion. "An open funding tap could help Amazon offer discounts and bleed out some of its rivals," said RedSeer's Gutgutia. For Flipkart and Snapdeal, the upcoming Diwali season will determine their ability to stay in the game. For smaller e-commerce startups, survival is at stake. Many, like AskmeBazaar—which advertised aggressively during Diwali last year—shut down before they could make it to this one.

Amazon's top rival in India is in advanced discussions with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to sell a minority stake to the U.S. retailer for as much as $1 billion. The Indian web retailer is adding 10,000 temp workers to handle last-mile logistics, and is offering financing plans to put expensive purchases within customers' reach. Flipkart's tagline this year is ab itne me itnaaa milega: now you'll get so much for so little. Delhi-based Snapdeal, whose backers include Alibaba and Softbank Group Corp., re-branded itself ahead of the shopping season, with a red box logo (its pitch: unbox zindagi, or unbox life).  Consumers like Nivedita Raju, are already noticing the difference. The Bangalore-based government official, who buys DVDs, herbs and knickknacks online, said that when she was looking for a computer title that was out-of-stock on Amazon, the web retailer had it printed and dispatched within 10 days. "It’s a very different level of customer service than Indians have been used to," she said. A shopper carries boxes of toys on his head in Mumbai two days before Diwali.

She recently earned the National Outstanding DAR Service for Veterans Award, the highest veterans service award the group bestows. Kathleen M. Zinskie found a way to combine her love of history and heritage with her longing to serve. A member of the Pennsylvania State Society Daughters of the American Revolution over the past seven years, Mrs. Zinskie dedicates her life to give back to those who served. “I got into (PSSDAR) for the history, but I stayed for the service,” the Olyphant resident said on a recent afternoon. “We do so much.” As the group’s chairwoman, Mrs. Zinskie, works with veterans’ hospitals and homes around the state to improve the quality of life for the facilities’ inhabitants. She also developed a project to dedicate local Revolutionary War soldiers’ graves and collaborated with a local sewing and crocheting group to donate lap blankets to local veterans’ establishments, among other outreach programs for those who served. In June, Mrs. Zinskie earned the highest veterans service award PSSDAR bestows: the National Outstanding DAR Service for Veterans Award. “I started out by going down to Gino (J.) Merli (Veterans’ Center) and saying, ‘What do you need?’” Mrs. Zinskie said. “From there, I learned what the wants were and met the residents. I wanted to help any way I could.” Between 2014 and 2015, Mrs. Zinskie oragnized efforts to deliver 300 comfort bags to women veterans at six veterans’ homes and eight veterans’ hospitals throughout the state. The bags contained note cards, novels, pens, nail files, combs and brushes. A donation from Proctor & Gamble also secured toilet paper, paper towels, napkins, shampoo, conditioner, feminine hygiene products, air fresheners and other body and home products the facilities needed. Her fellow members helped her in each part of the project, from coordinating donations to storing products, sometimes in her Olyphant home, to hand-delivering the bags to the veterans. The veterans’ deep appreciation and gratitude overwhelms Mrs. Zinskie the most. While she delivered some comfort bags, she met a woman who worked as a clerk in New Jersey during World War II that left Mrs. Zinskie with a lasting impression about the importance of giving back to veterans. “(The woman) was upset, and she said, ‘I wish I was born a man, because I could have made a difference,’” Mrs. Zinskie recalled. “(Women veterans) don’t believe they deserve to be called ‘veterans.’ I will never forget her saying that to me. “Everybody played a part. I think of it like the Butterfly Effect: take her out of the equation, and something else may have happened. She did make a difference.” Mrs. Zinskie champions for recognition for those who served, and that, combined with her lifelong love of history, sparked her interest in joining the DAR. She always held a deep interest in the past, often visiting historical places and landmarks instead of amusement parks and beaches with her husband, Harry, and their three children, Christina, Jessica and Nick. “My daughter was in school, and the teacher asked the class to raise their hand if they went to this monument or this historic site, and my daughter put her hand up for almost all of them,” Mrs. Zinskie said, laughing. “I can’t help it. I just love, love history.” Mrs. Zinskie’s interest in the past prompted her to find out more about her ancestors. In her research, she found lots of information about her family’s origins, but, most importantly, she realized people during those times didn’t have to serve in battle to be a part of the American Revolution. “Anyone who paid taxes or owned property, they contributed,” said Mrs. Zinskie, who confirmed 15 patriots in her bloodline through ancestry research. “You didn’t necessarily have to have fought. There were lots of people who were donating and supporting the cause to start the country.” Mrs. Zinskie always has volunteering on her mind. Even leisurely activities, like cross-stitch, become a vehicle for her to help others. Mrs. Zinskie auctions off the pieces she makes at DAR events and donates all of the proceeds to her cause. She cross-stitched all 300 bags she donated during the comfort project. Mrs. Zinskie insists she couldn’t go through with service projects or give back like she has without the help of her fellow DAR members. She said she is fortunate enough to work part-time with her husband so she can dedicate time to service projects if her fellow members can’t. “I can pick up for the time constraints, and someone would do it for me if I couldn’t,” she said. “We’re all women, and we all have a common goal: we want to serve.” Contact the writer: gmazur@timesshamrock.com, @gmazurTT on Twitter.

Sections Deseret NewsOpinion Opinion Mel S. Lavitt: Facebook deal a lost opportunity for the state and local communities By Mel S. Lavitt For the Deseret News Published: Oct. 2, 2016 12:10 a.m. Updated: Oct. 1, 2016 7:52 p.m. 4 Comments One thing that makes Utah great is our win-win attitude and sincere desire to find common ground on challenging issues. Because of this, Utahns solve problems few other states can. From taking a compassionate approach to immigration to forging an elegant solution balancing LGBTQ rights and religious freedom, we have continually demonstrated our ability to engage in civil discourse on divisive issues and emerge with policies that unify. Utah is unique and successful because we collaborate to find solutions. However, sometimes despite our efforts, differences are unable to be reconciled. The recruitment of Facebook to the state is a recent example. It is my hope that its failure is merely the exception to Utah’s reigning rule of partnership. I was born and raised in Denver and spent most of my career in investment banking in New York City and San Francisco. My family and I first came here in 1976 to ski and, like so many other transplants, ended up adopting Utah as our home. I currently serve as chairman of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development (GOED) Board. This position has provided a great opportunity to champion Utah as a wonderful place to live, work and raise a family. I have watched the state facilitate effective processes that bring companies and communities together to create win-win opportunities for economic prosperity. There are too many economic successes to name them all, but to mention a few: Box Elder County being selected in 2007 as the home of Procter and Gamble’s first new expansion plant in the United States in decades, aerospace manufacturer Syberjet expanding in Cedar City, and the well-known success story of Goldman Sachs in Salt Lake City. While these projects are in various corners of the state and represent different industries, there’s one thing they have in common: the companies have flourished in Utah because of strong collaboration among the state, local governments, companies and communities that host them. As it has in the past with other large capital expenditure projects, GOED played a role in trying to attract Facebook to the state. We did so because we have seen firsthand the follow-on investment and job creation that can occur when an enterprise data center locates here. This approach paid significant dividends in past projects. For example, Oracle and eBay both solidified their relationships with the state through early data center investments. Those relationships later led to large-scale employment centers and economic development in surrounding communities. We hoped we could replicate that model with Facebook. When it became apparent there was discord between the city and county over the local incentive deal terms, terms that were being negotiated independent of state involvement, we brought both parties to the table to attempt to find a win-win solution for the project. We believed we were making progress with Salt Lake County and West Jordan City, and were disappointed when Salt Lake County and West Jordan City could not find a way to narrow the gap between their respective viewpoints. Also, the back and forth that found its way into the press unnecessarily politicized the situation and complicated further negotiations with the company. This negativity impeded our efforts to seek a compromise and eroded the company’s confidence in the state and in our local governments. So instead of a win-win, we have ended up with a lose-lose all around. The Facebook negotiation was the first breakdown of this kind that I have witnessed, and I see it as a lost opportunity for the state and our local communities. It could also have a negative effect on future recruitments. Now that the dust has settled, where do we go from here? Our process of collaborating to find constructive solutions has worked in the past. And with a few tweaks, GOED believes it will work in the future. We will help local communities define, refine, and execute on their economic development goals, and ensure there is more transparency with the public. We will work to ensure local governments and the state are better harmonized in our joint recruitment efforts. We will work with our legislative colleagues to ensure local incentives are more appropriately aligned with state incentives, which are always post-performance, and that incentives in all forms respect the Utah taxpayer. We will seek out opportunities and projects that provide a strategic benefit to the state, and hope we can empower our local communities to better partner and communicate so good projects end in good deals. That is the Utah way. Bottom line: Utah is still No. 1 in my book, and with all of us working together it will remain so in the future. Mel S. Lavitt is board chairman of the Utah Governor’s Office of Economic Development. 4 Comments Like that? Read this.

Fox Lloyd Roitstein Pamela Bartling Buffett Rick Chudacoff Dr. E. Terence Foster William Baird Robert Goldstein Clarence Wigington Omaha Central Hall of Fame to add 10 names From staff reports Oct 1, 2016 (…) Omaha Central High School will induct 10 people into its Hall of Fame on Thursday, Oct. 6. A 6:30 p.m. dinner in the school’s courtyard will precede the 7:30 p.m. induction ceremony at the school. Tickets are $50 a person or $400 for a table of eight, and are available from the Central High Foundation office, 402-556-1996. These people are being inducted this year into Central’s Hall of Fame: +9  William Baird William Baird (Class of 1930): Baird’s career in law was long and distinguished; his name lives on in one of Nebraska’s largest and most prestigious law firms. Baird’s roots at both Central and in the Omaha law community ran deep. His great aunt was an early principal at then-Omaha High and the first female high school principal in Nebraska. And both his grandfathers had law practices in Omaha that dated to the 1880s. After graduating from law school in 1937, Baird joined his father in a law firm that became known as Baird and Baird. He moved on to larger firms before in 1970 becoming the co-architect of a merger that created the BairdHolm firm. He served for years as legal counsel to the Westside School District, a legacy in education that continues at the firm. During his 44-year career, he received the Nebraska State Bar Association’s award of special merit and served on the bar’s ethics and discipline committee and chief justice nominating commission. Baird also served as president of the Nebraska Bar Association. Baird interrupted his law career to serve his country during World War II, commanding naval gun crews on troop escort vessels in the Atlantic. Since his 1981 death, his name has continued to stand in Nebraska for the highest standards in the legal profession. +9  Pamela Bartling Buffett Pamela Bartling Buffett (Class of 1960): Buffett is a passionate advocate and supporter of a variety of causes. Motivated by a deep connection to serving mankind, Pamela is particularly drawn to social justice organizations, scholarships that connect students to an education, and improving the quality of life for people with special needs. During her time as a student, Pamela was grateful for Central High School’s commitment to connecting and embracing a variety of cultures to build a diverse community. Being immersed in CHS’s actively inclusive environment gave Pamela the lifetime gift of a deep respect for humanity that has greatly influenced the mission and purpose of her philanthropy. Pamela and her late husband, Fred Buffett, started the Rebecca Susan Buffett Foundation in memory of their daughter. The Rebecca Susan Buffett Foundation supports many organizations that serve people with mental illnesses, provides scholarships for higher education and serves underprivileged children through the Northstar Foundation and Girls Inc. in Omaha. Pamela’s most recent charitable endeavor is the Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center. Another role Pamela feels blessed to have in her life is being the mother to her daughter Sarah. With a resilient heart and compelling vision, Pamela remains steadfast during times of either success or sadness, both outcomes that she has experienced in her life. Most of all, she finds continuous inspiration, gratitude, and joy in seeing her support empower the many lives she has touched, discovering that giving to others was truly a gift within itself. +9  Rick Chudacoff Rick Chudacoff (Class of 1967): In the world of songwriting and music production, few can claim the kind of cross-genre success achieved by Rick Chudacoff. Chudacoff helped to pen or produce top-selling hits in pop, R&B, Christian and country, including co-writing the 1995 Grammy-winning “Somewhere in the Vicinity of the Heart.” He first broke into the music business playing with the major label disco funk band Crackin’. He made his first big mark as a songwriter/arranger by collaborating on Robbie Dupree’s “Steal Away,” a catchy hit that reached No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1980. He then received production credits on Matthew Wilder’s 1983 pop standard “Break My Stride,” which hit No. 5 on the Hot 100, and Patti LaBelle’s 1984 R&B hit “New Attitude,” among others. In his varied career, he has co-written top 10 hits in pop (“Steal Away”), R&B (The Temptations’ “Look What You Started,” No. 8 in 1986), contemporary Christian (“I Call Your Name,” Clay Crosse, No. 1 in 1994) and country (Shenandoah’s “Somewhere in the Vicinity of the Heart,” No. 7 in 1995). In all, productions on which he’s been involved account for more than 25 million units sold. Through his own music company, Gouda Music Group, he continues to write and produce music in a number of genres. +9  Dr. E. Terence Foster Dr. E. Terence Foster (Class of 1959): A University of Nebraska-Lincoln colleague once referred to Foster as “a kind of engineering wizard,” citing his knowledge of the field as well as his grasp of its mathematical, physical and scientific underpinnings. That depth of knowledge certainly served Foster well as he built an outstanding career that bridged both engineering practice and education. President of his senior class at Central, Foster earned bachelors and masters degrees from MIT before completing his doctorate in structural engineering from Cal-Berkeley. He served two years as an officer in the Vietnam era U.S. military, working at the Pentagon and in The Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Foster returned to Omaha in 1970 to work with an engineering technology subsidiary of HDR and later served as a vice president for technology at Union Pacific before joining the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s engineering faculty in 1991. He founded the university’s construction engineering degree program and became associate director of the Durham School of Architectural Engineering. In 2014, he was honored with the Engineering Education Excellence Award by the National Society of Professional Engineers, awarded annually to recognize faculty who have linked engineering education with professional practice. It was a fitting cap to a career devoted to both. +9  Donald T. Fox Donald T. Fox (Class of 1947): “Worldly” hardly begins to describe Donald Fox, whose ability to navigate the ins and outs of international law helped him found a prominent international law firm in New York City and to work to promote human rights throughout the world. After graduating from Harvard (1951), and NYU Law School (1956), Fox attended the University of Paris as a Fulbright Scholar, earning two more law degrees. As a litigator with a large Wall Street firm, Fox used his international experience to help U.S. clients acquire European companies and finance foreign projects. That work led to the founding of his own international law firm in 1968. He has spent decades helping foreign firms export, license technology and acquire businesses in the United States, as well as advising American firms doing business abroad. Beyond business, Fox became active in the drive to promote independent judicial systems and deter oppressive governments around the world. As chairman of the American Association for the International Commission of Jurists, he has conducted missions and written reports on human rights abuses and also evaluated national judicial systems, work that has taken him from Latin America to Hungary and Ethiopia. +9  Robert Goldstein Robert Goldstein (Class of 1955): During a visionary and pioneering advertising career, Goldstein helped turn products like Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent, Head and Shoulders shampoo and Charmin bathroom tissue into household names. Goldstein served as Procter & Gamble’s vice president of advertising for nearly a decade before his life was tragically cut short at age 50. He served as chairman of the Association of National Advertisers and as a leader of numerous other advertising organizations. He was among the first to recognize the potential for cable television, making one of the first sizable advertising buys on CNN and TBS. Goldstein was also very active in Cincinnati’s Jewish community. Goldstein’s life and career came to a sudden close in 1987 in a rafting accident in British Columbia. He was mourned by Procter & Gamble’s CEO as a man whose impact on advertising was great, not due to the dollars he commanded but his high standards and principles. In 1988, he was elected to the National Advertising Hall of Fame. +9  Aubray Woods Orduna Aubray Woods Orduna (Class of 1965): Orduna for more than four decades has displayed her commitment to the nursing profession, from caring bedside to served as the longtime dean of nursing at Omaha’s Clarkson College. After graduating from the nursing school at Murray State University in Kentucky in 1970, she practiced briefly in Pittsburgh before returning to her native Omaha in 1975 to serve as a unit nurse at Clarkson Hospital. Her skills and leadership abilities were quickly recognized. She soon after became the assistant head nurse in the unit and by 1979 was named a nursing instructor at Clarkson College. In 1989, she returned to the hospital in an administrative role, by 1995 rising to director of evaluation and case management. She then returned to the college in 2000 as director of diversity services, developing and she implemented a strategic plan to meet the college’s diversity goals and mentor 50 minority students for the Clarkson College Gateway to Success Scholarship program to become BSN prepared nurses. From there, she climbed into the college’s top leadership positions, first directing the practical nursing program and then all undergraduate nursing programs before being named dean of nursing in October of 2009 — a position she still holds. Orduna has also served as president of the Omaha Black Nurses’ Association since 2005 and has received numerous awards, including a positive image of nursing award from the Nebraska Nurses Association, Clarkson’s Caring Kind Award and a volunteer of the year award from the Kidney Foundation of Nebraska. +9  Lloyd Roitstein Lloyd Roitstein (Class of 1964): Service to others is part of the Boy Scout Oath, and Lloyd Roitstein certainly took that to heart. Roitstein has been in scouting for 62 years, as a Boy Scout, volunteer leader, and 40 years as a professional scouter, including two decades leading the three-state Mid-America Council headquartered in Omaha. He joined scouting at age eight and achieved scouting’s highest rank of Eagle Scout, remaining active while attending Central. Roitstein started his career in 1971 in Omaha and advanced his career here until being promoted to Scout Executive in Illinois in 1984 and the National Staff in 1988 and then returning to Omaha in 1992 was named president/scout executive of the Mid-America Council. In 2010, the Council was recognized as No. 1 in the Boy Scouts of America. Roitstein’s leadership was tested in June 2008 when a tornado struck Little Sioux Scout Ranch in Iowa killing four scouts and injuring nearly 50. Under his leadership, he led a team of volunteers who responded to all facets of the tragedy. Months later, he led the scouts along with their parents and leaders who were involved in this tragedy to the White House to meet with President George W. Bush. Before he retired in 2011, Roitstein was awarded the Distinguished Executive Award by the Boy Scouts of America. +9  Benjamin Wiesman Benjamin Wiesman (Class of 1949): Omaha’s long tradition as a telephone call center can be traced to the work of Ben Wiesman, one of many ways the real estate developer helped build his native city. Six years after graduating from Central, Wiesman founded his first real estate company. By the late 1960s, he expanded from apartment development into commercial real estate. He became an innovator in the concept of “build and lease,” building and furnishing new structures to the specifications of businesses and leasing them back as the property manager. After developing with Whirlpool Corp. the first worldwide 800 calling system at its headquarters in Michigan, he believed Omaha’s central location would make it an ideal location for toll-free call centers. He subsequently built the nation’s first building designed specifically for telephone and computer operations (Ramada and Best Western Hotels), and proceeded to develop facilities for numerous hotel, car rental and telecommunications firms. Some of his work has been preservation and renovation of historic buildings downtown, including the Flatiron Building and Ford Plaza Building. For his efforts, Downtown Omaha Inc. presented him with its Visionary Pioneer Award. +9  Clarence Wigington Clarence Wigington (Class of 1902): Wigington left his mark both on Omaha and his adopted home of St. Paul, Minnesota, as one of the Midwest’s first African-American architects. By the time Wigington enrolled at Central in 1898, he won three first-place drawing certificates during the 1898 Trans-Mississippi Exposition in Omaha. Subsequently graduating in 1902, he worked for notable Omaha architect Thomas Kimball, becoming the city’s first African-American architect. After quickly promoted to junior draftsman, he started his own firm in 1908. Local credits include an addition to St. John’s AME Church, the rebuilding of Zion Baptist Church after the city’s 1913 tornado and the Bloomfield and Crutchfield Apartments — now on the National Register of Historic Places. He later moved his family to St. Paul and served for 35 years in the city architect’s office. The Pavilion on Harriet Island in St. Paul—one of three buildings he designed now on the national register — was renamed in 1998 Clarence W. Wigington Pavilion. Wigington designed ice palaces for St. Paul’s annual Winter Carnival. Becoming active in civil rights, he helped to create and served as president of the St. Paul Urban League. He died in 1967, but his legacy lives on in many of his surviving structures. Tags Firm Thomas Kimball Donald T. Fox William Baird Tell us your good news!

John Kasich talks about the presidential campaign, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and other topics during the daily news briefing at the White House in Washington, Sept. 16, following a meeting with the president in the Oval Office. (Carolyn Kaster, Associated Press) Print Email Thomas Suddes, cleveland.com By Thomas Suddes, cleveland.com The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 02, 2016 at 5:04 AM, updated October 02, 2016 at 7:01 PM comments And Clinton fans wonder why Hillary and Bill Clinton's slicing and dicing of the English language ticks people off. John Kasich won't be on next month's ballot, but might want to be on 2020's. So, arguably, Ohio's Republican governor is continuing to run for president. August: John Kasich is getting the band back together in New Hampshire, perhaps with an eye on 2020 Kasich, whose term as governor will end in January 2019, is positioning himself as the adult in the room. Nationally, he's been making all the right moves as to Republican movers and shakers: big manufacturers and U.S.-based traders. Oh, and on Sept. 16 Kasich told NBC's Chuck Todd, "It's very, very likely I will not" vote for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. "The chances are minuscule," Kasich said. In mid-September, Kasich went to the White House (as a visitor) to join Democratic President Barack Obama in asking Congress to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The partnership is a huge trade deal among the United States and 11 other nations (not including China). Kasich wants to help Obama pass Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal And on Sept. 15, The Wall Street Journal published a Kasich op-ed, "A vote against trade is a vote against growth." In contrast, Trump opposes the TPP. So does Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. One of her campaign's websites proclaims, "Hillary Clinton opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, period." But the word "now" seems to be missing from the Clinton campaign's statement: For, as Trump charged during Monday's debate, Clinton did say in 2012 — albeit, before the TPP had been finalized — that the TPP "sets the gold standard in trade agreements." (And Clinton fans wonder why Hillary and Bill Clinton's slicing and dicing of the English language ticks people off.) Also last week, Kasich joined former Defense Secretary Robert Gates (who served in Obama's Cabinet as well as George W. Bush's) in a Columbus foreign policy forum presented by an outfit called the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition. Among the coalition's chairman's caucus members ("most dedicated supporters") are Cincinnati's Procter & Gamble (one of Ohio's Fortune 500 companies), the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Coca-Cola, Google, Microsoft and Walmart. John Kasich, Robert Gates pick at presidential candidates' foreign policy stances The coalition said that in 2015, "Ohio exported $50.7 billion in goods and services overseas, and trade supported more than one in five local jobs." The coalition, in case you're wondering, supports "strategic investments to elevate development and diplomacy and defense" — that is, trade.  On energy policy, Kasich has demonstrated Statehouse responsibility. For example, he said he would veto any bill that kills the benchmarks for solar and wind power that Ohio electricity producers must meet. The benchmarks are now frozen, but the freeze expires Dec. 31.  State Sen. William Seitz, a suburban Cincinnati Republican, is expected to massage a pending bill so it would replace the existing law's energy mandates and standards, which would otherwise kick in again Jan. 1. The General Assembly first approved the standards in 2008, virtually unanimously. For now, it's unclear whether there's enough support in the Ohio Senate and House for weakening the energy standards. But the Senate, controlled by Republicans continuously since January 1985, isn't exactly considered forward-thinking. On energy standards, Kasich is forward-thinking, as he was in expanding Medicaid, despite grandstanding yelps from the usual Capitol Square mossbacks.  In January 2021, on Inauguration Day for whoever's elected president in 2020, Kasich will be 68; Clinton 73; Trump 74. So there's nothing fantastical about what Kasich's doing.  RNC Chairman Reince Priebus says GOP could bar John Kasich from another presidential run Whether Clinton wins next month (at this writing, she's leading Trump in the RealClear Politics poll average), or Trump wins, voters will likely be in the market for change in 2020. That's why Kasich will keep on keeping on, making sure the GOP's power brokers see his resume, know his face — and remember his name.

NEW YORK — Stocks climbed Friday as banks made a rapid recovery following a steep fall a day ago. Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains Friday as Germany's largest bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rebounded 17.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,312. Financial stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon following reports that some hedge funds were moving their business out of Deutsche Bank. On Friday, bank stocks and the broader market regained almost all of those losses. Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management, said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are causes for concern, including the health of Italy's banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and regulation getting tighter, there are plenty of reasons for investors to avoid bank stocks. That didn't stop the financial sector, the weakest sector in the market this year, from rallying on Friday. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added 94 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $66.59 and Citigroup gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $47.23. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world's oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. Investors hope energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.65, or 1.6 percent, to $102.92 and EOG Resources rose $1.66, or 1.7 percent, to $96.71. Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.02, or 3.4 percent, to $152.51 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.52, or 1.7 percent, to $89.75 and Wal-Mart rose $1.39, or 2 percent, to $72.12. Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the information technology consulting and outsourcing firm said it's investigating possible bribes paid to officials in India. Cognizant said it's looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has informed the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant also said its president Gordon Coburn resigned. The stock fell $7.37, or 13.4 percent, to $47.63. Major stock indexes set records this quarter thanks mostly to tech stocks. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 12 percent over the last three months. Apple, the most valuable company in the S&P 500, surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Microsoft, the next-largest company, rose 13 percent and another tech giant, Google parent Alphabet, leaped 14 percent. Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.60 percent from 1.56 percent. More Business Cozy retirement?

Honest Co., which is now five years old, sells a range of products including diapers, soap, lotion and cleaning products - all free from 'harsh chemicals'. But the Wall Street Journal, in a report published in March, said it tested Honest Co.'s detergent at two laboratories and found it had sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) - an ingredient it told customers it would never use. The detergent bottles for years had claimed the product is 'free of' SLS. Honest Co. - co-founded by Jessica Alba, pictured - had long denied claims its laundry detergent contained an ingredient it told customers it would never use At the time, the company strongly denied the claims stating its detergent did not contain SLS, but rather sodium coco sulfate, an ingredient it says is a 'gentler alternative.' It also said conducted 'rigorous testing' and accused the Journal of being both wrong and 'reckless.' Honest executives said in March the company had no plans to reformulate the detergent. Chemists interviewed by the Journal said sodium coco sulfate is a mixture of cleaning agents that includes a large amount of SLS.  The company - valued at $1.7 billion also provided Wall Street Journal with a certificate stating there was no SLS in the product from its detergent manufacturer, Earth Friendly Products, according to the statement.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Feeling blue? Jessica Alba cuts a chic figure in indigo... Google takes aim at Uber with Waze Rider 'carpool' app that... Share this article Share A Wall Street Journal article claims that the Honest detergent (pictured) contains sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)  There have been rumors that the company may go public or be sold to a bigger player But now it appears the company is finally backing down and is planning to roll out a new laundry detergent in 2017 that doesn't contain sodium coco sulfate.  The company told The Wall Street Journal, Honest said it is making changes to multiple products, including dish soap, detergent and other cleaners, 'utilizing an advanced sugar-based surfactant technology to further improve the efficacy of our products.' The company said its research team 'consistently works to innovate across our entire product line while adhering to The Honest Company's uncompromising safety standards.' Replacing the laundry detergent with a new formula would remove any ambiguity over the SLS issue, which caused Honest to face backlash from some customers.  The move comes at a crucial time for the company which is in discussions with several large companies about a potential sale or initial public offering, which could also be an option.  The company has had talks with consumer-products giants including Unilever PLC,Procter & Gamble Co., Clorox Co. and Johnson & Johnson, according to the Jorunal.  Honest currently generates roughly $300 million in annual sales, and was valued at $1.7 billion during a private funding round in August 2015.  In Alba's 2013 book The Honest Life (pictured), Alba listed SLS as a 'toxin' that consumers should avoid This isn't the first time Honest is launching new versions of its products after facing scrutiny from consumers and the media. Honest Co. is also facing a class action lawsuit from customers who say the company's sunscreen failed to protect them, causing sun burns. That case is still pending and Honest Co. has said its products are safe.  The Honest Company was started in 2012 with 17 products and now has more than 120 items, which are sold at more than 4,000 retailers across the United States and Canada.

Investors hoped Deutsche Bank and the financial system in general were in better shape than they had feared. Banks made the biggest gains Friday as Germany’s largest bank tried to reassure investors about its financial health. Investors hope Deutsche Bank will be able to negotiate down the massive cost of settling a U.S. investigation into mortgage securities. Energy companies rose as the price of oil continued to move higher, and strong earnings from Costco sent consumer stocks higher. Deutsche Bank is the largest lender in Germany, and investors are concerned about not only its plunging stock price, but the potential effect on the financial system if Deutsche Bank gets into serious trouble and the German government does not help it. Those fears faded on Friday. “People came to the realization that this isn’t likely to be a big systemic risk that ripples through the financial sector,” said Nate Thooft, head of global asset allocation for Manulife Asset Management. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 164.70 points, or 0.9 percent, to 18,308.15. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index rebounded 17.14 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,168.27. The Nasdaq composite rose 42.85 points, or 0.8 percent, to 5,312. The Department of Justice wants Deutsche Bank to pay $14 billion to end an investigation into mortgage-backed securities, and the stock jumped Friday after a report that the bank could settle the case with a smaller payment. Deutsche Bank’s U.S.-listed stock rose $1.61, or 14 percent, to $13.09. The stock has been pummeled this year and is trading near all-time lows. Financial stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon following reports that some hedge funds were moving their business out of Deutsche Bank. On Friday, bank stocks and the broader market regained almost all of those losses. Thooft said he does not think banks are in great danger, but he said there are causes for concern, including the health of Italy’s banks. Meanwhile, with interest rates so low and regulation getting tighter, there are plenty of reasons for investors to avoid bank stocks. That didn’t stop the financial sector, the weakest sector in the market this year, from rallying on Friday. Among U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase added 94 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $66.59 and Citigroup gained $1.43, or 3.1 percent, to $47.23. Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 41 cents to $48.24 a barrel in New York, and it rose 8 percent over the last three days. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 18 cents to $49.06 a barrel in London. Oil prices surged this week after the nations of OPEC, which collectively produce more than one-third of the world’s oil, surprised investors with an agreement on a small cut in production. Investors hope energy companies will book larger profits as a result. Chevron jumped $1.65, or 1.6 percent, to $102.92 and EOG Resources rose $1.66, or 1.7 percent, to $96.71. Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale jumped $5.02, or 3.4 percent, to $152.51 after it reported a profit that was larger than analysts expected. Companies that make and sell household necessities also climbed. Procter & Gamble gained $1.52, or 1.7 percent, to $89.75 and Wal-Mart rose $1.39, or 2 percent, to $72.12. Cognizant Technology Solutions tumbled after the information technology consulting and outsourcing firm said it’s investigating possible bribes paid to officials in India. Cognizant said it’s looking into potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and has informed the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. Cognizant also said its president Gordon Coburn resigned. The stock fell $7.37, or 13.4 percent, to $47.63. Major stock indexes set records this quarter thanks mostly to tech stocks. The S&P 500 technology index climbed 12 percent over the last three months. Apple, the most valuable company in the S&P 500, surged 18 percent, partly on indications of strong sales for the newest iPhones. Microsoft, the next-largest company, rose 13 percent and another tech giant, Google parent Alphabet, leaped 14 percent. Bond prices sank. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.60 percent from 1.56 percent. Stocks that pay high dividends, like utilities and real estate and phone companies, traded lower. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline picked up 2 cents to $1.49 a gallon. Heating oil rose 2 cents to $1.53 a gallon. Natural gas slipped 5 cents to $2.91 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $8.90 to $1,317.10 an ounce. Silver rose 3 cents to $19.21 an ounce. Copper gained 2 cents to $2.21 a pound. The dollar rose to 101.41 yen from 101.07 yen. The euro rose to $1.1237 from $1.1216. Germany’s DAX climbed 1 percent and France’s CAC 40 added 0.1 percent. The FTSE 100 in Britain lost 0.3 percent. Major indexes in Asia slumped on concerns about the banking industry. Japan’s Nikkei 225 slumped 1.5 percent and South Korea’s Kospi fell 1.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index sank 1.9 percent. ——— AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay     Tags: percent, cents, deutsche, stocks, investors, friday, Other stories from today: Volkswagen reaches $1.2B settlement with dealers in scandal SpaceX’s Elon Musk turns to science fiction for Mars ship A year of Alphabet: Great for Google, less so for moonshots     Print this Page  |  << Back   Return To Archives            Daily Journal Quick Poll   Now that commercial crab season is open, do you plan to buy some?

This was the first of a series of events planned under a USPWC supply chain diversity initiative that aims to help women owned businesses access sustainable markets by linking them with corporate procurement representatives. The next event will be hosted by the Wecreate Pakistan resource center for women entrepreneurs in Islamabad. Women entrepreneurs attending the event included those who received training at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) through the U.S. Embassy-supported Pakistan Women Entrepreneur Program (PWEP) managed in partnership with American University, as well as women from the World Bank’s Women entrepreneurship training program conducted in partnership with Enclude at Government College University. USPWC member companies PepsiCo and Procter & Gamble joined locally-based companies Bulleshah Paper Mills, Dinnipon Inks and Packages Limited in presenting on how women entrepreneurs may enter corporate supply chains. For example, while women owned businesses in fields such as promotion and advertising already do supply large corporations; women-run businesses of all sizes can provide printing services, janitorial services, canteen and food services, day care services, or innovative corporate gifts and stationery.

In Sri Lanka to commence the initiative and run some of Interbrand’s most respected processes – including Brand Strength and Role of Brand – is Ashish Mishra, Managing Director, Interbrand India, and his senior strategy and client team. Sri Lankan brand consultancy Michel Nugawela Designs will partner Interbrand for the duration of the programme and leverage its brand engagement processes that drive high performance brand cultures. Established in 1974 and an opinion leader in the field of value-based brand management, Interbrand was the first brand consultancy to recognize the significance of a brand as a business asset and introduce the brand valuation concept. With a network of over 33 offices in 27 countries, Interbrand’s combination of rigorous strategy, analytics, and world-class design enables it to assist clients in creating and managing brand value effectively, across all touchpoints, in all market dynamics. Its annual Best Global Brands report, the definitive guide to the world’s 100 most valuable brands and now in its 17th year, valuates each brand’s financial performance, role, and strength through a five-step Economic Value Added methodology which is also the first of its kind to be ISO certified. Interbrand recently launched the inaugural Interbrand Breakthrough Brands report, in partnership with Facebook, Ready Set Rocket, and the New York Stock Exchange. The report is unique in that it examines emerging companies that are brand-led – organizations that have both unique business models and strong brands. The report complements Interbrand’s Best Global Brands report by putting a spotlight on emerging brands – especially those that are affecting change and embodying growth. Interbrand’s portfolio of services include research and analytics to gain deep understanding of unmet needs and opportunities related to brands, customers or markets; strategy that defines the purpose, identity, and role of brands to create differentiation and value for businesses; the creation and integration of products, services, behaviours, communications, and environments that build holistic experiences that connect people and brands in unique ways; and strategic planning, technology platforms, and internal engagement that bring a brand experience to market and strengthen internal marketing and brand management capabilities. Interbrand’s impressive portfolio of clients include brand leaders in every industry, category and segment including HSBC, American Express, Credit Suisse, Barclays, Swiss Re, Allstate, and Bank of America in financial services; GE, Shell, IBM, KPMG and Godrej in diversified sectors; FedEx, UPS, DHL, British Airways, KLM, Thai, Iberia, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and Maersk in logistics and transportation; Unilever, P&G, Nestle, Kraft, Nivea, Knorr and Wrigley in CPG/FMCG; FIFA, Rugby Football Union, Ryder Cup, USGA and Sochi Olympics in sport branding; Gucci, Prada, Rolls Royce, Cartier, Piaget, Hugo Boss, Bulgari and Remy Martin in the luxury segment; as well as cities, regions and nations such as Edinburgh, Johannesburg, Monitoba, South Korea, Holland and Chile. Interbrand also created the first Korean Top 100 brand, Samsung, by introducing the brand value concept to the conglomerate and propelling it to the 7th most valuable brand ranking in the Best Global Brands table, worth over $45bn in 2015.    Hits: 210     Send to Friend               Breaking News Await Breaking News Last Updated Nov 17 2016 | 09:18 pm ...   Featured News Microsoft defines technological... 2016-11-17 Read More   Learning Medicine from Maneka... 2016-11-17 Read More   Mahinda urged to take over SLPF 2016-11-17 Read More   The Island 35 Anniversary 2016-11-18 Read More         ARCHIVES RELATED LINKS Friday, 18th November 2016 [Current Issue] Thursday, 17th November 2016 Wednesday, 16th November 2016 Tuesday, 15th November 2016 Monday, 14th November 2016 Sunday, 13th November 2016 More Archives World Clock Currency Rates Weather     UPALI NEWSPAPERS (PVT) LTD Copyright © Upali Newspapers (Pvt) Ltd.
