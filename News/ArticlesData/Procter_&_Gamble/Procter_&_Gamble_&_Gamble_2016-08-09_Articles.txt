Targeted Ads Procter & Gamble announced yesterday the company has decided to scale back on their targeted Facebook advertisements, citing limited effectiveness. The world's largest ad buyer will not cut back on the overall funding for Facebook advertisements, but instead will reduce the number of targeted ad buys. “We targeted too much, and we went too narrow,” Marc Pritchard, chief financial officer at P&G, said to The Wall Street Journal, “and now we're looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?” “Facebook has been one of our first and most consistent partners,” a spokesperson at P&G said to DMN. “Facebook offers both mass reach with precision targeting and our brands will continue to use Facebook to reach consumer, including targeting where it makes sense.” However, this scale back in advertisement should not be perceived as a failure by either company, according to Joshua Backer, Co-Founder and President of Advertising at Unified. “P&G did what a smart marketer should do: test and learn based on results,” said Backer to DMN. “Highly segmented targeting on all campaigned and investments was a sound hypothesis, but the data did not support hyper-segmentation across the board.” Facebook's ad platform has evolved over time, offering advertisers more opportunity to get granular in who they reach and track the efficacy of their ads. Key milestones include interest targeting (launched in 2007) and its partnership with Datalogix, which helped advertisers track whether ads led to offline purchases (launched in 2012). “Our partnership with P&G grows every year in service of effect and efficient advertising,” a Facebook spokeswoman said to DMN. “We learn from each other and iterate. That has always been the spirit of how we work together and challenge one another.” P&G also said that it would cut back on spending on publisher websites, citing a lack of reach in comparison to the social media behemoth. Facebook had an average of 1.13 billion daily active users and 1.71 monthly active users in June, according to the company's website. This shift underscores the uneasy relationship between Facebook and publishers, who depend on Facebook's referral of free traffic while the company courts ad revenue from legacy advertisers like P&G. In 2012, General Motors announced that it would stop advertising on Facebook, citing poor performance. The news resulted in a slight dip in Facebook's stock as it was the first time a major brand publicly questioned the value of Facebook advertising. The company returned the next year. The timing of P&G's announcement cannot be ignored though, as the same day Facebook revealed plans to launch a digital program that will render the functionality of ad blockers useless. “We've designed our ad formats, ad performance and controls to address the underlying reasons people to ad blocking software,” said a Facebook press release. “Rather than paying ad blocking companies to unblock the ads we show - as some of the companies have invited us to do in the past - we're putting the control in people's hands with our updated ad preferences and our other advertising controls.” This program will also create more online ad space for Facebook, which pulled in $17.08 billion in ad revenue last year.

By DC Velocity Staff Comment Managing a team of more than 60,000 supply chain employees for the Illinois-based, global food and beverage conglomerate Mondelēz International might seem like an intimidating job. For Daniel Myers, however, the position is a logical next step in a long and distinguished career. Prior to his current position, he led business units at Procter & Gamble Co. (P&G) for 33 years. He's also worked in more than four dozen countries ... so far. His accomplishments include integrating Gillette's global supply chain after it was acquired by P&G in 2005 and helping to create an efficient, snack-focused supply chain at Mondelēz when Kraft Foods Inc. created the company by spinning off its North American grocery operations in 2012. As executive vice president for integrated supply chain, Myers has earned a reputation for developing the next generation of supply chain professionals and managers. Myers received his Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering from the University of Tennessee and serves on the board of the Global Supply Chain Institute at the university's Haslam College of Business. For this profile, Myers answered seven questions about his life experiences and lessons learned from four decades of leadership in the global supply chain. Q: What's your proudest professional achievement, and why? A: I've had the blessing and privilege to do so much in my career, but the greatest thing is to get a group of people to do the extraordinary together and achieve what they did not think was possible. [For example,] we are currently reinventing the entire supply chain for our company, for every region and every category. We have committed to save $3 billion in gross savings over two years—$1.5 billion net—taken out of COGS (the cost of goods sold). Q: You've worked for decades in logistics and supply chain at Procter & Gamble, Kraft, and now Mondelēz International. What first drew you to this profession? A: I started in engineering, then moved to manufacturing, customer service, and procurement, so I've been exposed to different functions in the value chain. That continuous flow of getting products into consumers' hands is what makes a business succeed or fail. I have worked in 49 countries around the world now; it's exciting. Q: What are some of the biggest changes you've seen during your career? A: I have seen us move in the industry from a siloed [view] to sharing information. We call my division the "integrated supply chain" because breaking down divisions is the secret to business success. We've got to be consumer-driven and optimize the total value chain to succeed, moving from silos to a focus on common metrics. The Information Age allows you to do that. Q: What hasn't changed? A: The focus on having leaders of integrity who can build trust and "followership." You can sense when you have a great leader because people want to be there. That's true for all generations; Millennials want to work for something greater than money—they want to work for something they're proud of. Q: What are some of the truisms that should be forgotten? In other words, what rules do companies need to break? A: Each of us has the tendency to look at ourselves in the mirror, but when you look through the window first, at whoever is best in the world, then [your own] reflection looks different. We looked at who is best in safety, and that was DuPont. They're not in the food business, but they had the best standard, so we aimed for that. And we would not have dropped our injury rate by threefold if we had just continued to improve by our own measure. Maybe that comparison will make you uncomfortable, but it creates a level of dissatisfaction, and your rate of improvement is directly proportional to your level of dissatisfaction. Q: You are known for nurturing and developing supply chain leadership.What advice would you give someone just starting a career in supply chain management? A: No one's going to remember what you do in your own career. What people remember is what you're done to nurture their growth and development. Learning agility—the ability to learn and grow over your lifetime—is really what sets apart people who make a difference. As you learn you develop mastery, then you can pass that knowledge on to others. Q: What attributes do you look for when recruiting someone to your team? A: Integrity. Personal drive to be the best. Learning agility. Capacity. Raw talent. Intelligence. Capability. #Professional Development #Supply Chain Management #Logistics Resources Mentioned In This Article Mondelez International Procter & Gamble University of Tennessee Related Articles Survey: Consumers demand blend of online and in-store shopping options Shopify integrates with Shyp for outsourced fulfillment Bennett International launches transportation logistics firm Logistics gives back NRF sweeps into NYC on Jan. 15 More Videos » Strategy Videos MHI – now and in the future.

But maybe there is a downside to such microtargeting. P&G CMO Marc Pritchard told the WSJ:  “We targeted too much, and we went too narrow,” he said in an interview, “and now we're looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?” It's hard to not read this as a failure of Facebook advertising account management - that team should be the one guiding large advertisers like P&G through the right mix. But, separately, maybe a CPG like P&G has done mass marketing for a reason. No amount of social media posts are going to alert any company when someone is in the market for dish detergent. Here's Facebook's statement to DMN: "Our partnership with P&G grows every year in service of effective and efficient advertising. We learn from each other and iterate. That has always been the spirit of how we work together and challenge one another. The cornerstone of our ad strategy is a mix of mass reach and personalized targeting that lends well to mobile consumption and is a strong complement to TV. Our clients tell us this strategy works because we can deliver relevant marketing to the right audiences, with unprecedented scale. It enables partners like P&G to drive the business metrics they care about.” * This blog post previously implied P&G was cutting back on Facebook advertising. It is scaling back targeted advertising but planning to keep its overall spend the same. DMNotes is DMN's around-the-clock blog. Yes, a blog in 2016.

The Cincinnati-based consumer goods company said it will scale back its targeted ads on Facebook. Considered the biggest advertising spender in the world, P&G said the targeted ads were producing limited revenue for the company. P&G still plans to maintain advertisements on Facebook, but it will use targeted ads only where it makes sense. The company has recently increased spending on both websites and traditional platforms. P&G spent about $8.3 billion on global advertising this year, down eight percent year-over-year. The company plans to increase its advertising spending by five percent for the year that started on July 1.

Procter & Gamble also comes in above the median of analyst picks among the broader S&P 500 index components, claiming the #204 spot out of 500. In forming this rank, the analyst opinions from the major brokerage houses were tallied, and averaged; then, the underlying components were ranked according to those averages. Investors often interpret analyst opinions from different angles — a popular analyst pick could mean that many sharp minds individually came to the same bullish conclusion, and therefore the stock should do well, but it could also mean that if the company stumbles, that would come as a negative surprise.

It can, of course, but a bullish investor could also take the contrarian angle and read into the data that there is lots of room for upside because the stock is so out of favor. 9 Stocks to Buy That Will Sprint Past Everything Else For these reasons, we at ETF Channel find value to putting together these rankings, because both the top and the bottom ends of the lists can often make for some interesting stock picking ideas for further research.

August 10, 2016 8:51am Nasdaq:FB NYSE:PG ShareTweet Consumer products giant Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) recently said it would spend less money on targeted ads on Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB), citing limited effectiveness of the campaigns. Now investors are scrambling to determine whether the move is a sign that Facebook’s explosive ad revenues are topping, or if P&G’s decision is simply a one-off event that the social media giant will take in stride. From the Wall Street Journal: Procter & Gamble Co., the biggest advertising spender in the world, will move away from ads on Facebook that target specific consumers, concluding that the practice has limited effectiveness. Facebook Inc. has spent years developing its ability to zero in on consumers based on demographics, shopping habits and life milestones. P&G, the maker of myriad household goods including Tide and Pampers, initially jumped at the opportunity to market directly to subsets of shoppers, from teenage shavers to first-time homeowners. Marc Pritchard, P&G’s chief marketing officer, said the company has realized it took the strategy too far. “We targeted too much, and we went too narrow,” he said in an interview, “and now we’re looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?” While P&G isn’t actually spending less money on Facebook’s platform, targeted ads usually cost significantly more money than wider-reaching ads. Thus, FB will likely be getting a lower amount per ad from the world’s largest advertiser. Procter & Gamble’s brands include household names like Tide detergent, Bounty paper towels, Pampers diapers, and many more. If other big companies begin to follow P&G’s lead, Facebook’s targeted ads — which have been a cornerstone of its meteoric revenue growth — could face significant pressure. That would mean a leveling off or perhaps even a decline in revenue per page. Plenty of other advertisers will continue to use Facebook’s targeting out of necessity — think local political ads, car dealerships, etc. But it may be that national brands just don’t see the returns from targeting specific user types than originally hoped. While P&G pulls back on targeting, companies like Priceline and others are actually ramping up. Their results in doing so help determine the fate of Facebook’s ad platform at large. Facebook shares were mostly flat in premarket trading Wednesday at $125.03. FB has gained 19.5% year-to-date, more than doubling the performance of the S&P 500 index in the same period.

O Facebook passou anos aprimorando sua capacidade de selecionar consumidores em sua rede social baseado em fatores demográficos, hábitos de compra e acontecimentos marcantes na vida dos usuários. A P&G, fabricante do detergente Tide e das fraldas Pampers, incialmente abraçou a oportunidade de direcionar seus anúncios para grupos particulares, desde mulheres grávidas até proprietários do primeiro imóvel. Marc Pritchard, diretor de marketing da P&G, diz que a empresa americana concluiu que a estratégia foi longe demais. “Miramos demais e afunilamos demais”, disse ele numa entrevista ao The Wall Street Journal, “e agora estamos perguntando: Qual a melhor maneira de ter o maior alcance, mas também a precisão correta?” Pritchard diz que a P&G não vai cortar seus gastos no Facebook e vai continuar usando publicidade direcionada quando fizer sentido, como anunciar fraldas para grávidas. Ele diz que a empresa aumentou seus gastos tanto na internet como em plataformas mais tradicionais. A empresa, porém, reduziu a publicidade em sites menores, que não têm o alcance de gigantes como Facebook, Google e YouTube. De forma mais geral, a mudança promovida pela P&G ressalta os limites da publicidade direcionada de grandes marcas, um dos pilares do negócio do Facebook. Dois anos atrás, por exemplo, a P&G tentou direcionar os anúncios de seu spray aromatizante Frebreze para donos de animais de estimação e famílias numerosas. As vendas da marca ficaram estagnadas durante a campanha, mas aumentaram a partir de março, quando ela foi expandida no Facebook e outros veículos para qualquer pessoa com mais de 18 anos. Uma porta-voz do Facebook diz que a parceria da rede social com a P&G “fica maior a cada ano” e que as duas empresas aprendem uma com a outra. O Facebook começou a trabalhar num sistema de publicidade direcionada em 2007, quando ainda era uma “startup” deficitária de três anos de idade e sua rede social tinha só 60 milhões de usuários ativos. Na época, a principal plataforma de marketing do Facebook eram páginas gratuitas onde as empresas promoviam seus produtos. Desde então, o Facebook se tornou uma plataforma de marketing de dimensões notáveis. No ano passado, a empresa americana faturou US$ 17,08 bilhões com publicidade, 49% a mais que em 2014, aproveitando o desejo dos anunciantes de alcançar os seus agora 1,7 bilhão de usuários ativos mensais. No Facebook, os anunciantes podem selecionar o alvo de suas propagandas com precisão. Políticos disputando eleições, por exemplo, podem se focar nos eleitores de seu distrito, redes de restaurantes podem promover campanhas para os amantes de comidas apimentadas e empresas de mudança podem encontrar internautas que “muito provavelmente” vão se mudar. “Se você pode publicar um anúncio e atingir um milhão de pessoas ou direcionar outro só para 5 mil, você tem que ter um retorno expressivo no de 5 mil para que ele valha a pena”, diz Peter Daboll, diretor-presidente da Ace Metrix, firma que mede a eficácia de anúncios e trabalha com o Facebook. A P&G, que é sediada em Cincinnati, no Estado americano de Ohio, gastou aproximadamente US$ 8,3 bilhões com publicidade no mundo todo durante o ano fiscal encerrado em junho de 2015, 8% menos que no ano anterior, segundo documentos públicos da empresa. A P&G afirma que elevou os gastos com publicidade em 1% no seu ano fiscal recém-terminado e que pretende aumentá-los em cerca de 5% no ano corrente, iniciado em 1º de julho. O esforço da P&G para encontrar uma audiência mais ampla para seus anúncios também fica evidente nos aumentos recentes que a empresa fez em seus gastos com propagandas na televisão, dizem pessoas a par do assunto. Próximo do fim do ano passado, a empresa começou a transferir uma fatia maior do orçamento de volta para a televisão, dizem as fontes. Durante o primeiro trimestre deste ano, os gastos com anúncios saltaram 11% em relação ao mesmo período de 2015, para US$ 429 milhões, afirma a Kantar Media, que monitora gastos com publicidade das empresas. Para muitos dos maiores anunciantes do mundo, as ferramentas de publicidade direcionada oferecidas pelo Facebook não são tão atraentes assim, diz Brian Weiser, analista da firma de pesquisa Pivotal Research. “Quanto maior a sua marca, mais você precisa de um alcance maior e menos de mídia direcionada”, diz ele. Propaganda para grupos específicos é vital, por exemplo, para anunciantes tentando convencer usuários a baixar um aplicativo de videogame ou para pequenas empresas tentando atrair clientes locais. O Facebook começou a oferecer novas ferramentas especificamente para grandes anunciantes, inclusive uma maneira de aumentar a exposição da marca ao mostrar anúncios para pessoas mais propensas a prestar atenção neles. O ponto principal da estratégia de publicidade do Facebook é uma mistura de alcance de massa e personalização, o que é adequado ao consumo via aparelhos móveis e é um forte complemento para a TV, diz a porta-voz do Facebook. E nem todos os grandes anunciantes estão reduzindo sua publicidade direcionada no Facebook. A empresa de viagens Priceline Group Inc., por exemplo, planeja elevar seus gastos com esse tipo de anúncios. “Concluímos que algumas coisas que fizemos no Facebook funcionaram bem”, diz o diretor-presidente Jeffrey Boyd.

Facebook will, however, continue to deliver ad content to its users as it bypasses ad blockers on desktop.  ( Carl Court | Getty Images ) Advertisement For a well-known company such as Procter & Gamble, the world's biggest ad spender, going for Facebook's targeted ads just might not be the most effective advertising strategy. P&G will veer away from niche marketing on the social media platform after realizing it "went too narrow" but didn't prove as effective as the company had hoped. "Now we're looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?" Marc Pritchard, chief marketing officer of P&G, tells the Wall Street Journal. Bigger Brands, Broader Reach The biggest selling point of Facebook marketing is, of course, the company's ability to drill down into unique user demographics and psychographics, and serve advertisers the exact commodity audience it is looking for, whether the subjects be working moms on the East Coast, animé enthusiasts in Brazil or chocolate lovers in Osaka. Cornering a niche market might work for a local brand targeting a specific community. But, for a well-established name like P&G, the right strategy might still be in casting the net far and wide and going for more traditional advertising platforms such as television. "The bigger your brand," says Brian Weiser, an analyst for Pivotal Research, "the more you need broad reach and less targeted media." To be clear, P&G will not altogether slash its budget for Facebook ads in general, but it will make use of targeting only where it seems logical to, the WSJ reports. The company recognizes that its recent ad strategy just "targeted too much" of the niche markets, but connecting with audiences on digital platforms will remain an integral part of the company's marketing plans. Back To TV Commercials P&G also aims to boost its advertising budget by 5 percent, after shelling out about $7.2 billion last year, but beginning in late 2015, it has reportedly redirected much of its budget to TV commercials. One Facebook spokeswoman points out that the social media platform enjoys growth from its partnership with P&G each year and that "the cornerstone of [Facebook's] ad strategy is a mix of mass reach and personalized targeting." This unique approach, Facebook believes, provides a "strong complement to TV" in a mobile-first age. Facebook Bypasses Ad Blockers The social media site is also constantly looking for ways to deliver ad content to its massive base of 1.7 billion users. Just this week, for instance, the company tweaked its technology to bypass ad blockers on desktop. Even as P&G pulls back on targeting, Facebook's revenue from advertising as a whole continues to grow significantly, increasing by almost 50 percent, to pull in more than $17 billion last year. With a user base of more than one billion and counting, all other advertisers may be scrambling to get a slice of that market.

How many times have girls quit sports around us without receiving the encouragement to continue? With nearly 7 out of 10 girls feeling they do not belong in sports, it's no wonder half of girls quit sports by the end of puberty. Always is partnering with UN Women and IOC globally to change that, because sports keep girls confident. "Earlier this summer, Always® embarked on a new chapter in its mission to stop the drop in confidence girls experience at puberty by encouraging all girls to stay in sports and Keep Playing #LikeAGirl. Sports are such an important confidence-builder, yet too many girls lack the encouragement, resources and even access that will keep them playing," said Michele Baeten, Always Associate Director, Procter & Gamble. "We're so excited to create meaningful partnerships that make a real difference to keep more girls in sports, and drive awareness on the important role that sports play in building girls' confidence." Partnership efforts kicked off on Saturday in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil where Always committed its support to the UN Women & International Olympic Committee (IOC) initiative "One Win Leads to Another," that will help 2,500 local Brazilian girls, aged 10-18 years, gain access to sports and confidence-building curriculum as part of a six-month pilot program. These three organizations are coming together to achieve their shared goal to invest in girls' skills and training to support a generation of stronger, more confident and empowered women. The curriculum leveraged in this program, developed by UN Women's partner Women Win and adapted for the Olympic legacy programme in Brazil, has proven to drastically improve girls' confidence and understanding of sexual health and rights, finances and economic empowerment: 89% of girls say they are a leader, compared to 46% before the programme; 68% of girls have increased knowledge and understanding of gender-based violence and 93% of them know where to report violence; Nearly 80% of girls have an increased understanding of their sexual and reproductive health and rights; and know how to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections. This announcement is part of the Always brand's commitment to encourage girls to stay in sport and Keep Playing #LikeAGirl. All over the world we are partnering with local organizations, coaches and teachers and providing them with simple, ready to use communication tools and information to encourage girls to Keep Playing #LikeAGirl. In Canada, Always is proud to announce a national partnership with the Canadian Women's Foundation. This partnership will help to stop the drop in girls' confidence by supporting programs in communities across Canada for girls, aged nine to 13 that engage their bodies, minds, and spirits. These programs encourage girls to participate in sports and physical activity, explore science and technology, develop critical thinking skills and take on leadership in a supportive all-girl environment. Among girls who have participated in Canadian Women's Foundation-funded programs over the past three years, 92% reported feeling more confident, 96% reported feeling better about being a girl, and 88% reported having new strengths or skills. "Girls are routinely exposed to stereotypes that erode their confidence and embed self-limiting beliefs," says Beth Malcolm, Director of the Girls' Fund at the Canadian Women's Foundation. "The Always #LikeAGirl campaign is a natural fit with our work, and this partnership is a deep acknowledgement of the powerful role that sports and physical activity can play in stopping the drop in girls' confidence. Always' support will help us to continue this important work of empowering girls to defy stereotypes." Many studies have found that ongoing participation in sports and physical activity is a high contributor to confidence in girls, and provides valuable skills to help them stay confident to do any and every thing later in life. In fact, a recent consumer study showed that women ages 18 to 24 are twice as likely to be confident if they play sports regularly, compared to those who do not play at all. Additionally, the recent Always Confidence & Puberty Survey found that girls reported that three of the top benefits of staying in sports are increased confidence, teamwork, and leadership skills. About Always #LikeAGirl The Always #LikeAGirl movement is being fueled by the millions of girls around the world who are changing #LikeAGirl to mean amazing things. The Always #LikeAGirl campaign launched in June 2014 was inspired by the insight that the start of puberty and the first period mark the lowest moment in confidence for girls and how harmful words can add to that drop in confidence. It demonstrated the profound effect the phrase "like a girl" can have on girls' self-confidence and it inspired a movement, which has started to change public perception: after seeing the #LikeAGirl video, most people (76 percent of women ages 16 to 24 and 59 percent of men) said the video changed their perception of the phrase "like a girl,"*** according to the Always Puberty & Confidence Wave II Study. But it could not stop there. In 2015, a new Always study revealed that 72 percent of girls feel society limits them by telling them what they should and should not do or be. And more than half of girls felt that societal limitations would be the same or worse ten years from now, showing a lack of hope for change. Always could not accept that and launched the Unstoppable #LikeAGirl campaign to empower all girls to show the world that they could do or be anything and everything. In March 2016, the brand tackled the subtle bias conveyed through emojis, and the resulting conversation can be credited in part for a proposal to UNICODE Consortium that has yielded more female options. In June 2016, the brand released new survey data which finds that half of girls quit sports by age 17 and that seven in ten girls do not feel encouraged to play, despite data that links sports participation to increased confidence. To help keep girls in sports, Always launched the new Always #LikeAGirl - Keep Playing initiative, now in progress. For more information about the #LikeAGirl movement, visit www.always.com.

Bachelder, has built her career on being a different sort of leader. In early June 2016 Bachelder discussed her views on leadership, business, faith and more with Religion & Liberty’s Sarah Stanley at the Popeyes’ headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. Bachelder has a long list of accomplishments. She’s currently the CEO of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, which she joined in November 2007 after serving as an active member of the company’s board for a year. At Popeyes, she promptly established a “Road Map for Results that focused on four key tenets of growing a restaurant chain: build a distinctive brand, run great restaurants, grow restaurant profits and ramp up new unit growth.” Before joining Popeyes, Bachelder was president and chief concept officer for KFC Corporate, and before that she served as vice president of marketing and product development for Domino’s Pizza. Prior to her restaurant experience, Bachelder served as general manager of the LifeSavers Division of RJR Nabisco. Her early career years included brand management roles at Gillett and Procter & Gamble. She is the author of Dare to Serve: How to Drive Superior Results by Serving Others (Berrett-Koehler 2015). Bachelder holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration and a Master of Business Administration in Finance and Marketing from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University. R&L: When you took over the helm of the troubled Popeyes organization, you worked hard to restore trust with franchisees, many of whom felt that they’d been let down by the company. How did you begin that process? Cheryl A. Bachelder: Well, the company is 35 years old. So it’s been here a long time. A franchisee signs a 20-year contract to represent our brand, so it’s a very long-view investment for them and for their families. In the seven years prior to my arrival, they had met four different CEOs. There had been a lot of turnover in the role. And I was just another one. Their first look at me was, “Well, what’s so great about you?” It so quickly became evident that I had a lot of work to do to restore any kind of trust and credibility with them that would allow me to lead. Trust always begins by one thing: listening. One of the other execs and I went on a seven-city listening tour. We had small group meetings with our franchise owners, our restaurant general managers and our customers. And we just took notes. It took us about three weeks to get to all seven cities and absorb all the feedback. But I think that’s the key—to not assume you know. And also that you never forget that the people closest to the business actually do know what’s going on. It’s a way to demonstrate respect, that their input’s valuable, and they do have some ideas they’d like to share about how to turn the business around. So we collected all that input and those ideas, and that’s where we began to form a thesis about our business plan, where we should put our attention, what needed to change in what order. We created the Roadmap for Results, a one-page summary of the goals and strategies we would pursue to turn the company around. But we didn’t just start doing it. We went back on the road and did town hall meetings in multiple cities to give people a chance to look at our thinking and to test it and say, “Does that ring true? Is that what you were trying to tell us? Is that a plan you could be excited about?” In your book, Dare to Serve: How to Create Superior Results by Serving Others, you talk a lot about solving problems and managing with a fact-based approach. It’s been said that not everything one measures is important and not everything important can be measured. Do metrics have a limit to their usefulness in managing a large corporation? I suppose you can measure too much and confuse the organization by having so many measures that nobody knows what’s important. But in our company we’ve typically focused on four to six measures. We evaluate all of our restaurants and our company performance on the same measures year after year. And now people understand that if we do those things well, they deliver sustained performance. And so they’ve become real guideposts. We just set new bold goals for our investors, and we announced that at our last investor call earlier this year. We said, “It’s time to stretch again and go farther faster.” We have a saying that one of our operations team members created that says you move what you measure. And we haven’t found a way to improve ourselves without a measure. It’s a marker. It’s feedback. It tells you whether you’re going forward or going backwards. And so we are incredibly focused on measuring the things we think are important to move. With a lot of political momentum behind the push for minimum wage hikes, which is happening in Seattle right now, for example, how will Popeyes cope with these mandated costs? How much can be automated? Well, you’re right that the cost of wages is probably the single pressing issue on a restaurant operator today. And people forget that restaurant operators typically own four or five restaurants and live in a small town. These are not big corporations. People also think that restaurants make a ton of money. They don’t. The average restaurant in our business has sales between a million two and a million four. And they make less than 10 percent after tax profit. So then $120,000 to $140,000 a year. Or $10,000 a month. That is not a lot of money. The total wages we pay in an average restaurant are $350,000, more than double the profit for the restaurant. So what people forget is that economics is an ecosystem. I believe we should pay fair wages. I also believe we should charge fair prices to our guests. And I also believe a small business person has a right to fair profits. Now interestingly, in a policy talk, if we decided to double our prices overnight, there’d be a bit of a problem in the media. Or if our franchise owner said, “I think it’s my right to make twice as much money,” there’d be a little bit of a problem in the media. But we think it’s just fine to double wages overnight? The ecosystem won’t work. There isn’t enough money to make that work. The only levers in a profit and loss statement are to raise your prices or cut your cost. It’s very simple math. And so what we will see, if wages move too rapidly, we move from $7.25 to $15, which has already happened in several cities, prices will go up very fast for guests, hours will come down for the employees, because we will find a way to do it with less. We have to. We will have to seek automation. There will be no option. We’ll just eliminate the need to have people talk to you. And then, finally otherwise, if it only comes out of the profits, there will be no restaurants. And if you read the follow-up on Seattle, for example, the restaurants have left the city limits of Seattle because they can’t make a fair profit. Does Popeyes operate in Seattle? We do. In the suburbs. Our franchisee operates near Seattle. And not only does he have wage challenges, but he also has beverage taxes, sick day policies. The amount of regulation in the West Coast states is almost defeating to an entrepreneur. In fact, some restaurant companies have decided to retreat from West Coast states. These things are really making it difficult for entrepreneurs to make a living, a fair living, for their families, to put their kids through college. And what people forget in the restaurant business, in Popeyes, 41 percent of our owners are immigrants to this country who came here to pursue the American Dream. They are some of the most hardworking, cool people you’ve ever met. And all they want to do is get a nice little apartment for their family and put their kids through college, things that all of us take for granted. I often say that entrepreneurs are not being defended in today’s policy conversations because they’re too busy working. And what we need is a millionperson march on Washington, the hardworking entrepreneurs who really are the backbone of our country, of economic growth and of this thing that we’ve always held dear—the American Dream. Focusing on this idea of the “American Dream,” you say in your book that “democratic capitalism creates conditions for entrepreneurs to invest and grow small businesses.” Do you think the hope for that American Dream has become more difficult today? Yes. I’ll give you one specific example of how it’s more difficult. Today, because the economics are not as strong in the business, it is harder to borrow money to start a business. And therefore, the banks are only lending money to larger businesses. And so you’re seeing in the restaurant industry, the mom-and-pop businesses are declining. The small chain operators are becoming big and the opportunity for that one-restaurant person has declined materially—and with that, the opportunity for that onerestaurant person to become a hundredrestaurant owner. We have people in Popeyes who started as a fry cook in an inner-city restaurant in Chicago and are multimillionaires today because they own 50, 60 restaurants. The opportunities are huge in this business. And you don’t have to have an MBA. And you don’t have to have a ton of money to get in. You have to have a work ethic and a passion for putting together a good team and taking care of your customers. Why would we want to discourage that? That’s why we work at this task. Try to influence it. You worked for Tom Monaghan for years at Domino’s Pizza. You credit him for instilling in you a zeal for operational excellence and an emphasis on character. Could you describe some of the character lessons you learned there? Well, the first thing I learned from him was how you run a restaurant company, which was huge. I’d never worked for a restaurant company before. And Tom had literally started the first Domino’s with $200 and a Volkswagen in Ann Arbor, Michigan. When I was there they had 5,000 or 6,000 restaurants. So he was a phenomenal restaurant operator and created a model that’s gone to take on the world, with over 9,000 stores today. The reason I went to work for Tom is that I really wanted to work for a man whose character was an important part of his convictions about how he led. And I met Tom in his life, after he’d sold off a lot of businesses and rabbit trails that he’d gone on in his life, and he was very focused on Domino’s, and he was very focused on charitable work. I got to watch up close how his character and his values impacted the company. And I got to watch up close how he, the man, was living his life at the age of 60 or so at the time. I then got to watch him sell the company and make a big announcement. The headline of the Detroit paper was, “I’m Going to Die Broke,” because he had a plan to give it all away between that day and the end of his life. And he’s doing that today. He talked a lot about the Golden Rule. And I don’t think I even realized how deeply imbedded that’s become in my leadership thinking. But it actually is one of the central ideas that you hear me talk about when I write about the turnaround of this company, because a huge part of leadership is being the leader you wished you worked for. I find lots of people tell me that they want to be a great leader. And I ask them, “Describe a great leader that you’ve worked for.” And they quickly tell me all the traits of that leader. And I say, “Are you being that leader to the people that work for you?” And there’s always a long pause. As in small things, we struggle to hold ourselves accountable to the Golden Rule in leadership as well. We struggle to be the leaders that we would want to work for ourselves. And it’s become a very provocative theme that I discuss with my leaders all the time. You know, they’ll come in upset about the performance of an individual. And I’ll say to them, “Well, how would you want to be treated in this circumstance? What conversation would you want your boss to have with you right now? Where would you like them to start?” Because it flips the frame around. And it makes the leader far more accountable for their actions than just to lash out at the person they’re upset with because of their performance. And I always say, “Look first at yourself and then to the other person. Look first at your behaviors, your actions, before you criticize the next,” but, boy, that’s hard to do. None of us are good at it. Your book, Dare to Serve, offers a path for corporate leadership that we don’t get often enough. What we usually get is the Hollywood stereotype of the greedy, selfish Wolf of Wall Street character who tramples down everyone in his way. Which of these two paths do you see more of in corporate leadership? The leadership approach of our culture is what Robert Greenleaf called “Leader First.” And too often that means that the power of the position assumed by the leader is used to accomplish the leader’s ambitions. And if it, by chance, serves the people in the enterprise, well, great. But the primary motive of a leader-first leader is his or herself. It’s the leadership model we teach, reward and celebrate in our culture. It’s on our magazine covers. It’s in our business schools. It’s in our universities. It’s in our homes. Greenleaf said at the other end of the spectrum is a leader who serves first. And he said this over 40 years ago. And he was not an academic or a consultant. He was kind of a Dilbert. He was in middle management at a large corporation called AT&T, just observing human behavior. He said there’s this other idea where you could be serving first. You would understand you have power (because leadership does come with power), but you would understand that you would use that power for the benefit of those that have been entrusted to your care. Very novel idea. And interestingly, he’s looked at as kind of an interesting essay writer from a long time ago. He’s the one who coined “servant leadership” as a phrase in the secular business world. But his ideas have not taken hold. Interestingly, other people have tried to make them more mainstream. The book Good to Great by Jim Collins is a seminal business book. It’s all about servant leadership. He calls it level 5 leadership. But it basically proves that humble, courageous leaders deliver the best financial performance. He decided not to call them servant leaders because it wasn’t a popular term. So he called them level 5 leaders. Then another guy recently, Adam Grant, the youngest tenured professor at Wharton, wrote Give and Take. It’s another book just like the first which says these people who think of others first or give more than they take actually outperform the rest. So it’s been documented. There’s another one called Firms of Endearment. So there are three major research-based, documented reports that companies that led in this fashion outperform the S&P 500 and their peers competitively. So why not more? It’s really countercultural. It’s so hard for people to even comprehend— after they’ve been raised up through team sports to be winners, through college to be ambitious, through jobs—how we promote ourselves and become the top dog in a company. All of that is aimed at self-development, with little regard for anybody else. This is deep-rooted in our culture. And the reason I wanted to write about it is I wanted to be a provocative voice of how you might actually do this, because I’m not an academic or a consultant either—I’m a doer. And there hadn’t been a doer book written since Bill Pollard wrote about ServiceMaster more than 30 years ago. And Max De Pree wrote about Herman Miller, the furniture company in Michigan. Those are the last two people that wrote about doing it. So my hope is that we can rejuvenate the conversation. But in our culture it’s going to have to be about performance, because that’s all we care about. If we did not have results, no one would be listening to this story or reading this book. It has to yield results to capture the attention of our culture. And that’s what we’ve set out to kind of prove here, “Hey, take a look at this. It’s counterculture.” You’re very open about your faith. Is that ever a problem as the leader of a major public company? Is there a certain mode in which the faith expresses itself—words or deeds? I believe strong leaders have strong convictions and beliefs. I think you could prove that if you look at leaders who have impacted history or change or business. They had a point of view. My point of view is faith-based. My convictions are biblical principles. And yet I work in a publicly traded stock environment. I believe I can live out all those principles without citing chapter and verse. And that makes the principles real, approachable and interesting to other people who may never have heard of the principles before or where they come from. So I love living them out. You mentioned words or deeds, and, you know, that thing your mom used to say, “Actions always speak louder than words.” I spend my energy checking to see if I’m living my convictions, and I try to rein in my instincts to talk about my convictions. Talk is cheap. Action is where the hard part comes and where the tests come of your convictions, the place where people see if you’re true to those convictions, right? So I’ve tried to put my energy into how I withstand the pressures of this job, how I treat people in good times and in bad, how I share my convictions in a concerned, loving way for other people, not a preachy, I got-it-all-together way. I am very open about my faith. I speak in many faith environments. And I decided, at some point, that that was who I am and that was who I was comfortable being. And if it’s a problem for people, they haven’t told me very often. So I don’t know. It’s worked so far. Are there any Biblical or religious themes that you apply to your corporate leadership? The Bible verse that’s on my calendar every day is Philippians 2:3. Because I haven’t found one that’s more paramount to how I want to lead in my family and in my work. And that is, “Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.” That’s an ESV version, because I really like the choice of words around counting others more significant than yourselves. I believe we’re all born with an inner 2-year-old. And we’d really still like to be laying on the floor, kicking and screaming because we didn’t get the candy bar we wanted. It’s pretty hardwired that we’re self-absorbed little people. And we learn to fake it well, but we’re still pretty much that 2-year-old on the inside. I find that biblical perspective really challenging in every aspect of my day—how I’m spending my time, the decisions that I make. To put them through a filter of whether I’m thinking about myself or whether I’m thinking about others. I mean, it gets you into some really interesting conversations. “Am I doing this because I’ll get a bigger bonus check? Or am I really thinking about the long term interest of this company? Am I doing this truly for my franchise owners, or am I getting some personal benefit that I haven’t been willing to acknowledge?” Those kinds of provocative self-mirror questions hold you to a higher standard. I always say servant leadership is an aspiration, because you can really never claim you’ve arrived. Because as soon as you do, someone will find you—and in a trap of self-interest. It’s something you’re always working toward. Because we all are. We’re all in that trap. So the only question is, are you going to aspire to it, or are you going to use that as filter for your actions and decisions? And try to hold yourself more and more accountable to that over time. With your success, how do you measure achievement in a personal sense? One of my favorite lines from Robert Greenleaf is, “The only test of leadership is that somebody follows.” That’s a simplified version of the question. But I love that text. And I think what I’ve come to understand about my purpose and my calling is that I’m supposed to use my leadership to have an impact on the lives of others and specifically to develop better leaders for our communities, our families and our country. And so I have a personal purpose statement. Mine is to inspire purpose-driven leaders to exhibit confidence and character in all aspects of their lives. And that again holds me to, what am I doing today? As a woman in a prominent leadership role, can you talk about your experience as a businesswoman both now as an influencer, but also when you had positions that were lower on the totem pole? I often get asked, “When did you first know you were a leader?” And I think because I’m an oldest child, I thought I was a leader at a very young age. My first remembrance is when I was directing the family musical play at a reunion at nine years old and telling my sister she was the tree and my brother what song part he was supposed to sing. My siblings would tell you I’ve been giving direction for a very long time. That’s not necessarily leadership. So I think I grew up with a personality for leadership, a desire that helped organize and make things happen. And I experienced my father, who was an incredible business leader. I learned so much about both competence and character from my father, the single most important person in shaping who I am. So I didn’t enter work to be a working woman. I didn’t enter work to change the world or make an impact at all. None of that was really operative. I was trying to figure out how to take the things that I felt gifted to do—I loved marketing in college, and I loved leadership— and figure out, you know, how could I jump in this pond and do some of the things my father was able to do? And he always made it clear that he was impacting lives in business. He never saw it as just a paycheck. He ran 16 factories in Asia and knew people of every culture in the world. He had a deep-rooted love for developing leaders in those countries, in those factories, and he did. So I lived in this bubble where leadership was a cool thing to aspire to. My dad told us, “Do well in school. Work really hard. Give it your best, and things will turn out OK.” He was a deeply faith-based man—always talking to us about character decisions and what’s true and what’s not true in culture— and so that’s had a tremendous impact. The woman question is one I really didn’t think a lot about. Now, I was always among men. It was apparent that I was one of very few women, in particular when you get to the VP level, there are very few women to look to for role models. I can tell you that I was largely confused by the lack of women role models, because if there are no women role models, you have to look mostly at men for your cues. And I believe men and women are different. And so I think it was hard to find my leadership approach without role models. I think it would have been easier if I’d had people to check in with and say, “I do this a little differently. Do you think that’d be ok?” Rather than trying to constantly live by the standards of men that have been doing it this way for years. Trying to fit in. So I always tell particularly young leaders that the most important learning for me as a woman was learning to lead out of my authentic self, my wiring, my gifts, my calling. I needed to stop thinking about what the rest of the world thought about it. Did they think I should work? Did they think I shouldn’t work? Did they think I should do it this way or that way? That really was tripping me up and making me less effective than when I kind of figured out who I was and how I would contribute to the conversation. I’ve been a better leader since. So the sooner you can get to that version of your authentic self, the better. It takes experience. It doesn’t happen overnight. I’m watching that now in my daughters. But that’s where you want to get to. And from a faith perspective, live your life for an audience of One, not all these other people that have opinions about how you should live your life. So I really think that’s where I encourage young leaders to sort out, who do you live your life for? What are your convictions and beliefs? And are you living them authentically in your leadership? up Email Page Journal of Markets & Morality Purchase a subscription to the Journal of Markets & Morality to get access to the most recent issues.

Segundo matéria do jornal "Wall Street Journal", a P&G investiu muito em anúncios na rede social, justamente, por reconhecer que Facebook passou anos desenvolvendo a sua capacidade de concentrar consumidores com base em dados demográficos, hábitos de compra e marcos da vida. Marc Pritchard, diretor de marketing da P&G, disse que a empresa percebeu que levou a estratégia longe demais. "Agora vamos investir em publicidade que nos renda o máximo alcance e tenha maior precisão", disse o executivo ao "Wall Street Journal". Pritchard disse que a P&G não vai cortar gastos com o Facebook, mas terá uma estratégia mais direcionada, como anúncios de fraldas para gestantes. Ele disse que a empresa aumentou os investimentos em sites e plataformas digitais tradicionais e está reduzindo a publicidade em sites menores. Facebook começou a trabalhar com anúncio segmentado em 2007, quando tinha menos de 60 milhões de usuários ativos. No momento, a sua principal plataforma de marketing são as páginas dos usuários em que as empresas promovem gratuitamente seus produtos. No ano passado, o Facebook arrecadou US$ 17,08 bilhões em receita publicitária, aumento de 49% em relação a 2014 e detinha uma base de 1,7 bilhão de usuários ativos mensais. A P&G gasta aproximadamente US$ 7,2 bilhões em publicidade por ano em todo o mundo e já informou que planeja aumentar essas despesas neste ano. O esforço da companhia para melhorar o alcance dos anúncios é evidente. Perto do final do ano passado a empresa começou a apostar mais em anúncios em televisão, de acordo o WSJ. Durante o primeiro trimestre de 2016, os gastos com publicidade da empresa saltaram 11%, para US$ 429 milhões, informou a consultoria Kantar Media.

Facebook Inc. has spent years developing its ability to zero in on consumers based on demographics, shopping habits and life milestones. P&G, the maker of myriad household goods including Tide and Pampers, initially jumped at the opportunity to market directly to subsets of shoppers, from teenage shavers to first-time homeowners. Marc Pritchard, P&G’s chief marketing officer, said the company has realized it took the strategy too far. “We targeted too much, and we went too narrow,” he said in an interview, “and now we’re looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?” Mr. Pritchard said P&G won’t cut back on Facebook spending and will employ targeted ads where it makes sense, such as pitching diapers to expectant mothers. He said P&G has ramped up spending both on digital sites and traditional platforms. One category the company is scaling back: smaller websites that lack the reach of sites such as Facebook, Google and YouTube. On a broader scale, P&G’s shift highlights the limits of such targeting for big brands, one of the cornerstones of Facebook’s ad business. The social network is able to command higher prices for its targeted marketing; the narrower the targeting the more expensive the ad. Related Coverage Retailers Dominate List of Popular Holiday Ads Nov. 23, 2016 Forbes Takes a Page From Snapchat Nov. 22, 2016 BuzzFeed, NBCUniversal to Intertwine Ad Sales and Production Nov. 22, 2016 Mobile Ad Targeting Is Improving, According to Nielsen Nov. 22, 2016 P&G could be the bellwether on how consumer goods companies and big brands use digital advertising. Over the past year some marketers, specifically consumer product companies, have discovered they need to go “much more broad” with their advertising on social media sites such as Facebook, said James Douglas, executive director of social-media agency Society, which is owned by Interpublic Group. Mr. Douglas said case studies show that companies can receive a bigger sales increase if they reach a more significant portion of a platform’s overall audience. For instance, P&G two years ago tried targeting ads for its Febreze air freshener at pet owners and households with large families. The brand found that sales stagnated during the effort, but they rose when the campaign on Facebook and elsewhere was expanded last March to include anyone over 18. A Facebook spokeswoman said its partnership with P&G “grows every year” and the two companies learn from one another. “That has always been the spirit of how we work together and challenge one another,” she said. Facebook started working on a targeted ad system in 2007, when it was an unprofitable three-year-old startup with less than 60 million active users. At the time, its main marketing platform was free Facebook pages through which companies promoted their products. ENLARGE Facebook has since emerged as a marketing platform of singular scale. Last year, Facebook raked in $17.08 billion in ad revenue, up 49% year over year, as advertisers sought the attention of its 1.7 billion monthly active users. Advertisers can pinpoint their target audience precisely. Political candidates can focus on users in congressional districts, restaurant chains can run campaigns to spicy food lovers, and moving companies can find users who are “very likely” to move to another home. “If you could run an ad and reach a million people or run a targeted ad to reach 5,000, you have to have pretty impressive returns on that 5,000 to make it worth it,” said Peter Daboll, chief executive of Ace Metrix, which tests ads for effectiveness and works with Facebook. Cincinnati-based P&G spent roughly $7.2 billion on advertising globally in the year that ended in June, up about 1% from the previous year, according to company filings. P&G said it plans to increase it around 5% for the year that started July 1. Prior to last year’s increase, the company cut spending two years in a row. P&G’s push to find broader reach with its advertising is also evident in the company’s recent increases in television spending. Toward the end of last year P&G began shifting money back into television, according to people familiar with the matter. During the first quarter of 2016, the company’s ad spending jumped 11% to $429 million from the year earlier, Kantar Media said. For many of the largest advertisers in the world, the precise targeting tools touted by Facebook are less of a draw, said Pivotal Research analyst Brian Weiser. “The bigger your brand, the more you need broad reach and less targeted media,” he said. Targeting is paramount for advertisers trying to get users to download a game app or a small business trying to appeal to local customers. Facebook has started offering new tools specifically for large advertisers, including a way to boost brand awareness by showing ads to people who are more likely to pay attention to them. On Tuesday, it introduced changes that make it harder for people to block ads from appearing on its desktop website. “The cornerstone of our ad strategy is a mix of mass reach and personalized targeting that lends well to mobile consumption and is a strong complement to TV,” the Facebook spokeswoman said. Not all big advertisers are pulling back on Facebook’s targeted marketing. Priceline Group Inc. said it expects lower returns in the current quarter from bookings generated from its advertising, much of which goes through Alphabet Inc.’s Google. As a result the travel company plans to increase spending on Facebook’s targeted ads. “We found that a number of things we’ve done on Facebook works well,” Chief Executive Jeffery Boyd said. “We would like to spend more money on Facebook going forward.” Corrections & Amplifications: The correct name of the CEO of Priceline Group Inc. is Jeffery Boyd. An earlier version of this article misstated his name. (Aug. 17) — Suzanne Vranica contributed to this article.

FASHION Makeup artist Pat McGrath unveils Lust 004 glitter lip kits Pat McGrath’s Lust 004 WWD Pat McGrath’s Lust 004 launches at patmcgrath.com on Aug. 30. Pat McGrath’s Lust 004 launches at patmcgrath.com on Aug. 30. (WWD) Rachel Strugatz | WWD Glitter is the hero of Pat McGrath’s latest creation. The makeup artist and global creative design director at Procter & Gamble, who admits she “comes from a land of extremes,” has just dreamed up what she thinks will be beauty’s next must-have lip trend: an uberpigmented, matte lipstick topped with ultrafine glitter. “When people wore glitter before it was tons of eye makeup. The modern way to wear glitter is with bareness. That’s what makes it so fresh,” McGrath said during an interview, during which she unveiled Pat McGrath Labs’ Lust 004, her foray into lips. “It’s [about] a bare face, a modern, bare face with mascara and brow control and a touch of Skin Fetish [McGrath’s highlighter that came out in April] and a divine jeweled lip.” She showed how her lip sets, composed of five products that could be mixed, matched and layered to achieve varying finishes, colors and intensities, bring editorial and runway beauty trends to the consumer. Each kit — available in Version Flesh (nude), Version Vermillion Venom (red) or Version Bloodwine (purple and deep red) — comes with two matte lipsticks; a clear, high-shine lip gloss; saturated gold pigment, and a glitter pot. McGrath said she only creates things she is obsessed with and right now it’s glitter. Lust 004 was born from the glitter lips she conceptualized for Atelier Versace’s couture show in July. Cue the social media frenzy: Kylie Cosmetics adds eye shadows Rachel Brown Kylie Jenner’s march to beauty moguldom is taking another stride today with the release of an eye shadow palette from her namesake brand.

Kylie Jenner’s march to beauty moguldom is taking another stride today with the release of an eye shadow palette from her namesake brand. The nine-shade bronze Kyshadow palette is one of three palettes Kylie Cosmetics is scheduled to launch this year. Jenner revealed news of the $42 palette on... (Rachel Brown) She explained the inspiration and how to apply the new range, and for most, it might seem unlikely that her vision will be able to make it from runway to the lips of regular people. But it’s more versatile than one would think. As demonstrated by a group of three models, who each wore a different colored lip and the corresponding finely ground glitter, the look, while definitely a statement, is not reminiscent of a child’s arts and crafts project. “Glitter is for every day, in my mind,” she mused. “You want it in the daylight, you want it in the sun.” Customers can wear the matte lipstick solo, paint on the corresponding glitter or layer the clear gloss on top of both for optimal shine. A saturated gold pigment could be mixed with the gloss to impart a metallic sheen (to be worn solo on a bare lip, with the matte lipstick to create a high-gloss finish or as a finale step over the glitter) or painted delicately on one’s cupid bow as a lip liner/highlighter hybrid.

McGrath, who is releasing her second product in less than four months, is carefully building a business predicated on a new “cult beauty product model” that is fueled by social media. Similar to Kylie Jenner, McGrath manufactures a product in limited quantities and introduces it to the public via Instagram, where her account @patmcgrathreal has 881,000 followers. She invites her fans to shop it at her e-commerce site. Unlike Jenner, though, McGrath has partnered with Sephora, which will introduce Lust 004 on Sept. 8 in 10 select doors and on sephora.com — while supplies last, of course.

 P&G, the world's biggest ad spender, is cutting back on targeted Facebook ads because they weren't effective Nathan McAlone Aug. 9, 2016, 1:08 PM 51,720 facebook linkedin twitter email print Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Procter & Gamble, the largest ad spender in the world, is cutting down on its targeted Facebook ads, according to The Wall Street Journal. The reason: The company decided the ads weren't effective. Facebook stock fell immediately following the news but is trading at about even for the day. "We targeted too much and we went too narrow," Marc Pritchard, P&G's chief marketing officer, told The Journal. "And now we're looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?" One example cited by The Journal explains P&G's position well. Two years ago the company tried targeting Facebook ads for its Febreze air freshener at "pet owners and households with large families." Sales for Febreze "stagnated" during the campaign but went up when P&G opened it up to everyone over 18 years old. This doesn't mean P&G will cut back on Facebook spending generally, however, and it will still use targeted ads at points. But the implications about the effectiveness of targeted ads for big brands might trouble Facebook, which snagged $17.08 billion in ad revenue last year. Facebook's ability to precisely target ads based on its large swaths of user data has been its main differentiator for almost a decade. Facebook provided the following comment to Business Insider: "Our partnership with P&G grows every year in service of effective and efficient advertising. We learn from each other and iterate. That has always been the spirit of how we work together and challenge one another. The cornerstone of our ad strategy is a mix of mass reach and personalized targeting that lends well to mobile consumption and is a strong complement to TV. Our clients tell us this strategy works because we can deliver relevant marketing to the right audiences, with unprecedented scale. It enables partners like P&G to drive the business metrics they care about. "We see targeting success across the CPG category — for example, campaigns reaching audiences like 'households with dishwashers' or 'non-chocolate candy buyers' that drive awareness and sales. We believe that when brands are focused on the right metrics — ROI versus proxies like cost, we can most effectively help businesses grow."

THE HINDU PHOTOARCHIVES / PIB Paradigm shift India’s economy, which was once characterised by Nehruvian socialism, stands vastly ‘Modified’ today. THE HINDU PHOTOARCHIVES / PIB There is much to be proud of about the evolution of the economy. But it’s time for policymakers to up their game Former Proctor & Gamble India CEO Gurcharan Das is fond of narrating an anecdote that encapsulates the entrepreneurial experience in the India of the ‘licence raj’ era. One bleak winter in the early 1980s, when a flu wave was sweeping across parts of India, Richardson Hindustan (as P&G was then known) ended up selling truckloads of Vicks Vaporub, the cream that provides relief from cold and cough. But rather than serve as cause for celebration, it only induced anxiety in Das. That’s because the company had overshot its government-approved manufacturing capacity, which was considered a cardinal sin in the heavily controlled industrial ecosystem under then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. “My company secretary told me that I could be prosecuted for exceeding the production capacity,” recalls Das. “I lived with that fear — whereas anywhere else, I’d have been rewarded!” Das’ account symbolises the frustrations of entrepreneurs who sought to navigate India’s closed economy during the post-Independence phase, right up until the big-bang reforms of 1991. Even today, vestiges of that restrictive era remain in pockets of the economy, but today – as India stands on the threshold of its 70th Independence Day — it is possible to look back and celebrate, with some caveats, the incredible journey that the country has been on. Changed landscape The economic landscape today is vastly different from 1947 (see Graphic: India in Numbers). What was once predominantly an agrarian economy (agriculture and allied activities accounted for 52 per cent of the GDP in 1951-52; today, that’s down to 15 per cent) has morphed into a semi-industrial and services economy that is today the world’s seventh-largest, with GDP in excess of $2 trillion. Along the way, it has weathered political and economic turmoil on an epic scale, muddled through two decades of Nehruvian, Soviet-style statism, opportunistic invocations of ‘socialism’ during the Indira Gandhi years, and the first tentative efforts at opening up under Rajiv Gandhi, which however only accentuated the infirmities in the economy and culminated in July 1991, when the country came perilously close to the ignominious prospect of defaulting on its external balance of payment obligations. That crisis set the stage for sweeping economic reforms, which have, without risk of exaggeration, dramatically transformed the economic landscape and the business ecosystem and unleashed tremendous entrepreneurial energies, causing old-world industrial empires to reinvent themselves – or fall by the wayside. The momentous nature of what happened in 1991, under the stewardship of then Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, is universally acknowledged. Gurcharan Das puts it bluntly when he says: “If not for the reforms, we would have remained a Third World basket case.” Legitimate pride As RBI Governor at the time of the post-1991 reform process, C Rangarajan, currently Chairman of the Madras School of Economics, played a pivotal role in steering monetary policy. With that experience, together with his experience of having served in various capacities in successive governments, he sums up India’s economic journey over these 70 years thus: “From where we started (at the time of Independence), we have come a long way. And even in terms of growth, one can legitimately be proud of our achievements” (see Interview). In his view, however, India’s standing would have been vastly better today if it had embarked on the reform process in the 1970s, when it first became clear that the state-led model had not quite yielded the kind of growth that had been targeted. “We would have gained another decade and a half at least in terms of higher growth. And given the social orientation of our policymakers, that would have allowed them to move faster to reduce the drawbacks on the social side,” Rangarajan adds. Stark failures India’s failures on the social front are stark: despite decades of “poverty alleviation measures”, it will continue to account for the largest share of the world’s poor for a considerable period, even if it keeps up its rapid economic growth. And its ranking on the global Human Development Index makes a mockery of its claim to being the world’s fastest-growing major economy. But the consensus among economists is that equity is best served by growth. That certainty has often eluded policymakers, with disastrous consequences for both growth and equity. Today, with the Narendra Modi-led government projecting itself as keen to enhance incentives for the private sector, a sense of cautious optimism permeates. “This is the first time in Indian history that the government is at least trying to remove roadblocks for entrepreneurs,” says Das, with perhaps a touch of hyperbole. The past 70 years have not been insubstantial, and there is a widely shared sense that India’s best years are ahead of it. It will, however, need more than good intentions and momentary feel-good sentiments if India is to perform up to its potential.

While toothpaste is not the first thing that comes to mind when parents think of back-to-school products, this campaign demonstrates how caring for one's teeth can be linked to academic performance. The new Crest ad involves a man dressed as Shakespeare sitting at a desk discussing a student that is missing a lively classroom discussion about Hamlet due to tooth pain. The Shakespeare-look-a-like then spouts a series of hashtags that extol the importance of oral care in helping students achieve academic success. As the ad plainly states at the end: "Kids with poor oral health are 3x more likely to miss school." The ad clearly demonstrates how brands that are not traditionally associated with the back-to-school season can remind families about the important role such products play in the life of a student. #1 INNOVATION KEYNOTE VIDEOS Join 5,000,0000 people getting Better & Faster w/ Jeremy Gutsche's Innovation Keynotes ➤ Related Top 10 Slideshows Video Pro Services Innovation Accelerator Innovation Keynotes Trend Reports Custom Dashboards Future Festival Free Resources Innovation Videos & Books Weekly Trend Report NEW: 2017 Trend Report Get a FREE Report Back-to-School Computer LineupsNew HP Systems were Announced Early to Help Parents and Students Comedian-Branded Tech AdsBest Buy and Adam Devine Are Showing Consumers 'How to College' Child-Written Promotional CampaignsTarget's Back-to-School Ads were Written and Directed by Kids Emotional Kid-Oriented AdsKleenex's 'Someone Needs One' Campaign Aims to Relieve Kids' Fears Top 80 Commercial Trends in SeptemberFrom Comedic Air Safety Ads to Reality Show Cereal Campaigns Top 60 Kids' Ideas in SeptemberFrom Candy-Themed Coding Games to Allergy-Friendly Seed Spreads Stats for Shakespearean Toothpaste Commercials Trending: This Quarter & Buzzing Research: 102 clicks in 15 w Interest: > 3 minutes Concept: Benefits Of Oral Care Related: 91 examples / 70 photos Segment: Neutral, 4-18 Comparison Set: 33 similar articles, including: sentimental school ads, back-to-school fashion ads, and comical spelling commercials.

Snapchat When Snapchat unleashed its ad-tech program Snap Partners in June with plans to serve video ads between stories, observers wondered how users would respond to seeing ads alongside their friends' videos and photos. Two months in, Snapchat is already expanding its initial pilot to include more advertisers eager to reach the app's 150 million daily users. The ads appear between strings of photos and videos that users have share with their followers. Snapchat caps the amount of ads so that each person is served three so-called Snap Ads Between Friends promos per day—one in the morning, one in the afternoon and one at night. Over the past few weeks, the number of ads has steadily increased. Based on Adweek's own testing, each Snapchat user views the same number of daily ads, regardless of how much content they consume. In other words, someone who watches 100 stories per day is exposed to the same number of ads as someone who watches a handful of clips. Snapchat declined to comment about its ad load. Ten brands—including Verizon, Express and Procter & Gamble—piloted the ad format earlier this summer, and now the format is available to a wider group of marketers. Dunkin' Donuts, Unilever's skin care brand Simple, L'Oreal-owned Maybelline, Starbucks and JCPenney have all run ads between snaps in the past week. Similar to Snapchat's broader Snap Ads format that runs within Discover and Live Stories, the length of a skippable video ad in between snaps is limited to 10 seconds. They can also be targeted by age, gender, location, type of device, carrier and content affinity. But unlike Discover or Live Story ads, vertical videos between snaps don't include options to "swipe up" to watch a longer video clip or visit a website, which Snapchat has been pushing advertisers to experiment with in recent months. The move to limit the number of daily ads is part of what many see as Snapchat's steady but aggressive advertising push to reach $350 million in revenue this year and $1 billion by the end of 2017, according to leaked documents. To get there and compete for budgets alongside Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest and others, the rollout of ads on Snapchat has been gradual in order to avoid ruining the user experience. The ad formats mimic the app's popular features like lenses and filters that its millennial-heavy audience loves. In 36 days in June and July, Snapchat sold 14 sponsored lenses in the U.S. that can cost upwards of $600,000 for a one-day takeover on non-holiday days. "We have to be thoughtful about the inventory, ad load and the ad experience," Peter Sellis, Snapchat's head of monetization product, told Adweek in June when launching its API. "By doing this the right way, focused on creativity and doing it early, it allows us to be extraordinarily conservative. Something that I think often gets lost is that ad effectiveness can be inversely correlated with the number of ads that the viewer sees. If you see 50 ads in a day, the probability of you remembering them is low."

As we munched on the Indo-Western fusion choice of Pav Bhaji Tortillas, we spoke about a wide range of things: how Amazon Prime will be a huge fillip to Amazon India, the media’s obsession with Indian e-commerce, how fintech is the next big thing for Indian start-ups and so on. As someone tracking investments, I popped the question, “What do you think about the Unilever Dollar Shave acquisition?” He said, “It can’t get more benign than this, right,” essentially alluding to the simplicity of Dollar Shave Club—a start-up that’s a little over four years old and offers a blades-by-subscription service for as little as $3 a month (including shipping and handling). “Perhaps that is what makes it so compelling too,” he was quick to add. There is some merit to that comment. After all, a buttoned-down Unilever, which gives you an impression of an uptight, global biggie, snapped up a scrappy Dollar Shave that feels more like it belongs in the tech sector than the consumer products industry. The announcement of the billion-dollar acquisition, in fact, raised hopes for a lot of venture capitalists back home, with some of them giving themselves a pat on the back as if their thesis of backing niche e-commerce start-ups had just received validation. Some of them also took to Twitter and LinkedIn to voice their enthusiasm. But what makes Dollar Shave so appealing is not a testament to the attraction of e-commerce so much as it is about building a formidable online brand, says a Bloomberg report. Going through media reports will tell you what Dollar Shave achieved in such a short span of time: it actually created a market for razor blades. A report in Harvard Business Review said the online market for razor blades has grown from virtually zero to $263 million, citing estimates from Slice Intelligence, a market research firm, owing to the momentum of Dollar Shave Club. The company turned out to be a disruptive rival and actually snatched market share from incumbents like Gillette, still the No. 1 razor brand, which saw its market share fall from 71% in 2010 to 59% in 2015. (And for the record, Gillette, owned by Procter and Gamble, sued Dollar Shave Club late last year for patent infringement. Dollar Shave Club filed a counter-suit in February.). Also, Dollar Shave turned the industry upside-down with its direct-to-consumer marketing tactics: the day it started selling subscriptions in March 2012, the company released a YouTube video starring founder Michael Dubin. He tells viewers the product is f***ing great, “so gentle a toddler could use it”. The website crashed, but the blades sold out in six hours. So, my question is, do we have a Dollar Shave Club in India? I asked quite a few venture capitalists. The answer ranged from “None” to “We will get there” to “Oh yes! We do.” Predictably, the third bunch pointed to a new phenomenon—vertical e-commerce start-ups emerging in India. The names thrown around included niche plays building in jewellery segments, apparel and so on. Really? Are these assets unique? Has any of them built a direct-to-consumer engine where a large traditional company can come tomorrow to bolt its other brands on and pay such a huge strategic premium? Have any of them actually created a new market to grow at a lightning speed and snatched market share from incumbents? Coming specifically to vertical e-commerce plays in India dubbed as “brands”, it is more like a mixed bag. We already know that many online apparel firms are in trouble. However, the good news is that some players are taking a full stack approach and realizing that the era of lead-generation is over. A few like Bluestone come to mind. Looking at the Unilever-Dollar Shave Club deal, involving the acquisition of a disruptive rival for a five-times revenue multiple, as snapping up just another e-commerce start-up is a puerile way of looking at things. The key here is that Dollar Shave built a unique, formidable, and disruptive digital brand, which pretty much upended the industry’s traditional business model. Also, if one reads the blog of early investor David Pakman , he never saw Dollar Shave Club as an e-commerce firm from the very beginning. Venture capitalists trying to build another Dollar Shave Club in India should start with such a thesis. There is a huge macro opportunity out there—any report from a large consulting firm will tell you that the consumer market in India is exploding. The fact is that this market is right now being driven a lot by pricing and a little by convenience. There is a huge potential to build a habit-forming product such as Dollar Shave and make it addictive. “If I open the drawer of my son, it is stacked up with razor blades of Dollar Shave. One, he is too lazy to (cancel the subscription service), and second, he just loves the offering,” said another US-based venture capital investor. Dollar Shave became addictive by learning about its audience; it curates messages specifically meant to keep them engaged. With each delivery, customers get a Bathroom Minutes magazine. So before you club it with all the other e-commerce companies, think twice. And just so you know, there is a report today which says that the desi version of Dollar Shave Club—Bombay Shave Club—has raised money from angel investors. It shouldn’t be a mere copy of Dollar Shave Club but a desi version that works in India. Just like Pav Bhaji Tortillas. Shrija Agrawal is Mint’s deals editor.

InvestorPlace 8/10/2016 Charles Sizemore © Jerome Favre/Bloomberg The Apple Inc. logo is displayed at one of the company's stores in Hong Kong. People come from all around the world to see Mount Everest. But if you lived in Nepal and saw it lurking in the distance every day, it might not seem nearly as impressive. You might take it for granted or even dismiss it as no big deal.  Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 111.22 -0.58 -0.52% Twitter Inc TWTR ▼ 18.20 -0.43 -2.31% Kellogg Co K ▼ 73.35 -1.14 -1.53% That’s really where we are today with Apple (AAPL) and the absolutely gargantuan Apple cash hoard. The tally for Apple’s cash and marketable securities has been so large for so long that no one really pays attention to it anymore. In fact, it seems the most common thing I hear said about the Apple cash stockpile these days is that “it’s really not that big.” People cite the fact that much of the quoted cash pile is really longer-term securities and remind you about Apple’s debt and potential tax implications. Frankly, that’s ridiculous. Apple Has a Lot of “Cash” Even allowing for a massive tax haircut, AAPL’s cash hoard would rank as one of history largest treasures … a fortune that would make Croesus blush. As of Apple’s latest quarterly earnings report, the company had $231.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. The Apple cash balance — the gross number, before any debt or tax considerations — would represent the 13th-largest company in the world: bigger than Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT) and Procter & Gamble Co (PG), and just a few billion shy of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). 9 Stocks That Will Sprint Past Everything Else Of course, Apple’s cash is mostly overseas, while Apple’s $72.4 billion in debt is mostly domestic. But let’s pretend that AAPL suddenly got religion and decided it wanted to be debt-free now. And let’s further assume that Apple wanted to move its entire cash hoard stateside because … go America! And let’s take this one step further and assume that Apple is paying the full 35% U.S. corporate tax rate on the whole pile of money. (None of these are realistic assumptions, mind you, but let’s go through the exercise anyway.) After taxes, Apple’s $231.5 billion in cash and securities becomes $150.5 billion. That would still put the Apple cash hoard in the top 30 largest companies in the S&P 500 … about on par with Phillip Morris International (PM). After stripping out the $72.4 billion in debt, the $150.5 billion becomes $78.1 billion. That’s still not exactly chump change. In fact, that’s nearly double the average (mean) market cap of all S&P 500 companies and more than four times bigger than the median market cap of all S&P 500 companies! And remember, this all assumes the absolute worst-case scenario for taxes. Were Apple to actually attempt to repatriate its cash, it would likely negotiate much better terms. After all, if AAPL really thought it was going to get hit at 35% no matter what … wouldn’t it have gritted its teeth and brought the cash ashore by now? So, yes. The Apple cash hoard is a big deal, no matter how you slice it. Taking a Deeper Look at Apple’s War Chest A skeptic will point out that only $18.2 billion of the $231.5 billion is actual “cash” in the bank. The rest is held in “marketable securities.” That’s true, but let’s dig a little deeper there. The quarterly 10-Q report gives a fair amount of detail as to what makes up the Apple cash hoard: Cash and Marketable Securities Fair Market Value (millions) as of 6/25/2016 Cash$9,118 Money Market Funds$3,318 Mutual Funds$1,587 U.S. Treasury Securities$45,998 U.S. Agency Securities$7,511 Non-U.S. Government Securities$7,177 CDs and Time Deposits$3,729 Commercial Paper$4,708 Corporate Securities$128,898 Municipal Securities$961 Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities$18,515 Total: $231.52 billion The biggest slice of Apple’s portfolio is made up of corporate bonds, which at $128.9 billion comprise about 56% of the total. The accounting sticklers are technically correct when they say these bonds are not technically “cash.” They’re not. Unlike cash and U.S. Treasury securities, corporate bonds do have credit risk. But credit risk over a diversified bond portfolio is manageable and not particularly concerning. And that other great scourge of bond investors — interest rate risk — isn’t much of an issue because Apple intends to hold them until maturity. But let’s say that Apple needs to unload some of its bonds. As of quarter-end, AAPL was sitting on modest capital gains of about $1.3 billion on its total portfolio and about $750 million on its corporate bonds. So, even allowing for slight slippage due to transactions costs, Apple could liquidate its portfolio for cash if it needed to. But the key takeaway here is that Apple’s marketable securities — while not technically “cash” — are close enough to cash for our purposes here. These are bonds, CDs, money market funds and other conservative savings vehicles you might find in the proverbial widows-and-orphans portfolio. Bottom Line: Quit the Nitpicking Yes, while the Apple cash hoard may no longer awe us like it once did … frankly, it should. Apple has managed to maintain its war chest while also embarking on one of the most aggressive dividend and share repurchase programs in history. If all goes as planned, Apple will have delivered more than $300 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchases by 2017 since starting the program in 2012. No matter how you slice it, that’s impressive. Charles Lewis Sizemore, CFA is the principal of Sizemore Capital Management, a registered investment adviser in Dallas, Texas.

The quarterly 10-Q report gives a fair amount of detail as to what makes up the Apple cash hoard: Cash and Marketable Securities Fair Market Value (millions) as of 6/25/2016 Cash $9,118 Money Market Funds $3,318 Mutual Funds $1,587 U.S. Treasury Securities $45,998 U.S. Agency Securities $7,511 Non-U.S. Government Securities $7,177 CDs and Time Deposits $3,729 Commercial Paper $4,708 Corporate Securities $128,898 Municipal Securities $961 Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities $18,515 Total $231,520 The biggest slice of Apple’s portfolio is made up of corporate bonds, which at $128.9 billion comprise about 56% of the total. The accounting sticklers are technically correct when they say these bonds are not technically “cash.” They’re not. Unlike cash and U.S. Treasury securities, corporate bonds do have credit risk. But credit risk over a diversified bond portfolio is manageable and not particularly concerning. And that other great scourge of bond investors — interest rate risk — isn’t much of an issue because Apple intends to hold them until maturity. But let’s say that Apple needs to unload some of its bonds. As of quarter-end, AAPL was sitting on modest capital gains of about $1.3 billion on its total portfolio and about $750 million on its corporate bonds. So, even allowing for slight slippage due to transactions costs, Apple could liquidate its portfolio for cash if it needed to. Twitter Stock Looks Like a Sweet Trade (TWTR) But the key takeaway here is that Apple’s marketable securities — while not technically “cash” — are close enough to cash for our purposes here. These are bonds, CDs, money market funds and other conservative savings vehicles you might find in the proverbial widows-and-orphans portfolio. Bottom Line: Quit the Nitpicking Yes, while the Apple cash hoard may no longer awe us like it once did … frankly, it should. Apple has managed to maintain its war chest while also embarking on one of the most aggressive dividend and share repurchase programs in history. If all goes as planned, Apple will have delivered more than $300 billion to shareholders in dividends and repurchases by 2017 since starting the program in 2012. No matter how you slice it, that’s impressive. Charles Lewis Sizemore, CFA is the principal of Sizemore Capital Management, a registered investment adviser in Dallas, Texas.

RELATED COMPANIES EXPAND ADD TO Portfolio Watchlist OUTLOOK? +ve -ve Unilever x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ In a chat with ET Now, Ashish Bhasin, VP, Advertising Agency Association of India, explains why Patanjali is old wine in new bottle with a difference. Excerpts: ET Now: Do you think that the likes of Colgate and Nesle will also milk Patanjali's brand pull strategy? Ashish Bhasin: Almost certainly. I think there are two phenomena that are working in the case of Patanjali. Firstly, as a country we have a very positive inclination towards natural products. For example, when we fall ill, we all go back to our grandmothers' recipes, mothers things, etc. This is a very inherent insight of Indian culture which Patanjali has gotten on to. Now that Patanjali has opened up the gates, there is no reason why a Hindustan Lever or a Procter & Gamble or a Dabur or a Marico will not take advantage of it. And indeed, Colgate. I think Patanjali has done very well. They have scaled up at a phenomenal pace. The challenge is now what they do when more and more players enter and start capitalising on the trend — how they keep refreshing their brands. Distribution is going to be key because beyond a point they will not be able to rely only upon their own franchise stores. India has more than 6,25,000 villages. So, if you have to reach everywhere you have got to use the existing retail supply chain. Whether or not are they able to make that jump will be very critical in their scaling up. I feel the multinationals and other players in the FMCG area will actually gain from this, because a very big segment has been opened up. An insight which was inherently lying hidden is now open for all to tap. ET Now: If Patanjali is old wine in new bottle, what is it that they've done right that the Daburs and the Maricos couldn't do for years? Ashish Bhasin: This insight was always there — it is probably 5,000 years old. It's just that there was a latent consumer need and Patanjali has been able to capitalise on that at the right price point. It is not the first time in history that it is happening. There are other similar analogies. Unilever used to sell Surf at Rs 30/kilo. Nirma launched at Rs 8-9/kilo. Unilever thought that Nirma was never going to succeed, but there was a market for a low-priced product. The most important point is that one that segment opens up, it also opens the eyes of the other players. It has happened in other segments and other categories as well. There are latent needs lying there and nobody is capitalising upon it, and suddenly a player comes in and disrupts in in whole. In Nirma's case it was Karsanbhai, now it is Patanjali. You are right when you say it's just old wine in new bottle. But is that not what insights are all about? You figure out the deep consumer insights, you figure out if there is a need and you try and satisfy it at the right price point. I think Patanjali has done a good job of it. But I also think they have actually opened up a completely new category. If I were a Unilever or a Marico or an ITC, I would actually see this is as a big opportunity for the medium to long term rather than as an threat in the short term.

Are companies doing enough to step it up for women with the right product? By ET Bureau | Aug 10, 2016, 05.14 AM IST Post a Comment READ MORE ON » Malini Parmar | Harish Bijoor Consults | Glenmark | Fogg deo | Darshan Patel In a nation where sanitary napkins were bought at pharmacies, covered with newspaper or a black plastic bag, things are finally looking up. RELATED COMPANIES EXPAND ADD TO Portfolio Watchlist OUTLOOK? +ve -ve Glenmark x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ By Shramana Ganguly India's IT capital Bengaluru, Malini Parmar was finalising the design of menstrual cups that she would soon launch for Indian women. When Zivame screamed out from smartphones and desktops about two years ago, questioning Indian women on the "fit" of her innerwear, it was a revolution of sorts. Then, stand-up comic Aditi Mittal shredded period shame to bits on social media. First, it was lingerie. Then came sexual health. Be it Parmar or Fogg deo promoter Darshan Patel, who is set to launch a women's health product in September, or Vikas Bagaria, who has formulated toilet seat sanitiser PeeSafe to make visits to public washrooms stress-free; entrepreneurs have dared to move beyond the cosmetic to offering sexual wellbeing products to Indian women. "Women's sexual wellbeing has finally come out of the closet and hence, something like a menstrual cup will find acceptance in India," reasons Parmar, creator of Stonesoup Wings. Working since 2011 in the field of waste management, Parmar hopes Indian women would replace disposable sanitary pads with menstrual cups that she claims are more environmental-friendly and safe. At Rs 800 for a cup that is reusable for 10 years, it is a sustainable proposition that she hopes would catch on with Indian women. Parmar is going against the tide in a country where women's health is restricted to whispers. But she hopes that she would find a venture capitalist to back her plans to manufacture 1000 and eventually 5000 menstrual cups per month. In a nation where packs of sanitary napkins bought at pharmacies are still covered with newspaper or a black plastic bag, things are finally looking up. "The sanitary napkin buy is still not a matter of open pride, but the product category itself has come out of the closet," notes brand-strategy specialist Harish Bijoor of Harish Bijoor Consults. With women exposed to global commentary around period power, brands have become frank in discussing topics that they would otherwise shy away from. "However, while the big stakeholders are still hesitant to break the mould, smaller brands are taking the lead," notes Santosh Padhi, founder, Taproot India. Menstrual cups, tampons, vaginal washes and more, are treated less and less like contraband. "These are still not open drawing room conversation subjects of mixed sex gatherings, but we are getting there," notes Bijoor. Back in 2012, when Glenmark Pharmaceuticals launched vaginal hygiene brand VWash, it focused on clinics. Not until a year-and-half later, did the brand make it to OTC. Modern trade happened much later, 2014 onwards, recollects Sujesh Vasudevan, president, GPL. "While this category is well-developed in Asian markets, India is still in its infancy. Yet, the response is encouraging and the product is gradually becoming want-based from need-based," he says reflecting on how the product's share through direct retail purchase now exceeds clinic sales. In Ahmedabad, yet another entrepreneur has challenged the conventional. Aditi Gupta's comic narrative Menstrupedia of "how, why and when" of the monthly cycles of a woman began in May 2013 with crowdfunding of Rs 5.15 lakh. Since its inception it has been read by thousands of girls and women. Whisper-maker P&G has teamed up with Gupta to stop "period shame" that affects the lives of millions of girls across India, who are incapacitated by period stigma, made to skip school and considered "unclean". P&G and Menstrupedia ran 'Touch The Pickle' campaign that won a Grand Prix at Cannes Lions. Some of these brands have used advertising to bring the subject out in the open. Sujesh recollects that VWash TVC happened around mid-2013. "Considering the subject was very sensitive, we had to communicate to the target group keeping that perspective in mind and yet ensure that it does not make families uncomfortable." Modern trade has been of great help in improving access since women could comfortably pick up the product off the shelves. With women accepting their sex-based needs and embracing brands that improve health, entrepreneurs like Vikas Bagaria and Malini Parmar have begun working overtime. "Women have started accepting that there are gaps pertaining to products taking care of their sexual wellbeing. Why else would more women welcome products like PeeSafe or vaginal washes or after intercourse washes," says Vikas Bagaria, promoter of toilet sanitiser spray PeeSafe. Bloggers have been reviewing his brand and influencing the new-age consumer, both men and women. Bagaria has sold over one lakh spray cans in the last 18 months and hopes to launch vaginal washes and similar products in future. He's seeking about `3.5 cr for expansion and has had acquisition talks with FMCG majors. Says Sudarshan Banerjee, director Utopeia Communicationz: "It cannot be denied that there is a significant amount of chatter on sexual health, look up crowdsourced feminist accounts of 'GenderlogIndia' and the recent buzz created by 'Agents of Ishq'. New age media companies and content producers like TVF have started channels like 'Girliyapa' where they have covered topics like 'Periods' & 'girls buying condoms' in a humorous format." Banerjee, however, points out this is a case of people and their channels challenging conventional thinking, and not enough is reflecting on the brands' side. "There are a few cases that do come to mind, like Whisper's 'Touch the Pickle' which was celebrated at international award festivals and the recent ad by Piramal's iCan on contraception with the women saying, "Ab hum kucch kahein", but maybe it is still taboo in company boardrooms or brand marketing offices," he says adding: "Honestly, one hopes women in advertising and on the client's side would lead conversations about women's health more through their brands and marketing channels."

Most Popular Getty Author Created with Sketch. By Ross Benes Aug 9, 2016 Sure, it's pretty fun to engage in casual Cold War rhetoric whenever an All-American athlete crushes a Russian competitor. But it's arguably just as interesting to observe Olympians getting creative with their Zika prevention, doping fiascoes, and athletes being guided toward substandard living quarters. Over the past few weeks, Adweek's Christine Birkner has reported on another interesting Olympics topic that goes beyond the events themselves—corporate advertising and intellectual property. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Birkner reports that only official Olympic sponsors can use words such as "Olympic" or terms such as "Rio 2016" on their social media accounts. Non-official sponsors are also banned from posting Olympics results, wishing Olympians luck, or hosting Olympic-themed events for their employees. As restrictive as those rules seem, they used to be even worse. According to Adweek: In past Olympics, under the IOC's Rule 40, official sponsors like McDonald's, Procter & Gamble and Visa had a lock on advertising during the games. Athletes were barred from tweeting about non-official sponsors, and non-sponsors were not allowed to feature Olympic athletes that they had sponsorship deals with in ads. In February 2015, the IOC announced changes to the rule, which were adopted by the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) in June 2015. Those changes allow athletes to appear in generic advertising that does not explicitly mention the games or use any Olympic intellectual property (the Olympic rings, and terms such as "Olympics" "2016" "Rio," "games" and "gold" are off limits). Athletes also are now allowed to tweet about non-official sponsors provided they don't use such Olympic IP. More From Olympics 2016 20 articles No Zika Cases Were Detected From the Olympics Team Great Britain Had a Massive Luggage Fail These Were the Most Popular Rio Athletes on Tinder Nike Wants You to Know That It Won the Olympics Colbert Will Make an Honest Man Out of Ryan Lochte With the rules loosened, a non-official sponsor such as Under Armour can now promote an ad featuring an Olympian such as Michael Phelps. Previously, an ad like this would not have been allowed. But notice how the ad doesn't feature any Olympic references or logos. Birkner reports that companies are using various creative tactics to get around the intellectual property regulations. These tactics include alternative hashtags, patriotic Snapchat lenses, and using animals and animated fruit in place of humans when depicting athletic events in ads. Sponsorships are a huge part of the Olympics, so it makes sense that the USOC wants to control the advertising around the games. The restrictions may seem overreaching, but then again, when it comes to the intersection of social/digital media and intellectual property rights, society has just been making up shit as it goes. What's interesting about these rules is how they imperceptibly handicap many businesses from shameless branding.

(Photo by Jacob Wheeler)The Center for Michigan | Bridge Magazine  By Jacob Wheeler | Bridge Magazine Sometime early next year, Billie Livingston will close the doors for the last time to her eclectic clothing store, Billies Women's Fashions in downtown Cheboygan. The 125-year-old building at the corner of Main and Division has hosted businesses longer than any other venue in this once booming logging and industrial town near the top of Michigan's mitten. The shop, which is 28 years old, will be one of nearly 20 vacant storefronts on a three-block stretch of downtown. "I'm very pro-Cheboygan, and I don't want any more empty storefronts," said Livingston, who plans to retire. "But things are not getting better. "The average income in Cheboygan is $22,000. The locals can't afford to shop here, even though my prices are fair. They go shop at the Salvation Army." For nearly three decades Billie Livingston has watched Cheboygan empty, sometimes slowly and sometimes in bursts. When the Procter & Gamble plant downtown closed in 1990, it eliminated hundreds of jobs. WalMart's arrival two years later lent hope to some, but when it doubled in size and added a superstore in 2002, retailers downtown couldn't compete and went out of business. Cheboygan Memorial Hospital, which once employed 400 people, went bankrupt in 2012 and sat idle for six weeks before McLaren acquired it and re-opened it as a wing of its Petoskey hospital. The Cheboygan medical center is now a skeleton of its former self and employs only 150. Billie Livingston is closing her Cheboygan clothing shop after 28 years. The Center for Michigan | Bridge Magazine  Debating the next chapter The 2008 economic recession hit Cheboygan when she was already down. Since the mid-20th Century, this city has suffered a steady decrease in population; that figure dropped by another 7 percent between 2006 and today. Cheboygan has also lost a whopping 22 percent of its businesses and 16 percent of its jobs in the past decade. "We used to be classified as a retirement community, but retirees can't live here if they have health issues because we don't have a (full-service) hospital," said Livingston. "The nearest hospital is an hour away in Petoskey. What happens if you have a heart attack?" Following the recession, Livingston has also witnessed fewer downstate auto workers come to spend their money. Back in the 1950s and '60s many General Motors workers would buy retirement homes at nearby Mullett Lake. Across the street from Billies, Zany Kitchen, a cooking accessories store, will close after Labor Day. Owner Susan Ball plans to retire after eight years in business. "People ask me 'You can't close the store, where am I gonna shop?'" Ball said. "But I'm 65. I could go another five years, but I don't think anything's going to be different here." Ball said she hopes to spend her winters soaking up the rays in Mexico and visiting her son in Napa Valley, Calif. Billie Livingston, meanwhile, will spend more time with her son who lives near Ann Arbor. "My son said he'll never come back," said Livingston. "Cheboygan needs jobs to bring back young people." As the workers have left, so have the town's young families. Cheboygan once had five grade schools; now it has one. According to City Manager Tom Eustice, the number of students at the high school dropped from 720 to 559 over the past 10 years. The average age in Cheboygan County is 55, said Eustice. Susan Ball is closing her kitchen shop, Zany Kitchen, after Labor Day. "I could go another five years," she said, "but I don't think anything's going to be different here."The Center for Michigan | Bridge Magazine  Ball said she believes that Cheboygan needs to shed its identity as a manufacturing town and more fully embrace tourism. The city sits on Lake Huron, at the mouth of the Cheboygan River, just 20 minutes southeast of the Mackinac Bridge. "Cheboygan has always thought of itself as a manufacturing town because we had Procter & Gamble, but it never recovered after they left," said Ball. "We've been left out because we have not gone after tourism. And the young people who grow up here move away to get a job." A port of hope Meanwhile, the city is working with the Cheboygan Downtown Development Authority and the Chamber of Commerce on a Port of Cheboygan project to develop a domestic and international deep water port. Eustice frames the initiative, underway since 2010 as a way to attract business investment and manufacturing back to Cheboygan. Some business owners think this is the wrong approach. "They're putting the cart before the horse," Livingston said. "We have no industry here. They need to go out and search for industry, first. The city needs to hire a publicist or marketing firm to promote Cheboygan." Ball thinks opening and promoting new businesses related to tourism is the path forward. Tourism is a large part of the economies of nearby Mackinaw City and Petoskey. "Because we have not gone after tourism, we're being left out." Some in Cheboygan are excited about Meijer breaking ground on a retail location outside of town in 2017, but others worry the big-box store will continue to bleed jobs downtown. Another cherished local business, Alcock's Market, shuttered its doors this year after it failed to compete with the Speedway gas station one block away, which had expanded to add beer, wine and pizza by the slice. Cheboygan does have a precious few examples of young people staying in town and running a business. But it's not easy, said Alicia Stanford, 33, who together with her mother runs The Brick Oven outside of town near a Kmart. The pizza restaurant has reduced its service to 4 days a week in the summer and just 1 day a week in the winter. "We're not raking in the dough," said Stanford. "We barely make it."

It has 1.7 billion users, and it knows a ton about them, which is why it did $17 billion in ad revenue last year. But despite years of trying to convince advertisers otherwise, Facebook is still not TV — the place advertisers go when they want to spend huge sums on brand advertising, meant to create overall awareness of their products. Instead, Facebook is the place advertisers go for direct response ads: Ads that send you somewhere when you click on them, so you can buy or download something immediately. Facebook is better at DR ads than anyone — see that second sentence at the top — but DR ads are of limited use for some advertisers. We got a reminder of that today, when the Wall Street Journal reported that P&G, the world’s biggest advertiser, was going to pull back on the targeted ads it was running on Facebook, because targeted ads weren’t helping P&G sell Tide and Pampers. But P&G is increasing its TV budget. P&G isn’t cutting back on its overall Facebook spend, and this news isn’t going to be a long-term problem for Facebook. Remember when GM also declared that Facebook ads don’t work? Back in May 2012? The same week Facebook went public? It worked out for Facebook in the end. But it does underscore why Facebook is running, as fast as it can, to becoming a company that shows you videos, and eventually video ads.

But the pressure is not just reserved for the athletes. The mothers of the three of the gymnasts told “Good Morning America” they are just as nervous as their daughters, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and the youngest team member, 16-year-old Laurie Hernandez. Gabby’s mother, Natalie Hawkins, has been through all of the excitement and nerves of the Olympics before, but said Rio is still hitting her differently. “I think it’s a little different because Gabrielle is four years older and just to see the way she’s handling everything now … More subtle, more grounded,” Hawkins explained from the P&G family home in Rio, where Olympians' families spend time watching events, eating meals and even getting makeovers. Rio Olympics 2016: Gymnastics Star Simone Biles Reveals Her Celebrity Crush, Favorite Food Take Olympic Trivia Quiz to See How Much You Know About the Games Nellie Biles’ daughter Simone is expected to win big as she steps into the Olympics spotlight for the first time. “I think that Simone tries real hard not to pay attention to what the expectation is of others,” said Biles, whose daughter has been predicted to win five gold medals. “I believe there’s more pressure on me than on Simone because I am so nervous. I mean, I am just a wreck. And Simone knows that so she is the one who would text me or call me, ‘Mom, I am doing good and I’m ready.’” As their daughters prepare to compete tonight, the moms are taking it all in-- Especially Wanda Hernandez, whose daughter Laurie is the first U.S. Hispanic-born gymnast to make the Olympic team in 30 years. “Proud, very proud of Laurie,” Hernandez said of her teenage daughter. “And just grateful for the moment. At this point we’re just enjoying the team work, the leaders. Kudos to all of these parents. All the team and all the team moms, and just everybody that competes out there because it’s not just about our girls. Also other girls that have sweat, that have made such an effort whether you’re an elite or you’re college gymnastics or having fun—I can’t do it. “The moment you get on the beam, wow,” she added. “A lot of respect from me. I’m just totally grateful and enjoying the team camaraderie and the fact that Laurie has pure leaders and educators, coaches to look up to.

The market breadth indicating the overall health of the market was negative. On BSE, 1,387 shares fell and 1,004 shares rose. A total of 103 shares were unchanged. The BSE Mid-Cap index was currently off 0.79%. The fall in this index was higher than the Sensex's decline in percentage terms. The BSE Small-Cap index was currently off 0.56%, matching the Sensex's fall in percentage terms. In overseas stock markets, most Asian shares rose as US crude oil traded near its highest price in two weeks. US stocks closed lower yesterday, 8 August 2016, after touching record highs as Wall Street caught its breath in the wake of last week's upbeat jobs data.

SRF said consolidated net sales declined 0.86% to Rs 1195.08 crore in Q1 June 2016 over Q1 June 2015, mainly due to the consistent subdued commodity prices. The company said that the surge in profitability can be attributed to robust demand, operational efficiency with renewed focus on cost improvement and market penetration especially in the international market. Meanwhile in a separate announcement after market hours yesterday, 8 August 2016, the company said that its board approved setting up third multipurpose plant at SRF's chemical complex in Dahej, Gujarat at an estimated cost of Rs 180 crore. The board also approved setting up Chloromethanes plant at SRF's chemical complex in Dahej, Gujarat at an estimated cost of Rs 165 crore. Nitin Fire Protection Industries tumbled 7.25% after the company reported net loss of Rs 5.25 crore in Q1 June 2016 compared with net profit of Rs 3.39 crore in Q1 June 2015. The company's net sales declined 40.9% to Rs 79.32 crore in Q1 June 2016 over Q1 June 2015. The result was announced after market hours yesterday, 8 August 2016. Mukand rose 6.41% after the company reported net profit of Rs 10.26 crore in Q1 June 2016 compared with net loss of Rs 5.69 crore in Q1 June 2015. The company's net sales declined 0.2% to Rs 673.39 crore in Q1 June 2016 over Q1 June 2015. The result was announced after market hours yesterday, 8 August 2016. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept its benchmark lending rate viz. the repo rate unchanged at 6.5% after a monetary policy review today, 9 August 2016. The RBI also kept the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled banks unchanged at 4% of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL). The central bank said it will continue to provide liquidity as required and will progressively lower the average ex ante liquidity deficit in the system from 1% of NDTL to a position closer to neutrality. The RBI announced the outcome of the monetary policy review at around 11:00 IST. The RBI said that the recent sharper-than-anticipated increase in food prices has pushed up the projected trajectory of inflation over the rest of the year. The central bank also said that the strong improvement in sowing on the back of the monsoon's steady progress, along with supply management measures, augers well for the food inflation outlook. According to the central bank, risks to the inflation target of 5% for March 2017 continue to be on the upside. The RBI has retained the projected GVA growth projection for 2016-17 at 7.6%. According to the central bank, the risk to this projection is evenly balanced. The central bank expects the momentum of growth to be quickened by the normal monsoon raising agricultural growth and rural demand, as well as by the stimulus to consumption spending that can be expected from the disbursement of pay, pension and arrears following the implementation of the 7th CPC's award. The passage of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Bill augurs well for the growing political consensus for economic reforms. While timely implementation of GST will be challenging, its implementation will raise returns on investment across much of the economy and also strengthen government finances over the medium-term, according to the central bank. The RBI said that the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and will continue to emphasise the adequate provision of liquidity. According to the central bank, easy liquidity conditions are already prompting banks to modestly transmit past policy rate cuts through their MCLRs (Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate) and pro-active liquidity management should facilitate more pass-through. Meanwhile, the amended goods and services tax (GST) constitutional amendment bill was passed by the Lok Sabha yesterday, 8 August 2016. The bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha last week. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Lok Sabha said that with GST, the government intends to bring uniformity in taxation. Most of the things that can impact consumer inflation have been kept out of the ambit of GST, Modi said. He was intervening during the debate in the Lok Sabha on the GST Bill yesterday, 8 August 2016. The government plans to implement the nationwide GST from 1 April 2017. The main objective of the GST is to eliminate excessive taxation. GST is a uniform indirect tax levied on goods and services across a country. The measure would harmonize 11 state and central levies into a national sales tax, reducing business transaction costs.

There are very few things that are guaranteed in the investing world, but the best dividend stocks always come through for shareholders quarter after quarter. Source: Simon Cunningham via Flickr The biggest concern for investors searching for dividend stocks is that a company will cut its dividend at the first sign of financial hardship. As impressive as is for companies to maintain its dividends through thick and thin, some companies kick dividend reliability up a notch higher. Remarkably, a handful of blue-chip dividend stocks have an impeccable track record of more than 50 consecutive years of dividend hikes. That’s right, the Vietnam War, stagflation, two oil booms and busts, the Dot Com Bubble and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression have come and gone, and these five dividend stocks have upped their payouts in each of the last 50 years. Five of the Most Reliable Dividend Stocks Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) owns popular brands like Motrin, Tylenol, Benadryl, Band-Aid and Listerine. The dividend stock currently yields 2.6% after an incredible 54 consecutive years of dividend hikes. 9 Stocks to Buy That Will Sprint Past Everything Else JNJ stock issued its most recent dividend hike in May, when its quarterly payment climbed from $0.75 to $0.80. In the last 50 years, the S&P 500 has produced a total return of 1,880%. In that same time, JNJ’s total return is a staggering 4,800%. In recent years, the dividend stock has shown no signs of slowing down. JNJ’s total return in the last decade is 94%, significantly greater than the S&P 500’s return of 70%. The Coca-Cola Co (KO) Not to be outdone, The Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) stock has its own streak of 54 years of consecutive dividend hikes. In addition to Coca-Cola Classic, KO owns 19 other billion-dollar drink brands, including Dasani, Sprite, Powerade and Minute Maid. KO’s current yield is 3.2%, including its most recent quarterly dividend hike from $0.33 to $0.35 in March. KO stock has returned 3,050% in the past 50 years and 99% in the last 10 years. The company’s remarkable consistency has even caught the eye of Warren Buffett, one of the dividend stock’s largest investors. Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW) When Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW) stock upped its quarterly dividend from $0.28 to $0.35 in July, it marked the company’s 53rd consecutive year of higher dividends. Today, LOW yields 1.7%. In the past 50 years, LOW stock has been one of the top performers in the market, producing a total return of 15,980%. Over the last decade, the dividend stock has returned 195%. Remarkably, LOW’s net income is down 18% in the last decade, but the company has reduced its share count via buyouts by about 5% per year in that time. 3M Co (MMM) 3M Co (NYSE:MMM) was founded 114 years ago, and it has upped its dividend payment for each of the last 58 years: MMM recently upped its dividend from $1.025 to $1.11 in February. The stock currently yields 2.5%. Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc: VRX Stock Is Finally Worth a Look Again! In the past 50 years, MMM stock has produced a total return of 1,760%. Even after that impressive run, MMM is one of the top dividend stocks in the market in 2016, up 18% year-to-date. Proctor & Gamble Co (PG) All of the stocks mentioned above have impressive histories of dividend hikes. However, Proctor & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG) is the only stock among the group that currently has a streak of 60 consecutive years of dividend hikes. PG is the owner of household brands like Crest, Tide, Pampers, Head & Shoulders and Gillette. The stock’s most recent dividend hike came in April when it upped its quarterly payment from $0.6629 to $0.6695. PG has been one of the superstar dividend stocks of the last 50 years and has produced a total return of 2,710% in that time. As of this writing, Wayne Duggan did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Advertising23 November 2016 Creative Works US Creative Work of the Week: Hill Holliday gives Bank of America’s holiday spot a magical twist Marketing23 November 2016 Opinion How it feels to be courted as an influencer More News Alphabet a year on: Why Google's parent company gets a B for brand strategy Opinion By Tom Adams-10 August 2016 11:50am A year since Google announced it was restructuring under new parent company Alphabet, FutureBrand's Tom Adams spells out the perception problems it still needs to overcome. Alphabet’s birth was announced in a blog post by Google co-founder Larry Page on 10 August 2015. The missive makes clear that financial clarity drove the decision to restructure. Nevertheless, Page also wanted people to get “super excited” and for the entity to stand for something new. The markets have since rewarded Alphabet for clarity about how much money Google’s search activity was making against how much the pre-revenue moonshots were burning through: it briefly became the world’s most valuable company. But a year in is a good moment to ask what it has achieved vis a vis these other two objectives. An indicative answer is provided by The FutureBrand Index, an annual exercise where thousands of people worldwide rate the world’s 100 largest listed companies across 18 attributes. The companies are then ranked according to how positively each is perceived. Alphabet had inherited Google’s listing but we threw in Google for good measure, to compare impressions. As an early verdict on Alphabet in brand strategy terms, the results are not encouraging. Whereas Google had topped the Index in previous years and would have done so again in 2016, Alphabet sank to position 21. Apple now moved up to occupy the first position, leading Alphabet even more emphatically in perception than in valuation terms. Further, people are projecting what they know of Google onto Alphabet because the perception profiles of both entities are very similar, ie they are both relatively stronger in the same attributes. However, what is particularly worrying is that Alphabet comes 25th in terms of the innovation attribute in isolation, when innovation is the very thing the restructure was designed to foster. In sum, it appears that people simultaneously struggle to distinguish Alphabet from its predecessor and are not as excited by it. This matters. Research by Weber Shandwick concluded that corporate brand is as important as product brand when it comes to purchase decisions. Buyers, whether businesses or consumers, take account of the reputations of parent companies. Further, our own research has demonstrated a correlation between positive perceptions and stock market out-performance over time. These factors, along with the need to be employers of choice, is why there has been so much effort on the part of ‘house of brands’ corporations such as P&G and Unilever to seek the advantages accruing to strong ‘master brand’ companies such as IBM, Nike and Apple. An enhanced profile resting on a clearly defined purpose that unites its otherwise disparate brands can be the right approach to position a parent company and its subsidiaries for future success. In fact, Google was well placed to pursue the master brand strategy, having accrued enormously positive associations and with several sister companies already sharing the Google name (eg Google X and Google Ideas, now ‘X’ and ‘Jigsaw’ respectively). But its founders opted instead for a new vehicle: a parent that stays out of the limelight to let its subsidiary brands shine. At the same time they willed it to be an enthusiasm-inducing and eminently investable proposition, only in the absence of a public interface and with no discernible push to shape perceptions. Looking ahead, any halo effect Alphabet enjoys as Google’s new incarnation will likely further wane. Moreover, allowing the view to persist that Alphabet is Google by another name surely runs counter to the founders’ intentions. That is why in entering year two it would serve Alphabet well to weave a compelling narrative beyond the financial one, that connects its burgeoning family of companies. A narrowly focused Google, shorn of cutting-edge activities, must for its part guard against becoming perceived as a mundane internet advertising company. The new name and company structure has created challenges when such a move is typically designed to resolve them, because of negative associations with a sector for example (think Philip Morris being reinvented as Altria). Google had no such problems in 2015 so we must wait to see if the move becomes a masterstroke or an unforced error. Because of the early uncertainty however, Alphabet only scores a B for its brand strategy.

But here’s a new idea -- the best ones are also marketers. They boost employer brand and improve the overall experience for employees. And when HR adopts marketing techniques, they can better manage talent. Here are the marketing principles every HR leader should incorporate: 1. Have a target audience. Marketers have a deep understanding of their audiences. They study demographics, attitudes and behaviors to create detailed customer personas and target messages to specific groups of people. Related: What HR Pros Need to Learn From the Rest of the Company HR can use the same strategy to better reach employees. After all, employees receive hundreds of emails every week -- yet 50 percent of those surveyed in theEMPLOYEEapp’s Mobile Trends in the Workplace survey said they still feel out of the loop. Why? Because the messages aren’t tapping into their interests. Start by learning everything about the employees targeted in the message. What motivates them? What are their goals? What do they value most? What are their concerns? What financial and non-financial “offers” will they respond to? How do these answers vary from department to department? Between managers and employees? Then, use this knowledge to target messages and HR programs to specific groups of employees, instead of sending generic information to everyone. For example, company announcements should look, feel and sound different depending on who the audience is -- different employees want different information in different ways. They want to know how it will affect them. How will it change their everyday work life? What’s in it for them? Let’s say the company is adding a new wellness program. The message to employees should outline the program and how it can benefit them. What are the rewards for participation? The message to team leaders, on the other hand, should outline ways to encourage their team to get involved. Think like a marketer to deliver the most relevant and important information to each employee. 2. Every channel. One brand voice. Marketers know that if they want to get the attention of their audience, they need to use more than one method. A campaign cannot be successful through emails and newsletters alone. Marketers use a mix of media to convey their messages. They use video, images, interactive websites, social media and more. In fact, the best marketing is viral -- it’s what other employees say about the programs. Related: A Comprehensive Guide to Building a Better Content Marketing Strategy And emails aren’t enough to reach employees. In theEMPLOYEEapp survey, 80 percent of employers said they use email to communicate, but 30 percent of employees said they ignore emails from their employer. According to Wrike’s 2016 Mobile Productivity Report, 90 percent of surveyed professionals believe a mobile device is critical to getting their jobs done. So use text messages, mobile apps, internal social networks and other mobile-optimized resources to communicate. Upload videos and pictures to engage employees in newsletters and announcements. Start a company blog and double down on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and other platforms employees use. The more ways employees can access and digest information, the better. But reaching everyone with a wide array of uncoordinated themes, benefits, colors, and tone seems scattered. Would P&G, Unilever, Disney or the best brand-builders in the world take a shotgun approach to building the value of their most important assets? Have a strategy and a voice, and have them show up in everything the company does. 3. Bring it all together. Marketers want to make the buying process easy for customers. And like marketers, HR wants employees to “buy” into programs, initiatives and benefits enrollment. It connects them to their work in broader ways. When HR focuses on a branded employee experience, encouraging program participation becomes easier. Bring all programs, initiatives and information together in one easy-to-use platform. Think of it as a hub that integrates the most important HR benefits, programs and initiatives in one convenient place. Employees don’t have to switch back and forth between multiple websites and keep track of information separately. When they can access everything in as few places as possible, participation becomes so much easier. And, in many cases, it’s much easier for employers to manage, too. 4. Measure effectiveness. Marketers track and measure everything to find the best strategies, adjust what isn’t working and get the most bang for their buck. Data is everything in modern marketing. Related: HR Analytics: How Should Big Data Be Used in the Workplace HR teams can also track and measure data to continually improve processes. Decide what metrics are most important to the company culture and overall business goals and track them to drive employee engagement. Are employees responding to messages? Are they getting the right messages at the right time? Are they participating in programs? Are they happy? What can be done better? Some new HR systems learn about people and take action so employers don’t even have to. HR isn’t an easy job. But when leaders look at it from a marketing perspective, HR strategies can improve the employee experience and build a consistent and strong employer brand.  Henry Albrecht Henry Albrecht is the CEO of Limeade, the corporate wellness technology company that measurably improves employee health, well-being and performance.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Jacob Bogage August 10 Follow jacobbogage Internet and advertising research firm ComScore shuffled its leadership team Wednesday, tapping company co-founder Gian Fulgoni as chief executive and naming a new chairman and chief financial officer. The changes come as the Reston, Va.-based firm has delayed reporting its financial results in the wake of an inquiry into its accounting practices. “The first half of 2016 was not business as usual for the company because of the distraction caused by the investigation,” Fulgoni said in a conference call Wednesday with analysts, according to a transcript. Fulgoni said the board agreed to put in place new leadership “that’s fully dedicated to operating the business with only minimal distraction.” ComScore, which specialized in measuring Internet and advertising traffic across computers, cellphones and other devices, began a probe in February into how it reported unspecified “nonmonetary revenue,” or transactions with no money attached. The company said co-founder Magid Abraham resigned as executive chairman last month to focus on his work as executive chairman of APX Labs and his work as a visiting scholar at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. (He remains on the ComScore board). On Wednesday, it said CEO Serge Matta would become executive vice chairman and become an adviser to Fulgoni. Former Procter & Gamble executive Joan M. Lewis was named chairman, and David Chemerow assumed the role of chief financial officer. The company said it would postpone financial reports until the conclusion of its in-house investigation. “The internal investigation is substantially complete, and the Audit Committee has identified certain areas of potential concern, including with respect to certain accounting and disclosure practices and controls that the Company, with input from its consultants and counsel, is further analyzing,” the company said in a filing Wednesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.   business business true Please provide a valid email address.

 16-year-old Laurie Hernandez winked at the judges before one of the biggest routines of her life Cork Gaines Aug. 9, 2016, 5:36 PM 41,306 facebook linkedin twitter email print Charlie Riedel/AP Laurie Hernandez may be the youngest member of the US women's gymnastics team, but that doesn't mean that the spotlight of the Rio Olympics is going to make her nervous. With the women's team cruising to their second-straight gold medal in the women's team all-around competition, Hernandez stepped up for her floor-exercise routine. Despite being just 16 and in her first Olympics, she took a moment to let the judges know that she was ready in a very confident way: She winked at them. NBCOlympics.com That wink is amazing. The little grin at the end is even better. Hernandez went on to score a 14.833 on the floor exercise, the highest score of the day up to that point. The women's team went on to win the gold by more than eight points, an enormous margin in a sport where scores are measured to the thousandth of a point. That's crazy. Amazingly, this is not the first time when one of the gymnasts had a memorable wink during a floor routine. During the P&G Gymnastics Championships in June, Simone Biles took a moment in the middle of her routine to wink at a teammate, as if to say, "It's good, I got this." Yes, @simonebiles we caught the wink ;) hahaha love it! Check out the full video on YouTube!

Say What!? Previous Brands Beat Generics Next How I Learned to Start Loving Social Media's Darkside Facebook's Panda Update So far this year publishers have lost 52% their Facebook distribution due to: increased ad load (another record quarter for Facebook!!!) shifting of the news feed "relevancy" algorithm toward friends promotion of new formats, like live video (if they subsidize it with direct payments, they're also algorithmically subsidizing its distribution) Instant Articles may have worked for an instant, but many publishers are likely where they were before they made the Faustian bargain, except they now have less control over their content distribution and advertising while having the higher cost structure of supporting another content format. When Facebook announced their news feed update to fight off clickbait headlines, it sure sounded a lot like the equivalent of Google's Panda update. Glenn Gabe is one of the sharpest guys in the SEO field who regularly publishes insightful content & doesn't blindly shill for the various platform monopolies dominating the online publishing industry & he had the same view I did. Wow, just realized this is a Panda-like Facebook algo update. "posts shared from domains & Pages will appear lower" https://t.co/IurVgPeL8D— Glenn Gabe (@glenngabe) August 4, 2016 Further cementing the "this is Panda" view was an AdAge article quoting some Facebook-reliant publishers. Glad we have already shifted our ways. Nice to see them moving in the same direction we are. etc. ... It felt like reading a Richard Rosenblatt quote in 2011 about Demand Media's strong working relationship with Google or how right after Panda their aggregate traffic level was flat. January 27, 2011 Peter Kafka: Do you think that Google post was directed at you in any way? Richard Rosenblatt: It’s not directed at us in any way. P K: they wrote this post, which talks about content farms, and even though you say they weren’t talking about you, it left a lot of people scratching their heads. R R: Let’s just say that we know what they’re trying to do. ... He’s talking about duplicate, non-original content. Every single piece of ours is original. ... our relationship is synergistic, and it’s a great partnership. May 9, 2011 Kara Swisher: What were you trying to communicate in the call, especially since investors seemed very focused on Panda? R R: What I also wanted to show was that third-party data sources should not be relied on. We did get affected, for sure. But I was not just being optimistic, we wanted to use that to really understand what we can do better. K S: Given Google’s shift in its algorithm, are you shifting your distribution, such as toward social and mobile? R R: If you look at where trends are going, that’s where we are going to be. K S: How are you changing the continued perception that Demand is a content farm? R R: I don’t think anyone has defined what a content farm is and I am not sure what it means either. We obviously don’t think we are a content farm and I am not sure we can counter every impact if some people think we are. A couple years later Richard Rosenblatt left the company. Since the Google Panda update eHow has removed millions of articles from their site. As a company they remain unprofitable a half-decade later & keep seeing YoY media ad revenue declines in the 30% to 40% range. Over-reliance on any platform allows that platform to kill you. And, in most cases, you are unlikely to be able to restore your former status until & unless you build influence via other traffic channels: I think in general, media companies have lost sight of building relationships with their end users that will bring them in directly, as opposed to just posting links on social networks and hoping people will click. I think publishers that do that are shooting themselves in the foot. Media companies in general are way too focused on being where our readers are, as opposed to being so necessary to our readers that they will seek us out. - Jessica Lessin, founder of TheInformation Recovering former status requires extra investment far above and beyond what led to the penalty. And if the core business model still has the same core problems there is no solution. "I feel pretty confident about the algorithm on Suite 101." - Matt Cutts Some big news publishers are trying to leverage video equivalents of a Narrative Science or Automated Insights (from Wochit and Wibbitz) to embed thousands of autogenerated autoplay videos in their articles daily. But is that a real long-term solution to turn the corner? Even if they see a short term pop in ad revenues by using some dumbed-down AI-enhanced low cost content, all that really does is teach people that they are a source of noise while increasing the number of web users who install ad blockers. And the whole time penalized publishers try to recover the old position of glory, the platform monopolies are boosting their AI skills in the background while they eat the playing field. The companies which run the primary ad networks can easily get around the ad blockers, but third party publishers can't. As the monopoly platforms broadly defund ad-based publishing, they can put users "in control" while speaking about taking the principle-based approach: “This isn’t motivated by inventory; it’s not an opportunity for Facebook from that perspective,” Mr. Bosworth said. “We’re doing it more for the principle of the thing. We want to help lead the discussion on this.” ... Mr. Bosworth said Facebook hasn't paid any ad-blocking software company to have its ads pass through their filters and that it doesn’t intend to. Google recently worked out a deal with Wikimedia to actually cite the source of the content shown in the search results: it hasn’t always been the easiest to see that the material came from Wikipedia while on mobile devices. At the Wikimedia Foundation, we’ve been working to change that. While the various platforms ride the edge on what is considered reasonable disclosure, regulatory bodies crack down on individuals participating on those platforms unless they are far more transparent than the platforms are: Users need to be clear when they're getting paid to promote something, and hashtags like #ad, #sp, #sponsored --common forms of identification-- are not always enough. The whole "eating the playing field" is a trend which is vastly under-reported, largely because almost everyone engaged in the ecosystem needs to sell they have some growth strategy. The reality is as the platform gets eaten it only gets harder to build a sustainable business. The mobile search interface is literally nothing but ads in most key categories. More ads. Larger ads. Nothing but ads. And a bit of scrape after the ads to ensure the second or third screen still shows zero organic results. @glenngabe those SERPs look even sexier when there are 3 or 4 AdWords above the knowledge graph. pic.twitter.com/tjdCuPBrCQ— aaron wall (@aaronwall) June 22, 2016 And more scraping, across more categories. Google monopolist not satisfied with above the fold they've now claimed "page 2" cc @kaufer #byeorganic pic.twitter.com/qGXmt2Z5K5— Jeremy Stoppelman (@jeremys) August 5, 2016 What's more, even large scaled companies in big money fields are struggling to monetize mobile users. On the most recent quarterly conference call TripAdvisor executives stated they monetize mobile users at about 30% the rate they monetize desktop or tablet users. What happens when the big brand advertisers stop believing in the narrative of the value of precise user tracking? We may soon find out: P&G two years ago tried targeting ads for its Febreze air freshener at pet owners and households with large families. The brand found that sales stagnated during the effort, but rose when the campaign on Facebook and elsewhere was expanded last March to include anyone over 18. ... P&G’s push to find broader reach with its advertising is also evident in the company’s recent increases in television spending. Toward the end of last year P&G began moving more money back into television, according to people familiar with the matter. For mobile to work well you need to be a destination & a habit. But there is tiny screen space and navigational searches are also re-routed through Google hosted content (which will, of course, get monetized). In fact, what would happen to an advertiser if they partnered with other advertisers to prevent brand bidding? Why that advertiser would get sued by the FTC for limiting user choice: The bidding agreements harm consumers, according to the complaint, by restraining competition for, and distorting the prices of, advertising in relevant online auctions, by reducing the number of relevant, useful, truthful and non-misleading advertisements, by restraining competition among online sellers of contact lenses, and in some cases, by resulting in consumers paying higher retail prices for contact lenses. If the above restraint of competition & market distortion is worth suing over, how exactly can Google make the mobile interface AMP exclusive without earning a similar lawsuit? AMP content presented in the both sections will be “de-duplicated” in order to avoid redundancies, Google says. The move is significant in that AMP results will now take up an entire phone screen, based on the example Google shows in its pitch deck. Are many publishers in a rush to support Google AMP after the bait-n-switch on Facebook Instant Articles?

Mark Zuckerberg’s social-networking giant said on Tuesday it will begin thwarting ad-blocking software on its site, escalating a battle between advertisers and users who are annoyed by ads. Facebook said that while it will protect ads from being blocked, it also is striving to make ads less annoying by making them more relevant and beneficial to users. “What we’ve heard is that people don’t like to see ads that are irrelevant to them or that disrupt or break their experience,” Andrew Bosworth, vice president of ads and business platform, wrote in a blog post. Accordingly, Facebook is introducing “tools to help people control their experience,” he said, by, for example, letting them opt out of seeing certain kinds of ads. Separately, Procter & Gamble told the Wall Street Journal Tuesday it is cutting back its use of targeted ads on Facebook, saying they weren’t effective. P&G added, however, that it isn’t reducing its overall ad spending on Facebook.

For representation purposes only. RELATED COMPANIES EXPAND ADD TO Portfolio Watchlist OUTLOOK? +ve -ve Unilever x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ In the mid to late 90s, desi denim brand Sunnex ran a campaign with the line 'Not Made in America. Thankfully'. Some ads struck an alarmist tone, for instance: 'If you were reading this on a New York street, you would be mugged by now.' While 'ahead of its time' is a phrase used by ad men to find excuses for a campaign that didn't work, there just might be some truth to it in this case. Especially for Sunnex, which when we last checked, was running a fairly vanilla campaign - both in its content and models' skin colour. There's no telling what a line like 'Not Made in America. Thankfully' may have done for the brand in 2016. A time when being national is at least as important as not being perceived as anti-national. These tensions have started to manifest in the world of brands. Consider Patanjali which ends its print ads with a "humble request" to consumers and store owners alike: "Give prominence to Patanjali products in your shops as well as in your hearts...Together we can turn the SWADESHI dream of Mahatma Gandhi, Bhagat Singh and Ram Prasad Bismil into a reality." The ads have been remarkably combative; and Patanjali has been quick to proclaim a multinational conspiracy in some of them being pulled up before the ASCI. Acharya Balakrishna, managing director has said, "We are not part of ASCI and so I don't fall under their purview." Patanjali's Balakrishna believe ASCI "Is run by MNCs...All these years, they destroyed our culture through different types of advertisements. They are the complainants and also the judge." Micromax's recent Angrezipanti ad features TV funny man Kapil Sharma. Except there's nothing particularly humorous about Sharma's tirade against linguistic snobbery. There are liberal references to the Prime Minister's penchant for speaking Hindi on his visits abroad and to countries like Japan, a global force to reckon with in spite of not being an English speaking nation. The ad drew its share of admirers and also a fair amount of flak from people who pointed out that the Indian mobile phone maker has Hugh Jackman on its roster and its recent Nuts, Guts, Glory film had all the racial diversity of a Ku Klux Klan rally. Shubajit Sen, CMO, Micromax however sees no contradiction and explains, "What binds the films together is the brand philosophy - we target consumers who punch above their weight, help them rise up and truly achieve their potential." Both ads are statements against prevailing attitudes of elitism and so not at all inconsistent. The latter ad is more in the area of national pride than outright jingoism, Sen adds. Others argue it's hard for brands and advertising to completely embrace these sentiments. According to Santosh Desai, MD and CEO, Future Brands, "You may see nationalism seep into tonality but a lot of what brands do is posturing: both on the liberal and the nationalistic side." However this world simply has far less of a license to go all out. As Desai puts it, "There's no way a P&G or a Unilever can get away with what Trump can get away with." However as the Aamir Khan-Snapdeal episode, recently mentioned by no less than defence minister Manohar Parrikar in a recent speech proves, a brand need not even be the one making or endorsing a statement, for it to be affected. A stray comment from an endorser can quickly become a lightning rod for the brand and its messaging to be subsumed by a vigorous, angry Indian nationalism. The sort that one sees an increasing amount of in online commentary, on television news shows and in the sort of posts people choose to believe in, share or dismiss outright. Desai admits, "In India, there's a certain ultra-nationalistic fervour with the anti-national label bandied about with a frequency that's unprecedented, if you have anything to say that is not all pointing in the same direction in an exultant manner." While comparisons to the Trump phenomenon may be far-fetched given the essential difference in political systems between the countries, Desai adds, "Formal democracy is only a small part of Indian reality. The same broad pattern is seen in the hyperbolic reactions, the characterisation and dismissal of individuals depending on which side of the fence they are on and in the cheapening and coarsening of language." Even brands that don't think they are playing this game are already in it, whether they like it or not. The choice is now whether they can (or ought to) try to control the narrative or live with the risk of extreme praise or blame, in spite of having done nothing to earn either.

The growth, or lack of it, sent shares tanking the day after the earnings call, but that's to be expected for a company in transition. Now investors will be looking to the new CEO to deliver investors to the promised land. Maxx Chatsko (TMFBlacknGold) Aug 9, 2016 at 6:14PM Image source: Flickr.fdecomite. Food and specialty ingredients manufacturer TerraVia (NASDAQ:TVIA) has been relatively quiet since changing its name and ticker symbol from Solazyme, which spawned the current technology platform and business relationship with joint-venture partner Bunge, in May. While investors may always want more news and updates, the self-induced quiet period was needed for the company to focus on its transition away from fuel and industrial markets toward higher value markets that are more likely to deliver capital-efficient growth sooner. Of course, the company did pick its head up for a brief time this week to discuss second-quarter earnings with shareholders. Growth was lackluster, but a new CEO was announced. Can investors pin their hopes on the new leader? By the numbers You can check the press release for the full financial details, but here are the important metrics for investors to focus on. Metric Q2 2016 Q2 2015 % Change Product revenue $6.3 million $8.3 million (24.1%) Algenist revenue* $5.5 million $5.2 million 5.7% Collaboration revenue $3.6 million $3.4 million 4.6% Total revenue $9.9 million $11.7 million (15.3%) Operating expenses $27.1 million $38.1 million (28.9%) Cash and cash equivalents $82.5 million $97.9 million (15.7%) Data source: TerraVia press release. *Included in product revenue. These numbers and year-over-year comparisons are a bit complicated for a couple of reasons that are worth understanding before panicking. First, the second quarter of last year includes product revenue from industrial products including fuels and drilling lubricants, while the most recent quarter does not. Second, the loss of industrial product revenue masks the relative strength of youthful food ingredient brands that grew nearly 200% in the comparison period. They grew from very small bases, but the growth is encouraging, given their new importance in TerraVia's future. Compared with the first half of 2015, during the first half of 2016 sales of food ingredients grew 170%, joint venture products grew 290%, industrials products slipped 80%, and Algenist remained flat. The turnaround won't happen overnight, but investors have little to complain about concerning the current strategy. Importantly, TerraVia continues to slash operating expenses, mostly from a major reduction in headcount at the end of 2015, and has a respectable amount of cash in the bank. But it's better than it seems. Not only do the aforementioned numbers not include a $20 million payment from Tengram for a majority interest (80%) in the company's cosmetic skincare line, Algenist, but going forward the company will avoid between $10 million and $15 million per year in marketing expenses related to the brand. That will help to further conserve cash and expand the company's runway before it needs to raise more funding for growth. Looking forward Some investors may be wondering why TerraVia parted ways with a majority stake in Algenist for only $20 million to Tengram. Isn't it a high-flying brand growing year after year? Doesn't the future potential represent revenue totals much greater than where the brand sits today? As always, it's a bit complicated, but the numbers have shown that Algenist was having problems growing for quite a few quarters. That's not to say that the brand is done growing, but whatever Solazyme/TerraVia was doing simply wasn't working. Image source: compiled by author, with data from SEC filings and TerraVia press release. Therefore, it simply made sense to sell 80% of the brand to a group that has the potential to continue growing it. Solazyme will still supply the key algae ingredients for Algenist products to Tengram, but that shouldn't amount to more than a few million dollars per year at current revenue levels. With Algenist on its way out, the most significant direct consumer brand now is Thrive culinary algae oil. Good news: Retail unit sales were up 200% in the second quarter, compared with the first quarter of 2016, while TerraVia is planning to expand the brand's retail footprint by 300% in the third quarter to more than 200 stores. Again, while the brand is growing from a very small base of revenue, it does appear to have traction. It's now the dominant cooking oil I use at home, but, admittedly, I'm far from a chef whose opinion holds sway. The most significant update from TerraVia was, of course, the announcement that the search for its next CEO was over. Co-founder, Chairman, and current CEO Jonathan Wolfson will step down at the end of August while retaining his role as chairman of the board. At that time, Apu Mody will become the new CEO. Mody's most recent position was president of Mars Food America, where he turned the North American region into the company's fastest-growing segment. He has also served in important roles at Del Monte Foods, Procter & Gamble, and the Grocery Manufacturers of America. Put another way, Mody has the experience and network needed to give TerraVia brands the exposure and opportunities required for growth. Those brands now include AlgaWise oils (a joint-venture product), AlgaVia whole algae ingredients, Thrive culinary oil, AlgaPrime DHA aquaculture and animal feed, and AlgaPur specialty ingredients. That's not a bad bunch to pin growth prospects on, although it certainly won't be easy. What does it mean for investors? TerraVia has a great portfolio of high-value food and specialty ingredients that could grow into a profitable, cash-generating company. It's important for investors to realize that the transition will take time -- as in several years -- and that even if the new company proves successful, the baggage of past mistakes does limit management's degrees of freedom. That could affect the decisions made to finance growth and the ability to acquire synergistic brands and technologies, and it could also result in dilution for existing shareholders. For now, it's simply too early to say how this will turn out. Maxx Chatsko has no position in any stocks mentioned. Follow him on Twitter to keep up with developments in the engineered biology field.

RELATED COMPANIES EXPAND ADD TO Portfolio Watchlist OUTLOOK? +ve -ve Tech Mahindra x Loading data... ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ BENGALURU: Men's grooming startup Bombay Shaving Company has raised Rs 4 crore ($600,000) in seed funding from a clutch of angel investors including McKinsey India MD Noshir Kaka, and Subramanian Ramadorai, an advisor to the prime minister, people aware of the development said. Other investors in the round included eleven McKinsey partners, Kiran Deshpande, former CEO of Tech Mahindra, Pankaj Gupta, Head of Operations of USL Diageo, Ravi Nigam, MD of Tasty Bite, and Maninder Gulati who heads strategy for Oyo. The 10-month-old internet first company is looking to tap the largely monopolised and growing Rs 3,991 crore ($600 million) men's grooming market with its differentiated six-part shaving regimen product range which it sells through a subscription model. "The two barriers to enter FMCG have lowered significantly," said Shantanu Deshpande, CEO at Bombay Shaving Company (BSC). "At scale marketing, which required deep pockets, could be replaced, to some extent, by efficient digital and social outreach and distribution networks could be replaced by 'direct-to-consumer' shipping." Founded by former McKinsey and GroupM employees earlier this year, the company is already averaging 400 orders a month, and plans to scale to about 30,000 orders a month in the next six months. "Other than the blades for which we have a partnership with Feather in Japan, we have designed and formulated every single element of the system," said Deshpande. "Once you buy, you can then subscribe to the blades and creams. The subscription is very flexible - you can choose your products, frequency of refill, pause/restart/cancel any time." The company's business model mirrors that of US-based Dollar Shave Club, which was sold to Unilever for $1 billion in cash earlier this year and gained popularity for coming up with new ways to sell consumer goods, largely without the overhead of brick-and-mortar stores. In India, men's grooming has gone mainstream and several FMCG majors like Unilever, Procter & Gamble, Beiersdorf and Emami are spending heavily to tap new consumers. BSC, which positions itself as a luxury brand, sells its six-set razor, brush, pre-shave scrub, shaving cream, post-shave balm and blades for Rs 2,995. The company has managed to tap suppliers of large FMCG companies largely by leveraging its investor connect. Deshpande, 29, founded BSC along with McKinsey colleague Deepu Panicker, Raunak Munot, former director of social strategy at GroupM, and Rohit Jaiswal, who worked at Crompton Greaves. It distinguishes itself with its proprietary tech in shaving blades. The company competes with large FMCG players as well as startups like LetsShave, which has partnered with US-based blades manufacturer Dorco to source its inventory.

The mutual fund folios in equity mutual funds are hitting new records. It seems like it is the last train leaving the town and everyone wants to be on board. I read a foreign brokerage report that says that our markets are ‘expensive’ relative to historic valuations. However, being a brokerage, it has to keep printing, “buy” ideas so that its investment banking business and corporate finance business do not suffer. So it hastens to add that our markets are not as expensive as some other ‘emerging’ markets in some global baskets. What is interesting to see is that most written off sectors seem to be back in favour. Commodities, finance, PSUs etc., are favoured. Even textiles, auto ancillaries and plastic fabricators seem to be headed to stratospheric valuations. The interesting thing is that globally, markets seem to be hot. Valuation rules are changed to justify higher and higher valuation for the unchanged earnings outlooks or potential. For example, we like to hear that GST will be a miracle boost for valuations. Pause. GST simply means higher or lower prices to everyone and competition will ensure that profitability is not abnormal for anyone. Retail or business prices will adjust to the new effective rate of taxation. Similarly, any company getting to even make a screwdriver that would be used by the defence sector gets a huge valuation kicker. Be cautious. While it may mean additional revenue for a few companies, by and large it would not mean a corresponding earnings growth. I could be wrong if the market re-rates the valuation for these companies, giving multiples that are patently not related to the fundamentals. It has happened. You have to look at valuation of stocks of companies like Gillette or P&G. One thing to focus on in this market is “liquidity”. In a bull market, you end up buying things easily. Check on the number of shareholders and the spread thereof. There are ‘hot’ mid-caps with less than 10,000 shareholders! What it means is that in a bull run, they will climb quickly. In a corrective phase, there would be only sellers and you will find it difficult to even sell 50 shares without taking a steep cut from the quoted price. Midcaps are by nature illiquid. One other thing that can be spotted is that volumes increase with price rise. Stocks, which hardly traded a few hundred shares a day, become actively traded once the price jumps up. These are classic signs of operator-driven action and often end up as poor stories. So what does one do in this market Have you heard of a concept called “drug holiday” Here is an extract from Wikipedia: “A drug holiday (sometimes also called a drug vacation is when a patient stops taking a medication(s) for a period of time; anywhere from a few days to many months or even years if they feel it is in their best interests. Plan-ned drug holidays are used in numerous fields of medicine. They are best known in HIV therapy.” Many of us are addicted to the stock markets. A break is strongly recommended. It will help one to conserve one’s resources. And also prevent us from building a ‘long term’ portfolio out of short-term trades that go wrong. Markets will find a reason to correct or stagnate for a long period of time, till the earnings catch up with valuation. Yes, liquidity can do strange things for continued periods of time, but then, the odds of making a great return from stocks keeps going down as valuations keep going up. It is time to exercise caution. Reduce exposure to equities. I am fairly sure that we will get better opportunities. After all, we surely have a window of anything from 20 to 40 years where one would be adding to the investment portfolio. And you do get five to 10 opportunities in that. Get “detoxified”. It is good for your financial health. Keep adding to knowledge. Make a list of what stocks you would like to own. Write a ‘buy’ price against it. Wait. The odds of making money to losing money in the stock markets at this juncture makes me content to stay on the sidelines.

The Bard himself stars in this new campaign, which started airing during the Olympics. He wants to get a certain Sarah to pay more attention to her dental health so she won’t have to stay home from school. Wait… One might assume that most high school/middle school kids would prefer to catch up on social media rather than discussing The Bard. Plus, there are so many film versions of Hamlet to choose from! But then Shakespeare’s work does have more than its share of sex and violence, and high school kids care more about grades and college admissions than anything else, right? Dennis Legault, the client’s North American oral health marketing director, told AdAge yesterday that kids “still miss school because of various dental things going on. So it is broadly affecting the population.” This will be a long-term effort for P&G, which wants to tie more of its marketing campaigns back to public good advocacy efforts like preventing kids from scoring lower on standardized tests because their teeth hurt. The work vaguely reminds us of Erich & Kallman’s historical, star-studded debut campaign for Chick-Fil-A. Michaelangelo would definitely need to brush his teeth after eating an egg and cheese sandwich in the Sistene Chapel, but we’re pretty sure they just gargled some water and called it a day in the 16th century. Dental care was pretty awful back then, BTW. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The PowerShares High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers Portfolio (NYSEArca: PEY) is one ETF that can position investors for years of consistent, dependable dividends. “PEY follows the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers Index, which selects companies based on a combination of dividend growth and yield. This ETF holds 50 companies with over 42% of the fund’s combined weight allocated to the utilities and energy sectors,” according to InvestorPlace. Dividend growers provide an aspect of quality and growth since these firms have a long track record of raising dividends. Related: Best of Both Worlds With This Dividend ETF Stocks with steady dividend yields reassure investors of a company’s strong financial health. Additionally, dividend-paying stocks typically outperform those that do not pay over the long haul, with less volatility, due to the compounding effect of dividends on the investment’s overall return. Over the past 40 years, companies that boost payouts have proven to be less volatile than their counterparts that cut, suspended or did not initiate or raise dividends. “In looking at some of the ETF’s top holdings it’s no surprise to find big telecom names like Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T), as well as tobacco plays like Altria Group (NYSE:MO) and smaller tobacco companies like Vector Group (NYSE:VGR). Sector-wise, utility stocks make up 20% of the overall ETF holdings, followed by financial services at 17%, and consumer-defensive stocks like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Kellogg (NYSE:K)and General Mills (NYSE:GIS), with that group making up 16% of the ETF’s overall holdings,” according to ETF Daily News.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Thursday November 24, 2016 News Business Larger / SmallerNight Mode CBA one of the most 'underowned' stocks in the world Patrick Commins 9 Aug 2016, 3:48 p.m. An analysis of the most 'crowded trades' highlights just how wary investors are of Australia's major banks - and Apple. CBA one of the most 'underowned' stocks in the world The most under-owned ASX stocks. The most over-owned ASX stocks. Professional fund managers are underweight the major banks. Photo: Warren Hackshall Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit Commonwealth Bank of Australia is the most under-owned stock on the ASX and the sixth most underweighted stock in the world. That data comes from UBS, which looked at the "most crowded trades" on the world's major bourses, or, in other words, which stocks fund managers, in aggregate, were most over- or underexposed to relative to the weighting of that name within its benchmark index. By this measure, Apple is the most underweighted stock in the world right now. "We sum up all the holdings in dollar value across all the active managers and calculate the weights of stocks in this active trading portfolio," the broker explained in a note to clients. "We then compare this weight with the relevant equity index benchmark to form the active weight." Our first chart shows that professional stock pickers are wary of the big banks in general, as well as BHP, supermarket owners Woolworths and Wesfarmers, Aurizon, AGL and AMP. Eight of those 10 names are in the ASX's top 20 stocks by market capitalisation, reflecting the fact that many professional stock pickers are looking to invest more money outside the blue-chip names, including a general uneasiness with the challenges facing the major lenders, despite the generous dividends on offer. The global top 10 in order from most to least underweight are: Apple, Exxon, AT&T, GE, Toyota, CBA, Nestle, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, and IBM. Analysis by Bank of America-Merrill Lynch suggested a contrarian approach to these so-called "crowded trades" has proved profitable in recent years. "The top 10 most overbought stocks have trailed the S&P for each of the past three years, while the top 10 'most neglected' stocks outperformed the S&P on average by 11.6 per cent," they wrote last month. At the other end of the scale is gold miner Newcrest, which earns the mantle of the most overbought stock on the ASX. Gold has outperformed just about every asset class this year, with the US dollar price of an ounce jumping 25 per cent in 2016 amid dwindling odds of an imminent US Fed rate hike and fresh monetary easing from most of the world's biggest central banks. Most overbought ASX stocks The most overbought stocks on the ASX look a pretty defensive, dividend-focused list, with Telstra the second most overweighted name, alongside a clutch of listed property trusts: Scentre Group, Westfield, Dexus and Vicinity Centres. Sydney Airport is in there, but not fellow infrastructure darling Transurban. Also are three global, industrial names – perhaps as investors bet on either a weaker Aussie dollar and/or improving global growth. These include Amcor, Brambles and James Hardie. Globally, the most overbought stocks are (in order): Amazon, United Health, Medtronic, Microsoft, Amgen, Alphabet, Visa, Texas Instruments, and Comcast. The story CBA one of the most 'underowned' stocks in the world first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

 Adblock Plus says Facebook's decision to block ad blockers is 'anti-user' Lara O'Reilly Aug. 10, 2016, 5:50 AM 6,124 facebook linkedin twitter email print Eyeo communications and operations manager Ben Williams. Adblock Plus Adblock Plus has reacted to the news that Facebook is going to prevent ad blocking software from working on its desktop site by accusing the social network of becoming "anti-user." Facebook announced Tuesday it was updating its tech to circumvent ad blocking software on its website. At the same time, Facebook said it will update its ad preferences tools to make it easier for individuals to tailor the types of ads that are served to them on the site.  Adblock Plus says the move "takes a dark path against user choice." Writing in a blog post entitled "Oh well, looks like Facebook just got all anti-user," Adblock Plus owner Eyeo's communications and operations manager Ben Williams pointed out that Facebook's own blog post announcing the changes says the primary reason people use ad blockers is to "stop annoying, disruptive ads." Williams says this shows there is good reason for consumers to download ad blockers and questions why, therefore, users are being prevented from deciding what they can and can't block. He continued: "In any case, it’s hard to imagine Facebook or the brands that are being advertised on its site getting any sort of value for their ad dollar here: publishers (like Facebook) alienate their audience and advertisers (the brands) allow their cherished brand name to be shoved down people’s throats. Yikes." Facebook first admitted it was starting to worry about ad blocker users back in January, highlighting in its annual 10-K filing that they have impacted its ad revenue "from time to time"  Meanwhile on Tuesday, Procter & Gamble, the world's largest ad spender, said it was cutting down on targeted Facebook ads. P&G chief marketing officer Marc Pritchard told The Wall Street Journal: ""We targeted too much and we went too narrow. And now we're looking at: What is the best way to get the most reach but also the right precision?" Update: On Thursday, Adblock Plus said users have figured out a workaround that will see its ad blocker (and others) work on Facebook's desktop site.

Say What!? Previous Reinventing SEO Next Brands Beat Generics Neofeudal Web Publishing Best Practices Guide At the abstract level, if many people believe in something then it will grow. The opposite is also true. And in a limitless, virtual world, you can not see what is not there. The Yahoo Directory Before I got into search, the Yahoo! Directory was so important to the field of search there were entire sessions at SES conferences on how to get listed & people would even recommend using #1AAA-widgets.com styled domains to alphaspam listings to the top of the category. The alphaspam technique was a carry over from yellow page directories - many of which have went through bankruptcy as attention & advertising shifted to the web. Go to visit the Yahoo! Directory today and you get either a server error, a security certificate warning, or a redirect to aabacosmallbusiness.com. Poof. It's gone. Before the Yahoo! Directory disappeared their quality standards were vastly diminished. As a webmaster who likes to test things, I tried submitting sites of various size and quality to different places. Some sites which would get rejected by some $10 directories were approved in the Yahoo! Directory. The Yahoo! Directory also had a somewhat weird setting where if you canceled a directory listing in the middle of the term they would often keep it listed for many years to come - for free. After many SEOs became fearful of links the directory saw vastly reduced rates of submissions & many existing listings canceled their subscriptions, thus leaving it as a service without much of a business model. DMOZ At one point Google's webmaster guidelines recommended submitting to DMOZ and the Yahoo! Directory, but that recommendation led to many lesser directories sprouting up & every few years Google would play a whack-a-mole game and strip PageRank or stop indexing many of them. Many have presumed DMOZ was on its last legs many times over the past decade. But on their 18th birthday they did a spiffy new redesign. Different sections of the site use different color coding and the design looks rather fresh and inviting. Take a look. However improved the design is, it is unlikely to reverse this ranking trend. Lacking Engagement Why did those rankings decline though? Was it because the sites suck? Or was it because the criteria to rank changed? If the sites were good for many years it is hard to believe the quality of the sites all declined drastically in parallel. What happened is as engagement metrics started getting folded in, sites that only point you to other sites become an unneeded step in the conversion funnel, in much the same way that Google scrubbed affiliates from the AdWords ecosystem as unneeded duplication. What is wrong with the user experience of a general web directory? There isn't any single factor, but a combination of them... the breadth of general directories means their depth must necessarily be limited. general directory category pages ranking in search results is like search results in search results. it isn't great from the user's perspective. if a user already knows a category well they would likely prefer to visit a destination site rather than a category page. if a user doesn't already know a category, then they would prefer to use an information source which prioritizes listing the best results first. the layout for most general web directories is a list of results which are typically in alphabetical order rather than displaying the best result first in order to sound authoritative many directories prefer to use a neutral tone If a directory mostly links to lower quality sites Google can choose to either not index it or not trust links from it. And even if a directory generally links to trustworthy sites, Google doesn't need to rank it to extract most the value from it. The trend of lower traffic to the top tier general directory sites has happened across the board. Many years ago Google's remote rater guidelines cited Joeant as a trustworthy directory. Their traffic chart looks like this. And the same sort of trend is true for BOTW, Business.com, GoGuides.org, etc. There is basically nothing a general web directory can do to rank well in Google on a sustainable basis, at least not in the English language. Even if you list every school in the city of Winnipeg that page can't rank if it isn't indexed & even if it is indexed it won't rank well if your site has a Panda-related ranking issue. There are a couple other issues with such a comprehensive page: each additional listing is more editorial content cost in terms of building the page AND maintaining the page the bigger the page gets the more a user needs something other than alphabetical order as a sort option the more listings there are in a tight category the more the likelihood there will be excessive keyword repetition on the page which could get the page flagged for algorithmic demotion, even if the publisher has no intent to spam. Simply listing things by their name will mean repeating a word like "school" over 100 times on the above linked Winnipeg schools page. If you don't consciously attempt to lower the count a page like that could have the term repeated over 300 times. Knock On Effects In addition to those web directories getting fewer paid submissions, most are likely seeing a rise in link removal requests. Google's "fear first" approach to relevancy has even led them to listing DMOZ as an unnatural link source in warning emails to webmasters. What's more, many people who use automated link clean up tools take the declining traffic charts & low rankings of the sites as proof that the links lack value or quality. That means anyone who gets hit by a penalty & ends up in warning messages not only ends up with less traffic while penalized, but they also get extra busy work to do while trying to fix whatever the core problem is. And in many cases fixing the core problem is simply unfeasible without a business model change. When general web directories are defunded it not only causes many of them to go away, but it also means other related sites and services disappear. Editors of those web directories who were paid to list quality sites for free. Web directory review sites. SEOs, internet marketers & other businesses which listed in those directories Now perhaps general web directories no longer really add much value to the web & they are largely unneeded. But there are other things which are disappearing in parallel which were certainly differentiated & valuable, though perhaps not profitable enough to maintain the "relevancy" footprint to compete in a brand-first search ecosystem. Depth vs Breadth Unless you are the default search engine (Google) or the default social network everyone is on (Facebook), you can't be all things to all people. If you want to be differentiated in a way that turns you into a destination you can't compete on a similar feature set because it is unlikely you will be able to pay as much for traffic-driven partnerships as the biggest players can. Can niche directories or vertical directories still rank well? Sure, why not. Sites like Yelp & TripAdvisor have succeeded in part by adding interactive elements which turned them into sought after destinations. Part of becoming a destination is intentionally going out of their way to *NOT* be neutral platforms. Consider how many times Yelp has been sued by businesses which claimed the sales team did or was going to manipulate the displayed reviews if the business did not buy ads. Users tend to trust those platforms precisely because other users may leave negative reviews & that (usually) offers something better than a neutral and objective editorial tone. And that user demand for those reviews, of course, is why Google stole reviews from those sorts of sites to try to prop up the Google local places pages. It was a point of differentiation which was strong enough that people wanted it over Google. So Google tried to neutralize the advantage. Blogs The above section is about general directories, but the same concept applies to almost any type of website. Consider blogs. A decade ago feed readers were commonplace, bloggers often cross-linked & bloggers largely drove the conversation which bubbled up through mainstream media. Google Reader killed off RSS feed readers by creating a fast, free & ad-free competitor. Then Google abruptly shut down Google Reader. Not only do whimsical blogs like Least Helpful or Cute Overload arbitrarily shut down, but people like Chris Pirillo who know tech well suggest blogging is (at least economically) dead. Many of the people who are quitting are not the dumb, the lazy, and the undifferentiated. Rather many are the wise trend-aware players who are highly differentiated yet find it impossible to make the numbers work: The conversation started when revenues were down, and I had to carry payroll for a month or two out of my personal account, which I had not had to do since shortly after we started this whole project. We tweaked some things (added an ad or two which we had stripped back for the redesign, reminded people about ad-blockers and their impact on our ability to turn a profit, etc.) and revenue went back up a bit, but for a hot minute, you’ll remember I was like: “Theoretically, if this industry went further into the ground which it most assuredly will, would we want to keep running the site as a vanity project? Probably not! We would just stop doing it.” In the current market Google can conduct a public relations campaign on a topic like payday loans, have their PR go viral & then if you mention "oh yeah, so Google is funding the creation of doorway pages to promote payday loans" it goes absolutely nowhere, even if you do it DURING THE NEWS CYCLE. So much of what exists is fake that anything new is evaluated from the perception of suspicion. While the real (and important) news stories go nowhere & the PR distortions spread virally, the individual blogger ends up feeling a bit soulless if they try to make ends meet: "The American Mama reached tens of thousands of readers monthly, and under that name I worked with hundreds of big name brands on sponsored campaigns. I am a member of virtually every ‘blog network’ and agency that “connects brands with bloggers”. ... What’s the point of having your own space to write if you’re being paid to sound like you work for a corporation? ... PR Friendly says “For the right price, I will be anyone you want me to be.” ... I’m not saying blogging is dying, but this specific little monster branch of it, sponsored content disguised as horribly written “day in the life” stories about your kids and pets? It can’t possibly last. Do you really want to be stuck on the inside when it crumbles?" If you can't get your own site to grow enough to matter then maybe it makes sense to contribute to someone else's to get your name out there. I recently received this unsolicited email: "Hello!

Thanks" That person was not actually a member of that site's team, but they had found a way to get their content published on it. In part because that sort of stuff exists, Google tries to minimize the ability for reputation to flow across sites. The large platforms are so smug, so arrogant, they actually state the following sort of crap in interviews: "There's a space in the world for art, but that's different from trying to build products at scale. The one thing that does make me a little nervous is a lot of my designer friends are still focused building websites and I'm not sure that's a growth business anymore. If you look at people who are doing interesting work, they tend to be building inside these platforms like Facebook and finding ways to do interesting work in there. For instance, journalists. Instant Articles is a really great way for stories to be told." Sure you can bust your ass to build up Facebook, but when their business model changes (bye social gaming companies, hello live streaming video) best of luck trying to follow them. And if you starve during the 7 lean years in between when your business model is once again well aligned with Facebook you can't go back in time to give yourself a meal to un-starve. Content Farms Ehow.com has removed *MILLIONS* of pages of content since getting hit by Panda. And yet their ranking chart looks like this What is crazy is the above chart actually understates the actual declines, because the shift of search to mobile & increasing prevalence of ads in the search results means estimates of organic search traffic may be overstated significantly compared to a few years prior. A half-decade ago a bootstrapped eHow competitor named ArticlesBase got some buzz in TechCrunch because they were making about $500,000 a month on about 20 million monthly unique visitors. That business was recently listed on Flippa. They are getting about a half-million unique monthly visitors (off 95%) and about $2,000 a month in revenues (off about 99.6%). The negative karma with that site (in terms of ability to rank) is so bad that the site owner suggested on Flippa to publish any new content from new authors onto different websites: "its not going to get to 0 as most of the traffic is not google today, but we would suggest to push out the fresh daily incoming content to new sites - thats where the growth is." Now a person could say "eHow deserves to die" and maybe they are right. BUT one could easily counter that point by noting... the public who owns the shares owns the ongoing losses & many top insiders cashed out long ago Google was getting a VIG on eHow on their ride up & is still collecting one on the way down (along with funding other current parallel projects from the very same people with the very same Google ad network) Demand Media's partner program where they syndicate eHow-like content to newspapers like USA Today keeps growing at 15% to 20% a year (similar process, author, content, business model, etc. ... only a different URL hosting the content) look at this and you'll see how many publishing networks are still building the same sort of content but are cross-marketing across networks of sites. What's more some of the same names are at the new plays. For example, Demand Media's founder was the chairman of an SEO firm bought by Hearst publishing & his wife is on the about us page of Evolve Media's ModernMom.com The wrappers around the content & masthead logos change, but by and large the people and strategies don't change anywhere near as quickly. Web Portals & News Sites As the mainstream media gets more desperate, they are more willing to partner with the likes of Demand Media to get any revenue they can. You see the reality of this desperation in the stock charts for newspaper companies. Or how about this chart for Yahoo.com. It doesn't look particularly bad, especially if you consider that Yahoo has shut down many of their vertical sites. Underlying flat search traffic charts misses declining publisher CPMs and the click traffic mix shift away from organic toward paid search channels as search traffic shifts to mobile devices & Google relentlessly increases the size of the search ads. Yahoo may still rank #3 for keyword x, but if that #3 ranking is below the fold on both mobile and desktop devices they might need to rank #1 to get as much traffic as #3 got a couple years ago. Yahoo! was once the leading search portal & now they are worth about 1/5th of LinkedIn (after backing out their equity stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo! Japan). The chart is roughly flat, but the company is up for a fire sale because organic search result displacement & the value of traffic has declined quicker than Yahoo! can fire employees & none of their Hail Mary passes worked. Ms. Mayer compared the [Polyvore] deal to Google’s acquisition of YouTube in 2006, arguing that “you can never overpay” for a company with the potential to land a huge new base of users. ... “Her core mistake was this belief that she could reinvent Yahoo,” says a former senior executive who left the company last year. “There was an element of her being a true believer when everyone else had stopped.” The same line of thinking was used to justify the Tumblr acquisition, which has went nowhere fast - just like their 50+ other acquisitions. Yahoo! shut down many verticals, fired many workers, sold off some real estate & is exploring selling their patents. Chewing Up the Value Chain Smaller devices that are harder to use means the gateways have to try to add more features to maintain relevance. As they add features, publishers get displaced: The Web will only expand into more aspects of our lives. It will continue to change every industry, every company, and every life on the planet. The Web we build today will be the foundation for generations to come. It’s crucial we get this right. Do we want the experiences of the next billion Web users to be defined by open values of transparency and choice, or the siloed and opaque convenience of the walled garden giants dominating today? And if converting on mobile is hard or inconvenient, many people will shift to the defaults they know & trust, thus choosing to buy on Amazon rather than a smaller ecommerce website. One of my friends who was in ecommerce for many years stated this ultimately ended up becoming the problem with his business. People would email him back and forth about the product, related questions, and basically go all the way through the sales process with getting him to answer every concern & recommend each additional related product needed, then at the end they would ask him to price match Amazon & if he couldn't they would then buy from Amazon. If he had more scale he might have been able to get a better price from suppliers and compete with Amazon on price, but his largest competitor who took out warehouse space also filed for bankruptcy because they were unable to make the interest payments on their loans. We live in a society which over-values ease-of-use & scale while under-valuing expertise. Look at how much consolidation there has been in the travel market since Google Flights launched & Google went pay-to-play with hotel search. Expedia owns Travelocity & Orbitz. Priceline owns Kayak. Yahoo! Travel simply disappeared. TripAdvisor is strong, but even they were once a part of Expedia. How different are the remaining OTAs? One could easily argue they are less differentiated than this article about the history of the travel industry makes Skift against other travel-related news sites. How many markets are strong enough to support the creation of that sort of featured editorial content? Not many. And most companies which can create that sort of in-depth content leverage the higher margins on shallower & cheaper content to pay for that highly differentiated featured content creation. But if the knowledge graph and new search features are simply displacing the result set the number of people who will be able to afford creating that in-depth featured content is only further diminished. Over 5 years ago Bing's Stefan Weitz mentioned they wanted to move search from a web of nouns to a web of verbs & to "look at the web as a digital representation of the physical world." Some platforms are more inclusive than Google is & decide to partner rather than displace, but Bing's partnership with Yelp or TripAdvisor doesn't help you if you are a direct competitor of Yelp or TripAdvisor, or if your business was heavily reliant on one of these other channels & you fall out of favor with them. Chewing Up Real Estate There are so many enhanced result features in the search results it is hard to even attempt to make an exhaustive list. As search portals rush to add features they also rush to grab real estate & outright displace the concept of "10 blue links." There has perhaps been nothing which captured the sentiment better than .@mattcutts I think I have spotted one, Matt. Note the similarities in the content text: pic.twitter.com/uHux3rK57f— dan barker (@danbarker) February 27, 2014 The following is paraphrased, but captures the intent to displace the value chain & the roll of publishers. "the journeys of users. their desire to be taken and sort of led and encouraged to proceed, especially on mobile devices (but I wouldn't say only on mobile devices). ... there are a lot of users who are happy to be provided with encouragement and leads to more and more interesting information and related, grouped in groups, leading lets say from food to restaurants, from restaurants to particular types of restaurants, from particular types of restaurants to locations of those types of restaurants, ordering, reservations. I'm kind of hungry, and in a few minutes you've either ordered food or booked a table. Or I'm kind of bored, and in a few minutes you've found a book to read or a film to watch, or some other discovery you are interested in." - Andrey Lipattsev What role do publishers have in the above process? Unpaid data sources used to train algorithms at Facebook & Google? Individually each of these assistive search feature roll outs may sound compelling, but ultimately they defund publishing. Looks like Symptom Cards will lead to additional, more-focused searches (& not to third party sites.) #seo pic.twitter.com/vhkz5ZflMJ— Glenn Gabe (@glenngabe) June 20, 2016 Not a "Google Only" Problem People may think I am unnecessarily harsh toward Google in my views, but this sort of shift is not a Google-only thing. It is something all the large online platforms are doing. I simply give Google more coverage because they have a history of setting standards & moving the market, whereas a player like Yahoo! is acting out of desperation to simply try to stay alive. The market capitalization of the companies reflect this. Google & Facebook control the ecosystem. Everyone else is just following along. "digital is eating legacy media, mobile is eating digital, and two companies, Facebook and Google, are eating mobile. ... Since 2011, desktop advertising has fallen by about 10 percent, according to Pew. Meanwhile mobile advertising has grown by a factor of 30 ... Facebook and Google, control half of net mobile ad revenue." - Derek Thompson The same sort of behavior is happening in China, where Google & Facebook are prohibited from competing. As publishers get displaced and defunded online platforms can literally buy the media: “There’s very little downside. Even if we lose money it won’t be material,” Alibaba's Mr. Tsai said. “But the upside [in buying SCMP] is quite interesting.” The above quote was on Alibaba buying the newspaper of record in Hong Kong. As bad as entire industries becoming token purchases may sound, that is the optimistic view. :D Facebook's Instant Articles and Google's AMP those make a token purchase unnecessary: "I don't think it's any secret that you're going to see a bloodbath in the next 12 months," Vice Media's Shane Smith said, referring to digital media and broadcast TV. "Facebook has bought two-thirds of the media companies out there without spending a dime." Those services can dictate what gets exposure, how it is monetized, and then adjust the exposure and revenue sharing over time to keep partners desperate & keep them hooked. “If Thiel and Nick Denton were just a couple of rich guys fighting over a 1st Amendment edge case, it wouldn't be very interesting. But Silicon Valley has unprecedented, monopolistic power over the future of journalism. So much power that its moral philosophy matters.” - Nate Silver Give them just enough (false) hope to stay partnered. All the while track user data more granularly & run AI against it to disintermediate & devalue partners. TV networks are aware of the risks of disintermediation and view Netflix with more suspicion than informed SEOs view Google: for all the original shows Netflix has underwritten, it remains dependent on the very networks that fear its potential to destroy their longtime business model in the way that internet competitors undermined the newspaper and music industries. Now that so many entertainment companies see it as an existential threat, the question is whether Netflix can continue to thrive in the new TV universe that it has brought into being. ... “ ‘Breaking Bad’ was 10 times more popular once it started streaming on Netflix.” - Michael Nathanson ... the networks couldn’t walk away from the company either. Many of them needed licensing fees from Netflix to make up for the revenue they were losing as traditional viewership shrank. And just like Netflix, Facebook will move into original content production. The Wiki Wikipedia is certainly imperfect, but it is also a large part of why other directories have went away. It is basically a directory tied to an encyclopedia which is free and easy to syndicate. Every large search & discovery platform has an incentive for Wikipedia to be as expansive as possible. The bigger Wikipedia gets, the more potential answers and features can be sourced from it. More knowledge graph, more instant answers, more organic result displacement, more time on site, more ad clicks. Even if a knowledge graph listing is wrong, the harm done by it doesn't harm the search service syndicating the content unless people create a big deal of the error. But if that happens then people will give feedback on how to fix the error & that is a PR lead into the narrative of how quickly search is improving and evolving. "Wikipedia used to instruct its authors to check if content could be dis-intermediated by a simple rewrite, as part of the criteria for whether an article should be added to wikipedia. There are many rascals on the Internets; none deserving of respect." - John Andrews Sergy Brin donates to fund the expansion of Wikipedia. Wikipedia rewrites more webmaster content. Google has more knowledge graph grist and rich answers to further displace publishers. I recently saw the new gray desktop search results Google is tested. When those appear the knowledge graph appears inline with the regular search results & even on my huge monitor the organic result set is below the fold. The problem with that is if your brand name is the same brand name that is in the knowledge graph & you are not the dominant interpretation then you are below the fold on all devices for your core brand UNLESS you pay Google for every single click. How much should a brand like The Book of Life pay Google for being a roadblock? What sort of tax is appropriate & reasonable? How high will you bid in a casino where the house readjusts the shuffle & deal order in the middle of the hand? I recently did a search on Bing & inside their organic search results they linked to a Mahalo-like page called Bing Knows. I guess this is a feature in China, but it could certainly spread to other markets. If they partnered with an eBay or Amazon.com and put a "buy now" button in the search results they'd have just about completely closed the loop there. Broad Commodification The reason I started this article with directories is their role is to link to sites. They are categorized collections of links which have been heavily commodified & devalued to the point they are rendered unnecessary and viewed adversely by much of the SEO market (even the ones with decent editorial standards). Just like links got devalued, so did domain names. And, as mentioned above in the parts about blogging, content farms, web portals & news sites ... the same trend is happening to almost every type of content. Online ad revenues are still growing quickly, but they are not flowing through to old media & many former leading bloggers consider blogging dead. Big platform players like Google and Facebook broaden cross-device user tracking to create new relevancy signals and extract most the value created by publisher. The more information the platform owns the more of a starving artist the partners become. As partners become more desperate, they overvalue growth (just like Yahoo! with Polyvore): "It's the golden age right now," [Thrillist CEO Ben Lerer] said. "If you're a digital publisher, you have every big TV company calling you. When I look at media brands, if a media brand disappeared tomorrow, would I notice?" he said. "And there are a bunch of brands that have scale, and maybe a lot of money raised, and maybe this and that, but, actually, I might not know for a year. There's so many brands like that. Like, what does it really stand for? Why does it exist?" Disruption is not a strategy, but the whole point of accelerating it & pushing it (without an adequate plan for "what's next") is to re-establish feudal lords. The web is a virtual land where the commodity which matters most is attention. If you go back in time, lords maintained wealth & control through extracting rents. A few years ago a quote like the following one may have sounded bizarre or out of place These are the people who guard the company’s status as what ranking team head Amit Singhal often sees characterised as “the biggest kingmaker on this Earth.” But if you view it through the some historical context it isn't hard to understand "The nobles still had the power to write the law, and in a series of moves that took place in different countries at different times, they taxed the bazaar, broke up the guilds, outlawed local currencies, and bestowed monopoly charters on their favorite merchants. ... It was never really about efficiency anyway; industrialization was about restoring the power of those at the top by minimizing the value and price of human laborers." - Douglas Rushkoff Google funding LendUp & ranking their doorway pages while hitting the rest of the industry is Google bestowing "monopoly charters on their favorite merchants." Headwinds The issue is not that the value of anything drops to zero, but rather a combine set of factors shrinks down the size of the market which can be profitably served. Each of these factors eat at margins... lower CPMs the rise of ad blockers (funded largely by some big ad networks paying to allow their own ads through while blocking competing ad networks) rise of programmatic ads (which shift advertiser budget away from publisher to various forms of management) larger ad sizes: "Based on early testing, some advertisers have reported increases in clickthrough rates of up to 20% compared to current text ads. " increase of vertical search results in Google & more ads + self-hosted content in Facebook's feed shift of search audience to mobile devices which have no screen real estate for organic search results and lower cost per click (there's a reason Google AdSense is publishing tips on making more from mobile) increased algorithmic barrier to entry and longer delay times to rank The least sexy consultant pitch in the world: "Sure I can probably rank your website, but it will take a year or two, cost you at least $80,000 per year, and you will still be below the fold even if we get to #1 because the paid search ads fill up the first screen of results." That isn't going to be an appealing marketing message for a new small business with a limited budget. The Formula “The open web is pretty broken. ... Railroad, electricity, cable, telephone—all followed this similar pattern toward closedness and monopoly, and government regulated or not, it tends to happen because of the power of network effects and the economies of scale” - Ev Williams. The above article profiling Ev Williams also states: "An April report from the web-analytics company Parse.ly found that Google and Facebook, just two companies, send more than 80 percent of all traffic to news sites." The same general trend is happening to almost every form of content - video, news, social, etc.. a big platform over-promotes a vertical to speed up buy-in (perhaps even offering above market rates or other forms of compensation to get the flywheel started) other sources join the market without that compensation & then the compensation stream gets yanked displacement of the source by a watered down copy (eHow or Wikipedia styled rewrite), or some zero-cost licensing arrangement (Facebook Instant Articles, Google AMP, syndicating Wikipedia rewrites) strategic defunding of the content source promise of future gains causing desperate publishers to lean harder into Google or Facebook even as they squeeze more water out of the rock. Hey, sure your traffic is declining & your revenue is declining faster. You are getting squeezed out, but if you trust the primary players responsible for the shift & rely on Instant Articles or Google's AMP this time will be different. ...or maybe not... Facts & Opinions When I saw some Google shills syndicating Google's "you can't copyright facts" pitch without question I cringed, because I knew where that was immediately headed. A year later the trend was obvious. The Internet commoditized the distribution of facts. The "news" media responded by pivoting wholesale into opinions and entertainment.— Naval Ravikant (@naval) May 26, 2016 So now we get story pitches where the author tries to collect a few quote sources to match the narrative already in their head. Surely this has gone on for a long time, but it has rarely been so transparently obvious and cringeworthy as it is today. How modern journalism works pic.twitter.com/i2CRnwAWZy— Nick Cohen (@NickCohen4) June 15, 2016 And if you stray too far from facts into opinions & are successful, don't be surprised if you end up on the receiving end of proxy lawsuits: Can we talk about how strange it is for a group of Silicon Valley startup mentors to embrace secret proxy litigation as a business tactic? To suddenly get sanctimonious about what is published on the internet and called News? To shame another internet company for not following ‘the norms’ of a legacy industry? The hypocrisy is mind bending. The desperation is so bad news sites don't even attempt to hide it. And part of what is driving that is bot-driven content further eroding margins on legitimate publishing. Google not only ranks those advertorials, but they also promote some of the auto-generated articles which read like: As many as 1 analysts, the annual sales target for company name, Inc. (NYSE:ticker) stands at $45.13 and the median is $45.13 for the period closed 3. The bearish target on sales is $45.13 and the bullish estimate is $45.13, yielding a standard deviation of 1.276%. Not more than 1 investment entities have updated sales projections on upside over the last week while 1 have downgraded their previously provided sales targets. The estimates highlight a net change of 0% over the last 1 weeks period. Sales estimated amount is a foremost parameter in judging a firm’s performance. Nearly 1 analysts have revised sales number on the upside in last one month and 1 have lowered their targets. It demonstrates a net cumulative change of 0% in targets against sales forecasts which were given a month ago. In latest quarterly period, 1 have revised targeted sales on upside and 1 have decreased their projections. It demonstrates change of 4.898%. I changed a few words in each sentence of that quote to make it harder to find the source as I wasn't trying to out them specifically. But the auto-generated content was ranked by Google & monetized via inline Google AdSense ads promoting the best marijuana stocks to invest in and warning of a pending 80% stock market crash coming soon this year. Hey at least it isn't a TOTALLY fake story! Publishers get the message loud and clear. Tronc wants to ramp up on AI driven video content at scale: "There's all these really new, fun features we're going to be able to do with artificial intelligence and content to make videos faster," Ferro told interviewer Andrew Ross Sorkin. "Right now, we're doing a couple hundred videos a day; we think we should be doing 2,000 videos a day." All is well, news & information are just externalities to a search engine ad network. No big deal. "With newspapers dying, I worry about the future of the republic. We don’t know yet what’s going to replace them, but we do already know it’s going to be bad." - Charlie Munger Build a Brand Build a brand, that way you are protected from the rapacious tech platforms. Or so the thinking goes. But that leads back to the above image where The Book of Life is below the fold on their own branded search query because there is another interpretation Google feels is more dominant. The big problem with "brand as solution" is you not only have to pay to build a brand, but then you have to pay to protect it. And the number of search "innovations" to try to siphon off some late funnel branded traffic and move it back up the funnel to competitors (to force the brand to pay again for their own brand to try to displace the "innovations") will only continue growing. And at any point in time if Disney makes a movie using your brand name as the name of the movie, you are irrelevant and need of a rebrand overnight, unless you commit to paying Google for your brand forever. Having an offline location can be a point of strength and a point of differentiation. But it can also be a reason for Google to re-route user traffic through more Google owned & controlled pages. Further, most large US offline retailers are doing horrible. Almost all the offline growth is in stores selling dirt cheap unbranded imported stuff like Dollar General or Family Dollar & stores like Ross and TJ Maxx which sell branded item remainders at discount prices. And as Amazon gets more efficient by the day, other competitors with high cost structures & less efficient operations grow relatively less efficient over time. The Wall Street Journal recently published an article about a rift between Wal-Mart & Procter & Gamble: “They sell crappy private label, so you buy Swiffer with a crappy refill,” said one of the people familiar with the product changes. “And then you don’t buy again.” In trying to drive sales growth, P&G is resorting to some Yahoo!-like desperate measures, included meetings where "Some workers donned gladiator-like armor for the occasion." Riding on other platforms or partners carries the same sorts of risks as trusting Google or Facebook too much. Even owning a strong brand name and offline distribution does not guarantee success. Sears already spun out their real estate & they are looking to sell the Kenmore & Craftsman brands. The big difference between the web and offline platforms is the marginal cost of information is zero, so they can quickly & cheaply spread to adjacent markets in ways that physically constrained offline players can not & some of the big web platforms have far more data on people than governments do. It is worth noting one of the things that came out of the Snowden leaks is spooks were leveraging Google's DoubleClick cookies for tracking users. As desperate stores/platforms see slowing growth they squeeze for margins and seek to accelerate growth any way possible. Chasing growth ultimately leads to the promise of what differentiates them disappearing. I recently bought some "hand crafted" soaps on Etsy, which shipped from Shenzen. I am not sure how that impacts other artisinal soap sellers, but it makes me less likely to buy that sort of product from Etsy again. And for as much as I like shopping on Amazon, I was uninspired when a seller recently sent me this. Amazon might usually be great for buyers & great for affiliates, but hearing how they are quickly expanding their private label offerings wouldn't be welcome news for a merchant who is overly-reliant on them for sales in any of those categories. The above sort of activity is what is going on in the real world even among brands which are not under attack. The domestic economic landscape is getting quite ugly: America’s economy today is in some respects more concentrated than it was during the Gilded Age, whose excesses prompted the Progressive Era reforms the FTC exemplifies. In sector after sector, from semiconductors and cable providers to eyeglass manufacturers and hotels, a handful of companies dominate. These giants use their market power to hike prices for consumers and suppress wages for workers, worsening inequality. Consolidation also appears to be driving a dramatic decline in entrepreneurship, closing off opportunity and suppressing growth. Concentration of economic power, in turn, tends to concentrate political power, which incumbents use to sway policies in their favor, further entrenching their dominance. And the local abusive tech monopolies are now firmly promoting the TPP: "make it more difficult for TPP countries to block Internet sites" = countries should have less influence over the web than individual Facebook or Google engineers do. In a land of algorithmic false positives that cause personal meltdowns and organizational breakdowns there is nothing wrong at all with that! I kept waiting. For a year and a half, I waited. The revenues kept trickling down. It was this long terrible process, losing half overnight but then also roughly 3% a month for a year and a half after. It got to the point where we couldn’t pay our bills. That’s when I reached out again to Matt Cutts, “Things never got better.” He was like, “What, really? I’m sorry.” He looked into it and was like, “Oh yeah, it never reversed. It should have. You were accidentally put in the bad pile.” Luckily the world can depend on China to drive growth and it will save us. Or maybe there is a small problem with that line of thinking... Beijing’s intellectual property regulator has ordered Apple Inc. to stop sales of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in the city, ruling that the design is too similar to a Chinese phone, in another setback for the company in a key overseas market. Can any experts chime in on this? Let's see... First, there is Wal-Mart selling off their Chinese e-commerce operation to the #2 Chinese ecommerce company & then there's this from the top Chinese ecommerce company: “The problem is the fake products today are of better quality and better price than the real names. They are exactly the same factories, exactly the same raw materials but they do not use the names.” - Alibaba's Jack Ma Published: June 20, 2016 by Aaron Wall in publishing & media Previous Reinventing SEO Next Brands Beat Generics New to the site?

Photo: Reuters Are the recent acquisitions of Monster Worldwide Inc. by Randstad Holding NV and of Jet.com by Wal-Mart the last roar of the old economy? The two deals coming within days of each other continue a trend of acquisitions by large old economy companies of start-ups from the digital world. Thus, last month Verizon Inc. bought Yahoo! Inc., a year after it acquired the former America Online for $4.4 billion. Last January, Capital One acquired San Francisco-based money management app, Level Money, and in January 2013, Avis Budget Group Inc. bought Zipcar which changed the car rental business with its hourly rentals plans. In December 2011, health insurance giant Aetna acquired mobile health startup, Healthagen, the developer of the popular health app iTriage. Much like Verizon and Aetna, the 56-year old Randstad Holding NV, a Dutch multinational, has been a global leader in its business. While Monster’s bread and butter and mainstay is its website, Randstad focuses on recruitment centres. It has some 4,500 branches. Wal-Mart is, of course, a global behemoth, the largest company in the world by sales. By contrast, the companies they have acquired are products of the digital age, whose promise often exceeded their performance. Both Monster and Jet.com had reached the end of the road. A day before the announcement of the acquisition, Monster reported a net loss in the second quarter of $124.2 million. One of the pioneers of the new economy, the company has seen its fortunes plummet over the years. Its stock peaked at more than $86 a share at the height of the Internet bubble in March 2000, valuing the company at almost $8.4 billion. From there to a valuation of $429 million, the price which Randstad paid, is the story of many digital start-ups that left it too late. These acquisitions mark the coming together of two intersecting currents. Start-ups who have lost their way and are either running out of cash or simply out of momentum and see no future are putting themselves up for adoption. And old economy giants petrified by the changes around them and fearful of being left behind in the new digital world are using their last weapons—their vast cash hoards—to buy them up, often to the bafflement of outsiders.

Wal-Mart’s move also comes at a time when Amazon is pushing the boundaries of technology in retailing by developing artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted shopping. Jet’s acquisition still doesn’t get Wal-Mart anything resembling Amazon’s Alexa AI which is its equivalent of a digital shopping assistant. In fact, all the major computing platforms from Microsoft, Google and Apple have some form of voice-activated AI assistant with search capability. There is thus a touch of desperation in the Bentonville-based giant’s purchase of Jet.com. Its revenues are stagnating—down at -0.7% for its year ending March 2016, while operating income declined by 11% in the same period. By contrast, Amazon’s Q2 revenue was up 31% y-o-y while operating income was up 180% to $1.3 billion. Bit players like Jet.com have increasingly got left behind in the winner-takes-all world of digital services. Wall Street Journal reported that Procter & Gamble Co., the world’s biggest advertising spender, in a rejig of its digital advertising strategy, is scaling back spends on smaller websites that lack the reach of sites such as Facebook, Google and YouTube. That has meant a rash of new-economy start-ups available for a song. And large, old economy companies are past masters at beating down such acquisition targets. But whether buying a start-up when its descent down the cliff has already started, is such a great idea, no matter the cost, is open to debate.

(Photo: The Enquirer/Carrie Cochran)Buy Photo ERLANGER – L'Oreal plans to build the largest solar energy installation by a private company in Kentucky at its Florence manufacturing plant, local company officials said Tuesday. And given the prevalence and importance of coal mining in the Bluegrass State, the venture is bold. "The value of sustainability, from a L'Oreal standpoint, is non-negotiable," said Eric Wolff, vice president of the beauty company's manufacturing operations. Wolff said the project, where contract negotiations are still ongoing, is the biggest undertaking of its type in the company's history. The Florence plant is one of several manufacturing operations the France-based maker of cosmetics, skincare, and haircare products has in the United States. Wolff and representatives from Mazak Corp., Balluff Inc. and Celanese Corp. joined in a discussion Tuesday to talk about the future of manufacturing in the region. The discussion was part of the Northern Kentucky Chamber of Commerce's Eggs 'N Issues breakfast event. In Boone, Kenton and Campbell counties, more than 20,000 workers are involved in manufacturing, which accounts for about 58 percent of the region's total workforce, according to Daniel Tobergte, president and CEO of Northern Kentucky Tri-County Economic Development Corp. In the past five years, the region has seen 74 companies expand or relocate here, accounting for $950 million in capital investments, Tobergte said. Average manufacturing salaries tend to be higher than non-manufacturing jobs: $59,500 annually for manufacturing versus $44,500 annually for all other jobs. Here are some of the issues that the manufacturing executives said are faced by their companies: Sustainability  L'Oreal has developed a company-wide plan to reduce its carbon footprint by 60 percent by 2020. About six months after the solar panel installation is complete, the company will be able to generate 1.5 megawatts of electricity annually to power its plant "It will require a significant amount of work on our part," Wolff said. "We are committed to reducing" our impact on the environment. Keeping up with technology After Mazak completed a $30 million expansion project, which included adding $19 million of new equipment, company leaders found that new and older technologies "speak different languages," said Ben Schawe, vice president of manufacturing. "Our challenge now is communication between the equipment," he said. The company has started to collaborate with tech firm Cisco Systems to prevent hackers from infiltrating Mazak's equipment, as well as implementing new ways to get equipment to "speak to each other." Working against lower energy prices As energy prices have dipped over the last few years, Chuck Thomas, site manager at chemicals company Celanese, said capital projects have been put on hold. "Our period for cost-reduction projects has extended," Thomas said. "The cost of everything has decreased and that is a challenge for us now." Finding a skilled workforce "Manufacturing is considered a dirty word to some people," said Thomas, adding that perceptions of the industry are largely what keep people from pursuing jobs in manufacturing. "That's contrary today to what manufacturing really is – it's not an office environment and it's not easy. But it's a field where employers make sure workers are safe and successful." Getting young people interested in manufacturing is not easy, Schawe said. Part of the problem is getting parents to encourage their children to enter the field, he said. Mazak is combating the issue by working with area schools and inviting parents on the weekends to its shop floor. Fighting new competition With Procter & Gamble's high-profile brand-shedding efforts in the beauty sector, :L'Oreal's Wolff said "we're a shark in the ocean surrounded by piranhas." He said the company's new competition is retailer Amazon, which is "changing our world and every competitor we have is highly competitive and reactive to the market." 8 CONNECTTWEET 16 LINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2bd3MUH TOP VIDEOS Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 22 17:46 Joe Deters asks for retrial of Ray Tensing, seeks change of venue 3:07 Black Friday secrets the stores don't want you to know 1:01 Finding home: A 12-year-old boy's search in the midst of war 6:41 Bills-Bengals postgame wrap 3:10 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59 Jobs Report FedEx is set to hire 500 workers in Greater Cincinnati for the holidays Fatima Hussein Ohio, Ky. and other states challenge US on OT rule Fatima Hussein Cincinnati region's jobless rate steady in August Fatima Hussein Ohio unemployment rate rises as state loses jobs Fatima Hussein Kentucky employment dips slightly in August Fatima Hussein Burger King, Popeyes franchisee hiring 500 workers Fatima Hussein This story is part of Jobs Report FedEx is set to hire 500 workers in Greater Cincinnati for the holidays Ohio, Ky. and other states challenge US on OT rule Cincinnati region's jobless rate steady in August
