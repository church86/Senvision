View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160819005283/en/ Photo courtesy of Procter & Gamble WHO:   Families, individuals and first responders in need of personal care items, cleaning products or laundry services in the wake of the recent historic flooding in Louisiana.   WHAT: The Tide Loads of Hope fleet will be deployed to support the relief efforts in Louisiana. The early-responder Tide Loads of Hope mobile laundry vehicle will be the first to arrive and will begin laundry services on August 19th, providing free full-service laundry to residents in Louisiana affected by the recent flooding. Residents can bring clothes (up to two loads per household) to the mobile unit to be washed, dried and folded free of charge for those in the directly affected areas. All washable clothing types can be accepted with the exception of heavy bedding. In addition, P&G will also be providing personal care kits containing items such as Secret deodorant, Crest toothpaste and Pantene shampoo as well as household cleaning products like Bounty, Mr. Clean and Swiffer. The extended capacity semi-truck is also en route to support relief efforts and will be on location next week with date and location to-be-determined. For the most up-to-date information on the fleet’s location and timing, please visit Tide’s Facebook and Twitter channels at https://www.facebook.com/Tide or @Tide.   WHY: Historic storms hit southern Louisiana and Mississippi between August 10th and 13th, devastating thousands of families and homes. As many residents have been forced from their homes, they are currently without basic needs and resources. P&G has a history of giving back to the communities where we live and work, and we wanted to provide some everyday essentials to those who need it most. These services are free and available to people affected by the disaster and the volunteers that are helping to respond.   WHERE: The early-responder Tide Loads of Hope mobile laundry unit will be located at:   Bethany Church South Campus 10877 Reiger Road, Baton Rouge, LA 70809   P&G products will be distributed directly to residents in this area as well as from the Bethany Church South Campus location.

Stay tuned for the location of the extended capacity semi-truck which will be able to accommodate 300 loads of laundry per day (two loads per household).   ABOUT TIDE LOADS OF HOPE: In 2005, P&G launched Tide Loads of Hope to provide much needed laundry services to families affected by Hurricane Katrina. Since that time, Tide Loads of Hope has washed more than 60,000 loads of laundry for more than 45,000 families impacted by disasters around the world. The early-responder Tide Loads of Hope mobile laundry unit is outfitted with 12 high-efficiency Whirlpool Duet washers and dryers (six of each) with the capacity to do up to 100 loads of laundry a day. The extended capacity semi-truck is outfitted with 32 energy-efficient Whirlpool washers (16 of each) with the capacity to do up to 300 loads of laundry a day.   BRANDS: Brands included in relief effort: Always, Bounty, Crest, Charmin, Dawn, Febreze, Ivory, Gillette, Mr. Clean, Old Spice, Oral-B, Pampers, Pantene, Secret, Swiffer, Tide, and Venus.   PARTNER: P&G provides these services in partnership with Matthew 25: Ministries, an international humanitarian aid and disaster relief organization.

P&G has one less billion-dollar brand Alexander Coolidge , acoolidge@enquirer.com 2:07 p.m. EDT August 19, 2016 An overseas ad for Prestobarba. (Photo: Provided) Procter & Gamble is blaming currency woes for cutting one of its billion-dollar brands from that elite roster. Prestobarba, a disposable razor brand sold in Latin America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East, saw fiscal year sales dip below 10 digits, company officials said. The slump means the Cincinnati-based consumer products giant now has 20 billion-dollar brands, compared with 22 a year ago. For the first time in years, P&G has stopped listing its "billion-dollar brands" in its annual 10-K report to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Instead, it lists 32 "major brands" with sales north of $500 million. Prestobarba remains a "major" brand by that definition. Company officials acknowledged the classification changes when asked this week. Another billion-dollar brand, hair color Wella, has also been removed from its billion-dollar list because it is part of the pending $15 billion divestiture to New York-based Coty, which is acquiring 40 P&G beauty brands this fall. Prestobarba became a billion-dollar P&G brand in 2013 – becoming the company's second brand sold all or mostly overseas to hit 10 digits as international sales continued to fuel Procter's growth. The first was high-end skin care brand SK II, which sells in U.S. department stores, but started as an Asian blockbuster. But plummeting currency values across the globe have sapped P&G's revenues, costing the company $4.2 billion in lost sales in the fiscal year that ended June 30. Central banks in overseas markets have devalued their money against the U.S. dollar to prop up exports and boost their local economies. However, countries that do that inflict higher domestic inflation for local consumers, which hurts demand. It also increases the cost of doing business in those countries. What sales are finally booked are converted to fewer dollars. The last P&G brand to fall off the billion-dollar list was Braun electric razors three years ago after the company sold off part of the business, exiting the kitchen gadgets business. Braun and Prestobarba are now called "leadership brands" with sales between $500 million and $1 billion. P&G's other leadership brands are shampoo brand Rejoice, sold in Asia; Old Spice men's deodorant; Safeguard soap; Prilosec OTC heartburn medication; Cascade dishwashing detergent; Venus razors; Mr. Clean household cleaner; Swiffer dust mops; Luvs diapers; and Tampax tampons. P&G's remaining billion-dollar brands are Always pantyliners; Ariel, Gain and Tide laundry detergents; Bounty paper towels; Charmin toilet paper; Crest toothpaste; Dawn dish soap; Downy fabric softener; Febreze fabric and air freshener; Fusion, Gillette and Mach3 razors; Head & Shoulders and Pantene shampoos; Olay and SK-II skin care; Oral-B toothbrushes; Pampers diapers; and Vicks cough medicine. 5 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2bHIjnn TOP VIDEOS Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 22 17:46 Joe Deters asks for retrial of Ray Tensing, seeks change of venue 3:07 Black Friday secrets the stores don't want you to know 1:01 Finding home: A 12-year-old boy's search in the midst of war 6:41 Bills-Bengals postgame wrap 3:10 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Aug 19, 2016 at 8:10AM Image source: Getty Images. Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) closed out its fiscal 2016 on an upbeat note, having managed just its second improvement in organic sales growth in nearly three years. The consumer goods giant also booked encouraging volume gains in each of its five key product divisions. However, P&G came up far short in two of its fundamental business goals over the past 12 months. And unless it can turn the tide on these metrics, the stock is likely to underperform the market from here. The retailer's competitive strategy is simple: Use a deep portfolio of blockbuster brands -- in combination with a world-class selling infrastructure -- to deliver increasing returns to shareholders. There are three financial metrics that form the foundation for that lucrative model: organic sales, profits, and cash flow. As executives explain in the 10-K report, P&G aims to 1) improve sales at above-market growth rates; 2) generate high-single-digit earnings gains; and 3) produce free cash flow that's at least 90% of adjusted profits. The company didn't deliver on its first two targets this year. Market-share losses Organic sales grew at a 1% pace in fiscal 2016, marking the second straight year of deceleration on this metric (growth was 2% and 3% in 2015 and 2014, respectively). Rivals Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB), in contrast, have been growing at between 3% and 5% as of late. By P&G's estimate, the company lost global market share in each of its major product categories, with the exception of fabric and home care, which was flat: Category Market-Share Change Beauty (1%) Grooming (1%) Healthcare (1%) Fabric and home care N/A Baby, feminine, and family care (1%) Source: P&G financial filings. The flat result in fabric is encouraging, given that it is P&G's biggest, most profitable segment. Executives hope to apply the innovation and advertising successes they've managed there to other areas of the business. Investors can judge the success or failure of those initiatives by watching the company's organic growth rates over the next few quarters. P&G aims to speed up to a 2% pace in fiscal 2017, which implies at least steady market share in its key competitive markets. Earnings declines Rather than highlighting reported per-share profits, which can fluctuate wildly in a period of major portfolio changes like this, management focuses on what they call core earnings. Instead of rising at a consistent 6% to 8% clip, this metric started low in 2014 and has gotten worse since then. Image source: P&G investor presentation. The picture improves markedly when you adjust for foreign-currency swings. By that measure, gains in core earnings per share were 7% in fiscal 2016. However, that was down from 14% in 2014 and 11% in 2015. P&G has more control over this metric since cost cuts can power improvements even if sales growth rates are weak. And that's exactly what's happened lately. The company has sliced billions of dollars out of its expense structure and plans to deliver another $10 billion of savings over the next five years. For the coming fiscal year, meanwhile, P&G believes it can get back on its long-term growth track by generating core EPS gains of around 6%. Cash flow for the win Thanks in part to those aggressive cost cuts, P&G nailed its third core financial goal. Adjusted free-cash-flow productivity amounted to 115% this year, compared to the 90% annual target that CEO David Taylor and his executive team strive to hit. As a result, the company is in a good position to fund increasing cash returns to shareholders over the next few years. Long term, share repurchases and dividend spending will need an assist from higher sales and profit growth. Robust organic growth is a must for P&G to claim it has truly recovered its long-term expansion pace. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Schwabe Brooks McCabe Charlie Bowen John Brown Dolly Withrow Linda Arnold Government Law Energy SHOP About Us Job Openings FirstEnergy to continue infrastructure upgrades in WV, MD through the end of the year Posted: Monday, August 15, 2016 3:33 PM EDT Updated: Wednesday, September 14, 2016 3:33 PM EDT By Sarah Tincher Connect Follow @sarahntincher FirstEnergy Corp. is planning to continue working on a variety of infrastructure projects in West Virginia and Maryland throughout the rest of the year, including taking steps to prepare for the Procter & Gamble facility that’s coming to Berkeley County. Altogether, the utility is working on projects that total $128 million in Potomac Edison’s service area. To date, more than $67 million of the total has been spent on a variety of projects, including transmission enhancements to reinforce the system and support economic growth, constructing new distribution circuits, and inspecting and replacing utility poles and underground cables. “These infrastructure enhancements are necessary to serve the influx of new residents and businesses to our Potomac Edison service territory,” James A. Sears Jr., vice president of Potomac Edison, said in a statement. “At the same time, we also are working on projects designed to help enhance the day-to-day service we provide our customers, such as replacing older underground cables and improving existing overhead facilities.” FirstEnergy, which will be providing electrical service to the new Procter & Gamble manufacturing plant near Martinsburg, West Virginia, is planning to spend about $4.6 million of the $9 million on engineering and site preparation in 2016. The project is scheduled for completion in 2017, and will ultimately include a new transmission substation and several power lines. The company will also spend $1 million to replace a transformer at a distribution substation near Charles Town, West Virginia, in addition to using another $7.4 million to replace the wire on three transmission lines to help reinforce the transmission system for about 75,000 customers in Jefferson and Berkeley counties. To the benefit of Potomac Edison customers in both West Virginia and Maryland, FirstEnergy will also spend $3.1 million to upgrade equipment on about 287 distribution circuits, as well as $2.1 million to inspect about 19,000 utility poles. FirstEnergy will also make an additional $4.6 million in upgrades in Frederick and Montgomery counties in Maryland. Another $12 million of the budgeted total will go toward transmission-related projects owned by the Trans-Allegheny Interstate Line Co., a FirstEnergy transmission affiliate.

Hamilton County needs legal self-help center Aftab Pureval 10:45 a.m. EDT August 15, 2016 Aftab Pureval (Photo: Provided) Aftab Pureval is the Democratic candidate for Hamilton County clerk of courts and an attorney at Procter & Gamble. There is nothing more fundamentally true in our country than that our courts should be the great equalizer – that no matter who you are, where you’re from, or how much money you have, you should be able to access justice. Unfortunately, in the real world, it doesn’t always work this way. If you can’t afford a lawyer, it is difficult to navigate a burdensome and bureaucratic court system to achieve what you need. The Franklin County court system and law students at The Ohio State University in Columbus are working to change that. Earlier this summer, the Franklin County Legal Self Help Center was launched to assist people who can’t afford attorneys with their legal needs. The center is staffed by law students and overseen by local attorneys. The center provides information and assistance to clients seeking information on where to go, what resources are available, what forms are required, and other administrative guidance in connection with proceedings before the court. The law students who work in the center provide information in key areas like landlord-tenant matters, expungements, consumer law issues, and other general division or small claims matters. If you need help in locating and using proper forms, understanding procedural requirements and eligibility questions, and drafting simple pleadings, you can go to the students who staff the center and get help with your case, so that you can get your issues resolved without having to pay for a lawyer. The idea for this center came out of a summit called Access to Justice that was hosted last year by the Supreme Court of Ohio and the Ohio State Bar Association. The Supreme Court and the Bar Association realized the significant impediments many people face in accessing our courts – and that these impediments often disproportionately impact the people who need the courts the most.  As the report concluded, “Access to justice is a cornerstone, a part of the foundation of a free and democratic society. When that foundation is weakened by limiting access to our justice system, then the very fabric of justice for all loses its reality for its citizens.” By launching this self-help center and giving all people the assistance to utilize our courts, Franklin County has made real progress toward ensuring that the courts are available for everyone. And we need to do that in Hamilton County. In Hamilton County, we already have some of the highest court fees in the state of Ohio, which prices people out of our courts. Add to that attorneys' fees that are often cost prohibitive and it’s no wonder that so many people believe justice is out of reach. By launching a self-help center to make it easier for citizens to figure out the forms they need and to get guidance on common areas of the law, we can ensure that in Hamilton County, there is no barrier to justice. And we are fortunate to have two terrific law schools – at the University of Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky University – within minutes of the courthouse Downtown. Their law students can gain practical experience working with real clients and provide an important benefit to our community. The purpose of our courts is to be the great leveler – the one place where everyone is equal. By launching a self-help center in Cincinnati, we’ll ensure that access to justice is available to all of us, not just some of us. 513 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 3 COMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2bup9RR TOP VIDEOS Watch Google Home struggle to answer queries 1:34 Cole Swindell has ‘You Should be Here’ moment on CMA Awards red carpet 2:01 Cole Swindell talks about is favorite 30 seconds while on CMA Awards red carpet! 1:01 RaeLynn’s reaction to watching old clips from ‘The Voice’ is priceless! 0:50 What’s it like to be inducted into Country Music Hall of Fame?

By Vittorio Cretella In 2014, Mars Inc. acquired IAMS, EUKANUBA and NATURA from The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) – a $1.2 billion carve-out acquisition that was critical to its Petcare division’s future success. As a century-old company and a leader in the consumer packaged goods industry, Mars has executed many acquisitions; yet not many compared to this. Ensuring a seamless transition of services and benefits for 1,000 new associates at 20 North American sites in 120 days – with no data errors and no interruption to the business – was no small task. So how did we succeed in executing a seamless integration (and the fastest close in P&G history)? As the dust has settled and we approach the two-year anniversary of this milestone, it’s clear to me that our experience holds important lessons that can be used to guide similar integrations across a variety of organizations. The single most important success factor was investing early in scalable systems. In fact, the bulk of the work that enabled the integration – notably our transition to a cloud-based email and collaboration suite and our adoption of a common global enterprise resource planning (ERP) platform – began as much as a decade before. If you consider the “must haves” for business continuity, getting paid and being able to communicate are the two basics – two of the areas where IT really has to deliver seamlessly. Transitioning our new colleagues from their P&G email addresses to Mars addresses was one of the first things we delivered as part of the transition, and it was possible because of a major transformation that we undertook in 2012, which included moving from an internally-hosted legacy infrastructure to a widely-used cloud-based email and collaboration suite. Adopting this platform gave us a more dynamic, scalable and easily-administered collaboration space, one that allowed us to stand up key repositories to create a “one-stop-shop” for benefits, company policies and other important information. Equally importantly, by going through the process of migrating 40,000+ Mars Associates to the new suite in 2012, our team gained invaluable experience and best practices – experience that gave us a template to use for the P&G acquisition two years later. End-to-end business processes Another early investment that paid dividends during the acquisition took place in the early 2000s, when we developed a common ERP platform for end-to-end business processes. Leveraging that platform to reflect standard best practices across our global Petcare business, we developed a common set of business-enabling tools – covering everything from HR and finance, to manufacturing and procurement – tailored to Mars’ compliance levels and operational needs. This template had been road-tested and put into place at each of our existing Petcare sites, so by the time the P&G acquisition happened, it wasn’t a question of “will this work?” or “what’s the best functionality?” but rather “how quickly can we execute our established process?” By making investments like these early on, we’ve been able to create an IT environment that is more nimble, flexible and responsive to major business changes. We see the potential of technology and data to solve our toughest challenges and seize our biggest opportunities, and we’re proud that IT has become a true partner to our colleagues across the business – becoming both a growth-enabler and a source of competitive advantage.

By DARREN ROVELL via ESPN Aug 19, 2016, 7:00 PM ET 0 Shares Email Star 0 Shares Email It has been another successful Summer Olympics for Team USA, which handily leads the medal standings. Now come the interesting questions for corporate America. Will Michael Phelps, who has a new family, be motivated to cash in? Which company will win the Simone Biles sweepstakes? Will Katie Ledecky, Simone Manuel and Sydney McLaughlin be lured from school for a financial windfall? Here are my rankings of the endorsement prospects for U.S. Olympic standouts: 1. Michael Phelps, swimmer Although he might be retired, he firmly established himself as the greatest Olympian of all time. Phelps, who has 23 Olympic gold medals, doesn't love making speeches, long the bread and butter of Olympic champions. But he can clean up for years at corporate events. Under Armour couldn't go all out with its marketing of Phelps during the Games, but it will be interesting to see how big they can grow him. Something to watch might be his swimwear partner, Aqua Sphere, trying to grow the "MP" logo and signing swimmers to deals to compete against Speedo and Arena. 2. Simone Biles, gymnast Matich loves that Michigan's play reflects Harbaugh's personality How will Gronk's absence impact Patriots? Remembering the legacy of Ralph Branca Kelly's job is safe with Notre Dame sc The most golden gymnast in a single Olympics with four golds, Biles has a chance to make a mint. Expect her representatives at Octagon, which also represents Phelps, to sign four-year deals that will take her beyond the 2020 Games in Tokyo. Companies have been leery about throwing too much future cash at American gymnastics stars because there's always someone new four years later, but Biles' dominance in Rio will help alleviate that. Don't expect Procter & Gamble, Hershey's or Nike to give up what they already bought in Biles, who has 2.5 million Instagram followers. 3. Katie Ledecky, swimmer Phelps or no Phelps, Ledecky is the most dominant swimmer in the world. She is going to Stanford, which means she can't take any endorsement deals immediately, but perhaps the lesson of Missy Franklin will make Ledecky a free agent sooner. Franklin was a swimming star of the 2012 Games but didn't take money after it so she could swim at Cal. In Rio, she failed to even make an individual final. Ledecky might swim one year at Stanford before turning pro. The swimsuit battle for Ledecky will be the most hotly contested marketing war for a woman that the market has ever seen. 4. Simone Manuel, swimmer A company landing the other "Simone" is hardly a consolation prize. The first African-American swimmer to win an individual gold medal (in the 50-meter freestyle) also attends Stanford, but there's a possibility, like with Ledecky, that she'll quickly move to the pro ranks. Manuel already gave a fun and free post-Olympics endorsement when she returned home and plugged Shipley Do-Nuts on social media. 5. Aly Raisman, gymnast Captain of the gold medal-winning "Fierce Five" in 2012 and "Final Five" in Rio, Raisman will get deals for her strong past (she earned four individual-event medals at the two Games combined) and will have a nice speaking career if she wants. Because of her age, 22, she will likely lose out on some endorsements to younger teammates Madison Kocian and Laurie Hernandez. 6. Ashton Eaton, track and field Eaton capitalized on his first gold in the decathlon in London and was prominently featured by Nike and United leading up to and throughout the Rio Games. While the title of "world's best athlete" is his again, it's really the world's fastest man (100 meters) who draws most of the marketing dollars. But, out of any U.S. Olympian, he is the most impressive in person and will get significant dollars if he chooses to go for a third gold in 2020. 7. Sydney McLaughlin, track and field Continuing the theme of companies not being able to get what they want, McLaughlin -- who just turned 17 -- likely won't turn pro until she finishes high school next year. But with Allyson Felix closing out her career and no one else really emerging on the track the way U.S. swimmers have, McLaughlin is a good investment. In Rio, she made it to the semis in the 400-meter hurdles. 8. Ryan Murphy, swimmer There are plenty of young American female swimmers. Not so much on the men's team. Nathan Adrian is 27, and fellow medalist Anthony Ervin is 35. Ryan Lochte, after his bizarre nonrobbery scandal, isn't getting any new endorsements anytime soon, even if he comes back for 2020. That leaves us with the 21-year-old Murphy, who destroyed the competition on his way to winning gold in the 100- and 200-meter backstrokes. 9. Danell Leyva, gymnast Leyva, who won the bronze in the all-around in London, took home two individual silvers in Rio. He's 24, which means he could be back in 2020. The Cuban native is bilingual, a major plus for brands. 10. Lilly King, swimmer King was upstaged by Ledecky and Manuel, but her bold stance against her main competitor, Russian Yulia Efimova, in the 100-meter breaststroke did two things: It was reminiscent of the old Cold War sports battles, and it was one of the boldest statements an active athlete had ever made about a competitor who had tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. Efimova tested positive in 2013 and was suspended from the sport. King's stance and victory over Efimova, combined with her sense of nationalism, made her stand out and boosted her Twitter following tenfold in a matter of weeks. King swims at Indiana and, unlike Ledecky and Manuel, the money she might be able to earn in endorsements doesn't figure to make leaving college an absolute no-brainer. 0 Shares Email Star Comments " Which 10 U.S. Olympians have the best endorsement prospects?

(Photo by Alex Livesey/Getty Images) PHOTO: Getty Images Pinterest Facebook As a member of both 2012's #FierceFive and 2016's #FinalFive, Gabby Douglas is no stranger to the Olympic Games, and the spotlight that comes with it. Still in Rio ahead of Sunday's closing ceremony, the P&G Venus spokeswoman made time to talk to Glamour for a quick Q&A about life on Team USA. Glamour: How did you guys celebrate winning team gold in the all-arounds? Gabby Douglas: We kind of didn’t have any time. We had more competitions. We celebrated on the stand! Glamour: What about when the gymnastics events ended? Did you celebrate then? GD: Yes and no. We're all still in Rio...when we get home we'll celebrate fully. Glamour: Then what? Train for Tokyo? GD: Maybe. First the team is going to New York, and then the tour, and then a break from training. Glamour: What are you looking forward to doing during your downtime? GD: I like to hike and play with my dogs and spend time with my family. We go out to family dinners a lot. Pinterest Facebook PHOTO: AFP/Getty Images PHOTO: Getty Images Gabby Douglas competes on the uneven bars in Rio. ||| Glamour: You and Aly Raisman are the only team members who had been to the Olympics before. Did you have advice for Madison Kochian, Simone Biles and Laurie Hernandez? GD: Well...the other girls have experience. They’ve been competing on a lot of international world-class stages. They knew what to expect and what to do and what not to do. Me and Aly just gave them advice on the media side. We said, it’s gonna be crazy. It’s the Olympics. But it’s gonna be fun! Glamour: Do you ever think about what you might be doing if you had never gotten started on gymnastics? Going to high school and college and...just the normal progression? GD: Sometimes I step back and think, wow, who does this? Who has a floor routine? Who works out every day? Who does flips in the air? Who does that? But at the same time, it’s natural. I’ve been doing gymnastics for 16 years.” With golds from multiple games to her name, we'd say those years have paid off. Keywords: Gabby Douglas Olympics Get Glamour In Your Inbox!

Millions of people use the Internet for news, entertainment, to socialise and above all, to keep up with what’s hot, on sale and available to them. That’s where social media influencers come in. These are people who garner huge followings simply on the strength of their personalities, and leverage their fans to make money by endorsing products – or even selling their own. These products could be anything from beauty and fitness products to nightclub appearances and holiday destinations. Fitness guru Jane Mukami and fashion stylist Silvia Njoki are just two Kenyan social media influencers, who have grown their brands purely by clever use of their social media accounts.  THE FITNESS QUEEN: JANE MUKAMI Twitter/Instagram: @fitkenyangirl Website: www.janemukami.com Jane Mukami has a degree in computer information systems from Kennesaw State University (Georgia, USA). She worked in the field from 1999, but a personal decision to lose weight in 2008 led her down an unexpected path, transforming her into a personal fitness brand and one of Kenya’s notable social media influencers. Before it all began “Three years after beginning my personal fitness journey, I discovered I had passion for fitness. My social media posts changed to reflect this and people started sending me messages requesting information on how to get fit. I decided to start blogging in order to share my love for fitness and tips with others.” Seeing the potential “I had no intention to build a fitness brand until Jessica Mutuku (a branding, marketing and monetisation expert) contacted me in 2012. She saw potential that I couldn’t even wrap my mind around at that time. We started working together and in 2014, we launched janemukami.com.” Taking the leap “I remember trying to explain to my mother that I was moving back to Kenya to build a virtual business. She couldn’t understand why I was leaving a well-paying career and a comfortable lifestyle to begin ‘some internet job’. Moving back to Kenya after living in the US for 16 years and kissing my career goodbye was a scary, bold move. But I knew that this is where my market was. I don’t think I ever felt safe (about the move) but I knew I needed to take that risk.”  “The brand’s objective is to help others transform their lives through fitness, health and wellness. It is a fully fledged virtual business. I have a team of people who help me run and manage different aspects. The day-to-day activities involve consulting, posting content, running (fitness) challenges, answering questions, customer support, etc.” The returns “I got my first client in 2012 when I was still in the US – they paid me $250 (Sh25,000) for meal plans and $300 (Sh30,000) per month for personal training. In 2015 the brand started generating enough income for me to quit my job. I have received a lot of business opportunities from corporates, organisations, TV stations, etc, but I am careful to (only) partner with initiatives that are well aligned with my brand. My e-book has sold 10,000 copies in less than a year, on Amazon, all over the world – North America, Australia and 70-plus countries in Europe, Asia and Africa. I’ve had marvelous social and business experiences – like working with the First Lady on the Beyond Zero campaign and having Kevin Harrington, one of the original Sharks from Shark Tank as a partner/advisor, and a member of my board of directors.” The recipe “Authenticity, branding and social media marketing have played a huge role in my brand’s success. Authenticity fosters a real connection with your audience. I don’t feel like I have to be in character when I am in public I don’t walk around with a made-up face or dressed extremely fancy. When eating out, I stick to certain rules but if I am indulging (for example, I love cake!), I share it on social media and let people know that I also indulge once in a while.” Personal brands and virtual businesses “Even though there are only a small number of internet influencers who are reaping the rewards of having a massive presence in Kenya, I think it’s only a matter of time before we get to where the West is. I am pursuing some such opportunities. The only challenge is that corporate clients here are scared of investing adequately because they don’t fully understand the value of social media and its exponential returns on investment.”   __________  THE FASHION GURU: SILVIA NJOKI Twitter/Instagram: @stylesilvia Website: www.silvianjoki.com  When she graduated from the University of Nairobi with a degree in nutrition and food technology, Silvia Njoki didn’t feel like spending the rest of her life in a food lab. The following year, in 2011, she enrolled in a fashion styling course at Central Saint Martin (London) and Nuova Academia di Belle Arti (Milan). She credits her three-year-old daughter, Nielsine, as the inspiration for what would later become a personal brand with a robust digital following.  Before it all began “As a young girl I dreamt of being a fashion designer. Back then I didn’t know what a stylist was but in high school I secretly organised fashion shows for my classmates and styled them using bed sheets, khangas and whatever else was available. I was admitted to Nairobi University on the basis of my grades but while there, I used my free time to attend fashion events and network. By my third year in university, I was interning as a stylist in magazines and TV shows.” The making “I started my blog about  four years ago. My newborn daughter inspired me to create Style by Silvia to showcase her outfits – including some I’d sewn myself. It was an instant hit. The blog transformed into what it is today – a place where I share my styling experience and personal style moments. I also style individuals.” It takes time “It took me close to a year and half before I started making money through endorsements and promotions. You have to start climbing the ladder from the bottom – so at the beginning I was content with earning minimal fees. Eventually, the contracts started trickling in.” Far-reaching opportunities “The discovery of my brand’s international prominence took me by surprise. Some of my most treasured moments this year have been the P&G Future Fabrics event in Barcelona (P&G actually flew me there Business Class!), being invited to Los Angeles as one of the four African bloggers nominated for the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards and going to Dakar, Senegal to represent Kenya at the first edition of the Festival of African Bloggers and Youtubers (FABY).” Safety in numbers? “Although my brand has been growing consistently, I still wouldn’t say I feel safe to rely on it as my sole source of income. However, my job as a fashion journalist can sustain me comfortably. I am not required to be there full-time so I can devote myself to growing the brand. Running this online platform is a lot of hard work. Sometimes it occupies my entire day.” Authenticity and the branding of one’s self “I am getting a lot more attention now so I probably wouldn’t walk into a mall looking unkempt. However, the way I dress is really how I want to dress so I feel that I am truly authentic. It takes a lot more than just being on social media to succeed – no matter who I endorse or promote, I want to stay true to myself. Nevertheless, without the full impact of the digital media, my brand wouldn’t enjoy the visibility it does.” Personal brands and virtual businesses – what’s in store in Kenya? “A few of my close friends who are online personalities in Africa have already made it into the millionaires’ club, so we are not so far behind the rest of the (developed) world. I would like to get there as well. The challenge, as in all walks of life, lies in keeping the momentum, especially after you have arrived at the top.”  ********* Vera Sidika She rose to fame on the basis of her ample posterior. Today, her Instagram account, boasting a following of 404,000, describes her as a ‘reality TV star, host, interior designer and entrepreneur’. While her ‘career choice’ might be deemed questionable and aspects of it hazy, news about her always makes for good entertainment. Sidika has managed to capitalise on the buzz around her personality to make enough money to furnish a seemingly lavish lifestyle. Other than hosting parties around the world (in May, she hosted shows in three Chinese cities), she has also launched businesses – among them a hair lounge and a modeling agency. There are talks of an upcoming reality TV show to her name.  Huddah Monroe She has a solid following of 803,000 on Instagram. She first rose to fame on Facebook, posting modelling pictures, and this led to her participation in continental reality show Big Brother Africa in 2013 and a series of semi-nude pictures she later released. Three years later, Monroe, who refers herself as the ‘mistress of all trades’, has become an entrepreneur. In addition to her clothing and lipstick line, international companies riding on the ‘Huddah’ brand have seen her become the brand ambassador for Uber, BrightenMi cosmetics and Chinese telcom company Huawei. One of her newest Instagram video-posts indicates that she has landed the AIDS Healthcare Foundation’s ambassadorship for the love-condoms campaign – an initiative that promotes access, acceptance and usage of condoms to control the spread of HIV/AIDS. Socialite to millionaire (US) The queen of all social media influencers, Kim Kardashian-West, with 79.8 million followers on Instagram and 47.3 million followers on Twitter, used her body to grow that social media following. In 2010, this paid off as she started garnering endorsement deals. She has since gone on to release products to her name. She is now leveraging her social media following to sell products such as her (Kim Kardashian emojis). Her Hollywood mobile game generated $71.8 million in income in 2015. Vlogger to author (UK) A recent entrant into the millionaires’ club, YouTube star Zoe Sugg started out as a beauty vlogger known as Zoella. She is now one of Britain’s most influential tweeps. In 2014, with 6.5 million (now at 11 million plus) subscribers under her belt she published her book, Girl Online. It sold 78,000 copies in its first week and became the fastest selling book of 2014. Three months after her book’s release, she had made enough money to buy a five-bedroom mansion for about $1.5 million. A sequel, Girl Online: On Tour was released in 2015. email print In the headlines Bassira Toure at the double as Mali sent Kenya packing Harambee Starlets on Wednesday bowed out of the running for a place in the Africa Women’s Cup of Kenya 1-3 Mali, AWCON RESULT: Bassira Toure’s double sends Harambee Starlets packing Harambee Starlets take on Mali in their second Group B match at the Omnisport Stadium in Limbe on Kenyans illegally in US told to prepare for the worst — VIDEO Another magistrate attacked in court Detectives pounce on MP upon release MPs storm police station, demand Sarah Korere arrest - PHOTOS Manhunt launched for gang linked to Mumias arms theft This man Mathew Lempurkel Latest: Life and Style Showbiz FBI clears Brad Pitt over abuse claim   Showbiz Kanye suffered mental breakdown: reports   Health, Science and Environment Zika babies can develop microcephaly in first year   DN2 Harambee in action   DN2 #FRONTROW: We need more people like Boniface Mwangi   DN2 CAR CLINIC: Here is what is wrong with Tiguans, Touaregs   Smart_Company Africa’s move on palm oil to hurt local industries   LATEST FROM NAIROBI NEWS LATEST NTV VIDEOS Surgery by a quack: Patients narrate ordeal at hands of quack doctor Raila defends Kingi: CORD leader says Kilifi governor is fighting graft IEBC tender appeal: Hearing in appeal against ballot papers tender starts Mihango land row: President Kenyatta orders KDF to vacate disputed land Armed men attack Booker Police Post in Mumias Watch More Videos Contact Us FAQ E-papers About Us Business Daily Daily Monitor Nairobi News NTV The Citizen The EastAfrican

Sarah WuAug 19, 2016 3:10PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestCourtesy of Instagram/@lauriehernandez_ Laurie Hernandez – youngest member of the U.S. women’s gymnastics routine and gold medalist, has yet another thing to smile about now. More specifically, her expressive smile (which apparently gave rise to the nickname the “human emoji”) is coming to a Crest ad near you. Laurie is now the face of Crest and Orgullosa, which is P&G’s online, Latina community, NewBeauty reports. “When you’re given the opportunity of a lifetime to perform on the world’s biggest stage, smiling with confidence for your family and supporters is part of every routine,” says Laurie in the brand’s release. We’ve seen her megawatt beam all over her Instagram, so it comes as no surprise to us that her pearly whites are now taking the stage, too. We can’t wait to see her upcoming campaign, and we have a feeling she’ll be smiling wider than ever. In the meantime, we’ll await her tips for getting teeth that shine brighter than her medals – because while we won’t be owning the latter, we can certainly try for the former.

By Lonnie Shekhtman, Staff August 19, 2016 Save for later Saved The International Space Station. NASA/AP View Caption About video ads View Caption of As NASA prepares to stop funding the International Space Station (ISS) in about a decade, the agency is appealing to companies to use the science lab to test their wildest space-business ideas while they still can. Eventually, NASA hopes that low Earth orbit will become a hub of commercial activity, with enterprises operating in space independently of the ISS. “NASA is interested in what exciting, new ideas people have for using the ISS that could lead to space being just another place to go to work or school,” NASA said in a request for information in July. In response, 11 submissions “from a broad range of respondents including individuals, small companies and large companies,” came in, said Sam Scimemi, division director for the ISS program, in an e-mail to Bloomberg. Recommended: Could you survive the Star Wars universe? Take our quiz! While the nature of the ideas has not been made public, some of the research already taking place aboard the ISS might offer some clues. Merck, Novartis, and Procter & Gamble are among the companies that have taken advantage of the microgravity environment of the space station to do drug research. Another company has tested the effects of low gravity on alloys, or metals that are used extensively on Earth in car parts, golf clubs, electronics, and medical devices. Test your knowledge Could you survive the Star Wars universe? Take our quiz! Photos of the Day Photos of the day 11/23 Just a few of weeks ago, a research lab developed by Texas-based private company NanoRacks was attached to the space station with two experiments on board. One, sent up by a company called Yosemite Space, is testing how computer chips can be used in future space missions to power autonomous vehicles and data processing. "What I really hope is what we’re doing with these early commercial researchers, there will one day be way more than the ISS can handle,” Michael Read, who manages National Lab, an economic development program of the ISS, told The Christian Science Monitor in January. The ISS is well-suited to research in areas like health to materials sciences, and as a testbed for technologies that could be used for missions deeper into space. But there could be other possibilities that NASA hasn’t even considered, the agency says. “Some companies are asking to use the ISS as a stepping stone for other, more ‘out-of-the box’ concepts, such as future space stations that are commercially owned and operated,” NASA says on its blog. “Whether a commercial space station is a hotel, a research facility, a university, or a combination of all of these ideas is open for discussion.” A space hotel is not out of the realm of possibility. Tourists delivered to space by Blue Origin, a space tourism company owned by Amazon chief Jeff Bezos, might one day need somewhere to stay. The company has said that it could start shooting paying passengers into space as early as 2018.  NASA, in the meantime, is scheduled to leave the space station by 2028. As the primary funder, the agency is spending $3 billion annually to run the 16-year-old science laboratory orbiting Earth 240 miles up in the air. That expense is expected to rise to $4 billion by 2020, according to ArsTechnica. NASA is promising a crewed mission to Mars in the 2030s, and it cannot afford to support both the space station and a deep-space mission, William Gerstenmaier, the agency’s chief of human spaceflight, said last year. “We’re going to get out of ISS as quickly as we can,” Mr. Gerstenmaier said at a December meeting, as ArsTechnica reported. “Whether it gets filled in by the private sector or not, NASA’s vision is we’re trying to move out.” Next up Test your knowledge Could you survive the Star Wars universe?

In continental Europe, markets ended sharply higher, driven by gains in basic resource stocks. Furthermore, positive corporate earnings released fuelled buying. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 advanced 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively. Wall Street Wall Street ended in the green, as oil prices rallied amid speculations that major oil producers would freeze production. Additionally, positive economic data and upbeat earnings released boosted investor confidence. The S&P 500 increased 0.2%, with the energy sector losing the most. Asia Equities are trading mixed, as some Fed officials reiterated the possibility of hiking interest rates in the coming months. The Nikkei 225 gained 0.4%, while the Hang Seng was trading 0.3% down at 7:00 am. Oil Yesterday, WTI prices increased 3.1% to US$48.22 per barrel, while Brent oil prices rose 2.1% to US$50.89 per barrel. Headlines Retail sales in UK jump in July As per the Office for National Statistics, the UK’s retail sales grew 5.9% y-o-y in July, above economists’ forecast of a 4.2% rise, after gaining 4.3% in June. Sales, excluding auto fuel, surged 5.4% y-o-y in July compared with the 3.9% growth in June. The increase in sales was primarily led by warmer weather conditions and a weaker pound. Company news Concepta (LON:CPT, 11.88p)– Speculative Buy Concepta's AIM Admission followed a reverse takeover from Frontier Resources International plc and renaming back on 25th July. Injected into the corporate shell was a pioneering UK healthcare company and developer of a proprietary platform and suite of products targeted at the personalised mobile health market with a primary focus on women's fertility and specifically unexplained infertility. Yesterday, the Company announces its unaudited results for the six months ended 30 June 2016. Operational highlights for the period included the disposal or dissolution of all oil and gas related subsidiaries of the legacy business, while the new management undertook a strategic review while completing the acquisition of Concepta plc for £3.026 million comprising 30,343,950 New Ordinary Shares and £0.75 million in cash. Its MyLotus brand is a unique offering that allows quantitative and qualitative measurement of a woman's personal hCG and LH hormone levels in urine samples. It has defined its route to market as, (i) Regulatory approvals for launch in China in place - first order from distributor with payment in advance expected following hospital testing in Q3 2016 and, (ii) CE-Marking for UK and Europe to follow in 2017. The Company’s cash balance at the period end was US$1.335m (H1 2015: US$0.02m), while incurring losses of US$0.336m from continuing operations (H1 2015: US$0.504m). Our view: Concepta has fills an important need for a significant number of apparently fertile women who, for apparently unexplained reasons, consistently fail to conceive. The pregnancy and ovulation testing markets are well established and global, with significantly the largest brand being Clearblue, the flagship of Swiss Precision Diagnostics GmbH, a 50:50 JV with Procter & Gamble. But such products are incapable of measuring the personal hCG and LH hormone levels necessary to optimise fertility cycle timing and thereby provide a genuine alternative to the IVF clinic. The global revenue opportunity for Concepta runs into billions of dollars and its initial target markets in China and Europe are estimated to have potential in the region of £600m alone. Concepta’s proprietary home-testing/point-of-care equipment also lends itself to wider family home-health monitoring to improve individual health parameters including chronic stress, inflammation, urinary tract, healthy pregnancy progression etc. Indeed, Concepta find itself in a unique position to come in at the ground floor of the fast growing global connected healthcare sector, which is set to be worth US$61bn by 2020. Beaufort places a Speculative Buy recommendation on the shares. Beaufort Securities acts as corporate broker to Concepta Kingfisher (LON:KGF, 364.70p)– Hold Kingfisher provided a trading update for Q2 FY 2016 ending 31st July 2016. During the period, sales advanced 8.4% y-o-y to £3.0bn in reported basis, or 3.2% at constant currency basis, while like-for-like (LFL) sales expanded 3.0% at constant currency basis, compared with Q2 FY 2015. In the UK and Ireland, sales rose 5.1% to £1.4bn in reported basis, with an LFL sales growth of 7.2%. Sales from France rose 10.4% to £1.1bn in reported basis, while LFL sales declined 3.2%. Sales from Other International grew 12.8% to £539m on a reported basis, with LFL sales increasing 7.0%. On the operational front, Kingfisher completed disposal of the remaining 30% economic interest in B&Q China following the regulatory approval and received net cash proceeds of £63m. The company has returned £150m (44 million shares) to date to shareholders since year end through share buyback. Our view: Kingfisher delivered excellent performance in Q2 FY 2016. The company recorded an increase in sales on both reported and LFL fronts. Kingfisher’s growth was led by a rise in sales of tools to tradesmen in the UK and a surge in sales in its Polish division. Wet weather conditions and extensive industrial activities led to fall in sales in the company’s French business. The Group’s ONE Kingfisher plan announced in March 2015 to create a unified, unique and leading home improvement offer while driving digital capability and optimising operational efficiency is making good progress and remains ahead of schedule. The company continued to enhance shareholder value through its share buyback programme. However, Brexit has created uncertainty in the market and dampened investor confidence. We would like to wait and assess Kingfisher’s performance in the near future, and thus maintain a Hold rating. National Grid (LON:NG., 1,081.50p) - Buy National Grid provided an update on Mid-Period Review (MPR) for the RIIO-T1 price control, conducted by UK energy regulator Ofgem. The areas covered under MPR are related to specific outputs, with eight-year allowances in Gas Transmission and Electricity Transmission. Following the review, Ofgem proposed that allowances adjusted to reflect that some outputs are no longer required, which would result in a reduction of £169m in Gas Transmission and £38m in Electricity Transmission. Ofgem also proposed to approve £21m of the request related to the enhancement of system operator outputs. These changes are expected to be implemented April 2018 onwards. Our view: The aforementioned update highlights Ofgem’s proposal to scrap some of the power and gas projects undertaken by National Grid. The scope of MPR is narrow, with no changes to financial parameters of the framework. National Grid delivered excellent performance in FY 2016 on both financial and operational fronts. The company benefitted from the electricity price difference in Britain and continental Europe, which lifted the trading volumes on its network. National Grid recorded robust growth in the UK and generated savings of over £330m for customers in the first three years of regulated price control (RIIO). The company made substantial progress with rate filings in New York and Massachusetts. Value-added metric, which reflects the key component of value delivery to shareholders, was strong with value added in the year totalling £1.8bn or 47.6p per share. National Grid is selling majority stake in its UK gas distribution business. After the sale, the company expects to deliver higher growth and maintain a strong balance sheet to fund its investment programme. In light of the above argument, we maintain a Buy rating on the stock. Physiomics (LON:PYC, 0.03p) - Speculative Buy Following the announcement on 31st March 2016 of its intention to acquire BioMoti Limited, Physiomics yesterday announced it has signed a Share Purchase Agreement with BioMoti. The acquisition remains conditional on the Company completing a successful placing to raise a minimum of £1m to develop the new joint Group's drug discovery and development pipeline. BioMoti's platform technology, Oncojan creates nanoparticles which package cancer drugs into sustained release delivery vehicles which are then coated with tumour targeting protein called CD95R (http://www.biomoti.com/technology/). BioMoti's lead asset, MOTI1001, contains the drug paclitaxel which has been approved for many years and is widely used to treat various types of cancer, therefore mitigating the risk of development. In pre-clinical mouse models of ovarian cancer MOTI1001 has shown significantly greater ability to shrink tumours than paclitaxel alone and also appears to be significantly more tolerable. The Consideration for the acquisition will comprise, (i) 50% of the entire issued share capital of the Company immediately prior to Completion (but for clarity prior to the issue of any ordinary shares in connection with the Placing) and: (ii) £50k in cash (subject to certain completion accounting adjustments to reflect the actual levels of cash and liabilities in the Company at completion). For the period ended 30 November 2015, BioMoti Limited had a turnover of £2,062 made a loss for the financial year of £9,700 and its gross assets were valued at £2,331. Completion is expected to occur on or before 31 October 2016. Our view: If the BioMoti deal completes, Physiomics risk profile and prospective funding needs will change quite significantly. But that said, there is significant potential value in developing an oncology pipeline alongside existing and new opportunities in base modelling and simulation. And the existing pharmaceutical base development and simulation business continues to record important progress. Since March 2015, for example, it has confirmed the first contract for a clinical version of its Virtual Tumour model with global pharmaceutical company, Merck Serono, a (4th) large pharma customer for its Virtual Tumour (pre-clinical) model and a new speciality pharma customer for PK/ PD modelling of a new drug combination in the pain space and a subsequent extension of this contract, along with the 5th, 6th and 7th extensions to a Virtual Tumour project with a major global pharmaceutical company with which has now been a client for over 4 years. Credibility and momentum of Virtual Tumour Clinical, however, will take time to build into the high-margin repeat business envisaged by the Company’s original business plan so the new management now headed by CEO, Dr Jim Millen, is seeking to bolt on a new complementary arm that can create value by both exploiting its existing skills/development tools as well as generating additional newsflow. This will be created through Virtual Tumour being utilised to increase value of internal drug candidates via optimised regimens while targeting CD95L might also provide a way to personalise cancer treatment to appropriate patients. Additionally, Physiomics could employ its modelling techniques to predict the patients who would benefit most from drug candidates, and the Oncojan™ platform could be used in conjunction with Virtual Tumour to develop further targeted therapies for different cancer indications and drug combinations. So Physiomics is most certainly set to become a rather more exciting prospect. It needs to be recognised, however, that the proposed raise in this funding round will likely only suffice for a quite limited period and that the enlarged Group can be expected to seek additional support from shareholder as its projects progress. Beaufort places a Speculative Buy recommendation on the shares. Premier Oil (LON:PMO, 76.50p) - Speculative Buy In its Interims, Premier has raised its production guidance for FY2016 to 68-73k boepd and reported that it will be free cash-flow positive in H2 with oil prices above US$45 per barrel. Recent production has exceeded 95k boepd, helped by the 14k boepd from the first producer well on the Solan field. The second and final producer well on the Solan field is expected to be tied in shortly and to reach production of 20-25k boepd. The Catcher development project (Premier: 50% operating interest) remains on track for first oil in H2 2017. The subsea installation campaign is ahead of plan, while all six development wells drilled to date have met or exceeded predictions for reservoir quality while flow rates have been at or above prognosis. Negotiations on refinancing are reported as making good progress. The negotiations centre on amending covenants and extending debt maturities. The company anticipates negotiations to conclude and new agreements in place during H2 2016. Our view: The debt restructuring was anticipated to take time but the Company have indicated that ‘Good progress is being made with the company's lending group over amendments to the medium term covenant profile and resetting of debt maturities’. With continuing production growth (Solan, EON assets acquisition) and Catcher on target for product 2017, we maintain our Speculative Buy stance on the Company. Tullow Oil (LON:TLW, 239.60p) - Speculative Buy Tullow Oil has announced that first oil has flowed from the Tweneboa, Enyenra, Ntomme (TEN) fields offshore Ghana. First oil has been reached on time and on budget three years after the Plan of Development was approved in May 2013. The TEN start-up process is now well advanced and Tullow expects oil production to ramp-up gradually towards the FPSO capacity of 80,000 bopd through the remainder of 2016. Tullow estimates that TEN average annualised production in 2016 will be approximately 23,000 bopd gross (net: 11,000 bopd). Tullow is the operator of the TEN fields and holds a 47.175% stake. Tullow's joint venture partners are Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (17%), Kosmos Energy (17%), Ghana National Petroleum Corporation (15%) and PetroSA (3.875%). Our view: This is an important moment for Tullow as production begins from the TEN fields. It is also pleasing to report the delivering of this project on time and on budget. This brings to a close a period of heavy investment for Tullow, and we look forward to seeing debt (US$4.7bn) reduction. It is important that production at least meets guidance for real impact on the debt reduction. Tullow Oil is one of Beaufort Securities Tips for the Year, and whilst we retain a Speculative Buy on the Company, short-term investors may wish to lock in some profits.

BAKER, STAFF WRITER / Published: August 19, 2016 Article Tools Font size – + Share This     Procter & Gamble President and CEO David Taylor, center, cuts a ceremonial cake marking the P&G Mehoopany plant’s 50th anniversary Thursday afternoon. At left is local Family Care Plant Manager Laszlo Varga and at right is Baby Care Plant Manager Jose Manuel Sanchez. STAFF PHOTO/ROBERT BAKER ROBERT BAKER / STAFF PHOTO Procter & Gamble President and CEO David Taylor addresses a crowd marking the P&G Mehoopany plant’s 50th anniversary Thursday afternoon. Mr. Taylor was plant manager there from 1989 to 1991. WASHINGTON TWP. — The Procter & Gamble plant in Wyoming County pulled out all the stops for its 50th birthday celebration Thursday with a pep talk from the parent company’s president and chief executive officer. David Taylor was introduced as having been “made in Mehoopany” as he was plant manager there from 1989 to 1991. Mr. Taylor said he knew early on “that if you had the passion to do what is right for people, excellence will prevail.” He said that three things really stood out while he was in Washington Twp.: A mastery of technical and operating details, “a high standard where good is not good enough as you want to be better than your best global competitor,” and an excellence that all starts with delighting the customer, “and we’ve done that.” He was in Silicon Valley last week and will be in China, Philippines and Singapore next week, but wanted to be in Wyoming County this week because of the significant milestone of marking a half century “where excellence really is timeless.” Mr. Taylor said it was a tremendous honor to be head of P&G worldwide, as he has been since November 2015. He said he learned in Wyoming County “it’s not what you personally do, it’s what you and those around you can make happen.” “I’m standing on the shoulder of so many people who built this facility into what it is, and I’m proud of all of you,” he said, but noted “the best is ahead of us, and the group here now is ready to write the next chapter of successes.” The local plant employs around 2,000 people, the largest of P&G’s 138 manufacturing facilities around the world. Fifty percent of Procter & Gamble’s family care products (Charmin tissue, and Bounty paper towels and napkins) are made in Wyoming County. Thirty percent of its baby care products (Pampers and Luvs diapers) are made here, too. Pampers is a $10 billion-a-year brand for P&G and well over a billion dollars of that comes out of Wyoming County. The first product line of Pampers was successfully made in October 1966 by a workforce then forecast to grow to just 350.

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Latino Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Login Account You're logged in as   Profile Logout Search Site Home Video News Politics Money Opinion Entertainment Sports Health Lifestyle Español Gymnast Laurie Hernandez gets first brand deal after Olympic success Published August 18, 2016 Fox News Latino Latina gymnast Laurie Hernandez becomes Team USA superstar Laurie Hernandez is the first Latina gymnast to participate in the Olympics since Cuban-American Annia Hatch in 2004.  Laurie Hernandez’s agent revealed that her phone has been ringing none stop since the 16-year-old gymnast won the silver medal on the balance beam on Monday with major brands wanting to partner with the young girl. “I probably heard from 10 major, Fortune 100 companies as soon as she did it,” said Sheryl Shade of Shade Global told Quartz earlier this week. “They were paying attention.” It looks like one of those calls has panned out because Hernandez just got her first big endorsement deal with Procter & Gamble. She is the new Crest and Orgullosa ambassador. “My motto in life is to embrace every moment. This is such an exciting time for me and I’m so proud, Orgullosa, to be a Crest athlete,” Hernandez said in a statement. Hernandez’s mother, Wanda Hernandez, also joined the “Thank You Mom” campaign that has been ongoing throughout the Olympic season. The teenager, who is of Puerto Rican descent, is the first U.S. born Latina to be on the Olympic gymnastics team since 1984. She is also the youngest of the Final Five, who won the team gold medal in Brazil last week. “When you’re given the opportunity of a lifetime to perform on the world’s biggest stage, smiling with confidence for your family and supporters is part of every routine,” she added in her statement. “As I prep for the competition, I always count on Crest products to keep my smile radiant and flawless on and off the mat." Crest’s Orgullosa campaign is an online platform that was created to celebrate and empower Latinas. The initiative, which uses the Spanish word for “proud” as its title, will look to spotlight personal stories of the Hernandez family and the pride in their culture, traditions, and family. Procter and Gamble said they selected Hernandez as their newest ambassador because she represents a new wave of Latinas who are reshaping the face of America with orgullo (pride). “Olympian Laurie Hernandez has inspired people around the world through her talent, personality and amazing smile. We welcome Laurie to the P&G family and we’re so proud to support her as a role model for the strength and power of Latinas and their families,” said Marc Pritchard, P&G Chief Brand Officer, in a statement. Shade acknowledged that the gymnast has a strong (and growing) fan base within the Hispanic community in United States. She told Quarks that they will look to tap into Hernandez’s growing fame, not unlike other breakout Olympic stars, and keep her in the public eye through the end of the year. “After a big Olympics like this, for any athlete, those first few months you’ve got to let them put their hair down a bit and enjoy all that’s out there,” said Shade. After the Olympics, Hernandez’s goal is to qualify for the world gymnastics championships next year. In 2020, she hopes to earn a spot on the U.S. Olympic team again.

Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer Ryan Lochte’s apparent tall story about getting robbed in Rio has ruined his chances of picking up any new sponsors, sports business experts told The Post on Thursday. “Right now, sponsors will be trying to figure the real story and from there they’ll take action, but it’s difficult to navigate right now,” said sports branding expert Jarrod Moses, of United Entertainment Group. Henry Shafer, who runs Q Scores, an awareness and likability index for marketers, said Lochte’s scores are already sinking. The 32-year-old swimmer, with 12 Olympic medals, including a gold medal in the 4×200-meter relay in Rio, had “shown signs of being a polarizing personality” even before the Rio Games started, Shafer said. Lochte’s likely tall tale about being robbed by thieves posing as Rio cops has nearly overshadowed the Games themselves. As is typical in the first days after an athlete gets into trouble, marketing partners have little to say. Lochte has a long list of sponsors, including Ralph Lauren, Gatorade, Nissan, Mutual of Omaha, Speedo and Procter & Gamble, and they are likely to wait for more facts to be known before making a decision on whether to continue their relationship with the swimmer, experts said. On Thursday morning, NBC “Today” show anchor Matt Lauer said he spoke to Lochte the day before and that the athlete had told him: “We wouldn’t make this story up.” SEE ALSO Ryan Lochte is everything the world hates about Americans :0 This was late one night — actually, early one morning... Ryan Lochte is everything the world hates about Americans Only Ralph Lauren, a USOC partner, gave a statement, telling The Post it is “reviewing the situation.” That followed a press conference held by Brazilian authorities who accused Lochte and one of the three other swimmers of making up the story. Lochte, worth about $3 million, is signed to Hollywood talent shop CAA and his agent was not available to comment. Media measurement firm iSpot reports Lochte appeared in TV ads 117 times during the Games so far. “As time moves on, a lot will depend on what he says and how quickly,” Shafer said. “The longer the delay, the more negative perception and it’s harder to overcome.” In a January poll, Q Scores found Lochte was known by around 26 percent of the US population, and of those people, 10 percent said he was one of their favorite personalities. At the same time, rival Michael Phelps had a 67 percent awareness and a 12 percent Q Score. “We’ll see what happens with Lochte, it’s going to create a lot of controversy,” added Shafer, who is set to conduct a new poll on the athletes after the Games end. A separate marketing survey by Canvs, which tracks language on Twitter, shows Lochte displaying many more negative emotional reactions — such as “crazy,” “dislike,” “idiot,” “weird” and “hate,” it said. The number of tweets using the word “love” dropped from 30 percent to 20 percent.

Subscribe for $59/Yr - Save $50 Tongal Hires Former Saatchi P&G Client Lead To Woo Big Clients Emsley Joins Creative Crowdsourcer After Decades on Consumer Brands By Jack Neff. Published on August 08, 2016. Vaughan Emsley. Credit: Tongal Most Popular Tongal, the creative crowdsourcing firm that's been threatening to become the Uber of advertising for about as long as Uber has been around, has landed Saatchi & Saatchi's longtime lead Procter & Gamble Co. executive to broaden its reach with big clients. Vaughan Emsley, who handled key P&G brands for Saatchi during most of the past three decades, has joined Tongal as head of strategy and client development. He was most recently a strategic advisor to Saatchi, and before that global head of planning and transformation from 2013 to 2015. He was Saatchi's exec VP in charge of the global P&G account from 2005 to 2013. Mr. Emsley had been consulting for Tongal the past six months, already creating some buzz among marketers who knew him from P&G days, prior to coming on board as a full-time employee. The company counts P&G, Unilever, Johnson & Johnson, Colgate-Palmolive Co., Walmart's Sam's Club and other big players as clients on projects, and Mr. Emsley's appointment is about expanding such work, said Tongal co-founder and CEO Rob Salvatore. Mr. Emsley said the decision to join Tongal started really with "a health crisis" two years ago. "When I came back to work, I decided I wanted to do something very different than I'd been doing before," he said. "It took quite a while for me to find what that was going to be. One of the reasons I settled with Tongal is that I was looking at the way technology was disrupting so many businesses – be it financial trading, hotels or car hire. The question in my mind is 'Why should the communication business be immune?'" Working at Tongal actually reminds him of what the agency business was like 30 years ago, Mr. Emsley said. "That spirit has gone out of the agencies somewhat over the past 10 years or so, and I found it here. That, more than anything else, told me this has a great future." Mr. Emsley is one of about 50 employees for Tongal, founded in 2009 (the same year as Uber) and now with revenue of more than $30 million based on work of more than 120,000 "Tongalers," a combination of individual creatives and often multi-employee production houses. Mr. Salvatore expects the client-service team to grow under Mr. Emsley. "This is a very significant hire for us," he said. And while Tongal's work is now weighted more heavily toward production, Mr. Salvatore sees growth come from developing creative ideas behind the work. "Cost is only a component of it," Mr. Salvatore said. "It's the brands needing a solution that's not there. They need more content, but it needs to be authentic, relevant, targeted to the audience in the specific platform it's hosted on." The idea behind Tongal is really that "channels are diffusing toward infinite, and the shelf life is also compressing, so you're going to need a distributed workforce to do it," Mr. Salvatore said. "Our underlying thesis is that creativity is abundant and can be deployed efficiently to solve that problem." Asked if, as an agency executive, he was concerned by the competitive threat Tongal poses, Mr. Emsley said, "Yes, I would have been concerned in those days." He'll split time between New York and Tongal's Santa Monica Calif. office, where most of its employees are. Some other account management people are based closer to clients in the Midwest. "There is a huge opportunity for Tongal to become a strategic partner for clients," Mr. Emsley said. "If you combine strategic thinking with the scale of creative resources that Tongal has, and the speed and agility with which is moves, you've got a solution to the problems that many clients have had."

MUMBAI: Retention of women employees in the workforce will improve with the passage of the Maternity Benefit Amendment Bill in Rajya Sabha. The bill will more than double paid maternity leave to 26 weeks from 12 weeks. In India, the percentage of women in the workforce declines from 25% at entry level to 16% at mid-level and 4% at top levels. With the amendments identifying the need to allocate additional time to women for child rearing, experts believe this will bring down attrition levels. Saundarya Rajesh, founder-president of Avtar Group, a leading talent strategy and diversity consulting firms, said, "This will prevent at least 20% of regretted attrition of women in the age group of 25 to 35, being faced by organizations." Many progressive companies like Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Flipkart, HCL Technologies, PwC, Accenture, Procter & Gamble (P&G), Godrej and Tata Group voluntarily offer around 6 months of paid maternity leave to employees. The objective is to enhance gender diversity levels. N S Rajan, group executive council member & group chief HR officer, Tata Sons, said, "Our goal is to have 2,30,000 women employees by 2020. We are not just talking of compliance around gender diversity, or a mandate which needs adherence. We are talking of a group-wide commitment to celebrating the importance of gender diversity. Our endeavour is to remove hurdles in the way of career growth of women — be it unconscious bias or policy shortfalls." In fact, most companies offer more than the stipulated requirement. At PwC, in case of any medical exigency, an additional four weeks of leave is offered. "We have had examples in our office where women employees, even in client-facing roles, have worked from home for six months at a stretch and have still met all their deliverables," said Jagjit Singh, chief people officer, PwC India. Sonali Roychowdhury, head (HR), P&G India, said, "On top of the maternity leave, employees also have an option of adding an additional six weeks of paid vacation leave." B P Biddappa, executive director (HR), HUL, said, "It will enable women across India to integrate their personal and professional aspirations. I believe this amendment will help drive family-friendly policies that help women build seamless and satisfying careers." Prince Augustin, EVP (group human capital & leadership development), Mahindra & Mahindra, said the company is geared for the stipulated leave as it had recently enhanced its leave beyond the one provided under the Act. The company has also put a 'work out of home' policy in place. However, despite the best efforts, statistics reveal that more than 25% of Indian women in the private sector opt out of their career after child birth. "I'm sure this will facilitate the return of some very capable women back into the corporate corridors after their maternity break," said Sumit Mitra, head (HR and corporate services), Godrej Industries and associate companies. A major concern, however, is regarding the status quo on parental laws. "The government should have revised parental laws to weed out inherent biases. By not doing so, the message that is going out is 'child rearing is a woman's job alone'," said Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder & senior VP of TeamLease Services. Another concern is whether the move could be counter-productive with smaller enterprises becoming wary of hiring women. "Only a grand total of 25.5% of all employable women are in the workforce. They would range in the age group of 25 to 60. Of this group, a policy such as this will address itself to about 35% of the leave needs of the population. This shrinks the total number of beneficiaries to a rather small number. On the other hand, if the government were to encourage companies to hire more women by providing incentives for such hiring (a la Japan, which actually gives tax rebates for the hiring of second-career women), you might find the number of 25.5% jumping up by about 10 percentage points," said Rajesh. An NSSO report shows that close to 38% of women who are currently in the workforce are employed by small and medium enterprises.

Recover your password Delimiter About Delimiter Contact us Ethics Principles Privacy Site Terms Comments policy Enterprise IT News Qantas CIO jets off to Airbus By Daniel Palmer - 16/08/2016 0 news Qantas Airways’ Chief Information Officer, Luc Hennekens, is leaving the company to take on the same role at Airbus, effective 1 October. The move follows the departure of Guus Dekkers, currently CIO with Airbus and Airbus Group, who is leaving the company at the end of September, Airbus said. Qantas has previously indicated that Dekkers is leaving the role to be closer to his family, as well as to pursue an opportunity at a major company based in France. In his new role, Hennekens will be reporting to Marc Fontaine, Group Digital Transformation Officer, for Airbus Group matters, and to Tom Williams, Chief Operations Officer Airbus, for Airbus matters. Hennekens studied industrial engineering at Eindhoven University of Technology before later moving into IT. Prior to joining Qantas, he held positions at Procter & Gamble and Hewlett-Packard among others. As well as being responsible for Airbus’ IT systems, the incoming CIO will have responsibility for digital solutions for the company’s products, information and communication systems, protection against cyberattacks and more. Airbus said that, in his years with the group, Guus Dekkers and his team achieved “impressive results” in improving the company’s previously “very fragmented” IT structure. He is further credited with enabling an “efficient” design and manufacturing process at Airbus, which led to his being awarded the title of CIO of the Year in 2013 by German magazines Computerwoche and CIO-Magazin. More recently, Dekkers was behind the setting up of “one of the world’s largest high-performance computing environments”, Airbus said, and has rolled out cross divisional platforms for digital initiatives such as Big Data, cloud services, Internet of Things, 3D printing and augmented reality. “I regret Guus’ decision [to leave], but fully respect it,” said Airbus Group CEO Tom Enders. “He has been at the helm of our Information & Communication Technology function since he joined the company in 2008.” “Guus has been a pillar for the further integration of IT and communication within Airbus Group as a key business enabler,” Enders continued. “I would like to thank him for his great contribution and strong engagement during his career within the company and I wish him all the best for his professional and personal future.” Discussing the appointment of Hennekens as CIO, the CEO said: “Luc brings extensive experience from different industries in IT and transformation across the globe. During his assignment at Qantas, Luc was at the heart of digitisation and Big Data deployment in various innovative fields, for example passenger experience or performance of aircraft.” Image credit: Airbus Related posts: Qantas CIO jets off to France CIO Paul Jones flies to Qantas from Mars Qantas tech chief becomes Jetstar CEO Dumped Qantas CIO finds Leighton home Stephen Wilson leaves Qantas TAGS airbus chief information officer cio executive appointment it management qantas SHARE tweet Daniel Palmer Popular articles in Delimiter's last year 397NBN to boost HFC broadband with DOCSIS 3.1 in 2017 329Fifield invites Australians to comment: Who has the better NBN? 276Analysis by ex-NBN CTO shows NBN activation rate is actually slowing 272Cox is rolling out gigabit broadband across its US markets 271Fact check: Turnbull misleads Q&A audience on NBN 262Google Fiber shows people don’t want FTTP, says Morrow 255NZ brings FTTP costs down to FTTN levels 237The election is over, and Fibre to the Node is here to stay 232XG.FAST won’t obviate need for copper replacement, says Internet Australia 230NBN election: Labor polling voters on Coalition’s NBN performance 228NBN says customers just as happy with FTTN or FTTP 221Labor needs “a good explanation” to change NBN, says Morrow 220Move to FTTP viable but threatened by NBN monopoly, says Budde 218NBN raises possibility of multi-gigabit symmetric HFC speeds 214Read in full: Mike Quigley launches devastating critique of MTM policy 209IPA publishes anti-Labor NBN attack riddled with grievous errors 205“Fibre witch-hunt”: Budde says MTM defenders getting “desperate” 201BT FTTN network hits 25 million premises milestone 194NBN changes mind again: Some HFC suburbs to get FTTN after all 193NBN gridlock: Peak hour congestion takes down FTTN for some 192NBN G.Fast “more hype than reality”, says Budde 191The Australian newspaper launches election attack on Labor’s NBN 188For the tragedy of the NBN, Turnbull must go 188NBN statement not Coalition’s final NBN policy Policy and politics Labor slams Turnbull’s NBN “broken promises”2 months ago Stephen Conroy announces retirement from Senate2 months ago Labor colleagues pay tribute to “visionary” Conroy2 months ago Ludlam demands clarity on GST Internet filter report2 months ago Labor backs Govt’s new Joint NBN Committee2 months ago Enterprise IT [ad] Accelerating to real-time: The challenges ahead for banking transformation2 weeks ago Origin searches for Head of Cloud Services2 months ago IoT solution brings a boost to Tasmania’s oyster farms2 months ago ANZ Bank renews Optus telco deals2 months ago Programming error costs CommBank over $2.5m2 months ago IT Industry AirTree raises $250m for venture capital fund2 months ago HP adopts Microsoft Dynamics for CRM2 months ago Digital tech “critical” for massive agricultural industry growth2 months ago Simon Hackett appointed CEO of Redflow3 months ago Salesforce best place to work in Australia, survey finds3 months ago ABOUT USWelcome!

Maurice Levy Credit: Christian Alminana/Courtesy of Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity Most Popular Publicis Groupe chairman and CEO Maurice Lévy confirmed that his successor will be announced some time between December 2016 and February 2017, ahead of the French communications group's annual general meeting, which will take place in Paris in May. Speaking to analysts at Publicis Groupe's 2016 first half results presentation, Mr. Lévy added, "for the time being we are working only on internal candidates." The internal candidate everyone is watching is Arthur Sadoun, who was elevated to CEO of the Publicis Worldwide network in mid-2013 and put in charge of all the creative networks as CEO of the new Publicis Communications in a major Publicis Groupe re-org at the end of 2015. Apart from Mr. Sadoun's closely-watched tryout in key roles for Mr. Levy's job, it's unclear if any other internal candidates are being seriously considered. In an interview later with Ad Age, Mr. Levy said: "The board will start to work seriously on it as soon as September and make their decision at the end of this year, or the beginning of the next. It's the most important task the board has. Obviously they have already done a lot of background work, but it takes time. I'm not a member of the advisory board. I am there just as support. I can shed light on some situations and bring the coffee." Publicis Groupe reported organic growth (excluding acquisitions and currency swings) of 2.7% for the second quarter of the year, with revenues of $2.7 billion. Revenues for the first half of the year were $5.3 billion, up 4.6% on the first half of 2015. North America's organic growth rate was -0.1% in the second quarter, after the region was hit hard by last year's media losses. "We are working hard to mitigate the impact and to improve the situation," Mr. Lévy said. During the spate of 2015 media account reviews, Publicis Groupe lost its massive Coca-Cola account, and lost its longstanding Procter & Gamble multibillion-dollar media business to rival Omnicom Group. Related Stories Publicis Groupe Creates New Entity for Walmart to Handle U.S. Creative, In-Store Marketing Publicis Groupe Grows 2.9% in First Quarter, but Levy Warns on Second and Third Publicis' Mediavest lost the Walmart media account in February, but the group has been working to strengthen its non-media relationship with the retailer this year, and recently created a new entity to house Walmart's U.S. creative and in-store advertising, as well as some non-advertising duties including technology and corporate reputation. "We will feel the full impact of the losses in North America in the third and fourth quarters," Mr. Levy told Ad Age. "For example, the P&G loss will impact only from July 1." Publicis Groupe's Saatchi & Saatchi won Walmart-owned Asda's $145 million U.K. business without a pitch in April. And earlier this month Publicis Groupe and Walmart began creating a new entity to house the retailer's U.S. creative and in-store advertising, along with other pieces of business that do not involve advertising. "What we have to do is develop an even more collaborative approach between agencies and work with the Power of One concept big time," Mr. Levy added. "We've had a few wins and we will feel the benefit from the big Walmart [account] as soon as the fall. I'm confident the situation in the U.S. will be recovered pretty quickly. Next year we will benefit from all our efforts and the work we have done." Saatchi & Saatchi was also this week named as one of GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare's two largest global communications partners, alongside WPP's Grey Worldwide. The consumer healthcare giant reviewed its business following a merger with Novartis Consumer Health, with which Saatchi & Saatchi had an existing relationship. Publicis Groupe, whose agencies include Leo Burnett, Saatchi & Saatchi, Bartle Bogle Hegarty, StarcomMediaVest and Zenithoptimedia, saw its second quarter results boosted by a strong performance in Europe, where organic growth reached 7.3% in the second quarter, and 5.5% for the first half of the year. For the second half of the year, digital growth in the region was 12.5%, while Germany and Italy both grew around 9%. Mr. Lévy spoke on the call with analysts about the impact of last month's shock Brexit decision, when the U.K. voted in a referendum to leave the European Union. "We are in 'terra incognita' because nobody knows exactly what will happen. We know that there is not a clear plan ... There is a blank sheet of paper and we have to build a solution, " he said. "After the emotion, I believe that everyone will work extremely positively toward the future … and Europe will be much stronger and more united … and the U.K. will have to find a way to leave the EU." "We believe that if there is a deterioration it will come very progressively and it will not be a sharp decrease of any indicator ... It is not impossible that at the end of the day things will remain relatively stable." (And Europeans will continue to take their traditional August vacations; Mr. Levy leaves in 10 days for his own summer break, in Provence and then trekking in the mountains.) In Asia Pacific, organic growth was 5.5% in the second quarter. In Latin America, it reached 4.8% and in Middle East & Africa it was down -1.5%. Digital growth across the group in the first half of the year was 6.3%, reaching 23% in Asia Pacific, 12.5% in Europe and 10.7% in the Middle East and Africa. Latin America, at 0.9%, was the only region to show any analog growth, with analog across the group down by -0.8%.

Black Family Reunion marries faith, food, music Mark Curnutte , mcurnutte@enquirer.com 4:17 p.m. EDT August 18, 2016 Buy Photo Cynthia and Paul Booth are the Midwest Black Family Reunion's Family of the Year. The three-day event is August 19-21. The couple have been married 36 years. Their kids are Martin, 25 left, and Paul Booth Jr., 34. The event started in Cincinnati in 1989. (Photo: The Enquirer/ Liz Dufour)Buy Photo Paul and Cynthia Booth have donated their time and money to the Midwest Black Family Reunion since its beginning in 1989. The Booths gave freely because of their belief in the core mission of the annual event: to promote the strengths, traditions, values and coping skills of the black family and dispel negative contemporary myths and stereotypes of its demise. The Cincinnati event is the nation's longest-running Black Family Reunion. The 28th annual celebration will be Friday through Sunday at Sawyer Point and other locations throughout Greater Cincinnati. The Booths, of Amberley Village, will be honored as Midwest Black Family Reunion's Family of the Year. The overall event features three days of activities and traditions central to the black family: faith, food, music — adding up to togetherness. It transforms Sawyer Point into a carnival midway, where fun and games balance the serious, such as a Sunday morning religious service and two days worth of free screenings that address race-based health disparities. Buy Photo  (Photo: The Enquirer/Liz Dufour) Today, some outsiders allege the black family has deteriorated and thus created economic and social problems among African-Americans. Yet the Booths and others inside the black community say the black family remains resilient and vital. “The state of the black family is not different than any other ethnicity, any other family," said Paul Booth Sr., 62, a former two-time Cincinnati City Council member and Congressional aide to David Mann. "That being said, does the black family have some work to do? Yes. "That’s what the Black Family Reunion is all about: going back to our roots. The Black Family Reunion is no different than the Hispanic Festival or the Oktoberfest. It celebrates the legacy of the black family.” He and his wife, married for 36 years, said they held fast to their forebears' traditions, family meals and family prayer among them. "I hope the black family never loses the ability to pray," said Cynthia Booth, owner of six regional McDonald's franchises that ring the Interstate 275 beltline and employs 400 people. "No matter the trials and tribulations they face, I hope they can still pray. It sustains us. The family becomes stronger through prayer. "There is not a time that our children have not heard us pray, collectively, and for them. We are constantly praying for their well-being and their futures. Prayer has been a very strong force in the black family and needs to take even a greater role as we try to sustain ourselves." The "total of community'   The late Dorothy I. Height, president emerita of the National Council of Negro Women, created the Black Family Reunion. The first, held on the National Mall in 1986, was sponsored by Cincinnati-based Procter & Gamble. The second was held three years later in Cincinnati. In a 2008 interview with The Enquirer, Height said she came up with the reunion concept after watching a Bill Moyers' television documentary titled "The Vanishing Black Family." She said the documentary focused only on teen pregnancy, not unique to the black community but society as a whole. Instead of protesting, she said, Height wanted to create something positive. "We felt we needed to show the total of the black family, to celebrate our historic strengths and valued traditions that have kept us alive," she told The Enquirer. Cincinnati is the only Black Family Reunion remaining of the original dozen-plus that were held across the country in major markets that included Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles. Outside of Cincinnati, the only other Black Family Reunion is held in a small city in north-central Illinois, Rockford, where its chapter of the National Council of Negro Women has since organized an annual event. Thirty years after the Moyers' 1986 documentary aired, the black family remains under assault from some corners of American society. Critics point to a 2013 report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showing that 72 percent of births to non-Hispanic black women occur outside of marriage. Yet the same report shows that black fathers were statistically the most involved with their children on a daily basis than any other group of fathers – whether black fathers lived with their children or at another home – in a number of measurable areas: helping their children with homework, discussing events of children's days with them, taking them to and from activities outside the home, and frequency of eating meals with them. The black family and black church are two institutions that have helped to sustain African-Americans in the face of economic, educational and health disparities, said the Rev. K.Z. Smith, pastor of Avondale's Corinthian Baptist Church, host church of the Midwest Black Family Reunion. "The two are linked, the family and the church," he said. "As long as I can remember, it was rare to find black children who didn't go to church. Even if the parents didn't go, they made sure their children did." Yet as the black middle class grew, Smith said, dependence on the church waned and some parents no longer require their children to go to services. Buy Photo  (Photo: The Enquirer/Liz Dufour) The Midwest Family Reunion, if nothing else, aims to cement that bond between the black family and the black church Friday's lead-off event, the Heritage Breakfast, will be held at The Word of Deliverance Ministries for the World, Inc., in Forest Park and will feature a keynote address by national civil rights leader the Rev. Otis Moss Jr., one-time pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church in Lockland. Sunday morning starts at the reunion with an outdoor service at Sawyer Point. This year, it will feature Pastor Donnie McClurkin, of Perfecting Faith Ministries in Freeport, New York, and a prominent gospel music artist. Attendees can be baptized during the service. For more black families than not, like the Booths, they said, the church remains an integral part of life. The next generation Paul and Cynthia Booth are members of Greater New Hope Missionary Baptist Church, Avondale. It was there in 2007 that Paul Booth Jr. was ordained. The 34-year-old pastor and his wife, Asha, now have a new daughter, 4-month-old Laila. He also has a new church, start-up Legacy Pointe in Kenwood. Paul Jr. is a sixth-generation minister in the Booth family, a string that skipped only Paul Sr. and whose most notable member is Paul Sr.'s father, the late Lavaughn Venchael (L.V.) Booth, a national pioneer in black church-based economic and community development. ENQUIRER Local - The Enquirer - February 20, 1998 Paul Booth Jr. has inherited the even demeanor of a preacher beneath which burns intensity and conviction: calling out the media for focusing more on the shortcomings of the black family than its greater number of achievements, praising the historic and enduring work ethic of African-Americans and strong desire of his people to be educated and achieve. He and his now 25-year-old brother Martin both attended Cincinnati Hills Christian Academy. Paul Jr. then earned a political science degree from DePauw University in Green Castle, Indiana, before moving to Atlanta and finishing a master's degree in divinity at Emory University. "We're living in some challenging times where the family unit as we know it, both socially and politically," he said. "And the black family is not enduring any challenges other families are not. But what is covered is what is highlighted and resonates in peoples' minds. I believe that the foundation of the black family is very strong." Martin Booth — named after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., an associate of his minister grandfather — earned an undergraduate business degree from Wake Forest University before moving to Atlanta, where he worked as an account manager at Coca-Cola Enterprises. He recently returned to Cincinnati to work in the family business running McDonald's restaurants but plans to pursue an MBA beginning next year at the University of Chicago or Northwestern University. "We, as the black family, as you sit and listen to us, we don't want to be viewed as the exception, we want to be viewed as the norm," Martin Booth said. "I believe, going back to how we're viewed on television, that's what we're seen as. We have to educate people as to what you stand for. The black family is strong. We are intelligent. We are hard-working. We are constantly trying to break-down barriers and advance ourselves. "I don't think our values are an exception. I think it's based on the opportunities you are granted. I think what we have tried to do is try to live out the values we were taught at home." 2016 MIDWEST BLACK FAMILY REUNION SCHEDULE OF EVENTS (highlights) Friday 8:30-10:30 a.m. Doors open 8 a.m.: Heritage Breakfast and Opening Ceremony, The Word of Deliverance Ministries for the World, Inc., 693 Fresno Road, Forest Park.

US stocks closed slightly higher yesterday, 17 August 2016, sharply paring earlier losses, as minutes from the Federal Reserve's July meeting showed policy makers remain divided on prospects for a near-term rate increase. Stocks bounced off session lows after St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said that with US growth trending below 2%, interest rates can stay low. Most FMCG shares edged higher.

Shares of state-run power transmission major Power Grid Corporation of India were up 3.04% at Rs 179.85. The company said in an investor presentation on the first quarter results submitted to the stock exchanges that it is implementing projects worth about Rs 1.13 lakh crore (as of July 2016). It has identified new projects worth about Rs 15000 crore. The total works in hand is about Rs 1.44 lakh crore. Reliance Industries (RIL) was up 0.4% at Rs 1,018.05. With reference to news item suggesting that the oil ministry slapped $250 million profit petroleum penalty on RIL, the company clarified during market hours today, 18 August 2016, that the issue is an ongoing dispute on disallowance of cost recovery by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG). The dispute started in 2011 and is currently under arbitration in accordance with provisions of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). The parties to arbitration are Contractor Group (RIL, BP and NIKO) and Government of India (through MoPNG). Every year, based on its own interpretations of the PSC and assumptions (with which the Contractor Group does not agree), MoPNG revises the total cost it proposes to disallow and consequently aggregates the figure with the figures of the previous years. It also demands additional profit petroleum (in total including previous year claims as well) as GoI share. Upto financial year 2013-2014, the cost recovery proposed to be disallowed was $2.376 billion and consequent demand of Government of India (GoI) share of additional profit petroleum of $195.3 million on cumulative basis. On 3 June 2016, the company received a revised claim upto year 2014-2015 with a disallowance of $2.756 billion on cumulative basis and consequent demand of GoI share of additional profit petroleum of $246.90 million, also on cumulative basis. The number mentioned in the headline of the news item is a cumulative figure since commencement of the dispute. RIL also clarified that GoI has already collected gross $81.7 million in Gas Pool Account, towards the aforesaid claim. RIL reiterated that all claims made by GoI are denied by the Contractor Group and currently part of an ongoing arbitration. Maruti Suzuki India rose 0.94% to Rs 4,936.65 on reports that a domestic brokerage has upgraded its rating on the stock to buy from add with target price of Rs 5,800 per share. The brokerage reportedly said that Maruti Suzuki India (Maruti) is miles ahead of competition amongst peers. The brokerage sees early signs of improvement in pricing for Maruti. It further added that Maruti is well placed to gain market share and recovery in demand will result in pricing power. Indian Bank jumped 5.37% to Rs 228.65 after a bulk deal of 10.18 lakh shares was executed on the scrip at Rs 225.50 per share at 09:41 IST on BSE.

It’s even harder to lose gracefully. Take the U.S. women’s soccer team: After their tough loss last week to Sweden in the quarterfinals at the Rio Olympics, the women were crushed. “We were initially shocked, disappointed, hurt and heartbroken,” team forward Alex Morgan tells PEOPLE. “It was like a bad dream. It was just crushing.” But since that shocking loss, Morgan says she has taken a more philosophical approach to her disappointment. The 27-year-old sat down with PEOPLE at the P&> Family Home in Rio, a sanctuary that supports athletes and their families throughout the games. “It was horrible, but I do feel like I learned a lot more from losing than from winning,” Morgan says. “I was able to pick myself up, which is so important to do after a game. I feel like the next time we win, it will be that much sweeter because we know what it feels like to lose.” “Obviously, it was really hard,” she says. “But winning and losing isn’t everything; sometimes, the journey is just as important as the outcome.” For more of PEOPLE’s Olympic coverage, pick up our collector’s edition, The Best of the Games, on sale now. Despite controversial anti-Sweden comments from teammate Hope Solo, Morgan has a different approach to losing. “I saw her comments, but I feel like those are opinions I don’t share,” she told USA Today. “I think it’s important to keep things positive,” Morgan tells PEOPLE. “Sometimes you don’t win, and that sucks, and you work on improving.” WATCH: Soccer Superstar Alex Morgan Reveals How Sports Changed Her Life Alex Morgan Maddie Meyer Playing ‘Like A Girl’ With her Rio journey behind her, Morgan is hoping to be a role model to younger women. She has teamed up with Always for the #LikeAGirl campaign, which encourages girls to play sports. “Whenever people say ‘women’s soccer,’ I want to correct them to say ‘soccer.’ ” Morgan says. “Every girl has had their sport diminished because they’re girls.” The purpose of the campaign is to educate girls and young women about their sports options as they reach puberty and beyond. For Morgan, the campaign is working. “The attitudes have definitely shifted,” she says. “When people say, ‘You run like a girl, you play like a girl,’ it’s not what it used to be. “That shouldn’t be negative. You should be proud to play like a girl. We’re shifting the way people think about us.” Show Full Article See Also More People Logo Homeless, Track-Running Brooklyn Sisters are Sport's Illustrated Kids' SportsKids of the Year Steph Curry Trades Autographed Jerseys with 7-Year-Old with Leukemia: ‘This Is His Wish’ Gabby Douglas Reflects On Her Rio Critics: ‘It Didn’t Ruin My Experience, But It Made It Harder’ Cubs Slugger Anthony Rizzo Sends Signed Jersey to Family Who Adopted ‘Rizzo the Dog’ Kate Upton Gets Salty on Twitter After Fiancé Justin Verlander Loses Cy Young Award Load More Stories Most Popular 1 Khloé Kardashian Joins Boyfriend Tristan Thompson for Hometown Turkey Drive Ahead of Thanksgiving 2 Homeless, Track-Running Brooklyn Sisters are Sport's Illustrated Kids' SportsKids of the Year 3 Nicole Johnson Phelps Wants Another Baby with Husband Michael: 'Of Course We Have Plans!' 4 Dennis Rodman Charged with Hit-and-Run After Freeway Incident 5 Steph Curry Trades Autographed Jerseys with 7-Year-Old with Leukemia: ‘This Is His Wish’ See Also People Facebook Tumblr Instagram Pinterest YouTube Google+ Copyright © 2016 Time Inc.

The swimmer, who won a gold medal in the men’s 4x200m freestyle relay in Rio de Janeiro, has struggled to stay on top of a mugging story he told his mother that has since snowballed into an international incident. Officials in Brazil, eager to protect the nation’s reputation as a safe one for foreign travelers, are now contending that the mugging never happened, pointing to footage from a gas station and from security at the Olympic Village. And while Lochte made it back to the U.S. without incident, two of his teammates were detained in Rio for further questioning about the possibly false claims of a crime. NBC anchors Bob Costas and Matt Lauer discussed Lochte’s story with a gravity usually reserved for armed insurrections. Their tone was in stark contrast to everything else about the bleached-blond 32-year-old, an active tweeter and E! celeb who, in addition to a dozen Olympic medals, might best be known for the catchphrase “jeah” (which he tried, and failed, to trademark). Even the story of the mugging is farcical; the way he tells it, when a mugger pointed a gun at his forehead, Lochte’s response was, “Whatever.” Lauer and Costas were trying to bridge the gap between international incident, celebrity gossip, journalistic integrity, and the unabashed pro-American bias the network brings to its Olympics coverage. All things considered, they acquitted themselves pretty well; in some ways, because Lochte wasn’t present, it was easier for Lauer and Costas to frame the situation appropriately. (Lochte has proven to be skilled at digging himself ever-deeper.) Costas, in particular, is an anchor who has managed to retain integrity despite being embedded in a news organization that at times feels like circus music is playing in the background. Although it was, and still is, very funny that Lochte’s story appears to have been a terrible and mostly harmless fabrication, the seriousness with which NBC approached it was a reminder of how historically and culturally significant the Olympics are — and, arguably, should be, given how much money and time is devoted to its expression of global unity. And the blowup around Lochte, just a few days before Rio 2016’s Closing Ceremonies, has been a stark reminder of just how much the world has changed — and how NBC, as the arbiter of the American narrative of the Olympics, occasionally struggles to keep up. One of the reasons NBC always seems to be scrambling during the Olympics is because every winter and summer Games is a biennial trial-by-fire with completely different circumstances, whether that’s not enough snow in Sochi or a massive time difference to Sydney. Furthermore, the team of commentators, talking heads, and on-the-scene producers only get three weeks every two years to do what they do. It makes for a motley crew, sometimes; Rio 2016 was populated by a surprising number of winter sports athletes, including figure skaters Johnny Weir and Tara Lipinski, who introduced audiences to carnivale, and snowboarder Shaun White, who was there to… talk about his music, I guess? Add to that the network’s strangely prevalent cutaway to Ryan Seacrest, hanging out on Copacabana Beach for some reason, and the American presence in Rio felt like a hastily assembled theater troupe. So while I dinged the network last week for how it chose to broadcast the team gymnastics competition, I’ll allow that as Rio 2016 has progressed, NBC’s coverage has grown more confident. It specifically gained facility switching from live events to taped events to accommodate the slim one-hour time difference between Rio and the East Coast. Furthermore, as the hectic initial flush of excitement about the games wore off, the coverage settled into actually sticking with a sport for hours at a time, providing that lived-in experience with an obscure sport and far-flung countries’ athletes that is so essential to the Olympics. But despite that, gymnastics continued to present a problem for NBC — both practically and, dare I say it, semiotically. Gymnastics is a sport that Americans only tune into en masse once every four years, and furthermore, the stars are the women, not the men. It fits into a typically feminized pursuit of externally determined perfection, which was even more pronounced in the days when a gymnast could actually score a perfect 10. NBC’s chief marketing officer John Miller created a bit of a stir in advance of the Opening Ceremonies when he said that female viewers, who tend to watch the Olympics (and, I’ll add, are drawn to gymnastics), want to watch not a sporting event but a reality-TV miniseries. It’s not exactly news that a marketing executive might sound reductive and patronizing about a demographic, but Miller’s remarks belie just how significant female viewership is for Olympics ratings. It also gives lie to the type of narratives around female athletes that NBC might deem palatable for its audience. The network and its ad partners have been very invested in creating media narratives for the American women gymnasts that appeal to a domestic demographic — Proctor & Gamble, and in particular, Tide, focused on Simone Biles and Gabby Douglas and their relationships to their mothers for a recurring spot. (Indeed, given how difficult NBC made it to actually watch the gymnastics competitions in primetime, it was actually easier for children with a pre-11 p.m. bedtime to watch Biles in her Tide advertisement than it was to watch her win her four gold medals.) This pointedly housewifely framing is in sharp contrast to the history of gymnastics, which like hockey was a proxy for Cold War tensions. And this fuzzy sentiment has spilled over freely to the male commentators. During the balance beam final earlier this week for example, commentator Al Trautwig aww-ed over Dutch competitor Saane Wevers, who grabbed a pink notebook immediately after finishing the fantastic beam routine (which would eventually win her the gold). He said that he could only assume it was a diary to gush over her own performance. Color commentator Nastia Liukin, an Olympic gold medalist herself, corrected Trautwig — pointing out that Wevers, who is 24, was using the pink notebook not to pour out her girlish thoughts and feelings but instead to calculate her score. (Trautwig, to his credit, took it in stride.) And just Thursday night, NBC commentator and golfer David Feherty described Majlinda Kelmendi, the 25-year-old judoist that snagged the first ever gold for Kosovo, as “some daddy’s little girl.” (This was after he implied, charmingly, that he watched women’s beach volleyball primarily for the bikinis.) NBC wants to both showcase women athletes and attract female viewers, but it’s guilty of doing so through condescension. It’s puzzling, because while some Olympian women are still teenagers, most, especially American ones, are young disciplined women in their own right. Of course parents and partners are important, but it’s the women themselves that are not just essential to the Olympics but are in fact, the entire draw for viewers. Because the real story of this Olympics — and maybe of this era of Olympic Games — has been about the women. At New York Magazine, Ann Friedman wrote about how the Olympics has been proof positive of the Shine Theory — that notion that individual women succeed when all women succeed. That’s a notion that is, of course, antithetical to the entire concept of the Olympics, which is about competition and one-upmanship. And yet this Olympics has been flooded with women from many different countries who are, in stark contrast to the epic feud between Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding, not just friendly but actively supporting each other. The most iconic image from this Olympics might be not any winner on a podium or a champion seizing victory but American runner Abbey D’Agostino helping up New Zealand runner Nikki Hamblin during a qualifying heat for the 5000m. And this narrative of feminine cooperation is especially significant given that it’s been an incredible Olympics for African-American women in particular, from Biles’ stack of medals and history-making swimmer Simone Manuel to the U.S. team sweeping all three medal spots for the 100m hurdles. In comparison to the buffoonery of Lochte — and the open sulking of Michael Phelps in warm-up — you have Katie Ledecky cheering on Manuel and Aly Raisman and Biles holding hands, hugging, and crying as results were called. It’s moments like this that make the Lochte story stand out in such amusing contrast; the seriousness and sportsmanship of the women, in comparison to what might be egregious idiocy, if not an outright crime, on the part of four male swimmers. As these Olympics close, the careful treatment of Lochte suggests that maybe NBC is finally understanding where the future of these games are. Not with the cavalier, empty-headed jocks, blond or otherwise, but with these heartfelt and disciplined women, who seem to inherently understand the context and importance of the Olympic Games. At the very least, based on the expressions on Matt Lauer and Bob Costas’ faces, we have a very clear idea of which Olympians can be taken seriously, and which ones are destined to be forgotten.

More importantly, it ignores Hope Solo, who continues to make a disgrace of herself and perpetuate the Ugly American stereotype. There have been Americans who have represented the country well and far fewer who have embarrassed us. But let’s not pretend determining which is which is as easy as looking at the athlete’s gender.

Comments? Criticisms? Ideas for future columns? Email me, or drop a note in the comments. More Economics If you were an American man working full-time in 1984, you earned, on average, a bit more than $22 an hour (adjusted for inflation to 2014 dollars). If you were particularly ambitious, or particularly in need of cash, you could make more money by working more hours, but on a per-hour basis, you’d still be making about the same — a bit more than $22 per hour. Fast-forward to 2015, though, and the picture looks a lot different. The average man working a typical full-time job, 35 to 49 hours a week, now earns about $26 an hour. But the man working 50 hours a week or more now earns close to $33 an hour.1 Hourly pay has risen more than twice as fast over the past three decades for men working long hours, as employers increasingly reward employees willing to work extra hours with raises or promotions. (The pattern crosses educational and industry lines, and holds when excluding overtime pay.) Notice that I said “men.” Men make up a bit more than half the full-time workforce, but they account for more than 70 percent of those working 50 hours a week or more. So as wage gains have gone disproportionately to people working long hours, they have also gone disproportionately to men, widening the earnings divide between men and women overall. The gender wage gap has narrowed significantly over the past 50 years. In 1964, according to data from the Census Bureau, the typical woman working full time made about 59 cents on the dollar earned by a man; by 2004, that had risen to 77 cents. (These calculations don’t take into account differences in experience, industry or other factors.) More recently, however, progress for women has nearly stalled out: In 2014, the latest data available, women earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by men, a 2-pennies-an-hour improvement over a decade.2 Other measures of women’s progress in the workforce — their rate of employment, the likelihood that they will work in a historically male-dominated field, the rate at which they run big companies — show a similar pattern of what researchers Martha J. Bailey and Thomas A. DiPrete, in a new essay, call “five decades of remarkable but slowing change” for American women. Bailey and DiPrete’s essay serves as the introduction to a remarkable new collection of papers from the Russell Sage Foundation that examines the progress that women have — and haven’t — made over the past half-century. It isn’t a simple story. The U.S. has already made major, albeit incomplete, progress on many of the most obvious causes of gender inequality — explicit discrimination on pay,3 overt barriers to employment, taboos against working while raising children. What is left is a tangle of cultural norms, implicit biases, individual preferences and other, subtler forms of discrimination that are much harder to change or even to measure. Take the long-hours anecdote I described above. The rapid rise in pay for people working long hours has played a major role in the persistence of the overall gender wage gap, particularly for parents; new research in the Russell Sage Foundation volume estimates that the wage gap between mothers and fathers would be 15 percent smaller if the extra-hours increase hadn’t occurred. But that premium itself isn’t the result of discrimination, explicit or implicit; women who work long hours have seen even faster gains than men (although they still earn less on average). Rather, the trend contributes to the wage gap because men are so much more likely than women to work those long hours. That, in turn, is the result of a confluence of factors that are deeply embedded in the American economy and society: Women, on average, spend much more time than men on housework, while men — especially a certain category of highly educated, elite men — are expected to work as much as possible. And of course, most importantly, mothers are still far more likely than fathers to be the primary caregiver for their children. Government policies could make a difference — affordable child care, for example, could make it easier for women who want to work long hours to do so — but they can only go so far. The Russell Sage Foundation papers are full of such thorny issues. A rising share of the gender wage gap is driven by “pre-market” factors such as choice of industry and occupation; those issues can also be the result of explicit or implicit discrimination but are much harder to address than wage differentials within a given job. And even forces that should help close the gap, such as education, have proved insufficient: Women have for decades been more likely to attend college than men — there are now for the first time more female than male college graduates — yet the pay gap is widest among the most educated workers. Girls now outperform boys in many science and math subjects in high school, but women are still much less likely than men to work in many of the most lucrative technical fields; women have actually lost ground to men in computer science in recent decades. And the overall rate of “occupational desegregation” — women entering traditionally male-dominated fields and vice versa — has slowed. There are some encouraging signs for women. Those who do go into science and technology fields earn nearly as much as equally experienced men (though that isn’t true in computer science), suggesting the overall wage gap would narrow if more women entered so-called STEM fields. Moreover, the “motherhood penalty” — the relative decline in wages for women when they have children — has disappeared or even reversed for highly paid, highly educated women, perhaps because they are the most likely to have access to (and be able to afford) child care. That suggests that making child care more widely available could help narrow the gender pay gap for less-educated women, too — something that is looking more likely now that both major presidential candidates are advocating affordable-child-care plans. Culture is changing, too: Men are taking on a larger share of child-rearing responsibilities, though the division is still far from equal. Still, the overall picture painted by the Russell Sage Foundation research is one of slow, grinding and unsteady progress, and of barriers that are hard to define and even harder to resolve. Hillary Clinton may be poised to crack the ultimate glass ceiling, but true gender equality remains a long way off. The Olympic tax Speaking of high-earning (and high-flying) women, the internet was abuzz this week with stories about the hefty tax bill that gymnast Simone Biles and other Olympic medalists will face when they get back from Rio. The BBC estimated Biles will owe more than $40,000. A bipartisan bill to exempt Olympic winnings from taxes is gaining momentum in Congress. But the whole issue is getting blown out of proportion. The U.S. Olympics Committee awards bonuses to American medal winners: $25,000 for gold medals and smaller amounts for silver and bronze. Biles, with her five medals, will receive $110,000, which in theory could put her on the hook for more than $40,000 in taxes. (The medals themselves are also taxable, but their actual value is modest.) But it’s unlikely she’ll actually owe that much because Biles and other Olympians can deduct the cost of their training on their taxes. And in the case of high-profile Olympians such as Biles and swimmer Michael Phelps, their actual winnings are dwarfed by far more lucrative (and very much taxable) endorsement deals. By the time Biles cashes all those checks from Procter & Gamble, her Olympic tax bill will probably look like a rounding error. The Fed Newly released minutes from the Federal Reserve’s July meeting this week suggest that Board Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues are still weighing whether to raise interest rates in September or wait until the economy improves further. Separate comments from key Fed officials this week indicated that new data since the Fed’s meeting hasn’t resolved the question. The Fed is in a tricky spot. The job market continues to show strength; May’s weak employment report looks more and more like a blip. But overall economic growth has been disappointing, and there have been recent signs that consumer spending — a key pillar of strength in recent months — is beginning to weaken. Then there is the election, which complicates the Fed’s task in two ways: Policymakers don’t want to intervene too close to the election, lest they appear to be trying to influence the outcome, and they also have to grapple with the possibility that the election itself, and the uncertainty around it, will affect the economy. Most economists still think the Fed will wait until after the election is over to raise rates. Number of the week Back in July, I wrote about the long-term decline in teen summer employment, particularly among lower-income youths. A report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week indicates the recovery is gradually reversing that decline: 53.2 percent of Americans ages 16 to 24 had jobs in July, up from 52.7 percent last year and 50.7 percent in 2013. The report didn’t break out teens specifically, but a look at the underlying data shows that the employment rate for teens rose, too. Moreover, the employment gap between low-income and more affluent teens narrowed somewhat, the latest sign that the improving economy is gradually benefiting the most vulnerable workers. More from us It’s pretty widely known at this point that hosting the Olympics is a lousy investment for a city to make. But the games look even worse compared to other big infrastructure projects, writes Clay Dillow in his FiveThirtyEight debut. The debate over trade used to be focused on Mexico. These days, it’s all about China. Andrew Flowers says the shift in focus is rooted in some pretty solid economic evidence. On Tuesday, I spent an hour on the radio talking with Krys Boyd of KERA in Dallas about FiveThirtyEight’s big recent project on gun deaths. Elsewhere Wal-Mart’s cost-saving mania is great for consumers and investors. Less so for local police departments, who are struggling to respond to the crimes that occur in the stores every day, write Shannon Pettypiece and David Voreacos in Bloomberg Businessweek. Antitrust law tends to focus on monopolies’ impact on consumers. But economist Marshall Steinbaum argues the increasing consolidation of many U.S. industries also contributes to rising inequality. The most widely cited measure of poverty among grade-school students — eligibility for free and reduced price lunch — substantially understates the level of inequality in the U.S. school system, writes Susan Dynarski in The Upshot. The Los Angeles Times takes a deep look at U.S. poverty and how Americans view it. CORRECTION (Aug. 19, 10:22 a.m.): An earlier version of a chart in this article was incorrectly labeled. It shows the gender-pay gap in terms of annual earnings, not hourly earnings. Footnotes These calculations are based on my own analysis of Current Population Survey microdata, via the Center for Economic Policy Research. The approach is based on that used by Kim A. Weeden, Youngjoo Cha and Mauricio Bucca in their forthcoming paper from the Russell Sage Foundation. Other data sources and definitions show somewhat different ratios but the same basic trend. Estimates for the amount of outright wage discrimination — a woman making less than an equally qualified man in the same job — vary by industry and by who is doing the analysis. But most economists agree on two things: The gap is much smaller than it used to be but hasn’t disappeared.

We shall use a campaign built for managing brand Goodluck Jonathan at some point, in the last dispensation, themed “… I Goodluck…Goodluck Jonathan…” May we bring to our recall that political campaigns are brands management tools; political ideas and flag bearers/contestants for given political offices are brands. Political parties have identities, competing with other political parties (‘market’ players), to satisfy identified needs…and seek patronage at a price. Like products and services brands, politicians need to create the desired impression that will sell them at the market place for competitive advantage(s). They should carefully craft their market and marketing objectives for enduring market position – leadership, competitive followership or laggards. All of the above underscores the reasons for engaging professional brand managers. For any brand to succeed, the process and quality of campaign/advertising, and marketing communication is very important. In addition, the extent and quality of brand management also impacts on the nature, extent and robustness of targeted audience persuasion, belief, involvement and engagement. The first time I saw the television advert “I AM GOODLUCK…GOODLUCK JONATHAN…”  I ‘enjoyed’ it – for many reasons. It hit me with a dazzle, from various angles. From the position of the ordinary television audience, it paints the picture of a politician aspiring to the office of presidency, offering himself for election. In doing so, the politician is encouraging the target listener to HOPE, by telling his own success story. His own story served as HOPE to his audience: presently deprived and lacking in so many respects, almost giving up. But the aspirant comes on to rekindle their hope. He encouraged them so much, and promised them that ‘because I did it, you too can do it’. From the perspective of professional brand management, however, it was more engaging as I saw that advert time and again. It made for a good opportunity to consider some imperatives in brands management; the ingredients for effective and persuasive communication. For the purpose of building up instructive contrast (and for the benefit of consumers of advertising products) let’s look at a product advert in this market, to enable a critical consideration for learning. Though the BABA BLUE TV commercial has been rested for some time, it readily comes to mind for its creative treatment. To wit, BABA BLUE TV Commercial is a concept built on value-driven communication for the establishment of (the) brand’s promise. By use of drama, the commercial aptly played out the reasons-for for brand BABA BLUE, a brand of candy with the added value of cold treatment. We won’t drive too far into analysing the TVC’s creative and strategic focus & thrust, to avoid selling the brand free on this page, but suffice that the creative product aired for the brand is a product of a creative process that adhered to some of the grand rules for effective advertising and marketing communication. For effective brand benefit communication, the creative process for any brand communication requires a clear understanding of prevalent market learning inclusive of the need to satisfy, consumer or target audience expectation/ traits and habits, activities of competition, prevalent market dynamics that should there-from help in determining desired own-brand’s positioning statement and creative inputs for developing the way forward. Choice of words and pictures are derived from a careful consideration of the above, on a step-by-step approach. By the tutelage some of us professionals were exposed to, being aware of the above-mentioned, alone, amounts to just about 60 percent of the requirements for objective-driven engagement; an understanding of methods of application is very important. As a rule, the process does not permit assumption.  The BABA BLUE creative team seem to have applied ample understanding of the target audience – the low class man and woman who will passively take in “sweet” and move on; they are jolly-good fellows who are given to drama/comedy. They will appreciate some comic slice-of-life treatment of otherwise serious situation. Therefore, each time the TVC is aired, it immediately endears friendship from among its target audience because of the relief it brings into their lives (by use of drama), the enlightenment and information, and above all, the brand promise it establishes FIRMLY. For effectiveness, the creative process must be single-minded in its objective and creative treatment. In this case, literary treatment is very important. The advert copy/script must avoid ambiguity and emphasise clarity. So, again you find that the BABA BLUE concept played out in the courtroom setting, and clearly established its value-essence and promise through a very concise PROBLEM-SOLUTION treatment. The news here is that the creative concept behind BABA BLUE is the vintage PROCTER & GAMBLE character. The group’s endearing copy strategy is one of the first official hand-over(s) we got when we worked on the Euro Pampers and Vicks Lemon Plus brands, time past. It observes the rules for effective brands communication. Perhaps the team that worked on the “I AM GOODLUCK…” TVC needed to look into the P&G copy strategy. What came out strong in that creative product is an over-play on emotion. Yes, we appreciate the fact that creative concept can rest on either rational or emotional appeal, but even when campaigns are built on emotion, those involved must be careful not to lose focus on set-objective(s) and target audience profile. The brand must not come confused in terms of reasons-why. Credibility suffered a hit on the part of Brand Jonathan, and the target audience safeguard against credulity was undermined by the creative team behind that project. There was no way the brand would have been believed with both gender across all age-brackets saying “I am Goodluck Jonathan…” – let us leave out the other deliveries on that commercial, to save time. A lot of people who listened to that commercial came out asking wetin be this? So we ask WHO MANAGES YOUR BRAND? How much of the understanding of the creative process resides in the team you engage for the management of your brand. The lesson here, once again, is that the size of your brand’s market success depends also on the quality of your creative team and process. If the mix is right, the brand, the consumer/target audience and indeed the investor gains. Otherwise, everybody suffers. That is why we bother. Our suggestion is for brand owners/managers to rethink their choice of brand managers. We emphasise the need to engage professionals instead of “businessmen” in the business of advertising, if they desire to be competitive, customer-centric for market success, good returns on their advertising investment. On the ‘I AM GOODLUCK…GOODLUCK JONATHAN…’ campaign, which we have looked at as a case study, we would rather that the readers fill in the gap, using the BABA BLUE learning aid, to avoid being seen as partisan. We are only looking at the need for deep thinking for consumer-friendly creative advert products.   Facebook Twitter Google+ reddit LinkedIn StumbleUpon See How I Satisfied My Woman For Over 30 mins in Bed and Enlarge my penis size without Side Effect(Click Here To Read) Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus « Previous Article PDP Chairmanship Tussle: Conflicting Judgments Put Judiciary In The Spotlight Next Article » The Prolonged Leadership Capital Deficit In Nigeria Latest Posts 7:19 pm NVMA Appoints Godwin Abonyi New President — Comment 6:37 pm Ondo Guber: We Are Ready For Election – APC — Comment 6:29 pm Ondo Guber: Ekweremadu Hails Eyitayo’s Reinstatement — Comment 6:21 pm Akeredolu Accuses Oke Of Thugs Importation To Cause Violence — Comment 6:16 pm Dogara: Overlap Of Corruption Investigation Between EFCC, DSS Untidy — Comment 6:10 pm Appeal Court Verdict On Ondo Guber: Jimoh Ibrahim Heads To Supreme Court — Comment 6:01 pm Ondo Guber: Jubilation In Akure Over Jegede’s victory, As Kuku Denies Supporting Olusola Oke — Comment 5:50 pm Lagos Cancels Monthly Environmental Sanitation — Comment 5:42 pm N22.8b Fraud: Court Rules On Ex-Air Force Chief, Amosu, Others’ Application Thursday — Comment 5:39 pm Rivers Rerun: Wike Accuses Inec Of Handing Over Original Result Sheets To Amaechi — Comment Join Leadership Community Forum Poll Should The Federal Government Swap Detained Boko Haram Members For Chibok Girls?

As Eaton looks set to repeat London’s gold medal performance, here’s everything you need to know about his net worth, and endorsement deals. 1. His Net Worth Is Estimated at $500,000 (Getty) Several websites have pegged Eaton’s worth at an estimated $500,000. However, considering the lucrative endorsement deals he gained for the Rio Olympics, that figure is likely higher. He’s also received recent athletic recognitions, which adds value to his marketability. In December, Eaton won the Jesse Owens Award for U.S. Track and Field Male Athlete of the Year. He was also named World Male Athlete of the Year in November by the International Association of Athletics Federations. 2. He Earned a $750,000 Bonus for Setting a New World Record (Getty) Various sports governing bodies and other organizations offer financial incentives for athletic accomplishments. Eaton earned a $750,000 bonus for setting a new world record during the U.S. Track and Field trials before the London Games, according to E! News. At the 2012 Olympic Trials at the University of Oregon, Eaton finished first in seven of the 10 events to finish with 9,039 points— breaking Roman Sebrle’s 11-year World Record. On August 29, 2015, he beat his own world record with a score of 9,045 points at the 2015 World Championships. 3. He Has Earned Thousands from Major Competitions (Getty) American athletes winning medals at the Rio Olympic Games receive a cash prize from the U.S. Olympic Committee. The awards vary based on the medal won. Those awards are on top of the actual value of a “gold” medal – which is around $366 for the Rio games. The gold medal is a mixture of a small amount of 24-karat gold, some copper and a lot of sterling silver, according to Time. Eaton won $25,000 for his gold-medal finish at the 2012 Olympics Cash awards aren’t only at the Olympics— other international competitions also offer athletes the opportunity to rake in some dough. Eaton has competed in eight major international competitions, winning gold six times (2012 Olympics, 2013 and ’15 World Championships, 2012, ’14 and ’16 World Indoor Championships) and silver once (2011 World Championships). While the exact cash payouts for these competitions vary from year to year, the average for first place is $40,000 per event. According to the IAAF’s website, athletes received a $100,000 bonus for setting a world record per event at the 2015 World Championships. 4. He Has Endorsement Deals Including P&G, Gillette & Visa The road to Rio didn’t only include countless hours of training, it also involved business negotiations for Eaton and his agent. Prior to the summer games, Eaton signed with Gillette to endorse its razors. Sports Business Daily reported that the decathlete would also reprise his role in Procter & Gamble’s “Moms” campaign, which ran during the ’12 Games. “Obviously it’s the same family, so I deal with a lot of the same entities, and they have the same values. It’s also made things easy,” Eaton said of the agreement to Sports Business Daily. Eaton also has deals with Coca-Cola, Visa and Chobani. 5. Eaton is Hoping to Tell His Own Story Through His Business Partnerships Goodness in, Greatness out #NoBadStuff @Chobani pic.twitter.com/8GhTJsmdjI — Ashton Eaton (@AshtonJEaton) August 2, 2016 Eaton told the PostGame it’s important for him to shape his own brand as a professional athlete. He explained it’s something he takes into consideration before entering an endorsement deal. Eaton told the PostGame: You get approached by sponsors, and there’s just campaigns they want to run and the stories they want to tell, and you get a choice,” Eaton says. He’s explaining his new “Perfect Isn’t Pretty” campaign with Gillette, which shines a light on the hard work and suffering that happens behind-the-scenes, months and years before the Olympics arrive. [Myself and Gillette] are kind of looking to tell a parallel narrative. We both have goals, and the path to those goals isn’t always pretty, it’s rough. I think it’s what people should be seeing or hearing. Even if you see a great performance, it’s not always great getting there. There are injuries. … Intrinsically or unconsciously, people understand that — people see those performances and they know there are stories behind that. Another example is the deal he inked with Chobani earlier this year. As he told NBC, the tagline of Chobani’s #NoBadStuff campaign is what attracted Eaton to working with the company. “No bad stuff, it felt like something I have adopted as an athlete. Every day I am faced with some really frustrating situations,” he told NBC. “[And] they do not always get better. But I can choose whether to take those situations and see them as learning experiences.” Michael Phelps’ Net Worth: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know Michael Phelps is the most decorated Olympian of all time as he competes in his final games in Rio.

(Photo: The Enquirer/Meg Vogel)Buy Photo Cincinnati Bell has signed a 10-year deal worth $3.4 million to put its name on the Downtown and Over-the-Rhine streetcar, a major milestone for a project that has long been seeking support from the corporate community. The streetcar will be known as the "Cincinnati Bell Connector," and its colors and logo will be changed to fit the company's branding. Boarding stations also will be branded by Cincinnati Bell, whose logo features blue and green. Exact details of the new look will be released later, most likely before the streetcar's much-anticipated opening to the public on Sept. 9. "A lot of the yellow will be gone. People who don't like the Steelers' colors should be happy," said City Councilwoman Amy Murray, chair of Council's Transportation Committee, referring to the Pittsburgh-based rival of the Cincinnati Bengals. A majority of the naming rights space will be above the streetcar windows where the yellow -- actually a shade of orange -- currently is, she said. The naming rights deal, first reported Thursday evening on Cincinnati.com, is a significant step for the Greater Cincinnati corporate community, which had remained mostly silent since the streetcar idea was first floated nearly a decade ago. The region's major companies had been unwilling to support the streetcar, which has politically divided City Hall and the local Democratic Party. “The Cincinnati Bell Connector will play an important role in connecting residents, workers and visitors to their jobs and the tremendous entertainment opportunities from The Banks to Over-the-Rhine,” Cincinnati Bell CEO Ted Torbeck said in a statement. “Our mission at Cincinnati Bell is to connect people with what matters, whether it’s through our technology, or through projects like the Cincinnati Bell Connector that will enhance Cincinnati’s thriving urban core.” Cincinnati Bell has been embracing Downtown's renaissance in recent years. In 2014, the communications and technology company moved 600 employees from Norwood to a Downtown office tower at Fourth Street between Broadway and Main streets. Cincinnati Bell now has 1,100 employees based in Downtown. “We look forward to a long and productive partnership with Cincinnati Bell on the Cincinnati Bell Connector and thank them for their continued commitment to the city,” City Manager Harry Black said in a statement. The third party that sells the streetcar's advertising and naming rights, Advertising Vehicles, helped broker the Cincinnati Bell deal. For its troubles, it will receive 38 percent of the $3.4 million from the communications and technology company -- as per a 2015 contract between SORTA and Advertising Vehicles. That amounts to nearly $1.3 million. The deal nets $211,869 per year over the 10-year contract for the streetcar budget. That commitment by Cincinnati Bell could save taxpayers on operating costs, which have been a big concern for Mayor John Cranley and other critics of the streetcar. In February, streetcar officials told City Council they hoped naming rights could generate up to $6.5 million over 20 years. Bell's deal is an important step toward meeting those expectations. Many streetcar supporters have long been calling for Cincinnati corporations, including Procter & Gamble and Kroger, to support the 3.6-mile rail system. Supporters have promoted the streetcar as an economic development project, saying it could help the city draw new residents to the urban core and companies attract young workers. Nonetheless, it is rare for U.S. companies to buy naming rights to public transportation projects. According to Enquirer research, Cincinnati Bell is one of only two big corporations known to buy naming rights specifically for a streetcar project. In March, Quicken Loans agreed to pay $5 million over 10 years for naming rights of the Detroit streetcar. CINCINNATI.COM If city sells streetcar naming rights, stigma may keep buyers away How much marketing value might the move have? "I look at old-school companies like Cincinnati Bell, they have to go out and spend money to remind people why they matter and why they're valuable," said Drew Boyd, a marketing professor at the University of Cincinnati. "Putting your name on a transit line is probably not going to do that. It's more about general awareness. I'd rather them spend money to remind people why they matter and why they improve people's lives and make them more convenient or safe. Just putting your name on something doesn't do a lot. You have a have a message behind it as well." Anti-streetcar rhetoric has quelled significantly at City Hall in recent months as city officials believe they have a solid plan to cover the approximately $4 million annual operating cost. Cincinnati Bell's decision comes after several small businesses and restaurants have signed deals to advertise on the streetcar. The advertising space inside the streetcar vehicles is nearly sold out. Will Cincinnati Bell's decision prompt other corporations such as Procter & Gamble, Kroger and Macy's to jump on board the streetcar and buy advertising? Over-the-Rhine resident and streetcar advocate Derek Bauman believes it will. "This is an opportunity to reach millions of local eyeballs annually and be associated with a project that is a catalyst to the continuing renaissance of our city – and the most technologically advanced light rail vehicles in the world," he said. "Once you start seeing a few companies, that opens the way for other companies," said Councilwoman Murray, a former Procter & Gamble employee.

The Corporate Engagement Awards, hosted last night in London, recognises excellence in communication strategies for partnerships, sponsorships, and corporate social responsibility. Established in 2010, the Corporate Engagement Awards is a celebration of the indispensable talent companies and organisations have for effective communications in collaborations. Highlighting the exemplary work existing across the corporate engagement sphere, particularly in CSR, the sixth annual awards considered partnerships from organisations across a whole host of industries and insights. The ability of an organisation to excel in corporate engagement is a valuable asset to investors and consumers alike. With company engagement increasingly bound up within corporate trust values, creating and sustaining partnerships is beneficial to future company projections. The planning, execution and effectiveness of these strategic collaborations is what the Corporate Engagement Awards aims to recognise and celebrate. The ceremony was held at The Brewery, in Moorgate, Central London, and hosted by comedian and broadcaster Jon Holmes. A location befitting of the national status enjoyed by the Corporate Engagement Awards, The Brewery’s sophisticated atmosphere provided the perfect backdrop to a professional and enjoyable evening, celebrating the best in corporate collaborations and CSR. Andrew Thomas, publishing editor, Communicate magazine, says, “It’s delightful to see so many brands embracing collaboration, at an event dedicated to bringing people together. The Corporate Engagement Awards is dedicated to those companies and organisations which help people collaborate and work in partnerships to achieve a brighter future. There’s good in business, and tonight we are celebrating it.” Follow #CEAwards on Twitter to hear more from the Corporate Engagement Awards winners at The Brewery.

Schwabe Brooks McCabe Charlie Bowen John Brown Dolly Withrow Linda Arnold Government Law Energy SHOP About Us Job Openings Bank expects continued growth in Morgantown, WV area Posted: Thursday, July 28, 2016 9:05 AM EDT Updated: Saturday, August 27, 2016 9:05 AM EDT By Jim Ross West Virginia’s economy is growing on par with the national economy, but the northern and eastern parts are doing especially well, two Huntington Bank officials said last week. “The environment for business remains strong throughout 2016 despite all the headwinds we’ve had, and I would include West Virginia in that,” said Chad Prather, Huntington’s senior vice president and West Virginia commercial region manager. Prather said West Virginia has pockets of strong growth, such as the Eastern Panhandle, the Wheeling area, the North-Central part of the state and particularly the Morgantown area. In contrast, the Charleston and Huntington areas do not have robust growth, he said. Prater said the new Interstate 79 interchange and related infrastructure growth along with flat, developable land has fueled some growth in the Morgantown area, and he expects more to follow. Growth at and near West Virginia University is helping with small business growth as well, he said. The Northern Panhandle will benefit from the Shell ethane cracker to be built nearby in Pennsylvania, he said, and the new Procter & Gamble manufacturing facility near Martinsburg is adding to growth in the Eastern Panhandle, Prather said. “Small business thrives whenever economic activity is going on,” said George Mokrzan, senior economist at Huntington Bank. “This will be the year of the consumer, so any services that are tied to consumer spending should do very well.” In West Virginia, that should benefit the tourism industry in particular, he said. Mokrzan said West Virginia’s economic indicators are growing at about the same rate as those nationally. “It looks like a bottom has occurred,” he said. Prather and Mokrzan comment following the second-quarter earnings release of Huntington Bancshares, the parent company of Huntington Bank. In the quarter, Huntington Bancshares earned $175 million in the quarter, down $22 million from the same quarter last year. This story first appeared in the print edition of The State Journal.

(AP ... more Photo: Rebecca Blackwell Simone Biles' marketability window could be small there's always someone new 1 / 3 Back to Gallery RIO DE JANEIRO — In a hallway underneath the Rio Olympic Arena, a crush of journalists pushed against the metal fence in front of the world's best gymnast. Simone Biles, not even 5 feet tall, seemed to be swallowed up by the crowd. She fiddled with the green strap of her credential, but otherwise appeared at ease with another day as one of the most recognizable faces at the Summer Olympics. "We have an idea of just how big it is back home," the 19-year-old said. Biles won four gold medals, including the coveted all-around title, during an adjective-defying week where she made the sport's most difficult feats look routine. The performance cemented her place as perhaps the most gifted gymnast in history. She's so well known that she can't visit the Christ the Redeemer statue towering over Rio de Janeiro alone. More than a million people have followed her bubbly Instagram account this month. Limited-edition cereal boxes will celebrate her golden achievement. Translating that success into a long-term income stream promises to be difficult, because of a small window for most Olympians to capitalize on their notoriety. Biles could be an exception, particularly if she returns for the Tokyo Olympics in four years. "I wish it wasn't the case, but Olympians have a very short shelf life," said Matt Delzell, managing director of the The Marketing Arm in Dallas that specializes in sports and entertainment promotion. "We fall in love with these athletes who represent our country so well and then we forget about them. Then the next thing comes along." Biles carries a compelling backstory, adopted by her grandparents, Ron and Nellie, at age 5 during her birth mother's struggle with alcohol and drug addiction. Biles insists she's not a celebrity. But her showmanship has helped to turn her into one. When she winked at Shawn Johnson, the Olympic gold medalist in the balance beam in 2008, during a floor exercise weeks before the Games, video of the moment went viral. "I'm not the next Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps," she said after winning the all-around title last week. "I'm the first Simone Biles." The difference is Bolt and Phelps have shown the ability to transcend the four-year Olympic cycle. Fame for most Olympians comes and goes as quickly as the 17-day Games. Bolt, however, is the world's fastest human with wide-ranging international appeal, and Phelps, the swimmer who just completed his fifth Games and plans to retire, is the most decorated Olympian of all time. They don't just bring strong personalities and groundbreaking athletic success, they've done so at the Games over an extended period of time. Experts point to Gabby Douglas, who won all-around champion at the London Olympics, but didn't bring the same level of attention to Rio de Janeiro, as an example of the challenge gymnasts face to remain in the public eye when their careers are shorter than almost every other sport. "The limelight will die down. It's not as if gymnastics is a 24/7 sport," said Joe Favorito, a sports marketing expert who is a professor at Columbia University. "But (Biles) certainly has the ability between her background, her success and her personality to transcend the Games and make it beyond the four years." Added Delzell: "You're going to capitalize on the millions of eyeballs that are watching right now when she's the talk of the town, when she's the talk of the country." Biles got a head start. The three-time world champion turned professional last year — passing up the opportunity to compete for UCLA — and quickly amassed a wide-ranging portfolio of sponsorships. Months before her first gold medal, she was already treated like an Olympic champion. Sponsors lined up to capitalize on her success. She has her own line of gymnastics equipment and leotards. She endorsed a sports drink. She starred in advertisements for Procter & Gamble and Hershey's. She signed with Nike. Her face adorned a Kellogg's cereal box. Bob Dorfman, executive creative director for San Francisco-based Baker Street Advertising, sees more athlete-related marketing being taken care of in advance of the Games, rather than as a reaction to a flurry of gold medals. Biles has already taken the first step to make the success last. "You have to do something pretty special like she's done," Dorfman said. "A lot of this has to do with what kind of staying power she has." Experts estimate the pre-Olympics deals were worth between $2 million and $4 million, with the potential for $3 million or more in earnings in the coming year. That total could increase if Biles competes at the Tokyo Olympics. Though a new U.S. gymnastics star or two seems to emerge every four years, Daniel Rascher, a University of San Francisco sport management professor, thinks Biles might be an exception. Finding a way to maintain her level of exposure in non-Olympic years is key. "Simone is a superstar and has the ability to cut across a larger swath of the public's consciousness," he said. Next month, Biles, one of only six gymnasts ever to win four gold medals at the same Olympics, will join a group of gymnasts for a 36-city tour. Spectators can watch her signature move — named the "Biles" — a double layout with a half twist at the end during the floor exercise that no one else can do. It's enough to appear superhuman, though Martha Karolyi, the stern-faced coordinator for the U.S. women's national team, took pains to remind a group of journalists earlier this week that Biles is, in fact, human. Nastia Liukin, the all-around champion at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, understands better than most what's ahead for Biles. "The first few months, maybe the first year, she's going to struggle with having a normal life," said Liukin, who provided gymnastics commentary for NBC in Rio de Janeiro. "It's very exciting at first, but at some point you want to be able to go to a restaurant or get your nails done or go to the grocery or just be Nastia. I wanted to morph myself from being Nastia the Olympic champion to being me." And for Biles these days, being herself is enough. This is a TU+ story. Click for more information.

A farm in California practicing underground micro-irrigation to cope with the state's prolonged drought. The drought has cost the farmers and agricultural businesses some US$2.7 billion in revenue losses. Image: US Department of Agriculture, CC BY 2.0 By Asit Biswas and Cecilia Tortajada and Giovanna Chandler Thursday 18 August 2016 Share this story Two key events took place in in Singapore last month. First was the Water Leaders’ Summit within the context of the Singapore International Water Week, and the second was a CNBC discussion on Future of World’s Water: A Business Perspective. Both events explored in depth the role that business can play in managing global water resources. Senior officers from the world’s largest corporations and leading academic figures also discussed interlinkages between business and water. The global business community has faced substantial stress and challenges during the post-2000 period. Among these are investor demands for sustainable investments, resource scarcities, increasing scrutiny by media and social activists about malpractices, real or perceived, and continuing technological and management evolutions. These developments have heralded a new era for corporate sustainability reporting where businesses explain impacts of their operational practices on society, natural resources and environment. While sustainability reporting has mostly been voluntary, increasing scrutiny and pressure from non-governmental organisations (NGOs), media and governments, have encouraged the companies to assess and often publicly divulge the impacts, both positive and negative, of their activities on profitability and on society, natural resources and environment. In response to growing demand from investors, NGOs and media for broader and more comprehensive disclosure on environmental, social and governance (ESG) indicators for business operation, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the United States issued a guidance for publicly listed companies on key ESG issues. This guidance requires companies to take into account climate-related risks and uncertainties, physical availability of water as well as their quality considerations that could contribute to “decreased agricultural production capacity in areas affected by droughts or other weather-related changes”. The continuing California drought, and droughts in Australia, China and India, show that these events can directly affect the quality and levels of production, costs of doing business, and net profits. Under serious water scarcity conditions, a company’s licence to operate in an arid region may even be revoked, or significantly reduced. These are all material risks that investors should be aware of since they may affect the share prices of companies. Consider the current drought in California. This has cost the farmers and agricultural businesses some US$2.7 billion in revenue losses. Similarly, for a major developing country such as India, Indian President Pranab Mukherjee (and earlier finance minister) has aptly remarked that the monsoon is “the real finance minister of India” since it affects the economy in a myriad of ways. Availability of water thus has major economic impact on business and nations. “ Under serious water scarcity conditions, a company’s licence to operate in an arid region may even be revoked, or significantly reduced. For water, corporations need to ask three fundamental questions. First, is there enough reliable supply available, both in terms of quantity and quality, for their existing operations and future growth? Second, since water is always a local issue, will local authorities permit water withdrawals during prolonged drought years given their own water management practices are invariably poor and thus unlikely to meet increasing water needs? Third, is there a reputational risk for businesses even when water is available and companies have necessary permits to extract water during drought years? Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola had to close plants in India in 2004, even when they had authorisations to extract water. Savvy investors all over the world are now aware of the importance of water as a business risk, especially for food, beverage, clothing, textile, pulp, paper, energy and mining industries. Every industry needs water for operational purposes, but some industries need significant amounts of water, and are thus more vulnerable to water scarcity. The first major investor group to demand water information is the Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM). It now manages an US$862 billion portfolio of the Norwegian Government Pension Fund. It announced in August 2009 that it would start assessing the water risk management practices of 1,100 companies in which they held shares. Sustainability reports have been around for decades in one form or another. While such reports have gained momentum in the 21st century, their usefulness to investors and general public has been rather limited for many reasons.  Corporations in different industrial sectors use different production and manufacturing processes, and have different reasons for producing sustainability reports. In addition, large corporations often have operations in many countries across the world, and several facilities in each country. Thus, methodologically, it is difficult to determine their performance at a global level. Data used for one company, from one plant to another, may not be compatible. Equally, the data reliability often varies among locations. “ Savvy investors all over the world are now aware of the importance of water as a business risk, especially for food, beverage, clothing, textile, pulp, paper, energy and mining industries. No agreed global standard There is no agreed global standard and framework for sustainability reports. Three most prominent frameworks are Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), International Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB). Each has its own philosophy, approach and guidelines as to how sustainability should be defined, determined, assessed and reported. Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) started a new water risk disclosure assessment and reporting in 2009. CDP requests water-related information from companies. In its latest 2015 report, it noted only 38 per cent of companies responded to investors’ requests for disclosure on water-related data. While producing excellent reports, CDP faces some fundamental problems. Companies provide information, which is then analysed. In the current era where major companies deliberately provided erroneous information, there has to be ways to double check the veracity of information received. In addition, companies are interpreting identical questions differently. Finally, reporting activities of companies are often conducted by junior staff, sometimes even by interns, who lack overall understanding of the situations and exercise. CDP included eight companies in its “Water A List”. Based on our analysis, at least one of the companies in this list do not deserve to be there, and two of the world’s best companies in terms of managing water risk are not included. Importance of water for business Even before preparation of sustainability reports became mainstream, many corporations realised that reliable availability of water is a major risk. Take Nestle. It has taken active steps since the late 1990s to significantly improve its water use efficiencies and wastewater management practices. Between 2005 and 2013, it reduced direct water withdrawal for every product category by one-third. This also meant reduction of total water discharges from 145 to 91 million cubic metres, even though total production increased significantly. It is assisting farmers to produce products in an increasingly water-efficient manner. Procter & Gamble decided to reduce its water consumption by 20 per cent during 2010-2020. They achieved this target by 2015. Some 70 per cent of P&G products require water during their use. Through technological innovations, these products have become more water efficient and less polluting. For example, Downy fabric softeners enable consumers to rinse only once, instead of 3-4 times, saving 30-50 per cent of water in each washing. The company has now completely phased out phosphates globally from detergents, thus reducing the eutrophication potential of receiving water bodies. Coca-Cola has improved its water use efficiency by 25 per cent since 2005. It also has replenished 94 per cent of water used in finished beverages (153.6 billion litres) through 209 community projects in 61 countries. There is no question that the boardrooms of many major companies now realise that if they want to survive and thrive, they must change their corporate culture and mindset about the use of water. MNCs such as Nestle, Unilever, P&G and Coca-Cola have made remarkable advances since 2000 to significantly reduce their water footprints through new operational policies, process changes and making all their staff more water-sensitive. While the private sector is making rapid changes to improve their water management practices, corresponding advances by the public sector are conspicuous by their absence. If and when the public sector makes corresponding advances, the world’s water problems are likely to be significantly diminished.

Metal Magic provided all of the embossing dies. The tightly-registered foil accents, which lend authenticity to the piece, were achieved using state-of-the-art, in-line cold foiling technology. They also showcase the type of decorative effects that can cost-effectively elevate customers’ brands. Diamond won First Place in the “Sustainability – Folding Cartons” category for L’Oreal USA’s Matrix Oil Wonders promotional packaging. The carton was converted utilizing KapStone Kraftpak® high-yield, low density paperboard and printed with UV flexo white, opaque white, four color process, and dense black inks, in-line with UV varnish. Printed opaque white dots provide a perfect counterpoint to the brilliant gold foil stamped dots, creating dimension and visual interest. Gold foil surrounds the die cut windows, framing the hair care products within and drawing attention to the free product sample inside. The interplay between the unbleached paperboard and foil accents create shimmering metallic effects that are very unusual for a kraft-type folding carton. Diamond won Second Place in the “Sustainability – Folding Cartons” category for Gurwitch Products’ Laura Mercier Verbena Infusion folding carton. The carton was converted utilizing FSC-certified Invercote G paperboard and offset printed with two PMS green and black inks, in-line with UV matte coating. Printing on the reverse side of the board contributes to the product's natural aesthetic, while the subtle foil stamping and embossing accents on the front, side, and top panels infuses the visual with a rich, exotic quality. All of Diamond’s winning entries were manufactured using 100% clean, renewable wind energy and produced in a Zero Manufacturing Waste to Landfill (ZMWL) facility.

Subscribe for $59/Yr - Save $50 AT&T Consolidates Massive Account With Omnicom WPP's Grey Losing DirecTV Creative and MEC Losing Media By Maureen Morrison. Published on August 12, 2016. AT&T's 'Close to Home' Credit: AT&T Most Popular AT&T has consolidated its creative, digital and media accounts with Omnicom after a relatively swift holding-company level review that began in June. Omnicom will be responsible for the vast majority of AT&T's creative, media, digital, data and analytics in the U.S., though a spokesman said the scope includes Mexico. BBDO will take the lead on creative, which includes brand work for AT&T and DirecTV; Hearts & Science, a recently launched media agency, will be the carrier's new media agency. "We have selected Omnicom via its BBDO and Hearts & Science units to be AT&T's integrated creative and media agency," said Lori Lee, senior executive VP and global marketing officer at AT&T, in a statement. Ms. Lee was named to that role in 2015. "Omnicom has brought together one dedicated team representing the best talent across Omnicom to work seamlessly with us to position AT&T as the world's premier integrated communications company. A single integrated team allows us to move quickly, innovate at scale and take a data-driven, holistic approach to reaching consumers and businesses." In the statement, Ms. Lee also said that Omnicom's "capabilities are important as we get ready to launch new streaming video entertainment choices that are built for mobile." When AT&T launched the review in June, the company said that it was looking for "efficiencies, quality and consistency across the portfolio." Because it had been working with Omnicom's BBDO on creative for the AT&T brand, and WPP's Grey for DirecTV and MEC for Media, the nation's second-largest advertiser only invited those two holding companies to pitch for the business. MediaLink oversaw the process. Ms. Lee said in the statement today that "we believe this integrated, best-in-class approach is the future for brands wanting breakthrough marketing innovation, quality and efficiency at scale." Not affected by the review was multicultural creative, which is handled by multiple agencies. Cricket, AT&T's smaller wireless brand, will remain at Argonaut for creative work, but media buying, previously handled by MEC, will move to Hearts & Science. BBDO and MEC have been working with AT&T since 2007. Grey had been handling DirecTV since 2010. MEC's mobile carrier experience extends overseas, where it won the international Vodafone account in 2014. At the time, AT&T was rumored to be eyeing a Vodafone acquisition. "Like Omnicom, WPP is a world-class group and we appreciate their hard work and nine-year partnership," said Ms. Lee in the statement. In a statement, Omnicom said "we are extremely pleased to have won the business and look forward to continue working with AT&T." A WPP spokesman said simply: "We are very disappointed." Grey, in a separate statement, said: "We have had a fantastic run on DirecTV and have been privileged to help grow that brand with years of award-winning campaigns that struck a chord in pop culture. We wish AT&T and their agency partners continued success."

The campaign branched out to include sports stars. MEC released a statement saying: "We are of course extremely disappointed with this outcome. We had a strong and tenured relationship with AT&T, a rarity in this day and age. From winning the first ever Cannes Media Lion, the immense amount of talent driving forward so many award-winning industry-first innovations across digital and data, leaves us proud of the work we have delivered over the years together. We wish AT&T the best of luck in their future direction." AT&T has a lengthy roster of agencies, and while the fate of each individual agency was not immediately known, the spokesman said "we'll continue to use some independent agencies where needed." A couple Publicis agencies, such as Razorfish and Sapient have also been on the roster, though their fate was immediately unclear. The result is a big blow to WPP, although MEC earlier this month won the media account for Hertz in North America to act as the lead agency across the company's agency partners. For Omnicom, the win not only lets BBDO keep its AT&T work, but brings in the DirecTV creative that had been at Grey. It's also a big coup for Hearts & Science, which officially launched earlier this year to house the Procter & Gamble media work, which Omnicom won the bulk of in December 2015. The review is one of the largest to occur in years. Only Procter & Gamble spends more than AT&T in the U.S. In 2015, the carrier spent a total of $3.87 billion on both measured and unmeasured media, according to data analyzed by Ad Age's DataCenter. Prior to the review and after AT&T acquired DirecTV in July 2015, the company had been holding a series of jump balls for project work, which often resulted in BBDO and Grey pitching against one another to create campaigns for projects. WPP couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
