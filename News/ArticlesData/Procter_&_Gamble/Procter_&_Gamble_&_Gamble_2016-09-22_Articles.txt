Reprints Reprints Arthur Sadoun. Credit: Courtesy Publicis In its continuing effort to bust silos, Publicis Communications is creating a single P&L in each country for all its creative agencies, and the U.S. is next. To handle that responsibility for North America, Andrew Bruce and Kurt Ritter will be named CEO and chairman, respectively, of Publicis Communications North America at today's global meeting of 140 Publicis execs from around the world, led by Arthur Sadoun, CEO of Publicis Communications. Both will retain their current roles; Mr. Bruce is president-CEO of Publicis Worldwide's North America region and Mr. Ritter, a former longtime General Motors exec who joined Saatchi in 2003, is chairman-CEO of Saatchi & Saatchi Los Angeles and Team One, and chairman of Canada. "The P&L will be at the country level rather than the brand level," Mr. Sadoun told Ad Age. "I have no doubt this is the future." Kate Stanners Credit: Courtesy of Saatchi & Saatchi Mr. Sadoun is also announcing at today's meeting in New York the elevation of three execs – all women – at the network level. At Saatchi & Saatchi, London-based Kate Stanners, who was promoted to global chief creative officer in April, adds the title of global chairwoman. Ms. Stanners steps into the position held by Kevin Roberts until his abrupt exit in June following his controversial comments about gender diversity in an interview.

At Publicis Worldwide, Valerie Henaff, CEO of Publicis Conseil, one of France's two biggest creative shops and the network's flagship agency, will add the new title of global president. After the Kevin Roberts debacle, Publicis Groupe execs want to make it clear that advocating for gender equality starts at the top, and the promotion of three senior women at the three creative networks reflects the diversity in their ranks. "Our board is run by a woman [Publicis Groupe's Supervisory Board Chair Elisabeth Badinter]," Mr. Sadoun said. "Our two biggest offices, Paris and New York, are run by women. Our commitment to equality is very strong. I prefer to be judged on this subject that's very important for us more on what we do and not what we say." In other moves, Carla Serrano and Bill Kanarick will be promoted to co-chief strategy officers of Publicis Communications. Ms. Serrano became CEO of Publicis Worldwide's New York office in January and Mr. Kanarick is chief strategy officer of Publicis.Sapient, roles they will both keep. Publicis Communications was formed on Jan. 2, 2016, as part of a major reorganization of parent Publicis Groupe; it comprises the agency company's creative networks and is run by Mr. Sadoun. On the P&L front, Mr. Sadoun said Publicis Communications has already made the move to a country-based P&L from a brand-based P&L in more than 60% of its markets, accounting for about 40% of total revenue and helping to foster collaboration and remove barriers to total integration. Adding its two biggest markets, North America and France, to be announced today, will help bring that up to 80% of the world. Mr. Sadoun, who likes to talk about helping clients achieve transformation by using "the alchemy of creativity and technology" – and who also favors long internal emails – said in the most recent one that "we are completely moving away from brand P&Ls to country P&Ls." With the January reorganization, Publicis Groupe set up global client leaders and allowed each global client their own P&L, organization and structure. Mr. Sadoun noted the global client P&L is an internal measure at the holding company level, while Publicis Communications' move to single country P&Ls reflects how the creative agency division will be managed. He said both are "totally revolutionary" in achieving integration. Separately, Publicis Chairman-CEO Maurice Levy told the audience at a Goldman Sachs media conference this week in New York that Publicis Groupe's board will start deliberating on the much-awaited decision about the identity of his successor in November, and make an announcement by February. He is scheduled to retire in May 2017, and Mr. Sadoun is considered his likely successor, perhaps with Mr. Levy continuing to play a role. Mr. Levy returned to Paris before today's Publicis meeting. Mr. Sadoun declined to comment on succession.

Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Sep 23, 2016 at 4:17PM Image source: Getty Images. For income investors, there's a certain Goldilocks quality to judging a dividend payout ratio. If the number is too small, say 10%, it implies that the company doesn't prioritize returning cash to shareholders through steadily increasing payouts. But a ratio that's too high isn't good either, since it points to slow growth -- or even a dividend cut -- in the future. The challenge, then, is often in finding that "just right" middle ground. What is a dividend payout ratio? The dividend payout ratio is the percentage of a company's earnings that it delivered to shareholders in dividends, typically over the prior 12 months. It's calculated by dividing dividends paid by net income and then multiplying that result by 100. You can perform this calculation either by using per-share figures or by sticking to total earnings and dividends. For example, if a company earned $1 per share of profit in the last year and paid out $0.50 per share in dividends, its payout ratio would be $0.50 / $1 * 100 = 50%. Likewise, if net income was $10 billion and dividends were $5 billion, the formula would be $5 billion / $10 billion * 100 = 50%. A strong but not too high dividend payout ratio is typically in the range of between one half and three-quarters of earnings. Problems with the dividend payout ratio The payout ratio is limited in what it can tell you about the strength of a dividend, though. For one thing, it keys off of earnings, which don't always capture a company's true operating situation. If a retailer is restructuring its business and taking writedowns for layoffs and store closings, for example, net income can sink in a given year, which would elevate the payout ratio. That's why it's helpful to look at a company's cash flow to judge whether the dividend is really in danger of being sliced. With that caveat in mind, here are the biggest payout ratios on the Dow today. Highest dividend payout ratios Stock Payout Ratio Caterpillar 197% ExxonMobil 117% Pfizer 100% Coca-Cola 78% Procter & Gamble 76% Source: Yahoo! Finance. Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) and ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) top this list due to sharp profit declines over the last few years as commodity prices dove. Yet while earnings are sinking, these companies managed to produce enough cash flow to comfortably cover their payouts. Caterpillar's operating cash was $2.8 billion over the last six months, or about three times its dividend payout. Exxon's $6 billion of dividends over the same time represented less than two-thirds of operating cash. Both companies have assured investors that they intend to maintain and even grow their dividends in the face of major industry downturns. Pfizer's dividend is in a much stronger position than its 100% payout ratio would suggest. Last year's earnings were pinched by foreign currency swings, costly acquisitions, and restructuring charges that aren't set to repeat in 2017. Its steady cash flow has in fact funded the return of nearly $9 billion to shareholders over the last six months. A fairly recent dividend cut, though, suggest there are better dividends among Pfizer's rivals.   Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) are facing serious business challenges as well, but they have suffered less dramatic profit swings thanks to their consumer-focused portfolios. The soda giant's sales volume growth has been unusually slow for years, and the same goes for P&G's organic sales gains. Yet both companies have demonstrated a willingness and ability to boost their cash returns to shareholders. In Coke's case, that includes a fund-raising initiative to sell off portions of its bottling network. For P&G, it involves parting with some of its biggest brands, like Duracell batteries and Coty beauty products, so that the remaining business can be stronger and more profitable. None of these elevated payout ratios portends a dividend cut, mainly thanks to healthy cash flow trends. That's why income investors who can stomach the volatility that comes with a cyclical business like Caterpillar's might find its nearly 4% dividend yield enticing. For a clearer profit growth outlook and a high -- but sustainable -- payout, consider investing in Coca-Cola. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Dan Caplinger (TMFGalagan) Sep 23, 2016 at 11:31AM Dividend investors regard tobacco giant Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) as a strong prospect, known for a favorable dividend policy that treats its investors much better than how most other stocks pay their shareholders. Yet many investors underestimate just how important dividends are to the value proposition Philip Morris stock offers, and it's easy not to understand the full magnitude of the company's payments of its income to shareholders. Let's take a closer look at three things you need to know about Philip Morris and its dividend. 1. Philip Morris is a dividend payment leader. Philip Morris is a large company, but it's far from the largest in the stock market. With a market capitalization of less than $160 billion, there are plenty of other stocks that are valued more highly. Yet Philip Morris still ranks among the leaders of the entire stock market when it comes to how much money it returns to shareholders in dividends. The consumer staples sector of the S&P 500 as a whole has been a dividend stalwart for the overall market, ranking second only behind technology and paying out $14.3 billion in dividends during the second quarter. By itself, Philip Morris was responsible for more than 10% of the sector's total, paying $1.59 billion in common dividends during the quarter. That ranked only behind Procter & Gamble in terms of total cash dividend paid within consumer staples, a company with half again Philip Morris' market capitalization. 2. Philip Morris' dividend yield stands above its peers. Philip Morris currently has a dividend yield of 4.1%. Although you can find plenty of stocks with higher dividends, what's rare is to find companies that are able to match Philip Morris' yield after becoming leaders in their respective industries and attaining megacap status. Within the S&P 500, there are currently only three other stocks with market capitalizations of more than $100 billion that have higher yields than Philip Morris. They include telecom giants AT&T and Verizon, which have always had a history of making utility-like dividend payments to their shareholders out of the massive cash flow their respective telecom networks generate. In addition, Chevron currently has a higher yield, reflecting in part the more than 20% drop in its stock price since its 2014 highs in the aftermath of the plunge in crude oil prices. 3. Philip Morris has a perfect record of dividend growth. Philip Morris has been an independent company for nearly nine years now, and in each of those nine years, it has made dividend increases. The tobacco giant has repeatedly stated its commitment to supporting a dividend policy that not only rewards shareholders with quarterly payouts but also boosts the size of those payouts over time. That policy hasn't come without challenges. Currency-related headwinds have plagued Philip Morris' earnings for a couple of years now, and that has brought growth to the company's revenue and net income to a near-standstill at times. Philip Morris has responded by reducing the size of its dividend hikes, but it nevertheless hasn't stopped making at least small increases over the past couple of years. When conditions in the foreign exchange market reach a new equilibrium, Philip Morris investors hope that dividend growth will accelerate. Philip Morris is a dividend powerhouse, and there are many ways in which the company stands out from the crowd for income investors. The three aspects discussed above make it clear that Philip Morris can be a valuable component of a dividend stock portfolio for those who want regular, reliable income from their holdings.

The Imagine Entertainment co-founder was among a handful of TV producers and studios this week making outreach to clients of Omnicom Group, the large advertising-agency holding company. Each year, the company’s media-buying operations, which includes agencies like OMD, PHD and Hearts & Science holds a showcase known as a “Final Front,” which brings together media outlets seeking to strike deals with the company’s blue-chip clients, which these days include Procter & Gamble, McDonalds, State Farm and Apple. In the past, the assemblage has focused largely on weaving advertisers into new content ideas, but this year, the emphasis is shifting, said Claudia Cahill, chief content officer of Omnicom Media Group, in an interview (pictured, above). Marketers see video being distributed acorss mobile screens and want to incorporate that into the plans they concoct with TV programs, she said. “Content is being created everywhere and our partenrs are much more open and willing to customize,” she said. Related Who Wants To Buy An Ad In Mark Burnett’s New Digital-Media Treasure Hunt? Grazer’s pitch serves as an interesting example of the ideas that were bandied about at the meetings, which included presentations from media outlets including NBCUniversal, Viacom, Vice, CW, Conde Nast, BuzFeed, AwesomenessTV, PopSugar, Upworthy and LiveNation. The producer offered a look at “Chasing Genius,” a companion to a new scripted series called “Genius” that is being readied for debut on National Geographic Channel. The main series profiles innovators like Albert Einstein. But “Chasing Genius” looks at teams using crowdsourcing to gain insights to solve global challenges. FX put a spotlight on a companion series to the networks’ longrunning comedy, “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia.” Dubbed “Project Bad Ass,” the new project offers to bring an advertiser into a virtual-reality series aimed at fans of “Sunny.” Viewers get to “join” the character “Mac” from “Sunny” as he set out on various – and often ill-fated – extreme sports stunts. Producers see an “unprecedented opportunity for brands to become part of the action and engage with consumers in a cutting-edge and exciting new medium,” said Eric Schrier, president of original programming, FX Networks and FX Productions, in a statement. Then idea of the “Final Front” is to give Omnicom clients first crack at developing interesting content alliances before others might get word of them. Getting early notice of such availabilities has become more important on Madison Avenue, where many advertisers are trying to build new ways to support programs that aren’t as distracting as the typical 30-second TV ad, which tends to interrupt an audience increasingly able to turn to other content thanks to new technology.

However, our audiences are no longer a given. Publishers and advertisers need to meticulously tailor their content to survive in a cutthroat media landscape. Disruption in our industry is the norm The Internet is maturing and evolving at an unprecedented speed. Disruption is the norm and advertisers need to react with agility and intuition. While traditional online display advertising still makes a profit, rising challenges such as banner blindness among readers are limiting its effectiveness. Native advertising, content marketing and/or remarketing are climbing the ranks as real options to make money from a publishers’s digital audience. The emergence of ad blocking A key issue on the global digital advertising agenda is ad blocking. While ad blocking is still in it’s infancy and relatively low in South Africa, it does hold the potential to impact the ability for advertisers to achieve the laser point 'holy grail' of ‘right message, right person, right time’ and of course, more recently, ‘right device.’ This has a bearing on actual acquisition costs and efficiency. As marketing is driven by cost per acquisition, ad blocking limits audience reach, regardless of what platform they are using. A united front to counter ad blocking As a global organisation, the IAB is spearheading the digital advertising industry’s reaction to this phenomenon. On September 15 2016, the Coalition for Better Ads was announced in Cologne, Germany, at the Dmexco conference. In addition to the IAB, founding members include heavyweights such as Google, Facebook, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, the 4As, the Association of National Advertisers, the World Federation of Advertisers, The Washington Post and GroupM. Using technology currently being developed at the IAB's Tech Lab, the consortium aims to monitor digital ad campaigns, scoring them on everything from creative to load time. Standards will be set using data gleaned from the system as well as from consumer feedback and input from marketers. As IAB CEO Randall Rothenberg says, it is critical that, as an industry, we create standards that ensure that consumers get safe, fast, secure delivery of the sites and services they love. So far, ad blocking has been less of a challenge in our ‘mobile-first’ context. That does not mean that SA publishers do not need to prepare for ad blocking as they grow their digital presence and audiences. Rather, the idea that global audiences feel led to block out irrelevant advertising should shape what we choose to publish, and how we engage with readers that are becoming increasingly discerning. Ultimately, it’s about great content The Internet cannot survive without content. In South Africa, we have reached a crossroads rich in opportunity. While our oldest print and press partners are experiencing challenges, our digital industry is hungry for excellent content. We cannot afford to lose good journalists with years of experience because one segment of the media is struggling. As the IAB SA, we are committed to finding ways to supporting our various member sectors to integrate journalists that can no longer work in the print environment, finding them a place within the digital ecosystem. We aim to turn the disruption within print into dialogue. This speaks to the digital publishing industry’s need to deliver relevant content to their audiences in a seamless manner. This content is created by skilled teams that need to be paid competitive salaries. Therefore, digital advertising needs to evolve in such a way that online teams are able to monetise their business and keep creating great content. It’s also about getting to know your users We recommend publishers and brands engage more intimately with their users to establish want they will and won’t accept to remain loyal readers and customers. Open up a dialogue with users so they can contribute to the boundaries of their experience of the platform and what will serve them best. Enhance their experience by making it seamless and laser pointed in its relevance to the individual. Humans are more than a set of data points, possessing their own idiosyncrasies and preferences. They are consumers of content, but also consumers of relevant products and services. The right advert addresses an individual need. In this sense, digital advertising should be a welcome diversion and not a rude interruption. If we strike this balance, publishers and ultimately their advertisers will retain, or in some cases win back, the trust of their audiences.

Profit taking may weigh on the markets, as traders cash in on the recent gains. Trading activity may be somewhat subdued, however, with a lack of major U.S. economic data keeping some traders on the sidelines. U.S. stocks advanced for the third straight session on Thursday amid the release of some domestic economic data, an extension of the commodity rally and a lingering positive reaction to Wednesday's Fed decision. The major averages opened higher and moved roughly sideways in a broad range. Although there was a loss of momentum in late afternoon trading, renewed buying lifted the averages yet again, leading to a positive close. The Dow Industrials added 98.76 points or 0.54 percent before ending at 18,393, the S&P 500 Index closed 14.06 points or 0.65 percent higher at 2,177 and the Nasdaq Composite closed at a new record closing high of 5,340, up 44.34 points or 0.84 percent. Twenty-eight of the thirty Dow components ended the session higher, while only two stocks declined. Procter & Gamble (PG), Disney (DIS), United Technologies (UTX), Coca-Cola (KO), Boeing (BA), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Apple (AAPL) and Verizon (VZ) were among the biggest gainers of the session. Among the sectors, housing and oil service stocks advanced notably, but gold stocks gave back some ground. On the economic front, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims fell to 252,000 in the week ended September 17th from 260,000 in the previous week. Economists had expected an uptick in claims to 262,000. The four-week average fell to 258,500 from 260,750. Continuing claims calculated with a week's lag were down 36,000 to 2.113 million. A report released by the National Association of Realtors showed that existing home sales came in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.33 million units in August, down from the downwardly revised 5.38 million-unit rate for July. Economists expected sales to have come in at a 5.44 million unit-rate compared to the 5.39 million-unit rate initially reported for July. Single-family home sales fell 2.3 percent, but condominium sales jumped 10.5 percent. Existing home inventories measured in absolute terms fell to 2.04 million units from 2.11 million units, with the months of supply at 4.6 months. The median price of an existing home fell 1.3 percent month-over-month to $240,200, rendering the annual rate to 5.1 percent. The Federal Housing Finance Agency said its house price index climbed a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent month-over-month in July, ahead of the 0.4 percent growth expected by economists. The annual rate of growth accelerated to 5.8 percent from a revised 5.7 percent. The Conference Board reported that its leading economic indicators fell 0.2 percent month-over-month in August, while economists expected a 0.1 percent increase. The July growth was upwardly revised to 0.5 percent from 0.4 percent. Six of the 10 components making up the index served as drags, while the interest rate spread continued to positively influence the index. The Chicago Federal Reserve's national activity index unexpectedly fell to -0.55 in August from 0.24 in July, suggesting a contraction in activity. Meanwhile, the Kansas City Federal Reserve's regional manufacturing index improved to 6 in September from -4 in August. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures for November delivery are slipping $0.11 to $46.21 barrel after climbing $0.98 to $46.32 a barrel on Thursday, marking the fourth straight session of gains that lifted futures to the highest level since September 8th. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,343.80 an ounce, down $0.90 from the previous session's close of $1,344.70 an ounce. On Thursday, gold rallied $13.30. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 100.79 yen compared to the 100.76 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1220 compared to yesterday's $1.1208. Asia The major Asian markets went about in a lackluster manner before ending mixed as the central-bank induced din died down. The Japanese, Chinese, Shanghai, Hang Seng and Indian markets ended lower, while the rest of the markets posted gains. With the yen remaining close to its recent lows, the Japanese market experienced some profit taking, as it re-opened after yesterday's public holiday. The Nikkei 225 Index languished below the unchanged line throughout the session before ending down 53.60 points or 0.32 percent at 16,754. Retail, export, financial, real estate, telecom and chemical stocks moved to the downside. However, housing, refining, utility and pharma stocks ended mostly higher. Food stocks saw mixed sentiment. Australia's All Ordinaries Index rose steadily after showing tentativeness in early trading. The index closed 52.30 points or 0.96 percent higher at a 3-week high of 5,519, rising for the fourth straight session. The market witnessed an across-the-board rally, with telecom, real estate and healthcare stocks among the standout performers. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended at 23,687, down 73.32 points or 0.31 percent, and China's Shanghai Composite Index closed 8.42 points or 0.28 percent lower at 3,034. On the economic front, provisional results released by Markit showed that the Japanese manufacturing sector returned to expansion, with a PMI score of 49.2 in September compared to 49.5 in August. Meanwhile, all industry activity grew at a slower pace in July, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said. The all industry activity index rose 0.3 percent month-over-month in July following June's 1 percent increase. Nonetheless, this was the second consecutive increase in activity and better than the expected 0.2 percent growth. Europe European stocks are seeing weakness on profit taking after gains in recent sessions, with oil's weakness and weak private sector activity data weighing on stocks. On the economic front, the eurozone private sector grew at the slowest pace in 20 months in September, flash data from Markit showed. The flash composite output index slid to 52.6 in September from 52.9 in August. Economists had expected the reading to fall marginally to 52.8. The factory PMI improved to 52.6 from 51.7 in August, while it was expected to fall to 51.5. Meanwhile, the services PMI dropped to 52.1 from 52.8 in the prior month. This was the lowest in 21 months. The index was forecast to remain unchanged at 52.8. French statistical office INSEE downwardly revised its second quarter GDP estimate for France to show a 0.1% drop following a 0.7 percent increase in the first quarter. The preliminary estimate showed no growth for the second quarter. U.S. Economic Reports Markit is set to release its flash U.S. manufacturing PMI for September at 9:45 am ET. Economists expect the index to edge down to 52 from 52.1 in August. Philadelphia's Patrick Harker will deliver prepared remarks about the role of Fed in the community in Philadelphia at 12 pm ET.

Stocks in Focus Athletic footwear and apparel retailer Finish Line (FINL) is moving higher in pre-market trading after reporting second quarter earnings that met analyst estimates on better than expected sales. Novatel Wireless (MIFI) may also see early strength after announcing an agreement to sell its mobile broadband business to Hong Kong-based T.C.L. Industries Holdings for $50 million. Meanwhile, shares of Facebook (FB) may move to the downside after a report from the Wall Street Journal said the social media giant overestimated average viewing time for its video ads for two years. AAR Corp. (AIR) reported better than expected first quarter adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations and revenues. Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) said it is pricing its underwritten public offering of 5.02 million shares at $59.75 per share, below Thursday's closing price of $60.97. by RTT Staff Writer For comments and feedback: editorial@rttnews.com Top Ten Corporate Comeback Stories The Most Influential Books In Business Fed Chatterbox: Economic Preview Week of November 14 Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Follow RTT Editor's Pick Most Read Most Emailed Volkswagen To Cut 23,000 Jobs In Germany Cyber Monday Sales Seen Soaring LinkedIn Is Now Blocked In Russia Facebook Stops WhatsApp Data Sharing Across Europe Over EU Criticism Wal-Mart Q3 Profit Declines, But Lifts FY17 Profit View; Stock Down JPMorgan Nears Over $250 Mln Settlement Over China Hiring Probe: Reports Comeback Kid: Donald Trump Hugely Resilient In Business, Too Target Lifts Q4, FY16 Forecast As Q3 Results Top Estimates Snapchat Parent Confidentially Initiates IPO Process Amazon Switching From Wrapping Paper To Reusable Bags Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances Home Depot Lifts FY EPS View In Line With Market As Q3 Results Top Estimates United Airlines Announces Plans For Long-term Earnings Growth FDA Snubs DVAX, Keep An Eye On OCUL, It's All Green For BLUE Home Depot Black Friday Deals Heavy On Appliances AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Crew Members Hurt As Canadian Plane Swerves To Avoid Possible Drone LinkedIn Is Now Blocked In Russia AAA: Low Gas Prices Drive Spike In Thanksgiving Travel Upgrade: Steel Stocks In For Trump Renaissance All Is Well With ACRS, First Avastin Biosimilar In The Works, CLRB Abuzz Nokia Sets Financial & Strategic Targets; Remains Focused On Cost Saving Program Vonovia Offers 0.496645 Shares/conwert Shr Or Alternative Cash Of EUR 16.16/shr United Airlines Restricts Economy To One Small Carry-on Novartis Reportedly Considering Sale Of Alcon Eye Care Division Samsung To Buy Harman Intl' In About $8 Bln All-cash Deal Kenneth Cole Closing Brick-and-Mortars United Airlines Announces Plans For Long-term Earnings Growth Target Lifts Q4, FY16 Forecast As Q3 Results Top Estimates AMGN Crosses BRIDGE, Anxiety Over PTCT's Translarna Eases, EGRX Opens Wallet AT&T Stream Saver To Limit Video Quality To 480p Genentech: Actemra Meets Endpoints In Phase III GiACTA Study Digi Rejects $13.82/shr Proposal From Belden - Quick Facts Schnuck Markets Recalls Ready-to-eat Grilled Chicken Products Kidde Recalls 3.6 Mln Combination Smoke And Carbon Monoxide Detectors Copyright © 2016 RTTNews.

Reprints Reprints 'Dateline' has examined the Steven Avery case both before and since the Netflix series 'Making a Murderer.' Credit: Courtesy NBC Most Popular Decades before "Serial" and "Making a Murderer" made true crime a phenomenon in new media, and before "The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story" won more Emmys than "Game of Thrones," "Dateline" was telling the stories of little-known crimes taking place in small towns in Kansas or rural Ohio week in and week out. The NBC series began its 25th season on Friday, joining a vanishingly small group of TV series to last so long. Other members of the club include "60 Minutes," "The Simpsons," "Survivor" and not many more. But "Dateline" also starts its latest run in a unique position, both buoyed and crowded by the surging interest in true crime. Newcomers are generating greater buzz on stories similar or identical to those that "Dateline" regularly covers by elevating them to the stature of critically acclaimed dramas. Then there are the downdrafts on traditional TV generated as viewers migrate to rivals like Netflix, drawn by programming such as "Making a Murderer." "'Dateline' doesn't get the credit, but if you went back and looked at the audience for when it started doing true crime, it was likely a way bigger audience than what any of these others have done," said Robert Thompson, TV and pop culture professor at Syracuse University. If you give "Dateline" its proper due, you notice that it was one of the first to throw a spotlight on the Steven Avery case at the heart of "Making a Murderer." It also extensively covered the O.J. Simpson trial that has recently recaptured the nation. The show "preceded, and you can argue was an instigator of, the true crime conversation," said "Dateline" senior executive producer David Corvo. Now "Dateline" is looking to keep up with the burgeoning competition by experimenting with a six- or eight-part series of its own delving into one long-running case. It's also giving its own takes on stories that have become part of the cultural zeitgeist. A one-hour special on the Steven Avery case including a rare 2005 interview with Penny Beerntsen, the victim in the sexual assault case for which Mr. Avery was wrongfully convicted, was watched by 5 million viewers on the night it aired in January and 2.1 million in the key 25-to-54 demographic. It added another 1.2 million viewers in DVR and on-demand viewing in the three days after it premiered. A two-hour special on the O.J. Simpson case featuring an interview with lead prosecutor Marcia Clark averaged 6 million total viewers and 2.4 million in the 25-to-54 demo. Its take on the JonBenét Ramsey murder, another story that has been thrown back into the spotlight in recent weeks, was watched by 6.5 million people earlier in the month. And the show will be doing 15 consecutive two-hour specials to commemorate its anniversary. But even as Mr. Corvo watches others find success in a genre that "Dateline" helped build, he said he doesn't feel the need to drastically alter a strategy that has accumulated a loyal audience over the show's life. In its heyday, "Dateline" often ranked within the 10 most-watched TV programs of the week. Today it isn't a hit in the traditional sense, but pulls an impressive audience for what's typically considered a dead zone for TV, averaging about 4.8 million viewers on any given Friday in its latest season and 1.7 million 25-to-54-year-olds. (The show also airs a Sunday edition that does not regularly cover true crime.) It has a stable roster of advertisers such as Procter & Gamble, Pfizer and Chrysler. While it surely isn't on any marketer's must-buy list, it is an efficient TV play that delivers consistent, loyal audiences."Dateline" also boasts celebrity fans like Taylor Swift, who admitted in a 2016 Vogue article that "Dateline" is her favorite show. Kim Kardashian told Harper's Bazaar in 2015 that she loves watching "Dateline," and Demi Lovato discussed her obsession with the show during an interview with Jimmy Fallon. "It is important for us to not lose our way," Mr. Corvo said. "The stories in little towns about people who are not famous and crimes that are not widely known that touch upon faith, family, betrayal—we don't want to lose sight of those." While some of those may end up becoming the Steven Avery stories down the road, for "Dateline" the focus is on "maintaining a relentless hum," Mr. Corvo said. "It is a marathon, not a sprint, and once in a while you need to pick up the pace to catch up." Unsolved mysteries "It is a very different business to be on the air two times a week and produce 100 hours of programming," he added. "These other programs, it's a few hours of content and they have tremendous time to do them and a ton of marketing." Even as the true crime space becomes increasingly crowded, there are no plans to pivot away from unsolved cases, wrongful convictions and surprising culprits. But Mr. Corvo said the show's creators are always looking at opportunities to take the franchise in new directions. Last year, "Dateline" aired "On Assignment," a limited series anchored by Lester Holt and featuring pieces from NBC News. "Dateline" has come a long way from its first season, when former producers and NBC News executives came under fire for staging a car explosion for a segment on the dangers of a General Motors truck. But "Dateline" not only survived, it thrived. At its peak, the show aired five nights per week. Stars including Katie Couric, Bryant Gumbel and Ann Curry passed through its doors. 'Dateline' anchors Dennis Murphy, Andrea Canning, Lester Holt, Keith Morrison and Josh Mankiewicz. Credit: Courtesy NBC In those early days, "Dateline" aired some segments on unsolved cases and other mysteries, but the focus was on breaking news and deep dives on current events. "I did a ton of animal stories," recalled correspondent Keith Morrison, who has been with the program since its birth aside from a short stint as a morning news anchor in his native Canada. "There were three different episodes on Keiko, the whale in 'Free Willy.'" But when the show aired an episode centered on a wrongful conviction or grisly murder, "people stood up and paid attention," Mr. Morrison said. The highest-rated episode ever was a 1998 murder-mystery titled "Cliffhanger," about a woman falling from a cliff. "Dateline" partnered with Court TV in the late '90s to document courtroom dramas that became popular after the O.J. Simpson trial. "But we became more interested in the stories that happened outside of the courtroom," Mr. Corvo said. In the mid-2000s, it generated deafening buzz with a new kind of crime programming: "To Catch a Predator," a hidden-camera show where host Chris Hansen presided over stings targeting pedophiles. The sub-franchise concluded in 2007 amid criticism of its tactics. In fall of 2006, Mr. Corvo said they realized that the show needed to be more predictable, and that's when the team started to regularly air hourlong crime stories on Friday nights. It's hard to believe that Mr. Morrison, whose ominous narration has become synonymous with the show, "had to be dragged into" reporting on unsolved cases and other mysteries. "I didn't think it was appropriate, in some way, to ask people very personal questions about these terrible things that happened and then tell that story on TV," Mr. Morrison said over the phone from a farm in North Dakota, where he was filming an episode for the 25th season. But Mr. Morrison said "Dateline" isn't about exploiting the horrors of other people's lives. He is proud of the work the show has done in exposing weaknesses in the criminal justice system. "Dateline" has helped set free at least five inmates who were wrongfully convicted. Staffers mention a show mantra from correspondent Dennis Murphy: "It's not about the murder, it's about the marriage." "It's not about the crime," Mr. Corvo explained, "but everything in the person's background and the story that led to the crime." Mr. Corvo admits that it has become more challenging to find great stories in an era when there's significantly more competition. As much as the strategy for the Friday-night edition has remained consistent, Mr. Corvo said "Dateline" is working to extend the brand both on linear TV and digital and social platforms. Digital offshoots include "Missing in America" and "Cold Case Spotlight," which highlights reports of missing people or cold cases that viewers submit. "Dateline" is also building out its social presence, with Mr. Morrison and other correspondents and producers engaging with its over 400,000 Twitter followers during and after episodes. But ultimately the point of pride is telling a strong narrative that gets to the heart of the human condition, said Mr. Corvo. "I could make these stories last a whole season," Mr. Morrison said. "We are not there yet, but maybe one day."

"Lower for longer is a good thing for the equity markets," Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago, told Reuters. "It basically says risk back on.” In 3.08pm trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.8 percent. In 2.54pm trading, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.6 percent. Gains in shares of Procter & Gamble and those of United Technologies, recently trading 1.2 percent and 1.1 percent stronger respectively, spearheaded the advance of the Dow. Bucking the trend were shares of Pfizer and those of DuPont, down 0.4 percent and 0.3 percent respectively, for the only declines in the Dow in afternoon trading. US Treasuries were steady, with the 10-year note yielding 1.64 percent. “The strategy going forward is to buy duration on dips for investors who agree with us that economic activity and inflation data are unlikely to strengthen into year-end,” Jabaz Mathai, a rates strategist at Citigroup in New York, wrote in a research note, according to Bloomberg. There were fresh signs of strength in the US jobs market. A Labor Department report showed that initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 8,000 to a seasonally adjusted 252,000 for the week ended September 17. “The economy is stronger than we thought with another turn tighter of the screw for the labour market," Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. “If Fed officials are waiting for the economy to improve further before raising rates, they are just too late.” Meanwhile, some say the US greenback is set to weaken. "The US dollar decline has more weeks to go, we think about two months," Hans Redeker, Morgan Stanley’s chief global currency strategist in London, told Bloomberg. "We suggest that the US dollar will extend its decline, index-wise, between 4 percent to 5 percent." In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index ended the day with an increase of 1.6 percent from the previous close. The UK’s FTSE 100 Index advanced 1.1 percent, while Germany’s DAX index and France’s CAC 40 index each rallied 2.3 percent. “The good thing about Europe is that it’s not that expensive and it has the possibility of earnings delivering more than expectations,” Pierre Mouton, a fund manager at Notz, Stucki & Cie in Geneva, told Bloomberg. “The strategists are probably getting less pessimistic, with a good chunk of bad news already behind us. There are good companies out there.” (BusinessDesk) © Scoop Media BusinessDesk Independent, Trustworthy New Zealand Business News The Wellington-based BusinessDesk team led by former Bloomberg Asian top editor Jonathan Underhill and Qantas Award-winning journalist and commentator Pattrick Smellie provides a daily news feed for a serious business audience.

An exception was Twitter, which surged 21.4 percent following reports it is in talks with potential acquirers, including Google and Salesforce.com. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 0.7 percent to 18,261.45. Twitter shares soared after CNBC reported that the microblogging service is in talks with potential acquirers including Google and Salesforce.com ©Leon Neal (AFP/File) The broad-based S&P 500 declined 0.6 percent to 2,164.69, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 0.6 percent to 5,305.75. Google parent Alphabet ended unchanged, while Salesforce dropped 5.6 percent after both were reported to have shown interest in buying Twitter, which has struggled to build on the growth momentum of its early years. Apple fell 1.7 percent on speculation that iPhone sales have been disappointing, while Facebook lost 1.6 percent on concerns about its online advertising prospects after it acknowledged that it had previously counted cases of users watching for as few as three seconds. Oil-linked stocks retreated, with petroleum prices, as Halliburton shed 1.9 percent and ConocoPhillips declined 2.6 percent. Analysts said the market was due for a pullback after the Nasdaq finished at records the last two days following the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates low. Michael James, managing director of Wedbush Securities, said the market is torn between the threat of weak third-quarter earnings and belief that the Fed's easy-money policies will propel stocks even higher. He predicted more volatility, saying "it depends which of those views takes hold on a daily basis." Dow member Procter & Gamble fell 1.4 percent following a report from Bloomberg News that said P&G brands in skin care and men's shaving were losing US market share to competitors. Yahoo sank 3.1 percent following the Thursday disclosure that hackers took data on at least 500 million users, one of the biggest thefts of personal data ever. Marriott International shed 1.9 percent after announcing it completed its $13.6 billion takeover of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide.

The Magazine Antiques Home Articles News & Opinion Directory Calendar The Store Archive That was another country By James Gardner  |  Notes on Photographs by Larry Silver, 1949–1955 at the New-York Historical Society. Precisely because photography is thought to be the most objective of all mediums, it acquires over the course of years, and seemingly in spite of itself, a haunted quality that no other product of visual culture can claim to the same degree. Fig. 9. Leaving Penn Station, 1952. Gelatin silver print 12 by 12 3/4 inches.   The forty-five photographs by Larry Silver that are now on view at the New-York Historical Society are a case in point. When Silver made these images between 1949 and 1955 he was a teenager. The last thing on his mind, one imagines, was to capture the mood or spirit or atmosphere of New York City in the immediate aftermath of World War II. Though beautiful, precocious, and often self-conscious works of art, these photographs seem to aspire to a no-nonsense objectivity fully in keeping with the spirit of the age, with its bullying virility, its pervasive slang, and its working-class mystique. We are in the age of Sinatra here rather than of Rudy Vallee. Click Image to View More Born in the Bronx in 1934, Larry Silver was mentored, while still in high school, by Lou Bernstein and other members of the so-called Photo League who frequented the Peerless Camera Store on East 44th Street. He won a scholarship to the Art Center School in Los Angeles, where he shot a distinguished series of photographs of the body builders along Santa Monica's Muscle Beach. In 1959 he moved back to New York and established himself as a highly successful advertising photographer, whose clients have included American Express, IBM, and Procter & Gamble. In the present exhibition, Silver documents New York City at a crucial instant in its evolution; it stood at the summit of its postwar triumph. In all but the most literal sense, New York was the capital of the United States at the moment when it became the most powerful nation in human history. To a greater degree than ever before or after, New York was the undisputed center of art and literature and music, of industry and leisure, of modernity itself. In one photograph children play beside a construction site that is on its way to becoming the United Nations (Fig. 1), the very embodiment of the postwar world. In another, we experience the quieter charms of New York, as two women rest beside the sparkling waters of the lake in Central Park. An image of Times Square, whose barrage of signage includes a multistory poster of Bette Davis in Dark Victory, beautifully depicts New York in its role as a center of popular culture (Fig. 4). 1 2 3 Next Page » Email To: From: Message: Share This Media Digg Facebook Delicious LinkedIn Print | Email | Share ARTICLES RSS FEED Thank you for signing up.

[Photo: Flickr user Mark Turnauckas] Ruth Reader 09.23.16 12:01 AM Last fall, Barbara*, who works in the marketing department of a holistic pet supplement maker, was in the process of putting together a pricing policy for her company’s products when her boss asked her to look into a site called Jet.com. "They were all over the news at that time," she recalls. The coverage concerned a program called Jet Anywhere. Jet.com was offering "JetCash" to customers when they shopped at merchant sites belonging to Walmart, Amazon, Macy’s, and others. To use this cashback program, consumers would have to go to the Jet Anywhere tab on Jet.com and click on a link to one of those merchants. Once they completed their purchase on the other site, they were directed to forward their purchase confirmation to anywhere@jet.com. Jet would then append "JetCash" to the customer's Jet account, which could be redeemed for money off their next purchase on Jet.com. Not all the merchants linked to on Jet Anywhere had agreed to participate; more than 100 retailers asked Jet.com to remove the discount links, prompting the news coverage. Though Barbara’s company was not among those linked to on Jet Anywhere, her boss wanted her to check out the site and see if their pet supplements were appearing there. Barbara discovered her company’s supplements were being sold on Jet.com. "We don’t allow our products to be on Jet.com, and if you Google us you’ll see us on there," she says. After ordering her company’s product through the website, she was able to determine which distributors had sold to Jet, and promptly issued letters asking them to stop. Roughly a year later, the company’s supplements are still being sold on Jet.com, despite the manufacturer’s best efforts to stop it. Barbara’s company isn’t alone. It turns out a number of high-end pet food manufacturers like Champion Pet Foods, Diamond Pet Foods, Rawz, FROMM Family Foods, Weruva, Naturvet, and Wellness Pet Food all say they don’t distribute through Jet.com, and yet their food appears on its site. Many of the manufacturers I spoke with said they had signed agreements with their distributors specifically stating that they would terminate their business relationship if those distributors sold the manufacturer's goods to Jet.com. But that didn't deter Jet. Related: A Guide To Navigating The Alternative Pet Food Aisle "A representative of [Jet] approached me and said that if we didn’t sell them our product, then they would go and buy it retail," says Ted*, the owner of a pet food manufacturer, who wished not to be named. In other words: When Jet couldn't negotiate deals with fancy pet food makers, Jet representatives went to small bespoke pet stores, bought food off shelves, and resold it online. The Amazon competitor also looked into buying a physical pet store in order to foster a relationship with niche pet food distributors and manufacturers, one well-placed source claims. More often, Jet tried to get mom-and-pop pet shops to act as distributors for its big online marketplace, the source says. But using small stores as distributors isn't easy. Unusually large orders raise flags for manufacturers and their distributors, which could lead to a small store being cut off from a certain product or company. The Problem For Pet Food Manufacturers There are a few reasons why specialty pet food makers may not want to sell to Jet.com. The first is that some prefer to exclusively sell their products through brick-and-mortar shops, because they view that experience as being more white-glove than an online experience. The second reason is manufacturers see Jet as undervaluing their premium products through its discounts. Thirdly, these manufacturers may have signed deals with other online merchants promising not to sell on competing sites. Pet food maker Rawz boasts high-protein, grain-free dog and cat food, claiming it’s the next best thing to a completely raw diet. Raw diets, which can include a blend of bones, raw meat, fish, eggs, organs, and other animal parts, are supposedly healthier for cats and dogs than most manufactured foods. But they are difficult to prepare, have a high ick factor, and can be expensive. Rawz dehydrates a variety of poultry and fish and turns it into kibble. The grain-free food doesn’t come cheap, but consumers know they’re paying for a quality product. The company also donates 100% of its profits to charity. A Jet representative approached Rawz founder and CEO Jim Scott, wanting to sell Rawz on its site, but Scott told them he only sells to brick-and-mortar stores. Scott feels pet specialty shops offer a more personal shopping experience than online stores. Amazon has tried to re-create this same intimacy through reviews, but Scott would argue it’s not the same. Store clerks can wax poetic about the benefits of each product and make personal recommendations to pet owners. "It’s a nutritional consultation, is really what it is, and you can’t get that online," he says. The second reason Scott said no to Jet.com is because of its discount pricing. "It creates the perception that the product is overpriced," he says. Jet.com doesn't consider itself a discount site, though it does offer consumers item price breaks when they buy products in bulk. On its website, Jet explains that it saves money when it can package goods together and in turn can pass savings back to consumers by adding discounts to their overall cart. Consumers can earn further discounts by paying with a debit card rather than a credit card. Here's the shopping cart scheme in Jet's own words: The items you've added can be packed and shipped with other items in your cart. It costs us less to ship multiple items together, so when you add items with the tag to your cart, you pay less. Products whose manufacturers don’t allow discounts won’t drop in price, but don’t worry—our prices are low from the start. Jet says its doesn't offer price breaks on products that manufacturers don't want discounted, but if you put products from any of the brands mentioned above who aren't officially working with Jet in your cart, you'll see discounts applied. That doesn't sit well for brands that want to maintain the perception that their goods are worth a certain amount. For Scott, there’s also a concern that online stores with discounts like Jet.com are a threat to small brick and mortars, because people would rather buy a product they already know from a website with a cheaper price than from their local pet store. Scrappy Tactics This wouldn’t be the first time that Jet founder Marc Lore packed a van full of store-bought goods to later sell on one of his sites. When he was starting up Diapers.com, he was unable to strike an agreement with diaper manufacturers, so he sent out his only employee to a local BJ’s Wholesale Club to buy up diapers in order to fulfill orders being placed on the site, according to a Bloomberg Businessweek feature on the company’s early days. Eventually Diapers.com was able to convince major manufacturers like Proctor & Gamble to work with them. In the Businessweek article, the ploy comes off as a scrappy way to circumvent the big dogs, who refused to sell to Lore because his operations were initially too small to bother with. But the tactic is perhaps a little less admirable when used to dodge the wishes of niche manufacturers who want to limit the number and scope of retailers they work with. As a salesperson at one of the manufacturers put it, "They’re like hackers. You cut off one source and they find another entry point." Of course, this kind of behavior from a major e-commerce player isn’t uncommon. Amazon’s well-documented rub with the publishing industry illustrates the way online discounters can put the squeeze on companies that don’t comply with its interests. When it comes to inventory, Amazon has the added advantage of its glut of third-party merchants. Amazon's roughly 2 million third-party retailers, often small independent stores looking for larger distribution, are responsible for almost half of units shipped on Amazon's platform. That allows Amazon to have a diverse product offering without having to deal with manufacturers directly. While some of the pet food manufacturers I spoke with were equally unhappy with their products being on Amazon, they said it was easier to get in touch with an Amazon merchant and have their products pulled offline than it was to negotiate with Jet. These third-party merchants do make it hard for Jet to compete with Amazon in terms of breadth of merchandise. But is circumventing manufacturers who don’t want to do business with them an appropriate workaround? Manufacturers would say no. Is This Legal? The strange tactic is probably legal, but it's definitely not standard business practice. In most circumstances, businesses are not selling a product for less than they acquired it for. Thanks to its oodles of venture capital, Jet.com has been in a unique position to lose money. Pet manufacturers assert there’s an issue of food quality at stake, too, because they can’t guarantee the product that Jet.com is selling is being stored properly or sold within its shelf life. They're concerned that if Jet is negligent with sell-by dates, customers might get a stale representation of their food, or worse, someone's pet might get sick. The practice of selling a product without the manufacturer's blessing could also cause contractual issues for food makers. Some pet food brands have exclusivity deals with Amazon and Chewy.com, a discount site that only sells pet accoutrements. So when Jet.com obtains products outside the usual channels, manufacturers say it may put them in breach of contract if they’re obligated not to sell to a competing site. Legalities aside, it's pretty obtuse for a company of Jet's size and valuation to ask the very small pet boutiques it plans on undercutting to be complicit in circumventing upscale food manufacturers that don't want to sell on its platform. And it would be difficult to argue that Jet might be putting small pet speciality retailers out of business through its competitive pricing. But if Jet is shown to be contributing to the demise of these shops by underpricing them, potentially limiting competition, the point is moot if some stores are actively helping Jet do so by selling product to Jet off the shelf. Manufacturers, too, might have difficulty trying to win a suit against Jet—especially if they band together. If it appears that a group of pet food manufacturers are collectively deciding not to sell to the online retailer, an argument could be made that they're boycotting Jet, which is considered anti-competitive behavior. In general, anyone can sell anything (unless they’ve stolen it) to anyone for any price they see fit. Once a product leaves a manufacturer, they typically don’t care what happens to it. A shirt bought at Barney's can be resold repeatedly on eBay. The only time that isn’t true is if that company or person is doing the above in a way that interferes with competition. Then it becomes an anti-trust issue. But for the reasons outlined above, it would be very hard to make the case that Jet is acting anti-competitively. Though Jet.com’s unconventional product acquisition maneuvers may not be explicitly illegal, they are definitely weird and have earned the wrath of manufacturers. Walmart, Jet’s soon-to-be parent, has not said whether or not it will end this practice. When we reached out to the superstore, a representative said, "We are building a detailed integration plan based on our complementary capabilities and what makes the best sense to drive the business and provide the best experience for our customers." *Sources have been given alternative names to preserve their anonymity.

I would be spending more time on these areas,” he said. The company, which clocked annual revenue of around Rs 3,000 crore ($450 million) in financial year 2015-16, generates about 51 per cent of its business from three verticals — process engineering, industrial products and medical devices. Its top 30 clients are Fortune 500 companies, including Eaton, BMW, Rockwell Automation, P&G, Shell, UTC, John Deere and Calsonic Kanseer. According to L&T Group Chairman A M Naik, the company is targeting a 15 per cent increase in revenue to $525 million (around Rs 3,502 crore) in the current financial year and wants to double revenue to $1 billion over the next three-four years. Remaining bullish about demand and growth, Panda said the company will grow more than the industry. The global engineering addressable market is about $365 billion (around Rs 24.35 lakh crore), of which only $67 billion (about Rs 4.46 lakh crore) has been tapped. The Indian engineering, research and development services market, which reached $20 billion in 2015, is expected to touch $38 billion (about Rs 2.53 lakh crore) by 2020, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 13.7 per cent. The other important area that the company plans to continue investing in is innovation and talent acquisition. “Innovation depends on our young engineers. Right now, we have 9,400 employees, I started with 1,400 (in 2010) and we have added about 8,000 engineers over five years, more engineers than what L&T has,” he said. The company made its stock market debut at Rs 920 per share, seven per cent more than its issue price of Rs 860. The Rs 894-crore issue, which opened for subscription between September 12 and 15, was subscribed 2.52 times.

Jordan Wathen (TMFValueMagnet) Sep 23, 2016 at 6:05AM Image source: Getty Images. The best dividend ETF should pay a high yield from a diversified portfolio of dividend stocks while offering the potential for investors to earn additional returns from capital appreciation. To that end, here's a list of what I believe to be the five best dividend ETFs out of more than 100 dividend ETFs on the market today: Dividend ETF Ticker Annual Expense Ratio Dividend Yield (SEC Yield) Type Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF VIG 0.09% 2.1% Dividend Achievers Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF VYM 0.09% 3.1% Diversified mid- and large cap stocks Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF SCHD 0.07% 3.1% Quality large cap stocks SPDR S&P Dividend ETF SDY 0.35% 2.4% Dividend aristocrats WisdomTree SmallCap Dividend Fund DES 0.38% 3.1% Small cap Sources: Vanguard, Charles Schwab, State Street Global Advisors, WisdomTree. Before buying any of these, it's important to know how the funds work. Here's the case for each fund, and why each one deserves a spot in the list of the best dividend ETFs for an income portfolio. Vanguard's dividend Goliath The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF lays claim to being the largest dividend ETF, with assets of more than $22.5 billion. It's not hard to see why this fund is so popular, given its tiny annual expense ratio of 0.09% of assets and a focus on high-quality dividend-paying companies. This isn't your average dividend ETF. The fund tracks the NASDAQ US Dividend Achievers Select Index, which invests in companies that have paid increasing dividends for at least 10 consecutive years, excluding REITs and master limited partnerships. The index uses proprietary and undisclosed screening mechanisms to sort out the top companies from a broader dividend index. Broadly diversified, the fund held 185 different mega and large-cap companies at the time of this writing, with its largest stakes in popular dividend stocks such as Johnson & Johnson, Microsoft, and PepsiCo. But keep in mind that this fund is focused primarily on capital appreciation over income. The fund's investments had an average yield of just 2.1% at the time of this writing, putting the ETF's yield roughly in line with the S&P 500. What makes this fund so attractive to investors is that it has roughly matched the return of the S&P 500 while investing in companies with rock-solid dividend policies. In addition, a focus on blue-chip stocks with the capacity to grow their dividends resulted in less pain during the Great Financial Crisis, when the fund lost much less of its value than the stock market on average. Vanguard's simple yield ETF What would happen if you took a list of high-yield large cap stocks, sorted it by dividend yield, and then invested in the highest-yielding half? Well, you'd get something that looks a lot like the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF. The strategy isn't particularly fancy, but it works. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which invests in the highest-yielding of U.S. stocks in the FTSE All-World Index, excluding only REITs. The fund weights each stock by market cap, thus investing most heavily in dividend-paying large-cap companies. Despite its simplicity, returns have been excellent, beating the S&P 500 marginally over the most recent three- and five-year periods, largely because of outsize dividend yields. At the time of this writing, the fund offered a yield of about 3.1%, roughly 50% more than the S&P 500. Note that this is one of the most diversified ETFs on the list -- it holds more than 420 stocks -- yet it carries an annual expense ratio of just 0.09% a year. That's a very low price to pay to get broad diversification across dividend stocks in every sector. Schwab's fundamentally focused dividend ETF A late entrant into exchange-traded funds, Charles Schwab has rapidly attracted assets with its low-cost ETFs. The Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF is no exception, boasting a microscopic 0.07% annual expense ratio that makes it the least expensive of any fund on this list. The prominent feature of this fund is that its methodology is designed to select from the very best of dividend-paying stocks. The ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, which invests in large-cap stocks that have paid dividends annually for the past 10 years. Importantly, the index also considers fundamental metrics in stock selection, requiring that companies have high cash flow to debt, earn a high return on equity, offer a generous dividend yield, and have a history of dividend growth. Like other ETFs on this list, it excludes bond-like companies such as real estate investment trusts, which offer high yields but less opportunity for capital appreciation. This fund favors large-cap stocks, because of its market-cap weighting. The top three holdings are Intel, Procter & Gamble, and Microsoft, common companies in any high-quality portfolio. Its 3.1% yield stands out as one of the highest, but note that it isn't as diversified as other funds, as it holds only 100 different stocks. State Street's royal dividend ETF After a company increases its dividend for 25 consecutive years, it joins an elite group of stocks known as "dividend aristocrats." The SPDR S&P Dividend ETF invests in these companies by tracking the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes companies that have consistently increased their dividends for 20 years in a row. Relaxing the requirement to 20 years of dividend increases from 25 years doesn't necessarily cost much in the way of portfolio quality, but it does allow for a little more diversification. (A stricter dividend aristocrats ETF sponsored by ProShares holds just 50 stocks.) Note that this ETF held 108 stocks at the time of this writing and was most heavily invested in traditional high-yield sectors including utilities, financial services, and industrials.  State Street's ETF is a little different in that it weights stocks in the portfolio by their indicative yield. Thus, a stock that has a dividend yield of 5% will make up a bigger part of the portfolio than a stock that yields just 3%, for example. The result is that the fund tends to invest more heavily in slower-growing companies that return more of their income to shareholders. At the time of this writing, its three largest holdings were HCP Inc., People's United Financial, and Caterpillar. (Its largest holding, HCP, is a REIT, which would be excluded from many other ETFs on this list.) Performance has been spectacular, as the ETF has put up annualized returns that were about 0.5 percentage points better than the S&P 500 over the last five- and 10-year periods. This is especially impressive when you consider that the ETF carries a much higher annual expense ratio (0.35%) than other dividend ETFs. With a current yield of about 2.4%, the fund has a slight advantage over the S&P 500's 2.1% yield. WisdomTree's fund for big yields from small stocks Most dividend ETFs focus on large companies and completely ignore high-yield small caps. WisdomTree's SmallCap Dividend Fund is a great way to round out a dividend portfolio so that it includes dividend payers of all sizes, not just megacap companies. This fund selects stocks by ranking all dividend-paying stocks by size and then throwing out the largest 300 stocks, as well as stocks with market caps of less than $100 million, which can be impractical for some funds to own. The largest companies that make up 75% of the remaining companies' total market cap are put into WisdomTree's large and mid-cap dividend ETFs. The smallest companies, which make up 25% of the value of the list, are put into the WisdomTree SmallCap Dividend Fund. WisdomTree weights stocks in the portfolio by the total dollar amount of dividends it expects a company to pay over the next year. The result is a diversified portfolio of about 700 different investments, many of which won't be familiar to investors who primarily stick to American large caps. Targa Resources (oil and gas services), Cal-Maine Foods (egg farmer and distributor), and Covanta Holding Corp. (waste disposal) were the three largest companies in its portfolio. Small caps typically generate higher returns, albeit with more volatility, than large-cap stocks. It's notable that the WisdomTree SmallCap Dividend Fund has beaten the returns of stock indexes large and small, trouncing both the S&P 500 (large caps) and Russell 2000 (small caps) over the most recent five- and 10-year periods. It also pays out a much higher dividend yield of about 3.1% vs. about 1.6% for the Russell 2000 and 2.1% for the S&P 500. If there is one big downside, it's that the ETF leans toward the costly side. An annual expense ratio of 0.38% is cheap compared with active funds, particularly active small-cap funds, but it is the highest of any ETF on this list. That said, if the fund's forward returns look anything like its historical returns, investors will find it easy to look past higher expenses.    Jordan Wathen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

However, audiences are no longer a given. Publishers and advertisers need to meticulously tailor their content to survive in the cutthroat media terrain. Disruption in our industry is the norm The internet is maturing and evolving at an unprecedented speed. Disruption is the norm and advertisers need to react with agility and intuition. While traditional online display advertising still makes a profit, rising challenges such as banner blindness among readers are limiting its effectiveness. Native advertising, content marketing and/or remarketing are climbing the ranks as real options to make money from a publishers’s digital audience. The emergence of ad blocking A key issue on the global digital advertising agenda is ad blocking. While ad blocking is still in it’s infancy and relatively low in South Africa, it does hold the potential to impact the ability for advertisers to achieve the laser point ‘holy grail’ of ‘right message, right person, right time’ and of course, more recently, ‘right device’. This has a bearing on actual acquisition costs and efficiency. As marketing is driven by cost per acquisition, ad blocking limits audience reach, regardless of what platform they are using. A united front to counter ad blocking As a global organisation, the IAB is spearheading the digital advertising industry’s reaction to this phenomenon. On September 15 2016, the Coalition for Better Ads was announced in Cologne, Germany, at the Dmexco conference. In addition to the IAB, founding members include heavyweights such as Google, Facebook, Procter & Gamble, Unilever, the 4As, the Association of National Advertisers, the World Federation of Advertisers, The Washington Post and GroupM. Using technology currently being developed at the IAB’s Tech Lab, the consortium aims to monitor digital ad campaigns, scoring them on everything from creative to load time. Standards will be set using data gleaned from the system as well as from consumer feedback and input from marketers. As IAB CEO Randall Rothenberg says, it is critical that, as an industry, we create standards that ensure that consumers get safe, fast, secure delivery of the sites and services they love. So far, ad blocking has been less of a challenge in our ‘mobile-first’ context. That does not mean that South African publishers do not need to prepare for ad blocking as they grow their digital presence and audiences. Rather, the idea that global audiences feel led to block out irrelevant advertising should shape what we choose to publish, and how we engage with readers that are becoming increasingly discerning. Ultimately, it’s about great content The internet cannot survive without content. In South Africa, we have reached a crossroads rich in opportunity. While our oldest print and press partners are experiencing challenges, our digital industry is hungry for excellent content. We cannot afford to lose good journalists with years of experience because one segment of the media is struggling. As the IAB SA, we are committed to finding ways to supporting our various member sectors to integrate journalists that can no longer work in the print environment, finding them a place within the digital ecosystem. We aim to turn the disruption within print into dialogue. This speaks to the digital publishing industry’s need to deliver relevant content to their audiences in a seamless manner. This content is created by skilled teams that need to be paid competitive salaries. Therefore, digital advertising needs to evolve in such a way that online teams are able to monetise their business and keep creating great content.  It’s also about getting to know your users We recommend publishers and brands engage more intimately with their users to establish want they will and won’t accept to remain loyal readers and customers. Open up a dialogue with users so they can contribute to the boundaries of their experience of the platform and what will serve them best. Enhance their experience by making it seamless and laser pointed in its relevance to the individual. Humans are more than a set of data points, possessing their own idiosyncrasies and preferences. They are consumers of content, but also consumers of relevant products and services. The right advert addresses an individual need. In this sense, digital advertising should be a welcome diversion and not a rude interruption. If we strike this balance, publishers and ultimately their advertisers will retain, or in some cases win back, the trust of their audiences.

The number of S&P 500 companies with buybacks over $1 billion dropped to a 3-year low in the second quarter of 2016, according to data released by FactSet this week. Overall, fewer companies were opting to buy back any stock at all, marking the lowest participation rate since the end of 2010. Microsoft announced Wednesday that it was authorizing up to $40 billion in buybacks. (The software company did not reveal a timeframe for the buybacks and told CNBC it has "nothing further to share" on timing.) In the last quarter, we've seen other big spenders including Apple ($10.9 billion) and GE ($7.6 billion). Those two companies are also leading the market for most stock repurchased in the last 12 months. In the last decade, companies have spent large sums on stock buybacks, which are often used to boost the price of the remaining shares and to prop up per-share earnings. Despite the decline in buybacks last quarter, S&P 500 companies are still using an extremely large amount of their income to buy back their own shares. They spent nearly 72 percent of net income over the last 12 months on buybacks — up about 17 percent from a year ago. With debt high and earnings expected to fall, buybacks will likely be even less affordable in coming quarters, especially if the U.S. Federal Reserve decides to raise interest rates. Put Microsoft's $40 billion purchase in context: If the company does buy that full amount, and it doesn't reissue any of those shares, then that $40 billion alone would be bigger than most S&P 500 companies have done in total over the last 10 years. Only 14 companies in the S&P 500 have spent at least $40 billion in net stock buybacks over the past decade. The leaders include ExxonMobil ($189 billion), Apple ($111 billion), IBM ($109 billion), Microsoft ($101 billion), Walmart ($66 billion), Pfizer ($60 billion), Procter and Gamble ($48 billion), Home Depot ($47 billion), and HP ($47 billion). There is some evidence that buybacks may not help support a company's share price over the long term. FactSet's data showed that companies with repurchase programs have underperformed the S&P 500 in the past year by more than 5 percentage points. The Fed decided to leave rates unchanged in its September meeting on Wednesday, but if credit tightens, more companies may find that burning cash or taking out debt for buybacks simply aren't worth the cost.

By Josh Kolm September 22, 2016 Publicis Groupe has announced a number of new leadership appointments within its Publicis Communications division that will see a number of agency leaders, including several from Canada, receiving expanded roles. Publicis Communications is one of four “solutions hubs” the holding company created as part of a restructuring announced late last year and includes all of the group’s advertising and creative agencies: Publicis Worldwide, MSL, Nurun, Saatchi & Saatchi, Leo Burnett, BBH, Marcel and production hub Prodigious. The new model was meant to make agencies within each “hub” more collaborative with each other in their work with clients. Andrew Bruce (pictured, left), previously North American CEO of Publicis Worlwide and a former CEO of Publicis Worldwide Canada, has been named North American CEO of Publicis Communications. Kurt Ritter, previously chairman and CEO of Saatchi & Saatchi LA and Team One and chairman of Saatchi & Saatchi Canada, will be chairman for North America, while Suellen Ravanas, EVP and CFO for Leo Burnett in North America, will be Publicis Communications’ CFO for the region. In addition, Carla Serrano, CEO of Publicis New York and Bill Kanarick, chief strategy officer of the holding company’s digitally focused group Publicis.Sapient, have been named co-CSOs of Publicis Communications. The move is meant to foster collaboration between agencies within Publicis Communications and those within Publicis.Sapient, which include Sapient, DigitasLBi and Razorfish. At the agency level, Judy John will retain her role as Leo Burnett Canada’s CEO, but has now been named chief creative officer for Leo across North America. Brent Nelsen, Canada’s chief strategy officer, has also had his role expanded to cover the agency’s offices across North America. John and Nelsen will work with the global leadership team of Rich Stoddart – the agency’s previous North American CEO who was named Tom Bernardin’s successor as global CEO in January – and Mark Tutssel, global CCO. Leo Burnett in particular has already been highly collaborative in recent years, with the Canadian office working with talent from offices worldwide on clients like P&G. Arthur Sadoun, CEO of Publicis Communications, said in a press release that the new appointments are meant to “accelerate” early momentum the group has seen from business wins in the first nine months since it was formed, as well as to encourage further collaboration by having less burdensome leadership structures at the local level. Other Publicis Communications agencies have seen similar appointments. Valérie Henaff, CEO of Publicis Worldwide’s Publicis Conseil in France, has also been named the agency’s global president. At Saatchi & Saatchi, global CCO Kate Stanners will also serve as the agency’s global chairwoman.

Opinion: Millennial cosmetics IPO offers potentially beautiful returns MarketWatch 9/22/2016 Michael Brush © Phillip Waterman/Getty Images Young women window shopping, taking photograph with smartphone A lot of companies have a hard time connecting with two key consumer groups: millennials and Hispanics. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▲ 110.17 +0.22 +0.20% Abercrombie & Fitch Co ANF ▼ 14.63 -2.30 -13.59% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 759.02 +2.62 +0.35% Ross Stores Inc ROST ▲ 68.03 +2.50 +3.81% So it’s worth taking a look — and consider buying shares — when you find one that gets it right. That’s what we have with e.l.f. Beauty Inc., a hot cosmetics upstart that begins life as a public company Sept. 23. It priced at $17 a share, raising $141.7 million. The Oakland, Calif.-based company sells self-described “high-quality” beauty products, often inspired by hits from prestigious and pricier brands like Sephora. This approach works. Sales at e.l.f (ELF) are growing at a fast clip — 32% a year on average from 2012 to 2015. A key part of the story here is that e.l.f. is a thoroughly modern company in two big ways. 1. It relies heavily on social media for valuable cues on product development and marketing. 2. It borrows a winning concept from apparel known as “fast fashion.” This means the ability to do quick turnarounds on new products to meet the rapidly changing tastes of fickle consumers. Here’s a quick look at the strong points of the first millennial cosmetics company as well as some of the risks. The price is right It’s hard to argue with good prices, as long as the quality is there. And e.l.f. seems to get the mix right, judging by robust sales growth. Most cosmetics go for $6 or less. For example, e.l.f. offers a mineral-infused face primer for $6, compared with $36 for a similar product at upscale competitors like Sephora. Then there’s the Baked Eyeshadow Trio at $4, versus $28. And the e.l.f. Lip Exfoliator at $3 versus $24. Read:Here’s the breakdown of stock IPOs for the remainder of 2016 Everyone likes a bargain. But at these prices, customers can readily experiment and “play beautifully” — which happens to be the company’s motto. “The pricing strategy is brilliant,” says Tom Taulli, author of “High-Profit IPO Strategies: Finding Breakout IPOs for Investors and Traders.” The low prices for high quality are effective marketing “because once customers buy, they keep buying more,” he says. Free help from YouTube “consultants” A lot of companies save on costs by using external employees, but e.l.f. has pushed this concept to the max. And this is a big plus for investors since it boosts profitability. Here’s how this trick works. Like most businesses, e.l.f. engages with consumers on Instagram, Facebook (FB)(TWTR) and Google’s (GOOG) YouTube — where women post videos and reviews about e.l.f. products. But e.l.f. goes a step further. It closely studies the videos and feedback, to cook up the next big hit. Next, it tests new products on its website and studies sales trends and online commentary. Finally, it culls winners for wider distribution through its main sales channels — big retailers like (WMT) Target (TGT) CVS Health (CVS) and Old Navy, a division of the Gap (GPS) E.l.f. has nine stores and a website, but these retailers together handle about 90% of sales. This approach is clever because it keeps the hits rolling. “They have been very good at introducing new products. They are hitting the right trends in the young demographic,” says Kathleen Smith, an IPO expert with Renaissance Capital, which manages IPO-focused exchange traded funds (ETF) like the Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO) This approach also produces huge cost savings. That helps you as an investor. For example, last year e.l.f. spent just 3% of sales ($3.9 million) on marketing, compared with 20% on average at the five biggest cosmetics companies. Obviously, the boost to margins here is good for shareholders. E.l.f. says it views its customers as its “stars,” and you should, too, as an investor. Customers don’t seem to mind chipping in for free, in this way. They view it as part of a valuable “relationship” with the company, says e.l.f. “Our consumers are part of the process, and know that their feedback is valuable and impacts the brand,” the company says in filings. Fast fashion, meet makeup E.l.f was founded in 2004 by the father-and-son team of Alan and Joey Shamah, who worked long enough in retail to know the importance of “fast fashion.” Retailers like H&M, Forever 21, Primark and Zara shook up the apparel business by tightening up supply chains so much, they can quickly roll out new styles to capitalize on a flash trend. Then they move on to the next, leaving more traditional players like J.C. Penney (JCP) and Macy’s (M) in the dust. The father-and-son team decided to apply the same concept to cosmetics. And e.l.f. was born. “They can pump out a product fairly quickly,” says Taulli. “This is a new spin on the traditional manufacturer in cosmetics.” The company can launch a new product in as little as five months, which is pretty fast for retail. Fast fashion means fast growth All of this adds up to hot growth: 32% sales growth last year. And thanks to that army of free YouTube and Instagram consultants who help keep costs down, an ever-growing piece of sales gets converted into profits, as sales expand. For example, a form of cash flow known as EBITDA (or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) grew 64% last year to $46.2 million. As for the bottom line, it flipped to green from red. A loss of $2.9 million turned into a net profit of $4.4 million. There is a lot of blue sky ahead. E.l.f. says its sales represent only 2.3% of the U.S. mass cosmetics market, which was worth $8 billion in sales last year. The company hopes to expand its customer base by developing mass appeal, getting into more stores and commanding more floor space in stores. It also has a nice tailwind. The U.S. cosmetics market overall, worth $14 billion last year, is growing at a rapid clip. It grew 5% a year from 2010 to 2015. E.l.f. also wants to expand into skin care, a market worth $16 billion in annual sales in the U.S. This could benefit investors nicely because margins are higher, says Renaissance Capital’s Smith. The company also has lots of room to expand abroad since it gets only about 7% of sales there now. Risks Yes, there are risks. 1. The big one is that e.l.f. has to keep the growth rate up. And this might be tough in such a competitive industry. Combatants include big players like Estee Lauder (EL) Procter & Gamble (PG) Revlon (REV) and L’Oreal. 2. It’s also a bit troubling that the investment shop that has owned e.l.f. for the past few years, TPG Growth II Management, is selling a big chunk of its stake in the initial public offering. That’s not exactly a vote of confidence. “But at least the CEO is not selling shares on the offering,” says Smith. And TPG will still own a big stake, despite its sale. 3. Another ding here is that the company recently took on debt to pay insiders and TPG a $72 million dividend. It will use a lot of the IPO proceeds to pay down that debt, as opposed to investing in the business. And, finally, there is the Donald Trump factor. A big part of his platform is “bringing jobs back home.” E.l.f. manufactures in China. So if Trump wins and succeeds at getting high tariffs on imported goods, investors might be left shelling out for concealers to cover up their scars.

(AAPL), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC) and Coty Inc (COTY) Options activity provides a bit of insight on AAPL, WFC and COTY stock By Joseph Hargett, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Sep 22, 2016, 8:56 am EST     Popular Posts: Monday’s Vital Data: Bank of America Corp (BAC), Facebook Inc (FB) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) 2 Post-Trump Trades for Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Earnings Recent Posts: Thursday’s Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO) Nike Inc (NKE) Stock Can’t Count on a Save From Santa Claus Wednesday’s Vital Data: Facebook Inc (FB), Chevron Corporation (CVX) and United States Steel Corporation (X) View All Posts U.S. stock futures are headed higher once again this morning, as Wall Street seems relieved that the Federal Reserve didn’t raise interest rates at this week’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting. However, Fed Chair Janet Yellen did indicate that a hike is likely before the end of the year. On the economic front today, weekly jobless claims, the August Chicago Fed national activity index, August existing home sales and August leading indicators are all slated for release later this morning. Against this backdrop, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average have added 0.44%, while S&P 500 futures are up 0.44% and Nasdaq-100 futures have risen 0.5%. Wednesday’s options activity was brisk, as traders reacted to the Fed’s decision to hold pat on interest rates for the time being. Overall, an above-average 17.8 million calls and 17.5 million puts changed hands on the session. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio rose to 0.63, while the 10-day moving average rebounded to 0.65. 9 Dividend Stocks for a Full Calendar of Safe Income Analyst action provided the fuel for Wednesday’s options volume, with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) upgraded again on prospects for iPhone 7 unit sales, while Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) was downgraded amid its latest fraud firestorm. Finally, Coty Inc (NYSE:COTY) options traders continued to pile into COTY after the stock was downgraded. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Apple received yet another upgrade in the wake of positive preorders reports for the iPhone 7. This time UBS lifted its price target on AAPL stock to $127 from $115; the consensus target is $124.91 according to Thomson/First Call. While UBS said it doesn’t see demand for the iPhone 7 coming in better than the iPhone 6, the brokerage cited “encouraging Evidence Lab analysis of search volumes” for the target hike. Additionally, UBS said that Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) isn’t seeing the same preorder demand as its competitors, lending a bit of caution to the research report. Options traders are also expressing a bit of caution on AAPL stock. Yesterday’s volume was strong, with 930,000 contracts changing hands. And while the fact that calls made up 63% of Wednesday’s activity would be a bullish indicator for most other stocks, for AAPL, it’s only par for the course. Emphasizing the point, Apple’s September/October put/call open interest ratio currently rests at 0.90, which is high for AAPL and indicates that puts and calls are in near parity among options set to expire within the next two months. Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) Wells Fargo has really stepped in it this time, with reports of account fraud drawing severe scrutiny from federal regulators and Senate hearings. With pressure mounting on the company, analysts are reevaluating their positions, and J.P. Morgan decided to lower its stance on the banking giant. Citing the rising maelstrom around Wells Fargo, J.P. Morgan cut its price target to $48 from $53.50 — a move that runs counter to upgrades from Morgan Stanley and R.W. Baird in the past two sessions. The weight of the situation is even beginning to drag sentiment in the options pits lower. On Wednesday, WFC saw volume rise to nearly 428,000 contracts, with puts snapping up 58% of the day’s take. Short-term speculators have loaded up on out-of-the-money puts, with more than 12,000 of these bearish contracts accumulating at the $44 strike — a target that WFC could realistically hit before the close on Friday if the situation continues to escalate. Coty Inc. (COTY) Cosmetics company Coty has been a hotbed of speculation this week for options traders. The shares have plunged more than 19% since mid-August, but recently, COTY appears to be putting in a bottom near $24. Support in the $24 region was put to the test on Wednesday after Zacks downgraded the stock to “hold” from “strong buy.” Even Jim Cramer got in on the act, advising followers to sell COTY stock in favor of Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG). Fitbit Inc (FIT) Stock Is in Tip-Top Shape Options traders appeared slightly hopeful for COTY on Wednesday, however. Total volume came in at nearly 219,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 53% of the day’s take. Looking out to October, call OI for COTY is focused on the $25 strike, where 2,500 contracts currently reside. By comparison, 3,800 puts are open at the October $24 strike for the same series. As of this writing, Joseph Hargett did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Photo: Bloomberg News By Alexandra Bruell Alexandra Bruell The Wall Street Journal CANCEL BiographyAlexandra Bruell alexandra.bruell@wsj.com Sept. 21, 2016 7:33 p.m. ET 0 COMMENTS Japanese ad holding company Dentsu has notified client Toyota of irregularities in its transactions, according to a statement from the automotive giant. “While we are not in a position to provide additional details, we have been notified by Dentsu of irregularities in some digital media business transactions,” said Toyota in a statement from the company’s global headquarters. Dentsu did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but has been in touch with at least one analyst that covers its business. “While the scale of the matter is unknown, Dentsu investor relations has indicated to us that they do not anticipate any material impact to the company from the situation,” said Brian Wieser, senior analyst at Pivotal Research, in a note Wednesday. After an internal investigation by Toyota, the ad and media company faces questions about digital media transactions going back at least five years, according to the Financial Times. The incident, first reported by Australian publication AdNews, comes amid allegations of non-transparent business practices by media agencies in the U.S., and as the industry grapples with how to handle a breakdown in trust between agencies and clients. Dentsu dominates the ad and media business in Japan, but the holding company derived more than half of its business from markets outside of Japan in fiscal 2015. That was up 15% from 2012, when it agreed to acquire U.K.-based media agency Aegis Group in a $5 billion deal. The company has completed more than 80 acquisitions in the past three years and counts large global advertisers like Toyota, General Motors and Procter & Gamble among its clients. Unlike Dentsu’s operations in the U.S., its Japanese interests encompass both media brands and the agencies that buy commercial space from those media brands.
