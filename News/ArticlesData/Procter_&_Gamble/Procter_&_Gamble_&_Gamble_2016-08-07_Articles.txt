Emsley joins Tongal from Saatchi & Saatchi, where he most recently served as both global CEO on the P&G business and strategic advisor to global chairman Kevin Roberts, who announced his resignation last week following a Business Insider interview in which he made controversial comments about gender diversity. “Brands today need a new kind of partner to develop creative that is authentic, targeted and efficiently produced for every platform, from TV commercials to social and original content. Vaughan, a top agency and marketing expert, has identified Tongal as the creative model for the future, and we’re thrilled to welcome him to the leadership team,” Tongal co-founder and CEO Rob Salvatore said in a statement. A longtime veteran of Saatchi & Saatchi, Emsley originally joined the agency as regional account director for Pampers Europe and the Middle East in 1991 and later became regional director for P&G in the Asia/Pacific region. In 2000, he was named global equity director for Iams and Eukanuba, and became global brand agency leader for Pampers two years after that. After three years in that role, he was named executive vice president and head of the global P&G account, spending eight years in that role before being named global head of planning and transformation in October of 2013. “Tongal is the new model for creating content, and is a major challenge to the existing agency model, which isn’t giving brands what they need to communicate with today’s audiences across a growing range of media environments.” said Emsley. “Combining Tongal’s huge creative network with sharp strategic direction and true human insight provides a winning alternative for marketers looking for relevance and success. Before joining Tongal, I conferred with many client-side marketers, and everyone’s advice was the same – they said, ‘Do it, this is what we need.'” *For God’s sake, do not call it “Like Uber, but for advertising.” < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Photo: AFP mail print View all comments Tweet By Lucy Kellaway - - Published: 4:00 AM, August 9, 2016 Updated: 8:29 AM, August 10, 2016 Last week, I stumbled upon an article by the chief executive of Boston Consulting Group telling twentysomethings how to “accelerate” their careers. Mr Rich Lesser has based his advice on his own splendid, if safe, one — a few years at Procter & Gamble followed by an MBA from Harvard, and then 28 years at BCG. Along the way, he has spoken to thousands of young people and felt moved to tell them where they were going wrong — and how they could become more like him. The piece was on LinkedIn months ago, but BCG is so taken by Mr Lesser’s insights that it is still trumpeting them on social media. However, when I read the article through to its conclusion — “with self-reflection, focus, and a commitment to investing in yourself and making a difference, you can find the place that is right for you” — boredom gave way to alarm. This was very bad advice indeed, and I needed to protect twentysomethings from trying to follow it. His first tip is to choose “something you find truly energising and satisfying”. This sounds okay, but there are three things wrong with it. It is vapid — no one would recommend a job that was enervating and frustrating. Second, it is unhelpful, as when you are in your twenties, it is hard to know if you are going to find a job satisfying until you have tried it. Third, it sets expectations far too high. Even the best jobs are only intermittently energising or satisfying. For a lot of the time, they are boring or frustrating, or both. The gap between expectation and reality is the biggest problem for millennials, and Mr Lesser ought not to widen it. Next, he suggests going for an employer where you will learn things. “Your twenties are a unique period to build a set of capabilities that will last a lifetime.” No, they are not. No set of capabilities, as he puts it, lasts more than a decade or two apart, possibly, from the ability to form a sentence, add up and get on with people. Skills and experience get out of date. His next criterion — Can I make a difference? — is more problematic still. Not only is this the wrong thing for 20-year-olds to ask, as no one makes a difference when starting out, it is wrong for people of any age. I am not sure why we have become so hooked on difference-making per se. Surely it all depends what the difference is. The palliative care nurse at the Whittington hospital who nursed my father in the last days of his life made a difference I will never forget. Equally, British retail tycoon Philip Green made a difference that the 20,000 pensioners at BHS will not forget in a hurry, either. For most wage slaves, it is hard to say what difference we make, but that does not render our jobs pointless. Do management consultants make a difference? Do I? It all depends on your starting point. I imagine today I will make a minor difference to Mr Lesser — though perhaps not a positive one. His final question is the worst of all — Can I find balance? The answer to this is no, as there is no such thing as balance. Instead, all workers have a choice: Working all the time, or not working all the time. It would be better if the CEO of one of the grandest management consultancies in the world told 20-year-olds that he ran a sweatshop for the elite and that working there would mean having to cancel all dates, all birthday parties and all fun outings at a moment’s notice. Like Mr Lesser, I have had a safe, unimaginative sort of career involving just two employers: JPMorgan and the Financial Times. But since my day, and since Mr Lesser’s, two big things have changed. For us, the corporate life was more or less compulsory if you were interested in business; now it is optional as there are start-ups instead. Some people are suited to life in big corporations, others less so. It is hard to know until you try it, so my advice is to take a corporate job early on to find out how much you (dis)like it. The second change is that working life is now so long, there is no hurry to get it right the first time — which leads to my second point. If you take a few bad turns, it does not matter. In deciding to go for P&G and then BCG, Mr Lesser drew up spreadsheets — only, in the end, to go with his heart. I did no such thing. I went for JPMorgan and later for the FT because they were the only companies offering me a job. It seemed a great reason to pick them then. It is still a great reason today.

P&G spends $36M on West Chester property Bowdeya Tweh , btweh@enquirer.com 11:32 a.m. EDT August 8, 2016 Procter & Gamble logo (Photo: Provided/P&G) After two purchases in early July, Procter & Gamble went from landlord to owner of its research and development facilities in West Chester Township. The Downtown Cincinnati-based consumer products giant spent $36.2 million to buy land and buildings at 8256 Union Centre Blvd. and 8611 Beckett Road. The property is home to P&G's Beckett Ridge Technical Center, which sits on more than 50 acres of land. Distribution Funding II, an entity owned by industrial real estate developer and property manager Prologis, sold the property to P&G. ​The purchases are among the largest in Butler County this year. The 25.7-acre Union Centre property cost more than $21 million and the 24.5-acre Beckett Road property cost nearly $15.2 million. The buildings on the campus feature more than 606,000 square feet of space and were built more than 17 years ago, according to the Butler County auditor's office.  Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/2b8zyCg TOP VIDEOS Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 22 17:46 Joe Deters asks for retrial of Ray Tensing, seeks change of venue 3:07 Black Friday secrets the stores don't want you to know 1:01 Finding home: A 12-year-old boy's search in the midst of war 6:41 Bills-Bengals postgame wrap 3:10 Bengals vs. Bills Week 11 predictions 6:02 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 15. 20:46 Supermoon rises over Cincinnati 0:55 Bengals vs. Giants wrap-up 3:15 The day Ray Tensing's murder case was declared a mistrial: 'The world was watching Cincinnati' 3:46 DuBose family reacts to news of mistrial 1:35 Tensing jury submits a question: Define 'arrest' 2:08 DuBose Fiancée still feels 'confident that a murder conviction will come' 0:48 Tensing jury can't agree on verdict, judge orders more deliberation 2:39 Bengals vs. Giants Week 10 Prediction 4:59 Cincinnati.com Prep Sports 360 for Nov. 8 18:29 Jeff Ruby: 'I sense there is not going to be justice' for the DuBose family 2:18 Deters on Tensing crying on the stand: ‘The place to be upset... was after you just blew someone's brains out' 26:55 Defense makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 41:26 Prosecution makes its closing arguments in the Tensing Trial 26:35 Tensing: 'Oh my God, he's going to run me over, he's going to kill me' 12:03 Use-of-force expert: 'The actions of Ray Tensing were justified' 0:50 Which stores are opening, closing Thanksgiving Day 0:34 \u0022I can't wait to see Tensing on the stand\u0022 0:55 Cincinnati Police Criminalist: Tensing 'seemed nervous or afraid' 2:59

(Getty) Although Olympic athletes aren’t paid for their participation in the games, strong performances in the global spotlight can often lead to lucrative sponsorship deals, and business opportunities. Michael Phelps is the most decorated Olympian of all time as he competes in his final games in Rio. The American swimmer now has a record 25 medals. Twenty-one of them are gold. Here’s what you need to know about Phelps’ net worth, endorsements, and charitable foundation. 1.

He Has Earned an Estimated $1.8 Million From Swimming Medals Michael Phelps competes in the butterfly leg of the Men’s 4×100 Medley Relay during the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. (Getty) American athletes winning medals at the Rio Olympic Games receive a cash prize from the U.S. Olympic Committee. The awards vary based on the medal won. Those awards are on top of the actual value of a “gold” medal – which is around $366 for the Rio games. The gold medal is a mixture of a small amount of 24-karat gold, some copper and a lot of sterling silver, according to Time. Phelps has earned a figure pegged around $1.8 million since 2001 from swimming medals, according to Money Nation. That’s equivalent to a salary of $113,000 per year. That number is based on $25,000 for each of the 18 Olympic gold medals Phelps has won, plus $15,000 for each of his two silvers and $10,000 for each of his two bronzes. That figure will go up by $75,000 as Phelps has won three gold medals as of Tuesday night in Rio. The estimate also takes into account the 37 gold medals, 11 silver medals and one bronze he has won in various National, World and Pan Pacific championships. While there are not exact figures on the cash awards for medals in those contests, Money Nation applied the Olympic payouts for an estimate. 4. He Earned $200,000 During the 2008 Olympic Games Phelps has won eight medals at the 2004 Athens Olympics, eight in Beijing in 2008 and six in London in 2012. (Getty) The 2008 Beijing games were monumentally successful for Phelps. His eight gold medals in the Beijing summer games earned him $200,000 from swimming medals. In 2012, he earned $130,000 in London with four gold, and two silver. 5. He Owns a 6,800-Square-Foot Home in Paradise Valley #tbt of my better half and I …. Love you!!! A photo posted by Michael Phelps (@m_phelps00) on Apr 21, 2016 at 7:04pm PDT Phelps recently purchased a 6,800-square-foot home in the upscale suburb of Paradise Valley in Phoenix, Arizona, according to USA Today. He lives there with his fiance Nicole Johnson, and their 3-month-old son. “Our backyard looks right at Camelback Mountain,” he told USA Today. “You go outside in our backyard and we have orange and tangerine and lemon and lime and peach and apple — all these different fruit trees growing in our backyard.” Phelps previously owned a Newport Beach Mansion in California. Although details on the property are scarce, it is believed to have cost at least $8 million, according to Gazette Review.

At the end of a 12-month period, the Complaints Panel will again commission an independent ground verification by a team of experts, following which a review of the complaint will be undertaken by the panel. Kenanga Investment Bank Bhd (Kenanga Research) was not surprised as it earlier noted that the required documents had been filed and was pending feedback. However, it forewarned that earnings recovery may not be immediately felt given loss of clients and  reputational damage. “While the news come as a positive boost to sentiment, we note that earnings recovery may not be felt immediately given the loss of major multi-national corporation (MNC) clients such as Unilever, P&G, and Cargill, among others,” it said in a note. “We believe full client recovery may take time, while new MNC clients could be dissuaded given reputation damage suffered from the suspension. “However, earnings from mid-1Q17 should see improvement with the recovery of certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO) premiums. RHB Research Institute Sdn Bhd (RHB Research) similarly believed a full reversal of negative impact to bottom line may take some time. The lifting of the RSPO suspension from August 8 means that there would be a five month impact on IOI’s earnings. “While this would have an immediate positive impact on earnings for the upstream division – as IOI would be able to sell its CSPO again – the impact to the downstream division may take a longer time. “This is due to the fact that downstream customers, who have already severed contracts with IOI may have already found other suppliers, or may take a longer time to trust IOI again.” RHB Research further said the verification processes conducted by the downstream customers to ensure that the sustainability criteria is met may take a longer time. “This could result in IOI not being able to regain this portion of its downstream business for a few additional months,” it added. Nevertheless, MIDF Amanah Investment Bank Bhd (MIDF Research) said the faster than expected uplift of suspension is positive for IOI’s share price. “The uplift is not a surprise as we have written in our June report that we believe that IOI suspension may be lifted in in less than a year given its proactive stance. “However, the speed of the uplift has surprised us. All in, the suspension has been ongoing for only less than five months.” What do you think of this story?

Home In Corporate March to Clean Energy, Utilities Not Required Instead of waiting for large utilities to go greener, companies are buying renewable energy directly, upending the traditional system. By Jan Ellen Spiegel, InsideClimate News Aug 8, 2016 Google is one of the companies leading the trend toward direct corporate purchase of clean energy through power purchase agreements. Credit: Getty Images A curious thing happened while U.S. utilities were focusing on cheap fracked gas, expensive nuclear power, what to do about coal, and how to fight  renewable energy models that threatened their bottom line. Some of the nation's largest corporations decided not to wait for utilities and took their interest in renewable energy into their own hands. They bought their own clean power. And they bought it directly from the companies that produced it. No utility middleman needed. This clean power revolt, led by some of the biggest corporate energy consumers, is the latest threat to the power purchase and delivery system that's been in place since Thomas Edison invented it. Could this be what gets utilities' attention and forces them to consider clean energy as the future instead of the enemy? Will it ultimately lead to the greening of all of America's power? "It's a really interesting question and I don't know the answer," said Blaine Collison, managing director of marketing and strategic partnerships at Altenex, an energy management company that has orchestrated direct energy purchases for Microsoft, Home Depot, Walmart, Procter and Gamble, Yahoo, Bloomberg and 3M, among others. "What I do know is that we've got a very significant number of massive employers and drivers of American economic output that have said, 'Okay, we want renewables and we're not satisfied with the current options that are available to us. So we're going out into the market and getting renewables for ourselves.'" Many experts say there is more of this to come, and that utilities will not sit back and let this market pass them by. The trend was spearheaded by the elite of the Fortune 500, especially those companies with electricity-guzzling data centers and manufacturing operations such as Google, Amazon and Walmart. Most have climate change concerns and want to boost their green portfolio—their customers wanted that, too—and to make the cost of power more predictable. And so they turned to an old, basic energy project financing model: a power purchase agreement, commonly called a PPA. Traditionally, a utility agrees to buy power for a long time from a generator, giving the builder of an energy plant the stability to attract financing for its construction. The utility then resells power to its customers. But in PPA 2.0, big customers started asking independent renewable power developers to build the installations, usually off-site and sometimes not even in the same state. The companies  signed contracts to buy the electricity virtually for a decade or longer. The trend line has been startling in the last few years, with more than 3.2 gigawatts of corporate renewable deals in 2015—most of them PPAs. That's more than double the amount in 2014. Municipalities, universities, and other institutions are adopting the model. And the temporary renewal of tax credits for wind and solar at the end of last year makes now an ideal time to jump in. Credit: DAVID MCNEW/AFP/Getty Images The windfall has been biggest for the wind power industry. Wind vastly outstrips solar as the corporate PPA power of choice. For 2015 and the first part of this year, about 2,800 megawatts of wind power contracted for corporate PPAs to only a little more than 800 megawatts of solar, according to a Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) analysis. "The rise of corporate buyer demand is very exciting for the wind industry," said Hannah Hunt, senior analyst for American Wind Energy Association. She called it a complement to the increasing wind purchases by utilities themselves, which she said was being propelled by better technology and improved siting that has cut the cost of wind by two-thirds over the last six years. Hervé Touati, managing director of RMI, called the trend "a very strong signal and an indication of the role corporate buyers can play." Companies considering PPAs are generally seeking larger amounts of renewable power than they can get putting a solar system on their roof, at a rate that's lower than the prevailing cost of electricity, locked in for 15 to 25 years. Some utilities are getting the message and working with companies to arrange competitive terms. Google is one of the earliest and largest adopters. In the last six years the company has structured more than a dozen PPAs totaling nearly 1,900 megawatts as it tries to reach its goal of 100 percent renewable power. They include one announced late last year through Duke Energy for solar in North Carolina. Amazon, also looking to be 100 percent renewable, has contracted for power from several wind farms and a solar installation for nearly 550 megawatts. It structured a solar PPA in Virginia through Dominion. Credit: IKEA The ranks of PPA purchasers include Walmart, Equinix, Microsoft and IKEA to round out the top half-dozen. General Motors is a recent addition. In 2011, GM set a goal of 125 megawatts of renewable energy by 2020. Twenty-two solar, three landfill gas, one waste-to-energy and one hydro installation later, the company is now at 106 megawatts. The largest solar system is just under 12 megawatts. "Even if we put up solar and covered the entire rooftop of our assembly plant, I'd maybe get 20 or 30 percent of our full load," said Rob Threlkeld, GM's global manager of renewable energy. "That's why we started to look at PPAs." Last year GM announced two wind PPAs—one 34-megawatt for several manufacturing facilities in Mexico, another 30-megawatt for an assembly plant in Texas. When the Mexico PPA goes online in a couple of months, it will put GM over its renewable goal four years early. Each plant will save the company $2 million annually for the life of the contract. Experts expect much more is coming, and soon. A survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in conjunction with the American Council for Renewable Energy (ACORE), which has also studied the corporate PPA phenomenon, sampled U.S.-headquartered companies with large energy footprints. Seventy-two percent of respondents said they were actively pursuing renewable energy purchases, mainly PPAs. So far, only 18 Fortune 500 firms have signed renewable PPAs, plus another 10 or so other companies. Last year's jump in contracts was partly attributable to uncertainty over the expiring tax credits. That sent many companies scrambling to lock in projects before the Dec. 31 deadline. The credits were extended for five years, driving the 2016 corporate renewable PPA pace below 2015. Experts said companies felt they could take a little more time with their decisions now. While the renewed tax breaks will clearly help, according to many people, the key driver behind PPA decisions was sustainability, not money. Many companies now have sustainability and renewable energy goals. And more and more investors, partners, stockholders and customers expect a company to address sustainability and climate change. "I don't believe that large corporations are leading this," said RMI's Touati. "I believe that customers are leading this." Either way, the price increasingly is right. "You don't have to use your own capital," noted George Favaloro, managing director for sustainable business solutions and head of the corporate energy transformation practice at PriceWaterhouse. He was the lead author of its survey. PPAs also avoid energy market price volatility. They lower energy costs. They don't require a company to have a large amount of land. But corporate PPAs do have shortcomings and risks. "The biggest risk is long-term contracts," GM's Threlkeld said. "What's the market going to look like in 10 to 15 years? What's our manufacturing presence in that state or country going look like in 10 to 15 years?" The trend also presents complex questions for the utilities. In Las Vegas, two major hotels—MGM and Wynn Resorts—have said they will pay hefty fees to leave the local utility, NV Energy, so they can buy renewable power. That was after they were unable to work out renewable deals with the utility. Such situations could portend even larger economic ramifications said Greg Wetstone, president of ACORE. "We may have companies saying, 'Look we don't want to come to your state if you're structured in a way that we can't buy the power we want,'" he said. "That's a very compelling economic message." Utilities appear to be listening. "Frankly I haven't heard any worry at all . I've heard more enthusiasm than anything," said Phil Moeller, vice president for energy delivery and chief customer solutions officer at the Edison Electric Institute, the trade association for investor-owned utilities. "The typical issues related to it from a utility's perspective —perhaps you have to include some balancing capability if it's just one fuel, and that fuel isn't available all the time. "That's really not a high hurdle."   Collison of Altenex said there are broader considerations, beyond any one utility. "It's a really interesting intersection of a market opportunity and a set of outcomes that has huge net benefits for the developer, for the power user, for climate change," he said. "This is about changing the U.S. generation portfolio. "It's pretty neat to see the corporates say 'look we want it and we're not waiting.'"

On BSE, 1,460 shares rose and 880 shares fell. A total of 105 shares were unchanged. The BSE Mid-Cap index was currently up 0.67%. The BSE Small-Cap index was currently up 0.66%. Both these indices outperformed the Sensex. In overseas stock markets, Asia markets were trading higher with sentiment underpinned by a stronger-than-expected US jobs report released on Friday, 5 August 2016. The US economy is the world's largest economy. Japanese stocks edged higher as the yen weakened amid the dollar's broad strength driven up upbeat job data. The Nikkei 225 index was currently up 2.23%. Chinese shares shrugged off weak trade data. In mainland China, the Shanghai Composite was currently up 0.44%. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index was currently up 1.25%. China's exports continued to fall in dollar terms in July 2016 from a year earlier, as global demand for goods from the world's second-largest economy remained sluggish. Exports slid 4.4% in July 2016 from a year earlier, following a decline of 4.8% in June 2016. Imports fell 12.5% in July 2016, compared with an 8.4% decrease in June 2016. US stocks edged higher during the previous trading session on Friday, 5 August 2016, with the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite index settling at all-time closing highs, after a stronger-than-expected jobs report. The US economy added 255,000 jobs in July 2016, which follows a stellar gain in June, demonstrating that the economy is still healthy, despite relatively muted gross domestic product. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.9% even as the labor-force participation rate edged up to 62.8%, suggesting the labor market is tightening. FMCG stocks were mixed. Britannia Industries (up 1.78%), Hindustan Unilever (up 0.5%), Marico (up 2.64%), Procter & Gamble Hygiene and Health Care (up 2.81%) and Bajaj Corp (up 0.39%) rose.

Parsvnath Developers (down 1.67%), Sobha (down 0.93%), Godrej Properties (down 0.19%) fell. HPCL gained after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raise the ceiling on investment in the company's equity capital by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) to 40% from 24%. The stock was up 3.01% at Rs 1,294.90. The stock hit a high of Rs 1,298.90 so far during the day, which is a record high for the counter. The stock hit a low of Rs 1,270.90 so far during the day. The RBI raised the ceiling on investment by FIIs in HPCL after approval for the proposal from the company's board of directors and shareholders. Meanwhile, the amendments made by Rajya Sabha in the constitutional amendment bill on Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be taken up for its passage by the Lok Sabha this week. The amended GST constitutional amendment bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha last week. The passage of the constitutional amendment bill in the Rajya Sabha kicks off a legislative marathon in which the Parliament and state assemblies will need to pass further laws setting the rate and scope of the GST. The government plans to implement the nationwide GST from 1 April 2017. The main objective of the GST is to eliminate excessive taxation. GST is a uniform indirect tax levied on goods and services across a country. The measure would harmonize 11 state and central levies into a national sales tax, reducing business transaction costs. On the macro front, the government in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has notified consumer price inflation target of 4% with upper tolerance level of 6% and lower tolerance level of 2% to be achieved by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The government notified the inflation target range of 2% to 6% in the Official Gazette on Friday, 5 August 2016 and it will be valid until 31 March 2021. The inflation target is to be fixed by the central government in consultation with the RBI once in every five years. According a statement from to the finance ministry, the key advantage of a range around a target is that it allows the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to recognise the short run trade-offs between inflation and growth but enables it to pursue the inflation target in long run over the course of business cycle. The range also accommodates data limitations, projection errors, short-run supply gaps and instability in the agriculture production, an important factor for CPI inflation, as food articles have a major weight in the CPI indices. It also allows to accommodate unanticipated short-term shocks even while nudging public inflation expectations on the centre of the range, to which the monetary policy will return the economy over the medium term, leading to transparency and predictability. If the average inflation is more than the upper tolerance level of 4% + 2%, that is, 6%, or less than the lower tolerance level of 4% - 2%, that is 2%, for any three consecutive quarters, it would mean a failure to achieve the inflation target. Where RBI fails to meet the inflation target, in terms of the provisions of RBI Act, it shall set out a report to the Central Government stating the reasons for failure to achieve the inflation target, remedial actions proposed to be taken by RBI and an estimate of the time-period within which the inflation target shall be achieved pursuant to timely implementation of proposed remedial actions. The government has initiated the process of shifting to a framework of Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) for deciding interest rates. RBI currently sets the rates. The RBI is set to announce monetary policy decision at 11:00 IST tomorrow, 9 August 2016, after a policy review.

The RBI raised the ceiling on investment by FIIs in HPCL after approval for the proposal from the company's board of directors and shareholders. Meanwhile, the amendments made by Rajya Sabha in the constitutional amendment bill on Goods and Services Tax (GST) will be taken up for its passage by the Lok Sabha this week. The amended GST constitutional amendment bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha last week. The passage of the constitutional amendment bill in the Rajya Sabha kicks off a legislative marathon in which both the central and state governments will need to pass further laws setting the rate and scope of the GST. The government plans to implement the nationwide GST from 1 April 2017. The main objective of the GST is to eliminate excessive taxation. GST is a uniform indirect tax levied on goods and services across a country. The measure would harmonize 11 state and central levies into a national sales tax, reducing business transaction costs. On the macro front, the government in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has notified consumer price inflation target of 4% with upper tolerance level of 6% and lower tolerance level of 2% to be achieved by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The government has initiated the process of shifting to a framework of Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) for deciding interest rates. RBI currently sets the rates. The RBI is set to announce monetary policy decision at 11:00 IST tomorrow, 9 August 2016, after a policy review.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 8 August 2016 | MYT 11:22 AM PIVB Research ups IOI Corp target price to RM4.78 KUALA LUMPUR: PublicInvest Research (PIVB) Research has raised the 12 month target price for IOI Corporation Bhd to RM4.78 from RM4.55 after the Roundable of Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) lifted the suspension from Monday after four months.  “We welcome the decision, however, it is going to take time for IOI Corp to recover lost customer base. Nevertheless, we expect its earnings to gradually improve going forward,” it said on Monday. The research house said with the withdrawal of RSPO membership suspension, it adjusted its earnings forecasts to the pre-suspension level. This will see its sum-of-part based target price enhanced from RM4.55 to RM4.78. Maintain Neutral call. IOI Corp’s RSPO membership was suspended on March 28 due to non-compliance with some of RSPO’s rules on possessing environment permits and clearing of fragile land in Indonesia’s West Kalimantan province.  Following that, its major customers, namely, Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive, Hershey’s, Johnson & Johnson, Kellogg, Mars, Nestle, SC Johson, Yum! Brands, Procter & Gamble and Rectitt Benckiser have stopped sourcing palm oil products from IOI Corp’s subsidiary, IOI Loders Croklaan and switched their suppliers to counterparts like KLK, Sime Darby and Wilmar.  “This resulted in monetary losses like CSPO premium and customer base. Other non-monetary losses include reputation. “IOI Corp reported total fresh fruit bunches (FFB) production of 3.14 million tonnes of FFB, which accounted for 97% of our full-year forecasts. The 4Q production had the steepest decline due to the strong El Nino’s impact. Nevertheless, we expect production growth to turn positive in the 2H 2016 as June production’s decline has softened significantly. “IOI Corp is expected to announce its 4QFY16 results on 23 Aug. We think the results may be dragged by weaker FFB production and FX translation loss as our Ringgit weakened 3.8995 to 4.0288 against the US dollar. 4Q suffered the steepest production drop, down 171,012mt or 19.2% YoY. “Reversing our earnings forecasts to the pre-suspension level. Following the withdrawal of suspension, we input higher earnings forecasts for FY17-19 with an increase of 3-5%.  “Although it will be a major challenge for the Group to win back its lost customers, we believe its strong profile coupled with its sizeable downstream capacity would help to re-establish its tainted value chain in the medium term,” it said.

David © Provided by CNBC The shave is proving harder to kill than John McClane in "Die Hard." Quotes in the article Procter & Gamble Co PG ▼ 82.59 -0.17 -0.21% Less than two years ago, the growing ubiquity of hirsute men — and the resulting decline in razor blade sales — led The Washington Post to make a dramatic declaration that beards were "killing the shaving industry." Indeed, even Gillette parent Procter & Gamble (PG) groused that the beard trend was detrimental to sales, which at the time were down double digits. What a difference a year makes. Despite beards being as popular as ever, discount razor blade sales are on the rise — which suggests shaving is learning to coexist happily with the boom in facial hair. In fact, Internet businesses that cater to beard grooming have mushroomed concomitantly in the last few years with web sales of razors. "The manual shaving category grew by 101 percent over the past two years, which all brands have benefited from," Taylor Stanton, marketing & communications Manager at Slice Intelligence told CNBC in response to an emailed inquiry. "The online channel has also made it possible for new players like Bevel to emerge and offer shaving products to those who have been underserved by the typical selection at the local grocery store or big box retailer," Stanton added. Recent data suggest shavers are moving to blades sold online — which are far cheaper than premium brands sold by Schick and Gillette. Surging blade sales on the web recently led the latter to start its own online club, while Unilever recently moved to buy start-up Dollar Shave Club for an estimated $1 billion. "Analyzing the online market share of shaving companies doesn't tell the full story. The shave clubs, lead by Dollar Shave Club, completely changed how consumers buy razors," Stanton told CNBC. In a new research report, Slice Intelligence said that with the Dollar Shave acquisition, competitor Harry's "is the razor company to watch." The shaving upstart is actually growing faster year over year than Dollar Shave, Slice says, and is the third-largest shaving brand in the U.S. behind Dollar Shave and Gillette. The latter two comprised "three-quarters of all sales last year. Still, given Harry's high growth rate, it's already made a successful sortie on Gillette, Dorco and Schick's market share," Slice's analysts wrote in a new report on the breakneck growth of online shaving clubs. In an April survey, research firm Euromonitor called internet sales of razor blades "the most important story in men's grooming," estimating that web sales hit $342 million last year — the overwhelming bulk of which were razor and blade sales. However, Slice's research may explain in part why online razor sales have hit a crescendo — many women are also getting in on the action. The firm's data showed that 39 percent of internet buyers of shaving products were women in June, a 7 percent rise since last year. "Currently Dollar Shave Club is the primary brand marketing to women," Slice's analysts wrote. "Their messaging seems to be working as 57 percent of Shave Club's revenue growth has been driven by female buyers since the start of 2015." Dollar Shave is clearly ruling the roost, with Euromonitor data showing the company's $153 million in sales is the clear market leader. Slice's research confirmed Dollar Shave's dominance, but noted that Harry's customers spend more per order ($17 per purchase) than Dollar Shave clients ($7 per purchase). The deep-pocketed patrons of Bevel, another shaving start-up, spend nearly $50 per order, Slice's data found. According to Euromonitor, there's plenty of room for growth, with fewer than 5 percent of U.S. men belonging to an online shaving club. That said, Gillette's foray into the lucrative area is a big wild card, and the growing number of competitors may make it more challenging for Dollar Shave and Harry's. "The nature of this category is changing as both of the leading shave clubs start to increasingly focus on nonshaving products and the benefits of frequently switching razors instead of seeking to compete primarily through low price," the firm added.

In a deal that has shaken the stodgy consumer products industry, Unilever announced last week it will pay $1 billion to acquire Dollar Shave Club, a scrappy five-year-old firm that delivers no-frills disposable blades to subscribers for as little as $3 per month. Since launching in 2011, the Venice, California–based startup has grown to 3.2 million subscribers — earning $152 million in revenue last year and becoming a case study in how a disruptive innovator can "break into a highly profitable and overserved industry." The global razor business has long been built on convincing people they need more and more blinged-out blades at higher and higher prices, said Sharon Terlep at The Wall Street Journal. Dollar Shave Club's "simple, low-price razors have upended" that model. The startup now claims 5 percent of the U.S. men's shaving market, long dominated by the colossus Gillette, a property of Unilever rival Procter & Gamble. Since 2010, Gillette's market share has fallen from 71 percent to 59 percent. Dollar Shave Club's success "shows that no company is safe from the creative destruction brought by technological change," said Steven Davidoff Solomon at The New York Times. Once upon a time, challenging a market leader like Gillette would have required factories, sophisticated distribution, an enormous and experienced sales force, and a TV-marketing blitz. "But the internet, mass transportation, and globalization destroy everything." Dollar Shave Club doesn't actually make any of its products; it contracts with a South Korean razor manufacturer and then sells the blades directly to consumers over the web, bypassing retail middlemen. Because of this lean approach, Dollar Shave Club has just 190 employees. Thanks to YouTube, its initial advertising was essentially free. The company's first irreverent viral video, promising "f—ing great" razors at affordable prices, was responsible for 12,000 orders within 24 hours. Since then, the video has been seen more than 20 million times. When startups can get free advertising through YouTube, easy distribution through the mail, and low-cost sales via the web, "every other company should be afraid, very afraid." Consumers are the clear winners of this brave new business model, said Farhad Manjoo, also at The New York Times. Just as Dollar Shave Club has made buying razors cheap and convenient, Warby Parker has done the same for eyeglasses, Casper for mattresses, and Primary for kids' clothes. "By cutting out the inefficiencies of retail space and the marketing expense of TV, these companies can offer better products at lower prices." And because brands born online live and die by their reputation, their customer service is fast and friendly. Small wonder then that Unilever is eager to "buy its way in," said Catherine Piner at Slate. P&G is also playing catch-up with its own Gillette Shave Club, and has launched the Tide Wash Club, which sends consumers detergent refills for a monthly fee. Both firms are eyeing Amazon, which aspires to provide regular deliveries of everything from diapers to groceries through its "subscribe and save" program. The future of retail is coming, and it's arriving via the mail. Try 4 Risk-Free Issues of The Week magazine. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT SHARE!   Try 4 Risk-Free Issues of The Week magazine.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Olympics marketers go for the gold Sunday Aug 7, 2016 at 2:01 AM By Mae AndersonThe Associated Press NEW YORK — Prepare to be inspired. After all, it's Olympic ad time. Olympics marketers from Coca-Cola to Samsung are pulling out all the stops this summer, stuffing scores of athletes into ads and telling tearjerker stories. Coke's ads play on "gold" moments when athletes have a Coke together. An ad for Samsung shows the road to Rio for a runner from South Sudan, the newest country to be recognized by the International Olympic Committee. A Visa ad , customized for different countries around the world, shows a bevy of athletes carpooling to Rio. And P&G continues its "Thank You Mom" campaign with ads focused on how mothers have helped Olympic athletes along the way. SPONSOR CHALLENGES The rah-rah campaigns mask an unsettling truth: It's tough out there for an Olympic marketer. The games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, face a number of big problems ranging from the Zika virus to political upheaval . So companies are opting for campaigns that aim to capitalize on the emotional appeal of the Olympics without lingering too heavily on the specifics of Rio or Brazil. There's an additional challenge. A new rule allows non-sponsors — that is, companies who haven't paid the International Olympic Committee for the privilege of using Olympic trademarks in their ads and other perks — to make greater use of Olympic athletes in ads. All that means a lot of risk, given that sponsoring the Olympics costs about $100 million to $200 million over four years. But that hefty price tag has a reward, too: an estimated 20 million viewers every evening on NBC over the three week stretch of the Olympics. MORE COMPETITION  To protect that major investment by sponsors, the Olympic committee long prohibited anyone but sponsors from using Olympic athletes or Olympic rings or logos in ads. But the age of social media made enforcement increasingly difficult, so this year the rules have relaxed. Advertisers could apply in January to use Olympic athletes in their ads, though they were required to start their campaigns in March and still couldn't use official Olympic terminology or logos. Under Armor has been the most high-profile brand to make use of the looser restrictions, and features swimmer Michael Phelps and other Olympians in ads. Others, including General Mills, Gatorade and Asics, have also applied to advertise under the looser regulation, known as Rule 40. "Rule 40 is changing the landscape. More advertisers are able to use the Olympics, so sponsors are trying different approaches to stand out," said Villanova marketing professor Charles Taylor. ATHLETES APLENTY  One way they're doing so is by featuring more athletes in their ads. Coke's campaign features 79 athletes from 23 countries, including new footage of 24 athletes such as U.S. swimmer Nathan Adrian and Australian hurdler Michelle Jennek. The teen-targeted ads show athletes on and off the field sharing a Coke and having memorable moments like a stolen kiss, dubbed "Gold moments." "The campaign idea is 'Gold' is a feeling anyone can taste," said Rodolfo Echeverria, a Coca-Cola vice president in charge of advertising. Visa's "The Carpool to Rio" campaign features 15 athletes, including New Zealand shot putter Valerie Adams and U.S. swimmer Missy Franklin. The ad shows off Visa payment technology, such as its mobile app and another swiping a credit card at an automated entrance gate to pay for a ferry. The ad, which is airing in 38 countries, was adapted for 14 different markets by using athletes and styles of payments specific to particular locales. "It's very much anchored in all the different things Visa can do," said Chris Curtin, Visa's brand marketing officer.  That multi-athlete strategy lets Olympic marketers avoid the problems that can occur if they bank too heavily on individual athletes. In the most infamous case, then-Olympic sponsor Reebok made little known decathletes Dan O'Brien and Dave Johnson into household names leading up to the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. Posing the question, "Who will be the world's greatest athlete, Dan or Dave?," the campaign had to be modified after O'Brien failed to qualify for the games. GET OUT YOUR HANKIES Of course, it's always possible just to focus more on athletes' inspirational and tearjerker stories than their Olympic achievement. Samsung's "Chant" ad showcases Margret Rumat Rumar Hassan, a 19 year old runner from South Sudan. The ad shows the South Sudanese, a new country in the Olympics, chanting her name and cheering her on. The tagline is "Proud sponsor of those who defy barriers."  "This Olympics the focus is on telling human stories ... the technology doesn't take center stage," said Pio Schunker, Samsung's global head of marketing.  And P&G is continuing its crowdpleasing "Thank You Mom" ads with the tagline "Proud sponsor of moms" that started running in 2010. One of the latest showcases U.S. gymnast Simone Biles and her adoptive mother; it's already garnered more than 2 million views on YouTube.

Simone Biles competes on the floor exercise during the women's qualifications in Rio.

At this confession, her four teammates dissolved into giggles of agreement. “Um, in the back, I thought I was gonna die,” Simone Biles admitted. “Yes!” Raisman replied. “In the bathroom, when me and you were in the bathroom, I asked you, ‘Are you okay?’” Raisman paused. “And I was like, ‘Me neither.’” At that point the gathered women began sharing their nerves-before-competition stories, talking over each other with giddy mentions of the shaking hands and near-vom experiences that came when they finally—finally—found themselves on the Olympic stage. “We just sat there,” Biles said, recalling those tense pre-competition moments, “and we were like”—and then the three-time all-around world champion, the woman an NBC commentator referred to earlier in the evening as “the greatest of all time,” made a dramatic shruggie gesture. In response to which: Her team giggled some more. Related Story The Weird Athleticism of the Victoria's Secret Model NBC’s roving cameras caught that off-stage exchange—superhumans, acting in a decidedly human fashion—after the five women had clinched the U.S.’s spot to compete for team gold in Rio. But the athletes (also known as “Team USA,” the “Fierce Five: Redux,” and “The Most Dominant U.S. Gymnastics Team Ever Assembled”) didn’t merely secure the team’s place in the finals, and they didn’t merely come away with a first-place ranking heading into the competition that will determine who wins medals. Instead, they smashed through the high expectations set for them. And yet here they were, after their big, if unsurprising, victory, commiserating and confessing and laughing and acting, in the end, like exactly what they are: a group of young—very young—women. Women’s gymnastics is traditionally one of the most-watched events of the summer Games—much more popular than its masculine counterpart, which features similar feats of super-human strength and skill. (The rings! THE RINGS.) That’s in part because women’s gymnastics is, as entertainment, riveting—the balance beam alone is basically a 4-inch-thick hunk of Hitchcock—but it is also, likely, because the sport presents collisions of a more cultural strain. Here are young women, bedecked of bow and bedazzled of leotard, flexing and flipping and generally giving a massive side-eye to gravity itself. Here are the performance of sport and the performance of femininity, united in a singular, if extremely precarious, harmony. The team’s leos will feature nearly 5,000 crystals in designs that evoke shooting stars and swirling clouds. In that sense, women’s gymnastics captivates because it insinuates: The sport serves, on top of everything else, as a metaphor for a cultural moment that is appending notions of strength (and not just “moral strength”) to womanhood. It exemplifies the tensions of a time that is newly distinguishing between the female and the feminine. It’s a sport, too, with an undeniably political edge: Women’s gymnastics, like this particular moment in feminism, pays lip service to ideals of “empowerment,” but its workings are underscored by the knowledge that years’ worth of effort can, through gravity’s apathy, be undone in a single instant. Sweaty and sparkly, muscular and girly, explosive and controlled: Gymnastics is the successful execution of many different balancing acts. * * * Women’s gymnastics, in its current form, owes a lot both to second-wave feminism and to Title IX—which brought about the general de-dainty-ization of the traditionally balletic sport. (“Before the 1970s,” the essayist Meghan O’Rourke points out, “women’s gymnastics had been snoozy and staid, resembling, as a Sports Illustrated writer put it, ‘a lyrical exercise somewhere this side of ballet.’”) A recent change in the sport’s scoring system, which took away the long-standing cap of 10, allowed for ever-upward difficulty levels in routines, which in turn further emphasized feat-affording strength among its athletes. It may have preserved its official name—“artistic gymnastics”—amid all these changes, but the sport’s champions ascend by embracing moves that are traditionally not “ladylike”: leaping, grasping, thudding, punching the air after a stuck landing. Gymnastics is determinedly unladylike in another way, too: It is for the most part practiced, at the elite levels, only by very young women (the current U.S. team ranges in age from 16 to 22). This is emphasized in an aesthetic that borrows heavily from what you might call “pageant chic.” Team USA is known, in particular, for its bedazzled competition uniforms, and each Olympics has brought with it leotards that are more crystal-encrusted—with Swarovski versions, as “they have the most shine and sparkle”—than the last. (Given how much of a “typical” adolescence elite gymnasts are made to sacrifice in their athletic pursuits, it’s at this point a cliche of the sport to talk about their sparkling competition leotards as their “prom dresses.”) This year, The New York Times reports, the women’s leos will feature nearly 5,000 individual crystals—in designs that evoke shooting stars and swirling clouds and the other stuff of dreams fulfilled. Stories from the games in Rio Read more Dramatic makeup, too, is a mainstay of the gymnastics floor—Biles, last night, wore sparkling eyeliner that mimicked the swooping lines of the team leo—as are manicured fingers and pedicured toes. (This is perhaps because USA Gymnastics stipulates, without a bit of irony, that each athlete competing under its auspices must be “well groomed in her appearance.”) On Sunday, NBC’s omniscient camera caught Madison Kocian, the 19-year-old whose specialty is the uneven bars, kneeling on the floor after having executed a nearly perfect routine. She was zipping her chalk-covered grips into a hot-pink makeup bag. It’s not only gymnasts, of course, who embrace their femininity on the field of play. Hair ribbons are a mainstay of women’s softball. Brandi Chastain celebrated her scoring of the U.S. women’s soccer team’s game-winning penalty shot against China by taking off her shirt to reveal her sports bra. Flo-Jo was known for her elaborate manicures, and in her spirit, this time around, come—among others—the French basketball player Emmeline Ndongue, who wears patriotic stripes on her nails, and the American volleyball player Destinee Hooker, whose manicure sports the union flag and the Olympic rings. Procter & Gamble went so far as to set up a nail salon in the Olympic village so that athletes—presumably women—might similarly bedazzle themselves. Women’s gymnastics, though, is notable for something beyond its athletes’ embrace of their femininity: its simultaneous embarrassment about their femaleness. Women gymnasts have come to resemble swimmers in their uniform lack of body hair—waxing being an unspoken mandate that has as much to do with aesthetics as with aerodynamics. (Well groomed in her appearance.) The gymnasts’ outfits, too, their snazzy sparkles notwithstanding, suggest a certain abashedness about the female form: Judges are free to deduct points for underwear that peeks out from beyond the athletes’ leos. It’s a sartorial awkwardness that reflects a more systemic one. In gymnastics, the body fat that is a typical signal of healthy womanhood is stubbornly burned off. The development of breasts has curtailed otherwise promising careers. The rigors of training—coupled with eating disorders that have been known to afflict its athletes—can delay menstruation. Women’s gymnastics, on the whole, may celebrate its eponymous “women”; it is also, however, decidedly ambivalent about them. Many of its workings suggest a preference to see those women, whatever their age and achievement, as girls. USA Gymnastics stipulates, without a hint of irony, that each athlete must be “well groomed in her appearance.” And then, of course, there are allegations of sexual abuse that have long cast a shadow over the sport. Joan Ryan’s 1995 book, Little Girls in Pretty Boxes, told stories not just of bullying young athletes have endured at the hands of their coaches, but of abuse. USA Gymnastics banned Don Peters, the coach of the 1984 Olympic team, from the sport after several of the athletes he’d trained made accusations against him—but it didn’t do so until 2011. Last week, the IndyStar released the results of a lengthy investigation into the matter, concluding that USAG has “turned a blind eye to sex abuse.” The tension, across the sport’s elite levels—a dynamic of fragility and strength, of empowerment and its opposite—has escalated to such a degree that some critics have wondered whether watching women’s gymnastics is, at this point, unethical. One of those wonderings, however, accompanied its text—ironically, or perhaps fittingly, and either way revealingly—with artistic photographs of Olympian and other elite gymnasts that emphasized not just the athletes’ muscles, but also their manicures and hairdos and, in a couple of cases, their crotches. * * * In that, gymnastics is an extreme reflection of a widespread cultural ambivalence—about youth in general, perhaps, but about girlhood in particular. On the one hand, “empowerment” is the ethic of the moment, via toys and clothes and media messaging that seek to downplay gender as a factor in a young person’s life. NBC, on Sunday, featured a bio package with Gabby Douglas, one of the stars who emerged from the London Games (and the other gymnast—with Raisman—who is representing the U.S., in 2016, for her second Olympics). Douglas, in an interview, cited Serena Williams as one of her role models, and her explanation reflected the feminist messaging of the moment. “She’s just so dominant,” the star gymnast said of the tennis star, “and she just goes after what she wants, and she’s just so aggressive. I love strong, empowered women.” Gymnastics, even more than other sports, emphasizes the challenges gravity-bound women must navigate. In the same series of Better Know an Athlete packages, though, NBC emphasized, for Simone Biles, not her dominance or her aggression, but instead her … girly femininity. Biles’s short documentary featured footage of the young athlete grinning at the camera while getting a manicure (and requesting that her nails be done in patriotic red and blue). The young champion, Bob Costas intoned, “in any other context might seem like any other teenager”—and his thesis was proven, again and again. “She loves girly stuff,” Biles’s mother shared in an interview for the package, “so she loves to shop and she loves to get her hair done, her nails done. She likes to feel pretty.” Her father, in a separate interview, agreed: “She’s a teenager. A typical female teenager.” These mini-movies will always, across sports and across Games, engage in a kind of doubling: Their point is to emphasize the ordinariness of athletes who have chosen lives that are, by definition, anything but ordinary—and to make those athletes relatable, as such, to their couch-sitting audiences. They will always revel in the banality of greatness, and vice versa. But what Sunday’s treatments of the U.S. Olympic team did was to suggest another kind of paradox, and another kind of relatability—one that has as much to do with the athletes’ gender as with their athleticism. This may be the age of women’s empowerment, the age of Serena Williams and Gabby Douglas and Simone Biles and Hillary Clinton; it is also, though, the age of Donald Trump and the wage gap and the tampon tax and the Bic for Her Fashion Retractable Ball Pen, manufactured in a lady-friendly pink. It is also the age that found the Chicago Tribune, on Sunday, announcing the fact that Corey Cogdell-Unrein had medaled for the U.S. in trap-shooting with the tweet, “Wife of a Bears’ lineman wins a bronze medal today in Rio Olympics.” So the political message of women’s gymnastics is on the one hand what the political message of any women’s sports will eventually be: It separates achievement, casually but also meaningfully, from aesthetics. Sports don’t care what a woman looks like, or whether she’s graceful, or whether she’s pleasing to anyone. They care only how high she jumped, how quickly she ran, how many goals she scored. And yet gymnastics comes with particular caveats about looks and behavior and “grace.” It carries standards, both stipulated and unspoken, about one’s comportment. It enforces, for all the strength it demands of its athletes, a certain daintiness. Its competitors, the sport seems to believe—no matter what else they achieve—had better look good while doing their achieving. In that sense gymnastics is, for better or for worse, much more in line than other sports are with the challenges that gravity-bound women face every day. An Under Armour ad that went viral in the lead-up to the Rio Games showed Madison Kocian training, with other women gymnasts, for her Olympics debut. The ad featured inspiring music. It featured the brand’s tagline of of-the-moment empowerment: “Rule yourself.” It featured scenes of the gymnast who is currently one of the best in the world sacrificing, striving, hurting, pushing … and getting her nails done.

President-Elect Donald Trump on Wednesday said he will nominate the Michigan philanthropist and prominent Republican donor Betsy DeVos to be U.S. Education Secretary. The announcement signals that big changes could be on the way for schools and students around the country. Here are five things to know: 1. DeVos will push for school choice DeVos has been a vocal supporter of school choice, which is something Trump backed on the campaign trail. DeVos, who heads up the pro-charter and pro-school-voucher nonprofit American Federation for Children, has said parents should have the ability to choose the best schools for their children, whether they are traditional public schools, charters, or private schools. Trump has proposed creating a $20 billion federal voucher program for families to use to send their kids to the school of their choice. But, as Education Week noted recently, making that program a reality could be difficult. It’s unclear exactly where the funding would come from, and even if Congress did manage to pass such a proposal, some states currently prohibit funds from going to schools with religious affiliations, which could complicate how those funds are used.

Spencer saluted more than 200 attendees on Saturday, gathered at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington, D.C., for the annual conference of the National Policy Institute, which describes itself as “an independent organization dedicated to the heritage, identity, and future of  people of European descent in the United States, and around the world.” Spencer has popularized the term “alt-right” to describe the movement he leads. Spencer has said his dream is “a new society, an ethno-state that would be a gathering point for all Europeans,” and has called for “peaceful ethnic cleansing.” For most of the day, a parade of speakers discussed their ideology in relatively anodyne terms, putting a presentable face on their agenda. But after dinner, when most journalists had already departed, Spencer rose and delivered a speech to his followers dripping with anti-Semitism, and leaving no doubt as to what he actually seeks. He referred to the mainstream media as “Lügenpresse,” a term he said he was borrowing from “the original German”; the Nazis used the word to attack their critics in the press.

Americans talk about democracy like it’s sacred. In public discourse, the more democratic American government is, the better. The people are supposed to rule. But that’s not the premise that underlies America’s political system. Most of the men who founded the United States feared unfettered majority rule. James Madison wrote in Federalist 10 that systems of government based upon “pure democracy … have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property.” John Adams wrote in 1814 that, “Democracy never lasts long. It soon wastes, exhausts and murders itself.” The framers constructed a system that had democratic features. The people had a voice. They could, for instance, directly elect members of the House of Representatives. But the founders also self-consciously limited the people’s voice.

But we also use it when we’re all alone; it shapes even our silent relationships with ourselves. In his book, The Voices Within, Charles Fernyhough gives a historical overview of “inner speech”—the more scientific term for “talking to yourself in your head.” Fernyhough, a professor at Durham University in the U.K., says that inner speech develops alongside social speech. This idea was pioneered by Lev Vygotsky, a Russian psychologist who studied children in the 1920s and noted that when they learned to talk to other humans, they also learned how to talk to themselves, first out loud, and eventually, in their heads. Continue Reading Yamada Taro / Getty What’s So Great About American World Leadership? Hugh White The U.S. voters who rejected decades of bipartisan foreign-policy consensus might be on to something. How has America come to elect a president who so starkly repudiated decades’ worth of the largely bipartisan vision of U.S. global leadership? And if that vision won’t be the basis of American foreign policy in the 21st century, what will replace it? The big message of 2016 is that large numbers of American voters, Democrat and Republican, do not buy what their political leaders have been selling for so long, and that includes foreign policy. The evidence of this from Trump’s victory is reinforced by Senator Bernie Sanders’ remarkable showing in the Democratic primaries, and by years’ worth of public-opinion surveys showing the widespread view that the United States “does too much in helping solve world problems.” It is also reinforced by the high poll numbers of an outgoing president who has mounted his own quiet campaign against key elements of Washington’s foreign-policy orthodoxy. Continue Reading Etienne Fabre / SSAC A Shocking Find In a Neanderthal Cave In France Ed Yong A rock structure, built deep underground, is one of the earliest hominin constructions ever found. In February 1990, thanks to a 15-year-old boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski, footsteps echoed through the chambers of Bruniquel Cave for the first time in tens of thousands of years. The cave sits in France’s scenic Aveyron Valley, but its entrance had long been sealed by an ancient rockslide. Kowalsczewski’s father had detected faint wisps of air emerging from the scree, and the boy spent three years clearing away the rubble. He eventually dug out a tight, thirty-meter-long passage that the thinnest members of the local caving club could squeeze through. They found themselves in a large, roomy corridor. There were animal bones and signs of bear activity, but nothing recent. The floor was pockmarked with pools of water. The walls were punctuated by stalactites (the ones that hang down) and stalagmites (the ones that stick up).

Trump. Estimates of Trump’s wealth vary substantially: While he self-reports a net worth of $10 billion, independent agencies have arrived at valuation generally between $3 billion and $5 billion. The unprecedented nature of Trump’s business interests, coupled with the many precedents that Trump broke throughout his campaign—not releasing his tax returns, for example, which severely limits attempts to understand his financial situation—has provoked speculation that his presidency may bring about equally unprecedented opportunities for conflicts of interest. Trump’s response—provided on Twitter—only reinforces concerns that he will make little effort to avoid entangling his business and personal interests, and will instead attack those who point that out. Continue Reading sketchblog/flickr Masters of Love Emily Esfahani Smith Science says lasting relationships come down to—you guessed it—kindness and generosity. Every day in June, the most popular wedding month of the year, about 13,000 American couples will say “I do,” committing to a lifelong relationship that will be full of friendship, joy, and love that will carry them forward to their final days on this earth. Except, of course, it doesn’t work out that way for most people. The majority of marriages fail, either ending in divorce and separation or devolving into bitterness and dysfunction. Of all the people who get married, only three in ten remain in healthy, happy marriages, as psychologist Ty Tashiro points out in his book The Science of Happily Ever After, which was published earlier this year. Social scientists first started studying marriages by observing them in action in the 1970s in response to a crisis: Married couples were divorcing at unprecedented rates. Worried about the impact these divorces would have on the children of the broken marriages, psychologists decided to cast their scientific net on couples, bringing them into the lab to observe them and determine what the ingredients of a healthy, lasting relationship were. Was each unhappy family unhappy in its own way, as Tolstoy claimed, or did the miserable marriages all share something toxic in common?

Here’s why the race between Governor Pat McCrory and Democrat Roy Cooper isn’t over yet. DURHAM, N.C.—It’s been two weeks since Election Day, which means that in 49 states, residents know who their governor will be next year. North Carolinians, however, are still waiting to see. At the end of balloting on November 8, Democrat Roy Cooper, the current state attorney general, had a lead of a few thousand votes over Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican. Cooper promptly declared victory, but McCrory has not conceded the race, and the state has not been able to declare a winner. On Monday, Cooper announced a transition team, while McCrory accused him of “circumventing the electoral process.” Cooper’s lead fluctuated throughout the day on Tuesday as more counties returned their final canvass, but as of writing it was a little more than 6,000 votes out of roughly 4,700,000.

In a split decision of sorts, a state parole board has denied Dempsey Hawkins, 56, parole in the United States, but said he could be conditionally paroled if he is shipped back to his native England by July, 2018. Hawkins is serving a sentence of 22 years to life for strangling Susan Jacobson to death on May 15, 1976. Hawkins was 16 then. According to the parole board, a final deportation order to the United Kingdom has been issued against Hawkins. A spokeswoman for the state Department of Corrections and Community said Monday that Hawkins remains incarcerated. She could not immediately say if arrangements have been made to deport him. Hawkins had been denied parole on nine prior occasions. In its decision, parole commissioners cited Hawkins'  good disciplinary record and the "numerous rehabilitative achievements," including a college-level education, he's attained while behind bars. But commissioners also found "troubling" Hawkins' "denial and deletion of, or failure to recall certain facts" about the crime during a recent interview three weeks ago. "In short, you still seem capable of deception regarding criminal thoughts and behavior. We find your deceit and actions in support of your deception to be aggravating factors," the board wrote. "Your actions exhibit a cruel deliberation and contempt that prompt us to find that your release in the United States would deprecate the seriousness of the crime as to undermine respect for the law," said the board. Still, commissioners said Hawkins has remained behind bars nearly 16 years beyond his minimum 22-year sentence and granted him conditional parole for deportation only. If deported, Hawkins is not to contact Ms. Jacobson's family and can't financially profit by telling his story. Janice Blanchard, a sister of the victim, said her family is not aware of the complete details of the parole board's ruling, and did not wish to comment on it. In a brief interview in April, Blanchard said Hawkins had shown no remorse for the crime. "Everyone deserves a second chance at life, but not when you don't own up to your mistakes,'' she said then, after a state appellate court ordered the parole board to consider Hawkins' age at the time of the murder.  In ordering a new hearing on the parole board's 2014 denial, the appellate court said the Eighth Amendment requires a juvenile offender's youth and "its attendant characteristics," be weighed by parole commissioners. Commissioners must consider whether the crime reflects, "transient immaturity." Hawkins' civil lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment. Prosecutors said Hawkins killed Ms. Jacobson during a quarrel in which she sought to end their relationship. Hawkins then hid her body in a 55-gallon oil barrel inside an underground bunker at the former Downey's Shipyard in Mariners Harbor. Ms. Jacobson's grieving family, whom Hawkins pretended to aid, searched relentlessly for her body for months. They even sought a nationally-known psychic's help. But her decomposed corpse wasn't recovered for nearly two years — and then, by chance. Three boys came across Ms. Jacobson's skeletal remains on March 25, 1978, as they were exploring in the area. A Feb. 21, 1979, Advance story described the site as a "bleak, desolate area," off Richmond Terrace, between Holland and Western avenues, near the former Procter & Gamble Co. plant. Neighborhood residents referred to the area as "Down-back." Afterward, Hawkins, a native of England, was arrested in Joppa, Ill. He had gone there in April, 1977, to live with his father, Advance records show. Prosecutors' star witness during the trial was Hawkins' cousin, Willie (Puckie) Hawkins. Willie Hawkins testified that his cousin, Dempsey, admitted to choking Ms. Jacobson to death with a shirt. At a re-hearing in June, in which the board reaffirmed its 2014 denial, Hawkins expressed regret for his actions and vowed to lead a crime-free life if released, according to a transcript. "I am remorseful for the crime," he said. "I am deeply, I'm terribly sorry. I wish I had never committed that crime . . . I will never in my life commit another crime. I will never harm another human being, and I mean that." Hawkins said he had been in touch with a vice consul in the United Kingdom, as well as a criminal justice organization there which could assist him with housing, employment and other services. He also said he could stay with relatives living outside of London. Despite the denial, Hawkins was eligible in July for another hearing for the year 2016. Inmates serving indeterminate sentences can apply for parole every two years. If Hawkins is not deported by July, 2018, he can reapply for parole then, the board said.

A bonus issue from the Fortune 500 company is also likely. While IOC itself seems to be in favour of a 1: 2 bonus, the Government, which would be the main beneficiary of the move, may insist on a 1: 1 declaration in view of the company's Rs. 7,486-crore reserve position. While sources say that earlier this fiscal IOC had submitted a detailed plan proposing a 1: 2 bonus, company officials are only willing to confirm that the issue is under active consideration and may materialise. FIPC set up with Vaghul at helm In a bid to garner and absorb at least $10 billions in foreign direct investment (FDI) each year as enunciated by the United Front in its common minimum programme (CMP), the Union Government has constituted the Foreign Investment Promotion Council (FIPC) under the chairmanship of Mr. N. Vaghul, Chairman of Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI), to undertake vigorous investment promotion and marketing activities. Assisting him in this task, as members of the Council, will be Mr. Ashok Ganguly, former Chairman of Hindustan Lever, Mr. Gurcharan Das, former chief of Proctor & Gamble, along with the Presidents of the three apex chambers, namely, the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Assochajn), the Confederation of Indian Industry (Cll) and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI). HC quashes MSE membership selection process The Madras High Court has quashed the membership selection process of the Madras Stock Exchange (MSE) and declared the present selection list as void. The selection process began in 1994. In an order today, Mr. Justice J. Kanagaraj, said the Authorised Assistants should be given preference in granting membership as stated in the bye-laws of the MSE, according to the Exchange officials. The Court said the increase in the number of fresh members to be admitted for 1994, from 50 to 60, was also inadmissible. The initial plan was to give membership to 200 applicants in four years and about 50 every year.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive One of the biggest threats to the Rio Olympics will come from the internet Saturday Aug 6, 2016 at 3:33 PM Christopher Woody The Brazilian government plans to flood the streets of Rio de Janeiro with 85,000 armed soldiers and police to ensure security on the ground during the Olympic Games. But several reports and analysis from experts indicate that one of the biggest threats to visitors will come from the internet. An August 2 report from cybersecurity firm Fortinet, first spotted by Insight Crime, found that the "volume of malicious and phishing artifacts (i.e. domain names and URLs) in Brazil is on the rise." The country saw an 83% increase in malicious URLs, compared to just 16% growth for the rest of the world, the report found. Worldwide phishing activity was also up, with a 76% spike from April to June, Fortinet reported. "Additional email phishing takeaways include increased activity from Tokelau with the top four country code domains in Q2 2016 being Brazil, Columbia, Russia and India." According to a report from Kaspersky Lab, Brazil sustained the most attacks from phishing attempts, with workers at the games being targeted for their credentials. "In February we identified a very interesting targeted campaign, on our domain monitoring system, against the IOC using the malicious domain masquerade as their Intranet portal," Kaspersky's report said. "The purpose of the attackers was to steal credentials of IOC employees working in Brazil." Kaspersky researchers also said that tests on the ground in Brazil "showed roughly one in four wireless internet access points likely to be used by tourists were highly vulnerable to cyber attacks," Insight Crime noted. "There's certainly sophisticated criminals that can clearly propagate" identity theft and compromise credit cards, Jim Hutton, chief security officer at On Call International and former director of global security for Proctor and Gamble, told Business Insider prior to the games, which run from August 5 to August 21. "If companies are traveling, especially sponsor companies," Hutton added, "they might be traveling with proprietary information about marketing plans or customer rollouts, as part of their hospitality program. That could all be at risk too." Bill Evanina, a top US counterintelligence official, told USA Today in June that events like the games are a "great playground"’ for government intelligence services and criminals because of the "sheer number of devices." This kind of activity won't be new to Brazil. The US State Department's Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) reports that annual losses related to cybersecurity and online fraud in Brazil reach billions of dollars, and, as Insight Crime notes, these illicit activities have grown more sophisticated in recent years. "Brazil continues to rank as one of the most pervasive cybercrime environments worldwide," the OSAC said earlier this year. "Brazilian cybercriminals have grown more brazen, stealing billions of dollars annually despite new legislation and official efforts to stop malicious activity online." Recent reports indicate that online criminal groups from other parts of the world are trying to link up with cyber criminals in Brazil, and with as many as 500,000 visitors expected to flood Brazil for the games, they may have plenty of targets.

More crying! More bees! How to breathe new life into hit TV MasterChef, The Apprentice and Bake Off all look a bit stale. We can fix that Replace Mary Berry with Katie Price! Photograph: BBC/Love Productions Stuart Heritage @stuheritage Monday 8 August 2016 08.00 EDT Last modified on Monday 8 August 2016 08.01 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close When a television series has been around for a while, it faces a choice. Does it carry on, ploughing the same old trench over and over again without deviation until viewers get bored and stop watching? Or does it attempt a high-risk format tweak? Sometimes that can be a good thing (The Voice became much better when it cut back on live shows), and sometimes it backfires completely (The X Factor six-chair challenge is basically bear-baiting with glitter). But it’s often necessary. British TV is full of hoary old veterans in danger of dying of irrelevance, so here are the fixes that will rejuvenate them. MasterChef Facebook Twitter Pinterest Bring back the Passion Test, an un-British sensation... Photograph: BBC/Shine TV A change doesn’t always have to a new innovation – sometimes it can simply be the return of an old favourite. Think how much better MasterChef would be if they brought back the old Passion Test, which was a real thing where the contestants had to sit in front of Gregg and John and demonstrate their love of cooking by shouting or wailing about their dead relatives in such an un-British demonstration of abject hysteria that it made your genitals shrink to a microdot. God, I miss the Passion Test. Dragons’ Den Facebook Twitter Pinterest Send in the clones… Photograph: BBC Change is already afoot on the long-running BBC Two series, with Theo Paphitis being replaced by a man who looks identical to Theo Paphitis. This should continue. From now on, all the Dragons should have a legion of exact physical lookalikes in the wings, and inventors can only get their money if they first fight their way down a corridor of furious Deborah Meaden clones. Too much? Then let’s mix things up next time by hiring a Dragon who isn’t an almighty swaggering berk who dresses like an estate agent and doesn’t derive a weird sexual kick from exploiting or rejecting the desperate at their most vulnerable. The Great British Bake Off There’s more than a fighting chance that our beloved Bake Off will move to ITV next year. If that’s the case, these changes are all but guaranteed: 1) Mel and Sue will be replaced by Carol Vorderman. 2) Mary Berry will be replaced by Katie Price. 3) Paul Hollywood will get to judge the show in skintight racing leathers, and give sympathetic scores to any bake that can be crushed down and used as a makeshift talcum powder. 4) There’ll be a live studio audience that repeatedly tries and fails to clap along with the theme tune. 5) Thanks to an ongoing channel-wide product placement deal with Procter & Gamble, every showstopper bake will include Daz as a primary ingredient. Countdown Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pelt the contestants with bees! Photograph: Channel 4 After 33 years on air, Countdown is as concrete a format as you can get. Nothing major should be changed here, although I would recommend either shocking the studio audience with electricity so they look a bit more lively – or sporadically pelting the contestants with bees during the numbers round. Watchdog The signature sequence of Watchdog is when a presenter visits the office of a fraudulent CEO and shouts questions at them until they get in their car and drive off. As fun as this is, it’s far too short. How about getting the presenter to follow the CEO into their car and punch them in the face while they try to drive, then dress up as their wife and seduce them until their entire life becomes a waking nightmare of confusion and suspicion and they have no choice but to refund an old lady £25 for her faulty guttering. The Apprentice Facebook Twitter Pinterest Get on the go-karts now! Photograph: Jim Marks/BBC/PA Now 11 years old, The Apprentice has long since shed any notion that it’s about clever people looking for a great job. It’s now so transparently about self-interested dimwits extravagantly mucking up basic tasks that the BBC should just bite the bullet and give the people what they want. Why not kidnap the candidates, inject them with a powerful hallucinogen and drop them inside a revolving hall of mirrors full of warped fairground music and crying children, then leave them there till they can adequately construct an Ikea Billy bookcase, at which point Alan Sugar will appear and let them drive go-karts for the afternoon? You’d watch that, right?

The presence of untapped market for diapers and emergence of hybrid diapers are laying growth opportunities for the market, during the forecast period. Explore Report with Detailed TOC at: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/diapers-market The delayed toilet training of children in developed countries and growing online purchase of baby diapers are the two trends witnessed in the global diaper market. The age at which toddlers become diaper free is increasing, since the past few years. In 1957, approximately 92% of children were toilet trained till 18 months of age, as compared to 2015 in which only 65% of children were reported to be toilet trained till the age of 36 months. As the per capita income of consumers in the developing countries (such as the U.S.) is more, as compared to those in the developing countries; it is easy for the people of developed countries to afford expensive diapers for their children. This trend is expected to influence the revenue of the global baby diaper market during the forecast period. Request for Report Sample: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/market-analysis/diapers-... Due to the massive growth of population in developing countries, the use of diapers is also increasing. As the per capita income of consumers is increasing, the consumers are focusing more on personal and baby hygiene. Good hygiene is an important barrier to many infectious diseases, including the fecal–oral diseases, and it promotes better health and well-being. To achieve the greatest health benefits, people are focusing more on improvement in hygiene. The modern baby diapers and incontinence products have a layered construction, which allows the distribution and transfer of urine to a penetrable core structure, where it is locked. Diapers provide hygiene, cleanliness, comfort, and independence to the babies and adults. Though diapers are helpful in maintaining the personal hygiene of babies and adults, they are very unnatural in many ways. This has led to the increasing demand for diapers made from natural raw-materials. The global baby diaper market is driven by the manufacturers involved in introducing baby diapers that have better breathability, are soft, and cause fewer rashes on the baby's skin. Browse Related Market Research Reports at: https://www.psmarketresearch.com/industry-report/consumer... The declining birth rate in developed countries is the key factor restraining the growth of the baby diaper segment of the market. The major companies operating in the global baby diaper market include Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Procter & Gamble, Unicharm Corporation, Kao Corporation, SVENSKA CELLULOSA AKTIEBOLAGET SCA, Bumkins, Fujian Heng Group Co. Ltd., Bummis Inc., and Nobel Hygiene Pvt. Ltd.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Investors Are Going Crazy for This High Yield ETF August 7, 2016 3:32pm NYSE:GIS NYSE:K ShareTweet We’ve been writing about it for a while, but despite the concerns of how much investors seem to be overly chasing income in the form of high yield ETFs, there is no denying investors have been right to keep pouring money in them — for now. One of the better performing ETFs in 2016 is the PowerShares High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers Portfolio ETF (NYSE:PEY), which is up over 18% year-to-date. In looking at some of the ETF’s top holdings it’s no surprise to find big telecom names like Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T), as well as tobacco plays like Altria Group (NYSE:MO) and smaller tobacco companies like Vector Group (NYSE:VGR). Sector-wise, utility stocks make up 20% of the overall ETF holdings, followed by financial services at 17%, and consumer-defensive stocks like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Kellogg (NYSE:K)and General Mills (NYSE:GIS), with that group making up 16% of the ETF’s overall holdings. This market environment’s current yield-buying frenzy focus comes as Treasury bond yields have fallen to record lows. When the obsession with yield will end is anyone’s guess. Perhaps the Federal Reserve actually raising interest rates will be the remedy to offset set what appears more and more to be a yield-chasing bubble which has resulted in record-highs in terms of valuation. We’ll certainly be keeping tabs on this ETF and plenty more like it. Here are the top 10 holdings currently in the PowerShares High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers Portfolio ETF: PEY closed at $15.82 per share on Friday, up $0.14 (+0.89%). PEY has gained 18.5% year-to-date, compared with a 7% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index.

Vanguard has been one of the more vocal participants in evaluating active managers and the consequences of stock-based investment strategies. Academic research into the matter confirms Vanguard’s hypothesis: Most managers that claim to be active are not consistently adding value to the market return. Each year is pronounced the year that active management will win, but this is rarely the case. Why does active management seem to be so ineffective at beating the market? The majority of the investment community attempts to add value by selecting individual stocks. Investors weigh one company or theme more than others. Investment managers spend their time searching for inefficiencies in the valuation of individual companies in order to outperform the market.  However, much like any free market, the more individuals focus on finding inefficiencies, the fewer inefficiencies there are to exploit.  It therefore comes as no surprise that the significant research staff and budgets of the largest mutual fund complexes are unable to outperform a passive collection of stocks: their size and past success has resulted in an efficient market. Is the only solution then a static allocation of passive, market-weighted investments?  No — inefficiencies will always exist.  Therefore, the plan should be to seek out inefficiencies and exploit them.  With nearly everyone fishing the same pond for individual company opportunities, it might serve investors to look for fishermen that have elected to change ponds and fish where ample opportunities exist. Research consistently shows that the two largest components to long-term investment return are market participation and asset allocation.  However, very few of the large firms focus on those factors.  Instead, they focus almost all of their attention on finding the next Google, Proctor & Gamble, or Home Depot. This issue was highlighted in a CNBC panel on October 20th, 2015 with leaders from three prominent mutual fund families.  They all promoted active management, focusing on stock selection and argued that 2015 was the year of the stock picker.  When the host asked if they ever make asset allocation calls or market participation calls, the CEO of one said they leave that decision to the client.  These three large investment firms readily admitted to leaving the two most important investment decisions to the client.

Our take: Credit to Mayor Dennis Connelly for getting talks started again. Connelly realized the mall is the town’s biggest taxpayer and is now working to get a deal done — a move that figures to result in more revenue for an area still adjusting to the closing of Fort Monmouth. It also will bring a better mall. Retail is changing dramatically. If towns don’t upgrade their malls quickly, they will lose a lot of revenue. Not so business-friendly French fragrance company Mane USA has halted its plans for a proposed manufacturing and research facility in Morris Plains, due to some public outcry from Hanover and Morris Plains residents. Our take: Small towns need to be careful feeling they can pick and choose which companies come in. The state needs jobs and industry — why turn one away? The move was announced the same week that Procter & Gamble said it will shut its facility in Woodbridge by 2018. Business-friendly (take two) Aurobindo USA has broken ground on the 567,000-square-foot facility it is building as a new U.S. headquarters in East Windsor Township, the municipality last announced week. Aurobindo, a pharmaceutical company based in India, is building a new warehouse, distribution and manufacturing center on the 90-acre site, which will generate more than 400 new jobs when up and running. Our take: Now that’s what the state needs. Each week in Face Time, NJBIZ editors approximate Chris Christie's mood and facial expressions based on the news. FACETIME:TREND SETTER Gov. Chris Christie called for the state to investigate whether Bridgegate investigative committee co-chairs Sen. Loretta Weinberg and Assemblyman John S. Wisniewski used state resources for political attacks on him. Days later, Senate President Stephen Sweeney called for an investigation of union activities (in an unrelated case). Perhaps “Probes, not Potholes” should be the new motto for Trenton.
