IMAGE: Big challenge for Girish Singhania to train unemployed youth . Photographs, kind courtesy: Edubridge     When Girish Singhania, 33, was working with Procter & Gamble (P&G), he noticed a wide gap in what the company needed for its sales force in rural areas. There were hundreds of unemployed youth willing to work for the company, but they were not suitable as they had no soft skills or training. Even if they found suitable persons for the job, retaining them was a huge challenge. Singhania, an Indian Institute of Management Bangalore (IIM-B), alumnus, worked with P&G for two years before moving to investment banking in Edelweiss in Mumbai, but the idea and his experience stayed with him. His job at Edelweiss required him to talk to investors in various countries and discussions with them made him see that they were looking for investment opportunities in the education sector. The second year of his work at Edelweiss made him travel to almost 100 villages across India in four states (in connection with some offerings from Edelweiss). In October 2009, Singhania – then 25 - decided to set up EduBridge, a company that would be socially relevant but would also make money. Operations started in July 2010. The idea was to train the unemployed youth in semi -urban and rural areas and train them well. IMAGE: Average salaries are typically Rs 10,000 a month for students.     The model The training is for entry-level service-sector jobs, which typically last one to three months, after which 300-350 recruiters hire them. The cost of the training - which is between Rs 10,000 and Rs 15,000 - is paid partly by the student and partly by government-funded skill development programmes or companies’ corproate social responsibility schemes. It focuses on spoken English, computer basics, soft skills, and personality development. Then, there is a module that trains them for specific jobs. They are placed at call centres, food and coffee chains, hospitality (hotels and restaurants) and banking. Average salaries are typically Rs 10,000 a month for students whose average family income is Rs 6,500 a month. Funding and future plans In the initial years, the company raised debt funding (Rs 3.5 crore) from National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) in 2011 and it raised equity funding through Acumen in 2012. The company has been profitable three years in a row since 2013-14 although the numbers are not public. Six months ago, the first big breakthrough came in funding when it raised $2.5 million (global funding companies like Insitor and Acumen have both invested). The money has helped Singhania invest in technology and grow faster. It is adding 25 new employees and four-five centres every month. The goal is to reach 100 centres by December 2016 with a total employee strength of 500. Doing it differently EduBridge is not the only company in this space. It is competing with large players such as Teamlease, ILFS, NIIT, etc, but Acumen India head Ajit Mahadevan says the problem with companies in the ed-tech space is that as they scale, their quality suffers. EduBridge has scaled very slowly. In the first five years, the company had 20 centres. It is only in the past year and a half - and after its latest round of funding - that it is growing at a much faster pace. By the year-end, it expects to touch 100 centres and will have 500 employees on board, several of whom are graduates of IIMs and Indian School of Business, Hyderabad. Second, the company has managed to keep a strict check on quality by keeping all its 150 trainers on the rolls. “We use our franchises only for infrastructure and their ability to mobilise the unemployed youth at the centre,” explains Singhania, arguing that keeping the training entirely under their control ensures quality. This is unlike many competitors who outsource trainers.  A third factor that distinguishes EduBridge is that it works almost as hard to retain its trainees as in training them. For every hundred people trained, only around 50 stay on the job. Realising this, the company started a helpline for its trainees – especially those who leave the jobs but at a later stage want to join again. Singhania says the training they give now works just as much on “mind sets as skill sets” since retaining those trained is critical. NSDC’s Jaikant Singh, head for partnerships and state engagement, says he sees no comparison between EduBridge and its present rivals. “Comparing EduBridge to ILFS or Teamlease is like comparing Aam Aadmi Party to Bharatiya Janata Party or Congress, which have been around for a long time.” He says unlike others who do training along with “whatever else they do”, EduBridge’s bread and butter is training.  EXPERT TAKE: V Gayathri It’s been a consistent journey for EduBridge, going by its achievements in training and placement in different sectors. The leadership team is quite focused on making a social impact combined with profitability that can be sustained. Though they have been cautious, it’s time for them to speed up and explore the growing market in the business-to-government segment, particularly with the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana and the Skill India Mission. This will strengthen EduBridge’s presence in the market through a variety of training programmes linked with employment. To grow further, it is also important that it execute the projects with utmost quality and meet standards such as The National Skills Qualification Framework. Another challenge it needs to overcome is that its training results in appropriate placement and the candidates become its ambassadors to spread the positive results. And, instead of limiting to entry level skill-based training, it can also explore other sources of revenue by addressing the needs for higher order skills meant for career progression. I’m confident its model can be scaled to accommodate the emerging needs from the industry and the job market. V Gayathri, chief executive officer, LabourNet Services India Pvt. Ltd. FACT BOX Number of centres: 75 in 14 states  Numbers trained in 2015: 30,000  Cost of training: Rs 10,000-15,000  Duration of training: 1 to 3 months  Total employees: 330 Trainees’ placements:  IT/ITeS (Data entry operator and call centre agents) – Serco, Tata Business Support Solutions, Hinduja Global, etc  Retail:  Shoppers Stop, The Mobile Store, Arvind Brands, Westside, etc  Banks: HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, etc  NBFCs: HDB Financials, Fullerton, Mahindra Finance, DHFL, etc  Hospitality: Café Coffee Day, KFC and so on  Others – Paytm Anjuli Bhargava.

How Old-School Tactics From Emerging Economies Can Inform Local Marketing September 22, 2016 by Florian Huebner 1 Comment Filed Under: Commentary Pokémon Go took only 3 weeks to generate 75 million downloads worldwide. Marketers were quick to pounce on the phenomenon, seeing nothing but opportunity, especially for local businesses: Create a virtual Pokéstop which coincides with your bricks-and-mortar store — genius! It’s a wildly successful game, but it’s also an anomaly: You can’t expect Pikachu to do all the heavy-lifting when it comes to long-lasting local marketing strategies. Rather, there’s tremendous insight in old-school marketing tactics about to how to strengthen local digital strategies through offline expertise. Here are a few tips from a few ever-impressive emerging markets. Nigeria: Create an enormous selling-network Despite being legally restricted to their operating regions, fintechs still find local attention tough to capture. This is why Nigeria is so exciting. A 95% cash-based economy makes everyday transactions highly inefficient and insecure. Payment and transfer fintechs like Pay Attitude, Bitpesa and *737* have proliferated, benefiting from Nigeria’s deep mobile phone penetration (Pew Research estimates it’s above 90% this year). However, it’s Paga, the SMS-based payment fintech that really stands out. In a truly innovative (but old-school) local marketing move, Paga simply created the selling-network it needed. Over the past 4 years, the company has trained over 10,000 people to become Paga agents, who access the market by tapping into their existing networks. Agents are mostly established local entrepreneurs, such as shop owners, with deep local knowledge and connections. A grocery store owner could recommend his customers pay with Paga, for instance, allowing the company to provide an everyday and useful demonstration of its product. This effectively brings the market to them – evidenced in its estimated 70% reach of Nigeria’s adult population. So if you’re finding online local marketing isn’t penetrating the region you want — don’t wait for existing platforms to take your product on — create a partner network where you can both interdependently benefit. India: Respect regional differences and persuade Parts of India unfortunately still suffer from inadequate health care, with both education and resources lacking. Because of this, one challenge for the Indian branch of P&G has been to market its products to locals for whom certain healthcare products may be unfamiliar, and also possibly taboo. In a recent report by McKinsey, however, the company was able to successfully navigate cultural sensitivities, particularly when it came to women’s health. So just how did it market its Whisper brand of its sanitary products to communities where similar goods were not used before? P&G targeted local female figures of authority — including teachers and police officers — who could appropriately provide classes in schools on the subject and product. This created a word-of-mouth local success, with the campaign reaching 2 million girls in more than 150,000 schools. This not only has enormous health benefits, but creates lifelong trust in the brand; McKinsey reported that the campaign resulted in a drastic reduction in cloth-based protection from 66% to 6%. Differing from the Nigerian Paga, P&G shows that there are subtler ways to work: work with brand consultants to navigate and tailor your local marketing key messaging for different regions. China: The devil is in the details  When buying a laptop, you might just go online, read a few reviews, compare prices and buy. In China, however, customers typically make at least four trips in-store to speak with shop assistants, test the product, and compare. Through surveys, business consultancies MEC and CIC recently highlighted the changing consumption behaviors of middle-class consumers in China, noting a greater tendency towards security and safety when purchasing. They found that up to 75% of Chinese consumers are very reluctant to buy electronics online or from abroad: Not the best market for impulse products! Computer manufacturers and outlets therefore reach customers the old-school way — through TV (79% of all Chinese companies market primarily through television, according to Forbes Insights). But China has about 3,000, mostly local TV stations, meaning single national advertizing campaigns are easy to plan, but they lose impact along the way. A more successful strategy is to segment geographies to get a higher share of voice through local outlets. This also promotes the notion that a brand treats the region as a priority – something very important to Chinese consumers. Therefore, companies like Lenovo buy local TV advertising across all relevant regions, and make only tiny modifications to a single advert: Changing the location name. The lesson? Minor details have major payoffs. Locations, languages, even dialects – use these to your advantage. Brazil: Care about local distinctions In China, it’s only the advertising which is locally tailored. In Brazil, however, entire business models are. Each Brazilian region has vastly different demographics, which creates drastic differences in industry segmentation. For example, consumer packaged goods tend to be concentrated  in the Southern, more wealthy parts of the country, with McKinsey reporting that more prestigious big-box stores make up to 70% of retailing overall in Brazil, but only 55% in the North. Such demographic differences have killed off the chances of clumsy brands, but Natura, the market leader for toiletries, has thrived. Not only does it manufacture locally-sourced products, but it works closely with 32 local, sometimes-remote communities in the poorer North, to help develop the workforce and connections it requires. It has also expanded the skills of 5,000 small suppliers by providing training and partnership opportunities. Furthermore, it has carried out well-publicized sustainability campaigns which have demonstrated concern for the environment, and the lifestyles of the communities it works with, with INSEAD showing that Natura is one of the leading local companies to campaign for sustainable development. Natura shows that by tying your company to the success of the region, you create a real sense that you care about it, and belong to it. Something that benefits the company in a concrete way, as they have now expanded to markets outside of Brazil, including Europe. Make your online local marketing demonstrate that you care about where you are – use it to showcase CSR projects, and recommend regional events and successes — be a part of your location.

Hilary Says: Are Expensive Beauty Products Always Better? 01.09.2016 at 11:58 am By Hilary Rodriguez-Taiwo 8 Comments When it comes to cosmetics, expensive doesn’t always mean better. The truth is that there are good and bad products in all price categories. It’s all about the formulation not price. It’s quite interesting to find out which companies really own your favourite brands. It can also help you save money. For example, L’Oreal owns: Lancome YSL Beauty Body Shop Giorgio Armani Beauty Kiehls Urban Decay Garnier Maybelline NYX Estee Lauder owns: Bobbi Brown Clinique GlamGlow Jo Malone Crème De La Mer MAC Smash Box Tom Ford Beauty There are other global cosmetic companies that have so many cosmetics brands under their wings like Coty, Unilever, and Procter & Gamble etc. If you look at the ingredients list on products made by the same company, you’ll find that some cheaper brands use the same ingredients as the more expensive ones. Let’s have a look at Lancôme Advanced Genifique Youth Activating Serum and L’oreal Youth Code Serum Intense. It is quite common for L’Oreal and Lancôme to offer similar products whose only significant differences are price (L’Oreal owns Lancôme). Lancôme Advanced Genifique Youth Activating Serum 1.0 Oz/30ml – $78 “A powerful youth activating serum that reveals youthful radiance and smoother skin in just 7 days. Drop by drop, this potent serum boosts youthful radiance, restoring smoother, more radiant skin you can see and feel in just 7 days” Ingredients: Water, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Glycerin, Alcohol Denat., Dimethicone, Hydroxyethylpiperazine Ethane Sulfonic Acid, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Sodium Hyaluronate, Sodium Hydroxide, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Adenosine, Faex Extract/Yeast Extract/Extrait De Levure, Peg-20 Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Peg-60 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Salicyloyl Phytosphingosine, Ammonium Polyacryldimethyltauramide/Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Disodium Edta, Octyldodecanol, Citronellol, Fragrance. L’Oreal Youth Code Serum Intense 1.0 Oz/30ml – $25 “Restore fresh glow. Boost Hydration. Rapidly diminish first lines…..Skin looks rested, smoother and youthfully luminous” Ingredients: Water, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Glycerin, Alcohol Denat, Dimethicone, Hydroxyethylpiperazine Ethane Sulfonic Acid, PEG-20 Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Sodium Hyaluronate, Salicyloyl Phytosphingosine, Palmitoyl Oligopeptide, Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7, Adenosine, Ammonium Polyacryldimethyltauramide / Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Disodium Edta, Caprylyl Glycol, Citric Acid, Xanthan Gum, N-Hydroxysuccinimide, Chrysin, Octyldodecanol, Sodium Benzoate, Phenoxyethanol, Limonene, Fragrance Both serums have these ingredients in common: Water, Bifida Ferment Lysate, Glycerin, Alcohol Denat., Dimethicone, Hydroxyethylpiperazine Ethane Sulfonic Acid, Sodium Hyaluronate, PEG-20 Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate, Adenosine, Ammonium Polyacryloyldimethyl Taurate, Limonene, Xanthan Gum, Caprylyl Glycol, Sodium Benzoate, Disodium Edta, Citric Acid, Octyldodecanol, Fragrance. The most important ingredients in both serums are exactly the same. So both serums will do pretty much the same thing. The important ingredients are: Bifida Ferment Lysate, Glycerin, Sodium Hyaluronate and Dimethicone. The rest of the formula is mostly preservatives, stabilizers, and fragrance. Let’s talk about these ingredients. Bifida Ferment Lysate It is a type of gram-positive bacteria found in the digestive system. According to L’Oreal, it can repair DNA, improve the skin’s barrier function and hydration but there is no research to prove that it has any anti-aging or gene-stimulating effect when applied on the skin. Glycerin & Sodium Hyaluronate They are both humectants. Humectants draw water from the environment into the skin to keep it hydrated. Dimethicone This is a silicone emollient, which can make fine lines, and wrinkles look smaller by filling them in. These results are only temporary, once the serum comes off, the wrinkles will still be there. Most anti-aging serums have dimethicone in them. In Conclusion Lancome Genifique costs three times as much as L’Oreal Youth Code but they will do exactly the same thing. Both serums can temporarily reduce the appearance of fine lines/wrinkles but they will not eliminate them. It’s quite odd that they have alcohol in both serums at high percentages, as alcohol is known to be drying, irritating and cause free-radical damage. If you have dry and sensitive skin, I wont advice you to use any of these products. The truth is that cosmetics companies want you to believe that they have the answer to fine lines and wrinkles. “Just put this cream on and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles will be visibly reduced!” Technically – that statement is true. However, the message that consumers get from this claim is different than the words that are written and marketers know this. If you moisturize your skin, the fine lines and wrinkles will plump up and they will appear to fill in. Also, thanks to brightening pigments or silicones that smooth out the surface of the skin so that it reflects light better, these products can really reduce the appearance of wrinkles. Appearance is the key word here. The claim simply means that the product makes wrinkles look less obvious, not that it gets rid of them. It also means if you use this product (and continue to use it) your wrinkles will look better.  Unfortunately there is no lotion, serum, cream, or oil that can reverse the effects of age and gravity on our bodies.

The Real Oma September 1, 2016 at 12:43 pm I can tell you for a fact that expensive is not always better. I have used some pricey products on my brown skin and i have also used very cheap ones, and what i have learnt is that only 4 things matter most to my skin – exfoliation (a firm sponge/loofah is enough), a moisturizer with enough oil (i add a bit of bio oil and olive oil, just recently started adding coconut oil, so soon to ditch the bio oil), drinking a lot of water, and eating healthy. My current moisturizer is St Ives Mineral Therapy and i bought it last for 2100, before the recession it was 1,300, and it even retailed for 950 when i started with it. And i have really good skin, in fact, just this morning i got two compliments on its radiance. So, no, expensive does not mean better – genes, nutrition and general skin care, are the more important points. Signed, Oma with the good skin :)) Love this! 19 Reply Anon September 1, 2016 at 4:03 pm Buying expensive beauty products is like buying designer apparel. You are really buying the name. Expensive beauty products contain the most carcinogenic substances and are not good for sensitive skin. Even the ones that state they are good for sensitive skin are not good for spot prone skin. Quite a few of them contain micro beads and there’s a recent ban on micro beads. Some of them contain egg shells, ostrich shells and some other shells which some people find irritable (they cause break outs.). It’s best not to trip over them. Love this! 15 Reply Dr Ebele Ugochukwu September 1, 2016 at 9:06 pm very interesting article; a topic I had been considering doing myself. when I was formulating my skin care range, I was on a tour of factories in Taiwan; I noticed that the production lines were the same for most companies and it is only twds the end that they diverge into different lines for the final packaging and sealing. I was shocked to learn that most of products of these cosmetic companies we patronize all come from the same factory and sometimes with the same formulations only different packaging. when I thought about it, I realized it actually made sense, two different companies with products containing shear butter will use the same shear butter only possibly in different quantities. most formulations are similar so its just a matter of finding one that suits you and it will not necessarily be the expensive one; you are always paying for the brand name when buying expensive things; as a consummate shopaholic, I long since realized this. @the real Oma, I was proud to read your post, you really know what you are talking about. exfoliation is very key for good skin so also is drinking a lot of water. Check out my skin care line S.Studio skin care. its very well formulated and very affordable; wont cost more than what your are paying now, I promise you it will take your skin game to the next level. Love this! 9 Reply Sarah September 2, 2016 at 6:22 am Wow. You own Sleek Studio. Awesome. Love this! 7 Reply seyi September 1, 2016 at 11:04 pm Thank you for this informative and depressing article. Loolz Love this! 8 Reply Heav September 8, 2016 at 1:51 pm Nice and informative article. Can you recommend a good anti wrinkle preventive cream for me? I live in the uk. I know I can’t stop the inevitable but I will like to slow or control it. Am just 30 but age is telling on my face. Love this! 4 Reply Hilary Rodriguez-Taiwo September 10, 2016 at 11:50 am Hi Heav, one thing i always tell people is that your skin grows from the inside out. There’s not alot you can do from the outside in. Drink loads of water, eat foods with antioxidants (there are so many, check online), cut down your sugar intake, exercise too. Free radicals are one of the things that damage and wrinkle our skin, they are everywhere so antioxidants will help fight them. Keeping the skin hydrated is very important, it helps the skin function the way it should and makes it look plump so wrinkles are less visible. You can get a serum with retinol or a good humectant like Hyaluronic Acid. The serum i use is the Radha Beauty Vitamin C serum, it also has Vitamin E and Hyaluronic Acid, i combine it with the Radha Beauty Retinol Moisturizer; it works for me. Love this! 3 Reply Heav September 26, 2016 at 3:42 pm Tnanks. Apologies for the late reply.

Stocks normally experience bigger-than-usual volume trade as a result of significantly important bits of new information that affect the stock as it reaches the market. This creates a strong stimulus among market traders and investors to either sell or buy (acquire of offload) their stock/s, which result in heavier trading volume, and usually strong momentum for the stock as well.

One of the buildings in that park is basically windowless; you might mistake it for a warehouse or, if you were feeling exotic, a data center. The only thing that’s remarkable about the structure, signaling there’s something of great value inside, is an imposing floor-to-ceiling metal turnstile in a guarded vestibule. This building is a modern-day mint. It’s where JPMorgan Chase, the largest issuer of credit cards in the U.S., manufactures around 60 percent of the 95 million cards it issues each year. The company requires visitors to keep its exact location secret. For more than 15 years, the facility has hummed along, embossing numbers onto plastic cards and stuffing them into envelopes. During that time, only three things have really disrupted BAU, Chase-ese for “business as usual”: the Target data breach of 2014, which required the factory to quickly reissue millions of cards; the industrywide 2015 switch from magnetic-stripe cards to ones that include microchips; and in August the frenzied demand for the company’s newest offering—the Chase Sapphire Reserve. Ned Lindsey, Chase’s managing director of customer fulfillment, runs the Ohio plant and a sister facility in Texas. On Aug. 24, Lindsey noticed something strange—card requests were coming in at an extremely high rate, all for the Reserve. “We were seeing demand that was eight- to tenfold more than what we expected,” he says. Lindsey, it seems, doesn’t read credit card blogs. Since July, a fever had been building on social media among points-and-miles obsessives aware that Chase was preparing a premium card—one that would sit above its already-popular Sapphire Preferred, and offer rewards to match. Almost a month before Chase introduced Reserve, the community discovered the card’s perks through some leaked information: a sign-up bonus of 100,000 points, triple points on travel and dining, airport lounge memberships, and credits that offset a $450 annual fee, among other goodies. Of course, like its Sapphire Preferred brethren, the card would have a weighty metal core that creates what is known in the trade as “plunk factor.” © Finlay MacKay for Bloomberg Businessweek Plasticheads got the vapors. “When I first heard the details,” wrote Brian Kelly, aka The Points Guy, probably the most influential card blogger, “I had to sit down, because it sounded way too good to be true.” The Sapphire Reserve, wrote another, Ben Schlappig, is “beyond a no-brainer, possibly the most compelling card we’ve ever seen.” On Reddit, a user shared that Chase had accidentally published a Reserve application link, and thousands of applications poured in before the page was deactivated. By the official launch date of Aug. 23, anticipation had built to the point that the Chase site was bumrushed by a horde of deal-seekers. In Ohio, Lindsey brought in extra staff and added shifts. “We had to have a backup plan to the backup plan,” he says. The plant ran hot for about three weeks. During that time, Chase burned through its inventory of metal cards—a stock that was supposed to last 10 to 12 months. (The company declined to say how many Preferred or Reserve cards it’s issued.) To continue to sate the appetite for the Sapphire Reserve, Chase had to switch to standard plastic cards as placeholders. The bank says it’s now sent out as many plastic cards as metal—two years’ worth of cards, gone in less than a month. When the first cards were shipped, some customers posted “unboxing” videos on YouTube, reverently exhibiting terms-and-conditions pamphlets to the camera. The videos have garnered more than 60,000 views; the Reddit thread has 10,000 comments. The hype usually reserved for a new iPhone was now being applied to a high-interest line of credit. And until mid-September, Chase hadn’t spent a dime on advertising. Chase is not the first issuer to offer a big-annual-fee-but-mucho-points card. American Express and Citibank have been playing in that part of the market for years. But Chase has entered at the right time—when a growing community of enthusiasts will do the company’s marketing online for free—and with the right card, one that assiduously checks every box the modern credit card deal-hunter cares about. None of this happened by accident. The process to create new credit cards is little different from the research Procter & Gamble does to develop a new laundry detergent or Honda does to develop a new crossover SUV. A credit card is a means of payment and the extension of a loan, but it’s also a collection of perks and points that confer experiences and status upon its user, as well as an object people typically touch several times a day. In a country with more than half a billion credit cards already in circulation, it’s not a given that any new combination of attributes will work. Chase had already learned a thing or two about how to make a card more than a card. The Sapphire Preferred, introduced in 2009 with a $95 annual fee, was the reigning “It card” before Reserve came along. One especially devoted cardholder is Bryan Denman, a 35-year-old New York creative director, who has taken advantage of Preferred’s perks to treat his girlfriend to Chase-sponsored private dinners at the restaurants Craft, Rebelle, and Le Bernardin, as well as to get good seats at venues like Madison Square Garden. Denman recognizes that loyalty to a credit card is unusual. “Everyone’s brought up to distrust their credit card company,” he says. “You don’t want to be on the phone with them; why would you want to spend the night with them?” But his experiences with Chase have conferred upon Denman the zeal of a convert. “I am a complete fanboy,” he says. “I’m telling everyone to get this card.” He’s not alone. “When I go to dinner, there might be three cards that get thrown down. They’re all Chase Sapphire.” At Chase, finding the Bryan Denmans of the marketplace is a task led by Gordon Smith. When he’s not restoring classic sports cars—like a 1969 Jaguar E-Type from England, where he grew up—he’s in charge of the company’s card and consumer-banking divisions. Having previously headed up the U.S. card business for American Express, Smith joined Chase in 2007. When he got there, he saw that the bank’s card business was little more than a consumer-finance operation. In that context, he says, “a customer doesn’t think about themselves really as having the credit card. They think about themselves as having the loan.” This wasn’t where Smith wanted his credit card division to be. A card that people think of as only a loan is not a card customers have a relationship with, much less a card they want to use all the time. “They could keep the card itself in a shoebox, not necessarily in their wallet,” says Smith. At the same time, the marketplace was going through an upheaval. The financial crisis led banks to step back from offering plastic to anyone with a pulse, and many Americans drastically cut their credit card bills. The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act of 2009 placed numerous restrictions on how issuers could penalize or otherwise dun their members for exorbitant fees, erasing billions from the low end of the market. Cards for more affluent consumers were a safer bet. The right kind of card in this environment would have to be, as they say in the credit card industry, “top of wallet”—something you use frequently as your preferred method of payment. The reason has to do with the fact that card issuers can make money in two ways: interest and fees or interchange. The recession and the CARD Act made the interest-and-fees strategy a much harder proposition. “It was clear that revolving-credit cards were not going to be the moneymaker they once were,” says David Robertson, the publisher of the Nilson Report, an industry newsletter. Interchange became the way to go. Someone who uses his card all day, every day, for everything from a cup of Starbucks to a new Rolex Submariner, is allowing his issuer to collect a small fee on every transaction. That fee—the interchange—is higher for premium cards such as Chase’s Sapphires. The fee is higher still when the card is used at a luxury retailer, which is more likely with a high-end card. And since the fee is something charged to the merchant, not the shopper, it saves banks from incurring more consumer wrath. For all these reasons, Chase decided to pursue a premium strategy. But a premium credit card would have to be something different in 2009 than when they first came about in the 1980s and ’90s. That market was effectively established and defined by American Express, which had launched cards like the Platinum in 1984 and the black Centurion card in 1999. Its top-shelf cards came with hefty annual fees ($450 and $2,500, respectively) but also a complement of perks and services that, it was suggested, could almost change the laws of nature to meet your needs. Dedicated concierges could secure last-minute reservations at popular restaurants; Centurion cardholders could be greeted at international airports and whisked through customs and immigration. In the throes of the Great Recession, Chase judged that luxury would have to be cloaked in understated virtue, not sybaritic excess. The modern affluent customer was more Joni Mitchell than Joan Collins: more casual, more discreet—millionaires with minivans. To attract that kind of customer, a new credit card would have to offer a sense of being a sound financial choice. One way for Chase to do that would be to lower the annual fee from hundreds of dollars to $95. “When you look at where you’re going to price something, on a per-unit basis it can be very profitable obviously with a high price, but you’re going to find a much smaller group of people who will find the product attractive,” says Chase’s Smith. “How do we price it in such a way that it would be economically viable for us, but the customer will look at it and say, ‘You know what? I have to pay a fee, but that’s good value.’ "That value can also be emphasized by a robust rewards program. The dirty little open secret of those older elite cards was that, for all their swagger and status, they were actually pretty lousy at rewarding their users. “With the American Express Platinum, you get one point per dollar on all purchases other than travel purchases from American Express’s travel agent,” says Jason Steele, a writer for CompareCards.com. “Yet with less expensive annual fees, there are cards that could get two times or three times for every dollar you spend.” Keeping track of miles and points used to be the domain of road-warrior obsessives, who could debate the relative merits of rewards programs with Talmudic specificity, but collecting and using rewards has gotten decidedly more mainstream. Credit card review sites—many of which earn commissions on driving leads to issuers’ websites—act like an accelerant when a new card catches fire. They rank high in Google searches and dominate discussion boards. ThePointsGuy, the site Kelly runs, now has close to 3 million unique visitors every month, which makes it about as heavily trafficked as Bleacher Report, the popular sports site. Many points-granting cards rely on a complex system of rotating bonus categories. The Citi Dividend card, for example, gives 5 percent cash back on Hilton hotel rooms and car rentals in the current quarter; in October, the offer shifts to Best Buy and department store purchases. With Sapphire, Chase opted for simplicity. “What these customers tell us,” says Pam Codispoti, the president of Chase’s branded cards division, “is that rewards matter, but while we want them to be very valuable, we actually don’t want to do a whole lot of work to understand the rules and regulations around them.” Chase introduced the Sapphire Preferred card in 2009 with double points in two large categories: dining and travel. The card also allowed users to transfer their points to a broad range of frequent-flier programs (at the cost of undercutting its existing range of co-branded cards with United Airlines). The moderate fee, generous points, and partner network got the Sapphire Preferred noticed, and as consumer spending began to rebound after the recession, it came to be regularly cited on card-enthusiast sites as one of the all-around best. Chase’s emphasis on value dovetails with the psychology of what the company refers to as the “new affluent”: a segment of the population that is well-to-do but still in its prime earning years. For them, it’s more important to be savvy than fancy. More Kirkland vodka from Costco, less Stolichnaya Elit. “You feel smart with this card,” says Kelly, describing the image of the first Sapphire card. “You’re ‘in the know.’ You’re not flashy.” The design of Chase’s Sapphire Preferred card, which has now been extended to the Reserve, has been a surprisingly powerful asset. Sapphire cards are nearly featureless on the front, with little more than a chip, the cardholder’s name, and some discreet branding. The numbers are flush on the back, but what always gets remarked upon is the card’s weight. With a metal core sandwiched between two pieces of plastic, the Sapphire Preferred has noticeably more heft than a regular, all-plastic card. Chase won’t say what materials are used, but Lindsey, the plant director, says the form factor costs “5 to 10 times as much as a standard card”; chip-enabled cards cost around $2 to make. “I have the Chase Sapphire Preferred, and virtually nothing gives me more pleasure when I pay and the cashier notices how gorgeous that card is,” says Sean McQuay, the credit card expert at NerdWallet, a personal-finance site. (He has since gotten a Reserve; “the sign-up bonus was too good to ignore,” he says.) “Chase has basically realized that the weight raises customers’ dopamine levels. Being able to get into my brain every single time I swipe my card—there’s literally nothing better a marketer could want.” Chase’s neurotransmitter strategy has had a positive effect on its bottom line: In 2007, the bank’s card-services division reported net income of $2.9 billion; in 2015, that figure was $3.9 billion. As the Sapphire Preferred became a success, Smith assembled new teams at Chase to determine what kind of card would appeal to an even wealthier slice of consumers. The market seemed ready: Both Citi and Amex had cut some perks from their high-end cards, such as airport-lounge access and free rounds of golf, disappointing some cardholders. Perhaps they’d be interested in a new card? From the beginning, though, it was clear that the new, upmarket card would share the Sapphire name, which was a new step for the company. “What Chase had done largely before is come out with completely new names” for new cards, says Smith. “So all that brand equity that you built up was effectively gone.” With Sapphire, Smith is trying to develop a platform. Always the car enthusiast, he thinks of Sapphire Preferred as Chase’s BMW 3 Series, and the Sapphire Reserve as the larger, more luxurious 5 Series. “We wanted Sapphire to stand for the things that it always stood for but give us the space to keep growing and evolving it,” he says, “so that the brand name of Sapphire would still resonate with customers and stay relevant.” Smith knows enough about cars to know that above the BMW 3 Series and 5 Series is the flagship 7 Series. While Chase hasn’t said whether it intends to move even further upmarket, it would not be at all surprising if the bank followed Sapphire Preferred and Reserve with, say, Sapphire Premier. That would be a pure play to the affluent, no “mass” required. Already, competitors such as Barclays have launched new cards like the Gold Luxury Card, which comes with a $1,000 annual fee but is actually less rewarding than the Sapphire Reserve. At the top of the heap is American Express’s Centurion, which commands exorbitant fees ($7,500 as an initiation fee, followed by a $2,500 annual fee) for those lucky enough to be invited to join. If Reserve sustains its momentum, a move into more rarefied incomes may be next. “I think a number of issuers think that Amex is ready to be run down,” says the Nilson Report’s Robertson. Fortunately for Chase, it’s getting new cardholders while they’re young—to a surprising degree. When it was originally conceived, Reserve was expected to attract a slightly older customer, but Chase says the majority of applicants have been millennials. Kelly thinks Sapphire has transcended the surly bonds of personal finance. “They’ve built a lifestyle brand out of it,” he says. Perhaps that’s Chase’s greatest accomplishment: It has managed to make Sapphire a modern, desirable credit card for people who would otherwise not care about their credit card. “They’ve managed to take something from being a stupid card you carry in your wallet,” says Denman, “to a part of your identity, like the clothes you wear.” —With Ben Steverman Go to MSN Home More in Money 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money What Trump's win could mean for older Americans CBS News 30 things you should never buy without a coupon GOBankingRates 6 brand mascots that actually existed in real life Business Insider 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

David | @TeflonGeek Sunday, 25 Sep 2016 | 9:57 AM ETCNBC.com SHARES Adam Jeffery | CNBC Former President Bill Clinton sits down with CNBC's Becky Quick the Clinton Global Initiative Annual Meeting in New York on Sept. 20, 2016. Ex-president Bill Clinton has been campaigning furiously to promote the candidacy of his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as she takes on GOP candidate Donald Trump. In addressing a wide range of subjects with CNBC last week, Clinton touched on the growing scrutiny that his family foundation has drawn on the campaign trail. The former president says some of the criticism is "bull," but acknowledged that certain questions would be legitimate if Hillary Clinton wins the White House. He also told CNBC of the pointed advice he gave his wife as voter anger with the political status quo boils over. Read the full exchange between Bill Clinton and CNBC's Becky Quick here: "The stuff that they've said so far is just bull, but if [Hillary Clinton] was actually the president, it would raise too many questions. I think it's fair." -Bill Clinton, former president Quick: Scott, thank you very much. Good afternoon to everyone. Like to introduce our guest today, our special guest, former president bill Clinton. We are here at the CGI. Mr. President, thank you very much for taking the time with us today. This is the 12th CGI, the 12th annual meeting here. This is the last one. Why don't you talk about why this is the last one. Clinton: Well, I think that if Hillary wins the election, it would be impossible to do it because the CGI won't run—the whole idea of it is it's a government business, non-governmental organization, labor partnership, and, you know, it says that we just all work together. The economics of it won't work unless there are corporate sponsorships and unless we can have people from all over the world here. I learned that already in this election that some people were just subject to a presumption of guilt just because they were participating, and to be fair, a lot of times the political press, they have no previous exposure to the way we work even though we've done it for years and made everything public. We disclose everything. Who is giving, what they're doing, and all that. I think that it would be better—I think we've already changed philanthropy. That is, I think more and more people now think instead of just giving money, they should actually make a commitment to specifically do something. I can think about lots of examples. Proctor & Gamble has now given out 10 billion, billion, water tablets that purify water for a family of three for about three days. Beckton Dickinson work on many things has helped develop supply chains with other business partners. A couple of years ago they organized the first hundred tons of medical supplies to the Ebola countries. We had a very unusual commitment with bankers and other people in finance in Detroit to redo the normal mortgage system so we could get people's mortgages on homes in Detroit where the homes are in good shape, but need repair, and the value is driven down because the neighborhood because everybody was out, so they can't get a mortgage, one mortgage, that covers it. We worked hard to do that. There are lots of things like that we've done that require partnerships, and i just think that, you know, it's going to be hard to continue to keep that going. The good news is more and more people are trying to do it, which is what I dreamed of in the beginning. Quick: But it will be hard to continue to do that because you don't want to be asking people for favors as the husband of a president. Clinton: That's correct. And it's fine to do something, you know, all former presidents have foundations and they raise funds. If they were just individual contributions, you could report them every three months. The public could decide. If you —if the very model itself requires international as well as domestic support, then I think it's just —you don't want a private operation doing that if Hillary is the president. I mean, presidents can do that. President Obama and President Bush before him and me, they did public-private partnerships all the time, but nothing on the scale of CGI, and I hope it's a trend toward the future. I think it works better when we recognize that there are always going to be things that the government can't provide and the private sector can't produce and that a group like this working together can do something faster, cheaper, better, but it can't be generated from somebody like me who is outside government but whose wife may be in it. Quick: Because, obviously, people would look at you as a conduit to getting through to... Clinton: Yeah. The stuff that they've said so far is just bull, but if she was actually the president, it would raise too many questions. I think it's fair. Brian Snyder | Reuters President Barack Obama descends the stairs of Air Force One with Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton after arriving prior to a campaign event in Charlotte, North Carolina, July 5, 2016. Quick: You are stepping down from the foundation, but Chelsea is not at this point. She seems to me to be a conduit who would essentially get through to Hillary Clinton too. Clinton: We all know people but when they made that conduit argument the state department said there's nothing to it. The career people at the state department. I think it's quite different if you have the—if the foundation is operating in America taking no corporate contributions, only individual contributions, and disclosing them every three months, as we do now and confining ourselves basically to health and education and service work. We are doing some—we got to finish some of our projects. Our foundation has the largest private infrastructure program in the country where public employee unions are putting in $16 billion to promote building other things that are part of the La Guardia airport improvement, and in the first $12.5 billion that they've spent, more than 100,000 jobs have been created. I kind of think people don't want to stop that. There's not any kind of conflict between the public interest and that, but we do—we are going to give up—I'm going to get off the board. We're going to give up corporate contributions and the individual contributions will be reported on a regular basis. Chelsea has to decide what she's going to do, but somebody has to stay there, as i explained when i said we were going to get out of most of our—almost everything we're doing overseas, or everything, that somebody has to superintend the handing off of all this. We're going set up some of these things as individual foundations without any of our being involved. We're going to transfer the operations to others—to other operations. We're just going to terminate, finish the commitments we've made in some cases. That takes some time to do. You just can't —here's no way in the world—we've got a couple thousand people working for us around the world, and we owe them something. They did great work. Quick: Mr. President, let me ask you about some of the news of the day. Particularly some of the news that our viewers care about. The Federal Reserve is meeting today. We expect an announcement tomorrow about whether they will raise rates or not. And as someone who has studied the economy so closely, do you think our economy here in the United States today warrants interest rates being near 0%? Clinton: well, because Hillary is a candidate, I would be happy to offer an opinion if she weren't a candidate. But I think it would be wrong to do so because she is. However, I will say this. Janet Yellen, Lael Brainard, whom I know, several others—these are really smart people and they'll do what they think is right. And i think the political emphasis is overrated because I think whatever happens is if that they think is right economically will be manageable economically at this point. But it's been a perplexing time. There was a very long tail on this financial crash that explains most of the road rage in the American electorate and much around the world. And so, we just finally had one good year-on-year report on rising per capita income. 5.2 percent. And family incomes. About 2.5, I think. So what they'll do is they'll look at that in the long-term numbers, and they'll see whether they could actually if they've got longer term growth, would it actually help to tick up interest just a tad, or should they leave it where it is because in spite of the growth figure, the jobs figures are not still robustly growing so much. They got more data than i do. I trust them to make the decision. Quick: let me ask you about trade because that's been a huge topic in this election. We actually spoke with Donald Trump last week on CNBC. Here's what he said about NAFTA. He said, "NAFTA is the worst trade deal ever made. Not in this country, but in the history of the world. NAFTA is a one-way street into Mexico and other places." What do you say to that? Fabrizio Bensch | Reuters Consumer rights activists take part in a march to protest against the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) in Berlin, Germany, September 17, 2016. Clinton: Well, we gained manufacturing jobs when I was president. And we gained 22.7 million jobs. And Mexico has prospered. And between 2010 and 2014, although Mr. Trump kept saying we needed the wall, there was no net in migration from Mexico. Mexico is our third biggest trading partner. And until their economy kind of took a little bit of a nose dive after 2014, there was no net in migration because they could support themselves, and they were trying to be good neighbors. Products we import from Mexico have about 40 percent American contributed content. Products we import from china have about 4 percent. So, i think it's a little more complicated than he says. And I think the real NAFTA problem, I mean, the real Mexican problem, is not NAFTA. Look at what happened to carrier. They moved that furnace plant down there. I think that was bad. But that's because of American corporate culture and law and practice. For example, the carrier plants—we're going to move this furnace plant down to Mexico. Well, is the division making money today? Yes. $2.9 billion. Well, are the profit margins going down? No, the profit margins are going up. We're still going to move it down there. Well, the union offered to save you the same amount of money you'll get going down there. They said, you know, we'll change our work rules, we'll save it. Leave the jobs here. No, we want to move it down there. Why? Because of activist investors who demand a profit in a year and a day, and the management who are paid by that. You know, there was a gripping eyewitness report on the board meeting about what happened. That's not NAFTA. That's not running a stakeholders society. We need to go from a shareholder—or at least a top shareholder to a stakeholder society as we once were. And we need the incentives to do that. And if we do that, we'll make better decisions. And we're going to have to trade some because we're only 4 percent of the world's people. We like having 20 percent of the world's income or so. And I think, you know, we got to have the right kind of trade deals. But if you enforce the trade deals and you do it right, they can be positive. The one thing I would say that I learned, though, besides the enforcement issue is both parties, in different ways, let the working people down that wound up being displaced even if they—some they knew they would be, some they didn't. Because people say, oh, well, the market will take care of that. We know better than that. It's not easy to replace jobs lost in southern West Virginia when coal plants close, for example. The last major legislation designed to deal with that was the new markets tax credit I signed. And it is still working. The mayor of Cincinnati told me the other day he was getting some jobs out of it. But we need, as Hillary has called for, a much bigger tax credit and set of incentives for people to invest in areas where there's been trade dislocation, or the economy has moved away, or they're too far away like Native American reservations with no gambling. And we got a lot of work to do on that. I think that America would feel much more comfortable in trading if we thought everybody was going to be taken care of. We have done a poor job of dealing with the people who got the short end of the stick. We've got to do better. Quick: We're going to continue this conversation with President Clinton. Talk a little bit more about trade. Also talk about the Wells Fargo hearing that's been taking place on Capitol Hill. But Scott, I know that you all are eager to get back to that Congressional hearing that's taking place, too. Again, we will bring you more of this conversation a little bit later, but right now, Scott, we'll send it back over to you. Javier E.

Home > News By Company > Future Market Insights Tweet   Releases New Report on the BRICS Disposable Hygiene Products Market Future Market Insights has announced the addition of the Disposable Hygiene Products Market: BRICS Industry Analysis and Opportunity Assessment 2014-2020" report to their offering.   (EMAILWIRE.COM, September 25, 2016 ) The disposable hygiene products market is witnessing an annual growth of nearly 6-7% due to increased consumer spending on personal care products globally. In addition, the demand for improvised comfort, performance and efficient absorbent hygiene products is expected to drive demand for disposable hygiene products in the near future. Concerns for safety, convenience and hygiene are identified as key factors affecting growth of disposable hygiene products market. Furthermore, rising consumption of products such as sanitary pads, wipes, baby products and others across the globe is anticipated to drive demand for disposable hygiene products market in near future. Among the developing economies, increasing population and manufacture of such products in countries such as India and China and low penetration of these products is expected to open opportunities for growth of the market in BRICS. Moreover, industry-sophistication is expected to fuel the demand for disposable hygiene products in Brazil. Apart from increasing population in BRICS, economic development particularly in countries such as China and India is a key factor contributing towards substantial growth of disposable hygiene products market in the region. Furthermore, increasing disposable income, rising expenditure or consumer spending on personal hygiene and increasing hygiene concerns are expected to fuel demand for disposable hygiene products over the next five to six years. Also, increasing Internet penetration is a prime factor supporting wide distribution of these products to tech-savvy consumers in BRICS via the medium of online retailing. Internet penetration is expected to enhance distribution of these products, leading to increased consumption and brand visibility among consumers in BRICS. Request Free Report Sample@ http://www.futuremarketinsights.com/reports/sample/rep-br-107 Although hygiene concerns rank high among consumers in the BRICS region, low awareness among people in rural areas coupled with low adoption of products in regular operations could hamper growth of the market. However, some international companies are focused on advertising campaigns along with the government awareness campaigns regarding hygiene. Although hygiene concerns in BRICS region is high, low awareness among people in rural areas coupled with low adoption of products on a regular basis is expected to restrict market growth. Moreover, cost reduction coupled with efficient packaging of the disposable hygiene products is concern for companies operating in this market. As a result, a few international companies are focusing on advertising campaigns along with product portfolio expansion through opening of new manufacturing units. For instance, Unicharm Corporation, Procter & Gamble India and Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget SCA (publ.) among others, have opened new manufacturing units for hygiene products in India. For instance, Unicharm Corporation invested US $ 39.2 million to set up a manufacturing facility with the objective to develop baby care, pet care and feminine care products in India. The disposable hygiene products market is segmented on the basis of product type and material used in products. The various disposable hygiene products include nappies, diapers, toilet paper, wipes, sanitary protection, kitchen towels, paper tableware, cotton pads and buds. These products are classified according to age-group since product usage differs accordingly. On the basis of age-group, the market has been segmented into adult care, feminine care and baby care. The materials used in these products are broadly classified as woven or non-woven, which depends on the acceptability of the product as well as age-group for which they are designed. Among all the product categories, the sanitary pads and baby products are collectively expected to be a promising area in the BRICS disposable hygiene products market. Among all the BRICS countries, India and China are expected to witness an increase in demand for disposable hygiene products, followed by Brazil and Russia.

By Julie Edgar Sept. 26, 2016 -- Krista Calderon first bought Wen hair products more than a year ago, believing that using something billed as “natural” would be better for her hair. At first, she noticed that her eyebrows lost their shape and figured that the person who waxed them had messed up. Then she noticed that her leg hair was patchy. Five months into using two of Wen’s cleansing conditioners, she called the company to ask why she seemed to be losing hair. She was told she wasn’t using the products properly. By December -- 8 months after she started using them -- she saw that the part in her hair was widening. Around the same time, Calderon read an article on her Facebook page about complaints against Wen and “put two and two together,” she says. The experience left her with crippling anxiety. “I didn’t want to go out from January 2016 until recently. I really became a recluse,” says Calderon, 26, who lives in Southern California. She estimates that from April to December 2015, she spent $300 on the Wen products, which are often advertised in late-night infomercials and in online ads. The cleansing conditioners sell for about $25 and up. She’s since thrown them out, slowly regaining her emotional footing along with her hair. Calderon is among tens of thousands of Wen by Chaz Dean Cleansing Conditioner users who had a similar experience. The company, based in Santa Monica, CA, has received more than 21,000 complaints about the products. But spokesman Joe Hixson denies they are the cause of the hair loss, breakage, and scalp irritation described by users. The company has proposed paying $26.2 million to settle a class-action lawsuit against it. Hixon says the settlement is not an admission of guilt. It would pay out about $25 apiece to most of the plaintiffs, he says. It would also require the company to include a caution on the label. Wen continues selling the conditioner and its other products, highlighting what some say is a lack of federal oversight of the $62 billion cosmetics industry. Continued The FDA doesn’t have the authority to recall the products on its own or to test a product for safety until someone complains. That’s what it did in 2014, after receiving 127 complaints about Wen cleansing conditioners -- the highest it had ever received about a hair cleaning product. The FDA sent a warning letter to the company and investigated its manufacturing sites. It issued an alert in July about the cleansing conditioners while it continues looking into what, if anything, led to hair loss and breakage. Should the FDA’s investigation find that something in the Wen products caused the reaction, the most the agency can do is ask the company to voluntarily pull them from shelves. Given a heightened awareness of the health risks that ordinary beauty products and cosmetics may pose, Congress has stepped in with proposals to boost the FDA’s authority. Lawmakers have introduced two bills pushing for more regulation of cosmetics: the Safe Cosmetics Modernization Act, introduced by Rep. Pete Sessions, R-TX, and the bipartisan Personal Care Products Safety Act, co-sponsored by Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Susan Collins (R-ME). The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee held a hearing on the Feinstein-Collins bill on Sept. 22; it won’t be put to a vote until 2017. Both bills would require companies to register with the FDA, submit product ingredient lists, notify the FDA of any reports of serious side effects, and authorize the FDA to prohibit the sale of products that have been found to cause serious health risks. The Feinstein-Collins bill would also require larger cosmetics manufacturers to pay a fee based on annual revenues. Feinstein says that the Wen case highlights why the bill is needed. “With increasing evidence that certain ingredients are linked to a range of health concerns, ranging from reproductive disorders to cancer, it’s critical that we update the 80-year-old law designed to ensure personal care products are safe,” Feinstein wrote in an email. The Personal Care Products Council, a lobbyist for the industry that represents companies like Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson, has announced its support of the proposal, along with the Environmental Working Group and a handful of medical associations. Continued “We believe that well-crafted, science-based reforms will enhance our industry’s ability to innovate and further strengthen consumer confidence and trust in the products they use every day,” John Hurson, executive vice president for government affairs for the council, wrote in a media statement. The Feinstein-Collins bill also mandates that the FDA test at least five ingredients in the products for safety. Every year, they would have to test different ingredients. In the first year after it passes, they include formaldehyde; propyl paraben; diazolidinyl urea; lead acetate; and quaternium-15. They are preservatives and antimicrobials found in products ranging from shaving cream to moisturizers. Ingredients like parabens are endocrine-disrupting and can affect reproduction and organ development, says Heather Patisaul, PhD, a biology professor at North Carolina State University. She is a spokeswoman for the 18,000-member Endocrine Society, which supports the Feinstein-Collins bill. There is also evidence that some of the chemicals, like formaldehyde, may raise the chance of getting cancer. Patisaul acknowledges that age, sensitivity, and length of exposure to an ingredient affect how a person might react. Millions of people use creams, balms, and hair products every day, and don’t have health problems. “When we’re thinking of how chemicals are affecting people, we need to consider how they affect sensitive individuals,” she says. “We’re not trying to demonize all chemicals, but to find a small subset that is the most problematic.” Law professor and former FDA attorney Patricia Zettler says that in the decades since the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act was enacted, we know far more about the things we put on and in our bodies. “It makes sense to consider whether the regulatory system we have is what we want,” she says. Cost, though, is an issue, as is a lack of consensus on the safety of the chemicals that help our moisturizers stay fresher and smell better longer. “Part of the issue with cosmetics may be that we just don’t have scientific certainty about ingredients, so one thing to consider is, do we want labels or better information and research about the impact of ingredients and cosmetics? What do we want out of policy?” Zettler says. Continued Calderon, the former Wen hair products user, supports more transparency among cosmetics manufacturers. Simply using a hair product turned her life upside-down, she says. She stopped volunteering at a local health center and dropped out of a college class that required her to speak in public. “Everybody thought I was losing my mind,” she says. “In a sense, I was. I feel like gradually losing your hair is a little worse than losing it in clumps.” WebMD Health News Reviewed by Brunilda Nazario, MD on September 23, 2016 Sources SOURCES: Krista Calderon. FDA.

"Evolution is essential to remain relevant and thrive, and we're constantly evolving our business, building on an already strong foundation to deliver good growth — growth that's profitable, responsible and sustainable — for the long term," said Chairman and CEO Benno Dorer. "From our origins in disinfecting as a bleach company to our recent acquisition of digestive health company Renew Life, Clorox offers a broad portfolio of brands that make a difference in the health and wellness of people's lives. This report also showcases how we've evolved to create meaningful value for all our stakeholders." The report details the company's progress against its 2020 Strategy, which encompasses financial and corporate responsibility performance, in areas such as innovation, technology, employee engagement, diversity, environmental sustainability and community support. The report's feature story on health and wellness shows how the company's portfolio includes brands that encourage a better diet, enhance skin care, and help create healthier surroundings in homes and businesses. A companion video, featuring a conversation with Dorer, provides further insight into the company's health and wellness journey. The company's 2016 fiscal year financial results include the following: $5.8 billion in net sales $398 million in cash dividends 36 percent total shareholder return, third in the company's peer group [1] 3 percent incremental sales from product innovation These key nonfinancial metrics are among those highlighted in the report: 87 percent employee engagement, which is one point higher than last year, eight points higher than levels at global fast-moving consumer goods companies [2] and about three points higher than companies combining superior financial performance and human resources practices.

[4] Diversity in corporate governance, including 50 percent minority independent board members, 30 percent female independent board members and 31 percent female Clorox Executive Committee members. Environmental sustainability improvements marked by cumulative reductions in greenhouse gas emissions (17 percent), solid waste to landfill (25 percent), energy consumption (14 percent) and water consumption (14 percent) since 2011 [5] and cumulative product sustainability improvements to 31 percent of the company's portfolio of products.

Peer companies — an average of 16 consumer packaged goods companies, excluding Clorox — used for benchmarking purposes. [2] The Willis Towers Watson global fast-moving consumer goods norm consists of over 162,000 employees from 59 companies. This norm is comprised of a weighted average of employee survey results from a cross-section of organizations who produce fast-moving consumer goods. The data are derived from recent client studies and a representative sample of employee data collected through general workforce attitude studies conducted by Towers Watson. The norm is updated annually. [3] The Willis Towers Watson global high-performance norm is based on responses from 145,000 employees at 28 companies. Companies qualify for the norm by meeting two criteria: 1) superior financial performance, defined by net profit margin and/or return on invested capital that exceeds industry averages; and 2) superior human resources practices, defined by employee opinion scores near the top among the most financially successful companies surveyed by Willis Towers Watson. [4] Based on corporate benchmarking by Clorox, we consider a recordable incident rate, or RIR, of 1.0 or less to be world-class. Our FY16 RIR of 0.61 means that for every 100 Clorox employees, we averaged less than one reportable incident during this past year. According to the latest available data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average RIR for goods-producing manufacturing companies is 3.8. The criteria used to determine RIR follows U.S. Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration guidelines and is applied globally. [5] CY 2015 vs. CY 2011 per case of product sold. [6] Financial equivalent of 123,053 volunteer hours, calculated at $23.56 per hour, based on the 2015 U.S. value of volunteer time from IndependentSector.org. Less than 5 percent of these hours are by employees outside the U.S., but all are calculated using the U.S. average rate.   Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160923/411416 Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160913/407107LOGO Video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1I90kfDVyRE   To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/evolve-this-clorox-2016-integrated-annual-report-highlights-fiscal-year-progress-against-2020-strategy-and-more-than-a-century-of-evolution-in-health-and-wellness-300333576.html SOURCE The Clorox Company Copyright (C) 2016 PR Newswire.

To support Ad Age and the industry we cover please either: SUBSCRIBE or WHITELIST US In an Ad Blocking Battle, Whose Side Is Google On? By George Slefo. Published on September 26, 2016. Reprints Reprints Most Popular Ad blocking looks increasingly like the marketing industry's forever war, with plenty of damage done but little resolved. Publishers are experimenting with keeping out visitors who run ad blocking software, for example, only to see their tech inadvertently turn away "innocent" people. The makers of Adblock Plus initially fought Facebook's countermeasures by wiping out not just ads, but other posts too. And now even Adblock Plus wants to sell ads, news that only deepened the cynicism among its users. But along with the intrusive pop-ups and tracking cookies that drive people to block ads, the web is marked by an unusual concentration of power at just two companies: Google and Facebook. Many participants in the internet economy are nervous about the duopoly's ability to set the terms online. Now what they—especially Google—do next could potentially steer the outcome of this conflict for better or for worse. Adblock Plus has actually had a good thing going with Google until now, charging it and other major players to participate in its Acceptable Ads program. Adblock Plus, a for-profit enterprise, says it takes a 30% cut for letting those ads through. (Smaller publishers take part for free.) Although it's unclear how much money Google is kicking in, it's bound to be covering a big chunk of the bills for Eyeo, the maker of Adblock Plus. Then earlier this month, Adblock Plus bungled the announcement of its plan to create its own ad exchange through a partnership with a company called ComboTag. Dubbed the Acceptable Ads Platform, initial reports said Google and AppNexus would supply ads to it, news that left marketers with their mouths open. "This launch was riddled with hyperbole," said Brian Kane, co-founder and chief operating officer at Sourcepoint, a company that helps publishers figure out how to counter ad blockers. "It was surprising that they would name AppNexus and Google as partners, but the truth is AppNexus and Google did have a relationship with ComboTag. If they hadn't gone public with it, my guess is AppNexus and Google would have continued to do business with ComboTag." As it happened, AppNexus cut ties with both ComboTag and Adblock Plus, adding that it holds the existing Acceptable Ads toll booths "in low regard." Google distanced itself too, saying it was parting ways with ComboTag and wouldn't have anything to do with an Adblock Plus ad exchange. "It's an uncomfortable development for us," Sridhar Ramaswamy, senior VP of ads and commerce at Google, told a gaggle of reporters at the Dmexco conference in Cologne, Germany. "We have no involvement in their program and this is not a business we want to be part of." But the debacle drew attention to the involvement Google does have with Adblock Plus. In fact, Google is likely Adblock Plus' largest, most lucrative customer. Paying Eyeo allows Google's keyword search ads to survive the filters of Adblock Plus, one of the most popular ad blocking systems available. The sums involved are not small. EMarketer estimates Google will capture $47.57 billion in search ad revenue in 2016, representing 55% of the search ad market worldwide. The web's other great power, Facebook, has been less amenable to ad blockers' agenda. The social media powerhouse has lately been trying to foil Adblock Plus by making it hard for the software to tell ads apart from the rest of its content. It took the opportunity to call out the pay-for-passage system that keeps Eyeo running. "Some ad blocking companies accept money in exchange for showing ads that they previously blocked—a practice that is at best confusing to people and that reduces the funding needed to support the journalism and other free services we enjoy on the web," Andrew Bosworth, VP of ads and business platforms at Facebook, wrote in a blog post. "Rather than paying ad blocking companies to unblock the ads we show—as some of these companies have invited us to do in the past—we're putting control in people's hands with our updated ad preferences and our other advertising controls," he added. The fight soon became half arms race, half PR battle, with Adblock Plus quickly announcing a workaround and Facebook retorting that the "fix" erased users' content along with ads. Facebook seems to have gotten the better of the ad blockers for now, but that's not likely to be the end of it. "This is not the way we think is the most constructive because Facebook's approach critically leaves out one group and that's the user," said Adblock Plus spokesman Ben Williams. Meanwhile, just days after Adblock Plus kicked the hornet's nest anew with its ad-selling scheme, Google came out to say it had teamed with Procter & Gamble, Unilever, The Washington Post, the 4A's agency association and others to form the Coalition for Better Ads. Its collective goal is to monitor the quality of ads with a system now in development at the Interactive Advertising Bureau's Tech Lab. Only ads that make it through the coalition's filter will appear on the websites of participating companies. If Google and others decide that they've cleaned up web advertising enough, will the temptation grow to quit paying into Adblock Plus and its Acceptable Ads? With neither Facebook's nor Google's financial support, funding for Adblock Plus would look very different, to say the least. Eyeo's business model has separately come under increased legal scrutiny in the company's homeland of Germany. In June, Cologne's higher court sided with Axel Springer, saying that Adblock Plus can obstruct ads, but can't charge the publishing giant to let its ads appear. Mr. Williams said potential pressure on Acceptable Ads revenue was not a main motivation for the plan to sell ads, and that losing one paying partner, even Google, wouldn't be devastating. "I would not classify this as a 'let's prepare' type of thing," he said. "That wasn't part of the decision-making process at all." "I want to be really clear," Mr. Williams added. "We are a company. We're not a nonprofit and we're not trying to be. So of course profit is one of our motivations. And I think that gets lost in the discussion. We have to pay our employees and I'm not sorry about that. But at the end of the day, I do think it is possible to do something that is beneficial and can serve a greater good, but that also makes money."

A study undertaken by Magnetic, the marketing agency for magazine media in the UK, in partnership with media agency Carat, used the latter's Integrated Communications Evaluation (ICE) approach to look at the impact of magazine media assets across both print and digital, including display and advertorial and native solutions. This found that online magazine media was 41% more effective at delivering brand KPIs such as purchase consideration, purchase intention and recommendation, than other online environments. The ability to drive associations of quality and relevance for brands was also particularly strong for magazine media, building on their trusted environment and credible content, the study added. Separate research conducted by Magnetic with digital analytics company Moat, produced similar findings, with Magnetic member sites found to have an interaction rate 18% higher compared to other online environments, with interaction times 30% higher. Major advertisers are well aware of the potential value of magazines. On the other side of the world, Procter & Gamble has also been extolling the virtues of magazine brands, a spokesperson telling Ad News that "a strong media brand is incredibly valuable to advertisers as it has strong connection and trust with its readers and the power to influence them and encourage trial". They added: "We've seen great success in partnering with print and magazine brands on bespoke campaigns to drive trust and advocacy of our brand benefits and promise." When Magnetic looked in more depth at the ways advertisers can work with magazine media, it found that campaigns with both display and advertorial or native activity were 20% more impactful on brand KPIs than those with purely display. "Magazines achieve deep human connections with their audiences, leading to a more attentive consumer who is more open to commercial messaging and more inclined to trust what they discover there," said Sue Todd, CEO of Magnetic. "In an age of adblocking and declining receptivity to advertising, this is a powerful environment for brands."  Data sourced from Magnetic, Ad News; additional content by Warc staff Read more from Warc: Media Planning Toolkit: Planning magazine media Millward Brown on why salience isn’t everything - and magazines still matter Newsbrands and the multiplier effect Register for a trial Sign up for news A daily bulletin for marketers Related News Facebook faces new heat on metrics Supermarkets drive Aussie mag growth Social performance is on the rise Other top stories How should marketers define creativity?

The celebrations, held under the slogan, ‘Our Heroes are in Our Hearts’, displayed the love and gratitude of the citizens for the Saudi soldiers safeguarding the country’s borders and for their sacrifices to ensure the Kingdom’s security and safety. Aiming to bring joy to the shoppers, the National Day activities included traditional folklore dances such as Al-Ardah Al-Najdiya and Al-Mizmar, which were performed by various local groups at the HyperPanda stores. Each store in the three cities put up a wall displaying the picture of a Saudi soldier saluting the Saudi flag. Next to the wall a flagpole with a Saudi flag was erected to highlight the values of patriotism and national identity. Shoppers took souvenir photos while Panda staff in all the three stores wore T-shirts with the slogan ‘Our Heroes are in Our Hearts’ printed on them to express their solidarity with the soldiers protecting the borders and enhance the citizenship values in shoppers. On the occasion, miniature flags and balloons were handed out as gifts to families and kids. As part of the celebrations, a new Guinness World Record was set for the largest number of people contributing to a rubber stamp image at the HyperPanda Al Andalus Mall branch in cooperation with Ismail Ali Abudawood Trading Company Limited (IATCO) and Procter & Gamble (P&G)’s Tide brand. The event featured a 4mx2m stamping wall at the HyperPanda mall bearing the map of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on which participants put colorful stamps. “I would like to congratulate the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman Bin Abdulaziz, the Crown Prince and Deputy Crown Prince and the Saudi people on the occasion of the 86th National Day. May the blessing of security last forever and may Allah the Almighty guide our government to always serve Islam and our Kingdom,” said Muwaffaq Mansour Jamal, Chief Executive Officer, Panda Retail Company. “This is a momentous occasion during which we remember the heroic acts of the late King Abdulaziz Bin Abdulrahman Al Saud, the founder of the Kingdom. It is an occasion that commemorates the unification of the Kingdom,” Jamal added. “We hold the National Day close to our hearts and celebrate it annually as part of our national duty and in line with our sense of responsibilities. We want to give citizens and expatriates, young and old, a great opportunity to observe this day with joy and showcase the Saudi national pride on this occasion. This is also an opportunity to display how proud Panda staff members are of their nationality and their beloved country.” He said this year’s celebrations were held under the slogan, ‘Our Heroes are in Our Hearts’ to emphasize that the citizens are standing by the Saudi soldiers on the borders. “Our country is safe and secure by the grace of Allah the Almighty and the efforts of our government and heroes on the borders,” he pointed out. On this day, the value of loyalty, entrenched in the citizens and the brave soldiers, is clearly manifested. The heroic acts of our soldiers will always be remembered and appreciated, he added. Various segments of the society took part in the celebrations in huge numbers to express their pride for the country and the brave soldiers. — SG TAGS HyperPanda Jeddah Saudi National Day SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleYemen plans UN complaint over Iran weapons transfers Next articleCambridges touch down in Canada Sadiq Hussain RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR IISJAA-IFPL makes rousing start Saudi Arabian Airlines announces the appointment of a new CEO of Saudia Air Transport Company (Saudia) Worker dies in accident at Haramain Train project site NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply November 2016 S M T W T F S « Oct       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30   STAY CONNECTED 1,486,011FansLike 41,110FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts Deterrent for non-recurrence Nov 18, 2016 Sexual harassment Nov 18, 2016 Women in Riyadh feel more at ease without niqab Nov 18, 2016 American couple ruin stereotypes about Saudis Nov 18, 2016 Saudi Arabia set to reinforce its climate change commitments Nov 18, 2016 Archives November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 July 2015 © Saudi Gazette 2015 All rights reserved.

Toggle Navigation A-   A+ Sign in News   Stock Home «Back CSR moves to next level as Nestle tweaks taglines Vivean Susan Pinto | Mumbai Sep 25, 2016 06:21 PM IST In a first by a consumer goods company in India, Nestle will tweak the brand taglines of three of its top products — Maggi, Nescafe and Kit Kat — as it seeks to espouse a cause.  While corporate social responsibility (CSR) is now mandated by law as two per cent of profits have to be devoted to it according to the Companies Act, 2013, companies do not touch their brand properties when doing so. Instead, it is common among companies to earmark a portion of sales for a cause. Procter & Gamble's Shiksha programme, for instance, endeavours to do only this by urging consumers to buy its products.  Some others such as Hindustan Unilever (HUL) have fused the brand and cause together in its bid to project what Unilever Global Chief Executive Officer Paul Polman has repeatedly said: "Brands with a purpose". So, handwashing and Lifebuoy, for instance, go hand in hand. So does Brooke Bond Red Label and brotherhood. The latter association had culminated in the transgender band called '6 Pack Band', which won the Glass Grand Prix at the Cannes Advertising Festival this year.  In Nestle's case, however, popular taglines such as '2 minutes', which appears below the Maggi brand name on a pack will now be '2 minutes for education'. Similarly, KitKat's 'Take a Break. Have a KitKat' will be 'Take No Break for Education'. While Nescafe's 'It All Starts with a Nescafe' will be 'It All Starts with Education'. The company will run this initiative for two months during the festive period and is expected to push this aggressively in its bid to improve sales for the cause. Brand experts say companies will increasingly begin thinking out-of-the-box when it comes to CSR. "There is an element of seriousness to CSR now, partly because it is mandatory and second, companies have evolved when it comes to brand communication. Having a social purpose is now considered critical to a brand's DNA," says Harish Bijoor, CEO, Harish Bijoor Consults.  Tata Tea's 'Jaago Re' or Havell's 'Hawa Badlegi' are other examples of how brands are now aligning to a cause at a more serious level. Jaago Re, for instance, asking people to vote, pushing specifically for categories, such as women and youth, to cast their ballot during elections. Havell's, on the other hand, has been consistently pushing for a 'change in mindset' through its commercials, at times even landing in a controversy. An ad about the issue of reservation in education by Havell's earlier this year was panned for touching a sensitive chord. Brands are slowly but steadily understanding the merits of cause marketing.  Advertisement << Previous Article   «Back Most Read Demonetisation: Get Rs 2,000 cash at petrol pumps from Nov 18 ATMs in small cities, villages will take weeks to be ready More trouble ahead as Tata Trusts get I-T summons for tax avoidance Modus Operandi: How black money hoarders are trying to escape I-T lens Ratan Tata should step down for crisis to abate: 6 suggestions from NYU's Damodaran More From Companies Vikram Johri: Lessons from a scandal Bajaj commences production of 400-cc bike from Chakan plant Natco plans to double drug filings next year Infosys invests Rs 14.5 crore in Danish artificial intelligence start-up No Indian Pharma company in world Access to Medicine Index [ more ] Top Stories Banks to serve only their respective customers tomorrow; elderly exempted Shekhar Gupta: The WhatsApp governance Jayalalithaa recovered from her ailment, says Apollo Hospitals chairman ATMs in small cities, villages will take weeks to be ready Modi's cashless economy is good business for Microsoft [ more ] Markets Cash crunch chokes off India palm oil imports MCX to levy concentration margin from December Gold quotes at huge discount, price hits 4-month low Diamond exporters eye 8-10% rise in exports in coming quarter Nifty nears 6-month low, Sensex ends 77 points lower [ more ] Companies GreenSignal Bio Pharma IPO runs into rough weather, no response from QIBs Mopeds gain speed, overtake scooters in growth Youngsters should pursue more research in maths: Narayana Murthy Bharat Forge acquires US-based Walker Forge Tennessee for $14 mn Pellet maker KIOCL to acquire 51% stake in Odisha PSU Idcol [ more ] Opinion Shekhar Gupta: The WhatsApp governance Why Gruh Finance isn't a top pick among analysts anymore?

(AP Photo/NBC, Virginia Sherwood) comments Don't be surprised if elements of "Peter Pan" show up in the commercial breaks during NBC's live Thursday telecast of the famous 1904 play. Walmart, which ran ads during NBC's live broadcast of "The Sound of Music" last year that used songs from the play to make a marketing point, will again serve as lead sponsor of the live event, and will use commercials that echo the action that just took place in the play just before the production cuts to advertising. All five of the spots will also feature Tinkerbell (or, at least, the version of the character being used in the NBC production). Walmart will have the heaviest presence in what is a sold-out program, said Dan Lovinger, executive vice president of entertainment ad sales at NBCUniversal. "I think that the industry, and certainly America, is really falling in love with concepts like this," he said. "It's a great family event. It gives people the opportunity during the holidays to sit down together to watch a show that everyone can be comfortable with." Set to air live at 8 p.m. on Thursday, December 4, NBC's "Peter Pan" production shows the network doubling down on a gambit that worked well last year - and is gaining traction across the TV-scape. Just as Discovery Channel's recent broadcasts of daredevil Nik Wallenda walking a tightrope over Chicago and in the vicinity of the Grand Canyon have lured viewers, so too has the prospect of seeing up-and-coming celebrities hold forth in the title role of NBC's theatrical events. Allison Williams will play Peter Pan while Christopher Walken will play Captain Hook. The network's live broadcast of "The Sound of Music" attracted more than 18 million viewers. NBC has already unveiled plans to mount a live production of "The Music Man" in 2015. Demand for the show has been high, as more advertisers demonstrate a craving to link to the growing number of live events TV networks are testing to lure bigger crowds. NBC sought more than $350,000 for a 30-second spot in the show, Lovinger said, confirming a previous report in Variety. He declined to name other advertisers in the event, but said the show had support from the restaurant, electronics, movie-studio and wireless categories. In five Walmart ads slated to run at specific moments during the program, viewers will see actress Melissa Joan Hart and her actual family in scenes that play off "Peter Pan" moments while also showcasing products available at Walmart. Hart is currently involved in Walmart's holiday campaign. In the first of the spots produced by NBCUniversal, Hart will read a bedtime story to her family as they talk about pajamas (available, as it might happen, for purchase at the large retailer. In a second, the family will play with a Tinkerbell toy and Hart will show her family a "Lost Boys" tree hour lit up in the backyard. In a third, Hart's sons play in the tree house while shouting "Wendy." In a fourth, Hart's family sits around the dinner table preparing to make homemade cookies. In the fifth, and last, Hart reads "Peter Pan" to her kids and talks to them about growing up. NBC was not able to say whether all the Walmart ads will run immediately after the broadcast cuts to an ad break - where they would have the most relevance - or deeper in the mix of promotions that run in each commercial interruption. The concept sounds easier to put into practice than the idea Walmart used during its 2013 sponsorship of "The Sound of Music." As part of that effort, NBC produced a series of spots featuring the Brooks family of Gardner, Kansas, which has 12 children. The clan was spotted at various points in the broadcast doing activities to the strains of the popular tunes from the play. Each spot appeared after the song being featured had been sung in the show. NBCUniversal actually did a four-day talent search for the family that eventually appeared in the ads, which were also produced by the company without the use of an ad agency. Mediavest, an ad-buying firm that is part of France's Publicis Groupe, helped Walmart negotiate the price and placement of its "Peter Pan" campaign. Marketers have shown new interest in crafting commercials for very specific occasions, a reflection, perhaps, of a desire to emulate the content that drew viewers in the first place, instead of interrupting the experience. "Clients in general are getting more and more creative and more demanding to create content that's relevant and resonates with not only our viewers but their consumers," said Lovinger. NBC and Walmart have a history of teaming up for family fare. In 2010, the retailer and Procter & Gamble joined with NBC to create a TV movie, "Secrets of the Mountain," that aimed to offer an alternative to what the advertisers viewed as an increase in risqué fare on the boob tube. After "Mountain" ran in April, a similar effort, "The Jensen Project," aired in July of that year. Broadcasts of the films featured both ads from each company as well as placements of their products and logos in the content itself. Walmart has been spotted sponsoring other pieces of family fare this week. Last night, the retailer had two different commercials run during ABC's "Toy Story That Time Forgot." © 2014 Variety Media, LLC, a subsidiary of Penske Business Media; Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC     More On: Tribune Content Agency Walmart Peter Pan Live!

Sergey Furtaev i LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Many middle-market business owners struggle to determine whether to continue pouring significant time, money and other resources into non-core business divisions or subsidiaries — that is, those that are not vital, essential or are no longer necessary to a company. For many, finding the right answer is a difficult task that often gets deprioritized while they focus almost exclusively on the immediate needs and daily operations of their businesses. Unfortunately, neglecting to address these questions often ends up hurting their businesses and diminishing their success. How should you approach a division that is troubled, not growing, no longer fitting your core business or strategic plan, and/or consuming a disproportionate amount of time and capital? Following is some practical guidance based on my experience helping middle-market business owners evaluate the alternatives and navigate these complex issues. First, an easy answer could be: If the non-core division is losing money and/or dragging down the rest of your business, you might shut it down. However, this quick fix is not always the best course of action. Another party might find value in the division and give you additional capital that you can redeploy for growth. Keep in mind that what is not good for you might be ideal for someone else. If the line of business has this type of potential, you might try to find a buyer capable of maximizing it. So, how should you begin your analysis? ▪ Start by closely evaluating the financials for the business unit you might be looking to sell or shut down. You should also examine on a pro forma basis the financial situation of the remaining business as a standalone unit, thereby enabling you to examine the financial implications of the potential divestiture and make sure it will not hurt your business financially or otherwise. For example, the division might actually be contributing to help cover a part of your overhead. In this case, a divestiture could have more serious financial implications on your overall bottom line than you had imagined. ▪ Evaluate your company’s current management and employee headcount. If you divest the division, do you need to reduce management, as well as your company’s overall headcount? How would this impact your company? Would losing these employees hurt other areas of your business? ▪ Evaluate your real-estate facilities and determine what you should do with any physical space that will be vacated after the divestiture. Let’s say the division you are looking to sell occupies 30 percent of your warehouse. Would you be better off subleasing that space, moving other core business operations into that space, or leaving it open to accommodate future expansion? ▪ You must also evaluate the potential impact of the sale on your clients or customers. Do they currently choose to do business with you because of your ability to serve as their one-stop shop and offer those products or services, even if those products or services are non-core business areas that are unprofitable or loss leaders? Could the sale potentially cause you to lose customers or diminish their satisfaction? Also, what about your competitors — do they currently provide any of those sought-after products or services? If you were to eliminate that part of your business, would you be in effect giving your competitors a greater advantage by positioning them to serve your customers and steal your market share? Big companies continuously evaluate the return on equity, performance and viability of their non-core business divisions or subsidiaries. This helps them to ensure that these lines of business are not hurting their growth rates, overall profitability and success by forcing them to devote disproportionate amounts of time and energy to these areas. Many large companies like GE and P&G continuously evaluate their varied lines of business and remain ready to sell any non-core assets. This best practice helps make them stronger and better focused on growth and acceptable levels of profitability. Some companies may have the in-house expertise to handle these evaluations independently, but others may need assistance from outside consultants. Whatever the case, it is important for middle-market business owners to work with qualified professionals with proven expertise helping companies similar to theirs navigate these issues. While this may require some investment in terms of time, money and other resources, it will pay off in the long run by helping ensure your business is well positioned for continued success.
