David © Provided by CNBC The shave is proving harder to kill than John McClane in "Die Hard." Quotes in the article Procter & Gamble Co PG ▼ 82.66 -0.11 -0.13% Less than two years ago, the growing ubiquity of hirsute men — and the resulting decline in razor blade sales — led The Washington Post to make a dramatic declaration that beards were "killing the shaving industry." Indeed, even Gillette parent Procter & Gamble (PG) groused that the beard trend was detrimental to sales, which at the time were down double digits. What a difference a year makes. Despite beards being as popular as ever, discount razor blade sales are on the rise — which suggests shaving is learning to coexist happily with the boom in facial hair. In fact, Internet businesses that cater to beard grooming have mushroomed concomitantly in the last few years with web sales of razors. "The manual shaving category grew by 101 percent over the past two years, which all brands have benefited from," Taylor Stanton, marketing & communications Manager at Slice Intelligence told CNBC in response to an emailed inquiry. "The online channel has also made it possible for new players like Bevel to emerge and offer shaving products to those who have been underserved by the typical selection at the local grocery store or big box retailer," Stanton added. Recent data suggest shavers are moving to blades sold online — which are far cheaper than premium brands sold by Schick and Gillette. Surging blade sales on the web recently led the latter to start its own online club, while Unilever recently moved to buy start-up Dollar Shave Club for an estimated $1 billion. "Analyzing the online market share of shaving companies doesn't tell the full story. The shave clubs, lead by Dollar Shave Club, completely changed how consumers buy razors," Stanton told CNBC. In a new research report, Slice Intelligence said that with the Dollar Shave acquisition, competitor Harry's "is the razor company to watch." The shaving upstart is actually growing faster year over year than Dollar Shave, Slice says, and is the third-largest shaving brand in the U.S. behind Dollar Shave and Gillette. The latter two comprised "three-quarters of all sales last year. Still, given Harry's high growth rate, it's already made a successful sortie on Gillette, Dorco and Schick's market share," Slice's analysts wrote in a new report on the breakneck growth of online shaving clubs. In an April survey, research firm Euromonitor called internet sales of razor blades "the most important story in men's grooming," estimating that web sales hit $342 million last year — the overwhelming bulk of which were razor and blade sales. However, Slice's research may explain in part why online razor sales have hit a crescendo — many women are also getting in on the action. The firm's data showed that 39 percent of internet buyers of shaving products were women in June, a 7 percent rise since last year. "Currently Dollar Shave Club is the primary brand marketing to women," Slice's analysts wrote. "Their messaging seems to be working as 57 percent of Shave Club's revenue growth has been driven by female buyers since the start of 2015." Dollar Shave is clearly ruling the roost, with Euromonitor data showing the company's $153 million in sales is the clear market leader. Slice's research confirmed Dollar Shave's dominance, but noted that Harry's customers spend more per order ($17 per purchase) than Dollar Shave clients ($7 per purchase). The deep-pocketed patrons of Bevel, another shaving start-up, spend nearly $50 per order, Slice's data found. According to Euromonitor, there's plenty of room for growth, with fewer than 5 percent of U.S. men belonging to an online shaving club. That said, Gillette's foray into the lucrative area is a big wild card, and the growing number of competitors may make it more challenging for Dollar Shave and Harry's. "The nature of this category is changing as both of the leading shave clubs start to increasingly focus on nonshaving products and the benefits of frequently switching razors instead of seeking to compete primarily through low price," the firm added.

In a deal that has shaken the stodgy consumer products industry, Unilever announced last week it will pay $1 billion to acquire Dollar Shave Club, a scrappy five-year-old firm that delivers no-frills disposable blades to subscribers for as little as $3 per month. Since launching in 2011, the Venice, California–based startup has grown to 3.2 million subscribers — earning $152 million in revenue last year and becoming a case study in how a disruptive innovator can "break into a highly profitable and overserved industry." The global razor business has long been built on convincing people they need more and more blinged-out blades at higher and higher prices, said Sharon Terlep at The Wall Street Journal. Dollar Shave Club's "simple, low-price razors have upended" that model. The startup now claims 5 percent of the U.S. men's shaving market, long dominated by the colossus Gillette, a property of Unilever rival Procter & Gamble. Since 2010, Gillette's market share has fallen from 71 percent to 59 percent. Dollar Shave Club's success "shows that no company is safe from the creative destruction brought by technological change," said Steven Davidoff Solomon at The New York Times. Once upon a time, challenging a market leader like Gillette would have required factories, sophisticated distribution, an enormous and experienced sales force, and a TV-marketing blitz. "But the internet, mass transportation, and globalization destroy everything." Dollar Shave Club doesn't actually make any of its products; it contracts with a South Korean razor manufacturer and then sells the blades directly to consumers over the web, bypassing retail middlemen. Because of this lean approach, Dollar Shave Club has just 190 employees. Thanks to YouTube, its initial advertising was essentially free. The company's first irreverent viral video, promising "f—ing great" razors at affordable prices, was responsible for 12,000 orders within 24 hours. Since then, the video has been seen more than 20 million times. When startups can get free advertising through YouTube, easy distribution through the mail, and low-cost sales via the web, "every other company should be afraid, very afraid." Consumers are the clear winners of this brave new business model, said Farhad Manjoo, also at The New York Times. Just as Dollar Shave Club has made buying razors cheap and convenient, Warby Parker has done the same for eyeglasses, Casper for mattresses, and Primary for kids' clothes. "By cutting out the inefficiencies of retail space and the marketing expense of TV, these companies can offer better products at lower prices." And because brands born online live and die by their reputation, their customer service is fast and friendly. Small wonder then that Unilever is eager to "buy its way in," said Catherine Piner at Slate. P&G is also playing catch-up with its own Gillette Shave Club, and has launched the Tide Wash Club, which sends consumers detergent refills for a monthly fee. Both firms are eyeing Amazon, which aspires to provide regular deliveries of everything from diapers to groceries through its "subscribe and save" program. The future of retail is coming, and it's arriving via the mail. Try 4 Risk-Free Issues of The Week magazine. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT SHARE!   Try 4 Risk-Free Issues of The Week magazine.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds log in Site Archive Olympics marketers go for the gold Sunday Aug 7, 2016 at 2:01 AM By Mae AndersonThe Associated Press NEW YORK — Prepare to be inspired. After all, it's Olympic ad time. Olympics marketers from Coca-Cola to Samsung are pulling out all the stops this summer, stuffing scores of athletes into ads and telling tearjerker stories. Coke's ads play on "gold" moments when athletes have a Coke together. An ad for Samsung shows the road to Rio for a runner from South Sudan, the newest country to be recognized by the International Olympic Committee. A Visa ad , customized for different countries around the world, shows a bevy of athletes carpooling to Rio. And P&G continues its "Thank You Mom" campaign with ads focused on how mothers have helped Olympic athletes along the way. SPONSOR CHALLENGES The rah-rah campaigns mask an unsettling truth: It's tough out there for an Olympic marketer. The games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, face a number of big problems ranging from the Zika virus to political upheaval . So companies are opting for campaigns that aim to capitalize on the emotional appeal of the Olympics without lingering too heavily on the specifics of Rio or Brazil. There's an additional challenge. A new rule allows non-sponsors — that is, companies who haven't paid the International Olympic Committee for the privilege of using Olympic trademarks in their ads and other perks — to make greater use of Olympic athletes in ads. All that means a lot of risk, given that sponsoring the Olympics costs about $100 million to $200 million over four years. But that hefty price tag has a reward, too: an estimated 20 million viewers every evening on NBC over the three week stretch of the Olympics. MORE COMPETITION  To protect that major investment by sponsors, the Olympic committee long prohibited anyone but sponsors from using Olympic athletes or Olympic rings or logos in ads. But the age of social media made enforcement increasingly difficult, so this year the rules have relaxed. Advertisers could apply in January to use Olympic athletes in their ads, though they were required to start their campaigns in March and still couldn't use official Olympic terminology or logos. Under Armor has been the most high-profile brand to make use of the looser restrictions, and features swimmer Michael Phelps and other Olympians in ads. Others, including General Mills, Gatorade and Asics, have also applied to advertise under the looser regulation, known as Rule 40. "Rule 40 is changing the landscape. More advertisers are able to use the Olympics, so sponsors are trying different approaches to stand out," said Villanova marketing professor Charles Taylor. ATHLETES APLENTY  One way they're doing so is by featuring more athletes in their ads. Coke's campaign features 79 athletes from 23 countries, including new footage of 24 athletes such as U.S. swimmer Nathan Adrian and Australian hurdler Michelle Jennek. The teen-targeted ads show athletes on and off the field sharing a Coke and having memorable moments like a stolen kiss, dubbed "Gold moments." "The campaign idea is 'Gold' is a feeling anyone can taste," said Rodolfo Echeverria, a Coca-Cola vice president in charge of advertising. Visa's "The Carpool to Rio" campaign features 15 athletes, including New Zealand shot putter Valerie Adams and U.S. swimmer Missy Franklin. The ad shows off Visa payment technology, such as its mobile app and another swiping a credit card at an automated entrance gate to pay for a ferry. The ad, which is airing in 38 countries, was adapted for 14 different markets by using athletes and styles of payments specific to particular locales. "It's very much anchored in all the different things Visa can do," said Chris Curtin, Visa's brand marketing officer.  That multi-athlete strategy lets Olympic marketers avoid the problems that can occur if they bank too heavily on individual athletes. In the most infamous case, then-Olympic sponsor Reebok made little known decathletes Dan O'Brien and Dave Johnson into household names leading up to the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. Posing the question, "Who will be the world's greatest athlete, Dan or Dave?," the campaign had to be modified after O'Brien failed to qualify for the games. GET OUT YOUR HANKIES Of course, it's always possible just to focus more on athletes' inspirational and tearjerker stories than their Olympic achievement. Samsung's "Chant" ad showcases Margret Rumat Rumar Hassan, a 19 year old runner from South Sudan. The ad shows the South Sudanese, a new country in the Olympics, chanting her name and cheering her on. The tagline is "Proud sponsor of those who defy barriers."  "This Olympics the focus is on telling human stories ... the technology doesn't take center stage," said Pio Schunker, Samsung's global head of marketing.  And P&G is continuing its crowdpleasing "Thank You Mom" ads with the tagline "Proud sponsor of moms" that started running in 2010. One of the latest showcases U.S. gymnast Simone Biles and her adoptive mother; it's already garnered more than 2 million views on YouTube.

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ By Ritesh Jain It's a strange world we are living in! A surge in currency in circulation since October 2015 is baffling investors and economists, Bernanke is nudging BoJ to go for helicopter money and in our own Tamil Nadu a bomb is ticking with debt bondage is expanding at a rapid pace. All of this and more for this week! Have a great weekend ahead. Money, money, money! One thing that has been baffling investors and economists alike is the surge in currency in circulation (CiC) since October 2015. During this period, CiC growth has averaged 15-16 per cent YoY, which is a five-year high. In absolute terms, CiC rose by Rs 2.6 lakh crore in the 12 months since August 2015. Besides having implications for monetary transmission via the banking system and higher liquidity, CiC also has implications for tax base and collections, financial inclusion and efforts by the government to squeeze the parallel cash-based economy. The situation was nicely articulated in a report, titled 'Currency in circulation - an unsolved puzzle' by Prasanna A and Abhishek Upadhyay of ICICI Securities Primary Dealership. Currency demand is an interplay of three broad factors - inflation, interest rates and growth. But neither of the three have been able to provide ample insights or explanations for this sudden surge in CiC. Election-related spending led to a temporal surge in CiC, but it is unlikely to trigger this kind of sustained surge. However, a continued increase in service tax over the past few years could have led to tax avoidance by small business owners and consumers, leading to more cash transactions. Add to this the crackdown by the government on accounted transactions, which may be leading to greater hoarding of cash to avoid service tax with higher reliance on cash transactions and avoiding any paper trail. Admittedly both these explanations are not backed by data and remain conjectures. Coincidentally, outward remittances under the liberalised remittance scheme (LRS) have also surged since the middle of 2015. Interestingly, the LRS limit per resident was doubled to $250,000 in May 2015. While this flow is a combination of current and capital transactions and the magnitude involved is but a fraction of CiC, the co-movement between remittances and CiC should provide food for thought to policymakers. Why Unilever did it really? Unilever recently agreed to buy the Dollar Shave Club, an online men's razor for $1 billion. It paid about five times the dollar shave club's expected revenues this year. Much of that premium stems from the value Unilever placed on the razor seller's brand and customer-relationship skills. The key to Dollar Shave Club's appeal is not so much its online prowess, but the fact that it built a powerful brand in four years. Dollar Shave Club developed relationships with men, many itching to find an alternative to the high-price blades sold by Gillette and Schick. It upended the industry's traditional business model by offering a subscription service that sells blades for as little as $3 all-inclusive per month. The company learns about its audience and curates messages specifically meant to keep them engaged. Dollar Shave Club began running television commercials, an expensive tactic tried by very few startups. One made sport of the cumbersome process men go through to buy big-brand razors at a local drugstore. The pricey blades are locked away behind plastic doors that set off a siren when opened without the help of a salesperson. In the commercial, the customer vainly asks for help and tries to grab razors without assistance. He's quickly subdued with a tranquilizer dart. Then Dubin touts Dollar Shave Club as a much better alternative. As per Unilever, the company reached $150 million-plus in sales in 2015. That despite the fact that the blades lack many of Gillette's high-tech enhancements. Few other e-commerce startups can claim to have built a brand so quickly. Unilever and P&G are masters at traditional marketing, mostly offline, but they struggle with the direct-to-consumer brand-building at which upstarts like Dollar Shave Club excel. READ MORE ON THIS Debt bondage in Tamil Nadu Over the last 15 years, G Venkatasubramanian and his fellow researchers at Pondicherry's French Institute have been studying debt bondage among families in 20 villages in Tamil Nadu. While the average income for the sample study has risen 8 times, debt has increased 25 times. The families were slipping deeper into a debt spiral. Other parts of Tamil Nadu are also seeing large changes in how people lend and borrow. And this is seen across income classes. In Trichy, bank officials talk about businessmen with Rs 10 lakh, taking a Rs 30 lakh loan, using Rs 20 lakh in their businesses and lending the remaining Rs 20 lakh to others and at very high interest rates - as high as an effective interest rate of 300 per cent. In the fishing village of Pichavaram fishermen are borrowing more. These loans are expensive - going as high as 5-6 per cent a month. The parties they borrow from have changed - government employees are among the new moneylenders here. Why are farmers borrowing in Tamil Nadu? The first part of the story is simple enough to understand. Neither traditional livelihoods (like farming or fishing) nor their modern alternatives (industrial labour, construction or trading) generate enough income to support families. And drastic change in weather patterns and weak monsoons have not helped either, leading farmers to sell livestock. When agriculture fails, livestock also fails. The problem lies in expenses outstripping income - a common trend across the state and even those outside agriculture are turning to debt. Families have begun borrowing more - for education, daily needs, medical expenses, repaying old loans and housing. The debt problem is so acute that in some families, more than 50 per cent of expenditure is based on borrowed money - and at very steep interest rates - quoted in monthly terms and not annual. A major source of credit in the past was from the state government's self help group programme, which faded out in 2011 with the new government coming into power. With the demand remaining intact, the void was filled by both formal and informal credit including microfinance companies which lent aggressively and without apparently properly assessing the end use of the loan. Do remember that these loans are intended to be disbursed only for livelihood generation, and not for consumption. The lending boom fanned a spike in consumption. Signs of distress are already visible. As per an expert in rural finance, we could be headed for a local politician driven sensationalism with the poor struggling to pay loans at exorbitant rates. Then there could be mass defaults and lenders could lose a lot of money. READ MORE ON THIS Lessons from Japan's experiment From the economic dynamism of the 80s, Japan is now drawing attention largely for its economic stagnation. After years of falling prices and fitful growth, Japan's nominal GDP was roughly the same in 2015 as it was 20 years earlier when its developed peers marched on. Compared with its promises, Abenomics has indeed been a disappointment. The lesson many are quick to draw from Abenomics is that the weapons deployed by the Bank of Japan (BoJ)—and, by extension, other central banks—since the financial crisis do not work. The BoJ has more than doubled the size of its balance-sheet since April 2013 and imposed a sub-zero interest rate in February; still more easing may be on the way. Yet its 2 per cent inflation target remains a distant dream. The BoJ has buoyed financial assets, but it has failed to drum up a similar eagerness on the part of consumers or companies to buy real assets or consumer goods. Japanese firms are reluctant to spend on capex or increase base salaries leading them to hoarding a mountain of cash. A lesson here: monetary policy is less powerful when corporate governance is lax and competition muted. If companies are determined to spend far less than they earn, some other part of the economy will be forced to do the opposite (read the government). Mr Abe set out intending to rein in the public finances and ran budget deficits for 20 years. But after a rise in a consumption tax in 2014 tipped Japan into recession, he has backed away from raising the tax again. Abenomics has not only demonstrated how self-defeating fiscal austerity can be, particularly when it comes in the form of a tax on all consumers. It has also shown that, in Japanese conditions, sustained fiscal expansion is affordable. Without any private borrowers to crowd out, even a government as indebted as Japan's will find it cheap to borrow. Japan's net interest payments, as a share of GDP, are still the lowest in the G7. Politicians in Europe make fiscal rectitude a priority. Abenomics shows that public thrift and private austerity do not mix. Abenomics could succeed only if enough people believed it would. This is a final lesson that Japan's economic experiment can impart to the rest of the world. Aim high. LINK TO THE ECONOMIST ARTICLE Lastly, Charts That Matter I publish a monthly Charts That Matter (CTM) series, which carries the most interesting charts in the financial world that I come across during that month. We just published the August edition. Recently, I have been getting a lot of queries from anxious investors about helicopter money, and understandably so. Does it entail that the government will literally throw bundles of cash from helicopters into the hands of the public? Well, not exactly. So I decided to start this edition with a chart to de-mystify some questions on helicopter money. This time I have included a very interesting chart that shows a strong correlation between spike in outward remittances and CIC. Causality or mere correlation? I don't really know. There is a chart on the divergence between bank credit to retail and corporate sectors. This divergence is a mirror image of the current recovery, which is largely consumption-driven while industry (investment) demand remains weak. There is this one chart on how under-penetrated India is when it comes to health insurance even when compared with its EM peers. A huge opportunity for health insurers. In what could be a possible risk-on resurgence, ETF flow to emerging markets has been on the rise recently. In June we saw the highest single-day ETF inflows in 27 months. Now, we very well know how finicky ETF money is. It can flee as fast as it flows in. A very interesting chart on how the current rally in the S&P is driven largely by equity risk premium compression than earnings growth or multiple expansion. Markets are putting too much faith on the ability of the central banks to drive up the markets even as quality of earnings deteriorates (-9 per cent earnings growth in this 2012-2016 rally). It's a strange world we are living in! (Ritesh Jain is the CIO of Tata Asset Management.

ETF News Best ETFs Top Rated ETFs Best ETF Categories ETF Screener Tools ETF Screener Find Whats In Your ETF Find What ETFs Hold Your Stock Find ETFs By Leverage Find ETFs By Asset Class Free Newsletter Search Investors Are Going Crazy for This High Yield ETF August 7, 2016 3:32pm NYSE:GIS NYSE:K ShareTweet We’ve been writing about it for a while, but despite the concerns of how much investors seem to be overly chasing income in the form of high yield ETFs, there is no denying investors have been right to keep pouring money in them — for now. One of the better performing ETFs in 2016 is the PowerShares High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers Portfolio ETF (NYSE:PEY), which is up over 18% year-to-date. In looking at some of the ETF’s top holdings it’s no surprise to find big telecom names like Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T), as well as tobacco plays like Altria Group (NYSE:MO) and smaller tobacco companies like Vector Group (NYSE:VGR). Sector-wise, utility stocks make up 20% of the overall ETF holdings, followed by financial services at 17%, and consumer-defensive stocks like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Kellogg (NYSE:K)and General Mills (NYSE:GIS), with that group making up 16% of the ETF’s overall holdings. This market environment’s current yield-buying frenzy focus comes as Treasury bond yields have fallen to record lows. When the obsession with yield will end is anyone’s guess. Perhaps the Federal Reserve actually raising interest rates will be the remedy to offset set what appears more and more to be a yield-chasing bubble which has resulted in record-highs in terms of valuation. We’ll certainly be keeping tabs on this ETF and plenty more like it. Here are the top 10 holdings currently in the PowerShares High Yield Equity Dividend Achievers Portfolio ETF: PEY closed at $15.82 per share on Friday, up $0.14 (+0.89%). PEY has gained 18.5% year-to-date, compared with a 7% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index.

Alts Currency-Hedged Equities Fixed-Income New ETFs Webcasts ETF Newsletter Video Podcasts ETF Strategist Channel Search You Are Here: Home → 2016 → August → Owning Passive ETF’s Doesn’t Make You Passive Owning Passive ETF’s Doesn’t Make You Passive Iris.xyz August 7, 2016 0 Comment Note: This article is courtesy of Iris.xyz By Joesph Hosler Within the investment industry, there is an ongoing debate about the efficacies of passive and active investing. Vanguard has been one of the more vocal participants in evaluating active managers and the consequences of stock-based investment strategies. Academic research into the matter confirms Vanguard’s hypothesis: Most managers that claim to be active are not consistently adding value to the market return. Each year is pronounced the year that active management will win, but this is rarely the case. Why does active management seem to be so ineffective at beating the market? The majority of the investment community attempts to add value by selecting individual stocks. Investors weigh one company or theme more than others. Investment managers spend their time searching for inefficiencies in the valuation of individual companies in order to outperform the market.  However, much like any free market, the more individuals focus on finding inefficiencies, the fewer inefficiencies there are to exploit.  It therefore comes as no surprise that the significant research staff and budgets of the largest mutual fund complexes are unable to outperform a passive collection of stocks: their size and past success has resulted in an efficient market. Is the only solution then a static allocation of passive, market-weighted investments?  No — inefficiencies will always exist.  Therefore, the plan should be to seek out inefficiencies and exploit them.  With nearly everyone fishing the same pond for individual company opportunities, it might serve investors to look for fishermen that have elected to change ponds and fish where ample opportunities exist. Research consistently shows that the two largest components to long-term investment return are market participation and asset allocation.  However, very few of the large firms focus on those factors.  Instead, they focus almost all of their attention on finding the next Google, Proctor & Gamble, or Home Depot. This issue was highlighted in a CNBC panel on October 20th, 2015 with leaders from three prominent mutual fund families.  They all promoted active management, focusing on stock selection and argued that 2015 was the year of the stock picker.  When the host asked if they ever make asset allocation calls or market participation calls, the CEO of one said they leave that decision to the client.  These three large investment firms readily admitted to leaving the two most important investment decisions to the client.

Our take: Credit to Mayor Dennis Connelly for getting talks started again. Connelly realized the mall is the town’s biggest taxpayer and is now working to get a deal done — a move that figures to result in more revenue for an area still adjusting to the closing of Fort Monmouth. It also will bring a better mall. Retail is changing dramatically. If towns don’t upgrade their malls quickly, they will lose a lot of revenue. Not so business-friendly French fragrance company Mane USA has halted its plans for a proposed manufacturing and research facility in Morris Plains, due to some public outcry from Hanover and Morris Plains residents. Our take: Small towns need to be careful feeling they can pick and choose which companies come in. The state needs jobs and industry — why turn one away? The move was announced the same week that Procter & Gamble said it will shut its facility in Woodbridge by 2018. Business-friendly (take two) Aurobindo USA has broken ground on the 567,000-square-foot facility it is building as a new U.S. headquarters in East Windsor Township, the municipality last announced week. Aurobindo, a pharmaceutical company based in India, is building a new warehouse, distribution and manufacturing center on the 90-acre site, which will generate more than 400 new jobs when up and running. Our take: Now that’s what the state needs. Each week in Face Time, NJBIZ editors approximate Chris Christie's mood and facial expressions based on the news. FACETIME:TREND SETTER Gov. Chris Christie called for the state to investigate whether Bridgegate investigative committee co-chairs Sen. Loretta Weinberg and Assemblyman John S. Wisniewski used state resources for political attacks on him. Days later, Senate President Stephen Sweeney called for an investigation of union activities (in an unrelated case). Perhaps “Probes, not Potholes” should be the new motto for Trenton.

(Photo: Enquirer file/Meg Vogel)Buy Photo A minor-league soccer team is two-thirds through its rookie season when it starts talking openly about seeking bigger pastures. Ambitious. The team is spectacularly successful. It sets league attendance records. That’s nice, but only a start. Its leaders cozy up to power brokers at the proverbial next level, suggesting they take a good, long look. Audacious. The high-ups from the bigger league actually take note of the upstart, and not disapprovingly. “Keep in touch, kid. You’ve got a shot.’’ Cincinnati? CINCINNATI.COM Buckle up, FC Cincinnati fans I don’t care if Futbol Club Cincinnati ever spends a minute playing Major League Soccer. FCC could remain in the United Soccer League from now until forever (or until the U.S. men win the World Cup, whichever comes first), and that would be OK. What’s greatest about the local side’s wooing of the MLS isn’t the possibility of moving up in class, though after two-thirds of one season of existence, that’s impressive. It’s what it represents. It’s bold. It’s visionary. It takes our town’s sometimes shaky belief in itself and slams it into a trash can. “We think we’re on the front of something special,’’ says team president and general manager Jeff Berding. “We feel strongly Cincinnati shouldn’t be left on the sidelines. Someday we’ll hopefully look back at this and be glad we didn’t lose out to other cities.’’ Buy Photo  (Photo: The Enquirer/Meg Vogel) They’ve hired a consultant. Mark McCullers is the former president of the Columbus Crew, an MLS member. McCullers offers this, when reminded it’s been barely a year since the local Futbol Club started playing: “But what a year, right? It hasn’t just been good, it’s been USL-best by a long shot. The market is credible. It’s a pro sports market. It has the culture of a pro sports town. You have a strong youth soccer community, good market demographics.’’ CINCINNATI.COM MLS should heed FC Cincinnati fever Then McCullers says this: “It’s a place that 24-34-year-olds want to live.’’ It is, isn’t it? It took a generation or so for that to be true. But the scary and fabulous truth is: We’re hip. Cincinnati is cool. FC Cincinnati is a living, growing manifestation of that. CINCINNATI.COM The cool, the class of futbol in Cincinnati Those who do the hiring at P&G, GE Aviation and Kroger must be doing back-flips. The key to any small city’s success is the young minds it’s able to hire and retain. Creative types. Eager, optimistic, smart kids who want to come to work here, or who’ve grown up here and want to stay. FC Cincinnati has bisected our town at a sweet spot in time. Millennials live, work and play Downtown. They’ve grown up loving soccer. They’ve adopted FCC. They’re bringing the rest of us along with them. McCullers says ownership is key. “The proper brains’’ is how he puts it. The Lindners didn’t get rich spending foolishly. Whether it was diligent research, keen instincts or blind luck – all three, most likely – they have tapped into a mother lode of potential. They’d like to see how far they can take it. “The Lindners are credible, they’re major-league, they fit well at the MLS ownership table,’’ McCullers says. A franchise fee of up to $200 million has been suggested. That’s a filter, insiders say, to identify the serious. A charge of $125 million is closer to reality. Berding says ownership would pay that. The soccer-only stadium isn’t a big issue, says Berding. He cites the franchises in Seattle and New England that play in NFL stadiums, and the new franchise in Atlanta, which will share a new stadium with the Falcons. Says McCullers of Nippert Stadium, “They could play MLS there tomorrow.’’ Berding hopes to get MLS officials to a game there before the year is out. Berding is also quick to say “Our immediate future is the USL and we are very comfortable with that,’’ he says. MLS expansion isn’t likely until 2020, he says. It could be an overreach. As a reader suggested to me, “I don’t see the local soccer-loving public demanding MLS so much as a good time with a winning team.’’ That could be true. Or it could be limiting. Regardless, McCullers says, “It’s hard not to have Cincinnati in the (MLS) discussion now.’’ Ownership is banking that the value of an MLS franchise will appreciate significantly over the next several years at least. As Berding puts it, “A changing sports culture has made soccer a very important sport. Twelve years ago, soccer was behind women’s figure skating in terms of public interest.’’ Those with big money invested can sweat those details. The rest of us bask in the intangibles. Pro soccer is fashionable, Cincinnati’s pro soccer market is exploding, thus Cincinnati is fashionable. And we’ve only just begun. 362 CONNECTTWEET 22 LINKEDIN 4 COMMENTEMAILMORE TOP VIDEOS Dodgers great Ralph Branca dies at 90 1:15 Top five college football games to watch in Week 13 2:20 Achieving the Dream - Charles Woodson 3:40 Statistical oddities from the NBA's first month 1:52 Why the Los Angeles Clippers are rolling 1:36 Notre Dame to vacate football wins from 2012 and 2013 1:15 Bruce Arena replaces Jurgen Klinsmann as USMNT coach 1:07 Celeb Pick 'Em with Miles Teller 3:25 How the NFL playoff picture looks after Week 11 1:37 NBA weekend in review: Clippers continue to roll 1:40 Doug Baldwin speaks out on community policing 3:32 Jurgen Klinsmann fired as USMNT coach 0:48 Week 11 NFL hot reads: Redskins building solid foundation 2:36 Jimmie Johnson wins record-tying seventh Sprint Cup title 1:00 Week 12 Amway Coaches Poll 1:14 NFL players must battle altitude and pollution in Mexico City 2:41 Numbers to know for the Chase for the Sprint Cup 1:23 Who is the favorite to win the Sprint Cup title? 1:08 What to watch for in Sprint Cup race at Homestead 1:27 Lorenzo's Locks: Week 11 NFL picks 1:59 Punting tips and dance moves with Marquette King 1:00 Reflecting on Tony Stewart's legacy in NASCAR 2:52 A timeline of Johnny Manziel’s troubled history 2:02 Fighters square off at UFC Fight Night 100 faceoffs 1:14 Mets pitcher Jeurys Familia pleads not guilty to domestic violence charge 0:50

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Neil Greenberg August 6 Follow @ngreenberg There are many ways gymnasts can medal at the Olympic games in Rio. Here's how the competition works. (Video: Jayne W. Orenstein/The Washington Post/Photo: Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) When women’s gymnastics overhauled its scoring system ahead of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, the sport that had once been all about clean execution added a new focus: risk. Eight years later, there’s one gymnast who has mastered the art of execution and whose degrees of difficulty have made her the world’s best: Simone Biles. [Meet Simone Biles, who is about to turn Olympic gymnastics upside down] The gymnastics world Biles inhabits looks very different than when the “perfect 10″ made Nadia Comaneci a household name in 1976. Two scores are now tallied to create an overall score for the gymnast. The “A” score measures the difficulty of the routine and the “B” score deducts points based on mistakes. With final scores ranging from 13 to 15 and medal-winning scores rising above 16. The tougher the routine, the higher the potential score. There’s an obvious reward for the gymnasts who choose more difficult routines. During the individual all-around competition at the 2012 London Olympics, the average score for gymnasts choosing a degree of difficulty between 5.5 and 6 was 14. For those whose degree of difficulty exceeded 6.5, the average score was 15.6. But the worst score for the tougher routine was 15.1 compared with the best score of 15.2 in the less-difficult routine. In other words: go big or go home. Because Biles consistently chooses tougher routines, The Post’s Liz Clarke writes that “barring a rare misstep, she’ll be untouchable on vault, floor and beam.”   On the vault she performs the Amanar, which earned her a 6.4 degree of difficulty — it typically carries a difficulty score of 6.3 — and a 9.9 execution score at the 2015 U.S. championships for a total of 16.3 points, narrowly beating out McKayla Maroney’s routine at the 2012 Summer Games (16.2) for highest score all-time under the new scoring format. And now that it looks like Biles will upgrade her second vault to the Cheng, a move she showed off at the 2016 Pacific Rim Championships, which is usually worth a degree of difficulty of 6.4. If a back injury doesn’t force Russian Maria Paseka from the Rio Games, she might be the biggest threat to Biles. During the 2012 Games, Paseka — who beat Biles on vault at the 2015 world championships — won bronze with difficulty ratings of 6.5 and 5.6 in her first and second vault, respectively in the final round. North Korea’s Hong Un Jong, the 2008 Olympic champion and 2014 world champion on vault, could also be a threat. In fact, Biles upgraded her second vault to a Cheng to keep pace with Hong, who used it to beat Biles in previous years. Not to be outdone, Hong has been practicing a move that has never been executed in competition by a female gymnast: the triple-twisting Yurchenko, which is the Amanar plus an extra half twist. According to NBC’s Julia Fincher, Hong has submitted the triple-twisting Yurchenko at the 2013, 2014 and 2015 world championships, but never performed it in competition. If she can pull it off, not only would it reward her with a 6.8 difficulty rating, higher than Biles’s Amanar, it would become known as the Hong vault. But the vault is Biles’s weakest event — she took two silver medals and one bronze on vault at the last three world championships — and is the only apparatus on which she didn’t dominate at those competitions. According to Slate’s Dvora Meyers, Biles “attacks her skills with vigor, especially her dismount series,” on beam, often ending with a dismount so difficult that judges are likely to forgive minor imperfections. Russia’s Aliya Mustafina, the 2010 world all-around champion, had a more difficult beam and bar routine in the 2016 Russian Cup than Biles did at the P&G Championships, but she was edged by Biles on vault and floor for a higher total difficulty score. On floor, Biles has no equal. Her signature move, aptly known as “the Biles,” is one that few, if any, gymnasts dare to perform. “She flips backward with a straight body two times, and on the second flip, she does a half turn and she lands forward,” her coach, Aimee Boorman, explained to ABC News. “So she’s going backwards. She’s like arched backwards, and she flips and then starts her second flip. And before she finishes the second flip, she turns her body.” At the P&G Championship, Biles had a 6.8 difficulty on floor in both the preliminary and final rounds. Her closest competition that day was Aly Raisman with difficulty scores of 6.7 and 6.6, respectively, in the prelims and finals. No other competitor was higher than 6.5, and nine of the 14 women in the event had at least one floor routine with a difficulty rating of less than 6. In other words, if you want to beat Biles at the Olympics, you have to create one of the most difficult routines you can think of in addition to executing it at an elite level. Since her international competition debut in 2013 — she didn’t meet the minimum-age requirements for the 2012 Summer Games  — Biles has won 14 medals at the world championships, including 10 golds, and became the first woman since 1974 to win four consecutive all-around titles at U.S. nationals. She is also the first woman to be the all-around world champion three years in a row. Next up for Biles: hoping to make history as the first woman to win five gold medals in a single Games. And based on the difficulty of her routines, she’s got a good shot. sports fancy-stats Get the top Olympics news by email Major news and analysis from Rio, delivered to your inbox as it happens. post_newsletter333 magnet-olympics2016 true endOfArticle false Please provide a valid email address.
