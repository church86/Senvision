Generate Inquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You By Conor Sen Amazon and Wal-Mart might once have existed in parallel universes, but these days they're in a price war. Both giants are now seeking to make acquisitions to compete on the other's turf. Amazon.com Inc. is going to have a significant brick-and-mortar presence. The only remaining question is when and how. Perhaps it'll be a new high-tech store created by Amazon wizardry, like Amazon Go grocery store, which was announced early this year. The company is slowly rolling out physical bookstores. But last week there were signs that Amazon could accelerate that push via an acquisition in one form or another. First was the report that Amazon considered buying Whole Foods last fall. And then over the weekend there was a report that BJ's Wholesale Club is putting itself up for sale, with Amazon showing some interest. Amazon's logic is straightforward: It wants to sell to consumers wherever consumers want to buy, and plenty of sales still happen in stores. Amazon's revenue in 2016, which includes all of its businesses, not just selling goods to consumers, was $136 billion, still barely more than a quarter of Wal-Mart's $486 billion. Whole Foods and BJ's each have annual revenue north of $10 billion. Assuming Amazon does make a big push into stores, it would be following the path blazed by Sears a century ago, when it took advantage of an expanded railroad network -- the internet of its time -- to build a catalog business that eventually led to a large physical retail presence. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is hardly the hapless dinosaur some think. Doug McMillon, who at 50 is younger than Jeff Bezos of Amazon, became the company's CEO in 2014. One of his first moves was announcing pay increases for employees in February 2015. At the time some saw it as a political move, to take heat off the company for its reputation in some circles as bad for communities and workers. When investors realized how much the wage increase would affect the company's bottom line, they crushed the stock. In 2015 Wal-Mart stock finished down 28.6 percent, one of the worst performers of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. But the wage increase showed that Wal-Mart understood something before most of its brick-and-mortar competitors did. First, the labor market was tightening, especially for lower-wage service workers, and Wal-Mart wanted to ensure it had good workers. And second, the in-store experience for shoppers had slipped, and needed to improve if Wal-Mart hoped to stabilize its business. Wal-Mart then turned to the online threat posed by Amazon and others. Last August, it bought the fast-growing e-commerce startup Jet.com for $3.3 billion. As part of the deal, Jet.com's CEO, Marc Lore, took over Wal-Mart's online operations. In his first several months in that role, Lore has made a few small acquisitions -- including ModCloth, MooseJaw and ShoeBuy. But it's the report that Wal-Mart is looking to buy online men's fashion retailer Bonobos that starts to give the company's strategy a little more clarity. Amazon might have created the most powerful and frictionless e-commerce machine in history, but it's been less successful at creating its own brands. That gives Wal-Mart an opening. Wal-Mart may be building a portfolio of online brands, for which it could then conceivably control distribution -- online, offline or both. Perhaps one day shoppers will be able to buy Bonobos in physical Wal-Mart stores, but not at any other store. Wal-Mart's ownership structure and cash flow position allow it to employ an Amazon-like patient, long-term strategy. The Walton family still owns 51 percent of the company's shares. Good luck to any activist investor trying to shake that grip. And with annual profits north of $10 billion, it can afford to make calculated acquisitions as it tweaks its online strategy. Amazon and Wal-Mart as a quasi-duopoly, both investing billions for the long term, is terrible news for the rest of the retail industry. Malls and big-box stores may be left cutting costs endlessly and squabbling over fewer and fewer retail dollars. Unless they can sell themselves to Amazon or Wal-Mart.

How Wal-Mart got a foot in the door of India's retail IMAGE: Inside a Best Price Modern Wholesale store, a joint venture of Walmart Stores Inc and Bharti Enterprises, in Punjab. Walmart India became a 100 per cent subsidiary of Walmart Stores International from January 2014. Photograph: Ajay Verma/Reuters. Walmart India is gearing up to roll out more stores from the first quarter of the next financial year, says its president and chief executive officer, Krish Iyer. On the sidelines of the graduation ceremony of the Walmart Women Entrepreneurship Development Programme, Iyer shared his views with a select group of journalists on the global retail major's various India initiatives. The Indian touch to Walmart stores When you joined in 2014, Walmart's India project was going through some turbulence. How have the past three years been in terms of what you set out to achieve? Walmart India became a 100 per cent subsidiary of Walmart Stores International from January 2014. The past three years were good. Our focus was on building a strategy for our cash-and-carry business, creating growth plans for the next few years, and setting the agenda for the right way of doing business. There was a lot of focus on compliance and (having) robust processes within the business. Overall, we have built the foundation for a pipeline of stores for future growth. We have done well in all these measures. We are ready to roll out more stores on the ground from early next year. We have 21 stores, and are on track to have 50 by 2021. As we speak, we have 16 stores in the pipeline, at various stages of development. Are you looking at presence in any state other than where you are present? Our major focus has been on states where we are already present. So, the new stores will be in Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. We are currently not looking at new states, but have been studying Karnataka with a lot of interest. A deeper penetration in existing states makes better business sense. How much of what is sold in India is being sourced from within the country? Local sourcing makes a lot of sense from economics point of view. Imports are expensive. Safely, 97 per cent of what we sell in our stores is locally procured. Locally produced goods have a lot of demand with our customers, namely the kirana stores. Has Walmart India taken any call on whether it wants to enter the food retail space (which was opened up for 100 per cent FDI last year)? It (100 per cent FDI) is a good initiative towards helping farmers double their income. It will reduce food wastage and help in development of cold storage backend. We have been evaluating the guidelines and at an appropriate time will look at that sector. How ready is Walmart India for GST from July 1? As soon as the rates are announced, we would be 100 per cent ready. The preparation is in progress. It is also important to help our partners in the whole process. Many of our partners are small and medium enterprises and regional suppliers. Helping and educating them is also an important part of the agenda. What is the idea behind Walmart Women Entrepreneurship Development Programme? Are there plans to increase the number of woman suppliers in the supply chain? The focus of the women entrepreneurship programme has been on depth and not scale. We have taken 32 women-owned businesses as part of the nine-month programme that initially started as a pilot. Strategically, it works well for Walmart India to have a pipeline of women suppliers in the ecosystem. When women become entrepreneurs, their social status in the country also goes up. We currently have around 50 women suppliers in our ecosystem -- around nine from this group are getting on board. We started in 2015 with the target of doubling the sourcing (from women suppliers) from the India market. We will launch another programme this year to take this forward. One of the researches done by Walmart in the United States a couple of years ago showed that products from women-owned business were perceived to be of higher quality by the customers. We launched a woman-owned business logo and put it on these products and the shelf. We found customers had greater liking for these products. From that point of view, supporting women-owned business is a strategic initiative and makes good business sense. As part of increasing gender diversity in India, we have been able to increase women participation at the store level to 16 per cent across all our stores. Our target is to have 25 per cent women store managers over the next five years. Would you go for Walmart or 'Agarwalmart'?

He told police that he had stabbed several people nearby and that he was high on LSD A 21-year-old man was arrested after he allegedly stabbed three people and walked naked through a Wal-Mart under the influence of LSD. Adam Presley was apprehended after police were called to the superstore on Lexington Road in Athens, Georgia, and discovered him walking the isles unclothed and covered in blood. After being tasered and physically subdued, he told medical personnel on the scene that he was under the influence of the psychedelic drug and had stabbed several people - and that 'there's nothing wrong with that,' according to police. Officers were simultaneously attending to the stabbing scene on the 400 block of Meadow Lane, just down the road from the Wal Mart, according to the Athens Banner-Herald. Three people were found in the home with stab wounds in the early hours of Saturday morning.  His three alleged victims suffered stab wounds to their abdomen, face and back.

The identities of the victims have not yet been released - though one is said to have been admitted to the intensive care unit of an Athens-Clarke County hospital. Another victim's injuries were considered 'severe,' and the condition of the third victim could not be reported. Presley was apprehended after police were called to the superstore on Lexington Road in Athens, Georgia, and discovered him walking the isles unclothed and covered in blood EMS on the scene determined that the blood on Presley was actually his own and not that of his alleged victims. Investigators found that he had smashed a car window in the parking lot outside the Wal-Mart before entering, which was the cause of his injury. According to social media, he works at the Skate Park of Athens, located across the street from Wal-Mart and the Meadow Lane crime scene. Presley faces charges of three counts of aggravated assault and one count of aggravated battery. He is being held at Clarke County Jail without bond.

Walmart India – a wholly-owned subsidiary of US-based Walmart Stores ­– is reportedly reviewing a new set of guidelines, which allow for 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) in India’s food retail sector. According to Inside Retail Asia, Walmart India president and chief executive Krish Iyer said his company had been “evaluating” the new guidelines and would look to act on the changes “at an appropriate time.”  Walmart India currently operates exclusively in the cash-and-carry wholesale space. It has over 20 stores under the Best Price Modern retail banner across the country. Walmart is not the only retailer to signal its interest under the new FDI laws. In February, ecommerce giant Amazon launched a bid to become the first wholly-owned foreign retailer to sell locally produced food items online in India. The growing level of faith international investors see in India was reflected in the 2017 AT Kearney FDI Confidence Index. The country moved up to eighth place in the index (ninth in 2016), with 70 per cent of respondents planning to maintain or increase their FDI in India over the coming years.  “India's reforms to enable a 'transparent' and an 'easy' business environment, have made it an attractive destination for foreign companies,” the AT Kearney report said.  Comments (0) Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus Sign up for free news updatesGo Popular news Read: LatestMost read 1JD.com launches flagship Zespri store 2Walmart India evaluates new FDI guidelines 3Strong start for Chilean kiwifruit 4Industry mourns passing of Russ Hanlin Sr 5Pacific Northwest prepares to host Interpera Congress 6Sun World promises better farms and flavour 7ABC chases new markets 8Cyclones batter Bay of Plenty 9Florida grapefruit volumes down 10Subscribers onlyCherries weather the drought 1Spanish port strike to go ahead 2Mindanao must endure El Niño 3Hamburg Süd tests low-sulphur fuel 4ABC chases new markets 5Garry Langford to depart APAL 6Zespri at 20: where next for NZ kiwifruit? 7Audio: brands key to adding new value 8Walmart India evaluates new FDI guidelines 9Pacific Northwest prepares to host Interpera Congress 10E-commerce pioneers to speak in Hangzhou Upcoming Events April to June 2017 Fresh Produce India MUMBAI (India) 27-28 April 2017 FPJ Live - The UK Fruit & Vegetable Congress Belfry Hotel & Resort, Birmingham (United Kingdom) 4 May 2017 European Tomato Forum Düsseldorf, Germany 1-2 June 2017  Keep informed...  Twitter  Blog  Podcasts  Video  RSS Feed  Instagram Sign up for free news updatesGo Features & Analysis Strong first half for Costa Australia’s leading fresh produce group saw pre-tax profits rise 26.6 per cent, boosted by a “solid performance” across its four core categories Online dating for fresh produce They describe themselves as the matchmakers of fresh produce – but what does this latest wave of fruit and veg e-commerce platforms offer suppliers?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 April 2017 by Military News Fight Hunger One Meal at a Time /EINPresswire.com/ — MISSION, KS–(Marketwired – Apr 18, 2017) – (Family Features) Hunger in America is much closer than you may think. With the USDA reporting that one in eight Americans struggles with hunger, including more than 13 million children, food insecurity is an issue facing families in every county across the country. Spring and summer are especially difficult. During this time, food banks face a „spring hunger gap,” when food supply is often at its lowest level. Also, during the summer when school is not in session, millions of children lose access to free and reduced-price meals. To help provide meals to people struggling with hunger, companies like Walmart have created unique campaigns like „Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” that call on the public to take action and join in the fight against hunger. The campaign takes place every spring and encourages the millions of customers who shop at its stores each week to take action by supporting the Feeding America network of food banks and the more than 46 million Americans it serves throughout the country. „The campaign is an important part of Walmart’s commitment to helping families who struggle with hunger,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation and chief sustainability officer for Walmart. „Together with our suppliers, customers and friends at Feeding America, we’re dedicated to making a positive difference in the lives of those who live and work in the communities we serve.” The „Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” campaign provides support to each of Feeding America’s 200 member food banks. The retailer’s commitment to fighting hunger can be seen through food bank programs across the country, such as those offered at the Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina in Charlotte and Feeding Tampa Bay. Feeding Tampa Bay’s Summer Meals Program provide kids with free, nutritious meals when school lets out and many lose access to free and reduced-priced meals. In addition, the Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina’s Backpack Program helps ensure kids facing hunger have access to nutritious, ready to eat or easy to prepare foods on weekends and during holidays when school lunches aren’t available. Getting involved to help fight hunger in your community may be easier than you think. Here’s what you can do: Volunteer. It doesn’t take a big time commitment to make an impact. Visit your local Feeding America food bank and ask about volunteer opportunities. Donate. If you can’t contribute time, donate food or money. Your local Feeding America food bank can always use help restocking its shelves. Spread the word. Get to know the facts about hunger and spread the word through your social media activities. The „Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” campaign relies heavily on social media to raise awareness of the issue and drive donations to Feeding America food banks across the country. To learn more about what you can do to help curb the spring hunger gap and provide meals to families facing hunger in your community, visit walmart.com/fighthunger.

FASHION How will Wal-Mart continue to grow and take on Amazon? Possible Bonobos deal is in the works Andy Dunn Kelly Taub / BFA / REX / Shutterstock / WWD Andy Dunn is said to be close to a deal to sell Bonobos to Wal-Mart. Andy Dunn is said to be close to a deal to sell Bonobos to Wal-Mart. (Kelly Taub / BFA / REX / Shutterstock / WWD) Evan Clark | WWD Bonobos founder Andy Dunn is rushing toward the fashion front line in Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s growing war with Amazon. The question is what role he will play should he get there and how he could help the brick-and-mortar mass giant extend its power into the ever-changing and higher-priced fashion scene online. Sources on Monday confirmed reports that Wal-Mart is in advanced talks to acquire Bonobos, which started as a pants-centric e-tailer and has established itself in the physical world with “guideshops” that carry no inventory. The deal could potentially be worth $300 million. The transaction is being handled by Wal-Mart’s corporate development team in Bentonville, Ark., and, if it goes through, sources expect Dunn to take on a broader role as the company lays the groundwork for a larger fashion push online. The retailer is already in the midst of an acquisition-fueled growth spurt under Marc Lore, who sold Jet.com to Wal-Mart in a $3.3 billion deal last year and is now president and chief executive officer of its e-commerce operations. Lore has been given wide latitude to build Wal-Mart’s online business into a viable Amazon competitor. That means bringing new talent and pushing more goods out into the retailer’s online ecosystem. According to web data service Scrape Hero, Wal-Mart added 600,000 new items to its e-commerce business from December to January. That’s a big jump and gave it 16.9 million stockkeeping units, ranking it as the second-largest online retailer. But there’s a very big gap between first and second place and Wal-Mart’s sku count leaves it with just 4.7 percent of Amazon’s total offering, which in January stood at 356.9 million skus. So far, Lore has bought ShoeBuy for $70 million, e-tailer Moosejaw for $51 million and the vintage-inspired ModCloth for an undisclosed sum. While those transactions might seem unusual at first glance, people who have studied Lore’s approach at Wal-Mart say they are astute deals for distressed companies that bring in market share and expertise at a good price. The push in online fashion has Wal-Mart charging into a category that Amazon has long coveted and has sought to gain ground in through deals with major brands such as Levi Strauss & Co., private label programs, influencers and even a live streaming shopping program. But fashion is just part of the broader battle for market share and online clicks between the two retail behemoths. Wal-Mart is the revenue winner in the matchup, with a $486 billion top line compared with Amazon’s product sales of $95 billion (which don’t include the full value of third-party sales). And although Wal-Mart leads in profitability too — its net earnings tallied $13.6 billion last year, far exceeding Amazon’s $2.4 billion — investors are betting heavily on the future growth of e-commerce. That’s a case of being in the right place at the right time that has helped give Amazon a market capitalization of $423 billion, nearly twice the value of all of Wal-Mart’s stock, at $222 billion. To compete, experts say Wal-Mart needs to bolster its online offering, adding skus and more price points. A larger online presence would help Wal-Mart get more of out of the dollars it spends to draw customers to its shopping platform and also take advantage of its broader infrastructure. Bonobos sells chinos for $88 and five-pocket dress pants for $118 and could attract new customers to Wal-Mart’s online business, which is still largely focused on lower-priced goods. Wal-Mart has been aggressively trying to expand its web site beyond just the core retailer to become more of a platform offering a wide range of products, from designer handbags to higher-end electronics. A look from Bonobos’ Good Sport collection. WWD A look from Bonobos’ Good Sport collection. A look from Bonobos’ Good Sport collection. (WWD) A deal for the brand would mark the biggest transaction in Lore’s buying spree so far. Bonobos is said at turns to be nearly profitable or marginally in the black with sales of more than $100 million and growing. Its revenues come in through its web site, its guide shops and Nordstrom wholesale accounts. (Nordstrom along with Accel Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners and others have pumped $127 million into the company, which like many of its peers was able to raise money at sky-high tech valuations only to have the market reset to the lower price tags typically seen in fashion. Sources said Wal-Mart would likely buy out current investors). Bonobos started working with Citi last year to raise capital and was said to be looking for a $400 million valuation. The reality seems to be south of that, the reported $300 million or even lower. “It’s one of the brands in the physical/e-commerce space that’s on the upswing,” said one source familiar with Wal-Mart’s thinking A tech source noted: “Wal-Mart has a big checkbook, but they’re also good negotiators. I wouldn’t see them doing the transaction without getting [Dunn] or someone from Bonobos to run apparel. He is someone who is very smart and has a lot of experience and would fit the bill pretty well to run an [online] apparel practice, even if it’s just men’s.” That would be a big change for Dunn, but times are changing in e-commerce. Dunn made the scene as a fashion-oriented tech entrepreneur and at one point could have been expected to turn his nose up at a deal with Wal-Mart. The same might have been said of Lore, who built one of e-commerce’s most ambitious startups in Jet, but he has now pivoted and is bringing a tech revolution to the Wal-Mart establishment. Lore is still feeling out his newfound power at Wal-Mart, going up against his old boss Jeff Bezos at Amazon and looking to give people the resources to build an e-commerce powerhouse. At the Shoptalk conference in Las Vegas last month, Lore said: “We were able to build a lot of trust early on with the [Wal-Mart] ceo Doug McMillon. It was really about empowering people and Doug and the board made a big move I think to empower me and the rest of the team and I think that really got us fired up.” Lore said Wal-Mart would focus its e-commerce acquisitions on brands that have more curated experiences and that there was big potential in the relatively high margin areas of fashion and accessories. Asked if the company would consider buying one of the more established e-commerce brands such as Stitch Fix or Rent the Runway, Lore appeared open to the idea: “I definitely would [consider it] if they were prepared to make the bold move of handing over the keys. You’ve got to hand over the keys…. That’s tough to do, but I think it would work.” Dunn appears ready to do just that. And even if he does, there’s little sign that Lore is done buying to build at Wal-Mart. And there would seem to still be room in the portfolio for a women’s line to round out the offering.

Bonobos has a ‘Guideshop’ in Seattle’s University Village. (GeekWire Photo / Taylor Soper). Walmart is reportedly in the final stages of negotiations to acquire Bonobos, an online fashion retailer aimed at helping men find clothes that fit well. According to Recode, a deal that would bring Bonobos into Walmart’s e-commerce portfolio for an undisclosed sum is in its final due diligence phase. Related: Bonobos opens Seattle store: Here’s what it’s like shopping with a beer and fashion consultant Bonobos was founded at Stanford in 2007 as an online-only men’s retailer. In 2011, the New York City-based company began opening brick-and-mortar “Guideshops” where men could get fitted for suits and other clothing and then have their items delivered to their homes a few days later. The unusual model caught the attention of Seattle-based retail giant, Nordstrom, which invested $55 million in 2014 and began carrying Bonobos items in stores. The rumored acquisition could put a feather in the caps of two Amazon competitors. Nordstrom, which has struggled in its efforts to build a digital product to compete with the e-commerce king, could see a healthy return on its investment and Walmart would secure another win in its quest to reach new customers by acquiring popular brands. That strategy is spearheaded by Marc Lore, the Jet.com founder who became Walmart’s e-commerce chief after the retail giant acquired the startup for $3.3 billion. There’s no love lost between Lore and Amazon. He’s been competing with the Seattle company for more than a decade, dating back to his time at the helm of Diapers.com. Bonobos would be the latest in a series of Walmart acquisitions spearheaded by Lore, including ModCloth, ShoeBuy, and others.

In January and March of this year, Walmart acquired footwear and women’s clothing ecommerce retailers ShoeBuy and ModCloth, respectively. Now, Walmart is said to be acquiring yet another company—menswear retail Bonobos. According to Re/code, this would be Walmart’s fourth acquisition in seven months (the company also acquired Jet.com). Ant Financial Ups MoneyGram Bid to $1.2 Billion China’s Ant Financial increased its bid for US-based payments processor MoneyGram to $1.2 billion, outdoing a competing $1 billion offer for the company from US-headquartered Euronet. Ant Financial, the financial affiliate of Alibaba, had initially offered $880 million for MoneyGram in January. The move is expected to give Ant Financial a way to target unbanked and underbanked consumers in the US. However, the acquisition is also expected to draw scrutiny from US regulators.

 Walmart in advanced talks to acquire Bonobos Stephanie Pandolph Apr. 18, 2017, 10:42 AM 848 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI Intelligence See Also Walmart and Target could beat Amazon on drone delivery Walmart discounts click-and-collect Logistics providers shift focus to small retailers This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Walmart is in advanced talks to acquire e-commerce menswear company Bonobos, according to Recode. The companies have reportedly agreed on price, and the deal will be finalized upon completion of due diligence. Walmart will likely benefit from Bonobos’ unique business model. Despite the many difficulties retailers have had with free shipping, Bonobos is reportedly profitable even with its free shipping and returns policy. The company puts an emphasis on providing its customers with the right fit, which likely lowers return rates and customer dissatisfaction. Walmart may be able to apply some of the strategies that have allowed Bonobos to be profitable with its shipping policy to its other business units. The acquisition is in line with the retail giant's latest M&A efforts, which have targeted millennial-focused companies with higher income customers than Walmart typically serves. Additionally, Walmart is bringing in new talent with these purchases as it's chosen to leave the original CEO’s in charge. As a result, Walmart can reach customers beyond its usual demographic, while benefiting from leadership with experience in e-commerce. When products are returned to a merchant, the merchant faces the costly process of either repurposing, reconditioning, or recycling the good. This multi-billion dollar problem is referred to as reverse logistics and it can cut into retailers profits by 10% to 20% every year.  This problem will be even more exacerbated by the rise of e-commerce, as customers increasingly ship back goods to the retailer, who often might pay for the shipping costs.  BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on reverse logistics that discusses how retailers can take an omnichannel approach to help reduce the costs they bear from returned goods. In particular, the report examines the strategic reasons why retailers should implement a reverse logistics function and discusses the industries that are most at risk. Here are some of the key takeaways from the report: The rise of e-commerce has increased the need for an effective reverse logistics solution. E-commerce will account for 10% of total retail sales in 2018, up from 7.8% in 2015, according to the US Census Bureau. Shoppers are more prone to returning items purchased online because they aren't sure exactly what they're getting. There are four types of returns retailers face: commercial returns, product recalls, repairable returns, and end-of-life returns. Each requires a different reverse logistics cycle to handle it effectively. Retailers can reclaim up to 32% of the total product cost by having an effective reverse logistics function. This includes by reselling the product, recycling it, remanufacturing it, and more. Retailers should take an omnichannel approach to reverse logistics. However, this will only work if the retailer has all their systems integrated and thus can track online and offline purchases in the same system.

Michael King , WXIA 6:12 PM. CDT April 17, 2017 Adam Scott Presley was arrested by Athens-Clarke County Police early Saturday morning after they said he stabbed three people while under the influence of LSD. (Athens-Clarke County PD) (Photo: WXIA) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST ATHENS, Ga. -- Early Saturday morning, Athens-Clarke County Police officers responded to a home in the 400 block of Meadow Lane in response to an aggravated assault call.  When they arrived, officers found three victims -- two male victims with stab wounds -- one to the face, a second with a wound to the back. The third victim was a female with a puncture wound in her lower right abdomen area. Investigators said 21-year-old Adam Scott Presley was under the influence and began attacking the victims with a knife, and had fled before officers arrived.  While officers were still investigating the Meadow Lane location, they received an indecent exposure call from a Walmart store on Lexington Road in Athens. When officers arrived at the Walmart, they found a nude white male inside the store. Officers said it appeared the suspect was under the influence, and had blood on him. They were able to identify him as Presley. Officers gave Presley verbal commands to stop walking, but he did not stop. They deployed their Tasers against Presley, but Presley continued to walk through the tasing.  The officers on the scene were able to get physical control of Presley and take him into custody. EMS crews were called to assess Presley's condition. It was found that he had shattered a car window before entering the Walmart store -- which is where his cut hand come from.  While EMS personnel were examining Presley, he told them he was under the influence of LSD, and admitted he had stabbed several people, saying, "There is nothing wrong with that." Police said one of the stabbing victims sustained serious injuries, and was admitted to intensive care. The condition of the other victims was not immediately available.  PHOTOS | Mug Shot Photos © 2017 WXIA-TV CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Couple kicked off United flight in Houston Houston woman files suit against United Airlines Tuesday morning forecast - 8:55 a.m. update Suspect named in 3 NE Houston shootings 4 armed robbery suspects caught after chase New casino cruise ship opens in Galveston Student accused of changing grades at Memorial HS Manhunt underway in NE Houston after neighbor shot Steve Stephens nationwide manhunt Community center plans anger Sunnyside residents More Stories President George H.W.

With the USDA reporting that one in eight Americans struggles with hunger, including more than 13 million children, food insecurity is an issue facing families in every county across the country. Spring is a particularly difficult time for families struggling with hunger because food banks across the country are also facing a time of year known as the "spring hunger gap," when food supply is often at its lowest level. To help provide meals to people struggling with hunger, companies like Walmart have created unique campaigns like "Fight Hunger. Spark Change." that call on the public to take action and join in the fight against hunger. The campaign takes place every spring and encourages the millions of customers who shop at its stores each week to take action by supporting the Feeding America network of food banks and the more than 46 million Americans it serves throughout the country. "The campaign is an important part of Walmart's commitment to helping families who struggle with hunger," said Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation and chief sustainability officer for Walmart. "Together with our suppliers, customers and friends at Feeding America, we're dedicated to making a positive difference in the lives of those who live and work in the communities we serve." The "Fight Hunger. Spark Change." campaign provides support to each of Feeding America's 200 member food banks. The retailer's commitment to fighting hunger can be seen through food bank programs across the country, such as those offered at the Philabundance food bank in Philadelphia and FeedMore in Central Virginia. The Philabundance Community Kitchen (PCK) is an adult culinary arts vocational training program that prepares low-income women and men to work in commercial kitchens. Beyond the practical results of launching more people into the workforce, Philabundance also helps provide an average of 90,000 meals every week to people facing hunger in the Delaware Valley. FeedMore is Central Virginia's core hunger-relief organization. Its Mobile Pantry program works to distribute a variety of healthy food items to underserved communities with limited access to grocery stores. The Mobile Pantry goes above and beyond to provide each household in need with about 35 pounds of perishable and non-perishable food items for each distribution. Getting involved to help fight hunger in your community may be easier than you think. Here's what you can do: Volunteer. It doesn't take a big time commitment to make an impact. Visit your local Feeding America food bank and ask about volunteer opportunities. Donate. If you can't contribute time, donate food or money. Your local Feeding America food bank can always use help restocking its shelves. Spread the word. Get to know the facts about hunger and spread the word through your social media activities. The "Fight Hunger. Spark Change." campaign relies heavily on social media to raise awareness of the issue and drive donations to Feeding America food banks across the country.

The campaign takes place every spring and encourages the millions of customers who shop at its stores each week to take action by supporting the Feeding America network of food banks and the more than 46 million Americans it serves throughout the country. „The campaign is an important part of Walmart’s commitment to helping families who struggle with hunger,” said Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Walmart Foundation and chief sustainability officer for Walmart. „Together with our suppliers, customers and friends at Feeding America, we’re dedicated to making a positive difference in the lives of those who live and work in the communities we serve.” The „Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” campaign provides support to each of Feeding America’s 200 member food banks. The retailer’s commitment to fighting hunger can be seen through food bank programs across the country, such as those offered at the Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina in Charlotte and Feeding Tampa Bay. Feeding Tampa Bay’s Summer Meals Program provide kids with free, nutritious meals when school lets out and many lose access to free and reduced-priced meals. In addition, the Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina’s Backpack Program helps ensure kids facing hunger have access to nutritious, ready to eat or easy to prepare foods on weekends and during holidays when school lunches aren’t available. Getting involved to help fight hunger in your community may be easier than you think. Here’s what you can do: Volunteer. It doesn’t take a big time commitment to make an impact. Visit your local Feeding America food bank and ask about volunteer opportunities. Donate. If you can’t contribute time, donate food or money. Your local Feeding America food bank can always use help restocking its shelves. Spread the word. Get to know the facts about hunger and spread the word through your social media activities. The „Fight Hunger. Spark Change.” campaign relies heavily on social media to raise awareness of the issue and drive donations to Feeding America food banks across the country.

With the USDA reporting that one in eight Americans struggles with hunger, including more than 13 million children, food insecurity is an issue facing families in every county across the country. Spring is a particularly difficult time for families struggling with hunger because food banks across the country are also facing a time of year known as the "spring hunger gap," when food supply is often at its lowest level. To help provide meals to people struggling with hunger, companies like Walmart have created unique campaigns like "Fight Hunger.

The retailer's commitment to fighting hunger can be seen through food bank programs across the country, such as those offered at the Philabundance food bank in Philadelphia and FeedMore in Central Virginia. The Philabundance Community Kitchen (PCK) is an adult culinary arts vocational training program that prepares low-income women and men to work in commercial kitchens. Beyond the practical results of launching more people into the workforce, Philabundance also helps provide an average of 90,000 meals every week to people facing hunger in the Delaware Valley. FeedMore is Central Virginia's core hunger-relief organization. Its Mobile Pantry program works to distribute a variety of healthy food items to underserved communities with limited access to grocery stores. The Mobile Pantry goes above and beyond to provide each household in need with about 35 pounds of perishable and non-perishable food items for each distribution.

 Walmart's possible takeover of Bonobos is infuriating some fans of the high-end menswear brand Hayley Peterson Apr. 18, 2017, 9:34 AM 11,667 facebook linkedin twitter email print An ad for Bonobos.Facebook/Bonobos Walmart is reportedly in talks to buy the high-end men's clothing retailer Bonobos, and some loyal Bonobos fans are deeply disturbed by the news. Customers have expressed their dismay on social media, calling the potential acquisition "brand suicide" and threatening to never shop at Bonobos again if it's acquired by Walmart. "Bonobos just lost a customer," one person wrote on Twitter. "I do love the stretched washed chinos but no offense, I won't go to Walmart for my clothing." Another wrote: "I know I'm not the only one who would never admit to wearing Bonobos if Walmart buys them. They have no business owning a high-end brand." Another called it an "ignominious end for Bonobos." These shoppers' visceral reactions to the news might have something to do with there being little overlap in the customers of Bonobos and those of Walmart. Bonobos sells slim-fitting casual and work clothing for men online at a price point of about $100 an item or up to $1,000 for a suit. The company markets itself to hip, young, urban, fashion-conscious men. The price range for Walmart's menswear, which appeals to a much broader audience, is closer to $10 to $30. That stark contrast is exactly why the move would make strategic sense for Walmart, according to Oliver Chen, an analyst at Cowen & Co. Facebook/Bonobos For Walmart, Bonobos offers "a brand with loyal customers, premium price points, and expertise in a differentiated niche," as well as fresh merchandising and fashion talent, Chen wrote in a research note on Monday. It gives Walmart an opportunity to enter a high-margin specialty category that would help it better compete with Amazon, he said. There would be some major benefits for Bonobos as well, assuming the brand wouldn't alienate too many customers by "selling out" to Walmart, as one shopper lamented on Twitter. "A transaction would accelerate Bonobos' scale and share ... and catapult Bonobos' brand awareness," Chen wrote. But some critics just can't make sense of the potential marriage of the companies. Here's what some people are saying on Twitter: If Walmart buys @Bonobos I'll be the first to say sayonara. Brand suicide for Bonobos #bonobos — pdot pushkin (@pdotpushkin) April 17, 2017 @Bonobos just lost a customer.

Daniel Hernandez Perez was sentenced Monday, April 17, to 45 months in prison by U.S. District Judge Janet Neff in Grand Rapids. He and Lixandra Gelaber Matos, both Cuban citizens admitted to the U.S. under parole, and Alexander Santiesteban-Criado and Yume Ubmit Martinez-Orta, Cuban citizens and lawful U.S. permanent residents, were arrested last year in Kent County. Perez and Matos - who was earlier sentenced to 46 months in federal prison - are suspected of having ties to a $300,000 fraud scheme in Texas in which gift cards, or stored-value cards, are re-encoded with stolen account numbers to make fraudulent purchases at retailers such as Walmart and Sam's Club. They were each ordered to pay $218,000 in restitution. Suspects tied to $300K credit-card scheme at Walmart, Sam's Club, FBI says Martinez-Orta was sentenced Monday to five days in prison, with credit for time served, for withholding information on a crime. She was ordered to pay $39,000 in restitution. The FBI said the defendants, who had been living in Miami, targeted Sam's Club stores in Alpine Township, Cascade Township, Holland, Lansing and Muskegon. Kent County sheriff's deputies found evidence of the scheme while investigating a disturbance last July at the Motel 6 at 4855 28th Street SE in Cascade Township. Deputy Steve Ophoff, who investigated the disturbance at the hotel, noticed wrapping for seven $200 stored-value cards in a garbage can. He obtained consent to search a room and found a credit-card reader/writer device in a suitcase, the FBI said. The device could encode stolen credit-card information onto blank or exhausted cards, which are then used to buy gift cards or merchandise. The group used 87 account numbers, under the names of Perez and two others, to make $40,167 in purchases over a four-day period in June, the FBI said. Criado awaits sentencing. Perez and Criado worked for others as they traveled using re-encoded, or "cloned" cards, to buy gift cards, Assistant U.S. Attorney Hagen Frank said in a sentencing memorandum. At first, investigators believed Perez to be a leader but eventually determined he and Criado worked at the same level, acting as shoppers at the direction of others. "Images recovered during the examination of Criado's phone corroborates this account, showing him holding bricks of $100 dollar bills, posing in front of a bed covered with $50 bills, and wearing an absurd amount of heavy gold and diamond-encrusted jewelry," Frank said. Investigators also discovered images of Criado posing with a 9mm Ruger semi-automatic pistol. The images were taken shortly before his arrest, he said. "Based on the foregoing, the Government is no longer confident that Perez was more than a functionary in the scheme, albeit an energetic functionary who had the misfortune to leave behind a trail of evidence that enabled the Government to accurately calculate the losses that he and Matos caused," Frank wrote. Based on Criado's "digital self-portraits recovered from his phone," the government intends to seek an upward variance in advisory sentencing guidelines when Criado is sentenced April 24. Perez filed a sentencing memorandum under seal. Criado, in a hand-written letter to the judge, apologized and said he regretted his involvement in the scheme. "It has been a difficult time in my life, seeing how my mother is suffering because of this. It will never happen again. I am begging you for an opportunity and I promise you won't be disappointed."

A Walmart official stated the company was “honored” to partner with the CBCF. “Diversity is core to Walmart’s success and we are always honored to partner with organizations that share our commitment to helping minority students succeed in life. The congressional internship program is a wonderful example of an initiative for African-American students that works,” said Kimberly Woodard, Walmart’s director of federal government relations and CBCF board member, in a statement. “The program’s success over the last six years has raised the bar for congressional internships and we commend the CBCF for its commitment to promoting diversity on the Hill.” According to information provided by the CBCF, Walmart has provided $2 million to support the program since 2006. Traci L. Hughes, Communications Director for the CBCF, told Politic365 in a phone interview that Walmart’s monetary support was “invaluable.” “More than 80 of our students have benefited from the internship program and clearly the training and exposure they have received served them well,” said Hughes. “Many of them have gone on to work on Capitol Hill. They’re currently earning law degrees, MBAs, and have even started their own companies.” The internship program spans a semester and CBCF says the program “… prepares participating students for careers in public service or the private sector.  As a result of Walmart’s funding, interns also receive a stipend and housing during their internships.” According to the CBCF, Walmart’s funding will also help sponsor its Semester in Washington internship program, a project formed through a partnership with the George Washington University. Former CBCF intern and Hampton University graduate Darien E. Nolin — now a financial analyst for a federal agency and MBA candidate at the Johns Hopkins University — spoke to Politic365 about the value of the CBCF’s internship programs. Nolin said that his CBCF internship afforded him an opportunity to develop more professional relationships with other interns and those working in Congress as he benefited from “… the amount of exposure that it brought and the amount of confidence it gave [him] to pursue other things.” And it appears that Nolin is among CBCF intern alums making remarkable educational and professional strides. “When you look at today’s economy and see what our former interns are doing and where they are working, it affirms the quality and reputation of our program as the best training ground for college students interested in public and civic service,” said Muriel Cooper, CBCF Senior Media Manager, in an email to Politic365. CBCF provided the following list of the CBCF’s Class of 2009 Walmart Emerging Leaders and the different educational and professional endeavors they are currently engaged in: Keith Benjamin: Legislative Associate for the Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO and co-Chair of The Young & Powerful Group DC Chapter. Dshawna Bernard: Co-President of CoverME TTT designed to assist children in low income communities throughout the nation.

Coren April 18, 2017 Fire up the fuel cells. (Dylan Martinez / REUTERS) Share Written by Michael J. Coren April 18, 2017 Amazon is fueling up on hydrogen. The online retailer agreed to buy $70 million of fuel-cell forklifts from manufacturer Plug Power this year and, if Amazon purchases another $600 million in goods and services, it has the right to acquire up to 23% of the fuel cell manufacturer. The April 5 deal escalates Amazon’s efficiency arms race with Walmart, says GTM research. The two companies are battling it out with drones, algorithmic pricing, and free shipping. Now Amazon is taking the competition to the warehouse floor. A peerless logistics operation is crucial as customers go online to do ever more of their retail shopping. Amazon’s bid on Plug Power appears to be a way to lower costs and speed up operations in warehouses where as much as 25% of the electricity bill can go to powering forklifts. Amazon plans to use fuel-cell forklifts at 11 of its fulfillment centers, and the deal suggests the companies will explore fuel-cell engine applications for its parcel trucks as well. Buying a stake in Plug Power would give Amazon a second advantage: a share of one of Walmart’s top suppliers. The Arkansas-based retailer had begun developing fuel cell technology with Plug Power in 2006, and Walmart already has hundreds (perhaps thousands) of Plug Power’s forklifts in operation. Plug Power uses hydrogen fuel cells to replace batteries on forklifts and other vehicles. Polluting diesel-powered forklifts create a health hazard indoors, and the standard alternatives in many warehouses, propane-powered (not entirely clean, but safer than diesel) or electric forklifts with lead-acid batteries, must be frequently refueled or have their batteries swapped out to recharge, respectively. Fuel cells only emit water, heat, and small amounts of hydrogen. Plug Power says its GenDrive fuel cells can refuel anywhere in two minutes, reducing downtime and eliminating the need for larger battery changing rooms. Amazon’s fuel cell ambitions are the latest salvo in a fierce ecommerce war. Walmart’s $482 billion in annual revenue still dominates the rest of the tech industry. But the growth tells a different story. Amazon has seen US e-commerce growth of about 25% per quarter since at least 2013, according to company filings. Walmart, until recently, was seeing quarterly declines in year-over-year e-commerce growth falling to as low as 7% in Q1 2016 before rising back to 20% in Q3 2016 with the acquisition of Jet.com. But that wasn’t enough to prevent Walmart’s revenue growth from sinking into negative territory in 2016. To win, Walmart will need to catch up to Amazon’s lead online. Amazon has invested heavily in its Prime program, giving members free and expedited shipping. Surveys suggest as many as half of US households are already enrolled in the $99 program. Walmart abandoned its own paid-membership version of the Prime program in January, and now offers customers similar benefits for orders over $35, a slight edge over Amazon’s $49 threshold for non-Prime members. Walmart seems to realize Amazon is setting the terms. “At this day and age, two-day shipping is table stakes, so we don’t think we should charge membership for it,” said Marc Lore, Walmart’s new US head of e-commerce on the change.   Correction: A previous version of this post stated fuel cells emit CO2. They emit only hydrogen and water vapor. This has been corrected. Most Popular The case for being grumpy at work Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

But it will be a long ride before it can stamp its products “Made in USA.” The loss of nearly one out four U.S. factories in the last two decades means parts for its bike frames and engines must be purchased in China, where the manufacturing supply chain moved years ago. “There’s just no way to source parts in America right now,” said Monster Moto Chief Executive Alex Keechle during a tour of the company’s assembly plant. “But by planting the flag here, we believe suppliers will follow.” Monster Moto’s experience is an example of the obstacles American companies face as they, along with President Donald Trump, try to rebuild American manufacturing. U.S. automakers and their suppliers, for example, have already invested billions in plants abroad and would face an expensive and time-consuming transition to buy thousands of American-made parts if President Trump’s proposed “border tax” on imported goods were to become law. When companies reshore assembly to U.S. soil – in Monster Moto’s case that took two years to find a location and negotiate support from local and state officials – they are betting their demand will create a local supply chain that currently does not exist. For now, finding U.S.-based suppliers “remains one of the top challenges across our supplier base,” said Cindi Marsiglio, Wal-Mart Stores Inc.’s vice president for U.S. manufacturing and sourcing. Wal-Mart partnered with Monster Moto and several other U.S. companies in a drive to increase spending on American-made goods by $250 billion by 2023 in response to consumer demand for American-made goods. Their experience has shown Americans’ patriotic shopping habits have limits, namely when it comes to price. Take Monster Moto’s bikes, which sell for between $249 to $749. Keechle, the CEO, says he can’t raise those prices for fear his price sensitive prospective customers will turn to less expensive rivals made in China. “Consumers won’t give you a free pass just because you put ‘Made in USA’ on the box,” Keechle says. “You have to remain price competitive.” Keeping a sharp eye on labor costs in their factory is one thing these U.S. manufactures can control. They see replacing primarily lower-skilled workers on the assembly line with robots on American factory floors as the only way to produce here in a financially viable, cost-competitive way. It’s a trend that runs against the narrative candidate Donald Trump used to win the presidency. Since taking office, Trump has continued promises to resurrect U.S. manufacturing’s bygone glory days and bring back millions of jobs. On March 31, Trump directed his administration to clamp down on countries that abuse trade rules in a bid to end to the “theft of American prosperity.” But it’s more complicated on the ground for companies like Monster Moto. “It’s almost as if people think you can just unplug manufacturing in one part of the world and plug it in to the U.S. and everything’s going to be fine,” said David Abney, Chief Executive Officer of package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc., which helped Monster Moto reconfigure its supply chain to bring its Chinese-made parts to Ruston. “It’s not something that happens overnight,” he said. A White House official said that the Trump administration’s efforts to encourage manufacturers to reshore production will be focused on cutting regulations and programs to provide new skills to manufacturing workers. “We recognize that the manufacturing jobs that come back to America might not all look like the ones that left,” a White House official said, “and we are taking steps to ensure that the American workforce is ready for that.” In Monster Moto’s cavernous warehouse in Ruston, boxes of imported parts that are delivered at one end then become bikes on a short but industrious assembly line of a few dozen workers. A solitary, long-bearded worker by the name of Billy Mahaffey fires up the bikes to test their engine and brakes before a small group of workers puts them in boxes declaring: “Assembled in the USA.” Helped by that label, Monster Moto has experienced a recent boom in demand from major customers that include Wal-Mart. The company expects to double production to 80,000 units and increase its assembly workers — who make $13 to $15 an hour — to 100 from around 40 in 2017. The most likely components Monster Moto could produce in America first are black, welded-metal frames for bikes and go-karts, but they would have to automate production because human welders would be too expensive. “We can’t just blow up our cost structure,” said Monster Moto President Rick Sukkar. “The only way to make it work in America is with robotics.” The same principle applies for much larger manufacturers, such as automotive supplier Delphi Automotive PLC’s. Chief Financial Officer Joe Massaro told analysts in February that 90 percent of the company’s hourly workforce is in “best-cost countries.” When asked about shifting production to the United States from Mexico, Massaro said depending on what happens to trade rules “it would have to be much more of the sort of the automated type manufacturing operations just given … the labor differential there.” That trend is already showing up in data compiled by Economic Policy Institute, a Washington-based think-tank. According to senior economist Rob Scott, not only did America lose 85,000 factories, or 23.5 percent of the total, from 1997 to 2014, but the average number of workers in a U.S. factory declined 14 percent to 44 in 2014 from 1997. According to Scott, much of the decline in workers was due to automation. “We’re going to see more automation in this country because it makes good sense economically for every company,” said Hal Sirkin, a managing director at the Boston Consulting Group. “You can spend a lot of time bemoaning it, but that’s not going to change.” Manufacturers say automated production requires fewer, but more skilled workers such as robot programmers and operators. The National Association of Manufacturers estimates because of the “skills gap” there are 350,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs today in a sector that employs over 12 million people. In Ruston, Mayor Ronny Walker bet on Monster Moto by guaranteeing the company’s lease because he wants to diversify the city’s economy, and envisions suppliers setting up alongside Monster Moto’s assembly plant. “Could it take a long time to bring manufacturing back here? Sure,” he says. “But you have to start somewhere.”   SEE COMMENTS → News Blogs Living Sports Opinion Reward posted in search for Bangor homicide suspect Ohio Street shooting victim dies Man charged with photographing, sharing picture of two young girls ‘It was really upsetting:’ Bangor mixed martial arts gym homeless after building sale Don’t expect to see lighthouses in this new TV show about Maine New poll shows that fewer and fewer people believe Trump’s lies Fox network’s response to sexual harassment reports sends chilling message to victims My job as a physician is to alleviate suffering, not cause death Democrats’ budget plan offers lawmakers a chance to show voters they’re listening Restaurant workers can tell you governing by referendum has consequences ‘It was really upsetting:’ Bangor mixed martial arts gym homeless after building sale Scarborough man, North Yarmouth woman top Maine finishers at Boston Marathon Old Town opens baseball title defense by beating Orono UMaine ties that bind: Former basketball standout savors NBA grind Wright, Benintendi lift Red Sox past Rays STATE & CAPITOL LePage: One school superintendent per county would still be too many POLLWAYS How I just missed becoming a widow GEORGE'S OUTDOOR NEWS Deer feeding, baiting, antler restrictions, and more debated at legislature THE BDN BUZZ This bank will take cheese as collateral for a loan #MAINE The Chainsmokers are more popular than ever, but not with music critics Don’t expect to see lighthouses in this new TV show about Maine Two Maine teachers get national recognition for nature-based teaching methods ‘It’s a part of life here’: Down East smelt fry a celebration of spring, local foods Strange and Delicious Vegetable Condiment Allan Holdsworth, progressive guitar virtuoso, dies at 70 Blogs Be a BDN blogger | Browse BDN blogs Opportunity Knocks Introducing Opportunity Knocks to the BDN blog network Introducing Opportunity Knocks to the BDN blog network The Day Job What keeps you up at night?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 18 April 2017 | MYT 5:30 PM Wal-Mart seeks online fashion presence through acquisitions In its push for a bigger online presence, Wal-Mart so far has bought ShoeBuy, which specialises in footwear and apparel; Moosejaw, which sells outdoor wear; and ModCloth, an online seller of women's clothing. — Reuters Wal-Mart Stores Inc's bid for clothing retailer Bonobos, which surfaced last week, is the latest step in the company's attempt to recover lost ground against Amazon.com Inc and others in the rapidly growing online fashion world, analysts and retail consultants said.  If Wal-Mart succeeds, the move into fashion also would advance its effort to access younger, millennial customers who usually do not shop on Walmart.com.  A Bonobos deal would mark the company's fourth acquisition of a small online clothing-and-accessories brand since the start of 2017. The bid was first reported by Recode on Friday. Wal-Mart has declined to comment.  The move is in keeping with an online strategy led by Marc Lore, the founder and former chief executive of internet retailer Jet.com, who took over Wal-Mart's e-commerce business in August, after Wal-Mart paid US$3.3bil (RM14.55bil) for Jet.  Wal-Mart is the world's largest brick-and-mortar clothing retailer, with 2016 sales exceeding US$23bil (RM101.44bil), according to retail think tank Fung Global Retail & Technology.  But despite its traditional muscle, the Bentonville, Arkansas, company has been unable to replicate that success online. It has not only struggled to attract the type of affluent young consumers who tend to shop for clothes online but has also faced challenges in persuading well-known apparel brands to sell on its website.  Wal-Mart's online sales account for only about 3% of total sales, the company has said. In the second half of this year, it is targeting online sales growth of 20 to 30%.  In its push for a bigger online presence, Wal-Mart so far has bought ShoeBuy, which specialises in footwear and apparel; Moosejaw, which sells outdoor wear; and ModCloth, an online seller of women's clothing. In March, Lore said at an industry event that Wal-Mart will make more acquisitions to expand its business rapidly.  Jan Rogers Kniffen, chief executive of retail consultancy J. Rogers Kniffen WWE, said the deals could begin to add up, though so far they are too small to have a material impact on Wal-Mart. "It gives them a totally separate vehicle to grow with fashion brands and to own fashion brands," he said.  Wal-Mart's move also aims to stem the loss of market share to Amazon in the highly competitive fashion sector. Amazon leads the US online clothing and footwear market with sales of US$13bil (RM57.33bil) in 2016, up US$9bil (RM39.69bil) from five years ago.  It is expected to triple its share of the US apparel market over the next four years, according to data from Euromonitor and Forrester.  Macy's Inc, Nordstrom Inc, Gap Inc, Kohl's Corp, L Brands Inc and J.C. Penney Co Inc also compete in the segment.  Howard Davidowitz, chairman of retail consulting and investment banking firm Davidowitz & Associates Inc, said Wal-Mart's prior efforts to buy market share through acquisitions have not succeeded. "They have been involved with this strategy for a long time. How has it done? Terribly," Davidowitz said. "Marc Lore has continued this strategy." Lore did not respond to a request for comment.  Wal-Mart has been investing in e-commerce for the past 15 years, but it still lags far behind Amazon. In the five years before the Jet.com deal, Wal-Mart acquired more than 15 startups.  The company has not disclosed what it spent on each deal, but said in January it had spent a total of US$3.1bil (RM13.67bil) on e-commerce and digital projects in its prior four fiscal years. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Technology , Analyst Reports Related Stories You May Be Interested Google Earth re-invented for new era Czech court bars Uber in country’s second-largest city Police break up WhatsApp child porn image sharing network Facebook pushes to augment reality through smartphones How to own your first home with zero down payment Pedalling to save the planet Others Also Read New Stylo China showroom set to link buyers and designers Top cop: Many massage parlours are fronts for vice activities Bayern left fuming over Champions League 'robbery' advertisement Latest News Yahoo's first-quarter revenue jumps 22% Hays: Malaysia’s banking sector on recruitment spree China urges Canada to relax curbs on high-tech exports: Xinhua Facebook Messenger doubles down on bots, after slow start Eco World inks MoUs with Brainy Bunch International Islamic Montessori Most Viewed in Tech Police break up WhatsApp child porn image sharing network PayPal and Google get cosy with new digital wallet partnership Suspect in Facebook video murder kills self in Pennsylvania: police Daimler says in talks with Didi, others for potential cooperation Apple readies iPhone overhaul for smartphone’s 10th anniversary Samsung Galaxy S8: Super 8 Czech court bars Uber in country’s second-largest city Netflix shares on track for worst day in five months Robotic software sweeping large accounting firms and clients Don’t worry, driverless cars are learning from Grand Theft Auto Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)
Financial News View Tackling the insecurity of inequality Global inequality is having knock-on effects and tackling it is now a matter of survival Rob Walton, part of the family that owns Walmart and more wealth than the bottom 42% of the US population Getty Images By Kaushik Basu April 18, 2017 Updated: 7:15 a.m. GMT Global inequality today is at a level last seen in the late 19th century – and it is continuing to rise. With it has come a surging sense of disenfranchisement that has fuelled alienation and anger, and even bred nationalism and xenophobia. As people struggle to hold on to their shrinking share of the pie, their anxiety has created a political opening for opportunistic populists, shaking the world order in the process. The gap between rich and poor nowadays is mind-boggling. Oxfam has observed that the world’s eight richest people now own as much wealth as the poorest 3.6 billion. As US Senator Bernie Sanders recently pointed out, the Walton family, which owns Walmart, now owns more wealth than the bottom 42% of the US population. I can offer my own jarring comparison. Using Credit Suisse’s wealth database, I found that the total wealth of the world’s three richest people exceeds that of all the people in three countries – Angola, Burkina Faso, and the Democratic Republic of Congo – which together have a population of 122 million. To be sure, great progress on reducing extreme poverty – defined as consumption of less than $1.90 per day – has been achieved in recent decades. In 1981, 42% of the world’s population lived in extreme poverty. By 2013 – the last year for which we have comprehensive data – that share had dropped to below 11%. Piecemeal evidence suggests that extreme poverty now stands just above 9%. That is certainly something to celebrate. But our work is far from finished. And, contrary to popular belief, that work must not be confined to the developing world. As Angus Deaton recently pointed out, extreme poverty remains a serious problem in rich countries, too. “Several million Americans – black, white, and Hispanic – now live in households with per capita income of less than $2 per day,” he points out. Given the much higher cost of living (including shelter), he notes, such an income can pose an even greater challenge in a country like the US than it does in, say, India. This constraint is apparent in New York City, where the number of known homeless people has risen from 31,000 in 2002 to 63,000 today. (The true figure, including those who have never used shelters, is about 5% higher.) This trend has coincided with a steep rise in the price of housing: over the last decade, rents have been rising more than three times as fast as wages. Ironically, the wealthy pay less, per unit, for many goods and services. A stark example is flying. Thanks to frequent flier programmes, wealthy travellers pay less for each mile they fly. While this makes sense for airlines, which want to foster loyalty among frequent fliers, it represents yet another way in which wealth is rewarded in the marketplace. This phenomenon is also apparent in poor economies. A study of Indian villages showed that the poor face systematic price discrimination, exacerbating inequality. In fact, correcting for differences in prices paid by the rich and the poor improves the Gini coefficient (a common measure of inequality) by 12-23%.

To name one seemingly trivial example, I can’t remember when I last bought a pen. They often simply appear on my desk, unintentionally left behind by people who stopped by my office. They vanish just as often, as people inadvertently pick them up. The late Khushwant Singh, a renowned Indian journalist, once said that he attended conferences only to stock up on pens and paper. A non-trivial example is taxation. Rather than paying the most in taxes, the wealthiest people are often able to take advantage of loopholes and deductions that are not available to those earning less. Without having to break any rules, the wealthy receive what amount to subsidies, which would have a far larger positive impact if they were allocated to the poorest people. Beyond these concrete inequities, there are less obvious – but equally damaging – imbalances. In any situation where, legally, one’s rights are not enforced or even specified, the outcome will probably depend on custom, which is heavily skewed in favour of the rich. Wealthy citizens can not only vote; they can influence elections through donations and other means. In this sense, excessive wealth inequality can undermine democracy. Of course, in any well-run economy, a certain amount of inequality is inevitable and even needed, to create incentives and power the economy. But, nowadays, disparities of income and wealth have become so extreme and entrenched that they cross generations, with family wealth and inheritance having a far greater impact on one’s economic prospects than talent and hard work. And it works both ways: just as children from wealthy families are significantly more likely to be wealthy in adulthood, children of, say, former child labourers are more likely to work during their childhood. None of this is any individual’s fault. Many wealthy citizens have contributed to society and played by the rules. The problem is that the rules are often skewed in their favour. In other words, income inequality stems from systemic flaws. In our globalised world, inequality cannot be left to markets and local communities to solve any more than climate change can. As the consequences of rising domestic inequality feed through to geopolitics, eroding stability, the need to devise new rules, re-distribution systems, and even global agreements is no longer a matter of morals; increasingly, it is a matter of survival.

When he was mayor, Michael Bloomberg supported Walmart’s efforts to open a store in New York, but the company faced unremitting resistance from unions and elected officials, and it gave up the fight once de Blasio moved into Gracie Mansion. “I have been adamant that I don’t think Walmart — the company, the stores — belong in New York City,” de Blasio said. Walmart’s benefits are obvious to shoppers and to economists like Jason Furman, who served in the Clinton administration and was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama. In a paper, “Walmart: A Progressive Success Story,” Furman cited estimates that Walmart, by driving down prices, saved the typical American family more than $2,300 annually. That was about the same amount that a family on food stamps then received from the federal government. More On: walmart At this Wal-mart brawl, prices and bodies were dropping Professor sues Walmart over 'toilet cleaner' on fishing license Walmart is slashing online prices with in-store pickup Decomposing dead bat found in packaged salad How could any progressive with a conscience oppose an organization that confers such benefits? How could de Blasio and the council effectively take money out of the pockets of the poorest families in New York? Because, though they would deny it, they care a lot more about pleasing powerful labor interests, especially the United Food and Commercial Workers, which helped lead the long fight to keep Walmart out of the five boroughs. Labor activists have been spreading horror stories for more than a decade about Walmart’s purported mistreatment of workers, yet somehow they haven’t dissuaded thousands of people in other cities from lining up for jobs whenever a Walmart opens. Often there are five or 10 applicants for each job. As the economist Richard Vedder has noted, the pay at Walmart is comparable with that of other large retailers. Some argue that Walmart exerts downward pressure on retail wages, but even if that’s true — and it’s debatable — the effect is tiny compared with the savings at the cash register. According to Furman, Walmart lowered American retail workers’ pay by less than $5 billion while saving shoppers more than $250 billion with lower prices. Anti-Walmart agitators complain about the government subsidies that some of the company’s workers receive for health insurance, which, they argue, burden taxpayers. But these are the same Medicaid subsidies available to low-income workers at other stores and in other industries. It makes zero sense to single out Walmart employees, as the state of Maryland did with a law (eventually struck down in court) forcing Walmart alone to forgo government subsidies and shoulder these costs by itself. If the activists succeed in their quest to transfer these health-care costs to Walmart, they’ll be striking yet another blow against the poor. When low-income workers receive subsidized health insurance through Medicaid, the money comes out of general tax revenue — paid mainly by upper-income taxpayers. If Walmart becomes responsible for paying for its own subsidies, the company might offset the expense by reducing its workers’ cash wages. Or it might raise prices, which would effectively be a new regressive tax hitting its low-income customers hardest. Either way, the burden would shift from affluent taxpayers to the working poor. These Robin Hood-in-reverse effects prompted Furman to reject his fellow Democrats’ campaign against Walmart. “The collateral damage,” Furman wrote, “from these efforts to get Walmart to raise its wages and benefits is way too enormous and damaging to working people and the economy more broadly for me to sit by idly and sing ‘Kum-Ba-Ya’ in the interests of progressive harmony.” De Blasio and the council keep spouting these irrational arguments, but they haven’t persuaded the public. In a 2015 Quinnipiac poll asking whether Walmart stores should be allowed to open, New Yorkers favored Walmart 2 to 1. But so far, their feelings don’t seem to matter to de Blasio and his fellow progressives on the council. After all, as long as shoppers go on paying higher prices at unionized stores, some of their money will keep flowing to the mayor and his allies in the form of campaign contributions. To progressive politicians, that’s the ultimate in social justice. From the Manhattan Institute’s City Journal.

Ellis Bradley, 25, was arrested at Travis Air Force Base’s main gate after police got information that he was at the base. Security forces located and detained him at his vehicle the main gate until Suisun police could arrive to take him into custody. Bradley was booked on suspicion of attempted armed robbery, carrying a firearm in commission of a felony, carrying a concealed weapon in a vehicle, use of a personal firearm and carrying a firearm while not the owner, according to Solano County jail records. His bail was set at $88,333. Police suspect that Bradley entered the Suisun City Walmart at about 1 p.m. Monday and went to the money center, where he passed the teller a note indicating he had a firearm and demanded money, according to police. The suspect exposed his waistband and displayed a firearm. The teller was unable to unlock the drawer and Bradley left. Around the same time Bradley was in the store, a police officer was flagged down by a person who pointed out a suspicious vehicle in the parking lot. The officer waited near the vehicle until the owner walked to it. That turned out to be Bradley, who also identified himself as an active-duty member of the Navy. After identifying the man and the vehicle, the officer concluded the contact. Walmart officials called the police about 13 minutes later and reported the attempted robbery. Officers responded, reviewed video surveillance footage and recognized the suspect as Bradley. Based upon identifying information they obtained on that contact, officers began the hunt for Bradley. That hunt ended at Travis Air Force Base. After Bradley’s arrest, police said a search of his car and a Brookside Drive residence uncovered a loaded firearm along with items that allegedly link Bradley to the attempted robbery at Walmart. Anyone with additional information about the case is asked to call Suisun City Police Department Investigations at 421-7361. Information can be reported anonymously to Solano CrimeStoppers at 644-7867. Reach Ian Thompson at 427-6976 or [email protected] . Follow him on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ithompsondr.

Thanks, TC Team Disrupt NYThe Action-Packed Agenda For Disrupt NY Is Live Save $1000 On Tickets Now A low-flying pet supplies company just sold to PetSmart in the biggest e-commerce sale ever Posted 1 hour ago by Connie Loizos (@cookie) 0 SHARES Next Story Baidu is making its self-driving car platform freely available to the automotive industry If you haven’t heard of Chewy, you aren’t alone. But PetSmart, the retail giant with more than 1,500 stores across the U.S., has clearly been tracking the low-flying, five-year-old pet supplies company. According to Recode, it just agreed to purchase its young rival for a stunning $3.35 billion, just slightly more than Walmart paid for Jet.com last year. This editor only heard of Chewy for the first time last fall, when talking with one of its earlier investors, Larry Cheng of the Boston-based growth equity fund Volition Capital; Volition had written Chewy its $15 million Series A check in 2013, and the company had been growing quietly like a weed, he’d told me. By design, that began to change late last year, when Bloomberg wrote a long profile about the Dania, Fla., company and the $236 million it had subsequently raised from investors, including BlackRock and New Horizon, the venture arm of mutual fund T. Rowe Price. Until then, said its chairman, billionaire e-commerce veteran Mark Vadon, his advice to the team had been to keep a low profile to better to avoid competition. It was something of a feat. By the time Bloomberg published its story, the company had more than 3,000 employees and more than $880 million in annual revenue. Its apparent key to success: personalization, from writing customers hand-written thank you and holiday cards to dedicating roughly one-sixth of its employees to customer service so pet owners’ questions could be answered quickly. Free shipping on orders over $49 also helped. Perhaps as a result, the company hadn’t yet reached profitability, Bloomberg noted, but no matter. By the time its report was published, Chewy was reportedly talking with Goldman Sachs about preparing an IPO this year. No doubt Walmart and Amazon were following its moves, too. A January profile in Forbes reported that Chewy controls 43 percent of the online sales of pet food and litter in the U.S., just behind Amazon’s 48 percent. Yet it turns out Chewy’s traction proved the most irresistible to PetSmart, and no wonder. PetSmart was taken private for $8.7 billion in 2014 by the private equity firm BC Partners, and as part of an overhauled designed to fuel its future growth, the company has been shifting more of its business online. Indeed, in a statement today, PetSmart CEO Michael Massey said of the deal, “Chewy’s high-touch customer e-commerce service model and culture centered around a love of pets is the ideal complement to PetSmart’s store footprint and diverse offerings.” The acquisition is expected to close by the end of PetSmart’s second fiscal quarter of 2017. Chewy cofounder and CEO, Ryan Cohen — who dropped out of college in Montreal to become an entrepreneur — will continue to lead Chewy as an independent subsidiary of the company. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Facebook Launches Camera Effects Platform | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Popular Posts Featured Stories Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ review VIDEO | 2:21 | Reviews Facebook announces React Fiber, a rewrite of its React framework 11 hours ago | Frederic Lardinois Audi’s latest concept is a new all-electric Tesla Model X competitor 11 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Zuck says copying Snapchat was just step 1 of Facebook’s AR platform 13 hours ago | Josh Constine Facebook launches augmented reality Camera Effects developer platform 13 hours ago | Josh Constine Latest From TechCrunch Baidu is making its self-driving car platform freely available to the automotive industry 2 hours ago | Jon Russell Instagram on Android gets offline mode 6 hours ago | Josh Constine Facebook open sources Caffe2, its flexible deep learning framework of choice 6 hours ago | John Mannes Crunch Report | Facebook Launches Camera Effects Platform 6 hours ago | Anthony Ha Comment moderation powered by Up Next Baidu is making its self-driving car platform freely available to the automotive industry Posted 2 hours ago CrunchBoard Job Listings DevOps.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Wednesday, 19 April 2017 | MYT 8:30 AM Robots may help build your next home and fill the labour gap US homebuilders are turning to automation and robots to deal with the acute labour shortage. — AFP The future of US homebuilding depends on more people like Cyndicy Yarborough, a 26-year-old former Wal-Mart clerk with no background in construction.  At Blueprint Robotics in Baltimore, she works in a factory that builds houses like cars, on an assembly line, using robots that fire thousands of nails into studs each day and never miss. Yarborough operates a machine that lifts floors and walls and packs them onto a flatbed truck, the final step before delivery to a development site where they’ll be pieced together.  “I like being a part of something new, on the cutting edge,” said Yarborough, a single mother who took the job at Blueprint last May.  For all the concern over automation removing jobs from the workforce, companies like Blueprint are actually helping to ease a labour shortage that has crimped construction of residences and commercial properties across the country. The plants enable developers to fill the gap by having houses and apartment buildings manufactured off-site, for less money and in a fraction of the time. Even Marriott International Inc, the world’s biggest hotel operator, is increasingly turning to modular construction for some of its properties.  Giant Legos  To meet growing demand, high-tech plants are opening, and older factories that were shuttered after the last decade’s real estate crash – many in areas such as rural Pennsylvania, where labour costs are cheap – are being revived. Builders hire the factories to manufacture homes in sections, which are transported on trucks, then laid down on foundations by cranes, like giant Legos. Sometimes the modules are fully framed rooms, complete with tile showers and gourmet kitchens.  “This has to be the wave of the future – I don’t know how we solve the labor shortage otherwise,” said John Burns, an Irvine, California-based homebuilding consultant. “What drives modular construction is the ability to build the house more cost-effectively.”  US homebuilders say the labour crunch is their biggest challenge, and that it’s pushing costs up as much as 5.2% on average over 12 months, according to National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo surveys last year. President Donald Trump’s proposals to crack down on undocumented workers may further squeeze the industry, one heavily dependent on immigrant labor.  Confidence among US homebuilders cooled in April after jumping a month earlier to the highest level since mid-2005, according to data released Monday by the National Association of Home Builders and Wells Fargo.  The idea of transporting homes in prefabricated sections has roots in the early 1900s, when homesteaders could buy kits from a Sears, Roebuck & Co catalogue for assembly on their newly acquired plots of land. In the 1980s and 1990s, it became increasingly popular to build lower-cost homes in factories, according to Gary Fleisher, who runs a blog for the industry called Modularhomecoach.com.  Mansions, dorms  Today’s plants are capable of producing bigger buildings with more elaborate designs. The Blueprint factory in Baltimore is one of the first in the US to use robots, Fleisher said. Taller multifamily buildings, dorms and hotels are increasingly being manufactured indoors. And so are mansions that sell for millions.  “Some builders won’t even advertise they work with modular companies like us,” said Myles Biggs, general manager of Ritz-Craft Corp’s Pennsylvania construction facility. “You could be driving past a modular home and not even know it, because it looks just like one next door.”  Ritz-Craft can deliver a single-family house in six to eight weeks, on average. Having an indoor facility means weather delays are rarely a factor. Each worker is given a narrow concentration, like tiling floors or sanding drywall, which increases production speed. People without any background in construction can become skilled laborers in two weeks, according to Biggs.  Marriott’s plans  The idea is catching on with Marriott, which aims to have agreements with North American developers this year to produce about 50 of its Select branded hotels in factories, said Karim Khalifa, senior vice president of global design strategies. In December, Marriott opened a Fairfield Inn in Folsom, California, with 97 rooms – all built at a Guerdon Enterprises LLC plant in Boise, Idaho.  Last month, a collection of Marriott hotel rooms was getting wood-framed walls and ceilings at a Champion Homes factory in Liverpool, Pennsylvania. Even the beds and televisions will be in place before the boxes are shipped through stretches of highway and stacked in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, next month.  “What we like is how well modular is built,” Khalifa said. “These things have all been designed to be transported. They have the integrity of a shipping container.”  Apartment developers, too, are increasingly going with modular construction, especially in fast-growing cities such as Denver and Nashville, Tennessee, said Rich Rozycki, head of Champion Homes’ commercial division, which has seen its pipeline grow 50 percent since 2014. The company also has had discussions with national homebuilders looking for a solution to their labor problems, he said.  Cheaper labour  Labor costs are more favorable for factory construction, according to David Reed, vice president of Champion’s modular division. Workers make about US$15 (RM66) to US$20 (RM88) an hour in rural Pennsylvania. That compares with US$50 (RM220) to US$100 (RM440) an hour in the markets the manufacturers serve, like New York’s Hudson Valley, and the Washington, D.C., area, Reed said.  Builder Kris Megna works with Champion to create houses as large as 10,000 square feet (930 square meters) in the pricey suburbs of Boston. Megna, 31, who founded Dreamline Modular Homes in 2010, said almost any custom design is possible, even though the modules can’t be much bigger than 60 feet by 16 feet (18 meters by 5 meters). Walls between sections can be knocked down for open-concept kitchens, and cutouts can create vaulted ceilings, he said.  “The house is 60% complete when it arrives, and that means 60% of the headaches of building are gone,” Megna said.  Industry stigma  For less-expensive homes with smaller margins for developers, transportation costs can eat up the savings of going modular. Federal restrictions also limit the size of each box, or section of home being moved, which can mean more on-site construction. There’s also the stigma, modular manufacturers say, that connects them to the industry’s oldest relative.  “Often when we exhibit a model home at trade shows, I will hear comments like 'This is nice for a trailer,’” said Biggs of Ritz-Craft. “Our homes are far from it, and in many ways higher-quality than those built on site.”  There doesn’t seem to be any stigma for customers of Connecticut Valley Homes, a builder that assembles factory-made components on lots in New England, including near the stately mansions of Greenwich. The East Lyme-based firm is “booming at moment,” with deposits for 42 houses, up about 50% from the same time last year, said Dave Cooper, senior building consultant. The company built only eight homes in 2011, when the housing market was hitting bottom.  “Coming out of the recession, the labour pool is just lacking,” Cooper said. “Kids are not going to construction trade school any more – they’re all playing on their computers.”  Blueprint’s robots  That isn’t necessarily a problem for Jerry Smalley, chief executive officer of Blueprint, the Baltimore factory. He’s even taking well-trained electricians and plumbers with decades of experience and putting them in front of computer screens. The company’s German-made robots are more precise than humans could ever be, using techniques that Western Europeans have employed for years, according to Smalley.  “Robots cut the hole,” he said. “But somebody still has to put the electrical box and pipes in the right places.”  Instead of displacing workers – a usual side effect of automation – Blueprint’s machines are creating opportunities for people like Yarborough, who wouldn’t otherwise be a part of the homebuilding industry. On the factory floors, 29 production workers are operating machines that cut, sand, drill and insulate. A milling centre with several different options for blades, caged in safety glass, gets to work after an employee – no hard hat needed – uploads a file that tells it exactly what to do.  Yarborough said she’s not interested in learning more about traditional construction. Before joining Blueprint, she took a free, six-month course on computer numerical control machines, available only to unemployed or low-income adults.  “I’m more interested in the engineering side,” she said, adding that she’d like to be a part of the team that generates the design maps used by robots on the factory floor. “I want to end up upstairs.” — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Google Earth re-invented for new era Czech court bars Uber in country’s second-largest city Police break up WhatsApp child porn image sharing network Facebook pushes to augment reality through smartphones How to own your first home with zero down payment Pedalling to save the planet Others Also Read New Stylo China showroom set to link buyers and designers Top cop: Many massage parlours are fronts for vice activities Bayern left fuming over Champions League 'robbery' advertisement Latest News Yahoo's first-quarter revenue jumps 22% China urges Canada to relax curbs on high-tech exports: Xinhua Facebook Messenger doubles down on bots, after slow start Netflix shares on track for worst day in five months Daimler says in talks with Didi, others for potential cooperation Most Viewed in Tech Police break up WhatsApp child porn image sharing network PayPal and Google get cosy with new digital wallet partnership Suspect in Facebook video murder kills self in Pennsylvania: police Daimler says in talks with Didi, others for potential cooperation Apple readies iPhone overhaul for smartphone’s 10th anniversary Samsung Galaxy S8: Super 8 Czech court bars Uber in country’s second-largest city Netflix shares on track for worst day in five months Robotic software sweeping large accounting firms and clients Don’t worry, driverless cars are learning from Grand Theft Auto Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Read More MUMBAI: Procter & Gamble (P&G), the world's biggest consumer goods company, has tied up with Future Group for joint sales forecasting and planning, exclusive product releases and the companies will embed officials from each at the headquarters and be part of supplychain initiatives. The two companies have met nearly four times over the year in India and the global headquarters of P&G at Cincinnati to take their association beyond the retailer-client relationship. P&G's global CEO David Taylor is currently in India for the MoU, which will be akin to the one it has with Walmart in the US. ET first reported on their likely alliance last year in October. "It will help us to grow sales and for P&G, it will lead to an increased market share. There will be collaboration in a lot of things including supply chain, planning strategies and managing shelf space," said Kishore Biyani, founder of Future Group, which is the country's laryer gest retail firm. Globally, P&G sells about 14% of its annual sales or nearly $10 billion worth of consumer goods through Walmart. In India, Future Group has the widest network with around 13 million square feet of retail space in 221 cities through a 800-strong store network of supermarket brands such as Big Bazaar, EasyDay and Nilgiris. Future Group is also a large buyer from big clients operating in India including Hindustan Unilever and Nestle. However, Biyani asserts "Rest are transactional relationships but this is a strategic one." P&G's three entities in India, which sell products ranging from detergents and shampoo to razors and sanitary napkins, have a combined revenue of under $2 billion, less than 3% of its overall global sales. The business pales in comparison with Unilever's at nearly thrice as big in the country with products across price points. "It is standard practice for us to engage with our partners across the retail landscape including all our partners in modern retail, e-commerce and traditional retail to develop unique plans that create superior value for the shopper," said aP&G spokesperson. Unlike the Indian unit of Anglo-Dutch rival, P&G has been more focused on premium products that generate high sales at modern trade outlets in contrast to its rivals' route of stocking several mass brands on retail shelves. Experts said they can align their needs with that of a retailer. "This will allow P&G to bring newer brands and categories into India which can be incubated in modern stores through our stores," said Devendra Chawla, group president of FMCG and brands at Future Group. P&G has invested Rs 2,000 crore in India in the past four years, mainly to set up manufacturing units to reduce dependence on pricier imports. At present, it has seven manufacturing facilities in six states, accounting for more than 90% of its products sold in the subcontinent.

Frank Artiles, R-Miami. RELATED NEWS/ARCHIVE Joe Negron's Lake Okeechobee bill could decide Enterprise Florida's fate 4 Weeks Ago Small world: Enterprise Florida and Richard Corcoran's law firm 4 Weeks Ago How Walmart's decision to leave Midtown played into a Darryl Rouson vote 4 Weeks Ago At about 9:40 p.m., Senate President Joe Negron's office released this statement from Negron: “(Senate Minority Leader Oscar) Braynon reported this incident to me earlier today, and I was appalled to hear that one Senator would speak to another in such an offensive and reprehensible manner. My first priority was to ensure that this matter was promptly addressed between the two Senators involved, which occurred this evening.  Racial slurs and profane, sexist insults have no place in conversation between Senators and will not be tolerated while I am serving as Senate President. Senator Artiles has requested a point of personal privilege at the beginning of tomorrow’s sitting, during which he intends to formally apologize to Senator Gibson on the Senate Floor.” The statement came more than an hour after the Florida Democratic Party issued a statement demanding the resignation of Artiles. As a Result of Racist and Sexist Comments, Florida Democratic Party Calls on Senator Frank Artiles to Resign In response to the racist and sexist slurs used by Frank Artiles when referring to his African-American and female colleagues in the Senate, Florida Democratic Party spokesperson Johanna Cervone issued the following statement: "Frank Artiles must resign now. His use of horrific racist and sexist slurs towards his colleagues is disgusting, unacceptable and has no place in our democracy or our society. This is just the latest in a string of violent, hateful incidents in which Artiles blames his 'temper'. There is never an excuse for racism or misogyny and the people of Florida aren't buying it. Resign now." After 10 p.m., Sen. Bill Galvano, R-Bradenton, issued his own statement. "Senator Audrey Gibson is an admired colleague and a personal friend, and under no circumstances should ever have been spoken to in such a reprehensible manner. I understand that President Negron is allowing Senator Artiles to formally apologize on the Senate floor tomorrow. Such comments cannot be repaired by a formal apology, but I trust that it is an appropriate step to be taken by the President and the Florida Senate to handle this matter, and to ensure that this behavior is not tolerated and does not happen again."

Soul Obsession Yoga Mats has unique features you won’t find anywhere else. Inexpensive yoga mats tend to curl up, or get slippery as you sweat. Soul Obsession has unique features that address common issues with ordinary yoga mats and are superior in quality, design, eco-friendliness, and performance. Soul Obsession Yoga Mats are constructed in an eco-friendly manner made from 100% recyclable, and biodegradable materials.

They are multi-purpose and can be used for Yoga, Pilates, and aerobics. They are suitable for both men and women of all ages. They measure 68 (in) x 24 (in) x 4 (mm) in size, and come with a shoulder strap. They are machine washable/ air dry only. One Amazon reviewer who purchased the Soul Expression design writes, “I have been using my mat for about 3 months and I love it – the design is vibrant, and I always receive compliments. The microfiber cloth absorbs sweat and helps me keep my grip during poses without sliding. I also love the extended length of this yoga mat – it allows me to stretch out fully after a good savasana I would definitely recommend to yogis, especially those who sweat more and practice Bikram or other hot yoga with some regularity.” Soul Obsession Yoga Mats are characterized by using of a combination of eco-friendly materials, implement innovative new technology to give beautiful artistic designs, and are created to help save our beautiful planet. The company notes, “For decades, mats have allowed us to practice yoga, though a trip to your big-box retailer will quickly show you that most mats are simply commercialized for profit. Little care is given to the quality, performance, and design let alone the purpose to a higher, connecting, and spiritual cause. We felt that the time was right to embrace the art and our love for beautiful grounding exercises to create something unique. We do hope you’ll love using our mats just as much as we’ve loved making them. We’re certain that they’ll be a hit at your next session.”             Additionally, Soul Obsession also offers sporty and durable Yoga Mat Bags making the Yoga Mat portable and easy to carry when you’re on the go.

REUTERS/Daniel Becerril By Sharay Angulo, Reuters Apr 18, 2017 at 5:34 pm | Print View MEXICO CITY — The sweeping trade deal for the Pacific region known as the TPP might still be implemented by making adjustments to its text even though the United States has withdrawn, Mexico’s Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Tuesday. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, which had been promoted by former U.S. President Barack Obama and Japan as a way to counter China’s influence in a fast-growing region, was written in a way to prevent implementation without the United States. But if Japan leads the way, that clause could be stripped out without “any problem,” and Mexico and other members could evaluate the pros and cons of pushing forward with the TPP without the United States, Guajardo said at an event. “A TPP 11 instead of 12,” he said in reference to the remaining signatories to the deal since U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States after taking office in January. “But we’d have to see if nations such as Vietnam would put the same things on the table without the United States,” he added. Following the United States’ departure, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam are still signed up to TPP, though most must have put off ratifying it. TPP signatories are expected to delve deeper into trade at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit that Vietnam is hosting this year. Ministers start meetings in May and heads of state will gather in November. Several alternatives to TPP have been floated since Trump was elected in November, from inviting China to join the pact to doubling down on efforts to forge bilateral trade deals. Mexico is looking to diversify its trading options to counter the threat of Trump ditching the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which underpins the vast bulk of its commerce and binds it with the United States and Canada. Guajardo said that Trump’s recently signed “Buy American and Hire American” executive order that aims to boost purchases of American products in federal contracts might violate NAFTA by giving U.S. industries a new advantage, but he said it was still not clear how it would play out. Trump said Tuesday that he plans to make some “very big changes” to NAFTA or else get rid of it. Guajardo also said that the exchange rate was moving toward a more sustainable level after what he described as an overreaction by the market.

Company Summary NSE BSE Procter & Gamble Loading data...

ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES MUMBAI: Procter & Gamble (P&G), the world's biggest consumer goods company, has tied up with Future Group for joint sales forecasting and planning, exclusive product releases and the companies will embed officials from each at the headquarters and be part of supplychain initiatives. The two companies have met nearly four times over the year in India and the global headquarters of P&G at Cincinnati to take their association beyond the retailer-client relationship. P&G's global CEO David Taylor is currently in India for the MoU, which will be akin to the one it has with Walmart in the US. ET first reported on their likely alliance last year in October. "It will help us to grow sales and for P&G, it will lead to an increased market share. There will be collaboration in a lot of things including supply chain, planning strategies and managing shelf space," said Kishore Biyani, founder of Future Group, which is the country's laryer gest retail firm. Globally, P&G sells about 14% of its annual sales or nearly $10 billion worth of consumer goods through Walmart. In India, Future Group has the widest network with around 13 million square feet of retail space in 221 cities through a 800-strong store network of supermarket brands such as Big Bazaar, EasyDay and Nilgiris. Future Group is also a large buyer from big clients operating in India including Hindustan Unilever and Nestle. However, Biyani asserts "Rest are transactional relationships but this is a strategic one." P&G's three entities in India, which sell products ranging from detergents and shampoo to razors and sanitary napkins, have a combined revenue of under $2 billion, less than 3% of its overall global sales. The business pales in comparison with Unilever's at nearly thrice as big in the country with products across price points. "It is standard practice for us to engage with our partners across the retail landscape including all our partners in modern retail, e-commerce and traditional retail to develop unique plans that create superior value for the shopper," said aP&G spokesperson. Unlike the Indian unit of Anglo-Dutch rival, P&G has been more focused on premium products that generate high sales at modern trade outlets in contrast to its rivals' route of stocking several mass brands on retail shelves. Experts said they can align their needs with that of a retailer. "This will allow P&G to bring newer brands and categories into India which can be incubated in modern stores through our stores," said Devendra Chawla, group president of FMCG and brands at Future Group. P&G has invested Rs 2,000 crore in India in the past four years, mainly to set up manufacturing units to reduce dependence on pricier imports. At present, it has seven manufacturing facilities in six states, accounting for more than 90% of its products sold in the subcontinent.

By David Pinsky The U.S. is the largest market for canned tuna in the world. U.S. consumers purchase countless cans and serve up thousands of tuna melts day after day. Today's flashy labels and PR claims from supermarket and national tuna brands can be confusing and sometimes deceiving. Even worse, much of the canned tuna available in the U.S. comes from destructive fishing practices and could be linked to human rights abuses. Greenpeace is campaigning to clean up this dirty global industry to ensure workers' rights and healthy oceans for generations to come. We collectively have the power to transform the tuna industry, and that starts by being informed. That's why today we're excited to share our brand new canned Tuna Shopping Guide—en Español, too! We evaluated 20 well-known brands on their sourcing policies, whether they avoid shark finning and destructive fishing practices, whether they can trace their products back to sea, and how they protect human rights for seafood industry workers. Click through to see how your favorite canned tuna brand ranks. © Greenpeace Wild Planet and American Tuna tied for first place, followed by Whole Foods and Ocean Naturals as the best choices for conscious shoppers. Walmart (18th), H-E-B (19th), and StarKist (20th) are the worst-ranked due to their reliance on destructive fishing methods and outstanding questions about the social responsibility of their products. The differences between those at the top and the very bottom of our ranking couldn't be more pronounced. Among the five largest supermarket chains in the country, Albertsons (eighth; notable store banners include Safeway, Vons, Jewel-Osco), Ahold Delhaize (10th; banners include Food Lion, Hannaford, Giant), and Kroger (11th; banners include Fred Meyer, QFC, Ralphs) all passed. Kroger, second only in size nationwide to Walmart, is even rolling out new responsibly-caught pole and line canned tuna this year. While only 55 percent of the brands we assessed passed, that's up from around 40 percent when we ranked popular brands in 2015. Only a few years ago, Whole Foods led the nation as the first retailer to offer responsibly-caught store brand canned tuna. Today, 11 of the 14 retailers we assessed carry at least one responsibly-caught store brand product. That's a big deal—you might even call it the beginning of a tuna revolution. These changes are happening because consumers like you demanded them. As the call grows louder for seafood that doesn't wreck the oceans or perpetuate human rights abuses, it's time for some of the biggest in the industry that are failing to show some leadership. You guessed it: Costco (13th), Walmart (18th), and the big three tuna brands—Chicken of the Sea (15th), Bumble Bee (17th), and StarKist (20th)—all failed in this year's Tuna Guide. The largest three tuna brands, in particular, are dragging down the U.S. market in a sea of ocean destruction. Chicken of the Sea, owned by the world's largest tuna company Thai Union, has a chance to right its ship. Its parent company has made bold claims on sustainability and human rights, though it remains to be seen how that translates into real action and better tuna for customers. The company still has a chance to lead and continue moving the industry in the right direction, but we need your help to demand immediate action. Join us! Ask Chicken of the Sea to commit to protect the oceans and seafood workers. If you're going to buy canned tuna, the next time you look on store shelves consider how your choices will impact the oceans and seafood workers. Keep the Tuna Shopping Guide close by, share it with your friends and family, and let your grocery store manager know why they should carry responsibly-caught canned tuna. Together, we can protect the oceans for future generations. Politics Lorraine Chow 12h Trump Team Sharply Divided Over Paris Climate Agreement President Donald Trump's top advisors and cabinet officials will debate whether the U.S. should pull out of the Paris climate change agreement. The landmark accord, which aims to keep global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius, was agreed upon by nearly 200 countries in 2015. The Hill reported that the meeting is aimed at hammering out a growing divide in the administration between those in favor of the deal and those opposed to it. The meeting was originally scheduled for Tuesday but had to be postponed as some participants are traveling with the president to Milwaukee. During the presidential campaign, Trump vowed to " cancel" the Paris climate agreement. The president, who once said climate change is a "hoax" and is working to dismantle environmental regulations, has surrounded himself with like-minded advisors and cabinet appointees such as senior adviser Steve Bannon and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt, who said last week "we need to exit" the deal. POLITICO's sources said that the EPA chief is concerned that the Paris agreement could harm his legal position as he works to repeal President Obama's Clean Power Plan that regulates emissions from power plants. On the other hand, Sec. of State Rex Tillerson, the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, a White House special adviser, have are urged the president to stay in the deal, as Bloomberg reported. Trump's current position on the Paris deal is unclear, but the New York Times reported that the pro-Paris view is gaining favor. "We do not currently believe the Trump administration plans to withdraw from either Paris agreement," wrote Kevin Book, an analyst at DC-based ClearView Energy Partners in a memo to clients on Monday. Incidentally, some major oil and coal producers have voiced support of the climate agreement, including Cheniere Energy Inc., ExxonMobil Corp., which was previously led by Tillerson, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc. Coal baron Robert E. Murray, however, has opposed the deal as "just a way for other countries to get American money." And Joseph Bast, the president of the climate change-denying Heartland Institute, commented that "President Trump should run, not walk, away from the Paris climate treaty." "Most scientists do not believe global warming is a crisis that merits current efforts aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, much less the draconian cuts envisioned by the Paris climate treaty," Bast said. As Trump mulls the decision, other world leaders are prepared to ramp action in case the U.S. pulls out. "No matter how other countries' policies on climate change, as a responsible large developing country China's resolve, aims and policy moves in dealing with climate change will not change," said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang. Similarly, Piyush Goyal, the Indian Minister for power and coal said that India is "pursuing religiously" its goal of developing 225 gigawatts of clean energy by 2022, adding "it's not subject to some other country's decision." Environmental groups have also weighed in on the deliberations. As the world's largest economy, the United States' withdrawal from the accord could significantly weaken the global pact. "The United States is the world's largest historic climate polluter," said Friends of the Earth senior political director Ben Schreiber. "Our country has a moral imperative to take action proportionate to our responsibility for this crisis." "Our commitments under the Paris Agreement were already woefully inadequate given our responsibility and the severity of the problem," Schreiber added. "By holding this meeting, Trump has communicated to the rest of the world that the U.S. is a climate pariah. We call on world leaders to use every political and economic means available to compel Trump to act in accordance with what climate science and justice demand." The White House meeting comes as activists gear up for the April 29 Peoples Climate March in the nation's capitol and in sister marches around the country. "An overwhelming majority of people in the United States support staying in the Paris agreement," 350.org executive director May Boeve. "It's one of the animating reasons why so many people are joining the Peoples Climate March this April 29th in Washington, DC and across the country." "As the Trump administration deliberates isolating the U.S. from the rest of the world, movements for climate, jobs and justice are mobilizing to continue to build bold solutions that protect our communities and tackle climate change," Boeve said. "We know this deal is critical to defending our climate and communities—this is about our very survival." White House Press Sec. Sean Spicer said last month that Trump will make a decision about the Paris agreement ahead of the Group of 7 leaders' meeting in late May. Keep reading...

Included in those cuts is the complete elimination of the Sea Grant program. As a former California Sea Grant fellow with the California Natural Resources Agency, I take personal offense to this assault. The fellowship program has been invaluable to me, giving me a vital role in the state's efforts to address marine litter and waste management issues, teaching me to critically evaluate and craft policy solutions, as well as how to interpret and translate science for policy and communications. Sea Grant's state and federal fellowships provide recent graduates with an opportunity to participate in research and policy using a science-based approach. The program trains the next generation of decision makers and policy professionals to ensure balanced management of our marine resources. California Sea Grant and University of Southern California Sea Grant programs are both highly successful beyond the state fellowship program. Check out some of their accomplishments here: California Sea Grant University of Southern California Sea Grant Indeed, the fellowship program is only a small fraction of the vital work that the Sea Grant program contributes nationwide each year. For 50 years, Sea Grant has been at the forefront of creating economic opportunities, enhancing food and water security, and reducing risks from natural hazards and extreme events facing coastal communities through research and outreach efforts. Sea Grant's research has been critical to making smart decisions about how we manage, protect, and use the resources from our nation's coastal, marine, and Great Lakes environments. In fiscal year 2015-16 alone, Sea Grant used its $67.3 million federal appropriation to generate an estimated $575 million in economic impacts around the country; created or sustained nearly 21,000 jobs and almost 3,000 businesses; helped 534 coastal communities implement sustainable development practices or policies so they are more resilient to hazards like flooding and hurricanes; and helped more than 40,000 fishermen adopt sustainable harvesting techniques. Sea Grant is a key partner in: developing sufficient capabilities to sustain ocean-based economies; growing our marine food sector; diversifying our energy sources; protecting critical ocean and coastal infrastructure and related natural resources; and training the next generation of scientists, managers, and stakeholders. These are all necessary components of a more resilient ocean, coastal and Great Lakes. For more information, check out some of Sea Grant's national-level accomplishments. Let's make our voices heard and make sure Sea Grant is here to stay! Here are four simple steps you can take to help save this important program: 1. Spread the word—share this blog with your friends and family on social media. 2. Join the Surfrider Foundation and support our efforts to #SaveNOAA. 3. Volunteer at a local chapter and get involved! 4. Contact your representatives—a quick phone call is best! Find your representative's contact information here. Here are a few talking points you can use: I'm calling today to let (elected official) know that I oppose the president's proposed cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), specifically the elimination of the Sea Grant program. Sea Grant directly contributes to job creation and economic development, the core functions of the Department of Commerce. Federal funding of Sea Grant goes a long way. Each dollar Sea Grant receives in federal funds is multiplied threefold through strategic partnerships with academic and grant funders. I personally value (name Sea Grant program or service that is important to you). (Click here for more information about Sea Grant's workshops, trainings and programs in your area.) Again, I urge (elected official) to maintain funding for Sea Grant in NOAA's 2017 and 2018 budgets. Thank you for your time. Keep reading...

That's the adorable Twitter tagline of six-year-old podcaster Nate Butkus, who hosts "The Show About Science." The Chicago-based youngster started his show when he was only five years old with the help of his producer dad, Eric Butkus. Episodes cover complex scientific topics, from radiation to genome-editing, and feature renowned scientists from around the world. In a recent episode, Dr. John Wiens, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona, discussed climate change and its impact on evolution. The inquisitive first-grader asked, "Why are people causing climate change?" and, "So, um, how fast is the rate of extinction going?" and, "Why don't our politicians believe in climate change?" During one part of the interview, Wiens suggested cutting out or reducing meat consumption to reduce carbon and methane emissions. "I want to do it, but I love bacon," Nate charmingly commented, but later agreed to eat less to help the environment. According to STAT, each episode has been downloaded about 4,000 times.

The judges concluded that Monsanto has engaged in practices that have impinged on the basic human right to a healthy environment, the right to food and the right to health. Additionally, Monsanto's conduct has a negative impact on the right of scientists to freely conduct indispensable research. The judges also concluded that despite the development of regulations intended to protect the environment, a gap remains between commitments and the reality of environmental protection. International law should now precisely and clearly assert the protection of the environment and establish the crime of ecocide. The Tribunal concluded that if ecocide were formally recognized as a crime in international criminal law, the activities of Monsanto could possibly constitute a crime of ecocide. In the third part of the advisory opinion, the Tribunal focused on the widening gap between international human rights law and corporate accountability. It called for the need to assert the primacy of international human and environmental rights law. A set of legal rules is in place to protect investors' rights in the frame of the World Trade Organization and in bilateral investment treaties and in clauses in free-trade agreements. These provisions tend to undermine the capacity of nations to maintain policies, laws and practices protecting human and environmental rights. United Nations bodies urgently need to take action. Otherwise, key questions of human and environmental rights violations will be resolved by private tribunals operating entirely outside the United Nations framework. The Tribunal also urged to hold non-state actors responsible within international human rights law. The Tribunal reiterated that multinational enterprises should be recognized as responsible actors and should be subjected to the International Criminal Court jurisdiction in case of infringement of fundamental rights. The Tribunal clearly identified and denounced a severe disparity between the rights of multinational corporations and their obligations. Therefore, the advisory opinion encouraged authoritative bodies to protect the effectiveness of international human rights and environmental law against the conduct of multinational corporations. The very clear conclusions will be of interest to both the critics of Monsanto and industrial agriculture and to the shareholders of chemical companies and especially Bayer. The reputation of Monsanto—and Bayer in case of a merger—will not exactly improve with these conclusions by the judges of the Tribunal. The advisory opinion is a strong signal to those involved in international law, but also to the victims of toxic chemicals. The Tribunal has created links and shared important information between lawyers and organizations that represent the victims. Therefore, it is likely that the conclusions will lead to more liability cases against Monsanto and similar companies. This will shine a light on the true cost of production and will affect Monsanto (Bayer) shareholder value in the long run. Companies that cause damage to health, food and healthy environment should and will be held accountable for their actions. Organizing groups behind the Monsanto Tribunal include the Organic Consumers Association, Navdanya, IFOAM Organics International, Biovision Foundation and Regeneration International. Keep reading...

In December, President Obama permanently protected large areas of U.S. waters in the Arctic from oil and gas drilling. The new bill—Senate Bill 883—would effectively cancel these protections and force the Department of the Interior to quickly approve new oil and gas leasing. "It's not possible to drill safely in the Arctic, as we just saw from the leaking oil and gas well on the North Slope," said Miyoko Sakashita, ocean programs director at the Center for Biological Diversity. "This legislation's nothing more than a giveaway to oil companies. It'll hurt Alaska's healthy habitat and endangered wildlife." S. 883 would require Interior to add at least three leases each in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas and one in Cook Inlet to each five-year leasing plan. The agency would be required to establish a new near-shore Beaufort planning area with annual lease sales for the next three years. The bill would also overturn President Obama's decision to stop exploration and drilling permanently in most of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas under Section 12(a) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act. These areas are home to several endangered species, including polar bears and bowhead whales. "If we let oil companies drill the Arctic, a catastrophic oil spill is just a matter of time," Sakashita said. "It's shameful that the Alaska congressional delegation has so little regard for the horrendous damage the oil industry could do to this fragile ecosystem and the people who live and work along this coast." Leading climate scientists say the vast majority of untapped fossil fuels must stay in the ground to avoid catastrophic, irreversible changes to the climate. Unleased federal waters contain an estimated 75 billion barrels of crude oil, more than twice that of unleased federal lands. Stopping the expansion of new leases in federal waters would keep 61.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide out of our atmosphere and oceans. Keep reading... Show less Sponsored Politics Lorraine Chow 16h Wind farm in Weatherford, Oklahoma. Oklahoma Ends Wind Subsidy Despite Generous Tax Breaks for Fossil Fuel Industry Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin signed a bill into law Monday that will end a state tax credit several years early for electricity generated by wind power. Under the new legislation, wind farms that start producing energy after July 1 will not be able to claim the state's "zero emission tax credit" program. The credit was originally set to expire in January 2021. Fallin acknowledged that the program, which pushed claims from $3.7 million in 2010 to $113 million in 2014, helped Oklahoma become the third-largest producer of wind power in the country. However, the Republican governor noted that the state's estimated $868 million budget shortfall necessitated the phaseout of wind incentives. "The zero emissions tax credit was key to the growth of wind energy in Oklahoma, and I'm grateful to the industry for their ambitious successes, as well as their willingness to work with the state to address our challenging budgetary circumstances," Fallin said. "It is time to ensure that Oklahoma has a bright future, and continues its position as a prominent energy state." The measure appeared to have support from the wind industry itself. Jeffrey Clark, president of The Wind Coalition, told The Oklahoman that the incentives have been "incredibly beneficial, but we remain the first and only industry to offer to phase out its incentives." But Fallin and state lawmakers have been criticized for keeping generous tax breaks in place for the oil and gas industry while squeezing other public services such as school funding during the budget crisis. As the Associated Press reported: Even then, the revenue generated by wind facilities won't "move the needle very much on the state budget," said Dr. Stephen Stadler, a board member of the Oklahoma Renewable Energy Council. He said lawmakers should roll back other tax credits and incentives, including generous subsidies provided to the oil and natural gas industry. "Can we afford those subsidies?" he asked. "Things are not even. It's not a level playing field." Oklahoma's wind subsidies are dwarfed by subsidies to the oil and gas industry, David Blatt from the Oklahoma Policy Institute pointed out. "The estimates of the cost of subsidies for wind producers vary, but we do know they are substantially less than the $400 million to $600 million cost of subsidies for oil and gas," Blatt wrote. Fallin's executive budget proposed in February sought to phase out wind incentives that she said are no longer necessary. "This industry was incentivized sufficiently to now be a major player in the Oklahoma energy industry, and a major winner of now-unnecessary incentives," the budget read. The Oklahoman reported last year that state fossil fuel executives, including oilman and Trump advisor Harold Hamm, had formed a coalition to lobby for the end of wind tax credits in the state.

Show less Politics Union of Concerned Scientists 17h The Leopold Center Iowa Legislature Plays Politics With Critical Scientific Research Center By Andrea Basche There has been unsettling news out of my former home over the last week, as the Iowa legislature plays politics with critical scientific research in the state. In the closing days of the legislative session, two budget bills moved swiftly that could force the closing of the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture, a nationally recognized center for sustainable agriculture research. There were also threats to a research center dedicated to mitigating flood impacts (which I wrote about last year for its excellent forecasting that literally helped saved lives), but that appears now to be safe. A little bit of background: the Leopold Center was established in 1987 by Iowa's Groundwater Protection Act. This law passed as the farm crisis of the 1980's was raging (it is estimated that nearly one-third of the state's farms went out of business) and there was growing recognition of the problems associated with soil degradation and water pollution. Forward-thinking Iowa legislators came up with a funding stream—a small fertilizer and pesticide tax that generates several million dollars a year—to be dedicated to research on alternatives that offset the economic and environmental impacts of agriculture. The resulting funding stream launched several important research enterprises—for example, a center studying health effects of environmental contaminants at the University of Iowa, long-term agricultural research sites across the state, as well as the Leopold Center, which is based at Iowa State University. Since that time, the Leopold Center's competitive grants program has funded research that benefits both rural and urban constituents, with projects that range from local food infrastructure to crop diversification to beginner farmer programs. Many of the innovative topics the center has investigated are now widely accepted largely thanks to its efforts, so it's important to recognize how critical this type of rare funding support is for encouraging and spreading transformative ideas. Research Far and Wide Has Benefited from the Leopold Center The Leopold Center's research not only supports progress at the state level, but also has direct application to progress on a national level. Our own research here at the Union of Concerned Scientists has benefited from the Leopold Center's novel work. In our 2016 report, Growing Economies, we evaluated the economic impact of more local food purchasing in the state of Iowa. We were able to do that using survey data generated by the Leopold Center, in which institutional and intermediate food purchasers were asked about their ability to support local food. And in Subsidizing Waste, we calculated the economic impact of scaling up the integration of perennial vegetation into corn and soybean fields, to save money on water clean-up costs. The STRIPs project has long been supported by funding from the Leopold Center. Finally, a report we're preparing to release next month will detail how a crop rotation system developed at Iowa State and supported by the center could be expanded, spreading economic and environmental benefits across the state and the Corn Belt. Also, earlier in my career while I was a Ph.D. student at Iowa State University, I received two Leopold Center research grants to study the long-term impacts and farmer adoption of cover crops. That was an invaluable professional development opportunity for me as an early career scientist: from developing the proposal to helping administer the project and to making decisions on dollars spent. If a research center like this disappears, it would be yet another significant blow in the broader conversation over how much funding goes toward sustainable agriculture. In a recent analysis, we looked at competitive grants programs within the USDA, concluding that agroecological research (similar to projects supported by the Leopold Center) is woefully underfunded, with less than 15 percent of funding going to projects that included any element of this type of work. We need more of this type of research, not less, and nearly 500 Ph.D. level scientists agree. Lawmaker Claims "Mission Accomplished" in Sustainable Agriculture (LOL!) An Iowa state representative this week in an interview claimed: "A lot of people felt that the mission for sustainable agriculture that [the Leopold Center] undertook, that they have completed that mission." The same lawmaker also claimed that sustainable agriculture research at Iowa State can continue, but through other channels. These comments either suggest an utter lack of understanding around the reality of sustainable agriculture, or otherwise reveal the politics fueling these budget bills. The agriculture and natural resources committee budget bill directs the Leopold Center to shut its doors this summer, and directs their funds to another center at Iowa State University. The other center does not currently have a track record of transparently administering research dollars, and has a far narrower scope than the current vision of the Leopold Center. Comments to the tune of "someone else will do the research" always give me pause. The common thread I've noticed is that research deemed duplicative or unnecessary often simply doesn't jibe with financial interests. It is easy to see that research describing less use of pesticides, for example, might be viewed as controversial to powerful business interests. (Many examples of this already exist!) Further, to claim "mission accomplished" on sustainable agriculture is laughable, and hints at willful ignorance about the current economic and environment realities in Iowa. They bear similarities to the 1980s: soil erosion and water pollution remain persistent and costly challenges, and farm incomes have been steeply declining for several years. Research Should Be Free of Interference Even When the Politics Are Thorny Even though it might not be popular for those with a financial stake in the status quo, the research made possible by the Leopold Center plays a critical role in the future of the state, if not the nation, and has broad public support. So it's hard not to see this incident as part of the larger political attacks on science, with parallels to the Trump Administration's numerous attacks on climate action. In addition to research funds, the Leopold Center supports a diverse dialogue by bringing in valuable speakers and lectures to Iowa State's campus; I shudder to think how that important dialogue will change if the state legislature votes to close its doors. The center has a successful and important track record benefitting local and national public interests, and I hope it stays that way.

Mark Carter, CEO of Passport Health Plan Passport Health Plan's headquarters in Commerce Crossings LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) --  Passport Health Plan, the nonprofit that administers Medicaid benefits in the Louisville area, may be moving its corporate office to the vacant West Louisville site where Walmart had once planned to build a super center. Passport CEO Mark Carter and Mayor Greg Fischer are set to make "a major economic development announcement that will lead to the largest number of jobs to west Louisville in decades" Wednesday morning at the site at Broadway and 18th Street. Both Passport and the mayor's office declined to comment on the announcement Tuesday.  The Courier-Journal first reported the potential move Monday evening, citing unnamed sources. Passport and its partner Evolent Health, a for-profit company based in Virginia, have about 500 employees at Passport’s office in the Commerce Crossings business park in southern Jefferson County. Last year, the organizations announced a partnership that could more than double the Louisville employee base, officials said at the time. Evolent is using Passport’s office in Louisville as the backbone of a national Medicaid consulting business helping other provider organizations around the country shift to a value-based payment model. As part of the deal, about 350 of Passport’s roughly 500 employees shifted to Evolent Health, and Passport received $15 million worth of Evolent stock. When the deal was announced in February 2016, officials said it had the potential to create 647 additional, well-paying jobs in Louisville within five years. At the time, Passport CEO Mark Carter said the job growth could necessitate a new location for Passport and Evolent’s Medicaid center. Passport’s move to the West Louisville site, at 18th and Broadway, would mark a turnaround for the property after Walmart backed out of a plan to build a store there late last year. But it would first require the resolution of a lawsuit in which a bank is trying to wrest control of the property from its owners, developers Frank and Teresa Bridgewaters. MainSource Bank of Greensburg, Ind. filed the foreclosure action in February, alleging that the Bridgewaterses defaulted on a $1.7 million credit line. The bank has asked the court to auction the property to repay the credit line. Neither MainSource Bank nor the Bridgewaterses returned calls on Tuesday. The Bridgewaterses got the site – a former Phillip Morris cigarette plant – from the city in 2006. Their company, Newbridge Development, paid nothing for the property, but they promised to demolish the old cigarette plant buildings and market the land for redevelopment. Property records show they pledged the site as collateral in 2007 to obtain the $1.7 million credit line, which ultimately ended up with MainSource Bank after two refinancings. RELATED: SUNDAY EDITION | After collapse of Walmart deal, developers face debts to bank and taxpayers Apart from the $1.7 million credit line, Newbridge also owes $1.3 million to the city under a 2013 no-interest loan given by Fischer’s office. The city, through its attorneys, has said it plans to exhaust every option to collect on the debt. On Tuesday, Fischer's office a meeting of the obscure city agency that holds the development agreement with Newbridge, to consider a "settlement of all claims" with the developer.  Copyright 2017 WDRB Media.

Home News Opinion Letters Sports Prospecting Roadbeat Essentials Obituaries Real Estate Gallery Classifieds Advertisers Ad Rates 1,550 30 PLACERVILLE, CALIFORNIA Obituaries Erline LaVerne Yablonovsky By Contributor From page A2 | April 19, 2017 FacebookTwitter FacebookTwitter July 3, 1947 — April 16, 2017 Erline, 69, of Diamond Springs, Calif., passed away on Easter morning, April 16, 2017, peacefully at home. A celebration of life will be held at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Chapel, located at 3275 Cedar Ravine Drive in Placerville, Calif. A viewing will be held from 9 to 9:30 a.m. with a funeral service to follow at 10 a.m. Interment will be at the Veteran’s Cemetery in Fernley, Nev. Erline was born in Lynwood, Calif., on July 3, 1947, to Andrew Lincoln Skinner and LaVerna Marble. She graduated from Lynwood High School. Later she attended BYU Provo, Utah and Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa. She was one of six children — DeVar, Eunice, Monty, Erline, Steven and Jonna. She married Martin Joseph Yablonovsky on Dec. 19, 1970, in Lynwood. They were sealed for time and all eternity in the Oakland Temple on Dec. 9, 1978. Erline interned in the banking industry during her senior year of high school. While at BYU she worked at the Genealogical Society in Salt Lake City. Her various jobs included a doctor’s receptionist, a Montessori certified teacher teaching in Placerville and Shingle Springs, Calif., and most importantly, a loving mother to her children. More recently, she was a night stocker at the Folsom Wal-Mart and cashier at the new and much closer Placerville Wal-Mart, serving them for more than 20 years. She dearly loved her Wal-Mart customers and they in turn dearly loved her. Her customers were excited to see the different earrings she wore each and every day. Erline loved service in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The many areas of service included teaching in primary, Sunday school and Young Women’s; being a faithful visiting teacher; and especially serving as the Relief Society President of the Pleasant Valley Ward. Erline is survived by her husband, Martin Yablonovsky D.C. They together have eight children, and with the last count, 29 grandchildren all under the age of 18 — all of whom she dearly loved. They are Martin Yablonovsky (Carmen Cox), Isaak, Ingrid, Briar, Micah Yablonovsky (Kristin Vance), Miles, Blake, Abigail, Aubrey, Madison, Dylan, Mindy Kenison, Porter, Aspen, Easton, Teague, Oakley, Cooper, Memory Russo (Chris), Marissa, Ashley, Tanner, Jarom, Brigham, Hyrum, Kourtney, Joe Yablonovsky, Kiplan, Colette, Svenrik, Ezrett, Corey Martin Yablonovsky (deceased Easter 1983), Jesse Yablonovsky (Jena Bailey), Carmel, Sawyer, Sage and John Yablonovsky (Kara Nuss). The family of Erline Yablonovsky wishes to thank all those at Marshall Hospital and Hospice for their kind and loving care.

(Photo: Drew Angerer, Getty Images) 10 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDIN 1 COMMENTEMAILMORE It's Tax Day! Time to make like "Saturday Night Fever" and do the hustle — or figure out what to do if you really, really need more time. The Internal Revenue Service expected that it would receive about 18 million individual income tax returns for the week ending April 15, with about 16 million filed electronically. This week, the IRS expects to receive another 12 million tax returns. Related:  Here's why post offices aren't open late on Tax Day anymore Hungry Howie's has 15 cent pizza deal for Tax Day So far in Michigan, the IRS said it has received 3.7 million individual electronically filed tax returns as of Monday. That's compared with a total of 4.2 million e-filed tax returns in Michigan for all of last year. So clearly, a few hundred thousand of our friends and family here could be filing today. Here are some five last-really-last-minute tax tips: 1) Need an extension of time to file that return?  Here's a link to Form 4868 at www.irs.gov. You can file an application for an automatic extension of time to file an individual tax return. But remember, the key words here are "extension of time." If you owe money, you're required to pay it by today. If you don't pay all you owe today, you can be hit by interest and penalties. Penalties for those who owe tax and fail to file either a tax return or an extension request by April 18 can be higher than if they had filed and not paid the taxes they owed. It is better to file for an extension than just ignore filing anything, especially if you owe money. You can easily request an extension and file Form 4868 electronically by yourself or through a tax professional. The IRS expected to see nearly 8.4 million extension requests for extensions in the final days of the filing season. Most tax filers who request an extension would have until Oct. 16 to file that 2016 return but there may be some exceptions if you're living out of the country. Taxpayers can select one of many payment options. They can pay online, by phone or with their mobile device using the IRS2Go app. It's possible to use Direct Pay; Electronic Federal Tax Payment System; electronic funds withdrawal; same-day wire; a debit or credit card; check or money order; or cash. Some of these options are free; others require a fee. Pay by cash? Yes, if you are near a participating retailer, like a 7-Eleven store. If you pay today by check, make the checks payable to U.S. Treasury. 2) Worried that you can't do your taxes by yourself?  Not surprisingly, plenty of tax preparation outlets will be open for business today. H&R Block offices, for example, had planned to open at 8 a.m. local time across the country today. Gene King, an H&R Block spokesperson, said the H&R Block offices will be open until the last client is served tonight. But when is that exactly? Can you pull up at 11 p.m. and expect tax help? Maybe not. "Tax pros will be working to get every tax return they have filed by midnight but it’s not like they are seeing clients at that time," King said. Obviously, King noted, that H&R Block will be open rest of the week, too. So if things go haywire today, it's possible to handle some issues later this week. The sooner, the better, of course, in order to avoid tax penalties and interest on any taxes owed. If you're owed a refund, don't worry too much because you're not hit with a penalty for filing late if you're getting a refund. Near a Walmart? Jackson Hewitt tax offices are in several Walmart store locations, as well, including Walmart stores in Warren and Sterling Heights. Check the hours. The Jackson Hewitt location in Walmart in Warren, for example, is listed online as being open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. today. Obviously, you can easily go online today to prepare your own taxes. You've got plenty of online options -- including TurboTax, H&R Block, Jackson Hewitt Online and the Free File program at IRS.gov. The Free File program offers access to professional tax software for those with incomes that are lower than $64,000. Some free state return options are available too. “If you’re stuck at work and have waited until now, why not give Free File a try? It’s available right now," said Luis D. Garcia, a spokesperson for the IRS in Detroit. See www.irs.gov and click on the "Free File" icon on the right of the screen. Tax filers with low-to-moderate incomes also might qualify for free tax help through the Accounting Aid Society and others. "We are busy today with several sites open until 4 pm.," said Marshall Hunt, certified public accountant and director of tax policy for the Accounting Aid Society's tax assistance program in metro Detroit. He noted that appointments are filled but the Accounting Aid Society sites will take walk-ins when possible. For information on locations, tax filers can call 313-556-1920. Accounting Aid Society sites will be open several days a week by appointment beginning next Monday at its five Neighborhood Financial Hubs. Call for an appointment. 3) Don't rush so much that you make mistakes.  One tax tip that's worth repeating over and over again: Double check your numbers. Double check your Social Security number. Re-check your bank account information, if you're having your tax refund directly deposited into your checking or savings account. “Direct deposit is safe and easy but remember that we’ll send your refund to whichever account you tell us to, so make certain it’s your account," Garcia said. "Double and even triple check those routing and account numbers.” Remember to sign and date your return. If you're filing a joint return, both spouses need to sign.

Can student loans cut hundreds off your taxes? 4) So where is your refund?  Seriously, don't try calling just any IRS number to find out. The main IRS number is 800-829-1040. But no surprise, there's high call volume today and you're going to wait a very long time. "Don't call the main IRS number to check your refund, you're just going to be stuck waiting way longer than if you use our "Where's My Refund?" hotline 800-829-1954," Garcia said. Garcia said it's better to check the "Where's My Refund?" link at www.irs.gov. Or you can use your smartphone and use the IRS app "IRS2Go." The IRS said it issues more than 9 out of 10 refunds in less than 21 days. But remember, it's possible your tax return could require additional review and take longer. IRS phone and walk-in representatives can research the status of your refund if it's been 21 days or more since you e-filed and you still haven't received that refund. The IRS will check the status of a paper return that's been put in the mail if you've not received your refund after more than 6 weeks since you mailed the return. The "Where’s My Refund?" site also might direct you to contact the IRS directly. 5) What do you do if you suddenly realized something was wrong?  What if you filed a 2016 tax return already and then spot a 1099-DIV form tucked into a magazine while cleaning the house? It happens. If you overlooked some income or an important deduction, it's possible to amend a tax return. You're going to need to file a 1040X or amended tax return.  Contact Susan Tompor: stompor@freepress.com or 313-222-8876.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 April 2017 by Military News DynAdmic Gives Global Brands The Opportunity to Buy “Safe” YouTube Ads NEW YORK–(BUSINESS WIRE)–In recent weeks, some of the world’s top brands, including L’Oreal, HSBC, Starbucks, and Walmart, have pulled their ad spending from Google, as a result of their ads appearing next to objectionable content on YouTube or websites the online ad giant monetizes. These brands are searching for a new digital video advertising safe haven that some believe, will be hard to find. In the midst of all of this upheaval and advertising anarchy, DynAdmic, a digital video advertising firm, has come to save the day with a unique set of tools that stirs up the competition and catches the eye of the world’s top brands and media agencies. “The only way to prevent brands from being shown in an unsafe environment, is to analyze both written (page level) and spoken content (video level), not just rely on a quality score or the reputation of a video or website,” said DynAdmic CEO Stéphane Bonjean. “We are scrubbing through online video content as if it was done by a human being. With our technology, we can listen to the videos, hunt for shocking sounds and inappropriate spoken content, to make sure our clients are buying ad space within a secure environment.” For the past four years, DynAdmic’s prerogative has been to protect the brands they work with, such as BMW, Red Bull, Kellogg’s, McDonald’s and American Express, from appearing next to undesirable videos or articles that do not fit within the brands’ vision. Now you might find yourself asking “How exactly does DynAdmic prevent ads from appearing next to objectionable content?”. And how it works is, DynAdmic’s proprietary audio recognition technology analyzes the audio track of a video people are watching online to identify the viewer’s interest and serve relevant ads. By using the same technology, DynAdmic is able to filter out YouTube’s or any website’s undesirable video inventory by identifying sounds, written and spoken keywords that are associated with undesirable content, such as violence, offensive language, hate speech, etc… The video content recognition and analysis is based on signal processing, machine learning (artificial intelligence), latent semantic analysis, and parallel computing. With 6 billion ad placements analyzed every day, DynAdmic is leveraging its hyper-targeting technology to provide a level of brand safety known for its efficiency and scalability. Finally, in regards to a full approach to ad verification, DynAdmic’s fraud rate, monitored by MOAT, is less than 1% on all its campaigns (Q1 2017).

We like this definition. NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / April 18, 2017 / The $230 billion fast food industry is the next big, very big, frontier for self-serve, cashless kiosks. Over the past decade, consumers who don’t like waiting in lines have enjoyed self-checkout at retail outlets, including grocery stores, Target, and Walmart. Self-serve fast food kiosks take this trend one giant leap forward and have met with huge consumer approval at a growing number of fast casual and fast food chains. Each one of these self-serve kiosks has a cashless payment processing device. On Track Innovations (OTI) (NASDAQ: OTIV), a leading global innovator in near field communication (NFC) and cashless payment solutions, is aggressively going after this market. $18 billion is the estimated size of the self-checkout kiosk market by 2020, according to Technavio. Growth is driven, in part, by the fast food industry’s adoption of the technology. Moreover, the fast food industry, by virtue of its magnitude, is hugely influential in trend setting and consumer purchasing habits. Consumers who get used to using self-serve touchscreen kiosks at McDonald’s are more likely to use them in many other retail settings, further propelling demand for the kind of cashless payment solutions offered by OTI. “Thousands” of cashless payment systems were sold by OTI for use at kiosks and self-checkout stations at fast food chains across the U.S., according to a press release issued by OTI in February. The buyers are fast food chains that are “household names” according to OTI. McDonald’s? Burger King? Wendy’s? Panera? All of the above? We don’t know who OTI’s customers are in this business segment. During OTI’s 2016 year-end earnings conference call on March 19, CEO, Shlomi Cohen, was asked if he could divulge who are these “household name” fast food chain customers. He suggested it would certainly be beneficial to OTI to reveal the names, but that the customers didn’t want him to do so, and that he respects his customers’ wishes. Beyond these first “thousands” of orders, Cohen was very optimistic about revenue growth selling the company’s industry leading cashless payment processing technology to fast food chains, yet he stopped short of giving specific revenue estimates. When asked for volume numbers, Cohen replied, “As I mentioned before, we are not giving guidance regarding the specific accounts, but I will say that this is only the beginning with this specific food chain. With – let’s say, with the plans we are having at the moment, the idea is to accelerate the number of systems that we are going to implement in the network.” “…only the beginning” were the words that jumped out at me. Only the beginning in an $18 billion market can really add up for a smaller, innovative technology company like OTI. Adoption rates for this technology are all about customer satisfaction. Convenience, speed, control, no lines, and the ability to customize your order are the huge benefits of using a self-checkout kiosk at a fast food restaurant. This is what’s driving the multi-billion growth industry. I recently went into a McDonald’s in my neighborhood, used the kiosk, and was thoroughly satisfied. The large, high definition LCD screen lets me just touch the food of my choice, swipe my card, and I’m done. The fast food chains, saving significantly in front-of-the-house labor costs, can divert labor to food prep, thereby offering better, faster, and more customized food and service to customers. The customer gets a better, tastier experience, the fast food chains increase revenues and save money through reduced front-of-house labor costs. OTI also has the opportunity to cash in on potential recurring revenues from each fast food transactions if it can integrate with customer loyalty programs and/or its proprietary NFC wearable tech. Fast food restaurants, including Panera, are finding kiosk orders are actually increasing sales and have a quick two-year ROI. “The inclusion of near field communication technology – our expertise – into these machines is changing operations on a global scale. It enables customers to have an intuitive, quick and seamless shopping experience,” stated Cohen in the OTI’s February press release. McDonald’s will roll out “Create Your Taste” digital self-order kiosks in 14,000 of its U.S. stores. As of November 2016, McDonald’s had already installed kiosks in 500 stores across New York, Southern California, and Florida. Wendy’s is also installing self-service kiosks at 1,000 of its approximately 6,600 restaurants by then end of 2017. Panera already has kiosks in 50% of its locations. OTI has multiple revenue streams and management is focused on increasing its transactional recurring revenue business. As indicated in its 2016 year-end conference call, the fast food industry is one of several huge opportunities for OTI. This week at the NAMA OneShow, the trade show for fast food and convenience services industry, OTI is actively expanding its customer base. As industry verticals from fast food, to gas service stations, to vending machines, to wearable tech change and evolve, cashless payment systems will be essential to each. Investors and analysts are recognizing this. Retail is going self-serve and it’s going cashless. OTI has the platform technologies that retailers need to make this transition.

A robber stole cookware from a Little Rock Wal-Mart after he showed a false receipt, then tugged the box out of an employee's hands before fleeing in a gold car Monday morning, authorities said. Police were called to the Wal-Mart at 8801 Baseline Road around 7:30 a.m. after getting a call about a theft, according to a police report. An employee told officers she saw a male and a female try to leave the store without paying for a 10-piece box set of cooking pots and pans valued at $149. When a manager confronted them, the male pulled out a receipt from another store, and the employee took the cookware back to the register, the report said. The male then grabbed the box and yanked it out of the employee's hands, scratching her forearm, the report said. He and his accomplice fled the store and drove away in a gold Sedan, the victims said. Police were reportedly unable to find either suspect or the car.

Schneider, 53, bopped around so much, the Kentwood tugboat captain earned the nickname "Hammer," as in M.C. Hammer, from his crew on the river. "He'd be dancing in Wal-Mart," said his son, Braun Schneider Jr., 31. The elder Braun was so upbeat, so energetic, so charismatic that relatives didn't think he had any enemies, certainly no one who would want to take his life. But Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office investigators say Christopher Farley, 52, fatally stabbed Braun Schneider Sr. in the back parking lot of the Westgate Tavern bar in Metairie on Thursday night (April 13) following an argument. Farley, of Metairie, was booked with second-degree murder and obstruction of justice. Braun Schneider Jr. called the killing a "cold-blooded murder." "He didn't deserve it," the younger Braun said of his father. Not a fighter Braun Schneider Sr. had just completed a 28-day stint on his boat, the Marshall B. Barnes, with Mandeville-based Florida Marine on Thursday afternoon, his son, Byron Schneider, 30, said. The two were supposed to meet up on Friday for an Easter weekend trip to Pensacola Beach. Braun Schneider Sr. stopped by the Westgate, 2725 Mississippi Ave., Metairie, for a drink that evening. Shortly after friend Tanya Arceneaux arrived at the bar, she noticed a woman arguing with Schneider. "I'm not sure what they were arguing about," Arceneaux said. But the woman called Farley, her boyfriend, to back her up in the confrontation, which led to a fight in the bar, Arceneaux said. The bartender ordered the men to take it outside, where the scuffle continued in the parking lot. Farley was on top of Schneider when Arceneaux said she spotted blood. Investigators determined Schneider was stabbed multiple times. He was pronounced dead at the scene. "He was such a nice guy," Arceneaux said. "He's not a fighter, either. I've never heard of anyone not liking him." Renaissance man Schneider was born in New Orleans and raised in Kenner. He attended Bonnabel High School in Metairie, eventually earning his GED, according to his sons. He was the youngest of three children and the only boy. Schneider grew up riding dirt bikes and fishing, said his ex-wife, Mary Ann Bajaczky. Schneider started on the river as a deckhand and worked his way up captain. "He was extremely proud of being a tugboat captain," said Byron Schneider, who noted his father loved to wear polo shirts with the company name and his title. "He was really, really proud of his job." Schneider also loved working on the water. "He was just a water bug. He loved the swamp," Braun Schneider Jr. said. Braun Schneider Sr. was the consummate outdoorsman, having mastered fishing and hunting, said his nephew, David Kott, 37. He never came back from a trip empty-handed, skills he passed on to Kott and his sons. Schneider could fix anything, his sons said, and he loved to travel. He'd been to Spain, Amsterdam, Germany, Austria, Hungary, France and many more foreign locales. "He was a Renaissance man," Braun Schneider Jr. said. "I've seen a lot of countries with my dad. There was so much more that we wanted to do." Relatives also remembered Braun Schneider Sr.'s exuberant personality. "My father was one of a kind," Braun Schneider Jr. said. "He had the biggest heart you could ever imagine." The elder Schneider was also a people person who used humor to brighten the mood or put strangers at ease. "If you just talk to him for five minutes, you had been laughing," Bajaczky said. "You could have been having a bad day, and he'll get you laughing." Life cut short Braun Schneider Sr. is survived by a host of relatives including his mother, Tawnie Eliasen; his sisters, Tawnie Schneider and Kaye Henry; his two sons; his stepchildren, Ricky Boudreaux, Randy Boudreaux, Jeff Boudreaux and Jesse Boudreaux; his grandchildren, Romy and Zoe; and several nieces, nephews, cousins and friends he considered family. Braun Schneider Sr. was preceded in death by his wife, Dee Dee, who passed away in November. Though he was still grieving her sudden loss, he was making plans to see more of the world, to visit his family and to enjoy life. "Everybody feels his life was cut so short with him being only 53," Kott said. "But he did live a life that nobody will ever achieve. I don't care how much time they're on Earth, they'll never outlive him." A wake for family members will be held at 4 p.m. Friday (April 21) at L.A. Muhleisen & Son Funeral Home, 2607 Williams Blvd., Kenner.

But the ambitious project faces an uncertain future as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs new trade barriers. Major importers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., WMT -0.39% Samsung Electronics Co. and Target Corp. TGT -0.02% see Lázaro Cárdenas as a key link between Asia’s factories and Mexico’s growing middle class. They also hope to use the port as a backdoor to the U.S., bypassing congested West Coast ports via the “Nafta Railway,” a network of track operated by U.S. railroad Kansas City Southern KSU 0.56% that can shuttle goods as far north as Memphis. APM Terminals, a unit of the world’s biggest shipping company, A.P. Moller-Maersk , AMKBY -1.11% spent five years and $568 million on the new terminal. APM hopes to spend up to $900 million to expand capacity at the terminal to rival the Port of New York and New Jersey by the end of the next decade. But what looked like a sure bet five years ago is less certain today. President Trump has threatened to penalize manufacturers that move operations to Mexico and wants to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Republicans in Congress have floated a “border-adjusted tax” that would raise the cost of imports. Any of these measures could deal a blow to U.S.-Mexico trade, shipping companies and analysts say. Mexico’s imports have grown more than 30% since 2010, according to the World Bank, and container volumes are up 60% in the past three years at Lázaro Cárdenas’ older facilities, according to trade data firm Panjiva. Auto parts make up a big part of those gains. “The port is a microcosm of global trade flows,” said Christopher Rogers, a research analyst with Panjiva. He added: “it’s very exposed to the auto industry.” Danish conglomerate Maersk, which once touted the new terminal’s “near-sourcing benefits,” a reference to manufacturers producing goods in Mexico and selling them in the U.S., now says it is focusing more on using the port to import goods for Mexico’s consumer market. In an interview this month, Maersk Chief Executive Soren Skou said “the main purpose of the terminal is to be a gateway terminal for the Mexico City market,” with cross-border trade secondary. “The U.S. administration has made a number of statements that impact our business on the positive side,” Mr. Skou said. “Then there are the discussions about trade deals, and some of the rhetoric seems more protectionist…It’s really hard for us to judge how this will affect our business.” APM’s terminal unloaded its first ship in February, and the port formally opened with a ceremony in early April attended by Mexico’s president Enrique Peña Nieto and Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen. Mexico’s government sees developing the port as a priority. In 2013, amid rising drug cartel violence and illegal smuggling, Mr. Peña Nieto deployed thousands of troops to the port and handed over its security to the navy, which still maintains a garrison there. At the ceremony earlier this month, he called the terminal “a testimony to how Mexico has been growing, how it has become a trustworthy destination…that is crucial for the transit of goods bound for the important consumer market that is Mexico, and from here to other important consumer markets.” However, in recent months, Mexico’s president has also said the country will pursue trade deals with Vietnam and Japan and work more closely with China. “Mexico’s path forward is to participate more in world trade, not just to trade with North America,” said Walter Kemmsies, an economist who specializes in ports and shipping. “The investment at Lázaro Cárdenas makes sense, because it’s a gateway to trade with Asia.” On a stiflingly hot morning in late March, giant cranes lifted hundreds of metal boxes from the container ship Charlotte Maersk amid the soft hum of robotic machinery. The new terminal features towering 300-foot-tall ship-to-shore cranes that can span the largest container ships currently plying routes between Asia to North America. The cranes can pluck two containers at a time from ships, then deposit them in piles. Robotic stacking cranes that run on electricity—rather than the usual diesel—use artificial intelligence to arrange the piles in the most time- and cost-efficient order. Such semi-automated systems are common at port terminals in the Netherlands and Singapore, but have never been used in Latin America. The facility is expected to employ about 550 people—or 250 fewer than a similar-size terminal without automation—which makes for fewer accidents and lowers container handling costs by 20%, APM says. “I’ve never seen a terminal this technologically advanced,” said Miguel Ángel Dominguez, a supervisor for cargo operations at the terminal. “It’s much safer, much more dynamic, much more mechanized.” Source: Wall Street Journal 2017-04-18 hellenicshippingnews. tweet Share Previous: Shanghai’s ambitions ride with Yangshan deep water port Next: TTI Algeciras, new services and customers arrival Related News Ship demolition prices retreat as recyclers adopt more cautious approach to the market 19/04/2017 Dry bulk market springs a surprise but sweats on slower second half 19/04/2017 Weaker capesize rates weigh down Baltic index 19/04/2017 Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The cost to the Dayton suburb of Beavercreek includes about $210,000 paid to two law firms, according to Dayton Daily News. The city's law director says outside counsel was necessary to defend Officer Sean Williams and Sgt. David Darkow. The officer fatally shot father-of-two John Crawford III in 2014 after a 911 call about someone waving a rifle at the Walmart. Police say he didn't obey commands to drop what later turned out to be an air rifle. Mr Crawford was shot in the arm and torso by Officer Williams and was taken to Dayton's Miami Valley Hospital where he later died. Following the shooting, a grand jury decided not to indict any of the officers involved on charges of either murder, reckless homicide, or negligent homicide. A federal probe for any possible civil rights violations is continuing and could go on for years.  The City of Beavercreek has spent $430,000 defending Officer Sean Williams, left, and Sgt David Darkow, right RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Desperate 911 calls released as the hunt for the Facebook... 'If you want to survive, stay home': Chilling message on... Share this article Share The city paid significantly more in legal fees for Sgt. Darkow spending more than $178,000 - 5.5 times the $32,000 paid for Officer Williams.  The Crawford family's attorney Michael Wright says the money used to defend the officers could have gone toward a settlement for the family. 'It's unfortunate that the city of Beavercreek has taken this stance and spent so much of the taxpayers money to continue to fight the Crawford family,' he said. 'This family and John's two sons deserve justice.'  The Walmart in Beavercreek where Crawford was shot as he carried an air rifle City law director Stephen McHugh said: 'The city expects to incur additional legal fees in connection with the pending litigation and investigation.  'However, because these two matters are still ongoing, I cannot comment as to why the city retained the specific legal counsel that it did or why the legal fees for Sgt. Darkow’s representation are higher than those of officer Williams.' Officer Williams has remained on administrative duty throughout the duration of the probe.

Myrtle Beach police officers were called about 8 p.m. Monday to the 1500 block of Yaupon Drive in reference to a strong armed robbery. The victim told police she was walking from a hotel with her 88-year-old husband when she asked the suspect for directions to Wal-Mart. She said the suspect gave her and her husband inaccurate directions, having them head the wrong way. She told police the suspect then got off his bike and threw her to the ground, the report states. She said he began pulling at her purse, trying to take it from her, police said. The woman’s husband kicked the suspect to defend her, and the suspect then threw him to the ground as well, spilling beer on him, the report states. The victim had minor scratches on her knees and told police her head hurt, the report says. A witness nearby heard the woman’s screams for help and went over to help after seeing the suspect battle the victim for her purse, police said. The witness said he yelled at the suspect, who then got back on his bike, asked why he was hit, then pedaled away, the report says.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon TORONTO — Grocery basket price deflation appears to be tapering and that is good news for Canadian food retailers, according to two industry reports. While March results suggest grocery deflation continued in the industry, the level of deflation was lower than February’s, analyst Peter Sklar of BMO Capital Markets wrote in an analysis published Monday. BMO’s grocery basket survey predicts that Statistics Canada will report grocery deflation of less than 4 per cent for the month of March, Sklar said. Statistics Canada reported February deflation of 4.1 per cent in its Consumer Price Index of food purchased from stores, and the agency is scheduled to release CPI data for March on April 21. Food prices began going down in the United States in December, 2015, and in Canada the deflationary food trend started about three quarters later, in September 2016. Related Print media may be struggling but the retail store flyer’s popularity is soaring Grocery prices hike to be modest in 2017 due to ‘very intense’ competition between companies: report If lower food prices are passed on to consumers, food price deflation can be seen as partly beneficial, but it weighs on the profits of grocery retailers because their sales and general and administrative costs typically continue to increase. Canada’s grocery market became significantly more price-competitive prior to and during the deflationary period that began last year. Walmart, Loblaw, Metro and Sobeys lowered shelf prices in selected categories amid an ongoing market share battle that has intensified with the rising grocery sales at Costco and Walmart in Canada, but that too could be letting up. “The trend we observed in February of Loblaw cutting prices more significantly than other grocers on a month-over-month basis appears to have run its course in Toronto and Montreal in March,” Sklar wrote in his report. “Overall, we believe that the smaller magnitude of deflation in March is a positive development for the Canadian grocers, and there has been some modest level of recovery in grocery prices on a month-over-month basis.” Produce was the primary driver of deflation in both discount banners and conventional grocery stores, Sklar added. While he expects grocery prices will still experience “significant” deflation in March, it will be less than in January and February, Sklar said. “We continue to believe that deflation could endure through the third quarter of 2017 before returning to modest inflation in the fourth quarter of 2017. However, if sequential basket pricing continues to increase, the first quarter of 2017 should be the peak deflationary quarter.” Keith Howlett, retailing analyst at Desjardins Securities in Toronto, said in a report Monday that food price deflation in the United States also appeared to have moderated in March: grocery price deflation at stores was 0.9 per cent in March in the U.S., compared with deflation of 1.7 per cent in February, while restaurant or “food-away-from-home” experienced inflation of 2.4 per cent. “If current food-at-home pricing momentum continues, the U.S. is likely to return to food-at-home inflation in the near term,” Howlett said in the report. If prices increase by roughly 0.02 per cent year over year for three consecutive months, inflation will reappear in June, the analyst predicts. This is significant for Canada and Canadian grocery retailers, Howlett said, “because the agricultural and food industries of Canada and the U.S. are, generally speaking, integrated,” with the exceptions being the supply-managed categories of dairy and poultry in Canada.

Image: Connor McKenna Jet.com is looking for great talent for its Dublin office by Jenny Darmody 3 hours ago2 Shares Jet.com was at Career Zoo last month looking for great talent and showcasing what it does best. From humble beginnings in 2014, to becoming the second-biggest online retail site in America, Jet.com has more than made a name for itself. The company has grown from 30 people in 2015 to 2,000 today and, since its acquisition by multinational corporation Walmart, it is now looking for even more talent in Dublin. Speaking to Siliconrepublic.com earlier this year, co-founder Mike Hanrahan said that the talent pool in Dublin is incredible. “Every major tech company in the US has a presence in Dublin, from Microsoft to Google and Twitter.” With this in mind, it’s no wonder that Jet was at Career Zoo last month. There, we spoke to the company’s Dublin site lead, David Ryan. He said he was there to talk to people, announce Jet’s arrival and showcase what it does. “Jet is not shoppable in Europe but it is the second-biggest online retail site in America,” he said. “We’re looking for great talent, I think we’re going to find it here.” Hiring Now Be part of a globally successful team Fidelity International: A truly unique proposition A dynamic and rapidly expanding company Help develop the future of sales and trading The Walmart acquisition was completed in September 2016 and, at $3bn, it was the largest of its kind for an online start-up. We asked Ryan how such a massive acquisition might affect Jet. “It’s a challenge that we’re willing to accept,” he said. “It hasn’t really affected the culture at all, but when you’re dealing with something like 250m pricing updates a day, 4.5bn cart calculations, 3,000 searches a second – that’s an incredibly engaging challenge to operate within.” As part of the expansion, Jet is looking for talented people to join the team, and Ryan said that there are many types of roles available at the moment. “We’re looking for people who are interested in functional programming, so it might be Scala, it could be C#,” he said. Jet is also looking for people who are interested in big APIs, security, search and DevOps. Ryan said: “We are an engine that’s going to ensure continued growth for Walmart.com.” Tweet Share Email Share More Share Pin This Reddit In-Depth: More on Career Zoo Related: e-commerce, software developers, Dublin, jobs By Jenny Darmody Jenny joined Silicon Republic in 2016 as part of the Careers team.

News Suspect says 'I'm coming in' under police Facebook post Associated Press Florida police say a suspect in a theft at a Wal-Mart identified herself on Facebook after seeing a post offering a reward. Winter Haven Police posted a video Thursday on Facebook showing a couple pushing a cart out of the store April 7. Police said they hadn't paid for their items. The post offered a potential reward to tipsters. Ninety minutes later, 29-year-old Elaina West of Lake Wales left a comment identifying herself in the video. West wrote: "Ain't no reward I'm coming in." Police said West surrendered late Thursday. She was held Sunday at the Polk County jail on $1,000 bond for grand theft. Her husband, 30-year-old Patrick West, was held on $8,500 bond for grand theft and drug charges. Jail records didn't show whether either had an attorney. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Bubblebum has teamed up with Spanish firm Oblumi, which has developed the 'tapp'. It connects to mobile phones and converts it into a digital infrared thermometer. Bubblebum founder Grainne Kelly has now landed a distribution deal worth £3m with Oblumi to exclusively distribute the device in the UK and Ireland over a period of five years. The company already sells its child booster seats into more than 1,000 stores in the UK and across the US. Ms Kelly, who is from Londonderry and has her firm based at the Catalyst Inc Innovation Centre in the city, says the firm has also secured a new deal to sell her car booster seats into 1,700 Target stores in the US. "I have created and founded Bubblebum, and we have been exporting around the world for the last seven years," she said. "We are in Walmart (in the US) and Halfords. We have been looking at adding more products to our range." She said she was contacted by Spanish firm Oblumi, which was keen to break into the UK and Ireland market with its smartphone thermometer. "We thought, people are doing this, but don't know how to get it to market," Ms Kelly said. "Oblumi contacted us... I knew their message was off for the UK. I said, we can do this for you, but we need exclusive distribution to the UK and Ireland, with the option of the US. "The product is a smartphone thermometer. But it's not just that, it also logs all of the data. "So, if the baby is at home with granny, and she is checking the temperature, the mother and father can also check that. It also reminds how much paracetamol to take - reminders of when to take the temperature. "We will also take this a step further for the elderly. For example, when my dad was sick, he got out of hospital, he couldn't remember when to take his temperature of medicine - we had to manually record all of that." The device works for both Android and Apple phones. The company now employs 12 staff - doubling the size of the team to meet demand for its existing products. "(The thermometer product) is a pretty significant deal. We are also in another 1,000 stores in the UK and Target in the US (with the booster seat)," Ms Kelly said. "In the past two weeks we have signed Walmart in Chile and we have already doubled staff numbers." She said there has already been "great interest" in the new smartphone thermometer. "This is the first device of its kind on the market to date," she said. "As a parent of a child who had frequent bouts of fever, I am acutely aware of the precautions people need to take with infants and the confusion that lies with tracking temperature and medication. Our objective is to alleviate these concerns and allow parents and carer's to rely on the Oblumi device as a practical solution. "In addition to a being a reliable thermometer for a family member, the Oblumi tapp can also check the temperature of liquids with accuracy and speed such as the temperature of a baby's bottle or bath water, a constant concern for parents."

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 19 April 2017 by Military News Susan Foster, Partner, Perkins Coie LLP to Speak at TKG’s LIVE Webcast (1888PressRelease) April 19, 2017 – The Knowledge Group/The Knowledge Congress Live Webcast Series, the leading producer of regulatory focused webcasts, has announced today that Susan Foster, Partner, Perkins Coie LLP will speak at the Knowledge Group’s webcast entitled: „New Considerations Under Employment and Antitrust Law When Creating Restrictive Covenants.” For further details, please visit: https://theknowledgegroup.org/event-homepage/?event_id=2653 About Susan Foster Susan Foster is a partner in Perkins Coie’s Litigation practice and the Firm-wide Chair of the Firm’s Antitrust and Unfair Competition practice.

Litigators counsel clients in a range of areas, from antitrust and unfair competition, to privacy, patent litigation, product liability, class action defense, insurance, securities, white collar and more. Event Synopsis: Restrictive covenants are important tools that can be vital for a company’s success. However, they should always be drafted with considerable care to avoid court scrutiny and ultimately be enforceable. Employment agreement cases may result in significant damages which employers must always keep in mind. Moreover, restrictive covenants should always be reviewed and updated to comply with various federal and state laws on employment and antitrust. In this LIVE Webcast, a panel of thought leaders and practitioners assembled by The Knowledge Group will discuss the latest and significant updates related to restrictive covenants and non-compete agreements. They will also review recent case law on the topic and give insights on how courts determine whether or not restrictive covenant clauses in an employment agreement are enforceable. The audience will learn best practices in drafting and enforcing restrictive covenants in an employment contract without running afoul of employment and antitrust laws. About The Knowledge Group/The Knowledge Congress Live Webcast Series The Knowledge Group was established with the mission to produce unbiased, objective, and educational live webinars that examine industry trends and regulatory changes from a variety of different perspectives. The goal is to deliver a unique multilevel analysis of an important issue affecting business in a highly focused format.

Whorley spent 16 years and four months in prison before he was released Jan. 3. Four months later, he was charged with killing John Douglas Agnew, dismembering his body, and placing some of his body parts in a duffel bag that Winston-Salem police said was recently bought at Wal-Mart. Detectives in Randolph County Sheriff’s Office found human remains belonging to Agnew in Randleman. According to a search warrant filed in Richmond County, where Whorley was arrested, Whorley listed Agnew as a friend in his official contact list in 2001 and as an approved visitor while Whorley was an inmate. Winston-Salem police said Agnew was stabbed multiple times in the neck and chest. Whorley and Michael Antonio Whorley, 19 at the time, were arrested in January 2001 for a string of armed robberies. They were also accused of shooting Oscar Carranza in the shoulder and upper thigh after he tried to calm the robbers who had threatened his fiance, Jackie Garcia, who worked at the Circle K on Shattalon Drive. It is not clear from court records whether Michael Whorley and Adrion Whorley were related, but they both lived at the same address. They were each charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, inflicting serious injury. Because Adrion Whorley was a juvenile, a hearing had to be held to determine if his case would stay in juvenile court or be transferred to Forsyth Superior Court. On March 26, 2001, Judge Roland Hayes of Forsyth District Court ruled that Adrion Whorley would be treated as an adult, according to court records. Whorley pleaded guilty to the assault charge, six counts of armed robbery and one county of possession of stolen goods on Aug. 25, 2001 in Forsyth Superior Court. He was sentenced to about 15 years to 22 years in prison. Michael Whorley was sentenced to about 22 years in prison and is scheduled to be released in November of this year, according to records from the N.C. Department of Adult Correction. Adrion Whorley is in the Forsyth County Jail with no bond allowed on a murder charge in Agnew’s death and a bond of $100,000 on a charge of concealing the death. He is scheduled to appear in Forsyth District Court on May 4. Agnew’s family released a statement Tuesday. “We again extend our deepest and most sincere gratitude to members of law enforcement, community and friends for their support during this unspeakable tragedy,” said LeShea Agnew, an Agnew family representative. “We now place our united faith in the judicial system as investigators continue their work and also ask anyone with additonal information to assist officials in this ongoing investigation. Your combined prayers continue to uplift and comfort our entire family in the wake of this devastation. We decline to comment further until our family can come to terms with our unimaginable loss as we await the outcome of this case.” mhewlett@wsjournal.com (336) 727-7326 @mhewlettWSJ +1  Whorley Courtesy of Forsyth County Detention Center +1  Agnew Courtesy of the Agnew family Tags John Douglas Agnew Law Crime Adrion Whorley Michael Antonio Whorley Criminal Law Armed Robbery Charge Prison Jackie Garcia Michael Hewlett Follow Michael Hewlett Close Get email notifications on Michael Hewlett daily!

These teenagers speak dozens of languages, and hail from a dozen African nations. They fled brutal civil war, famine, oppressive regimes to find themselves here, at a pre-prom fete in this once-dying New England mill town, revived by an influx of some 7,500 immigrants over the last 16 years. Rodrigue smiled and waved at his daughter, proud she is a part of it. "It will help her in life," he said. "The world is not all white."

Maine is the whitest state in America, 95 percent white, and its citizens were abruptly confronted with hundreds of black Muslims, traumatized by war and barely able to speak English. (AP Photo/David Goldman) Rodrigue believes the refugees resuscitated his town - plugging the population drain that had threatened to cripple it, opening shops and restaurants in boarded-up storefronts. But he also agrees with Donald Trump that there should be no more of them, at least not now. His working-class community, built along the banks of the Androscoggin River in the whitest state in America, is a place that some point to as proof that refugee integration can work. And yet for the first time in 30 years, voters in Androscoggin County chose a Republican for president, endorsing Trump's nativist zeal against the very sort of immigrants who share their streets and their schools. The mills that line the river sit mostly shuttered today, and a quarter of children grow up poor in the county of 107,000. So Trump's supporters here tie their embrace of his immigration clampdown to their economic anxieties. "There's got to be a point in time when you have to say, 'Whoa, let's get the working people back up. Let's bring the money in. But they keep coming, keep coming," Rodrigue said. "I guess it just boils down to: What's enough?" No one invited the Somali refugees to Lewiston. They fled bullets and warlords to eventually be chosen for resettlement in big American cities. In early 2001, a few refugee families struggling to afford housing in Portland ventured 30 miles north and found a city in retreat. Empty downtown stores were ringed by sagging apartment buildings. The refugees saw possibility in Lewiston's decay. Friends and families followed. The town morphed in a matter of months into a laboratory for what happens when culture suddenly shifts. Maine's population is 94 percent white, and its citizens were abruptly confronted with hundreds of black Muslims, barely able to speak English. Ardo Mohamed fled Mogadishu in the 1990s, when militiamen burst into her home and started shooting. She watched her father die, as the rest of the family escaped into the woods. They wound up in refugee camps, separated for years, then finally Atlanta, then Lewiston in 2001. "We wanted to be safe," said the mother of five, "just like you do." When the refugees began arriving, Tabitha Beauchesne was a student at Lewiston High School. Her new classmates were poor, but Beauchesne was poor, too. It felt to her then, and it still feels to her now, that the refugees got more help than her family. "They just seemed to take over," she said. Beauchesne doesn't consider herself racist, though acknowledges that race and religion likely play a role in her sense that the refugees overwhelmed her community. She's now a stay-at-home mother of two, and she left Lewiston to move to another school district in the county because she believes immigrant students monopolize teachers' attention. Once a Barack Obama supporter, Beauchesne turned to Trump - and she cheers his efforts to curb the flow of refugees into the U.S. She wants Trump to design a tax system that funnels less of her money to aiding those from other countries. "I just don't like giving money away that's not benefiting me and, not to sound selfish, but then seeing it benefit other people," she said. "As a business owner, my husband wouldn't donate $500 to the Salvation Army if we couldn't afford it. Our country needs to do the same thing." Taxpayers do help some of the immigrants, whose population exploded as Somali refugees gave way to those seeking asylum, from Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, a dozen nations in all. Still, many of the newcomers work, said Catherine Besteman, a professor of anthropology at Maine's Colby College. Maine's immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa made $136.6 million in income in 2014, and paid $40 million in taxes, according to one report from a bipartisan think-tank. But Besteman said they work invisible jobs: they take out trash at hotels, do the laundry at the hospital. People don't see them working, so it's easy to assume they are living off handouts. Republican leaders - from the president to the governor to the local GOP - have seized on the resentment that breeds. The county Republican party routinely rails against what it calls "the refugee racket," and complains that the school system is forced to accommodate 34 languages. Lewiston School Superintendent Bill Webster acknowledges that does cost money. But he has a statistic he likes to share with critics. An average of 78.3 percent of immigrant students graduate from his district within five years, compared to an average of 73.3 percent of native-born students. And now some of those immigrant kids are going off to college to get degrees, as teachers, doctors, engineers. Two years ago, immigrant children led the high school soccer team to win the state championship - a moment heralded as a triumph of cultural cooperation. "If the immigrant population hadn't happened," Webster said, "Lewiston would be a community that was contracting, and potentially in a downward death spiral." Yet many on the outskirts of Lewiston have quietly stewed over the change in their county - and Trump's "America First" message rings especially true with them. Thirty miles up the highway, David Lovewell stood in the parking lot of the paper mill where he used to work, before it shed hundreds of jobs. Now he runs a logging company with his sons just outside the town of Livermore Falls. A few months ago, business got so bad he laid off eight employees. He looked down at his sneakers, bought for $25 at Walmart. There used to be two shoe factories nearby. Lovewell doesn't like to talk about immigration. He went on a cruise to Belize with his wife several years ago, and bought a carving from an old man whose hands were so worn from years of whittling they looked like leather. He remembers those hands still, and the man's dirt-floor shack with no doors and his skinny dog and the kids riding around on broken bicycles. "I struggled with it, when he did the travel ban," Lovewell said of Trump. "At the same time, I'm seeing ... people losing their jobs. Why are we so worried about immigrants coming into our country when we can't really take care of our own people?" So Lovewell looks to Trump to strike a better balance - to build an economy where his sons don't have to battle to barely get by and, after that, design an immigration system that keeps America's promise of open arms. "I guess it could sound like bigotry," he said. "But we're hurting. Americans are hurting." ___ AP data journalist Angeliki Kastanis contributed to this report.

Shaleh also worries about the many refugees who are suffering in Somalia and other parts of Africa, where famine remains a huge issue. "We got that chance (to come to America)," he said.

One of the hardest places to do that is at the automaker's sprawling plant in central Kentucky, a state where nearly 90 percent of energy still comes from coal. Butt points out a new engine assembly line, where a conveyor belt moves in a slow circle. He says it was specially designed with a more efficient motor. There are also enormous fans overhead and LED lights, all changes that save millions. "I mean, what company doesn't want to reduce their energy bill," he says. That's the business case for going green. And in a lot of places around the country, solar and wind are now the cheapest energy option. But a few years ago, Toyota decided that by 2050 all of its operations, all around the world, should be zero-carbon. It's part of a larger business shift. In Kentucky, General Motors, Ford, Walmart, L'Oreal and others also have big goals to reduce emissions. Even the state's beloved bourbon makers are starting to look at renewables. "There's not enough renewable energy being manufactured right now for all of us to do what we say we want to do," Butt says. That's true globally, he says, and it's especially true in Kentucky, where people like to say coal isn't just the economy, it's the culture. "We're a coal state, we're proud to be a coal state, we're sentimental about our attachment to coal," says Charles Snavely, secretary of Kentucky's Energy and Environment Cabinet. Before this job, Snavely spent 35 years in the coal industry. His office is now working with companies — he calls them customers — to help develop renewable energy. But Snavely says he struggles with whether "the growth of renewables [comes] at the expense of coal. Is it a bigger pie, or is someone taking a slice of our pie?" Kentucky, unlike many other states, has no mandate to require a certain share of renewable energy. The state joined two dozen others in a lawsuit challenging President Barack Obama's signature climate policy, the Clean Power Plan, which would have shuttered hundreds of coal-fired power plants. Snavely says coal built his state's economy, creating some of the cheapest power in the country. "We have industries in Kentucky that would not be here if we didn't have such low electricity rates," he says. President Trump's order to start dismantling the climate regulation was a victory for Kentucky. And yet, it may not do much to stop the steady decline of coal. "The future is renewables and the large corporations that want renewables," says Jim Gardner, who used to regulate power companies as a member of Kentucky's Public Service Commission. Two years ago, Gardner was struck by an encounter with a local man who worked remotely for Facebook. He told Gardner that big corporations were actually deciding where to expand based on where they could get renewable energy. "He made it seem like there was literally a list with a lot of states with big X's marked in," says Gardner, "so that Facebook and others were not looking because [some states] were not going to be open to renewables." The Public Service Commission worried the state was missing out. It quietly issued an official statement — "a clear signal to people outside of the state," says Gardner — that if a big customer wanted renewable energy, Kentucky's utilities could cut a special deal to provide it. That gave utilities permission to offer renewable energy. But they still face challenges to produce it. The state's cheap coal makes it harder for renewables to compete, and to see a return on investment. What's more, Kenya Stump, of the Energy and Environment Cabinet, says Kentucky has only moderate potential for solar power, and not much at all for wind. She says hydro power holds the most promise. Stump is working with companies that want to develop renewable power, but she doesn't foresee a major spike anytime soon. "Right now renewables are starting to compete on costs, but not reliability," she says. But she adds that once battery technology develops and solar or wind power can be stored, "all bets are off." Kentucky's utilities are also highly regulated. An energy activist says he's been heartened by a shift in the state's attitude, but thinks officials could do a lot more to encourage renewables. "The sun in Kentucky is as strong as it is in North Carolina and Ohio and New York, where the solar industry is employing tens of thousands of people," says Andy McDonald of the Kentucky Solar Energy Society. "Kentucky is not limited by our resources; it's limited by our policies." None of those challenges is stopping a slow transition. "This tract is about 60 acres," says David Crews, standing in a freshly mowed field where East Kentucky Power Cooperative is about to install 32,000 solar panels. It will be one of the state's first utility-scale solar farms, and it's there by popular demand — from businesses. Crews says some companies don't mind paying a bit more to meet their sustainability goals. East Kentucky Power has no plans to build another coal plant. Crews says just because the new president doesn't want to limit carbon emissions, doesn't mean the next one won't. "The seesawing of regulations when we're trying to make a 50-year investment, it will drive you crazy," he says. "And that wouldn't be good for our customer base." The utility is marketing its new solar farm, and if demand is strong enough Crews says it will add more panels. At Toyota's plant in central Kentucky, Kevin Butt envisions installing solar panels on the roof. The company is also researching fuel cell technology, seeking the breakthrough that could help it eliminate carbon emissions. But for now, he's getting creative about finding renewable energy where he can. He drives me down a rutted dirt road, through towering brown hills. It's a landfill, and here and there, things stick up. "The black tube coming out," he says pointing, "it's a methane capture well." The methane is released as the trash rots. When it goes into the air, methane is a dirty greenhouse gas, but last year Toyota set up a generator here to turn it into clean electricity. The power is sent through an underground line, straight to the Toyota plant 6 miles away, bypassing the local utility altogether. "They either have to put it in their system," Butt says, "or people will be looking at alternate ways to get that energy in a renewable form." Copyright 2017 NPR.

He brought it home and returned to his office, where, at the most recent count, he keeps 11 mechanical keyboards. Collecting them is his new hobby. And he's taking it very seriously. He refused to eat anything anywhere near his precious keyboard menagerie. He compared it to "storing newborn babies under the booths of Dennys." I, Cecilia, told him that's not relatable. "99% of gamers are more likely to keep a box of Cheez-Its by their computers than a bag of moist towelettes," I responded. As someone who once received a Geek Squad PC diagnostic report calling my keyboard "malodorous," I am a firm believer in snacking while PC gaming. Sure, I have some regrets. But my desk would feel naked without at least one type of snack or drink on it. Anyway, what am I supposed to do between Overwatch matches? Fahey and I disagree about whether it is a cardinal sin to snack near your gaming rig. So we have some pretty, um, conflicting advice on how to do it. Our tips on snacking while PC gaming below: How To Spare Your Keyboard, Which Should Be Nowhere Near Your Snacks, by Mike Fahey This is a $US150 ($198) keyboard with $US180 ($238) key caps. It could use some melted chocolate. I am the Snacktaku guy, but I am also the Keytaku guy, and while those two guys don't always see eye to eye, perhaps they can come together to teach Kotaku's resident anime expert a thing or two about safe snacking. Don't eat anywhere near your keyboard The easiest way to avoid gunking up your expensive mechanical keyboard with crumbs and drinks and various accumulations of questionable biomatter is to excuse yourself, get up from your chair and wander into another room. The living room is nice. Maybe step outside and have yourself a Hot Pocket. Oh, or the bathroom. I know some folks shy away from bathroom eating, but it always seemed so efficient to me, like opening Christmas presents at the trash dump. Maybe that's a bad analogy. Another good option, don't leave enough room for food. Eat near your desk, but not at your desk Fine, you are hungry, and you can't step away from World of Warcraft long enough to eat in an area specifically designed for such things. You don't have to be hunched over your keyboard, crumbling potato chips into your maw while exploring Dire Maw. Look to your left. Or maybe your right. If you have space on either side of you, put the food there. Maybe get a tray table from Walmart for $US10 ($13) or something. Or just build a tower of snacks, turning away from your game now and again to sink your face into it. The key to clean keyboard eating is keeping the food away from the keyboard. Keep wipes handy. Air is all around us. Assign yourself a snacky cup You really can't just turn to the side? OK fine. Let's minimise the damage then. It's not really the eating over the keyboard that does most of the harm, but the oil and crumbs on your fingertips that do the most damage. Greasy fingers can rub the legends right off of cheaper keycaps, and those tiny crumbs you don't see might not feel like much, but together in the nooks and crannies of your lovely mechanical marvel they can cause a real problem. So do this. Go into the kitchen, get a big plastic cup and fill it with chips. Or Cheetos. Or pizza rolls. Or cake frosting. Look, I don't know what you eat at your keyboard. I just know that if it goes from cup to mouth, your fingers won't hurt the keyboard that's showing them so much love. Buy a cheap-arse keyboard for when you can't help yourself Why do I own so many different mechanical keyboards? Part of it is a healthy obsession. Totally healthy. Such a great obsession you guys. But really, I want to experience all the mechanical keyboard market has to offer, from mass-produced boards with big names to do-it-yourself kits. I want to know the feel of all the switches, from Cherry MX to Topre to buckling spring. I have different keyboards for different moods. No reason I shouldn't have one more for when I want to slobber KFC all over my desk. I can buy a keyboard for under $US10 ($13) on Amazon and have it here by tomorrow. It probably won't have fancy N-key rollover or dedicated gaming macro keys. The response times won't be nearly as fast, but let's face it, if you're not focused on the game enough to forego eating until it's done, then you probably don't need to worry about the finer details. Just plug in your shit keyboard and dribble some of that Szechaun nugget sauce all over it, Morty. Seriously though, don't eat near your keyboard. You want to eat and game? Go sit on the couch and clog up your Xbox One controller with chip grease. There's nothing more exciting than picking up a preowned game controller and then spending a half hour digging brown and yellow stuff out of the seams with a paper clip. Much more entertaining than being curled up under your computer desk and crying while cradling a broken $US200 ($265) keyboard. Wait a Minute. How To Snack While Also Playing Video Games And Feel Good About It, by Cecilia D'Anastasio I was legitimately shocked to learn that a lot of people — especially at Kotaku — are offended by the idea of snacking by a computer, which says a lot about the kind of people I hang with. Probably, the naysayers are picturing this: Or, at worst, this: Dear readers, it is nothing of the sort. Even I am disgusted a little by this extremely staged and unrealistic snacking experience. I now understand that some people whisper little keyboard prayers each time the word "dinner" is evoked near a computer. You're different from me and that's ok. It's possible that you spent a lot of money on your keyboard (or eleven keyboards) and its well-being makes you nervous. I will justify my controversial habits by noting that gaming is for fun. As a rule, it's good to be a chill gamer. Snacks are fun, too, and enhance gaming experiences by keeping you fuelled and happy. As long as you insert them directly into your mouth, you should be ok. I promise. You don't need to be stressed out by your free time activity. Eat a cookie. Drink a beer. Let me walk you through acceptable snacking while PC gaming etiquette. Pick the right snacks The best strategy is buying snacks you can grab a quick handful of between matches. The snack must not leave residue. It must be structurally sound, dry and not very crumbly. Grease is unacceptable. Cheez-Its, pretzels, popcorn, grapes, coated candies (i.e. Skittles), select cookies, trail mix, jerky or dried fruit are all great options. Unless you're a bad eater, they won't crumb on your keyboard. Dropping one is not the end of the world. And, with your hands, there's less risk of doing so. For snack inspiration, go to a local LAN cafe. Their owners have a vested interest in maintaining their PCs while selling patrons snacks. One I frequent offers M&Ms, Cheez-Its, Swedish Fish, Hot Pockets and things along those lines. Shun the wrong snacks Food you eat with a utensils, like leftover Chinese, is risky. On the off chance it drops on your keyboard, you're in trouble. Food with any sort of flavour dusting, like Cheetos or Doritos or flavoured chips, are not a good idea. That stuff accumulates in between and under your keys — especially if your keyboard is mechanical. You would have to get up and wash your hands after each handful to pull that off, or keep hand wipes by your computer, which smell weird and might make your fingers slippery. Snack placement The worst thing about the above pictures is not actually my choice or quantity of snacks, but the location of the Cheez-It box. It is on top of my mouse. This, friends, is a PC snacking sin. If you are right-handed, this is where you put your snacks: Snacks must be accessible for quick bites but far enough away from your mouse that they will not compromise your gaming abilities. Also, pick one snack, not many. I accept your complaint that sweet and savoury snacks are better when alternated, but place them far from your gaming appendages. The disaster situation is your mouse crashing into a bag of Doritos on its way to snipe an enemy. Keyboard maintenance The pictured keyboard at my desk is a Corsair mechanical keyboard. It is very nice. Also, it keeps my housemates awake. I live in New York and the walls are thin and I just cannot subject other humans who help me pay rent to my very bad Overwatch habits. I do not use that keyboard anymore. This is my normal setup: With the crappy keyboard, I'll wipe it down every once in a while or, maybe, spray canned air into it upside-down. But let's talk about the mechanical keyboard maintenance, because probably, that's what you're here for. Because mechanical keyboards are very expensive, it's important to take good care of them. Snack build-up makes the key inputs slower. You know that. Also, it's gross and could attract pests. Worst-case scenario: You turn your keyboard upside-down and a heavy storm of crumbs comes tumbling out. The issue is that you're a messy eater. Not that you chose to eat there. So, to get rid of inevitable dust on top of the keyboard, use a small brush or a can of compressed air. To clean its guts, turn the keyboard over and use that compressed air again onto a table. If you have a small, handheld vacuum with a brush extension, you could run that along the top. Finish with a disinfectant wipe. Let it dry. I'm not going to tell you to take out all your keys, wash and dry them and put them back. I won't tell you to kiss each input or sing them lullabies before bed. If that's a fun thing for you, go ahead and do it. If it's not, allow me to remind you that games are for fun. Readers, you've seen our advice. Choose wisely about which tips to follow.

They even have a name for it: the "spring food gap." It's a time of the year when donations are sorely needed. "When I think about hunger, I really think of it as a sense of hopelessness,” said Scott Marshall with Feeding America Eastern Wisconsin. "You know you hit January, February, and March you see the shelves deplete, deplete, deplete." Marshall said that one in four citizens in Milwaukee is living in hunger, and half of those are children. One of the biggest corporations in the world is stepping in to help. "The food banks tend to run dry during the spring time and it’s just a great way to get those food banks restocked," said Joshua Moon, store manager at the Walmart in Brown Deer. The "Fight Hunger, Spark Change" campaign is underway at every Walmart nationwide. "Every time you purchase one of their products (Campbell, Kraft, Pepsi, Heinz, and General Mills) they will make a donation that will lead to meals that will feed hungry people right here in Wisconsin," said Marshall. You can donate at the register or when you shop online. Also, make sure you use the hashtag #FightHunger on social media to help make a difference. “We started off with a $1.5 million donation to the food bank through social media,” said Moon. “We want to raise that to a $3 million total donation,” The fight hunger spark change campaign runs through May 15 at every Walmart store nationwide.

Share This Article Police say a driver rammed three patrol cars Tuesday afternoon as he led them on a chase from Centerville to Farmington amid rush-hour traffic. Centerville Police Department officers eventually arrested a 22-year-old suspect about 5 p.m. — but not before he slammed a Farmington Police Department vehicle head-on and evaded a police blockade, a sergeant said. Nobody was injured in the incident, police say, though the suspect was taken to the hospital as a precaution. Centerville Sgt. Zan Robison said officers responded to a call just after 3:30 p.m. about someone trying to forge a check at the Cyprus Credit Union in the Centerville Wal-Mart, 221 W. Parish Lane. The man fled the scene before police arrived. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Thirty minutes later, a Centerville detective saw the suspect's pickup truck driving near an Interstate 15 on-ramp. The detective tried to stop the truck, Robison said, but the vehicle took off, driving north along the I-15 emergency lane because the freeway was congested. Officers opted not to pursue the man along the emergency lane, Robison said. Police again saw the pickup — which they later determined was stolen — parked in Farmington, near 200 North and 300 East. The truck again sped away, Robison said, before turning down a dead-end street near Lagoon. Patrol cars tried to box the pickup in, to no avail. "The suspect turned around and accelerated quickly, hit a marked unit at a good rate of speed, causing damage to both vehicles," Robison said. The pickup struck the patrol car hard enough to move it out of the way, Robison said. Minutes later, the pickup evaded a police car trying to block Park Lane in Farmington. Finally, Robison said, officers boxed the vehicle in on Shepard Creek Parkway in Farmington. The driver again tried to get enough momentum to slam two patrol SUVs out of the way, Robison said, but he was unsuccessful. "He was pretty determined to get away," Robison said. lramseth@sltrib.com Twitter: @lramseth   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR NEWS Huntsman says University of Utah 'power grab' is behind firing of acclaimed researcher from cancer i Complaints mount against Utah judge who at rape sentencing called ex-Mormon bishop a 'good man' Changing China: The nation places a heavy bet on One Belt, One Road Salt Lake City debuts on list of ozone-polluted areas McMullin owes nearly $670,000 for his failed presidential bid Subpoenas indicate broadening criminal probe related to UTA developments Salt Lake City golf courses are set to offer variable pricing, more discounts ELEVATE You may be procrastinating on your taxes if...   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Traffic Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

Construction on new Aldi in Savoy to get started SAVOY — Construction equipment should arrive this week to begin work on the new Aldi in Savoy. The discount grocery store is expected to open late September, Savoy Village Manager Dick Helton said Tuesday at the town’s economic development commission meeting. “We had a meeting with them yesterday to lay some groundwork on how they’re going to proceed,” he said. “The construction trailer is sitting there along with a big dumpster. They’ll be moving equipment in this week and starting the earth work.” The 18,000-square-foot store will have an entrance directly onto Dunlap Avenue just north of the Christie Clinic, so drivers in that area may experience some delays. “There probably are going to be a few days it’s going to be impacted,” Helton said. “Their main entrance is going to be off Dunlap, so that means a lot of trucks and equipment will be going in and out of there.” With the addition of Aldi, Savoy will have three grocery stores along with Walmart and Schnuck’s. Those two stores could be affected in the short term, but Helton expects that in the long term they’ll be all right. “There’s the fear that this will have an impact on the other two stores. Initially, it will. That’s just the way it happens,” he said. “But six months to a year from now, everything will even out. It’s a different clientele that goes to Aldi than goes to the other two.” He added: “We talked to both Schnuck’s and Walmart, and neither one of them had an issue. They said, the more the merrier.” Savoy has been courting Aldi for over a decade, Helton said, so he’s glad they’re finally here. “We started working on Aldi back in ‘06, at various times, and at various locations around the community,” he said. “They’re interested in the community. They know they need a presence here, not only because of Savoy but the surrounding area.” “It will be a great addition to this part of the community,” he added. “And it’s filling in a spot that has been open there for a long, long time that needs to be filled in.” Sections (3):News, Local, Business More Local Ex-boyfriend faces charges of home invasion Visit to sheriff's office yields new arrest in gas-station holdup Gambling-parlor robbery under investigation One Danville school placed on 'precautionary' lockdown More Local Ex-boyfriend faces charges of home invasion Visit to sheriff's office yields new arrest in gas-station holdup Gambling-parlor robbery under investigation One Danville school placed on 'precautionary' lockdown Join the Conversation Comments News-Gazette.com embraces discussion of both community and world issues.

"DELIVERANCE" EP ON APRIL 21 MARKS THE ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF PRINCE'S PASSING; EP DISC AVAILABLE NATIONWIDE JUNE 2 AT TARGET, WALMART AND ALL MAJOR BRICK AND MORTAR RETAILERS News provided by RMA (Rogue Music Alliance) Apr 18, 2017, 20:49 ET Share this article VANCOUVER, Wash., April 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- In honor of the one year anniversary of Pop icon Prince's passing, RMA (Rogue Music Alliance) is releasing a special six song EP titled DELIVERANCE, of new, undiscovered studio recordings from 2006-2008 this Friday, April 21.  The title track, "Deliverance," is available now on iTunes and Apple Music.  The pre-order for the EP is also available now on iTunes, Google Play and Amazon. The EP disc version of DELIVERANCE will be released nationwide on June 2 at Walmart, Target and other major brick and mortar stores.   NEW UNDISCOVERED PRINCE RECORDINGS TO BE RELEASED THIS FRIDAY WITH “DELIVERANCE” EP DELIVERANCE features six previously unreleased tracks:  "Deliverance," "Man Opera," which includes a four-movement medley:  "I Am," "Touch Me," "Sunrise Sunset," "No One Else;" and an extended version of "I Am."  The songs were written and recorded when Prince was an independent artist, protesting what he saw as an unjust music industry.  In the spirit of that independence, and in supporting Prince's opinion of major label contracts, DELIVERANCE is being released independently via RMA, a Vancouver, WA based record company.  The majority of all sales of DELIVERANCE will benefit Prince's estate. Prince, and Ian Boxill (2Pac, Gladys Knight, Janet Jackson, Bone Thugs-n-Harmony, multiple award winning Prince albums), co-wrote and co-produced all of the tracks beginning in 2006. After Prince's untimely passing, Boxill continued their work by spending the past year completing the compositions and arrangements, finishing the production and mixing the songs. Says Boxill, "I believe 'Deliverance' is a timely release with everything going on in the world today, and in light of the one-year anniversary of his passing. I hope when people hear Prince singing these songs it will bring comfort to many."  He continues, "Prince once told me that he would go to bed every night thinking of ways to bypass major labels and get his music directly to the public.  When considering how to release this important work, we decided to go independent because that's what Prince would have wanted." Prince is regarded one as of the most prolific and groundbreaking artists in modern music history. A worldwide Multi-Platinum selling artist, Prince was also a multiple time GRAMMY® Award winner, American Music Award winner, Billboard Music Award winner, Academy Award winner, Golden Globe Award winner, BET Award winner, Soul Train Music Award winner, Brit Award winner, GRAMMY® Hall of Fame winner, MTV Music Award winner, NAACP Image Award winner, and ASCAP Award winner, and more.  About RMA: RMA (Rogue Music Alliance) is the brainchild of Gabriel Wilson and David Staley. As a production/marketing duo, Wilson and Staley have brought to market five Top 40 Billboard 200 Albums and several Billboard genre #1's (John Mark McMillan, Steffany Gretzinger, Lindy Conant, Bethel Music).  Exhausted by many years of witnessing the old "record deal" model and its share-cropping ethos, Staley and Wilson formed RMA bent on creating a business model which provides "Equity for Artists." RMA's vision is to provide label-like services in a model which doesn't acquire, lock up, and own the work of artists, forever keeping them from owning the rights to their creative property, but rather seeks to create literal partnerships with artists in the joint venture of their work. RMA is a model in which the record label never makes more money from the artist's work than the artist does.  RMA operates as a hub of label-esque services partnering with artists to form their own micro label, seeking to inspire other artists to step outside the status quo.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    In Washington D.C., one of the selling points of an ambitious border-tax plan rests on a key economic assumption: The dollar will appreciate enough to offset any increase in the cost of cheap, imported goods that so many Americans have come to rely on. It’s just Econ 101, backed by well-established macroeconomic theory. But on Wall Street, traders and strategists who make a living in the $5.1-trillion-a-day currency market say such notions are preposterous. Even if congressional Republicans can set aside their differences to pass the proposed border-adjusted tax -- a prospect that seems more remote with each passing day -- you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone in the market who believes it will result in the greenback strengthening 25 percent, as the plan suggests. Part of the reason has to do with what they see as a misinterpretation of the underlying theory when applied to the real world. But just as important is the fundamental failure of politicians to appreciate how unpredictable the vast, foreign-exchange market can be, especially when global economic drivers collide and trillions of dollars change hands every day. “The FX market is the most difficult thing to forecast, and to build an inter-generational tax reform based on the assumption of what the FX market will do is a laughable notion,” David Woo, the head of global rates and FX strategy at Bank of America, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. How the dollar responds is certain to have consequences that extend far beyond the currency market. If it fails to appreciate as Republicans expect, consumers and retailers that rely on imported goods (think Wal-Mart and Best Buy) will be hard hit and slow economic growth. Currency appreciation is also a key political defense in arguing the plan -- which taxes imports and exempts exports -- isn’t protectionist and doesn’t violate World Trade Organization rules, as a stronger dollar levels the playing field between foreign and domestic products. In fact, the dollar has given up most of its gains since the November election, which gave Donald Trump and the Republicans control of both the White House and Congress, partly as hopes for a quick passage of a comprehensive tax reform bill waned. For Woo, it all boils down to simple math. Daily trading of goods and services between the U.S. and the rest of the world averages about $14 billion. That amounts to 0.3 percent of the $4.4 trillion in dollars transacted in the global currency market each day. In short, little more than rounding error. Much of the ebb and flow in currencies are dictated by the vagaries of traders as they respond to changes in monetary policy, economic growth and political risk. At times, it can cause the dollar to veer away from levels that economists would consider rational using measures like purchasing power parity. To think that the dollar simply turns on trade policy would be naïve at best, Woo says. Strong Assumptions Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has voiced similar concerns. “There is more than trade that affects a country’s exchange rate,” Yellen said in congressional testimony in February. “A strong set of assumptions is needed to believe that markets would fully offset those changes” caused by the border-adjusted tax. To be fair, it’s not as if House Republican leaders are just making it up. The plan’s assumptions about the dollar -- that it will rise just enough to bring down after-tax import prices relative to locally produced goods -- are rooted in a macroeconomic principle popularized by John Maynard Keynes in the late 1930s known as the “national income identity.” In its simplest form, it describes how a country such as the U.S. that saves less than it invests must automatically run a trade deficit. With a proposed border tax of 20 percent, the U.S. currency would then have to appreciate 25 percent to restore the trade balance by increasing the purchasing power of the dollars used to buy imports, and reducing the competitiveness of American exports. Real World House Speaker Paul Ryan, a key proponent of the Republican border tax proposal, said in February that the dollar’s rise is “obvious and mathematical.” Spokeswoman AshLee Strong pointed to those remarks when asked to comment for this story. It’s all straightforward in theory, but in the real world, it’s anything but. According to JPMorgan Chase, adoption of a border tax could trigger tensions with trading partners or outright retaliation. What’s more, the appreciation that Republicans promise may be delivered in the form of inflation instead of a stronger dollar. That happens when retailers pass on the tax to consumers or when sellers of locally produced goods raise prices to take advantage of increased demand. So it’s really the inflation-adjusted dollar (often known as the real exchange rate) that adjusts rather than the nominal rate, which JPMorgan estimates may rise as little as 6 percent versus major trading partners. “The theory is only sound as it describes the real exchange rate, not the nominal exchange rate,” said Daniel Hui, a global FX strategist at JPMorgan. Known Unknown Of course, there’s no way to know for certain how currencies will respond to a border tax because no system in the world is quite like it. And economists from Alan Auerbach of the University of California at Berkeley, to those at the Peterson Institute for International Economics point to a provision in the tax proposal that allows U.S. manufacturers to deduct the wages they pay from their taxable income, which could lessen consumer-price pressures and instead may lead to a stronger dollar. “A wide range of respected economists believe that the dollar will appreciate substantially and quickly,” said Emily Schillinger, a spokeswoman for Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. “Additionally, our pro-growth tax reform plan will create jobs, grow our economy and ensure that Americans’ dollars go further.” To UBS Wealth Management’s Thomas Flury, a number of risks could ultimately weaken the dollar. If local manufacturers fail to grab market share from importers, economic output could slow and force the Fed to ease up on the pace of its interest-rate hikes. Americans may just end up spending less. The dollar depends on “how the Fed reacts,” said Flury, the global head of currency strategy at UBS’s Chief Investment Office. “At least in the beginning of the transition, you have to expect slower growth.” © Copyright 2017 Bloomberg News.

The 60-year-old Victoria native works 60 to 80 hours a week as a nutritionist at Twin Pines Nursing and Rehab Center, and did not have the time to file her taxes before Tuesday. She took off early to meet the IRS deadline. Tuesday was the deadline for Americans to file their federal tax returns. Many people waited until the last minute for different reasons, keeping tax preparers busy all day. Bryant used the free tax service for the first time Tuesday afternoon offered by the Crossroads Volunteer Income Tax Assistance administered by the Community Action Committee of Victoria. "I have been working a lot, a lot of hours, no days off," she said. "If you don't have the help, you can't take off. You have to take care of your residents. They come first. Income tax comes last. That's what I strive to do every day, is to take care of them." Early Tuesday, Bryant was worried she would not be able to file her taxes on time, until someone told her about the free tax service. She also went by Wal-Mart to see if she could file her taxes there, but the tax preparation company there was going to charge about $150. "I was like, 'Oh my God, where am I going to go?'" It took about 20 minutes for volunteer Walter Maxwell, 75, of Victoria, to complete Bryant's tax documents. She sat by him as he asked her questions to fill out the documents. "I appreciate their help, their time, effort that they do to help everybody, to help the community," she said. Volunteer Ron Schul, 72, of Victoria, said the volunteer-based service completed more than 430 tax returns as of Tuesday, and expected to complete between 450 and 500 by the end of the day. Last year, the service completed 375 returns, and the number has grown every year since it began five years ago. The waiting room was full Tuesday afternoon. "This helps low income and middle income people in the neighborhoods in the community," he said. "People that have the least amount of money are the ones that seem to have to pay the most. One of the things that is quite expensive is having preparers do their taxes." The tax returns are filed through an IRS-certified system, and all volunteers are also certified by the government agency, Schul said. Volunteers double-check each others' work to make sure no mistakes are made. The returns are sent directly to the IRS. "A lot of times, we can get money back for them that they normally wouldn't get if they were doing it themselves," he said. "We know a few little ins and outs that are available that they might not catch. We offer the same services that the paid preparers do. We get every dollar that we can get." To receive the free service, the gross income of a household must be less than $54,000, according to benefits.gov. People can also use the service if they are disabled, do not speak English well or are senior citizens. Gilbert Orosco, 63, of Victoria, filed for an income tax extension Tuesday with the service, making his new deadline Oct. 16. Orosco is filing for an extension because he owes taxes back to 2013, he said. He waited until Tuesday to file because he didn't have the finances before to. Orosco went to H&R Block to file his taxes, but the company wanted $300 to $400 to conduct the service, he said. He has used the free tax service before, and said the volunteers are always helpful and correct. He plans to use the free service again next year unless he opens his own auto body shop business. Bryant plans to file her taxes earlier next year but will use the same service with Community Action Committee of Victoria. "I like their consistency; I like the friendliness and the help," she said.

Idaho Business Health Nation World Elections Photos Business PetSmart to buy Chewy.com, and the price fetched may be eye-popping Tue., April 18, 2017, 4:59 p.m. By Nancy Dahlberg Miami Herald Twitter Facebook  Email  Reddit  SMS MIAMI – E-commerce is going to the dogs. Or vice versa. PetSmart, the nation’s largest pet-supplies retailer, has agreed to acquire Chewy.com, the market’s No. 1 online retailer. The combination of Phoenix-based PetSmart, with 1,500 stores nationwide, and Chewy, based outside Miami, will enhance both companies’ reach, the companies said Tuesday. The acquisition, which is subject to customary regulatory approvals, is expected to close by the end of PetSmart’s second fiscal quarter. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. However, tech media site Recode reported that the deal in place is valued at $3.35 billion, according to its sources. That would make the sale of Chewy the biggest e-commerce acquisition in history, even larger than Wal-Mart’s $3.3 billion deal for jet.com last year. “We are focused on improving our customers’ experience in-store and online as we continue to execute against our long-term strategic initiatives. Chewy’s high-touch customer e-commerce service model and culture centered around a love of pets is the ideal complement to PetSmart’s store footprint and diverse offerings,” said Michael Massey, PetSmart president and chief executive officer, in the announcement. Chewy, which had been rumored to be a candidate for going public, has seen explosive growth since it was founded by Ryan Cohen and Michael “Blake” Day in 2011. The privately held company registered $26 million in sales during its first full year in business and logged more than $900 million in sales in 2016, the company said. Although it is not yet profitable, Chewy was projected to increase revenues to nearly $2 billion this year – nearly a 7,600 percent growth spurt in just six years. Today it has about 5,000 employees nationwide. The company built its following – more than 2 million customers nationwide – on customer service. Among its many campaigns, it sends hand-painted pet portraits as thank you gifts to 700 randomly selected customers every week. “Since we started Chewy, we have been dedicated to understanding and satisfying the evolving needs of our customers to deliver the highest quality pet products and customer service,” said Cohen, Chewy’s CEO. “Combining our strong e-commerce expertise with PetSmart’s best-in-class infrastructure, footprint and breadth of offerings including services will help us wow our customers even more.” Chewy will operate as an independent subsidiary of PetSmart run by Cohen and will remain focused on its current business strategy, while PetSmart will continue to execute its strategic initiatives across the combined company, PetSmart said. According to 1010Data, Chewy.com holds 51 percent of the online pet food market, including 40.5 percent in direct sales and 10.2 percent in subscription sales. But Chewy had bigger aspirations. “If you look at where we are today in the business, we’re still scratching the surface in terms of the total addressable market. We want to be No. 1. We’re No. 1 online. We want to be the largest pet retailer in the world,” Cohen said in a Miami Herald story in February. Chewy had raised several rounds of capital – about $236 million in total – to support its growth. On Feb. 1, Wells Fargo Capital Finance had become the latest investor, announcing an agreement to lend $90 million over the next five years to Chewy.

The German-based Lidl supermarket is looking to build on land where the Pink Elephant is located on Mahoning Avenue near Walmart. It wants to open an almost 36,000 square foot store on that spot. Map of proposed grocery store and Austintown zoning The company has an option to buy the land, pending zone changes to two of three parcels which currently don’t allow for retail. The zone changes must be approved by the Mahoning County Planning Commission, along with the zoning commission and trustees of Austintown. To discuss it, the Mahoning County Planning Commission will be meeting next Tuesday at 1 p.m. Austintown zoning officials will meet on Thursday next week at 6 p.m. Lidl is said to be a competitor of Aldi’s. The Pink Elephant bar has been a fixture in Austintown since 1967. .

The bank had just two branches when it was acquired, one each in the Delaware County towns of Grove and Jay, just across the Arkansas border. Aided by the acquisition of Decatur State Bank in late 2014, Grand Savings now has seven Arkansas branches. It has Benton County offices in Bentonville, Rogers (2), Gentry, Decatur and Siloam Springs, and another in Fort Smith in Sebastian County. Reflecting the entry into one of the fastest-growing metros in the U.S., the bank’s assets have grown 75% to $377.1 million since the new ownership took over. Deposits have increased 83% to $334.5 million in the same four years. Net loans and leases held by the bank totaled $293.1 million as of Dec. 31. That’s up 74.6% since the end of 2013. Perhaps most impressive, however, is income growth of 331% delivered for the bank’s shareholders, which now numbers 36. Grand Savings had its most profitable year ever last year with net income of $6.9 million, compared to $1.6 million in 2013. All of those metrics have contributed to the bank’s growing reputation as a successful community bank. Grand Savings ranks No. 3 in the six-county market area with a 1.95% return on assets (ROA), the lender’s best annual performance since 2007. “We’re very pleased with the growth that has occurred,” said Tommy Coughlin, 36, promoted recently to president of the bank’s Rogers/Bentonville market, encompassing three locations. “The ROA has been there, all our ratios are in line, and that’s made this a lot of fun because we aren’t growing for the sake of growth. It’s healthy growth. A little of it has been through acquisition, but a lot of it is organic.” To better manage its emerging presence in Benton County, the bank announced an executive reshuffling in March. Tyler Steele, previously president of the Northwest Arkansas market, was promoted to vice chairman of the board of directors, led by his father, chairman Tony Steele, and bank CEO Guy Cable, a longtime Northwest Arkansas bank executive. In addition to Coughlin’s promotion, Carla Martinez was named market president of Western Benton County, expanding her previous role of overseeing the Gentry and Decatur locations to include Siloam Springs and Gravette, which is scheduled to open later this year. To go with the promotions, Grand Savings also named Natalie Bartholomew chief marketing officer and vice president. She is a Prairie Grove native and has more than 16 years of banking experience in the market, most recently with First National Bank of NWA. Coughlin, son of the late Tom Coughlin, who was a close friend of Sam Walton as a high-ranking executive with Wal-Mart Stores Inc., grew up in Bentonville, and other Grand Savings executives in the market also have deep and established roots in the region. That is important to the bank’s business model, Coughlin said, to have a community-minded bent and support the towns that support the bank. “We like to use our network to benefit our customers; that is an advantage,” he said. “In all of our various markets we have folks who are long-term community members and very involved in those communities. Using those relationships is one of the things we do very well. I think it’s been very well received, and it’s a differentiating factor for us.” ‘A LITTLE ABOUT A LOT’ Coughlin joined Grand Savings as a loan manager in November 2013, coinciding with the opening of the bank’s first Arkansas office on Arkansas Highway 72 at the western edge of Bentonville. He’d previously worked for both Arvest Bank and Regions Bank for a combined nine years. Growing up the son of Tom Coughlin – who worked for Walmart for 27 years and rose to the position of vice chairman – Coughlin was exposed early and often to the retail industry. “I grew up working in the stores and warehouses, and you learn through osmosis,” he said. Coughlin graduated from Bentonville High in 1999 and began college in San Diego before returning home. Not sure what he wanted to do, a conversation with a Bentonville banker got Coughlin started down the financial services path. David Short, who retired in 2012 as president and CEO of Arvest Benton County, gave Coughlin some advice he still remembers. “He said, ‘If you want an opportunity to learn a little about a lot, you ought to look into banking,” Coughlin recalled. “That was good, solid advice. And I took it, and it stuck. When I jumped into it, I thought it would springboard me into something else. It was a natural fit, and I’ve enjoyed every minute of it.” EXPANSION PLANS Tyler Steele said it will be a challenge for the bank to maintain the growth path of the past four years. “But that is our goal,” he said. Grand Savings opened two branches in the second half of 2016. A second location in Rogers opened in August at 4201 Pleasant Crossing Parkway, at the corner of Dixieland Road. In Fort Smith, Nick Remy is market president of the bank’s new location at 9117 U.S. 71 South. It started doing business in October. Expansion to new markets is on the horizon. The opening of a new location in Fairland, Okla., in Ottawa County is imminent, Steele said. Later this year, Grand Savings will apply to establish a branch in Gravette in a former Delta Trust branch at 111 S.E. Second Ave. The bank bought the building in March for $140,000. Only two other lenders have a presence in Gravette — Arvest Bank and Bank of Gravett. Coughlin said bolstering the bank’s presence in the western half of Benton County has been a focus. He said the bank has been well-received in the area following the Decatur State Bank acquisition, and that’s been a good foundation to make the move into the Gravette market. “We think that half of the county is going to blossom the next 10 years or so, and being over there and being in Gravette will be good,” he said. “We’ve got a lot of clients over there.” A long-term goal, Coughlin said, is to enter the Washington County market. “We would love to find the right spot there, eventually,” he said. “That would make a lot of sense for us because we have some business down there already. “We have a very active board of directors, and they are great about looking for ways that we can grow the right way.” Comments comments Previous post Chicken processors like Tyson Foods to benefit from reduced supplies and exports Next post U.S. Treasury will auction One Bank & Trust in hope of recovering TARP debt Talk Business & Politics by email Arkansas headlines delivered to you on demand Email address Statewide Newsletter Northeast Arkansas Newsletter Fort Smith Newsletter Northwest Arkansas Newsletter Submit Advertisement Search Talk Business & Politics Search for: Opinion Michael Tilley Riff Raff: Observations, corporate pieholes, and the ultimate halftime show Justin Allen Previewing Arkansas’ amendment debates ahead of the 2018 election Martha Londagin ‘The food’s the thing,’ but not everything Michael Tilley Riff Raff: Observations, germ wagons, and getting state-ified Scott Cashion What we’ve done in the name of national security Latest Popular Tyson Foods CEO looking to lead company through its scale 4 hours ago TB&P Daily: John Brummett on state executions past, present and future 5 hours ago Flurry of court filings continue ahead of second slate of executions; Innocence Project, ACLU on inmates’ case 5 hours ago Reps.

The manager asked for them to be trespassed. 9:57 p.m. At Walmart, officers responded to a report of a suspicious person in a black hoodie in the parking lot who was looking at cars.

Highway 13 officers responded to a report of a homeless woman who was drunk and upset and was staying with a man at the hotel. The man was also found to be drunk and belligerent but eventually calmed down. Officers discovered the woman had two warrants in her name and arrested her. When she was taken to the hospital for a jail screen, she “went ballistic” in the emergency room when the doctor arrived. She was spitting on the officers and two hospital staff and threatening a nurse with physical harm. Officers tried to get her back in the car and she began beating her head against the screen. Officers had to hobble her, put a “spit hood” on her and bring her back into the emergency room, where she was sedated and taken to the Moffat County Jail the next morning on five counts of second-degree assault of an officer, resisting arrest, criminal mischief and other charges.

It’s just Econ 101, backed by well-established macroeconomic theory. But on Wall Street, traders and strategists who make a living in the $5.1-trillion-a-day currency market say such notions are preposterous. Even if congressional Republicans can set aside their differences to pass the proposed border-adjusted tax -- a prospect that seems more remote with each passing day -- you’d be hard-pressed to find anyone in the market who believes it will result in the greenback strengthening 25 percent, as the plan suggests. Part of the reason has to do with what they see as a misinterpretation of the underlying theory when applied to the real world. But just as important is the fundamental failure of politicians to appreciate how unpredictable the vast, foreign-exchange market can be, especially when global economic drivers collide and trillions of dollars change hands every day. “The FX market is the most difficult thing to forecast, and to build an inter-generational tax reform based on the assumption of what the FX market will do is a laughable notion,” David Woo, the head of global rates and FX strategy at Bank of America, said in a Bloomberg TV interview. Read more: the border-adjusted tax explained -- a QuickTake Q&A How the dollar responds is certain to have consequences that extend far beyond the currency market. If it fails to appreciate as Republicans expect, consumers and retailers that rely on imported goods (think Wal-Mart and Best Buy) will be hard hit and slow economic growth. Currency appreciation is also a key political defense in arguing the plan -- which taxes imports and exempts exports -- isn’t protectionist and doesn’t violate World Trade Organization rules, as a stronger dollar levels the playing field between foreign and domestic products. In fact, the dollar has given up most of its gains since the November election, which gave Donald Trump and the Republicans control of both the White House and Congress, partly as hopes for a quick passage of a comprehensive tax reform bill waned. For Woo, it all boils down to simple math. Daily trading of goods and services between the U.S. and the rest of the world averages about $14 billion. That amounts to 0.3 percent of the $4.4 trillion in dollars transacted in the global currency market each day. In short, little more than rounding error. Much of the ebb and flow in currencies are dictated by the vagaries of traders as they respond to changes in monetary policy, economic growth and political risk. At times, it can cause the dollar to veer away from levels that economists would consider rational using measures like purchasing power parity. To think that the dollar simply turns on trade policy would be naïve at best, Woo says. Strong Assumptions Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has voiced similar concerns. “There is more than trade that affects a country’s exchange rate,” Yellen said in congressional testimony in February. “A strong set of assumptions is needed to believe that markets would fully offset those changes” caused by the border-adjusted tax. Major importers of goods to the U.S. To be fair, it’s not as if House Republican leaders are just making it up. The plan’s assumptions about the dollar -- that it will rise just enough to bring down after-tax import prices relative to locally produced goods -- are rooted in a macroeconomic principle popularized by John Maynard Keynes in the late 1930s known as the “national income identity.” In its simplest form, it describes how a country such as the U.S. that saves less than it invests must automatically run a trade deficit. With a proposed border tax of 20 percent, the U.S. currency would then have to appreciate 25 percent to restore the trade balance by increasing the purchasing power of the dollars used to buy imports, and reducing the competitiveness of American exports. Real World House Speaker Paul Ryan, a key proponent of the Republican border tax proposal, said in February that the dollar’s rise is “ obvious and mathematical.” Spokeswoman AshLee Strong pointed to those remarks when asked to comment for this story. It’s all straightforward in theory, but in the real world, it’s anything but. According to JPMorgan Chase, adoption of a border tax could trigger tensions with trading partners or outright retaliation. What’s more, the appreciation that Republicans promise may be delivered in the form of inflation instead of a stronger dollar. That happens when retailers pass on the tax to consumers or when sellers of locally produced goods raise prices to take advantage of increased demand. So it’s really the inflation-adjusted dollar (often known as the real exchange rate) that adjusts rather than the nominal rate, which JPMorgan estimates may rise as little as 6 percent versus major trading partners. “The theory is only sound as it describes the real exchange rate, not the nominal exchange rate,” said Daniel Hui, a global FX strategist at JPMorgan.

And economists from Alan Auerbach of the University of California at Berkeley, to those at the Peterson Institute for International Economics point to a provision in the tax proposal that allows U.S. manufacturers to deduct the wages they pay from their taxable income, which could lessen consumer-price pressures and instead may lead to a stronger dollar. “A wide range of respected economists believe that the dollar will appreciate substantially and quickly,” said Emily Schillinger, a spokeswoman for Kevin Brady, the Republican chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee. “Additionally, our pro-growth tax reform plan will create jobs, grow our economy and ensure that Americans’ dollars go further.” To UBS Wealth Management’s Thomas Flury, a number of risks could ultimately weaken the dollar. If local manufacturers fail to grab market share from importers, economic output could slow and force the Fed to ease up on the pace of its interest-rate hikes. Americans may just end up spending less. The dollar depends on “how the Fed reacts,” said Flury, the global head of currency strategy at UBS’s Chief Investment Office. “At least in the beginning of the transition, you have to expect slower growth.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Source: WDAM HATTIESBURG, MS (WDAM) - The Hattiesburg Police Department is asking for the public’s help in solving half a dozen credit card fraud cases in the Hub City. People have continued to fall victim to card skimmers, from ATMs to gas pumps, and their card numbers are being used in multiple credit card fraud cases. Card skimmers target anyone and everyone and perpetrators can use those card numbers anywhere they please. “Watch your pin numbers, be cautious of where your cards at and check your balances,” said Hattiesburg Police Lt. Jon Traxler. Watching your account balance and card information is a quick way to know when something’s compromised. Persons of interest have been reported using fraudulent credit card information at Walgreens, Best Buy, Wal-Mart, Dandy Dan’s, CVS, Home Depot, TJ Maxx and other various department stores around the Hub City in December 2016, and January 2017. “We just ask the public, if there is anything they see on any of these videos/(photos), please give us a call so that we can try to get these suspects and get them behind bars,” said Traxler. Solving some of these small cases of credit card fraud, can ultimately lead to other arrests and other cases. “Anytime you have a case, period…it leads to something else, that’s one of the things we want to remind the public,” said Traxler. “By us catching them it could be us stopping another type of crime, you know the money or whatever they were gaining from it could be used in other types of crimes.” When you are using your card, whether it be at a gas pump, ATM, or anywhere else, be extra cautious. “I just remind the public to just use caution, be aware of your surroundings, anybody, something that does not look normal, may not be normal, give us a call, let us check it out,” said Traxler. If you do realize your information has been stolen, or fraudulent charges on your account, address the issue immediately. “First thing to do is contact your bank, if you notice something suspicious on your account, contact your bank immediately, and then contact us,” said Traxler. “We will come to you or you can come here to the police department we’ll do a police report for you.” If you recognize any of the people listed in the photos, contact Hattiesburg police or Metro Crime Stoppers at 601-582-STOP.

(Reuters/Andrew Kelly) Share Written by Frédéric Filloux Editor, Monday Note April 18, 2017 Amazon’s CEO annual letter to his shareholders is a must-read. Customer focus, decision-making, or the importance of writing important things down… Here are my takeaways from Jeff’s latest. Whatever we think of its founder and CEO, Amazon remains a remarkable example of great management. Since its 1994 start, the company enjoyed steady growth, relentlessly conquering new markets and sectors, coupled to exceptional resilience shown when the company weathered two market crashes (2000 and 2008). In addition, Bezos has demonstrated a consistent ability to convince his board and shareholders to let expansion take precedence over profits and dividends. (No one can complain: a thousand dollars invested in Amazon’s 1997 IPO are now worth more than half a million, a 500-times multiple). This didn’t happen without damage. By some measures, Amazon isn’t an enviable place to work, and the pressure it applies to its suppliers rivals the iron fist of Walmart’s purchasing department. All things considered, Amazon’s level of corporate toxicity remains reasonable compared to Uber, as an example. Jeff Bezos is also able to project an ultra-long term vision with his space exploration project for which he personally invests about a billion dollars per year. Closer to our concerns, he has given a boost to a respected-but-doomed news institution—The Washington Post—thanks to a combined investment in both journalistic excellence and in technology, two areas left fallow by most publishers. That is why I thought Bezos’ written addresses to his shareholders are worth some exegesis. Let start with last week’s letter. (Emphasis mine, and while quotes are lifted from the original documents, some paragraphs have been rearranged for clarity and brevity.) Bezos starts his 2016 missive with a question asked by staffers at all-hands meetings: Jeff, what does Day 2 look like? (…) [Bezos reply:] Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1. Then he enumerates the three obsessions that make Amazon what it is today: True customer obsession There are many advantages to a customer-centric approach, but here’s the big one: customers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report being happy and business is great. Even when they don’t yet know it, customers want something better, and your desire to delight customers will drive you to invent on their behalf. (…) [Y]ou, the product or service owner, must understand the customer, have a vision, and love the offering. Then, beta testing and research can help you find your blind spots. A remarkable customer experience starts with heart, intuition, curiosity, play, guts, taste. You won’t find any of it in a survey. (…) Good inventors and designers deeply understand their customer. They spend tremendous energy developing that intuition. They study and understand many anecdotes rather than only the averages you’ll find on surveys. They live with the design. A few things here. Legacy media are plagued by a poor customer consideration. After several decades in this business, I see little or no improvement in that area. This is deeply rooted in the persistent superiority complex of large newsrooms—which sounds weird for a population so hardly hit by an economic downturn. In response to that decline, owners have turned to business people who, unfortunately, focused their energy on the short term. The journalistic profession’s failure to properly manage the business side has led to a backlash, to MBAs taking over. And, as it happens in ailing sectors than cannot pay much, you rarely get the best people. This shift also left by the wayside the notion of product creation and management. Such notion fell through the cracks left open by journalists convinced (until recently) that their “mission” had nothing to do with any form of customer-oriented marketing, and by spreadsheet jockeys who felt that Malthusianism was the only way—“doing more with less”—and cut everything to the bone and beyond. The product was the main casualty of this process. Hence the implicit first lesson from Jeff Bezos: put the product and those who will use it at the center of your operations. Hire, train, and transform the mentalities toward that goal. Media needs product people. They should be the stars of any company as much as great bylines. Next, stay ahead of customer demands: No customer ever asked Amazon to create the Prime membership program, but it sure turns out they wanted it, and I could give you many such examples. This tune is a variation of Steve Jobs who said once that no customer figured out they wanted the iPod. The inability to anticipate customers’ unexpressed desires is the collateral damage of the management failure stated above. Don’t expect to innovate with inflated egos in the newsroom and with accountants in the C-suite. About processes in large corporations: Resist proxies As companies get larger and more complex, there’s a tendency to manage to proxies. (…) A common example is process as proxy. Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you’re not watchful, the process can become the thing. This can happen very easily in large organizations. The process becomes the proxy for the result you want. You stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you’re doing the process right. Gulp. It’s not that rare to hear a junior leader defend a bad outcome with something like, “Well, we followed the process.” A more experienced leader will use it as an opportunity to investigate and improve the process. The process is not the thing. It’s always worth asking, do we own the process or does the process own us? On this, everyone will find tons of examples in their organization. Again, the reliance on proxies is a direct consequence of a poor distribution of responsibilities. In a previous job, I tried to foster the Directly Responsible Individual principle, borrowed from Steve Jobs’ doctrine of product development. I tried to apply it from the smallest project (a new feature in a mobile app) to larger endeavors involving multiple high-ranked managers. I succeed for the former and failed for the latter (after a certain age and above a certain level, people tend to flee the risks associated with responsibilities). On anticipation: Embrace external trends The outside world can push you into Day 2 if you won’t or can’t embrace powerful trends quickly. If you fight them, you’re probably fighting the future. Embrace them and you have a tailwind. … While reading this my thoughts wander to the people in the industry (managers, editors, owners) I saw fighting tooth and nail to preserve old models—losing years if not a decade—as opposed to those small groups that decided early on to turn the ship around and take the tailwind… Today’s trends expressed by Jeff Bezos are of a different nature: These big trends are not that hard to spot (they get talked and written about a lot), but they can be strangely hard for large organizations to embrace. We’re in the middle of an obvious one right now: machine learning and artificial intelligence. (…) But much of what we do with machine learning happens beneath the surface. Machine learning drives our algorithms for demand forecasting, product search ranking, product and deals recommendations, merchandising placements, fraud detection, translations, and much more. Though less visible, much of the impact of machine learning will be of this type — quietly but meaningfully improving core operations. On this one, the media industry—including, in large part, newcomers—has my sympathy more than my criticism. Embracing machine learning and AI will require huge investments which, I’m afraid, only large tech companies will be able to pony up. I’m not talking about having a couple of geeks in residence tinkering some convolutional neural network, I’m referring to the journey towards deployment of systems critical to the news industry, to name but a few: Real-time fact-checking based on large and complex datasets Individualization of content matching user profiles and habits Adjustment to users’ consumption modes (home, office, commute) Ability to predict which reader will drop her subscription or, to the contrary, which one is about to convert Sophisticated recommendation engines (great Amazon and Netflix successes, and media industry abysmal failure) Profile-based search engines and curation systems My guess is the future will be owned by the Facebooks and the Googles for the most part, and corporations like Cambridge Analytica for a lesser part. I’m referring to the East Coast consulting firm that played a crucial role in Donald Trump’s victory with its ability to fine-tune political messages thanks to about 5,000 data points for each US voter. By comparison, Facebook offers about one hundred data points (listed here) while most publishers only have few dozens on their own. Several people I talk to here at Stanford believe the next leap in political campaigning will be the ability to tailor one bespoke message to a single individual, and to do so in real time. Can the media industry integrate such decisive trends? Realistically, not many players will be able to catch the wave beyond superficial gestures. First, only a few insiders actually grasp the issue (sometimes, I feel I’m speaking Urdu when I venture to raise the subject with media execs…). Second, the manpower required to build such systems will remain scarce and therefore expensive for a while, unless the industry decides to organize itself around full-fledged cooperation. (It could be a great endeavor for trade organizations such as Digital Content Next, or INMA….) Lastly, Jeff Bezos on decision-making processes: High-velocity decision making Day 2 companies make high-quality decisions, but they make high-quality decisions slowly. To keep the energy and dynamism of Day 1, you have to somehow make high-quality, high-velocity decisions. Easy for start-ups and very challenging for large organizations. Speed matters in business — plus a high-velocity decision making environment is more fun too. We don’t know all the answers, but here are some thoughts. First, never use a one-size-fits-all decision-making process. Many decisions are reversible, two-way doors. Those decisions can use a light-weight process. For those, so what if you’re wrong? I wrote about this in more detail in last year’s letter. Here is the relevant excerpt from the 2015 letter: Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible—one-way doors—and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that—they are changeable, reversible—they’re two-way doors. If you’ve made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don’t have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgment individuals or small groups. As organizations get larger, there seems to be a tendency to use the heavy-weight Type 1 decision-making process on most decisions, including many Type 2 decisions. The end result of this is slowness, unthoughtful risk aversion, failure to experiment sufficiently, and consequently diminished invention. Media organizations often like to see every decision as Type 1. Again, aversion to risk and a propensity to single out failure are the main culprits. By comparison, most newcomers have built their model on agility and systems that reward risk. On this, Bezos adds in 2015: Most large organizations embrace the idea of invention, but are not willing to suffer the string of failed experiments necessary to get there. Outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom, and conventional wisdom is usually right. Given a ten percent chance of a 100 times payoff, you should take that bet every time. But you’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten. This whole decision-making process is core to the “Bezos way.” Here is a summary of two other principles: First, we usually want too much information to make up our mind on something: [M]ost decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you’re probably being slow. Second element: knowing how to disagree but support a proposal; Bezos calls it “disagree and commit.” To illustrate it, he uses a telling example: I disagree and commit all the time. We recently greenlit a particular Amazon Studios original. I told the team my view: debatable whether it would be interesting enough, complicated to produce, the business terms aren’t that good, and we have lots of other opportunities. They had a completely different opinion and wanted to go ahead. I wrote back right away with “I disagree and commit and hope it becomes the most watched thing we’ve ever made.” Consider how much slower this decision cycle would have been if the team had actually had to convince me rather than simply get my commitment. Bezos, who can’t be suspected of succumbing too easily to mellow compromise justifies his view by the core competencies of the Amazon Studios team: And given that this team has already brought home 11 Emmys, 6 Golden Globes, and 3 Oscars, I’m just glad they let me in the room at all! To recall his vision, and its remarkable consistency, in each letter to his shareholders, Jeff Bezos likes to attached his original 1997 letter. By all means, Amazon founder and CEO likes to show the importance of writing down key elements of strategic or components of a decision making process. He’s known to start meetings with his senior staff by requiring them to read in silence detailed single-spaced memos rather that enduring yet another slide presentation. Too many CEOs and execs tend to forget the important of genuine writing. This piece originally appeared at Monday Note. Learn how to write for Quartz Ideas. We welcome your comments at ideas@qz.com.

By Patrick Kulp2017-04-18 21:23:57 UTC Petsmart just snapped up pet supply site Chewy.com in what's reported to be the biggest e-commerce deal in history. The big box store paid around $3.35 billion for the online outlet, according to Recode's sources — slightly more than the $3.3 billion Walmart spent on Jet.com in another monster online shopping acquisition last year. The deal is also all the more notable for the fact that Petsmart itself was most recently valued at $8.7 billion when private equity investors bought it two years ago. The brick-and-mortar retailer is clearly betting big on the fast-growing site. Despite a relatively low profile, Chewy.com has become of the country's largest and fastest growing privately owned e-commerce companies since its inception in 2011. The site pulled in nearly $900 million in revenue last year and claims to be on track for $1.5 billion this year.  As of January, the site controlled 43 percent of the online pet market — not far behind Amazon's 48 percent, according to data cited by Forbes. Chewy CEO Ryan Cohen, who founded the Ft. Lauderdale, Florida company with inspiration from his poodle, will keep his post after the deal closes. Petsmart is among the country's biggest traditional pet chains with more than 1,500 stores. The sale comes as brick-and-mortar retailers increasingly struggle to adapt to changing consumer habits — namely a migration to online stores like Amazon. The chain's willingness to shell out a sum that amounts to more than a third of its own value suggests that it's ready to dive headlong into that future.

And it's welcome news – Royal Blue’s discontinuation triggered sales as high as five times its suggested price on Ebay, and sent many devotees into a spiral of grief. And we mean every last stage of the emotion. Think we’re exaggerating? Just take a look at the comments section of Maybelline's Great Lash page on their website where real women explain why its return is, in no uncertain terms, a big freakin' deal: Shock You May Also Like MakeupThe Sephora VIB Spring 2017 Sale Is Almost Here MakeupThe M.A.C. Next to Nothing Face Colour Is Like a Filter for Your Face "Why oh why…with all us women pleading for you to bring back the royal blue, what on earth would make you even hesitate! My son found someone who was selling one and purchased it for me at $35. !!!! And I was so happy that I was yelling & crying. I would gladly pay that again to get another one. It is the only mascara & eyeliner I have ever worn since i started wearing makeup over 40 years ago. I wore it every day. My husband fell in love with me wearing the royal blue. I still wear it to this day & have had people tell me i should model for Maybelline ! There are other blue mascaras' out there, but they are not the Maybelline quality. PLEASE...listen to your customers and bring back the ROYAL BLUE !" — Dottie Wolfe, Richmond, Virginia Denial "BEEN USING ROYAL BLUE FOR 31 YEARS. IT IS PART OF MY IDENTITY AND PART OF WHAT MAKES ME WHO I AM. NO OTHER BRAND OUT THERE CAN COMPARE. MY LIFE WOULD NEVER BE THE SAME WITH OUT IT. PLEASE DONT STOP SELLING THIS PRODUCT. FROM ALL THE ROYAL BLUES USERS" — Jmccannon2 Anger "No!!! Im 26 and have been using this color since i was 12! It was my first mascara and it was in fact the royal blue color! All other mascaras including MAC and sephora brands i have RETURNED . Youll see a drop in sales. Im a makeupartist and on strke." — BeautyNamedStar Bargaining "Have used this since HS - I'm 60 now. Best part was the compliments I received on my eyes. Most people did not notice it was "blue" at first, only that it made my eyes prettier. The next thing was the ease of removing it without leaving "color" on my skin under my eyes. I've tried all the colors of Great Lash including the Green version years ago. I had difficulty with all the other colors either leaving color residue under my eyes or, having my eyelashes come out due to trying to get the mascara off. I started noticing the shortage of the blue a few years ago and tried stock piling some, which I am now at the end of. Is there really no hope for even a seasonal offering of this color? Say at Easter and then those of us who love it could stock pile for a year???? Thank you," —Nessa, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Depression (and Anxiety) "How could you do this?? I have worn this for 16 yrs. It is a part of me. It makes me feel beautiful and special. It's the best part of my day, because I get so many compliments on it. And now it's been stripped from me. Other brands cannot compare." — Mich1984 "I'm 55yrs old and have used Maybelline's Royal Blue Mascara since I was in 7th grade of Junior High School. Then, without knowledge that it was being discontinued......I went shopping from store, to store, to store, to store and yet another store and was unable to find. I suffer from anxiety and it caused me to have a panic attack right in the store. I ended up walking out and leaving all my stuff in my cart and driving home as fast as I could!!!!! Please, Please, Please tell me where I can get some Maybelline's Royal Blue Mascara!!!" — Kare Bare, Sioux Falls, Dakota Acceptance "I loved the Royal Blue mascara! It looked perfect with my skin color, my hair color, and many of my outfits. I rated 1 star because sadly, the product no longer exists. Please consider making it again! I do use the Great Lash Black and like it very much, but Please Bring Back the Royal Blue!" — Kathy16, Olney, Maryland The takeaway: Camp out in Walmart's parking lot on April 30th.

On Tuesday, PetSmart—which was acquired a few years ago for $8.7 billion in a private equity backed leveraged buyout—said it agreed to buy Chewy.com to accelerate the company's efforts to sell pet products and services both in physical stores and online in North America. The deal is expected to close by the end of PetSmart's second fiscal quarter of 2017. While terms of the transaction weren't disclosed by the parties, Recode—citing multiple sources—put the acquisition price at $3.35 billion in cash and near the $3 billion Wal-Mart Stores (wmt) paid for e-commerce startup Jet.com last year. A source with knowledge of the deal told Fortune that price was "inaccurate." Regardless of the price, the acquisition is yet further proof that brick-and-mortar retailers want to get serious about how to compete in a world where more consumer spending is gravitating to online sources. That pivot in spending has resulted in retail bankruptcies at a pace that hasn't been seen since the financial crisis and hundreds of store closures. The surviving chains are quickly realizing that a compelling e-commerce strategy is needed to better compete. And while many brick-and-mortar chains have bulked up on their own internally developed operations, e-commerce startups like Chewy.com have in many ways been more savvy and have successfully stolen market share. Chewy.com was only founded in 2011 but it already grew to generate over $880 million in sales in 2016 and the company was projecting to achieve over $1.5 billion this year. "Retailer and e-commerce is all about execution. The barriers to entry are pretty low," Chewy CEO Ryan Cohen told Bloomberg in an interview last year. "We obsess over of customers and we know the products better than any other pet store." Cohen had said that his goal was to build Chewy.com into a $10 billion business, though now, he will have to aim for that target under PetSmart's watchful eye. Following the closing of the deal, PetSmart said Chewy.com will still be led by Cohen and will operate "largely" as an independent subsidiary. Chewy.com was often rumored to be a potential candidate for an initial public offering in 2017. The takeover eliminates that exit path, though other pet-focused companies have gone public in recent years, including Blue Buffalo Pet Products and Freshpet. PetSmart's main brick-and-mortar rival Petco also considered going public, but instead sold itself for around $4.6 billion in late 2015.

(Source: West Plains Police Dept. via Facebook) (Source: West Plains Police Dept. via Facebook) WEST PLAINS, MO (KAIT) - A police department in Missouri hopes the public can identify a couple of suspects in separate cases. The West Plains Police Department shared three videos on their Facebook page Tuesday. Two videos follow a woman that officers are trying to I.D. in a shoplifting investigation. One shows the woman being confronted inside a Walmart by another woman and an employee. The blonde suspect pushing a cart full of merchandise then runs off camera. Another video shows the suspect's white van as it pulls into the parking lot. In a separate case, police are seeking the identity of a female suspect with dark hair also seen walking out of a Walmart. Police did not state in the post why they are seeking the woman, only to say it's "part of an active investigation." If you can identify either of these suspects, contact the WPPD at 417-256-2244. case 17-000823 female exiting 17-000823 white van 17-000730 Copyright 2017 KAIT. All rights reserved.

The deal is a huge one by any standard — bigger than Walmart’s $3.3 billion deal for Jet.com last year — and especially for a retail company like PetSmart, which was itself valued at only $8.7 billion when private equity investors took it over in 2015. But Chewy.com has been one of the fastest-growing e-commerce sites on the planet, registering nearly $900 million in revenue last year, in what was only its fifth year in operation. The company had been a potential IPO candidate for this year or next, but was taken out by its brick-and-mortar competitor before that. It was not profitable last year. Chewy was founded in 2011 by Ryan Cohen and Michael Day, and built a cult following for its excellent customer service, large selection and fast shipping. It had quietly raised at least $236 million in venture capital from investors including Volition Capital, T. Rowe Price and BlackRock. Its under-the-radar status was probably aided by the fact that it was headquartered in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and not in a big e-commerce market like New York, Los Angeles or Seattle. But it did have a big name in the industry as chairman: Mark Vadon, who also co-founded Blue Nile and Zulily. The deal seems like the type of bet-the-company acquisition by a traditional retailer that commerce-focused venture capitalists have been betting on for some time. While Walmart’s acquisition of Jet.com was a huge deal by e-commerce standards, it represented just a fraction of Walmart’s market value. Silicon Valley investors are surely hoping more will follow in PetSmart’s path, as brick-and-mortar retailers struggle to adapt to the impact of changing shopping behaviors. PetSmart had announced its intention to acquire Chewy on Tuesday morning, but didn’t disclose a price. PetSmart is owned by a group of private equity investors led by BC Partners.

Shrutika VermaSayan Chakraborty The merger is crucial for online grocery store BigBasket as it needs the money from SoftBank, even as Grofers is sitting pretty with $50-60 million of cash in bank. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint New Delhi/Bengaluru: Online grocer BigBasket, run by Supermarket Grocery Services Pvt. Ltd, and smaller rival Grofers India Pvt. Ltd have initiated talks for a merger that, if consummated, will also see SoftBank Group, an existing investor in the latter, participate in a $60-100 million funding round in the merged entity, said three people aware of the development. BigBasket needs the money. By far the best-funded online grocery store, it has held talks with investors such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Amazon.com Inc, Tencent Holdings Ltd, and Fosun International Ltd for a fresh round of funds. The talks haven’t progressed far, the people cited above said. Consequently BigBasket, which these people said incurs a cash burn of about $6 million per month, is keen on getting the deep-pocketed SoftBank on board as it rapidly runs out of cash. Grofers, meanwhile, is sitting pretty with about $50-60 million of cash in bank and a burn of about $2 million a month. ALSO READ: Paytm may raise up to $1.5 billion from SoftBank BigBasket spokesperson did not respond to emails seeking comment. SoftBank declined to comment. “The team at Grofers is focused on executing on our long-term strategy and we are well capitalized for that with an investor set that supports the vision. We don’t need to make any strategic moves at this time,” said Alibinder Dhindsa, founder and chief executive of Grofers. BigBasket has so far raised at least $220 million in funds from investors including Abraaj Group, Bessemer Venture Partners, Sands Capital and International Finance Corp. It last raised $150 million from a clutch of investors in March 2016 at a valuation of about $450-500 million. BigBasket is hoping for a valuation of at least $700-800 million, while Grofers could be valued at $150-200 million, one of the three persons cited above said. “The talks are in early stages, but there is definitely interest from both parties. If the deal happens, SoftBank will invest in the merged entity but a lot hinges on the valuation. The stakeholders are yet to agree on a valuation,” added this person. The Times of India newspaper reported in January that Grofers and BigBasket were exploring a merger. Grofers started out as a hyperlocal grocery delivery start-up in December 2013, picking up goods from neighbourhood grocers and delivering them to consumers, charging the merchants single-digit commission on the total order value as delivery fee. Over the past eight months, Grofers has been gradually moving away from the hyperlocal model. As the cost of delivery far exceeded the commission earned, the firm started shifting to the inventory model and launched high-margin private brands. It started selling staples and snacks under its private brands Freshbury and Best Value. Grofers has so far raised $165 million from Tiger Global Management and SoftBank, among others. During its last fundraise of $120 million in October 2015, Grofers was valued at $350-400 million. “Their business models overlap. BigBasket has always been an inventory led, private-label play while Grofers is trying to replicate it. The only upside for BigBasket in this deal is getting SoftBank as an investor,” said the first person. BigBasket owns brands such as Fresho, Royal, Tasties and HappyChef. BigBasket co-founder and chief executive Hari Menon said in an interview in December private labels would account for about 45% of the firm’s revenue by March. BigBasket aimed to clock revenue of Rs1,800-2,000 crore in 2016-17. As per research firm Tofler, BigBasket posted a loss of Rs278 crore on revenue of Rs580 crore in the year ended 31 March 2016, while Grofers posted a loss of Rs225 crore on revenue of Rs14.3 crore the same year.

Google Play now accepts PayPal for digital goods Google is killing its bold Hands Free payment experiment Video Samsung Galaxy S8+ Unboxing We’re used to hearing about new banks that have signed on to support Android Pay as Google ever-expands its mobile purchasing system. But an announcement this morning is looking to add even more value. Now you’ll be able to use Android Pay even if you don’t have a bank or credit card to add to your wallet. Google has announced a partnership with PayPal that allows you to use your account to buy things anywhere Android Pay is accepted. While PayPal users have long been able to access their accounts in the real world via PayPal Credit, the new Android Pay integration will open up mobile contactless payments to a wide array of people, allowing them to use the balances to pay for things at McDonalds or Wal-Mart. The partnership is a boon for Android Pay, which is competing against Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and other store-based services for dominance. As Google describes, “Millions of people already use their PayPal account to make online purchases, receive payments and send money to friends and family. Soon they can start using the same PayPal account to tap and pay with their phones in stores and speed through checkout in Android apps.” PayPal says that it processed over $100 billion in mobile payment volume last year and hopes the Android Pay partnership will expand its reach. The new service, which is coming soon, will be limited to PayPal balances at launch, and will expand to include credit cards stored in your account over the coming months. Why this matters: Contactless payments are clearly the future of checkouts, and Android Pay is right at the forefront of the movement. With the new PayPal integration, along with the new Android Wear 2.0 support, Android Pay is poised to continue leading the charge.

Huawei has just announced that the Watch 2 is now available in the United States for $299.99 in Carbon Black and Concrete Grey color options. The watch is available at Amazon, BestBuy.com, Newegg, and B&H Photo Video, and will also come to more than 800 Best Buy retail locations, as well as Jet, Target, and Walmart. Huawei notes that availability dates may vary depending on the retailer. As an added bonus, Huawei is also throwing in 10 weeks of free access to Google Play Music for a limited time. The Huawei Watch 2 certainly sports a sportier design compared to its predecessor, but you’re not completely out of luck if you’re looking for something classier. The Huawei Watch 2 Classic will also be available sometime “soon” for $369.99 in Titanium Grey. See also: Huawei Watch 2 review 4 weeks ago The Huawei Watch 2 certainly has a lot going for it. It has a great AMOLED display, two-day battery life, and a handy Watch Mode that allows you to utilize the watch even if you’re low on battery. However, the sporty design may not be for everyone, and it’s worth noting that the included strap is a little cheap feeling. If you’re looking for a solid Android Wear 2.0-powered device, though, this might be one worth checking out. Head to the links below to see the Watch 2 at your retailer of choice!

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Citgo Might Go Belly Up, and Russia Will Pick Up the Slack One of the top 10 oil refiners in the United States might be owned by Russian oil giant Rosneft soon. Motley Fool Staff Apr 18, 2017 at 12:16PM In this clip from Industry Focus: Energy, Motley Fool analysts Sean O'Reilly and Taylor Muckerman explain how Russia might end up taking over one of the biggest petroleum refiners in the United States. A full transcript follows the video. This video was recorded on April 13, 2017. Sean O'Reilly: Last night, Taylor, you sent me a really cool article about Russia, not about our government -- Taylor Muckerman: Yeah, not about government ties. O'Reilly: -- not about anything going on in the world. But, they're trying to take over my local gas station. What going on here? That's not cool. Muckerman: You might have heard of Citgo Petroleum, one of the top 10 petroleum refiners in the United States. O'Reilly: They're actually owned by Venezuela. Muckerman: Yes, they are owned by Venezuela. O'Reilly: Or, we should say, state run. Muckerman: What is it, PDVSA? The state-owned oil company down there. Unfortunately for them, they're not doing so well because of oil prices -- O'Reilly: Which were all connected by the circle of life, you'll remember that Venezuela was one of the countries begging OPEC to cut production, like, "We need higher oil prices, we're bleeding money!" Muckerman: So they're close to defaulting on some debt that Russia owns. And as a condition of that loan, they can take over PDVSA's stake in Citgo Petroleum. O'Reilly: This feels like Chapter 11, but on an international scale. I didn't know that was how it works. Muckerman: Rosneft, not Russia the country, but Rosneft, which has close ties to the government -- we're not going to get into that -- but they pledged a 49.9% stake in the company if they defaulted, as their collateral. So it's not a majority stake, but it's darn near close. O'Reilly: Plus, it's Putin. Muckerman: It's close enough. CEO Igor Sechin, has long been considered Putin's right-hand man. So, an interesting little tidbit. Still waters run deep in the oil industry. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

The Huawei Watch 2 is launching at Best Buy, both in stores and online, as well as at retailers like Amazon, Newegg, B&H Photo Video, Jet, Target, and Walmart. Pricing starts at $299.99 for the Sport model and goes up to $369.99 for the Classic version, the latter of which is coming soon. As a refresher, the Huawei Watch 2 runs Android Wear 2.0 on a round 1.2-inch 390x390 display. It’s got a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor, 768MB of RAM, 4GB of storage, and a 420mAh battery. The Huawei Watch 2 is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance.  Other features of the Huawei Watch 2 include GPS, a heart rate monitor, and NFC.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Android-Android+ Huawei-Huawei+ Wearables-Wearables+ Announced a couple of months back at MWC 2017, the Huawei Watch 2 is being released today in the US. The new smartwatch can be purchased in Best Buy stores, as well as online via BestBuy.com, Amazon, B&H, Newegg, Target, Walmart, and Jet. The device has a regular, plastic-made version priced at $299.99, and a more expensive Classic version that's made out of stainless steel and costs $369.99. The two models do not come in LTE variants - at least not for now. To celebrate the launch of the Watch 2 in the US, Huawei is offering buyers 10 weeks of free access to Google Play Music (for a limited time only). Thus, after purchasing the watch, you'll be able to stream music for free, and listen to it either via the built-in speaker (likely not an enthralling experience), or by pairing the watch with a Bluetooth headset. Running Android Wear 2.0, the Huawei Watch 2 can be paired with both Android, and iOS devices. The smartwatch offers a set of pretty nice features, including a 1.2-inch circular AMOLED display with 390 x 390 pixels, GPS, Wi-Fi, heart-rate monitor, NFC, Bluetooth 4.1, and a 420 mAh battery. As most other smartwatches currently on the market, the Huawei Watch 2 is dust- and water-resistant (IP68 certified).

First announced back at Mobile World Congress in late February, the watch brings a bulkier, more rugged design, an LTE-supported model, upgraded specs, support for Google’s Android Pay mobile payments platform, and more… Book a Free Smart Home Consultation w/ Amazon Services The watch is going on sale today at all the usual retailers, including at Best Buy brick-and-mortar retailers, as well as online at Best Buy, Amazon, Newegg, B&H Photo Video, Jet, Target and Walmart. Both the Concrete Grey and the Carbon Black color variants (which are both “Sport” models) are available on Amazon’s website now for $300, and the retailer is quoting shipping times within 1 to 2 months. Perhaps to help mitigate that high price tag, Huawei also announced today that Huawei Watch 2 purchases will ship with 10 free weeks of Google Play Music. If you want the “Classic” model — which ships with a leather strap and a more metal-like case — you’re currently out of luck. But Huawei says that model will be “available soon” and will start at a slight premium of $370 — only available in “Titanium Grey”. Both models are nearly identical, featuring a 1.2-inch display coming in at a resolution of 390 x 390. They both have Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor, 420mAh batteries, and 2GB of on-board storage. As for size, they both have 45mm watch casings, which comes in at 3mm larger than the original. On the software side, both watches of course ship with Android Wear 2.0 — the latest version of Google’s wearable OS. Stephen Hall @hallstephenj Stephen is Managing Editor at 9to5Google.

kotaku Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video The Bests Steamed Cosplay Compete Snacktaku Highlight Reel Podcast Review Snacking Near Your Keyboard: A Guide To What (Not) To Do Cecilia D'Anastasio and Mike FaheyYesterday 11:09am Filed to: snacks Keyboard mechanical keyboards hardware kotakucore 92 5 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink No keyboards were harmed in the shooting of this photo The other day, our intrepid snack and gaming hardware reporter Mike Fahey picked up KFC for lunch. He brought it home and returned to his office, where, at the most recent count, he keeps 11 mechanical keyboards. Collecting them is his new hobby. And he’s taking it very seriously. He refused to eat anything anywhere near his precious keyboard menagerie. He compared it to “storing newborn babies under the booths of Dennys.” Advertisement I, Cecilia, told him that’s not relatable. “99% of gamers are more likely to keep a box of Cheez-Its by their computers than a bag of moist towelettes,” I responded. As someone who once received a Geek Squad PC diagnostic report calling my keyboard “malodorous,” I am a firm believer in snacking while PC gaming. Sure, I have some regrets. But my desk would feel naked without at least one type of snack or drink on it. Anyway, what am I supposed to do between Overwatch matches? Fahey and I disagree about whether it is a cardinal sin to snack near your gaming rig. So we have some pretty, um, conflicting advice on how to do it. Our tips on snacking while PC gaming below: How To Spare Your Keyboard, Which Should Be Nowhere Near Your Snacks, by Mike Fahey This is a $150 keyboard with $180 key caps. It could use some melted chocolate. I am the Snacktaku guy, but I am also the Keytaku guy, and while those two guys don’t always see eye to eye, perhaps they can come together to teach Kotaku’s resident anime expert a thing or two about safe snacking. Don’t eat anywhere near your keyboard The easiest way to avoid gunking up your expensive mechanical keyboard with crumbs and drinks and various accumulations of questionable biomatter is to excuse yourself, get up from your chair and wander into another room. The living room is nice. Maybe step outside and have yourself a Hot Pocket. Oh, or the bathroom. I know some folks shy away from bathroom eating, but it always seemed so efficient to me, like opening Christmas presents at the trash dump. Maybe that’s a bad analogy. Another good option, don’t leave enough room for food. Eat near your desk, but not at your desk Fine, you are hungry, and you can’t step away from World of Warcraft long enough to eat in an area specifically designed for such things. You don’t have to be hunched over your keyboard, crumbling potato chips into your maw while exploring Dire Maw. Look to your left. Or maybe your right. If you have space on either side of you, put the food there. Maybe get a tray table from Walmart for $10 or something. Or just build a tower of snacks, turning away from your game now and again to sink your face into it. The key to clean keyboard eating is keeping the food away from the keyboard. Keep wipes handy. Air is all around us. Assign yourself a snacky cup You really can’t just turn to the side? Okay fine. Let’s minimize the damage then. It’s not really the eating over the keyboard that does most of the harm, but the oil and crumbs on your fingertips that do the most damage. Greasy fingers can rub the legends right off of cheaper keycaps, and those tiny crumbs you don’t see might not feel like much, but together in the nooks and crannies of your lovely mechanical marvel they can cause a real problem. So do this. Go into the kitchen, get a big plastic cup and fill it with chips. Or Cheetos. Or pizza rolls. Or cake frosting. Look, I don’t know what you eat at your keyboard. I just know that if it goes from cup to mouth, your fingers won’t hurt the keyboard that’s showing them so much love. Buy a cheap-ass keyboard for when you can’t help yourself Why do I own so many different mechanical keyboards? Part of it is a healthy obsession. Totally healthy. Such a great obsession you guys. But really, I want to experience all the mechanical keyboard market has to offer, from mass-produced boards with big names to do-it-yourself kits. I want to know the feel of all the switches, from Cherry MX to Topre to buckling spring. I have different keyboards for different moods. No reason I shouldn’t have one more for when I want to slobber KFC all over my desk. Advertisement Advertisement I can buy a keyboard for under $10 on Amazon and have it here by tomorrow. It probably won’t have fancy N-key rollover or dedicated gaming macro keys. The response times won’t be nearly as fast, but let’s face it, if you’re not focused on the game enough to forego eating until it’s done, then you probably don’t need to worry about the finer details. Just plug in your shit keyboard and dribble some of that Szechaun nugget sauce all over it, Morty. Seriously though, don’t eat near your keyboard. You want to eat and game? Go sit on the couch and clog up your Xbox One controller with chip grease. There’s nothing more exciting than picking up a preowned game controller and then spending a half hour digging brown and yellow stuff out of the seams with a paper clip. Much more entertaining than being curled up under your computer desk and crying while cradling a broken $200 keyboard. Wait a Minute. How To Snack While Also Playing Video Games And Feel Good About It, by Cecilia D’Anastasio I was legitimately shocked to learn that a lot of people—especially at Kotaku—are offended by the idea of snacking by a computer, which says a lot about the kind of people I hang with. Probably, the naysayers are picturing this: Or, at worst, this: Dear readers, it is nothing of the sort. Even I am disgusted a little by this extremely staged and unrealistic snacking experience. Sponsored I now understand that some people whisper little keyboard prayers each time the word “dinner” is evoked near a computer. You’re different from me and that’s okay. It’s possible that you spent a lot of money on your keyboard (or eleven keyboards) and its well-being makes you nervous. I will justify my controversial habits by noting that gaming is for fun. As a rule, it’s good to be a chill gamer. Snacks are fun, too, and enhance gaming experiences by keeping you fueled and happy. As long as you insert them directly into your mouth, you should be okay. I promise. You don’t need to be stressed out by your freetime activity. Eat a cookie. Drink a beer. Let me walk you through acceptable snacking while PC gaming etiquette. Pick the right snacks The best strategy is buying snacks you can grab a quick handful of between matches. The snack must not leave residue. It must be structurally sound, dry and not very crumbly. Grease is unacceptable. Cheez-Its, pretzels, popcorn, grapes, coated candies (i.e. Skittles), select cookies, trail mix, jerky or dried fruit are all great options. Unless you’re a bad eater, they won’t crumb on your keyboard. Dropping one is not the end of the world. And, with your hands, there’s less risk of doing so. Advertisement For snack inspiration, go to a local LAN cafe. Their owners have a vested interest in maintaining their PCs while selling patrons snacks. One I frequent offers M&Ms, Cheez-Its, Swedish Fish, Hot Pockets and things along those lines. Shun the wrong snacks Food you eat with a utensils, like leftover Chinese, is risky. On the off chance it drops on your keyboard, you’re in trouble. Food with any sort of flavor dusting, like Cheetos or Doritos or flavored chips, are not a good idea. That stuff accumulates in between and under your keys—especially if your keyboard is mechanical. You would have to get up and wash your hands after each handful to pull that off, or keep hand wipes by your computer, which smell weird and might make your fingers slippery. Snack placement The worst thing about the above pictures is not actually my choice or quantity of snacks, but the location of the Cheez-It box. It is on top of my mouse. This, friends, is a PC snacking sin. If you are right-handed, this is where you put your snacks: Snacks must be accessible for quick bites but far enough away from your mouse that they will not compromise your gaming abilities. Also, pick one snack, not many. I accept your complaint that sweet and savory snacks are better when alternated, but place them far from your gaming appendages. The disaster situation is your mouse crashing into a bag of Doritos on its way to snipe an enemy. Keyboard maintenance The pictured keyboard at my desk is a Corsair mechanical keyboard. It is very nice. Also, it keeps my housemates awake. I live in New York and the walls are thin and I just cannot subject other humans who help me pay rent to my very bad Overwatch habits. I do not use that keyboard anymore. This is my normal setup: With the crappy keyboard, I’ll wipe it down every once in a while or, maybe, spray canned air into it upside-down. But let’s talk about the mechanical keyboard maintenance, because probably, that’s what you’re here for. Advertisement Advertisement Because mechanical keyboards are very expensive, it’s important to take good care of them. Snack build-up makes the key inputs slower. You know that. Also, it’s gross and could attract pests. Worst-case scenario: You turn your keyboard upside-down and a heavy storm of crumbs comes tumbling out. The issue is that you’re a messy eater. Not that you chose to eat there. So, to get rid of inevitable dust on top of the keyboard, use a small brush or a can of compressed air. To clean its guts, turn the keyboard over and use that compressed air again onto a table. If you have a small, handheld vacuum with a brush extension, you could run that along the top. Finish with a disinfectant wipe. Let it dry. I’m not going to tell you to take out all your keys, wash and dry them and put them back. I won’t tell you to kiss each input or sing them lullabies before bed. If that’s a fun thing for you, go ahead and do it. If it’s not, allow me to remind you that games are for fun. Readers, you’ve seen our advice. Choose wisely about which tips to follow. And let us know where you stand in this debate.

The Huawei Watch 2 starts at US$300 and is sold through big-name retailers like Best Buy, Target, Newegg, B&H Photo, Amazon and Walmart, though availability may vary by outlet. Huawei's latest wrist wearable has a more aggressive, sportier look than the first-generation model. It also rocks the latest Android Wear 2.0 operating system and many of the bells and whistles to support it: a heart rate sensor, NFC and built-in GPS amongst other specs and features. Sick of Ads?

Join them for just US$19 a year.More Information The US version, however, lacks the LTE cellular option that was included in the European model we reviewed. (And no versions of it have an Apple Watch-like Digital Crown equivalent, like we saw in the LG Watch Sport and Style.) In the US, only the carbon black and concrete grey color variants will be available. The third day-glow orange color option is only available in select international markets at this time. If you prefer a more traditional look, the Huawei Watch 2 Classic, which appears more formal and streamlined, should also be available soon with an MSRP of $370.

By Phil Hall - April 18, 2017 SHARE Facebook Twitter The tumult in the retail sector may become more dramatic with a report that a leading e-commerce site is allegedly evaluating the purchase of a Northeastern retail chain. According to a New York Post article that cited an unidentified source, Amazon was considering the possibility of buying BJ’s Wholesale Club, which operates 213 stores and 130 gas stations in 15 states – including three locations in Fairfield County, two in Westchester County and one in Rockland County. However, it is not certain whether Amazon is still interested in the transaction or if it will bid on a potential sale. BJ’s is owned by the private equity firms CVC Capital Partners and Leonard Green & Partners, who took the company private for $2.8 billion six years ago. A possible sale could attract between $4 billion and $4.5 billion, according to the unnamed source cited by the newspaper. One entity that will probably not be interested in buying BJ’s is Walmart, which made an unsuccessful bid in 2011. Instead, the Recode news site is reporting that Walmart is in talks to purchase the e-commerce men’s fashion retailer Bonobos. If this transaction is successful, this would continue Walmart’s recent buying spree of online retailers – since last summer, Walmart already acquired the general merchandise shopping site Jet.com, the women’s online retailer ModCloth, the outdoor gear seller MooseJaw and the online shoe site ShoeBuy.

Left to right: Carbon Black, Concrete Grey, and Titanium Grey There are two versions of the watch: Standard and Classic. The Standard (sportier) version will come in Carbon Black and Concrete Grey while the Classic variant will come in Titanium Grey. The Standard version starts at $300 and the Classic one will set you back $370. Oh yeah, one more thing. Huawei hasnt made any mention of LTE or 3G connectivity for the States launch, so it looks like were only getting Wi-Fi/Bluetooth models (at least for now). Theres also NFC to use with Android Pay. If youre still not sure about the Huawei Watch 2, you can check out our written review here. Otherwise, tell us: What do you think of the Huawei Watch 2?

An Uber driver was robbed at gunpoint at a Little Rock apartment complex while waiting for his passenger to return to the vehicle, authorities said. It happened about 1:45 a.m. at 801 S. Rodney Parham Road, according to a Little Rock Police Department report. The 43-year-old victim told investigators he dropped off a man who lives in the complex after picking him up at a west Little Rock Wal-Mart. The man went inside to put away his groceries but asked the Uber driver to stay put so he could get a ride elsewhere, the report said. While waiting in the lot, two men approached the vehicle. One of them pulled out a gun, pointed it at the driver and demanded he get out of his car, the report said. The victim got out and ran, police said, noting he returned later to find the car still there but his iPhone stolen from inside. Officers searched the surrounding area but didn't make an arrest. The robbers are described as black men who each weighed about 130 pounds. One stood about 5 foot 6 and the other was around 5-foot 10, police said. No injuries were reported.

Mariella Moon, @mariella_moon 18h ago in Wearables Comments 311 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Huawei Watch 2 Huawei Watch 2, the wearable we think Google should have used to launch Android Wear 2.0, is finally out in the US. Starting today, you can get the $300 standard variant with its mixed rubber strap in Carbon Black and Concrete Grey from the usual retailers, including Best Buy, Amazon, NewEgg and Walmart. There's a classic variant with a rubber-leather hybrid strap and a metallic casing in case you want something that looks more formal. However, that one's not yet available (it'll be out "soon," the company promises) and will set you back $370. If you do snap up one of the standard variants, you'll also get 10 free weeks of Google Play Music, which will come bundled with the device for a limited time. It's a clever freebie, considering the watch can directly connect to a pair of Bluetooth earphones. A Play Music subscription can get you accustomed to the idea of listening to music straight from your smartwatch instead of from your phone while jogging or commuting. You can even download songs on its 4GB onboard memory instead of streaming them if you frequent places with poor signal. It's not entirely clear if the freebie will still be available for the classic version when it comes out, though you can always sign up for the service's standard 30-day free trial if it doesn't.

These outlets include Best Buy, Amazon, Newegg, B&H Photo Video, Jet, Target and Walmart. However, do note that Huawei states retailer availability will differ. Currently, US buyers will only get the Carbon Black or Concrete Grey options. There is no orange model that was shown at MWC. As for the Huawei Watch Classic, it will go on sale later this year (“soon”), priced at $369.99. Another note, it has been announced that no 4G model is planned currently for the US. That means you won’t find the Huawei Watch in any carrier stores, at least for the foreseeable future. For details such as specs, you can view those here, or check out our newly published review. Buy: Amazon | Best Buy | Newegg | B&H PRESS RELEASE (click to expand) HUAWEI WATCH 2 Comes with Exclusive 10 Free Weeks of Google Play Music in the U.S. Go outdoors with the lightweight sports watch that powers your music and adventures. PLANO, TX – April 18, 2017 – The HUAWEI WATCH 2, Huawei’s second-generation smartwatch, hits the U.S. today. It is designed to be lightweight and comfortable with a sport-inspired design and innovative new updates. Building on Huawei’s history of beautifully-designed and powerful wearables, the HUAWEI WATCH 2 includes features perfect for active lifestyles. HUAWEI WATCH 2 will be available at BestBuy stores, and online at BestBuy, Amazon, Newegg, B&H Photo Video, Jet, Target and Walmart. “In a world where technology is woven into every part of our daily lives, consumers want a smartwatch that meets their connected needs without compromising style,” said Robin Zhu, president, Huawei Device USA. “What we’ve achieved with the HUAWEI WATCH 2 is a smart, cutting-edge wearable with advanced fitness and scientific health functions, online and offline music – perfect for active people enjoying life’s everyday adventures.” To help U.S. consumers enjoy the online and offline music features, for a limited time HUAWEI WATCH 2 will come with 10 weeks free access to Google Play™ Music, a music and podcast streaming service from Google. The Watch The HUAWEI WATCH 2 is the perfect health and exercise companion, featuring innovative design details. Its chronograph double-crown design is inspired by sports watches, and makes controls easy to access.  What makes it a premium smart fitness watch, though, are the features under the surface, including a highly-integrated antenna (GPS, Wi-Fi™ and Bluetooth®) for stronger connectivity. In addition, its ceramic bezel helps better dissipate heat and is lighter, scratch resistant and six-times harder than stainless steel. With a 45mm (1.8”) diameter and the ratio of a traditional wristwatch, plus a high-definition AMOLED display with a 390×390 pixel resolution, the HUAWEI WATCH 2 is available in two designs – standard and Classic. The standard version will come in Carbon Black, Concrete Grey and the Classic in Titanium Grey. The standard series comes with a mixed rubber strap with racecourse-pattern design and will appeal to sports or outdoor enthusiasts of all ages. With a metallic casing and a quality rubber-leather hybrid strap, the Classic series is suitable for all environments – from outdoors to the office. It has a standard 22mm (7/8”) wide strap, which comes in a range of styles to complement the array of customizable faces. Exercise and Fitness The HUAWEI WATCH 2 has advanced fitness solutions to make working out more effective. Featuring the most established mobile connection technology and a built-in GPS chip, the HUAWEI WATCH 2 offers a significantly improved experience when using apps. Built-in smart sensors collect comprehensive data on user activities – including distance, speed, steps, heart rate, heart rate range, calories, stride frequency, route and more – enabling the professional exercise guidance and fitness management functions to offer detailed analysis that can help to improve a users’ quality of life. For example, with scientific training schemes and heart rate data, the HUAWEI WATCH 2 can alert a user when to speed up or slow down. It is also a smart health management device, meaning it can remind users to reach their daily exercise targets. Daily activities and activity levels are measured using three key indicators: number of steps, duration of medium and high-intensity exercise, and stand-up times. In addition, the HUAWEI WATCH 2 supports continuous around-the-clock heart rate monitoring. It can display a heart rate curve and resting heart rate for up to six hours. Workout to your soundtrack HUAWEI WATCH 2 lets users add music to their workouts through music streaming apps such as Google Play™ Music. From streaming music via Wi-Fi™ or Bluetooth® to downloading songs and accessing playlists via offline storage, users have the freedom to listen to music during their workout without bringing their phone or needing an Internet connection. And for a limited time, users can take advantage of 10 weeks free trial of Google Play™ Music with purchase of HUAWEI WATCH 2, making it easy to enjoy music on the go – using the speaker built into the watch, or pairing with a Bluetooth® headset. Smart Experience Running on Android Wear 2.0, the HUAWEI WATCH 2 can support iPhone or iPad with iOS 8.2+, or any smartphones with Android 4.3+, with on-watch access to a vast library of compatible and independent productivity, fitness, networking, music, travel and gaming apps. This ensures the device seamlessly integrates into every aspect of users’ life. The HUAWEI WATCH 2’s 420 mAh optimized battery features greater and density and a longer life, lasts up to two days with regular use. When in training mode with both the heart rate sensor and GPS on, the device lasts up to 10 hours. It can also last up to three weeks in Huawei’s exclusive Watch Mode and keep counting steps and display time. Availability Available in Carbon Black and Concrete Grey, the HUAWEI WATCH 2 can now be purchased at an MSRP of $299.99. HUAWEI WATCH 2 Classic will be available soon with an MSRP of $369.99, available in Titanium Grey. It is available in more than 800 BestBuy stores and on BestBuy.com, as well as online through Amazon, Newegg, B&H Photo Video, Jet, Target and Walmart.

Carl Levin (D-Mich.), opinion contributor - 04/18/17 08:00 AM EDT 637   © Getty Images When my father-in-law died, he left $10,000 to the U.S. government in his will. When people asked why he was leaving money to the government, he said it was because he was grateful to live in America. He never resented or tried to avoid paying his taxes, and most Americans feel the same way. They’re willing to pay for their share of the cost to attend public school, drive on safe highways, support our military, protect our environment, and enjoy the other services that a good government offers to a civil society. Where that willingness breaks down — and where it desperately needs fixing — is when corporations and wealthy individuals use gimmicks and tax loopholes to dodge paying their fair share, or, in some cases, to pay no taxes at all. That is an affront to hard-working, average Americans who need Congress to level the playing field. In fact, when Americans were asked in 2014 how best to strengthen our economy, the number one response was “ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share.” That’s not happening now. Each year, corporations and wealthy taxpayers can employ an army of accountants, lawyers and bankers to do what working families and small businesses can’t afford to do: set up shell corporations, questionable trusts, and convoluted schemes in offshore tax havens that have little to no taxes and strict secrecy laws. In this way, profitable corporations can declare billions of earnings in tax havens even when they have no real business operations there. U.S. companies like Apple, Microsoft, Walmart, and Caterpillar stash tens of billions of dollars offshore that by rights should be taxed right here at home where the income was produced or created. American firms now hold an incredible $2.5 trillion overseas, according to a Citizens for Tax Justice report, and have so far avoided paying U.S. taxes totaling an estimated $765 billion. Wealthy individuals, too, can hide their income behind corporations formed or banked in secrecy jurisdictions. It’s not a coincidence that Delaware is home to more corporations than people. One building alone is the legal address of nearly 300,000 businesses, likely in part because Delaware is notorious for welcoming corporations with hidden owners, no questions asked. Many states do the same. And hidden ownership is a useful tool for tax dodging. This tax dodging by corporations and wealthy individuals denies American families and communities resources they desperately need. The water crisis in Flint, Michigan, is a tragic example of public services grown dangerous from lack of investment. All across America, pipes deliver toxic water, roads crumble, bridges sag. It’s a sham and a shame, and Congress can take steps now to stop it. Congress can start by immediately closing the unjustified tax loopholes whose only purpose is tax avoidance, in particular, those used by multinational corporations to transfer their earnings away from the United States — where they would and should be taxed — to the Cayman Islands, Ireland, Luxembourg, and other tax havens. Congress can also pass the bipartisan Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act that will require states to collect the true names of all corporation owners and disclose that information to law enforcement when needed. While it’s unclear whether Washington can achieve comprehensive tax reform, Congress can and should act immediately to close unjustified and costly tax loopholes, eliminate tax incentives to shift and keep corporate profits offshore, and cut off access to offshore tax havens to both corporations and wealthy individuals. The United States has provided the freedom and opportunity for multinational corporations and individuals to attain tremendous wealth. These beneficiaries of America’s success have a responsibility to pay their fair share of taxes on Tax Day and every day, rather than shift the burden onto middle class Americans. For the sake of all the honest, hardworking taxpayers in this great country, it’s time for Congress to act.

Schoen | @johnwschoen 21 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES show chapters Steve Ballmer: USAFacts like an annual report on government    19 Hours Ago | 02:15 While the U.S. government is not a for-profit enterprise, here's how it stacks up against the largest American corporations, by the numbers. While the federal work force has remained relatively flat for the past two decades, Uncle Sam employs more workers than any single U.S. company, including retail giants Wal-Mart, Kroger and Home Depot; and global fast food companies such as YUM Brands and McDonald's Thanks to its taxing power, the federal government takes in much more in revenue every year than any single company. The government's total take last year amounted to almost half as much as the top 100 biggest U.S. public companies combined. The government also has more assets than any single company — more than $7.7 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve. (That doesn't include the value of federal land.) Two of the largest public companies by assets — government mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac — used to be owned by the government. Most of the rest of the top 20 asset holders are banks and insurance companies. The government has issued, by far, the largest pile of debt among the biggest U.S. companies. In fact, with more than $17 trillion in debt, the U.S. Treasury has more debt outstanding than the top 100 companies combined. While its debt pile dwarfs the private sector, the federal government trails far behind in another key metric: executive compensation. The U.S. government has a larger payroll, and serves many more customers, its top executive makes just $400,000 a year, a fraction of the highest-paid CEOs of public companies.

How did our bosses gain power that the government itself doesn't hold? By Miya Tokumitsu April 18, 2017 Illustration by Marcel Ceuppens Work no longer works. “You need to acquire more skills,” we tell young job seekers whose résumés at 22 are already longer than their parents’ were at 32. “Work will give you meaning,” we encourage people to tell themselves, so that they put in 60 hours or more per week on the job, removing them from other sources of meaning, such as daydreaming or social life. “Work will give you satisfaction,” we insist, even though it requires abiding by employers’ rules, and the unwritten rules of the market, for most of our waking hours. At the very least, work is supposed to be a means to earning an income. But if it’s possible to work full time and still live in poverty, what’s the point? Even before the global financial crisis of 2008, it had become clear that if waged work is supposed to provide a measure of well-being and social structure, it has failed on its own terms. Real household wages in the United States have remained stagnant since the 1970s, even as the costs of university degrees and other credentials rise. Young people find an employment landscape defined by unpaid internships, temporary work, and low pay. The glut of degree-holding young workers has pushed many of them into the semi- or unskilled labor force, making prospects even narrower for non–degree holders. Entry-level wages for high school graduates have in fact fallen. According to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, these lost earnings will depress this generation’s wages for their entire working lives. Meanwhile, those at the very top—many of whom derive their wealth not from work, but from returns on capital—vacuum up an ever-greater share of prosperity. NO MORE WORK: WHY FULL EMPLOYMENT IS A BAD IDEA by James LivingstonThe University of North Carolina Press, 128pp., $24.00 Against this bleak landscape, a growing body of scholarship aims to overturn our culture’s deepest assumptions about how work confers wealth, meaning, and care throughout society. In Private Government: How Employers Rule Our Lives (and Why We Don’t Talk About It), Elizabeth Anderson, a professor of philosophy at the University of Michigan, explores how the discipline of work has itself become a form of tyranny, documenting the expansive power that firms now wield over their employees in everything from how they dress to what they tweet. James Livingston, a historian at Rutgers, goes one step further in No More Work: Why Full Employment Is a Bad Idea. Instead of insisting on jobs for all or proposing that we hold employers to higher standards, Livingston argues, we should just scrap work altogether. Livingston’s vision is the more radical of the two; his book is a wide-ranging polemic that frequently delivers the refrain “Fuck work.” But in original ways, both books make a powerful claim: that our lives today are ruled, above all, by work. We can try to convince ourselves that we are free, but as long as we must submit to the increasing authority of our employers and the labor market, we are not. We therefore fancy that we want to work, that work grounds our character, that markets encompass the possible. We are unable to imagine what a full life could be, much less to live one. Even more radically, both books highlight the dramatic and alarming changes that work has undergone over the past century—insisting that, in often unseen ways, the changing nature of work threatens the fundamental ideals of democracy: equality and freedom. Anderson’s most provocative argument is that large companies, the institutions that employ most workers, amount to a de facto form of government, exerting massive and intrusive power in our daily lives. Unlike the state, these private governments are able to wield power with little oversight, because the executives and boards of directors that rule them are accountable to no one but themselves. Although they exercise their power to varying degrees and through both direct and “soft” means, employers can dictate how we dress and style our hair, when we eat, when (and if) we may use the toilet, with whom we may partner and under what arrangements. Employers may subject our bodies to drug tests; monitor our speech both on and off the job; require us to answer questionnaires about our exercise habits, off-hours alcohol consumption, and childbearing intentions; and rifle through our belongings. If the state held such sweeping powers, Anderson argues, we would probably not consider ourselves free men and women. Employees, meanwhile, have few ways to fight back. Yes, they may leave the company, but doing so usually necessitates being unemployed or migrating to another company and working under similar rules. Workers may organize, but unions have been so decimated in recent years that their clout is greatly diminished. What’s more, employers are swift to fire anyone they suspect of speaking to their colleagues about organizing, and most workers lack the time and resources to mount a legal challenge to wrongful termination. It wasn’t supposed to be this way. As corporations have worked methodically to amass sweeping powers over their employees, they have held aloft the beguiling principle of individual freedom, claiming that only unregulated markets can guarantee personal liberty. Instead, operating under relatively few regulations themselves, these companies have succeeded at imposing all manner of regulation on their employees. That is to say, they use the language of individual liberty to claim that corporations require freedom to treat workers as they like. PRIVATE GOVERNMENT: HOW EMPLOYERS RULE OUR LIVES (AND WHY WE DON’T TALK ABOUT IT) by Elizabeth AndersonPrinceton University Press, 224pp., $27.95 Anderson sets out to discredit such arguments by tracing them back to their historical origins. The notion that personal freedom is rooted in free markets, for instance, originated with the Levellers in seventeenth-century England, when working conditions differed substantially from today’s. The Levellers believed that a market society was essential to liberate individuals from the remnants of feudal hierarchies; their vision of utopia was a world in which men could meet and interact on terms of equality and dignity. Their ideas echoed through the writing and politics of later figures like John Locke, Adam Smith, Thomas Paine, and Abraham Lincoln, all of whom believed that open markets could provide the essential infrastructure for individuals to shape their own destiny. An anti-statist streak runs through several of these thinkers, particularly the Levellers and Paine, who viewed markets as the bulwark against state oppression. Paine and Smith, however, would hardly qualify as hard-line contemporary libertarians. Smith believed that public education was essential to a fair market society, and Paine proposed a system of social insurance that included old-age pensions as well as survivor and disability benefits. Their hope was not for a world of win-or-die competition, but one in which open markets would allow individuals to make the fullest use of their talents, free from state monopolies and meddlesome bosses. For Anderson, the latter point is essential; the notion of lifelong employment under a boss was anathema to these earlier visions of personal freedom. Writing in the 1770s, Smith assumes that independent actors in his market society will be self-employed, and uses butchers and bakers as his exemplars; his “pin factory,” meant to illustrate division of labor, employs only ten people. These thinkers could not envision a world in which most workers spend most of their lives performing wage labor under a single employer. In an address before the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society in 1859, Lincoln stated, “The prudent, penniless beginner in the world labors for wages awhile, saves a surplus with which to buy tools or land for himself, then labors on his own account another while, and at length hires another new beginner to help him.” In other words, even well into the nineteenth century, defenders of an unregulated market society viewed wage labor as a temporary stage on the way to becoming a proprietor. Lincoln’s scenario does not reflect the way most people work today. Yet the “small business owner” endures as an American stock character, conjured by politicians to push through deregulatory measures that benefit large corporations. In reality, thanks to a lack of guaranteed, nationalized health care and threadbare welfare benefits, setting up a small business is simply too risky a venture for many Americans, who must rely on their employers for health insurance and income. These conditions render long-term employment more palatable than a precarious existence of freelance gigs, which further gives companies license to oppress their employees. The modern relationship between employer and employee began with the rise of large-scale companies in the nineteenth century. Although employment contracts date back to the Middle Ages, preindustrial arrangements bore little resemblance to the documents we know today. Like modern employees, journeymen and apprentices often served their employers for years, but masters performed the same or similar work in proximity to their subordinates. As a result, Anderson points out, working conditions—the speed required of workers and the hazards to which they might be exposed—were kept in check by what the masters were willing to tolerate for themselves. The Industrial Revolution brought radical changes, as companies grew ever larger and management structures more complex. “Employers no longer did the same kind of work as employees, if they worked at all,” Anderson observes. “Mental labor was separated from manual labor, which was radically deskilled.” Companies multiplied rapidly in size. Labor contracts now bonded workers to massive organizations in which discipline, briefs, and decrees flowed downward, but whose leaders were unreachable by ordinary workers. Today, fast food workers or bank tellers would be hard-pressed to petition their CEOs at McDonald’s or Wells Fargo in person. Despite this, we often speak of employment contracts as agreements between equals, as if we are living in Adam Smith’s eighteenth-century dream world. In a still-influential paper from 1937 titled “The Nature of the Firm,” the economist and Nobel laureate Ronald Coase established himself as an early observer and theorist of corporate concerns. He described the employment contract not as a document that handed the employer unaccountable powers, but as one that circumscribed those powers. In signing a contract, the employee “agrees to obey the directions of an entrepreneur within certain limits,” he emphasized. But such characterizations, as Anderson notes, do not reflect reality; most workers agree to employment without any negotiation or even communication about their employer’s power or its limits. The exceptions to this rule are few and notable: top professional athletes, celebrity entertainers, superstar academics, and the (increasingly small) groups of workers who are able to bargain collectively. Yet because employment contracts create the illusion that workers and companies have arrived at a mutually satisfying agreement, the increasingly onerous restrictions placed on modern employees are often presented as “best practices” and “industry standards,” framing all sorts of behaviors and outcomes as things that ought to be intrinsically desired by workers themselves. Who, after all, would not want to work on something in the “best” way? Beyond employment contracts, companies also rely on social pressure to foster obedience: If everyone in the office regularly stays until seven o’clock every night, who would risk departing at five, even if it’s technically allowed? Such social prods exist alongside more rigid behavioral codes that dictate everything from how visible an employee’s tattoo can be to when and how long workers can break for lunch. Many workers, in fact, have little sense of the legal scope of their employer’s power. Most would be shocked to discover that they could be fired for being too attractive, declining to attend a political rally favored by their employer, or finding out that their daughter was raped by a friend of the boss—all real-life examples cited by Anderson. Indeed, it is only after dismissal for such reasons that many workers learn of the sweeping breadth of at-will employment, the contractual norm that allows American employers to fire workers without warning and without cause, except for reasons explicitly deemed illegal. In reality, the employment landscape is even more dire than Anderson outlines. The rise of staffing or “temp” agencies, for example, undercuts the very idea of a direct relationship between worker and employer. In The Temp Economy: From Kelly Girls to Permatemps in Postwar America, sociologist Erin Hatton notes that millions of workers now labor under subcontracting arrangements, which give employers even greater latitude to abuse employees. For years, Walmart—America’s largest retailer—used a subcontracting firm to hire hundreds of cleaners, many from Eastern Europe, who worked for months on end without overtime pay or a single day off. After federal agents raided dozens of Walmarts and arrested the cleaners as illegal immigrants, company executives used the subcontracting agreement to shirk responsibility for their exploitation of the cleaners, claiming they had no knowledge of their immigration status or conditions. By any reasonable standard, much “temp” work is not even temporary. Employees sometimes work for years in a single workplace, even through promotions, without ever being granted official status as an employee. Similarly, “gig economy” platforms like Uber designate their workers as contractors rather than employees, a distinction that exempts the company from paying them minimum wage and overtime. Many “permatemps” and contractors perform the same work as employees, yet lack even the paltry protections and benefits awarded to full-time workers. A weak job market, paired with the increasing precarity of work, means that more and more workers are forced to make their living by stringing together freelance assignments or winning fixed-term contracts, subjecting those workers to even more rules and restrictions. On top of their actual jobs, contractors and temp workers must do the additional work of appearing affable and employable not just on the job, but during their ongoing efforts to secure their next gig. Constantly pitching, writing up applications, and personal branding on social media requires a level of self-censorship, lest a controversial tweet or compromising Facebook photo sink their job prospects. Forced to anticipate the wishes not of a specific employer, but of all potential future employers, many opt out of participating in social media or practicing politics in any visible capacity. Their public personas are shaped not by their own beliefs and desires, but by the demands of the labor market. For Livingston, it’s not just employers but work itself that is the problem. We toil because we must, but also because our culture has trained us to see work as the greatest enactment of our dignity and personal character. Livingston challenges us to turn away from such outmoded ideas, rooted in Protestant ideals. Like Anderson, he sweeps through centuries of labor theory with impressive efficiency, from Marx and Hegel to Freud and Lincoln, whose 1859 speech he also quotes. Livingston centers on these thinkers because they all found the connection between work and virtue troubling. Hegel believed that work causes individuals to defer their desires, nurturing a “slave morality.” Marx proposed that “real freedom came after work.” And Freud understood the Protestant work ethic as “the symptom of repression, perhaps even regression.” Nor is it practical, Livingston argues, to exalt work: There are simply not enough jobs to keep most adults employed at a living wage, given the rise of automation and increases in productivity. Besides, the relation between income and work is arbitrary. Cooking dinner for your family is unpaid work, while cooking dinner for strangers usually comes with a paycheck. There’s nothing inherently different in the labor involved—only in the compensation. Anderson argues that work impedes individual freedom; Livingston points out that it rarely pays enough. As technological advances continue to weaken the demand for human labor, wages will inevitably be driven down even further. Instead of idealizing work and making it the linchpin of social organization, Livingston suggests, why not just get rid of it? Livingston belongs to a cadre of thinkers, including Kathi Weeks, Nick Srnicek, and Alex Williams, who believe that we should strive for a “postwork” society in one form or another. Strands of this idea go back at least as far as Keynes’s 1930 essay on “Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren.” Not only would work be eliminated or vastly reduced by technology, Keynes predicted, but we would also be unburdened spiritually. Devotion to work was, he deemed, one of many “pseudo-moral principles” that “exalted some of the most distasteful of human qualities into the position of the highest virtues.” Since people in this new world would no longer have to earn a salary, they would, Livingston envisions, receive some kind of universal basic income. UBI is a slippery concept, adaptable to both the socialist left and libertarian right, but it essentially entails distributing a living wage to every member of society. In most conceptualizations, the income is indeed basic—no cases of Dom Pérignon—and would cover the essentials like rent and groceries. Individuals would then be free to choose whether and how much they want to work to supplement the UBI. Leftist proponents tend to advocate pairing UBI with a strong welfare state to provide nationalized health care, tuition-free education, and other services. Some libertarians view UBI as a way to pare down the welfare state, arguing that it’s better simply to give people money to buy food and health care directly, rather than forcing them to engage with food stamp and Medicaid bureaucracies. According to Livingston, we are finally on the verge of this postwork society because of automation. Robots are now advanced enough to take over complex jobs in areas like agriculture and mining, eliminating the need for humans to perform dangerous or tedious tasks. In practice, however, automation is a double-edged sword, with the capacity to oppress as well as unburden. Machines often accelerate the rate at which humans can work, taxing rather than liberating them. Conveyor belts eliminated the need for workers to pass unfinished products along to their colleagues—but as Charlie Chaplin and Lucille Ball so hilariously demonstrated, the belts also increased the pace at which those same workers needed to turn wrenches and wrap chocolates. In retail and customer service, a main function of automation has been not to eliminate work, but to eliminate waged work, transferring much of the labor onto consumers, who must now weigh and code their own vegetables at the supermarket, check out their own library books, and tag their own luggage at the airport. At the same time, it may be harder to automate some jobs that require a human touch, such as floristry or hairstyling. The same goes for the delicate work of caring for the young, sick, elderly, or otherwise vulnerable. In today’s economy, the demand for such labor is rising rapidly: “Nine of the twelve fastest-growing fields,” The New York Times reported earlier this year, “are different ways of saying ‘nurse.’” These jobs also happen to be low-paying, emotionally and physically grueling, dirty, hazardous, and shouldered largely by women and immigrants. Regardless of whether employment is virtuous or not, our immediate goal should perhaps be to distribute the burdens of caregiving, since such work is essential to the functioning of society and benefits us all. A truly work-free world is one that would entail a revolution from our present social organizations. We could no longer conceive of welfare as a last resort—as the “safety net” metaphor implies—but would be forced to treat it as an unremarkable and universal fact of life. This alone would require us to support a massive redistribution of wealth, and to reclaim our political institutions from the big-money interests that are allergic to such changes. Tall orders indeed—but as Srnicek and Williams remind us in their book, Inventing the Future: Postcapitalism and a World Without Work, neoliberals pulled off just such a revolution in the postwar years. Thanks to their efforts, free-market liberalism replaced Keynesianism as the political and economic common sense all around the world. Another possible solution to the current miseries of unemployment and worker exploitation is the one Livingston rejects in his title: full employment. For anti-work partisans, full employment takes us in the wrong direction, and UBI corrects the course. But the two are not mutually exclusive. In fact, rather than creating new jobs, full employment could require us to reduce our work hours drastically and spread them throughout the workforce—a scheme that could radically de-center waged work in our lives. A dual strategy of pursuing full employment while also demanding universal benefits—including health care, childcare, and affordable housing—would maximize workers’ bargaining power to ensure that they, and not just owners of capital, actually get to enjoy the bounty of labor-saving technology. Nevertheless, Livingston’s critiques of full employment are worth heeding. As with automation, it can all go wrong if we use the banner of full employment to create pointless roles—what David Graeber has termed “bullshit jobs,” in which workers sit in some soul-sucking basement office for eight hours a day—or harmful jobs, like building nuclear weapons. If we do not have a deliberate politics rooted in universal social justice, then full employment, a basic income, and automation will not liberate us from the degradations of work. Both Livingston and Anderson reveal how much of our own power we’ve already ceded in making waged work the conduit for our ideals of liberty and morality. The scale and coordination of the institutions we’re up against in the fight for our emancipation is, as Anderson demonstrates, staggering. Employers hold the means to our well-being, and they have the law on their side. Individual efforts to achieve a better “work-life balance” for ourselves and our families miss the wider issue we face as waged employees. Livingston demonstrates the scale at which we should be thinking: Our demands should be revolutionary, our imaginations wide.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 18 April 2017 by Military News Coalition of Top U.S. Companies to Host Texas’ Largest Opportunity Youth Hiring Fair on May 19 DALLAS–(BUSINESS WIRE)–With an estimated 109,000 young men and women not in school or the workforce – nearly 13 percent of youth – the Dallas metro area has one of the highest rates of youth disengagement in the nation1. In response, a national coalition of more than 50 leading U.S. companies known as the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative™ will come together on Friday, May 19, from 9 am to 4 pm at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center to host the Dallas Opportunity Fair – an unprecedented, day-long hiring event aimed at Opportunity Youth – 16- to 24-year-olds who are not in school or working. The event will feature recruiters and resources from top U.S. companies including Starbucks, FedEx, JCPenney, Pizza Hut, Chipotle, Delaware North, Republic Services, Domino’s, Sprinkles, Five Guys, Target, Hilton Worldwide, Teavana, HMSHost, T-Mobile, Ulta Beauty, Macy’s, Villa, Papa John’s, Walgreens and Walmart. Together, they are offering more than 1,700 guaranteed job interviews throughout the day for local positions, as well as the opportunity to connect with more than 30 job-readiness and social services, including resume writing, interview skills, and college and financial aid applications – making this the largest and most comprehensive opportunity youth hiring fair ever hosted in Texas. Based on past events in Chicago, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Seattle, the coalition expects to extend hundreds of immediate, on-the-spot job offers at the May 19 event. It will also look to sustain investment in Dallas over the next few years, partnering with local organizations to create ongoing impact. “FedEx is dedicated to helping young people gain the skills and career connections necessary to find available jobs on the path to starting their careers,” said Kim Dixon, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, FedEx Office. “We’re proud to be a founding member of the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative coalition of leading companies and look forward to connecting with young talent in the Dallas area.” “JCPenney is proud to be one of the founding members of the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative coalition and we are in awe of the tremendous progress the cause has achieved in just under two years. We are excited for the next Opportunity & Job Fair to be hosted in our hometown of Dallas, home to a dynamic and thriving retail community,” said Marvin Ellison, chairman and CEO of JCPenney. “A job in retail can be the start of an exciting career path with a variety of opportunities for anyone who is passionate about delivering great products and exceptional customer service. We look forward to continuing our support of the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative by engaging young job seekers to join the JCPenney stores team.” Launched in 2015, the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative™ reached its original goal of hiring and engaging 100,000 opportunity youth two years ahead of schedule. But with an estimated 4.9 million young Americans still left out of the U.S. economy2, the coalition has since expanded its commitment to a new goal of 1 million hires by 2020. Each of the companies and organizations involved share a commitment to helping youth connect with employers and develop basic job skills. The goal is to get these young men and women into the workforce and on to a long-term pathway to success. “Connecting America’s underserved youth to a pathway to employment has the potential to create an enormous ripple effect on our businesses, communities and the economy. And, we are excited to launch our next hiring fair in Dallas,” said Kevin Johnson, president and ceo of Starbucks Coffee Company. “Through a series of initiatives, including our work with the coalition, Starbucks has hired more than 40,000 Opportunity Youth. This has prompted us to expand our own goal to 100,000 hires by 2020. These young men and women are thriving in the Starbucks environment, demonstrating that opportunity youth can be an invaluable pipeline of talent for a company like ours, as we look to fill 68,000 new jobs in the U.S. in the next five years.” “Since joining the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative, Pizza Hut has successfully filled thousands of jobs including several manager-level positions,” said Artie Starrs, President, Pizza Hut, U.S. “We are like-minded in the coalition’s mission of empowering youth to reach their full potential. We look forward to engaging with the smart, talented and ambitious youth in the city in which we work and live.” In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, and around the country, youth unemployment still tops 12 percent3, disproportionately impacting young people from underserved low-income communities. The coalition will work alongside Dallas’ civic and community leaders including the City of Dallas, Workforce Solutions Greater Dallas, United Way of Metro Dallas, City Square and other key partners to build on existing opportunity youth hiring efforts and ensure the initiative is sustained in the long run. “Our young people are the future of Dallas, and every one of them deserves an opportunity to achieve their full potential,” said Mayor Mike Rawlings. “I’m grateful for the leaders of the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative and several Dallas-based companies and service providers that have stepped up. The May 19 Opportunity Fair will help launch a true employer-led, long-term effort to provide career and education pathways to thousands of opportunity youth in Dallas. I urge our local businesses to take part in this opportunity to strengthen our city, our local economy and the workforce of tomorrow by investing in our youth in the form of meaningful jobs and training opportunities.” “We believe it’s our collective responsibility to invest in getting these disconnected youth into the types of jobs that are required for them to lead rewarding, productive lives,” said Ashley Brundage, Senior Vice President, Community Impact, United Way of Metropolitan Dallas. “Their future is our priority. We applaud the leaders of 100,000 Opportunities Initiative for bringing global leaders together to make a deep, lasting impact in our future. This partnership furthers our purpose of putting knowledge and opportunity at the footstep of so many eager minds. We are excited to collaborate on May 19 to empower, engage, and equip our next generation.” “We welcome the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative to Dallas. The event gives corporations with a Dallas presence access to a goldmine of entry-level trainable talent,” said Laurie Bouillion Larrea, president at Workforce Solutions Greater Dallas. “The benefits of youth employment are staggering. Early employment translates to higher earning in adulthood and better financial inclusion. Dallas-area companies need this talent and our Dallas youth need paid apprenticeship opportunities. It’s a win-win for everyone.” Youth Can Register for Guaranteed Job Interviews at the Dallas Opportunity Fair Interested candidates are invited to register for free and schedule an interview ahead of time for the May 19 hiring event at www.100kOpportunities.org/Dallas. Youth will also have access to more than 30 vital employment, educational and social services, including one-on-one resume and interview coaching; opportunities for civic engagement like voter registration and national service; the chance to build an online candidate profile; and more. The event will also feature informative and inspirational performances and activities throughout the day.

About the 100,000 Opportunities Initiative™ The 100,000 Opportunities Initiative™ has the goal of creating the nation’s largest employer-led private sector coalition committed to creating pathways to employment for young people.

Skip to content People TV Watch Kim Kardashian DWTS Housewives Bachelor Nation TV Mama June's Explosive Reunion: 5 Things We Learned — Including How Sugar Bear Met Jennifer! By Natalie Stone•@natalie_j_stone Posted on April 14, 2017 at 10:15pm EDT Share Tweet Email It all got hashed out on Friday’s reunion of Mama June: From Not to Hot. On The Confrontation episode, slimmed-down Mama June Shannon, her daughters Alana “Honey Boo Boo” Thompson and Lauryn “Pumpkin Shannon, and Mike “Sugar Bear” Thompson and his new bride, Jennifer Lamb, each sat down with Judge Lynn Toler, who served as moderator, to discuss the hit series. Below are five things we learned from the heated special. 1. Mama June Now Walks Around the House Naked Since Her Weight Loss First sitting down with 11-year-old Honey Boo Boo and 17-year-old Pumpkin, Judge Toler asked the girls what changes they’ve witnessed in their mother since she underwent the physical transformation, which resulted in her dropping down to a size 4. “I’ve seen a lot of changes in her,” said Honey Boo Boo. “She like walks around the house naked and stuff.” Work that birthday suit, girl. WE tv RELATED VIDEO: Mama June Reveals Daughters Pumpkin & Alana ‘Honey Boo Boo’ Thompson Have Also Lost Weight 2. Pumpkin Wants to Lose 50 Pounds After watching their mother drop a drastic amount of weight, Honey Boo Boo and Pumpkin each want to get healthy as well. “I want to try and lose over 50 pounds before like we go to the beach,” Pumpkin admitted. “I’m about to start going to the gym. I have someone helping me out with meal plans and things like that.” Honey Boo Boo also revealed that she’s on the healthy track. “I actually enjoy going to the gym,” she said. “It’s actually like a little playground for me.” WE tv 3. Honey Boo Boo Wants Sugar Bear ‘to Be a More Involved Dad’ — But Only If There Are Changes Though Honey Boo Boo and her father, Sugar Bear, don’t see each other often, she does want him to be more involved in her life — but changes in his personal life would be necessary for that to come about. “He found Jennifer and he didn’t come and see me anymore,” Honey Boo Boo alleged. “He was just gone. He would text like maybe once every three weeks.” “It would’ve been good to have a good relationship from the beginning,” she said about having a closer relationship with her father. “I do want him to be a more involved dad, but I feel like if he changes just a little, it’s not enough.” “I would want him to stop being so angry all the time,” she continued. “I would like him to start being my father, actually.” As for what Mama June thinks about the father-daughter dynamic, she said she only wants them to have a relationship “if [Honey Boo Boo] chooses to.” WE tv 4. Jennifer Says She Met Sugar Bear at Walmart — and Didn’t Know He Was on a TV Show Before meeting Sugar Bear, Jennifer had no idea that Honey Boo Boo’s father was on a reality show. “I didn’t know. I knew Mike as Mike Thompson,” Jennifer said about her now-husband. “I knew nothing about a Sugar Bear.” “I was showing my daughter a picture of Mike and she says, ‘Mama, I know him.’ … My daughter got on Facebook, she typed in ‘Honey Boo Boo’s dad,’ ” Jennifer said as she pointed her finger to Sugar Bear. As to how they met, Jennifer admitted that “it started out as like a Walmart, ‘Hey, how are you?’ in line. It went from there to exchanging numbers and talking.” Though the now married couple did communicate while he was in a relationship with Mama June, they maintain that there was no cheating and only began talking “as friends, towards the end,” according to Jennifer. “It was nothing more than, ‘Hey, how are you?’ Actually, it was even ‘How are you and June doing?’ It was nothing that was ‘Hey, come spend the night at my house.’ So there was no cheating,’ ” Jennifer explained. Asked if she worries about Sugar Bear being unfaithful to her, Jennifer said she doesn’t: “I snoop. I will go to AT&T today and pull the messages off your phone and look at them. If there’s cheating on me, I will know before you get home.” Sugar Bear also chimed in, “People’s like got the wrong impression on me because, yes, I’ll admit it, I did cheat on June. I normally don’t cheat but when you got a phone in your hand and you’re talking to this woman here and that woman there, you’ll do it. I’ve changed from that and I love her, she loves me. Hopefully one day we’ll include Alana into it.” WE tv And what do Mama June and Pumpkin think of their relationship? Asked if she believes that Jennifer and Sugar Bear weren’t romantic when she was dating him, Mama June said, “hell no,” and added, “He can’t keep that thing in his pants for two seconds. I mean the only reason that he’s been faithful to her this long is because he’s not allowed to do anything without her up his ass. The moment that she gives him a minute just to breathe, he’s going to do it again.” Pumpkin had similar thoughts: “This is what I don’t understand. If he was talking to Jennifer while mama and him were together, what makes her think he ain’t going to cheat on her?” FROM COINAGE: 9 Healthy Kitchen Staples That Cost Less Than $1 Per Serving 5. Sugar Bear Doesn’t Think He Has an Anger Issue While discussing his relationship with his daughter, Sugar Bear told Judge Toler that he doesn’t believe that he has an issue with anger. “I keep hearing about everybody saying I got an anger issue,” Sugar Bear told her. “You can ask Jennifer and anybody that’s around, they don’t see it. I don’t get angry.” But later in the show, Jennifer did get to see Sugar Bear lose his temper and blow up when he got into a heated exchange with Pumpkin, which resulted in him ripping his shirt open. After witnessing him explode, Jennifer told Judge Toler: “This is the first time I’ve ever seen him act that way.” Show Full Article Sponsored Stories More People Logo Celebrity Riverdale's Shannon Purser Comes Out as Bisexual: 'It's Something I'm Still Processing' Bodies WATCH: Ugly Betty Stars Vanessa Williams and Michael Urie Wish America Ferrera a Happy Birthday: 'You're Old!'

M.L. Schultze / WKSU Listen Listening... / Originally published on April 17, 2017 10:31 pm It's easy enough for people who live in cities to hail a ride, either from a taxi or a service like Uber or Lyft. There's plenty of demand, and plenty of drivers. A startup is trying to bring a similar service to rural America, but it has required some creative thinking. The town of Van Wert sits on the western edge of Ohio. It's a stretch of flat farm country punctuated with grain silos and a stone castle that's listed as the nation's first county public library. It doesn't seem like the first place a ride-hailing service would likely come. But Erica Petrie says maybe that's a mistake. Petrie is the mobility manager of the seven-county Area Agency on Aging. Her job is to find transportation options in Van Wert, which has no buses, one cab and a lot of needs. "The quick turnaround needs: 'Can someone help me get to the doctor?' We see short-term needs: 'Normally I'm able to drive, but my car's in the shop,' " she says. So Petrie helped recruit Liberty Mobility Now to Van Wert. The startup began in Nebraska about two years ago and has expanded to Texas and Ohio. It's also on its way to Colorado. Founder Valerie Lefler grew up on a dairy farm and worked on rural transportation issues at the University of Nebraska. She created Liberty as a business, but she talks about it as a mission — one requiring drivers to do more than leave customers at the door. "We really look for folks who are altruistic, that would want to do this anyway because that's what they would do for their best friend or their own mother," Lefler says. One of those people is Shelia Mendoza, whose mission in life, she says, is to be a grandma. Mendoza has worked for a dry cleaner and at a Wal-Mart. She's sold insurance, made RV cabinets and briefly ran Shelia's Cornucopia Cove. And when Liberty came to Van Wert two months ago, she was one of about a dozen drivers recruited and trained. The grandmother of 17 and self-described talker was a natural. That's because while part of Liberty's model is built on an app designed to work in rural geographies, much more of it is built on relationships. For example, Mendoza developed a relationship with her first customer who'd lost his license but found a job: the midnight shift at a meat processing plant. A county agency was willing to cover transportation costs for a few weeks until he could get his license back. "I always had him there five to 10 minutes early," Mendoza says. "We would stop and get coffee sometimes ... before he would go to work. Once in a while he paid for mine." Since he regained his license, things have slowed down for Mendoza. "I was happy he got his car, I was happy he got his license. He's a better person for that because I know he hated getting hauled around by an old lady," she says and laughs. She's hoping business will pick up, and her hopes rest with a lower-tech option Liberty is launching: a call center for those who don't or can't use an app. "I've heard a lot of people say, 'Well, I don't want nothing like that on my phone; I don't have room,' " she says. Scott Bogren of the Community Transportation Association of America, which specializes in smaller and rural transportation issues, says the call center shows that Liberty understands its target community. "The adult children of these seniors who can book rides for mom — they're going to use an online service," he says. "And combine that with the ability for mom to call in and talk to somebody that she can get to know — there's the sweet spot." Because of chronic transportation needs, Liberty is partnering with United Ways, hospitals, health departments and other social service agencies. Rides cost $1.25 to book and $1 per mile. The fees are a small fraction of what the cabby charges, but Liberty says it will also make referrals if the taxi's a better fit. Petrie says all of that captures the spirit of the area. "I like that the drivers are from the communities," she says. "People are I think more polite, more neighborly. That's just what is going to fit here." Liberty Mobility is hoping to find similar fits all across America. M.L. Schultze is a reporter with NPR member station WKSU. You can follow her @MLSchultze. Copyright 2017 WKSU-FM.

M L SCHULTZE, BYLINE: The town of Van Wert sits on the western edge of Ohio, a stretch of flat farm country punctuated with grain silos and a stone castle that's listed as the nation's first county public library. Fewer than 11,000 people live here, so it's not the first place a ride sharing service would likely come. But Erica Petrie says maybe that's a mistake.

House Bill 6200 was co-sponsored by 13 state senators and representatives, including Democratic Senate President Pro Tempore Martin Looney, D-New Haven. The bill would allow law enforcement officers to request permits from individuals who openly carry their firearms as long as the weapons are visible to the officers. Looney said in last month’s public hearing that the bill does not violate a citizen’s right to bear arms because the Second Amendment has long been interpreted to allow certain common sense regulations, such as this bill. He added that the substance of this bill is similar to asking all drivers to carry their driver’s license when operating automobiles. “It would seem even more justifiable to require presentation of a permit to carry since an openly visible pistol or revolver may cause anxiety to other persons within sight of the weapon,” Looney said at the hearing. “The visible weapon can be used as an intimidation factor even when the person carrying possesses permits.” Gun safety advocacy groups such as Connecticut Against Gun Violence also supported the bill. According to CAGV Executive Director Ron Pinciaro, his organization supported the bill because it received calls in the past years from concerned citizens across the state. Many of these residents contacted CAGV after seeing firearms carried in public spaces they frequent, such as Walmart and Subway, Pinciaro said. He added that many residents said they were scared and unaware of the open-carry policies in the state. In addition to alarmed residents, Pinciaro added that several police chiefs also reached out CAGV for help because officers cannot control situations if they cannot request to see gun permits. H.B. 6200 is an update to another bill supported by CAGV that passed in the state’s Public Safety Committee last year. That 2016 bill, which allowed law enforcement officers to request civilian’s gun permits even if the firearm is not visible, did not receive a floor vote in the House of Representatives because debate time on the floor was dominated by the group’s domestic violence bill, Pinciaro said. Both the 2016 and 2017 iterations of the bill incited concerns regarding the potential for police officers to stop gun-owners of underrepresented races. Both pro-gun right groups and state legislators from urban areas with a large African-American or Hispanic population opposed the legislation. State Rep. Robyn Porter, D-New Haven, said during the public hearing for H.B. 6200 last month that there are clear differences between how jurisdictions carry out police operations, and that a situation that might not alarm one city might cause alert in another. Porter also questioned the bill’s intrusiveness into a citizen’s right to carry weapons, even if the firearm is not involved in any suspicious activity — a real concern for the district that she represents. She added that the bill gives police officers carte blanche because it asks no further reason to stop gun owners than the sight of their weapons. The Connecticut Citizens Defense League, a pro-gun rights advocacy group, opposes the bill for a different reason, according its president Scott Wilson — namely because the bill is danger to the liberty of around 250,000 gun owners in the state. “The bill essentially would have stripped the terms under reasonable and articulable suspicion of a crime in progress or about to be committed from the statutory language in the Connecticut general statutes,” Wilson said. “No one who is not under suspicion a crime should not be stopped or detained for any reasons.” Calling the bill “a nuisance,” Wilson said he thinks that anti-gun groups wanted a token legislation that they can show as an example of what they were able to accomplish this year. He added that his group supports law enforcement officers and believes that they should be able to do their job. On the other hand, Wilson said citizens have rights for a reason and law enforcement also has restraints on their reason as well. The Connecticut General Statutes require all gun owners obtain permits to carry firearms, but does not specify whether the weapon should be concealed. <a href="//oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=62c8292d86&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536875016&cs=62c8292d86&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> <a href="//oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=e5cdecd82c&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536871928&cs=e5cdecd82c&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> <a href="//oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/rc?cs=86ee9b8042&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" ><img src="//oncampusweb-d.openx.net/w/1.0/ai?auid=536874945&cs=86ee9b8042&cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" border="0" alt=""></a> About Us About The Site Join Us Advertise Submissions Subscribe Legal © Yale Daily News 2017

The Dayton Daily News (http://bit.ly/2ppMDy0 ) reports the cost to the Dayton suburb of Beavercreek includes about $210,000 paid to two law firms. The city's law director says outside counsel was necessary. Crawford family attorney Michael Wright says the money could have gone toward a settlement for the family. An officer fatally shot John Crawford III in 2014 after a 911 call about someone waving a rifle at the Wal-Mart. Police say he didn't obey commands to drop what later turned out to be an air rifle. A federal probe for any possible civil rights violations is continuing. Information from: Dayton Daily News, http://www.daytondailynews.com Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The Prince George Crime Stoppers Community Shred It event is back and on April 29, organizers are eager to shred your waste while helping prevent identity theft at the same time. "This is our fourth time doing this. We hold one in the spring and one in the fall and the response just keeps growing," president of Prince George Crime Stoppers, Ron Polillo said. In partnership with Shred-it Mobile Shredding Services and Walmart, Prince George Crime Stoppers will be providing an opportunity for the community to responsibly, safely and quickly shred personal or important documents. "This is a great service where people who don't have enough paper for Shred-it Mobile can still get rid of what they have instantaneously," Polillo said. "It's a way to prevent identity theft in a safe and secure way while helping support Crime Stoppers." Crime Stoppers is a non profit program that is completely independent of law enforcement. The goal is to empower all community members to fight back and report crimes anonymously.

The cash infusion comes as House Democrats face pressure to break from their party and support Trump administration initiatives that could benefit the lobbyists’ clients. A filing last week by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) shows four corporate lobbyists raised more than $380,000 for the organization -- the primary campaign arm for Democratic House candidates -- between January and March. The three-month figure is nearly four times as much as the amount lobbyists raised for the DCCC during the entire 2016 election cycle. In all, the DCCC reported raising $31 million in the first quarter of 2017. Since the election, the question of whether Democrats should embrace or spurn business interests has been a point of contention in the lingering feud between the party’s centrist officials, most of whom backed Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, and supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who challenged the former secretary of state for the Democratic nomination. Last year, the Democratic National Committee ended its ban on lobbyist donations, which was put in place by former President Barack Obama. The decision angered many Sanders voters, who saw it as a move to boost Clinton’s fundraising in the primary race. In the wake of Clinton’s loss to Trump, progressives have pushed the party once again to reject lobbyist cash. Although the DCCC never prohibited lobbyist donations, the committee reported only about $100,000 in funds bundled by lobbyists in all of 2015 and 2016, according to a MapLight review of campaign finance records. Three of the lobbyists who have been collecting checks for the DCCC were major Clinton donors and fundraisers -- accounting for about $1.7 million in donations to the Clinton campaign and its joint fundraising account with the DNC and state parties. Some of their clients could have interests in legislative measures before the House of Representatives. Tony Podesta, who founded the Podesta Group lobbying firm, has raised $131,000 for the DCCC and donated $5,000 to the committee so far this year. His client list includes Walmart, Wells Fargo, as well as defense contractors Lockheed Martin and BAE Systems. Trump and House Republicans have promised to repeal the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform legislation passed after the 2008 financial crisis -- and House Democratic votes could be crucial to any repeal effort. Lobbying disclosures show Podesta’s firm has lobbied for Wells Fargo on “financial services regulation. The Podesta Group also lobbied on Dodd-Frank for the BMO Financial Corporation and the Investment Company Institute, a trade association representing the mutual fund industry. Trump is expected to seek Democratic House votes for measures to lower the corporate tax rate. Federal records show that in 2016, Podesta lobbied for Credit Suisse Securities, Oracle and Wal-Mart on the issue of “corporate tax reform.” Democrats have called for an investigation into the Trump administration’s links to Russia’s government. Podesta was hired to lobby for Sberbank, a Russian state-owned bank, during the 2016 election. He has also registered to lobby for at least six foreign governments, including Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Podesta bundled $450,000 for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in 2016. His brother, John, was a former White House chief of staff for President Bill Clinton and chairman of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Steve Elmendorf, who has raised $55,000 for the DCCC, leads the lobbying and public relations firm Subject Matter. His firm has lobbied on Dodd-Frank implementation for clients that include Goldman Sachs, MetLife and at least three financial industry trade associations. One of Elmendorf’s clients, CIT Group, recently gave Steven Mnuchin an $11 million payout upon his being appointed Treasury Secretary by Trump. Elmendorf also recently lobbied for General Electric and News Corporation on the issue of corporate tax policy. Congress is now considering legislation to strengthen airline passenger rights, after a senior citizen was bloodied, knocked semi-conscious and forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight to make room for a company employee. The efforts could face opposition from the industry trade group Airlines for America, another Elmendorf client. "We helped America's airline industry connect with policymakers," his firm’s website boasts. Another lobbyist, Vincent Roberti, Sr., has raised more than $88,000 for the DCCC year. He, too, has lobbied for Airlines for America. In recent months, Roberti has also lobbied on behalf of Citigroup, Pfizer, Boeing and AT&T. Unlike his colleagues, David Thomas, a partner at Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen & Thomas, didn’t collect money for Clinton’s 2016 committees. He’s been an active fundraiser for the DCCC this year, though, raising almost $106,000. Thomas has lobbied for Chevron, Humana, and United Technologies Corporation. In 2011, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported that New Mexico Rep. Ben Ray Lujan planned to decline donations from lobbyists. Lujan, who currently chairs the DCCC, quickly reversed course. The DCCC and the lobbyists raising money for the committee did not respond to requests for comment. This story is a collaboration between International Business Times' David Sirota and MapLight's Andrew Perez.

The software allows arbitrage sellers to place orders from multiple suppliers. Miami, United States - April 17, 2017 /PressCable/ -- Arbiship, an eBay Amazon automatic ordering tool for drop shipping sellers has launched with a promotion of 100 free orders for all new users.

On eBay, arbitrage involves buying hot or top-selling items at lower than usual prices and then selling them for a profit according. According to SaleHoo, with the most successful arbitrageurs generally making money by buying and selling in specialized areas. SaleHoo also reports that although an arbitrageur doesn't need to be a specialist in the products they are selling, it is necessary to know the market. Knowing the product and the target market increases success in marketing and turning items over quickly. Arbitrage is everywhere online, all the time. It might be hard to cleverly disguised, but it's true. Those who live in the USA and do a bit of online shopping have likely bought a plethora of arbitrage items without even realizing it. At least 1/4th of the items purchased online are from middle men such as arbitrage sellers. So what is this arbitrage, anyway? Arbitrage is a basic economics concept. The same idea can apply to any commodity that can be bought and resold - arbitrage is the art of finding a product at a low price from one supplier and selling it at a higher price to the customer. That might sound like a standard business, but the difference is that instead of buying discounted products wholesale, with eBay arbitrage sellers are often buying straight from an online retailer and getting them to ship direct to their customers. The seller is essentially a middleman, connecting lazy buyers with the products they can't be hassled to research. People often ask skeptically: "Does that really work?". The answer is yes, in fact it works incredibly well.

Arbiship is an advanced eBay arbitrage automatic ordering software that works with Amazon, Walmart and other online sellers. It allows users to edit and manage all of their records in one place and import or fill in supplier details, including any variations.The software automatically skips orders with cancellation requests, double checks addresses for accuracy and notifies users about problems before they occur.

The hotspot program uses devices provided by the Rochester Public Library. Two years after moving to Rochester, Mohamed Said sees his family making new connections. The Somalian refugee and father of two says it's due to a little device about the size of a cellphone. As a result, his wife, Faadumo Abdalla, is studying for her driver's license test and taking online classes. His 7-year-old daughter is finding help with her homework, and his 4-year-old daughter has become obsessed with "Dora the Explorer." The device is a mobile hotspot supplied through a Rochester Public Library pilot program. The library purchased 97 devices earlier this year, using a $30,000 donation from the Rochester Public Library Foundation. While 65 of the hotspots can be checked out at the library, Library Director Audrey Betcher said staff wanted to ensure others were specifically put into the hands of people who needed them the most. As a result, the library partnered with Olmsted County Community Services to ensure they went to families in need. "It's a huge barrier in our world," Betcher said of the internet access. With 32 devices in hand, Armin Budimlic, director of the county's Family Support and Assistance programs, asked agencies to target families in the Minnesota Family Investment Program and the Diversity Work Program. Workforce Development Inc. and Intercultural Mutual Assistance Association split the devices, which is how one landed with Said's family. While his family is using it for a variety of online activities, Said is has also been searching for new employment opportunities. He's employed at WalMart, but is hoping to find other work to better support his family. "The computer has helped him with that," said Intercultural Mutual Assistance Association caseworker Warda Hussein, who also served as an interpreter. IMAA Employment Program Manager Ahmed Osman said the benefits for most families, like Said's, go beyond individual uses. "You can see more family activities are being done," he said, noting in some cases parents help children with their homework and in others tech-savvy children help their parents fill out job applications. Cheri Fischer, a career counselor for Workforce Development, said she's witnessed similar family-related activities. "A lot of the older generation don't know how to navigate the laptops," she said, noting children frequently lend a hand. Both agencies provide laptops with the hotspots. Osman said that is a crucial component since many clients may only have older desktop computers that may not be equipped for a wireless signal. Others don't have access to a computer. Agency staff also noted the hotspots have been a boon to the work they do. Osman said his office frequently gets visits from clients and former clients who need help completing online applications, which can take at least an hour in the case of one major local employer. He said clients with laptops typically need less help, which creates more time to work with others, which is important since a growing number of jobs require online applications. "We have seen a tremendous improvement with our clients who have been allowed to get a hotspot," Hussein said. Fischer said many of the Workforce Development clients using the hotspots have transportation issues or may be unable to leave their homes due to disabilities or childcare needs. As a result, email access helps staff connect with them and offer advice from a distance. "It's also helped out a lot with people who are in post-secondary education programs," she said, noting they are better equipped to upgrade their employment opportunities. Said and Abdalla said the have noted one potential downfall. They said their children are learning English at a faster pace than they are, and they worry their daughters could lose the connection to their native tongue. Osman, however, encouraged them to see it as an opportunity. He said they can learn from their daughters' newfound knowledge while also teaching the young ones about their roots. He said he expects the devices will continue helping bridge and strengthen relationships. "Even watching movies will help them with language, too," he said after Said noted his family has been able to use the device for entertainment. What's your reaction?

The last marketing class of the week brought us a guest speaker, which I was happy about; marketing class was the one class that Dyson business freshman were constantly taking notes in. Not that the notes were needlessly drawn out — they were more or less a copied version of the ones found in our textbook. But it was a long textbook, and it was a short semester. The guest speaker was John Fogarty, who had been a student at Dyson before it became Dyson. Back in the pre-Dyson days, the Applied Economics and Management major was called “agricultural economics”, which was like poison to the ears to the parents of those who wanted to send their children to schools that would prepare them for business. But after the turn of the millennium, it was “applied” instead of “agricultural,” which somehow meant it was a richer education process. You might scoff, but the marketing pivot was genius. As one applicant’s parents explained in April after getting the college decisions, there daughter was choosing between Brown and Cornell, looking for something that would get a good job in finance. But the allure of “Applied Economics of Management” overshadowed any gap in prestige. The word choice paid off: the student was now one of my classmates. Mr. Fogarty was carved a different era, born from a different mindset. He wore his “blue collar” mentality proudly. “I got an offer from Goldman Sachs, and I turned them down.” He repeated it, with a shrug. He went to work for Wal-Mart’s business team because that’s what his heart wanted. It was a nice sentiment, but it was heresy to the students he was talking to. The unspoken assumption about Dyson is that a significant portion of the students want a career in finance. And not just a career in finance — on Wall Street, too. Banks! Big, bloody banks. There isn’t anything more intriguing and sexy than working on Wall Street for most students here. The most popular concentration is finance. The most popular clubs are financing and investment. The panels where banks come to meet students at Cornell are easily the most attended. I went to an entrepreneurship panel today — seven people showed up. Not to say Dyson is a Wharton wannabe. Wharton can be cold and menacing, angry and distant. One of the glowing rarities of AEM is the intimate setting it provides students. Each class of freshman is only about  100 students, allowing students to make stronger, friendlier connections. There’s something disarmingly charmful in how casual Dyson is. In comparison, Wharton is flooded with 600 freshmen each year, each one cockier than the one before. Waste a moment gasping for air, and you just might drown. But there are moments when I realize schools don’t define students. Their careers goals do. One night, while working in a group on a marketing assignment, we talk about the careers we want to embark on, and more implicitly, our career salaries. Actually — it was pretty damn explicit. One girl prattles on about her dream career. She looks through the career profile of a young banker, who’s working at a big bank with a name that rolls naturally off the tongue and into a pool of cash. “Hey, how much do you think first year associates at Goldman Sach’s get paid?” We shrug. Some ungodly number, perhaps. The conversation swings to me. I think about where I want to work. “You know, I might want to work at Frankfurt. I heard they do good international trade there.” I thought Frankfurt sounded like a romantic place to work. The Goldman girl smirks. “Why would you ever want to go there? There’s nothing there.” True, it wasn’t Wall Street. But should that matter? *** By the way, Mr. Fogarty isn’t done yet. Near the end of his talk about his career and why he chose it, he looks up at us, and takes aim at the zeitgeist. “How many of you are interested in a career on Wall Street?” Something interesting happens. In my head, I imagine at least a third of the class raising their hands. No — maybe half. Every year, Dyson sends scores of students to the banks on Wall Street: JP Morgan, Barclays, Deutsche and Goldman Sachs. And this isn’t to mention the inevitable horde of students who apply to Wall Street and rejected. In my mind, I see hands flying. We all look around. But not a single person raises their hand.   William Wang is a freshman in the College of Agricultural and Life Sciences.

REDDY | Lost in the Closet By Narayan Reddy April 17, 2017 For a long time since then I projected my insecurities on others. I felt like the only true way for me to be gay was to be unapologetically “fierce.” I acted and appeared as a stereotypical gay man and cut out anyone who I felt wasn’t with that. I began to see homophobia where it wasn’t. It took some hard looks in the mirror to see that me at my “fiercest” was me at my most repressed, most pretending to be something I’m not in blind pursuit of something that I thought I should be.

Schultze • Apr 17, 2017 TweetShareGoogle+Email Shelia Mendoza says she's not looking to make a living from Liberty, just some extra cash and conversation. M.L. SCHULTZE / WKSU       It's easy enough for people who live in cities to hail a ride, either from a taxi or a service like Uber or Lyft. There's plenty of demand, and plenty of drivers. A startup is trying to bring a similar service to rural America, but it has required some creative thinking. Listen Listening... / 4:11 A rural app -- and adaptation   The town of Van Wert sits on the western edge of Ohio. It's a stretch of flat farm country punctuated with grain silos and a stone castle that's listed as the nation's first county public library. CODE SWITCHHow Driverless Vehicles Could Harm Professional Drivers Of Color It doesn't seem like the first place a ride-hailing service would likely come. But Erica Petrie says maybe that's a mistake. Petrie is the mobility manager of the seven-county Area Agency on Aging. Her job is to find transportation options in Van Wert, which has no buses, one cab and a lot of needs. "The quick turnaround needs: 'Can someone help me get to the doctor?' We see short-term needs: 'Normally I'm able to drive, but my car's in the shop,' " she says. So Petrie helped recruit Liberty Mobility Now to Van Wert. The startup began in Nebraska about two years ago and has expanded to Texas and Ohio. It's also on its way to Colorado.   ALL TECH CONSIDEREDPittsburgh Offers Driving Lessons For Uber's Autonomous Cars Founder Valerie Lefler grew up on a dairy farm and worked on rural transportation issues at the University of Nebraska. She created Liberty as a business, but she talks about it as a mission — one requiring drivers to do more than leave customers at the door. "We really look for folks who are altruistic, that would want to do this anyway because that's what they would do for their best friend or their own mother," Lefler says. One of those people is Shelia Mendoza, whose mission in life, she says, is to be a grandma. Mendoza has worked for a dry cleaner and at a Wal-Mart. She's sold insurance, made RV cabinets and briefly ran Shelia's Cornucopia Cove. And when Liberty came to Van Wert two months ago, she was one of about a dozen drivers recruited and trained. The grandmother of 17 and self-described talker was a natural. That's because while part of Liberty's model is built on an app designed to work in rural geographies, much more of it is built on relationships. ALL TECH CONSIDEREDIn China, As In The U.S., The Fight Over Ride Hailing Is Local For example, Mendoza developed a relationship with her first customer who'd lost his license but found a job: the midnight shift at a meat processing plant. A county agency was willing to cover transportation costs for a few weeks until he could get his license back. "I always had him there five to 10 minutes early," Mendoza says. "We would stop and get coffee sometimes ... before he would go to work. Once in a while he paid for mine." Since he regained his license, things have slowed down for Mendoza. "I was happy he got his car, I was happy he got his license. He's a better person for that because I know he hated getting hauled around by an old lady," she says and laughs. She's hoping business will pick up, and her hopes rest with a lower-tech option Liberty is launching: a call center for those who don't or can't use an app. THE TWO-WAYGoogle Spinoff Sues Uber, Saying Leader Of Autonomous Vehicle Unit Stole Key Designs "I've heard a lot of people say, 'Well, I don't want nothing like that on my phone; I don't have room,' " she says. Scott Bogren of the Community Transportation Association of America, which specializes in smaller and rural transportation issues, says the call center shows that Liberty understands its target community. "The adult children of these seniors who can book rides for mom — they're going to use an online service," he says. "And combine that with the ability for mom to call in and talk to somebody that she can get to know — there's the sweet spot." Because of chronic transportation needs, Liberty is partnering with United Ways, hospitals, health departments and other social service agencies. AROUND THE NATIONRural Trump Voters Embrace The Sacrifices That Come With Support Rides cost $1.25 to book and $1 per mile. The fees are a small fraction of what the cabby charges, but Liberty says it will also make referrals if the taxi's a better fit. Petrie says all of that captures the spirit of the area. "I like that the drivers are from the communities," she says. "People are I think more polite, more neighborly. That's just what is going to fit here." Liberty Mobility is hoping to find similar fits all across America. M.L. Schultze is a reporter with NPR member station WKSU. You can follow her@MLSchultze.

If you’re willing to spend a little more, and maybe drive a little farther, you can enjoy the local stuff rather than what’s imported from Mexico or Peru. Several weeks after growers warned that federal trade policies could virtually eliminate Delta asparagus in the future, here are some places you still can find it. And this is by no means an exhaustive list. In the produce section Mexican asparagus is the most common variety found in a dozen Stockton supermarkets surveyed by The Record over the past several days. And it’s cheaper than the local stuff, typically running about $2 per pound. But a few stores around here do carry Delta asparagus — or at least, asparagus labeled as California- or U.S.-grown, though it’s not always entirely clear exactly where it’s coming from. Podesto’s is a sure bet, offering “Delta Queen” asparagus that is clearly labeled as originating from Klein Family Farms, based in Stockton. Yes, you’ll spend more than you would on foreign asparagus — $3.49 per pound, as of last week. Safeway, Walmart and Marina Marketplace all carry asparagus labeled as grown in California or the U.S., though specifics at the produce stands are lacking. The Raley’s on Morada Lane had both U.S. and Mexican asparagus as of late last week. You’ll find Mexican asparagus at Food 4 Less, Grocery Outlet Bargain Market, WinCo Foods, Smart & Final, Trader Joe’s, Save Mart and Rancho San Miguel. Straight to the source If grocery store labeling frustrates you, the closest you can get to asparagus straight from the field is to drive the 17 miles from Stockton to the Kings Crown packing shed, in Delta no-man’s-land at Tracy Boulevard and Clifton Court Road. The shed, owned by local asparagus farmers, is where the spears are taken to be cleaned, processed and packaged for shipment. But they sell directly to the public, too. A 3-pound bag costs $10, and a 9-pound bag costs $30, which is roughly comparable to what you’d pay at the grocery store. The shed is open seven days a week from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. It’s expected to remain open at least through Mother’s Day. “It’s cut every day,” farmer Joe Ratto said. “It’s fresh as it can be.” There’s always farmers markets, too. You should be able to find local asparagus at both the Stockton and San Joaquin certified farmers markets. Asparagus grower Roscoe Zuckerman also supplies Bay Area farmers markets from San Rafael to Los Gatos. Dining out Some Stockton restaurants still use local asparagus, though it’s getting harder and harder to find. Andy Pappas, owner at Papapavlo’s Bistro & Bar at Lincoln Center, said the restaurant still uses Delta asparagus as a side course and in soup. And you might find deep-fried asparagus there on occasion. Local asparagus “has a deep flavor that’s hard to beat, and we like supporting the local farmers,” Pappas said. Market Tavern features Delta asparagus, as does Midgley’s Public House, where you can even get an asparagus cigar (asparagus and cream cheese, in an egg roll wrapper with sweet chili sauce, according to the menu). San Joaquin Asparagus Festival If all else fails, you can still find Delta asparagus at the festival held in its honor, which takes place this weekend at the San Joaquin County Fairgrounds. Between 400 and 500 11-pound boxes will be available for sale at the festival, with 740 additional boxes used for cooking deep-friend asparagus and other goodies, said Ratto, the farmer. He had some good news to share on Monday: Delta growers have resumed harvesting asparagus. They had to stop several weeks ago due to very low prices for Mexican asparagus, but now the prices down south have rebounded, which puts Delta growers back in the ballgame. They still are deeply concerned about the future. The packing shed has produced 40,000 fewer boxes of asparagus than last year. Based on the phone calls they’ve received lately, however, it sure sounds like some Stocktonians are willing to pay more — and drive a little farther — for their asparagus fix. Said Ratto: “And that’s wonderful.” — Contact reporter Alex Breitler at (209) 546-8295 or abreitler@recordnet.com. Follow him at recordnet.com/breitlerblog and on Twitter @alexbreitler.

Christi Brown created the FlexEhoop, which has been on Walmart's website for about two weeks. She has also been a single mother since 2011. Brown created her product with some help after not having a lot of time to exercise and not liking any of the weighted hula hoops. “A lot of people have donated their time," said Brown. "I had a photographer donate her time for my product shots. It’s been wonderful how the community has come together to just help each other out.” She said being a single mother is a 24-hour job and can be tough at times. While working on entering the business world, Brown explained she lost the balance between entrepreneur and mother. “Cause at one point, I really felt like I was on a train that had suddenly dropped me off and I was holding on it and it was just out of control," Brown said. "It was just on its own path and I couldn’t catch up to it fast enough.” She eventually caught up to that train and now has her son involved with some of her business endeavors. At times, Brown said she wanted to give up on taking care of herself and was tired of living paycheck to paycheck. She said the idea of getting married was enticing just to have someone else to take care of her. Her advice to other single mothers is to not give in to those desires. Brown said those times will pass and any dream a person has is achievable no matter the situation. “If you don’t just do it and just step out there and make it happen no matter how uncomfortable you are, you’ll just stay in your little box," Brown said. "You won’t do it because you will be too terrified. All I can say is if I can do it then anybody can do it.” Brown hopes one day her product will be in schools for children to use even if for just a few minutes a day. She said she has also been talking with local chiropractors and physical therapists who she said are interested in using her product with patients.   Filed in: News Suggest a correction × Suggest A Correction Your name Your email Report a typo or grammatical error Cancel Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest LinkedIn Email Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Now, at the East Vancouver location on Hastings Street near Slocan, customers can pick from a newly added selection of more than 750 fresh food items — from chicken drumsticks and aged parmesan cheese to organic apples and cups of fresh berries.  It’s the first such store in B.C. for Shoppers, which has opened similar “enhanced convenience food sections” at 33 locations in the Toronto area and a few in Regina. It’ll open another one later this year on Cambie Road in Richmond and another eight smaller “grab and go” versions on West and East Broadway, Main, Granville and Homer streets in Vancouver.  Shoppers has chosen these outlets because of their “density, urban location and demographics,” and because they’re located where there currently isn’t a fresh food grocery option, said senior vice-president of merchandising Chong Bang. It’s part of a wider trend by large retail chains in North America — such as Target, Walgreens and Wal-Mart — to move into urban neighbourhoods, where analysts and executives see that consumers prefer to pick up groceries in smaller stores within walking distance of where they live. “I think that it’s a good distinction to make that we are not going to be a destination shop. People will still go to the grocery store. It’s more ‘hey, what can I make for dinner?’ and they pick up a pasta, a sauce and some protein, and mix and match,” said Bang at the East Hastings store, pointing out packs of ready-made soups and mixes, alongside packs of cooked sirloin steak and turkey breast strips.  Shoppers was bought in 2014 by Brampton, Ont.-based supermarket giant Loblaws Companies Ltd., which had previously purchased Richmond-based Asian grocer T&T Supermarket in 2009. It means Shoppers can offer a wide range of produce from Loblaws’ brands in its grocery locations, including President’s Choice and T&T’s popular Asian goods, from mini-almond cookies to pork dumplings. So while customers shouldn’t expect the vast range of services found at Walgreens’ U.S. “superstore” locations, where they can be wooed with baristas, juice bars and dedicated sushi chefs, they can pick up fresh T&T sushi made daily — an option that has already been very popular, according to Bang. Drug store chains and big-box retailers offering fresh food have generally aimed to compete with conventional rather than discount supermarkets on pricing. They also try to draw in customers with one-time specials and seasonal discounts on specific items, and Bang confirmed this will be the case at Shoppers. jlee-young@postmedia.com CLICK HERE to report a typo.

Claire Galofaro LEWISTON, Maine — The Associated Press Published Wednesday, Apr. 19, 2017 1:14AM EDT Last updated Wednesday, Apr. 19, 2017 1:14AM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print Richard Rodrigue stood in the back of a banquet hall, watching his blond-haired, blue-eyed daughter mingle among her high school classmates. These teenagers speak dozens of languages, and hail from a dozen African nations. They fled brutal civil war, famine, oppressive regimes to find themselves here, at an ordinary high school pre-prom fete in this once-dying New England mill town, revived by an influx of some 7,500 immigrants over the last 16 years. Rodrigue smiled and waved at his daughter, proud she is a part of it: "It will help her in life," he said. "The world is not all white." Rodrigue believes the refugees resuscitated his town — plugging the population drain that had threatened to cripple it, opening shops and restaurants in boarded-up storefronts. But he also agrees with Donald Trump that there should be no more of them, at least not now. America is struggling, he says, and needs to take care of its own before it takes care of anyone else. His working-class community, built along the banks of the Androscoggin River in the whitest state in America, is a place that some point to as proof that refugee integration can work. And yet for the first time in 30 years, voters in Androscoggin County chose a Republican for president, endorsing Trump's nativist zeal against the very sort of immigrants who share their streets and their schools. Rodrigue knows he was born on the winning end of the American dream. His grandfather fled poverty in Quebec and moved to Maine to toil his whole life in the textile mills. He never learned English, faced hate and discrimination. Two generations later, Rodrigue owns a successful security company, lives in a tidy house in a quiet neighbourhood and makes plans to send his daughter to college. Immigration worked for him. But it feels different today, as the county of 107,000 people tries to find its footing. The sprawling brick mills that line the river sit mostly shuttered. A quarter of children grow up poor. Taxpayers pick up the welfare tab. So Trump's supporters here tie their embrace of his immigration clampdown to their economic anxieties, and their belief that the newcomers are taking more than they have earned. "There's got to be a point in time when you have to say, 'Whoa, let's get the working people back up. Let's bring the money in. But they keep coming, keep coming," Rodrigue said. His community has been an experiment in immigration and all that comes with it — friendships, fear, triumphs, setbacks — and he knows that Trump's presidency marks another chapter in that struggle for the American soul. "I guess it just boils down to: What's enough? Is that wrong? Am I wrong? Am I bad? That's how I feel." ___ No one invited the Somali refugees to Lewiston. They fled bullets and warlords to eventually be chosen for resettlement in big American cities, where they were unnerved by the crime and drugs and noise. In early 2001, a few refugee families struggling to afford housing in Portland ventured 30 miles north and found a city in retreat. Empty downtown stores were ringed by sagging apartment buildings no longer needed to house workers because so few workers remained. The refugees saw possibility in Lewiston's decay. Word spread quickly, and friends and families followed. The town morphed in a matter of months into a laboratory for what happens when culture suddenly shifts. Maine's population is 94 per cent white, and its citizens were abruptly confronted with hundreds of black Muslims, traumatized by war and barely able to speak English. Ardo Mohamed came to Lewiston in 2001. She fled Mogadishu in the 1990s, when militiamen burst into the home she shared with her parents and nine siblings, and started shooting. She watched her father die, as the rest of the family escaped into the woods. They wound up in overcrowded refugee camps, separated for years, then finally Atlanta, then Lewiston. Now she fries sambusas with her sister at a shop she owns downtown. "We wanted to be safe," said the mother of five, "just like you do." When the refugees began arriving, Tabitha Beauchesne was a student at Lewiston High School. Her new classmates were poor, but Beauchesne was poor, too. She grew up in a struggling family in housing projects downtown. It felt to her then, and it still feels to her now, that the refugees got more help than her family. "They just seemed to take over," she said. She doesn't consider herself racist, though acknowledges that race and religion likely play a role in her sense that the refugees overwhelmed her community. The African Muslims, many of whom wear hijabs, stand out far more than her French-Canadian ancestors did when they arrived generations ago, she said. That perception — one of being inundated by a culture so different from her own — ingrained in her a sense of injustice so deep it persists to this day. She's now a stay-at-home mother of two, and she left Lewiston to move to another school district in the county because she believes the refugee students monopolize teachers' attention. Once a Barack Obama supporter, Beauchesne turned to Trump — and she cheers his efforts to curb the flow of refugees into the United States. She wants Trump to design a tax system that funnels less of her money to aiding those from other countries. "I just don't like giving money away that's not benefiting me and, not to sound selfish, but then seeing it benefit other people," she said. "As a business owner, my husband wouldn't donate $500 to the Salvation Army if we couldn't afford it. Our country needs to do the same thing." Taxpayers do help refugee families. Maine offers a welfare program called General Assistance, a combination of state and city funds, which provides impoverished people with vouchers for rent, utilities and food. In 2002, at the beginning of the immigrant influx, the city handed out about $343,000 in General Assistance funds, split almost evenly between native-born Mainers and refugees, according to city records. But rumours, largely unfounded, spread that the refugees were given free cars and apartments. Locals began calling City Hall to demand answers. Then-Mayor Laurier T. Raymond Jr. penned an open letter to the Somali community, asking that they divert friends and family away from a city he described as "maxed-out financially, physically and emotionally." The letter plunged Lewiston overnight into the global political cauldron. A white-supremacist group from out of state planned a rally against the Somali "invasion." Just a few people showed up. But across town 4,000 gathered in a gymnasium to support the Somalis and try to combat the reputation of Lewiston as a racist, xenophobic city that was rocketing around the world. And in that moment, the tide seemed to turn, deputy city administrator Phil Nadeau said. Even more immigrants came. Somali refugees gave way to those seeking asylum, from Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, a dozen nations in all. The immigrant population exploded from a handful of families to more than 7,000 people today, according to a tally by the Immigrant Resource Center of Maine. But the anxieties of old rarely seemed to resurface. Two years ago, immigrant children led the high school soccer team to win the state championship — a moment heralded as a triumph of cultural co-operation. Outside news crews still come from time to time, Nadeau said, and "they're always amazed that there's nothing bad to print." But around the edges of the city, in the suburbs and small towns that fill out the rest of Androscoggin County, many quietly stewed. It's there that Trump's "America First" message took root. ___ Thirty miles up the highway, Joyce Badeau greets customers by name at the hardware store where she works. She lives just outside Livermore Falls, population 3,187 — 3,035 of whom are white. She has little occasion to interact with immigrants, but her political views have been shaped by the idea of them. Badeau voted for Obama but backs Trump now, and points to his promise to rein in immigration as one reason why. "We're becoming a poor country because we're overloaded," she said. "We can't fix the system so long as we keep adding more broken pieces." She has watched the paper mills close and her neighbours lose good-paying jobs. But Badeau isn't naive; she doesn't believe Trump can make the mills roar back to life. That was a bygone era, replaced by email and iPhones. And his arrogance grates on her. But she hopes one day to turn on the news and not hear about crime and homelessness and terrorism — and she worries that someone who wants to hurt Americans might slip through porous borders. Trump promised to fix it all. If he can't, she's not sure what more America can offer immigrants. "Because they're leaving one country of problems and coming into another country of problems," she said. David Lovewell used to work at a paper mill just outside of Livermore Falls that has shed hundreds of jobs. Now he runs a logging company with his sons, but he sees a dim future for them. A few months ago, business got so bad he laid off eight employees and fell behind on his $5,500 monthly payments on the machines he uses to cut down trees. He looked down at his sneakers, bought for $25 at Walmart. There used to be two shoe factories nearby. He wants Trump to stop his town's slow slip toward irrelevancy. Lovewell doesn't like to talk about immigration. He sighs and rubs his head, afraid to seem racist or indifferent to pain and poverty around the world. He went on a cruise to Belize with his wife several years ago, when he still worked at the mill and could afford a vacation. He stopped to buy a carving from an old man whose hands were so worn from years of whittling they looked like leather. He remembers those hands still, and the man's dirt-floor shack with no doors and his skinny, starving dog and the kids riding around on broken bicycles. "I struggled with it, when he did the travel ban," Lovewell said of Trump. "At the same time, I'm seeing ... people losing their jobs. Why are we so worried about immigrants coming into our country when we can't really take care of our own people?" So he's looking to Trump to strike a better balance — to build an economy where his sons don't have to battle to barely get by, and only after that design an immigration system that keeps America's promise of open arms. "I guess it could sound like bigotry," he said. "But we're hurting. Americans are hurting." ___ Politicians have seized on the discontent. Last August, candidate Trump stood on a stage in Portland and singled out the Somali community as causing a crime wave. The Lewiston police chief quickly refuted the charge — crime has decreased dramatically since the refugees arrived — but it stuck in the minds of many. Maine's Republican governor, Paul LePage, has called asylum-seekers "the biggest problem in our state," and suggested they bring danger and disease. And in Androscoggin County, Republican leaders hammer the issue of refugee resettlement on their Facebook page, with post after post about the injustice they see in taxpayers helping them with assistance. They've dubbed it "the refugee racket," and complain that the school system is forced to accommodate 34 languages. Lewiston School Superintendent Bill Webster acknowledges that does cost money. But he has a statistic he likes to share with the critics. Historically, Lewiston has had some of the lowest high school graduation rates in the state. Now, immigrant children are doing better than native-born kids. Some were illiterate in their native language when they set out to learn English. Yet an average of 78.3 per cent of immigrant students graduate high school within five years, compared to an average of 73.3 per cent of native students. Fifteen years ago, the school district had an enrolment of 4,500 students and falling — a sign of a city on its knees, Webster said. Today, there are 5,400 students, more than one-quarter of them immigrants, and the number is going up. And now the immigrant children who grew up here are going off to college to get degrees, as teachers, doctors, engineers. Several years ago, Webster and his wife sold their home in the suburbs and rented an apartment in downtown Lewiston, across the street from a mosque. They can stroll to dinner, past a yoga studio and a shop that sells artisan olive oil. There are also dozens of immigrant-owned businesses, like the Mogadishu Business Center — with two flags hanging in the window, one American and one Somali. Remaining vacant storefronts have signs in the windows, promising prospective buyers an opportunity to "be part of Lewiston's great rebirth." "We never have the opportunity to redo time under a different set of assumptions," Webster said. "But if the immigrant population hadn't happened, Lewiston would be a community that was contracting, and potentially in a downward death spiral." Organizations that work with immigrants nevertheless must fight on to combat deep-seated distrust. Catholic Charities publishes a fact sheet called "The Top Ten Myths about Somalis and Why They Are Wrong." It lists untruths like, "Somalis are draining the welfare coffers," ''Somalis get free apartments," even "Somalis keep live chickens in their kitchen cupboards." Maine's immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa made $136.6 million in income in 2014, and paid $40 million in taxes, according to one report from a bipartisan think-tank. But they largely work in invisible jobs, said Catherine Besteman, a professor of anthropology at Maine's Colby College. They take out trash at hotels, do the laundry at the hospital. People don't see them working, she said, so when they see them driving a car, or shopping for groceries, it becomes easy to assume they got it for free. That leaves some here still feeling that the immigrants take more than they deserve. Tabitha Beauchesne pulled a bag of bargain-brand cereal out of her kitchen cabinet to demonstrate that point. At the grocery store, she said, she sees immigrant mothers with carts piled high with name-brand food. "I guess I'm jealous of that. I would love to buy my kids the real Fruit Roll-Ups," she said. "But, no, sorry kids, you get the fruit packets from Walmart." ___ So Mohamed Ibrahim now knocks on doors. "Hello," he says to strangers across Androscoggin County. "I am a Muslim. I was welcomed by America. I was helped by General Assistance, and that was coming from your pockets and I am grateful. I became a taxpayer. I'm not taking anything. Now I am giving." He wants his neighbours to know him, to know that he is normal. Trump's election here taught him he has a lot more work to do. "We thought, 'Yay, it's perfect.' But everything was slipping." Ibrahim came in 2012 from Djibouti, where he risked imprisonment for opposing his government. He is one of the thousands who have flooded into Lewiston in recent years because they are seeking asylum from oppression. With them came a spike in the amount of taxpayer assistance going to immigrants. Asylum-seekers, unlike resettled refugees, are barred from getting work permits for at least six months and many, like Ibrahim, must rely on government assistance to get by when they first arrive. The amount paid to immigrants jumped recently to nearly a half-million dollars. And there seems to be more tension in town since Trump took office. One woman reported she was nearly run down by a screaming driver; another said someone jerked her hijab and told her to go back where she came from. Ardo Mohamed, the Somali who cooks sambusas with her sister, is an American citizen now. Her children were born in the United States. But they worry the government will come to send her away. "We are scared," she said. "They say every night, 'Mom, if they take you, where we do live?'" Ibrahim does not blame his neighbours for supporting Trump, because he's seen the pull of populism before. When his friends complain about the policies on immigration, he reminds them of the day, more than a decade ago, that the interior minister of their country ordered all illegal immigrants to leave or face mass arrest. He asks them how they felt, and they respond: patriotic - like their government was looking out for them. Ibrahim has his own hopes for the president. He hopes Trump will build an immigration system that gives people confidence that those coming are good and hardworking - so that, one day, people like him will be called Americans, not refugees. But he worries it will come at a cost. In 50 years, he thinks, the descendants of his fellow African immigrants will be suspicious of whoever comes next. "That's how it's been through history. The Irish were discriminated against, and then they discriminated against the French. The French were discriminated against, now they discriminate against us, at the bottom of the ladder," he said, laughing uncomfortably. "I don't hope for that, it is not my wish. We can change. But still, we are stuck being human beings." ___ AP data journalist Angeliki Kastanis contributed to this report. ___ Read more of AP's coverage of Americans looking to Trump for change: http://tinyurl.com/n7a2hvl This content appears as provided to The Globe by the originating wire service.

LEWISTON, Maine >> Richard Rodrigue stood in the back of a banquet hall, watching his blond-haired, blue-eyed daughter mingle among her high school classmates. These teenagers speak dozens of languages, and hail from a dozen African nations. They fled brutal civil war, famine, oppressive regimes to find themselves here, at an ordinary high school pre-prom fete in this once-dying New England mill town, revived by an influx of some 7,500 immigrants over the last 16 years. Rodrigue smiled and waved at his daughter, proud she is a part of it: “It will help her in life,” he said. “The world is not all white.” Rodrigue believes the refugees resuscitated his town — plugging the population drain that had threatened to cripple it, opening shops and restaurants in boarded-up storefronts. But he also agrees with Donald Trump that there should be no more of them, at least not now. America is struggling, he says, and needs to take care of its own before it takes care of anyone else. His working-class community, built along the banks of the Androscoggin River in the whitest state in America, is a place that some point to as proof that refugee integration can work. And yet for the first time in 30 years, voters in Androscoggin County chose a Republican for president, endorsing Trump’s nativist zeal against the very sort of immigrants who share their streets and their schools. Rodrigue knows he was born on the winning end of the American dream. His grandfather fled poverty in Quebec and moved to Maine to toil his whole life in the textile mills. He never learned English, faced hate and discrimination. Two generations later, Rodrigue owns a successful security company, lives in a tidy house in a quiet neighborhood and makes plans to send his daughter to college. Immigration worked for him. But it feels different today, as the county of 107,000 people tries to find its footing. The sprawling brick mills that line the river sit mostly shuttered. A quarter of children grow up poor. Taxpayers pick up the welfare tab. So Trump’s supporters here tie their embrace of his immigration clampdown to their economic anxieties, and their belief that the newcomers are taking more than they have earned. “There’s got to be a point in time when you have to say, ‘Whoa, let’s get the working people back up. Let’s bring the money in. But they keep coming, keep coming,” Rodrigue said. His community has been an experiment in immigration and all that comes with it — friendships, fear, triumphs, setbacks — and he knows that Trump’s presidency marks another chapter in that struggle for the American soul. “I guess it just boils down to: What’s enough? Is that wrong? Am I wrong? Am I bad? That’s how I feel.” — No one invited the Somali refugees to Lewiston. They fled bullets and warlords to eventually be chosen for resettlement in big American cities, where they were unnerved by the crime and drugs and noise. In early 2001, a few refugee families struggling to afford housing in Portland ventured 30 miles north and found a city in retreat. Empty downtown stores were ringed by sagging apartment buildings no longer needed to house workers because so few workers remained. The refugees saw possibility in Lewiston’s decay. Word spread quickly, and friends and families followed. The town morphed in a matter of months into a laboratory for what happens when culture suddenly shifts. Maine’s population is 94 percent white, and its citizens were abruptly confronted with hundreds of black Muslims, traumatized by war and barely able to speak English. Ardo Mohamed came to Lewiston in 2001. She fled Mogadishu in the 1990s, when militiamen burst into the home she shared with her parents and nine siblings, and started shooting. She watched her father die, as the rest of the family escaped into the woods. They wound up in overcrowded refugee camps, separated for years, then finally Atlanta, then Lewiston. Now she fries sambusas with her sister at a shop she owns downtown. “We wanted to be safe,” said the mother of five, “just like you do.” When the refugees began arriving, Tabitha Beauchesne was a student at Lewiston High School. Her new classmates were poor, but Beauchesne was poor, too. She grew up in a struggling family in housing projects downtown. It felt to her then, and it still feels to her now, that the refugees got more help than her family. “They just seemed to take over,” she said. She doesn’t consider herself racist, though acknowledges that race and religion likely play a role in her sense that the refugees overwhelmed her community. The African Muslims, many of whom wear hijabs, stand out far more than her French-Canadian ancestors did when they arrived generations ago, she said. That perception — one of being inundated by a culture so different from her own — ingrained in her a sense of injustice so deep it persists to this day. She’s now a stay-at-home mother of two, and she left Lewiston to move to another school district in the county because she believes the refugee students monopolize teachers’ attention. Once a Barack Obama supporter, Beauchesne turned to Trump — and she cheers his efforts to curb the flow of refugees into the United States. She wants Trump to design a tax system that funnels less of her money to aiding those from other countries. “I just don’t like giving money away that’s not benefiting me and, not to sound selfish, but then seeing it benefit other people,” she said. “As a business owner, my husband wouldn’t donate $500 to the Salvation Army if we couldn’t afford it. Our country needs to do the same thing.” Taxpayers do help refugee families. Maine offers a welfare program called General Assistance, a combination of state and city funds, which provides impoverished people with vouchers for rent, utilities and food. In 2002, at the beginning of the immigrant influx, the city handed out about $343,000 in General Assistance funds, split almost evenly between native-born Mainers and refugees, according to city records. But rumors, largely unfounded, spread that the refugees were given free cars and apartments. Locals began calling City Hall to demand answers. Then-Mayor Laurier T. Raymond Jr. penned an open letter to the Somali community, asking that they divert friends and family away from a city he described as “maxed-out financially, physically and emotionally.” The letter plunged Lewiston overnight into the global political cauldron. A white-supremacist group from out of state planned a rally against the Somali “invasion.” Just a few people showed up. But across town 4,000 gathered in a gymnasium to support the Somalis and try to combat the reputation of Lewiston as a racist, xenophobic city that was rocketing around the world. And in that moment, the tide seemed to turn, deputy city administrator Phil Nadeau said. Even more immigrants came. Somali refugees gave way to those seeking asylum, from Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, a dozen nations in all. The immigrant population exploded from a handful of families to more than 7,000 people today, according to a tally by the Immigrant Resource Center of Maine. But the anxieties of old rarely seemed to resurface. Two years ago, immigrant children led the high school soccer team to win the state championship — a moment heralded as a triumph of cultural cooperation. Outside news crews still come from time to time, Nadeau said, and “they’re always amazed that there’s nothing bad to print.” But around the edges of the city, in the suburbs and small towns that fill out the rest of Androscoggin County, many quietly stewed. It’s there that Trump’s “America First” message took root. — Thirty miles up the highway, Joyce Badeau greets customers by name at the hardware store where she works. She lives just outside Livermore Falls, population 3,187 — 3,035 of whom are white. She has little occasion to interact with immigrants, but her political views have been shaped by the idea of them. Badeau voted for Obama but backs Trump now, and points to his promise to rein in immigration as one reason why. “We’re becoming a poor country because we’re overloaded,” she said. “We can’t fix the system so long as we keep adding more broken pieces.” She has watched the paper mills close and her neighbors lose good-paying jobs. But Badeau isn’t naive; she doesn’t believe Trump can make the mills roar back to life. That was a bygone era, replaced by email and iPhones. And his arrogance grates on her. But she hopes one day to turn on the news and not hear about crime and homelessness and terrorism — and she worries that someone who wants to hurt Americans might slip through porous borders. Trump promised to fix it all. If he can’t, she’s not sure what more America can offer immigrants. “Because they’re leaving one country of problems and coming into another country of problems,” she said. David Lovewell used to work at a paper mill just outside of Livermore Falls that has shed hundreds of jobs. Now he runs a logging company with his sons, but he sees a dim future for them. A few months ago, business got so bad he laid off eight employees and fell behind on his $5,500 monthly payments on the machines he uses to cut down trees.

Using modern planting techniques, Chengmai County has turned its formerly barren sandy soil into a hotbed for cash. Standing on the edge of a field, Wang Wenke took phone orders from across the country as he watched the harvest on a sunny April day. Sweet potato produced in Chengmai County is nutritious, delicious, relatively uniform in shape, has a high yield and sells at 52 yuan (7.5 U.S. dollars) per kilogram, 10 times the average for sweet potatoes. Seeing the profit potential of the sweet potato, university graduate Wang, son of a local farmer, returned home in 2007. "I just couldn't forget the fantastic taste," he recalled, adding that the selenium-rich soil is another reason he was confident in the market prospects. Chengmai is renowned for the longevity of its residents and is home to over 200 centenarians, partly thanks to its selenium-rich crops. Yang Yingchun, deputy Party head of the village, recalls a local agricultural company imported Japanese sweet potato seedlings that suited the local sandy soil in 1996, but planting was not widespread until Wang's return. Using the seedlings, Wang sought help from Hainan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, which developed virus-free seedlings. Under a microscope, a seedling is cut to only 0.2 millimeter to eliminate viruses, which has ensured a yield increase of 30 percent and better taste and shape. The method of planting is also different. The soil is humid enough and abundant with organic materials so no chemical fertilizer is needed. Farmers plant the seedlings every 20 cm on a 40-cm-high ridge. "The standard distance leaves growth space which helps ensure uniformity of size of each sweet potato," said Wang. The technique was quickly copied when Wang made 200,000 yuan profit on six hectares in the very first year. Last year, total coverage of sweet potato farmland had reached 1,600 hectares. The township secured a total yield of 42,000 tonnes last year, bringing in 420 million yuan. China aims to eradicate poverty by 2020. It has lifted 700 million people out of poverty over about 30 years, but in the coming years poverty relief work will become increasingly difficult as it nears its end. There were still 43 million people living in poverty last year, mostly in rural areas. The "No. 1 central document" issued in January encouraged supply-side reform in agriculture to increase the output of high-quality products based on green and innovative production. A group of innovation centers and alliances will be created, and outstanding research will be rewarded, according to the document. To maximize sweet potato sales profit, Wang's village registered a sweet potato brand in 2009, and organized uniform packaging of the brand, according to Shen Xinxia, Party head of Qiaotou Township. The local government regularly organized branding activities and helped set up a sweet potato research institute. A total of 184 online outlets have brought in annual sales of 30 million yuan, including 10 million yuan from overseas. Benefiting from the sweet potato industry, annual income per household had reached 80,000 yuan in the township. The number of impoverished households reduced from 1,390 in 2007 to 19 in 2016. Shen says their sweet potatoes are sold to major supermarket chains like Carrefour and Walmart across China, and exported to countries such as Canada, Japan and Singapore. Similar production flows are being utilized for lychee, grapefruit and orange production.

That’s how I feel.” David Goldman AP Photo 1 of 47 National Business April 19, 2017 12:21 AM How a community changed by refugees came to embrace Trump By CLAIRE GALOFARO Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story LEWISTON, Maine Richard Rodrigue stood in the back of a banquet hall, watching his blond-haired, blue-eyed daughter mingle among her high school classmates. These teenagers speak dozens of languages, and hail from a dozen African nations. They fled brutal civil war, famine, oppressive regimes to find themselves here, at an ordinary high school pre-prom fete in this once-dying New England mill town, revived by an influx of some 7,500 immigrants over the last 16 years. Rodrigue smiled and waved at his daughter, proud she is a part of it: "It will help her in life," he said. "The world is not all white." Rodrigue believes the refugees resuscitated his town — plugging the population drain that had threatened to cripple it, opening shops and restaurants in boarded-up storefronts. But he also agrees with Donald Trump that there should be no more of them, at least not now. America is struggling, he says, and needs to take care of its own before it takes care of anyone else. His working-class community, built along the banks of the Androscoggin River in the whitest state in America, is a place that some point to as proof that refugee integration can work. And yet for the first time in 30 years, voters in Androscoggin County chose a Republican for president, endorsing Trump's nativist zeal against the very sort of immigrants who share their streets and their schools. Rodrigue knows he was born on the winning end of the American dream. His grandfather fled poverty in Quebec and moved to Maine to toil his whole life in the textile mills. He never learned English, faced hate and discrimination. Two generations later, Rodrigue owns a successful security company, lives in a tidy house in a quiet neighborhood and makes plans to send his daughter to college. Immigration worked for him. But it feels different today, as the county of 107,000 people tries to find its footing. The sprawling brick mills that line the river sit mostly shuttered. A quarter of children grow up poor. Taxpayers pick up the welfare tab. So Trump's supporters here tie their embrace of his immigration clampdown to their economic anxieties, and their belief that the newcomers are taking more than they have earned. "There's got to be a point in time when you have to say, 'Whoa, let's get the working people back up. Let's bring the money in. But they keep coming, keep coming," Rodrigue said. His community has been an experiment in immigration and all that comes with it — friendships, fear, triumphs, setbacks — and he knows that Trump's presidency marks another chapter in that struggle for the American soul. "I guess it just boils down to: What's enough? Is that wrong? Am I wrong? Am I bad? That's how I feel." ___ No one invited the Somali refugees to Lewiston. They fled bullets and warlords to eventually be chosen for resettlement in big American cities, where they were unnerved by the crime and drugs and noise. In early 2001, a few refugee families struggling to afford housing in Portland ventured 30 miles north and found a city in retreat. Empty downtown stores were ringed by sagging apartment buildings no longer needed to house workers because so few workers remained. The refugees saw possibility in Lewiston's decay. Word spread quickly, and friends and families followed. The town morphed in a matter of months into a laboratory for what happens when culture suddenly shifts. Maine's population is 94 percent white, and its citizens were abruptly confronted with hundreds of black Muslims, traumatized by war and barely able to speak English. Ardo Mohamed came to Lewiston in 2001. She fled Mogadishu in the 1990s, when militiamen burst into the home she shared with her parents and nine siblings, and started shooting. She watched her father die, as the rest of the family escaped into the woods. They wound up in overcrowded refugee camps, separated for years, then finally Atlanta, then Lewiston. Now she fries sambusas with her sister at a shop she owns downtown. "We wanted to be safe," said the mother of five, "just like you do." When the refugees began arriving, Tabitha Beauchesne was a student at Lewiston High School. Her new classmates were poor, but Beauchesne was poor, too. She grew up in a struggling family in housing projects downtown. It felt to her then, and it still feels to her now, that the refugees got more help than her family. "They just seemed to take over," she said. She doesn't consider herself racist, though acknowledges that race and religion likely play a role in her sense that the refugees overwhelmed her community. The African Muslims, many of whom wear hijabs, stand out far more than her French-Canadian ancestors did when they arrived generations ago, she said. That perception — one of being inundated by a culture so different from her own — ingrained in her a sense of injustice so deep it persists to this day. She's now a stay-at-home mother of two, and she left Lewiston to move to another school district in the county because she believes the refugee students monopolize teachers' attention. Once a Barack Obama supporter, Beauchesne turned to Trump — and she cheers his efforts to curb the flow of refugees into the United States. She wants Trump to design a tax system that funnels less of her money to aiding those from other countries. "I just don't like giving money away that's not benefiting me and, not to sound selfish, but then seeing it benefit other people," she said. "As a business owner, my husband wouldn't donate $500 to the Salvation Army if we couldn't afford it. Our country needs to do the same thing." Taxpayers do help refugee families. Maine offers a welfare program called General Assistance, a combination of state and city funds, which provides impoverished people with vouchers for rent, utilities and food. In 2002, at the beginning of the immigrant influx, the city handed out about $343,000 in General Assistance funds, split almost evenly between native-born Mainers and refugees, according to city records. But rumors, largely unfounded, spread that the refugees were given free cars and apartments. Locals began calling City Hall to demand answers. Then-Mayor Laurier T. Raymond Jr. penned an open letter to the Somali community, asking that they divert friends and family away from a city he described as "maxed-out financially, physically and emotionally." The letter plunged Lewiston overnight into the global political cauldron. A white-supremacist group from out of state planned a rally against the Somali "invasion." Just a few people showed up. But across town 4,000 gathered in a gymnasium to support the Somalis and try to combat the reputation of Lewiston as a racist, xenophobic city that was rocketing around the world. And in that moment, the tide seemed to turn, deputy city administrator Phil Nadeau said. Even more immigrants came. Somali refugees gave way to those seeking asylum, from Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, a dozen nations in all. The immigrant population exploded from a handful of families to more than 7,000 people today, according to a tally by the Immigrant Resource Center of Maine. But the anxieties of old rarely seemed to resurface. Two years ago, immigrant children led the high school soccer team to win the state championship — a moment heralded as a triumph of cultural cooperation. Outside news crews still come from time to time, Nadeau said, and "they're always amazed that there's nothing bad to print." But around the edges of the city, in the suburbs and small towns that fill out the rest of Androscoggin County, many quietly stewed. It's there that Trump's "America First" message took root. ___ Thirty miles up the highway, Joyce Badeau greets customers by name at the hardware store where she works. She lives just outside Livermore Falls, population 3,187 — 3,035 of whom are white. She has little occasion to interact with immigrants, but her political views have been shaped by the idea of them. Badeau voted for Obama but backs Trump now, and points to his promise to rein in immigration as one reason why. "We're becoming a poor country because we're overloaded," she said. "We can't fix the system so long as we keep adding more broken pieces." She has watched the paper mills close and her neighbors lose good-paying jobs. But Badeau isn't naive; she doesn't believe Trump can make the mills roar back to life. That was a bygone era, replaced by email and iPhones. And his arrogance grates on her. But she hopes one day to turn on the news and not hear about crime and homelessness and terrorism — and she worries that someone who wants to hurt Americans might slip through porous borders. Trump promised to fix it all. If he can't, she's not sure what more America can offer immigrants. "Because they're leaving one country of problems and coming into another country of problems," she said. David Lovewell used to work at a paper mill just outside of Livermore Falls that has shed hundreds of jobs. Now he runs a logging company with his sons, but he sees a dim future for them. A few months ago, business got so bad he laid off eight employees and fell behind on his $5,500 monthly payments on the machines he uses to cut down trees. He looked down at his sneakers, bought for $25 at Walmart. There used to be two shoe factories nearby. He wants Trump to stop his town's slow slip toward irrelevancy. Lovewell doesn't like to talk about immigration. He sighs and rubs his head, afraid to seem racist or indifferent to pain and poverty around the world. He went on a cruise to Belize with his wife several years ago, when he still worked at the mill and could afford a vacation. He stopped to buy a carving from an old man whose hands were so worn from years of whittling they looked like leather. He remembers those hands still, and the man's dirt-floor shack with no doors and his skinny, starving dog and the kids riding around on broken bicycles. "I struggled with it, when he did the travel ban," Lovewell said of Trump. "At the same time, I'm seeing ... people losing their jobs. Why are we so worried about immigrants coming into our country when we can't really take care of our own people?" So he's looking to Trump to strike a better balance — to build an economy where his sons don't have to battle to barely get by, and only after that design an immigration system that keeps America's promise of open arms. "I guess it could sound like bigotry," he said. "But we're hurting. Americans are hurting." ___ Politicians have seized on the discontent. Last August, candidate Trump stood on a stage in Portland and singled out the Somali community as causing a crime wave. The Lewiston police chief quickly refuted the charge — crime has decreased dramatically since the refugees arrived — but it stuck in the minds of many. Maine's Republican governor, Paul LePage, has called asylum-seekers "the biggest problem in our state," and suggested they bring danger and disease. And in Androscoggin County, Republican leaders hammer the issue of refugee resettlement on their Facebook page, with post after post about the injustice they see in taxpayers helping them with assistance. They've dubbed it "the refugee racket," and complain that the school system is forced to accommodate 34 languages. Lewiston School Superintendent Bill Webster acknowledges that does cost money. But he has a statistic he likes to share with the critics. Historically, Lewiston has had some of the lowest high school graduation rates in the state. Now, immigrant children are doing better than native-born kids. Some were illiterate in their native language when they set out to learn English. Yet an average of 78.3 percent of immigrant students graduate high school within five years, compared to an average of 73.3 percent of native students. Fifteen years ago, the school district had an enrollment of 4,500 students and falling — a sign of a city on its knees, Webster said. Today, there are 5,400 students, more than one-quarter of them immigrants, and the number is going up. And now the immigrant children who grew up here are going off to college to get degrees, as teachers, doctors, engineers. Several years ago, Webster and his wife sold their home in the suburbs and rented an apartment in downtown Lewiston, across the street from a mosque. They can stroll to dinner, past a yoga studio and a shop that sells artisan olive oil. There are also dozens of immigrant-owned businesses, like the Mogadishu Business Center — with two flags hanging in the window, one American and one Somali. Remaining vacant storefronts have signs in the windows, promising prospective buyers an opportunity to "be part of Lewiston's great rebirth." "We never have the opportunity to redo time under a different set of assumptions," Webster said. "But if the immigrant population hadn't happened, Lewiston would be a community that was contracting, and potentially in a downward death spiral." Organizations that work with immigrants nevertheless must fight on to combat deep-seated distrust. Catholic Charities publishes a fact sheet called "The Top Ten Myths about Somalis and Why They Are Wrong." It lists untruths like, "Somalis are draining the welfare coffers," ''Somalis get free apartments," even "Somalis keep live chickens in their kitchen cupboards." Maine's immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa made $136.6 million in income in 2014, and paid $40 million in taxes, according to one report from a bipartisan think-tank. But they largely work in invisible jobs, said Catherine Besteman, a professor of anthropology at Maine's Colby College. They take out trash at hotels, do the laundry at the hospital. People don't see them working, she said, so when they see them driving a car, or shopping for groceries, it becomes easy to assume they got it for free. That leaves some here still feeling that the immigrants take more than they deserve. Tabitha Beauchesne pulled a bag of bargain-brand cereal out of her kitchen cabinet to demonstrate that point. At the grocery store, she said, she sees immigrant mothers with carts piled high with name-brand food. "I guess I'm jealous of that. I would love to buy my kids the real Fruit Roll-Ups," she said. "But, no, sorry kids, you get the fruit packets from Walmart." ___ So Mohamed Ibrahim now knocks on doors. "Hello," he says to strangers across Androscoggin County. "I am a Muslim. I was welcomed by America. I was helped by General Assistance, and that was coming from your pockets and I am grateful. I became a taxpayer. I'm not taking anything. Now I am giving." He wants his neighbors to know him, to know that he is normal. Trump's election here taught him he has a lot more work to do. "We thought, 'Yay, it's perfect.' But everything was slipping." Ibrahim came in 2012 from Djibouti, where he risked imprisonment for opposing his government. He is one of the thousands who have flooded into Lewiston in recent years because they are seeking asylum from oppression. With them came a spike in the amount of taxpayer assistance going to immigrants. Asylum-seekers, unlike resettled refugees, are barred from getting work permits for at least six months and many, like Ibrahim, must rely on government assistance to get by when they first arrive. The amount paid to immigrants jumped recently to nearly a half-million dollars. And there seems to be more tension in town since Trump took office. One woman reported she was nearly run down by a screaming driver; another said someone jerked her hijab and told her to go back where she came from. Ardo Mohamed, the Somali who cooks sambusas with her sister, is an American citizen now. Her children were born in the United States. But they worry the government will come to send her away. "We are scared," she said. "They say every night, 'Mom, if they take you, where we do live?'" Ibrahim does not blame his neighbors for supporting Trump, because he's seen the pull of populism before. When his friends complain about the policies on immigration, he reminds them of the day, more than a decade ago, that the interior minister of their country ordered all illegal immigrants to leave or face mass arrest. He asks them how they felt, and they respond: patriotic - like their government was looking out for them. Ibrahim has his own hopes for the president. He hopes Trump will build an immigration system that gives people confidence that those coming are good and hardworking - so that, one day, people like him will be called Americans, not refugees. But he worries it will come at a cost. In 50 years, he thinks, the descendants of his fellow African immigrants will be suspicious of whoever comes next. "That's how it's been through history. The Irish were discriminated against, and then they discriminated against the French. The French were discriminated against, now they discriminate against us, at the bottom of the ladder," he said, laughing uncomfortably. "I don't hope for that, it is not my wish. We can change. But still, we are stuck being human beings." ___ AP data journalist Angeliki Kastanis contributed to this report.

Shaleh, whose family is from Somalia, waited with them for several years in a refugee camp in Kenya before coming to the United States and eventually settling in Lewiston. Shaleh said President Donald Trump's election has created fear in the refugee community, including among the many students who come from immigrant families. Shaleh also worries about the many refugees who are suffering in Somalia and other parts of Africa, where famine remains a huge issue. "We got that chance to come to America)," he said. "I just wanted them to have the same chance."

A few months earlier, business got so bad he came close to losing it all, and it reminded him just how fragile the blue collar economy can be. He looked down at his sneakers, which he bought for $25 at Walmart. There used to be a shoe factory in town, he said, and another one just down the road. "They're gone, they're done," he said. "And now I'm wearing shoes from China." That's why he voted for Donald Trump, because he doesn't want to have to buy shoes made someplace else.

She watched her father die, as the rest of the family ran into the woods to escape. They wound up in overcrowded refugee camps, separated for years, then Atlanta, then Lewiston.

Though he is conflicted; "There's got to be a point in time when you have to say, 'whoa, let's get the working people back up, let's bring the money in.' But they keep coming, keep coming," Rodrigue said. “I guess it just boils down to: What’s enough? Is that wrong? Am I wrong? Am I bad? That’s how I feel.” David Goldman AP Photo 1 of 47 Business April 19, 2017 12:21 AM How a community changed by refugees came to embrace Trump By CLAIRE GALOFARO Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story LEWISTON, Maine Richard Rodrigue stood in the back of a banquet hall, watching his blond-haired, blue-eyed daughter mingle among her high school classmates. These teenagers speak dozens of languages, and hail from a dozen African nations. They fled brutal civil war, famine, oppressive regimes to find themselves here, at an ordinary high school pre-prom fete in this once-dying New England mill town, revived by an influx of some 7,500 immigrants over the last 16 years. Rodrigue smiled and waved at his daughter, proud she is a part of it: "It will help her in life," he said. "The world is not all white." Rodrigue believes the refugees resuscitated his town — plugging the population drain that had threatened to cripple it, opening shops and restaurants in boarded-up storefronts. But he also agrees with Donald Trump that there should be no more of them, at least not now. America is struggling, he says, and needs to take care of its own before it takes care of anyone else. His working-class community, built along the banks of the Androscoggin River in the whitest state in America, is a place that some point to as proof that refugee integration can work. And yet for the first time in 30 years, voters in Androscoggin County chose a Republican for president, endorsing Trump's nativist zeal against the very sort of immigrants who share their streets and their schools. Rodrigue knows he was born on the winning end of the American dream. His grandfather fled poverty in Quebec and moved to Maine to toil his whole life in the textile mills. He never learned English, faced hate and discrimination. Two generations later, Rodrigue owns a successful security company, lives in a tidy house in a quiet neighborhood and makes plans to send his daughter to college. Immigration worked for him. But it feels different today, as the county of 107,000 people tries to find its footing. The sprawling brick mills that line the river sit mostly shuttered. A quarter of children grow up poor. Taxpayers pick up the welfare tab. So Trump's supporters here tie their embrace of his immigration clampdown to their economic anxieties, and their belief that the newcomers are taking more than they have earned. "There's got to be a point in time when you have to say, 'Whoa, let's get the working people back up. Let's bring the money in. But they keep coming, keep coming," Rodrigue said. His community has been an experiment in immigration and all that comes with it — friendships, fear, triumphs, setbacks — and he knows that Trump's presidency marks another chapter in that struggle for the American soul. "I guess it just boils down to: What's enough? Is that wrong? Am I wrong? Am I bad? That's how I feel." ___ No one invited the Somali refugees to Lewiston. They fled bullets and warlords to eventually be chosen for resettlement in big American cities, where they were unnerved by the crime and drugs and noise. In early 2001, a few refugee families struggling to afford housing in Portland ventured 30 miles north and found a city in retreat. Empty downtown stores were ringed by sagging apartment buildings no longer needed to house workers because so few workers remained. The refugees saw possibility in Lewiston's decay. Word spread quickly, and friends and families followed. The town morphed in a matter of months into a laboratory for what happens when culture suddenly shifts. Maine's population is 94 percent white, and its citizens were abruptly confronted with hundreds of black Muslims, traumatized by war and barely able to speak English. Ardo Mohamed came to Lewiston in 2001. She fled Mogadishu in the 1990s, when militiamen burst into the home she shared with her parents and nine siblings, and started shooting. She watched her father die, as the rest of the family escaped into the woods. They wound up in overcrowded refugee camps, separated for years, then finally Atlanta, then Lewiston. Now she fries sambusas with her sister at a shop she owns downtown. "We wanted to be safe," said the mother of five, "just like you do." When the refugees began arriving, Tabitha Beauchesne was a student at Lewiston High School. Her new classmates were poor, but Beauchesne was poor, too. She grew up in a struggling family in housing projects downtown. It felt to her then, and it still feels to her now, that the refugees got more help than her family. "They just seemed to take over," she said. She doesn't consider herself racist, though acknowledges that race and religion likely play a role in her sense that the refugees overwhelmed her community. The African Muslims, many of whom wear hijabs, stand out far more than her French-Canadian ancestors did when they arrived generations ago, she said. That perception — one of being inundated by a culture so different from her own — ingrained in her a sense of injustice so deep it persists to this day. She's now a stay-at-home mother of two, and she left Lewiston to move to another school district in the county because she believes the refugee students monopolize teachers' attention. Once a Barack Obama supporter, Beauchesne turned to Trump — and she cheers his efforts to curb the flow of refugees into the United States. She wants Trump to design a tax system that funnels less of her money to aiding those from other countries. "I just don't like giving money away that's not benefiting me and, not to sound selfish, but then seeing it benefit other people," she said. "As a business owner, my husband wouldn't donate $500 to the Salvation Army if we couldn't afford it. Our country needs to do the same thing." Taxpayers do help refugee families. Maine offers a welfare program called General Assistance, a combination of state and city funds, which provides impoverished people with vouchers for rent, utilities and food. In 2002, at the beginning of the immigrant influx, the city handed out about $343,000 in General Assistance funds, split almost evenly between native-born Mainers and refugees, according to city records. But rumors, largely unfounded, spread that the refugees were given free cars and apartments. Locals began calling City Hall to demand answers. Then-Mayor Laurier T. Raymond Jr. penned an open letter to the Somali community, asking that they divert friends and family away from a city he described as "maxed-out financially, physically and emotionally." The letter plunged Lewiston overnight into the global political cauldron. A white-supremacist group from out of state planned a rally against the Somali "invasion." Just a few people showed up. But across town 4,000 gathered in a gymnasium to support the Somalis and try to combat the reputation of Lewiston as a racist, xenophobic city that was rocketing around the world. And in that moment, the tide seemed to turn, deputy city administrator Phil Nadeau said. Even more immigrants came. Somali refugees gave way to those seeking asylum, from Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, a dozen nations in all. The immigrant population exploded from a handful of families to more than 7,000 people today, according to a tally by the Immigrant Resource Center of Maine. But the anxieties of old rarely seemed to resurface. Two years ago, immigrant children led the high school soccer team to win the state championship — a moment heralded as a triumph of cultural cooperation. Outside news crews still come from time to time, Nadeau said, and "they're always amazed that there's nothing bad to print." But around the edges of the city, in the suburbs and small towns that fill out the rest of Androscoggin County, many quietly stewed. It's there that Trump's "America First" message took root. ___ Thirty miles up the highway, Joyce Badeau greets customers by name at the hardware store where she works. She lives just outside Livermore Falls, population 3,187 — 3,035 of whom are white. She has little occasion to interact with immigrants, but her political views have been shaped by the idea of them. Badeau voted for Obama but backs Trump now, and points to his promise to rein in immigration as one reason why. "We're becoming a poor country because we're overloaded," she said. "We can't fix the system so long as we keep adding more broken pieces." She has watched the paper mills close and her neighbors lose good-paying jobs. But Badeau isn't naive; she doesn't believe Trump can make the mills roar back to life. That was a bygone era, replaced by email and iPhones. And his arrogance grates on her. But she hopes one day to turn on the news and not hear about crime and homelessness and terrorism — and she worries that someone who wants to hurt Americans might slip through porous borders. Trump promised to fix it all. If he can't, she's not sure what more America can offer immigrants. "Because they're leaving one country of problems and coming into another country of problems," she said. David Lovewell used to work at a paper mill just outside of Livermore Falls that has shed hundreds of jobs. Now he runs a logging company with his sons, but he sees a dim future for them. A few months ago, business got so bad he laid off eight employees and fell behind on his $5,500 monthly payments on the machines he uses to cut down trees. He looked down at his sneakers, bought for $25 at Walmart. There used to be two shoe factories nearby. He wants Trump to stop his town's slow slip toward irrelevancy. Lovewell doesn't like to talk about immigration. He sighs and rubs his head, afraid to seem racist or indifferent to pain and poverty around the world. He went on a cruise to Belize with his wife several years ago, when he still worked at the mill and could afford a vacation. He stopped to buy a carving from an old man whose hands were so worn from years of whittling they looked like leather. He remembers those hands still, and the man's dirt-floor shack with no doors and his skinny, starving dog and the kids riding around on broken bicycles. "I struggled with it, when he did the travel ban," Lovewell said of Trump. "At the same time, I'm seeing ... people losing their jobs. Why are we so worried about immigrants coming into our country when we can't really take care of our own people?" So he's looking to Trump to strike a better balance — to build an economy where his sons don't have to battle to barely get by, and only after that design an immigration system that keeps America's promise of open arms. "I guess it could sound like bigotry," he said. "But we're hurting. Americans are hurting." ___ Politicians have seized on the discontent. Last August, candidate Trump stood on a stage in Portland and singled out the Somali community as causing a crime wave. The Lewiston police chief quickly refuted the charge — crime has decreased dramatically since the refugees arrived — but it stuck in the minds of many. Maine's Republican governor, Paul LePage, has called asylum-seekers "the biggest problem in our state," and suggested they bring danger and disease. And in Androscoggin County, Republican leaders hammer the issue of refugee resettlement on their Facebook page, with post after post about the injustice they see in taxpayers helping them with assistance. They've dubbed it "the refugee racket," and complain that the school system is forced to accommodate 34 languages. Lewiston School Superintendent Bill Webster acknowledges that does cost money. But he has a statistic he likes to share with the critics. Historically, Lewiston has had some of the lowest high school graduation rates in the state. Now, immigrant children are doing better than native-born kids. Some were illiterate in their native language when they set out to learn English. Yet an average of 78.3 percent of immigrant students graduate high school within five years, compared to an average of 73.3 percent of native students. Fifteen years ago, the school district had an enrollment of 4,500 students and falling — a sign of a city on its knees, Webster said. Today, there are 5,400 students, more than one-quarter of them immigrants, and the number is going up. And now the immigrant children who grew up here are going off to college to get degrees, as teachers, doctors, engineers. Several years ago, Webster and his wife sold their home in the suburbs and rented an apartment in downtown Lewiston, across the street from a mosque. They can stroll to dinner, past a yoga studio and a shop that sells artisan olive oil. There are also dozens of immigrant-owned businesses, like the Mogadishu Business Center — with two flags hanging in the window, one American and one Somali. Remaining vacant storefronts have signs in the windows, promising prospective buyers an opportunity to "be part of Lewiston's great rebirth." "We never have the opportunity to redo time under a different set of assumptions," Webster said. "But if the immigrant population hadn't happened, Lewiston would be a community that was contracting, and potentially in a downward death spiral." Organizations that work with immigrants nevertheless must fight on to combat deep-seated distrust. Catholic Charities publishes a fact sheet called "The Top Ten Myths about Somalis and Why They Are Wrong." It lists untruths like, "Somalis are draining the welfare coffers," ''Somalis get free apartments," even "Somalis keep live chickens in their kitchen cupboards." Maine's immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa made $136.6 million in income in 2014, and paid $40 million in taxes, according to one report from a bipartisan think-tank. But they largely work in invisible jobs, said Catherine Besteman, a professor of anthropology at Maine's Colby College. They take out trash at hotels, do the laundry at the hospital. People don't see them working, she said, so when they see them driving a car, or shopping for groceries, it becomes easy to assume they got it for free. That leaves some here still feeling that the immigrants take more than they deserve. Tabitha Beauchesne pulled a bag of bargain-brand cereal out of her kitchen cabinet to demonstrate that point. At the grocery store, she said, she sees immigrant mothers with carts piled high with name-brand food. "I guess I'm jealous of that. I would love to buy my kids the real Fruit Roll-Ups," she said. "But, no, sorry kids, you get the fruit packets from Walmart." ___ So Mohamed Ibrahim now knocks on doors. "Hello," he says to strangers across Androscoggin County. "I am a Muslim. I was welcomed by America. I was helped by General Assistance, and that was coming from your pockets and I am grateful. I became a taxpayer. I'm not taking anything. Now I am giving." He wants his neighbors to know him, to know that he is normal. Trump's election here taught him he has a lot more work to do. "We thought, 'Yay, it's perfect.' But everything was slipping." Ibrahim came in 2012 from Djibouti, where he risked imprisonment for opposing his government. He is one of the thousands who have flooded into Lewiston in recent years because they are seeking asylum from oppression. With them came a spike in the amount of taxpayer assistance going to immigrants. Asylum-seekers, unlike resettled refugees, are barred from getting work permits for at least six months and many, like Ibrahim, must rely on government assistance to get by when they first arrive. The amount paid to immigrants jumped recently to nearly a half-million dollars. And there seems to be more tension in town since Trump took office. One woman reported she was nearly run down by a screaming driver; another said someone jerked her hijab and told her to go back where she came from. Ardo Mohamed, the Somali who cooks sambusas with her sister, is an American citizen now. Her children were born in the United States. But they worry the government will come to send her away. "We are scared," she said. "They say every night, 'Mom, if they take you, where we do live?'" Ibrahim does not blame his neighbors for supporting Trump, because he's seen the pull of populism before. When his friends complain about the policies on immigration, he reminds them of the day, more than a decade ago, that the interior minister of their country ordered all illegal immigrants to leave or face mass arrest. He asks them how they felt, and they respond: patriotic - like their government was looking out for them. Ibrahim has his own hopes for the president. He hopes Trump will build an immigration system that gives people confidence that those coming are good and hardworking - so that, one day, people like him will be called Americans, not refugees. But he worries it will come at a cost. In 50 years, he thinks, the descendants of his fellow African immigrants will be suspicious of whoever comes next. "That's how it's been through history. The Irish were discriminated against, and then they discriminated against the French. The French were discriminated against, now they discriminate against us, at the bottom of the ladder," he said, laughing uncomfortably. "I don't hope for that, it is not my wish. We can change. But still, we are stuck being human beings." ___ AP data journalist Angeliki Kastanis contributed to this report.

A few months ago, business got so bad he laid off eight employees and fell behind on his $5,500 monthly payments on the machines he uses to cut down trees. He looked down at his sneakers, bought for $25 at Walmart. There used to be two shoe factories nearby. He wants Trump to stop his town’s slow slip toward irrelevancy. Lovewell doesn’t like to talk about immigration. He sighs and rubs his head, afraid to seem racist or indifferent to pain and poverty around the world. He went on a cruise to Belize with his wife several years ago, when he still worked at the mill and could afford a vacation. He stopped to buy a carving from an old man whose hands were so worn from years of whittling they looked like leather. He remembers those hands still, and the man’s dirt-floor shack with no doors and his skinny, starving dog and the kids riding around on broken bicycles. “I struggled with it, when he did the travel ban,” Lovewell said of Trump. “At the same time, I’m seeing … people losing their jobs. Why are we so worried about immigrants coming into our country when we can’t really take care of our own people?” So he’s looking to Trump to strike a better balance — to build an economy where his sons don’t have to battle to barely get by, and only after that design an immigration system that keeps America’s promise of open arms. “I guess it could sound like bigotry,” he said. “But we’re hurting. Americans are hurting.” ___ Politicians have seized on the discontent. Last August, candidate Trump stood on a stage in Portland and singled out the Somali community as causing a crime wave. The Lewiston police chief quickly refuted the charge — crime has decreased dramatically since the refugees arrived — but it stuck in the minds of many. Maine’s Republican governor, Paul LePage, has called asylum-seekers “the biggest problem in our state,” and suggested they bring danger and disease. And in Androscoggin County, Republican leaders hammer the issue of refugee resettlement on their Facebook page, with post after post about the injustice they see in taxpayers helping them with assistance. They’ve dubbed it “the refugee racket,” and complain that the school system is forced to accommodate 34 languages. Lewiston School Superintendent Bill Webster acknowledges that does cost money. But he has a statistic he likes to share with the critics. Historically, Lewiston has had some of the lowest high school graduation rates in the state. Now, immigrant children are doing better than native-born kids. Some were illiterate in their native language when they set out to learn English. Yet an average of 78.3 percent of immigrant students graduate high school within five years, compared to an average of 73.3 percent of native students. Fifteen years ago, the school district had an enrollment of 4,500 students and falling — a sign of a city on its knees, Webster said. Today, there are 5,400 students, more than one-quarter of them immigrants, and the number is going up. And now the immigrant children who grew up here are going off to college to get degrees, as teachers, doctors, engineers. Several years ago, Webster and his wife sold their home in the suburbs and rented an apartment in downtown Lewiston, across the street from a mosque. They can stroll to dinner, past a yoga studio and a shop that sells artisan olive oil. There are also dozens of immigrant-owned businesses, like the Mogadishu Business Center — with two flags hanging in the window, one American and one Somali. Remaining vacant storefronts have signs in the windows, promising prospective buyers an opportunity to “be part of Lewiston’s great rebirth.” “We never have the opportunity to redo time under a different set of assumptions,” Webster said. “But if the immigrant population hadn’t happened, Lewiston would be a community that was contracting, and potentially in a downward death spiral.” Organizations that work with immigrants nevertheless must fight on to combat deep-seated distrust. Catholic Charities publishes a fact sheet called “The Top Ten Myths about Somalis and Why They Are Wrong.” It lists untruths like, “Somalis are draining the welfare coffers,” ”Somalis get free apartments,” even “Somalis keep live chickens in their kitchen cupboards.” Maine’s immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa made $136.6 million in income in 2014, and paid $40 million in taxes, according to one report from a bipartisan think-tank. But they largely work in invisible jobs, said Catherine Besteman, a professor of anthropology at Maine’s Colby College. They take out trash at hotels, do the laundry at the hospital. People don’t see them working, she said, so when they see them driving a car, or shopping for groceries, it becomes easy to assume they got it for free. That leaves some here still feeling that the immigrants take more than they deserve. Tabitha Beauchesne pulled a bag of bargain-brand cereal out of her kitchen cabinet to demonstrate that point. At the grocery store, she said, she sees immigrant mothers with carts piled high with name-brand food. “I guess I’m jealous of that. I would love to buy my kids the real Fruit Roll-Ups,” she said. “But, no, sorry kids, you get the fruit packets from Walmart.” ___ So Mohamed Ibrahim now knocks on doors. “Hello,” he says to strangers across Androscoggin County. “I am a Muslim. I was welcomed by America. I was helped by General Assistance, and that was coming from your pockets and I am grateful. I became a taxpayer. I’m not taking anything. Now I am giving.” He wants his neighbors to know him, to know that he is normal. Trump’s election here taught him he has a lot more work to do. “We thought, ‘Yay, it’s perfect.’ But everything was slipping.” Ibrahim came in 2012 from Djibouti, where he risked imprisonment for opposing his government. He is one of the thousands who have flooded into Lewiston in recent years because they are seeking asylum from oppression. With them came a spike in the amount of taxpayer assistance going to immigrants. Asylum-seekers, unlike resettled refugees, are barred from getting work permits for at least six months and many, like Ibrahim, must rely on government assistance to get by when they first arrive. The amount paid to immigrants jumped recently to nearly a half-million dollars. And there seems to be more tension in town since Trump took office. One woman reported she was nearly run down by a screaming driver; another said someone jerked her hijab and told her to go back where she came from. Ardo Mohamed, the Somali who cooks sambusas with her sister, is an American citizen now. Her children were born in the United States. But they worry the government will come to send her away. “We are scared,” she said. “They say every night, ‘Mom, if they take you, where we do live?'” Ibrahim does not blame his neighbors for supporting Trump, because he’s seen the pull of populism before. When his friends complain about the policies on immigration, he reminds them of the day, more than a decade ago, that the interior minister of their country ordered all illegal immigrants to leave or face mass arrest. He asks them how they felt, and they respond: patriotic – like their government was looking out for them. Ibrahim has his own hopes for the president. He hopes Trump will build an immigration system that gives people confidence that those coming are good and hardworking – so that, one day, people like him will be called Americans, not refugees. But he worries it will come at a cost. In 50 years, he thinks, the descendants of his fellow African immigrants will be suspicious of whoever comes next. “That’s how it’s been through history. The Irish were discriminated against, and then they discriminated against the French. The French were discriminated against, now they discriminate against us, at the bottom of the ladder,” he said, laughing uncomfortably. “I don’t hope for that, it is not my wish. We can change. But still, we are stuck being human beings.” ___ AP data journalist Angeliki Kastanis contributed to this report. ___ Read more of AP’s coverage of Americans looking to Trump for change: http://tinyurl.com/n7a2hvl Topics: All News Business News Government News Sports News Leave A Comment Home » The Associated Press » Sports News » How a community changed… Partners FEDERAL INSIGHTS The Associated Press Government News U.S. News Business News World News Technology News Entertainment News Sports News Today in History 1775: The Ride of Paul Revere Fed Photo of the Day Massachusetts National Guard and reenactors honor American Revolution Top Stories Public officials with ‘no idea what it means to serve’ main culprit behind low DHS morale, Kelly says Top Story New Trump order takes aim at federal procurement rules Acquisition Policy Lawmakers have a unique role to play in government reorganization Congress Feds worried restructuring will go the way of past attempts to reorganize Exclusive DoD in process of splitting responsibilities for two new acquisition offices Acquisition Policy THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN TICKER Apr 18, 2017 Close Change YTD L Income 18.7263 -0.0091 1.73% L 2020 25.1393 -0.0305 2.91% L 2030 27.8257 -0.0574 4.13% L 2040 29.8682 -0.0732 4.73% L 2050 17.0773 -0.0486 5.28% G Fund 15.2941 0.0010 0.59% F Fund 17.8288 0.0650 0.93% C Fund 32.4907 -0.0937 6.07% S Fund 42.4020 -0.0009 4.57% I Fund 26.1804 -0.1862 7.35% Closing price updated at approx 6pm EST. each business day.

(AP Photo/David Goldman) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... LEWISTON, Maine — Richard Rodrigue stood in the back of a banquet hall, watching his blond-haired, blue-eyed daughter mingle among her high school classmates. These teenagers speak dozens of languages, and hail from a dozen African nations. They fled brutal civil war, famine, oppressive regimes to find themselves here, at an ordinary high school pre-prom fete in this once-dying New England mill town, revived by an influx of some 7,500 immigrants over the last 16 years. Rodrigue smiled and waved at his daughter, proud she is a part of it: “It will help her in life,” he said. “The world is not all white.” Rodrigue believes the refugees resuscitated his town — plugging the population drain that had threatened to cripple it, opening shops and restaurants in boarded-up storefronts. But he also agrees with Donald Trump that there should be no more of them, at least not now. America is struggling, he says, and needs to take care of its own before it takes care of anyone else. Advertisement Continue reading His working-class community, built along the banks of the Androscoggin River in the whitest state in America, is a place that some point to as proof that refugee integration can work. And yet for the first time in 30 years, voters in Androscoggin County chose a Republican for president, endorsing Trump’s nativist zeal against the very sort of immigrants who share their streets and their schools. Rodrigue knows he was born on the winning end of the American dream. His grandfather fled poverty in Quebec and moved to Maine to toil his whole life in the textile mills. He never learned English, faced hate and discrimination. Two generations later, Rodrigue owns a successful security company, lives in a tidy house in a quiet neighborhood and makes plans to send his daughter to college. Immigration worked for him. But it feels different today, as the county of 107,000 people tries to find its footing. The sprawling brick mills that line the river sit mostly shuttered. A quarter of children grow up poor. Taxpayers pick up the welfare tab. So Trump’s supporters here tie their embrace of his immigration clampdown to their economic anxieties, and their belief that the newcomers are taking more than they have earned. “There’s got to be a point in time when you have to say, ‘Whoa, let’s get the working people back up. Let’s bring the money in. But they keep coming, keep coming,” Rodrigue said. His community has been an experiment in immigration and all that comes with it — friendships, fear, triumphs, setbacks — and he knows that Trump’s presidency marks another chapter in that struggle for the American soul. “I guess it just boils down to: What’s enough? Is that wrong? Am I wrong? Am I bad? That’s how I feel.” ___ A woman carries goods on her back after shopping at one of the many stores downtown owned by African refugees who have settled in Lewiston, Maine, Wednesday, March 15, 2017. Maine offers a welfare program called General Assistance, which provides impoverished people with vouchers for rent, utilities and food. The amount refugees has bounced up and down over the years, but it accounts for less than 1 percent of the budget, said deputy city administrator Phil Nadeau. (AP Photo/David Goldman) No one invited the Somali refugees to Lewiston. Advertisement Continue reading They fled bullets and warlords to eventually be chosen for resettlement in big American cities, where they were unnerved by the crime and drugs and noise. In early 2001, a few refugee families struggling to afford housing in Portland ventured 30 miles north and found a city in retreat. Empty downtown stores were ringed by sagging apartment buildings no longer needed to house workers because so few workers remained. The refugees saw possibility in Lewiston’s decay. Word spread quickly, and friends and families followed. The town morphed in a matter of months into a laboratory for what happens when culture suddenly shifts. Maine’s population is 94 percent white, and its citizens were abruptly confronted with hundreds of black Muslims, traumatized by war and barely able to speak English. Ardo Mohamed came to Lewiston in 2001. She fled Mogadishu in the 1990s, when militiamen burst into the home she shared with her parents and nine siblings, and started shooting. She watched her father die, as the rest of the family escaped into the woods. They wound up in overcrowded refugee camps, separated for years, then finally Atlanta, then Lewiston. Now she fries sambusas with her sister at a shop she owns downtown. “We wanted to be safe,” said the mother of five, “just like you do.” Victoria Schalk, 22, left, and Melinda Blais, 27, right, share a traditional Somali meal with college classmate Nasteho Issa, 21, at restaurant and market opened by one of the first Somali families who settled in 2001 in Lewiston, Maine, Wednesday, March 15, 2017. The population had plummeted in 2001 as the paper mills closed. Downtown storefronts sat boarded up, ringed by sagging apartment buildings no longer needed to house workers since so few remained. The refugees saw possibility in Lewiston’s decay. Word spread quickly and friends and families followed, by the hundreds. The town morphed in a matter of months into a laboratory for what happens when demographics and culture suddenly shift. (AP Photo/David Goldman) When the refugees began arriving, Tabitha Beauchesne was a student at Lewiston High School. Her new classmates were poor, but Beauchesne was poor, too. She grew up in a struggling family in housing projects downtown. It felt to her then, and it still feels to her now, that the refugees got more help than her family. “They just seemed to take over,” she said. She doesn’t consider herself racist, though acknowledges that race and religion likely play a role in her sense that the refugees overwhelmed her community. The African Muslims, many of whom wear hijabs, stand out far more than her French-Canadian ancestors did when they arrived generations ago, she said. That perception — one of being inundated by a culture so different from her own — ingrained in her a sense of injustice so deep it persists to this day. She’s now a stay-at-home mother of two, and she left Lewiston to move to another school district in the county because she believes the refugee students monopolize teachers’ attention. Once a Barack Obama supporter, Beauchesne turned to Trump — and she cheers his efforts to curb the flow of refugees into the United States. She wants Trump to design a tax system that funnels less of her money to aiding those from other countries. “I just don’t like giving money away that’s not benefiting me and, not to sound selfish, but then seeing it benefit other people,” she said. “As a business owner, my husband wouldn’t donate $500 to the Salvation Army if we couldn’t afford it. Our country needs to do the same thing.” Taxpayers do help refugee families. Maine offers a welfare program called General Assistance, a combination of state and city funds, which provides impoverished people with vouchers for rent, utilities and food. In 2002, at the beginning of the immigrant influx, the city handed out about $343,000 in General Assistance funds, split almost evenly between native-born Mainers and refugees, according to city records. But rumors, largely unfounded, spread that the refugees were given free cars and apartments. Locals began calling City Hall to demand answers. Then-Mayor Laurier T. Raymond Jr. penned an open letter to the Somali community, asking that they divert friends and family away from a city he described as “maxed-out financially, physically and emotionally.” The letter plunged Lewiston overnight into the global political cauldron. A white-supremacist group from out of state planned a rally against the Somali “invasion.” Just a few people showed up. But across town 4,000 gathered in a gymnasium to support the Somalis and try to combat the reputation of Lewiston as a racist, xenophobic city that was rocketing around the world. U.S. flags hang outside a downtown building whose storefronts are made up of businesses started by African immigrants who have settled in Lewiston, Maine, Friday, March 17, 2017. Maine’s immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa made $136.6 million in income in 2014, and paid $40 million in taxes, according to a report from the New American Economy, a bi-partisan coalition pushing for immigration reform. (AP Photo/David Goldman) And in that moment, the tide seemed to turn, deputy city administrator Phil Nadeau said. Even more immigrants came. Somali refugees gave way to those seeking asylum, from Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, a dozen nations in all. The immigrant population exploded from a handful of families to more than 7,000 people today, according to a tally by the Immigrant Resource Center of Maine. But the anxieties of old rarely seemed to resurface. Two years ago, immigrant children led the high school soccer team to win the state championship — a moment heralded as a triumph of cultural cooperation. Outside news crews still come from time to time, Nadeau said, and “they’re always amazed that there’s nothing bad to print.” But around the edges of the city, in the suburbs and small towns that fill out the rest of Androscoggin County, many quietly stewed. It’s there that Trump’s “America First” message took root. ___ Trump supporter Stephanie Rodrigue, 17, picks up one of the campaign signs she’s collected in her room in Lewiston, Maine, Thursday, March 16, 2017. Although too young to vote, Rodrigue supported Trump, so much she bellowed his name at pep rallies, affixed a campaign sticker to her laptop and came to be called by her classmates “the mini-Trump.” (AP Photo/David Goldman) Thirty miles up the highway, Joyce Badeau greets customers by name at the hardware store where she works. She lives just outside Livermore Falls, population 3,187 — 3,035 of whom are white. She has little occasion to interact with immigrants, but her political views have been shaped by the idea of them. Badeau voted for Obama but backs Trump now, and points to his promise to rein in immigration as one reason why. “We’re becoming a poor country because we’re overloaded,” she said. “We can’t fix the system so long as we keep adding more broken pieces.” She has watched the paper mills close and her neighbors lose good-paying jobs. But Badeau isn’t naive; she doesn’t believe Trump can make the mills roar back to life. That was a bygone era, replaced by email and iPhones. And his arrogance grates on her. But she hopes one day to turn on the news and not hear about crime and homelessness and terrorism — and she worries that someone who wants to hurt Americans might slip through porous borders. Trump promised to fix it all. If he can’t, she’s not sure what more America can offer immigrants. “Because they’re leaving one country of problems and coming into another country of problems,” she said. David Lovewell used to work at a paper mill just outside of Livermore Falls that has shed hundreds of jobs. Now he runs a logging company with his sons, but he sees a dim future for them. A few months ago, business got so bad he laid off eight employees and fell behind on his $5,500 monthly payments on the machines he uses to cut down trees.

Why are we so worried about immigrants coming into our country when we can’t really take care of our own people?” Lewiston city council member Tim Lajoie is reflected in a frame displaying American Revolution paraphernalia as he looks out his window at his home in Lewiston, Maine, Tuesday, March 14, 2017. “The mills moved out in the 80s and we’ve had this struggle to recover economically,” said Lajoie, who voted for Donald Trump. “We’re trying to find our footing I think. Trying to find out what we look like, what’s our identity.” (AP Photo/David Goldman) So he’s looking to Trump to strike a better balance — to build an economy where his sons don’t have to battle to barely get by, and only after that design an immigration system that keeps America’s promise of open arms. “I guess it could sound like bigotry,” he said. “But we’re hurting.

That leaves some here still feeling that the immigrants take more than they deserve. Tabitha Beauchesne stands in her living room as photos of her husband and two children hang on the wall in her home in Auburn, Maine, Thursday, March 16, 2017. Beauchesne moved to Auburn, a city right across the river, because she believed that the refugee students at Lewiston schools take teachers’ attention away from native-born kids. She voted twice for Barack Obama. Then she voted for Donald Trump, because she hopes his pledge to put America first means immigration into her hometown will stop, or at least slow down. (AP Photo/David Goldman) Tabitha Beauchesne pulled a bag of bargain-brand cereal out of her kitchen cabinet to demonstrate that point. At the grocery store, she said, she sees immigrant mothers with carts piled high with name-brand food. “I guess I’m jealous of that. I would love to buy my kids the real Fruit Roll-Ups,” she said. “But, no, sorry kids, you get the fruit packets from Walmart.” ___ So Mohamed Ibrahim now knocks on doors. “Hello,” he says to strangers across Androscoggin County. “I am a Muslim. I was welcomed by America. I was helped by General Assistance, and that was coming from your pockets and I am grateful. I became a taxpayer. I’m not taking anything. Now I am giving.” He wants his neighbors to know him, to know that he is normal. Trump’s election here taught him he has a lot more work to do. “We thought, ‘Yay, it’s perfect.’ But everything was slipping.” Ibrahim came in 2012 from Djibouti, where he risked imprisonment for opposing his government.

Asylum-seekers, unlike resettled refugees, are barred from getting work permits for at least six months and many, like Ibrahim, must rely on government assistance to get by when they first arrive. The amount paid to immigrants jumped recently to nearly a half-million dollars. And there seems to be more tension in town since Trump took office. One woman reported she was nearly run down by a screaming driver; another said someone jerked her hijab and told her to go back where she came from. A worshipper takes his shoes off before entering the Lewiston Auburn Islamic Center for prayers in Lewiston, Maine, Friday, March 17, 2017. Hillary Clinton won the election within the city of Lewiston, though by less than 1,000 votes, a far narrower margin than President Barack Obama. It was in the rural communities circling the city, among voters who do not interact daily with the refugees, where Donald Trump got enough support to flip Androscoggin County red. (AP Photo/David Goldman) Ardo Mohamed, the Somali who cooks sambusas with her sister, is an American citizen now. Her children were born in the United States. But they worry the government will come to send her away. “We are scared,” she said. “They say every night, ‘Mom, if they take you, where we do live?'” Ibrahim does not blame his neighbors for supporting Trump, because he’s seen the pull of populism before.

These teenagers speak dozens of languages, and hail from a dozen African nations. They fled brutal civil war, famine, oppressive regimes to find themselves here, at an ordinary high school pre-prom fete in this once-dying New England mill town, revived by an influx of some 7,500 immigrants over the last 16 years. Rodrigue smiled and waved at his daughter, proud she is a part of it: "It will help her in life," he said. "The world is not all white." Rodrigue believes the refugees resuscitated his town — plugging the population drain that had threatened to cripple it, opening shops and restaurants in boarded-up storefronts. But he also agrees with Donald Trump that there should be no more of them, at least not now. America is struggling, he says, and needs to take care of its own before it takes care of anyone else. His working-class community, built along the banks of the Androscoggin River in the whitest state in America, is a place that some point to as proof that refugee integration can work. And yet for the first time in 30 years, voters in Androscoggin County chose a Republican for president, endorsing Trump's nativist zeal against the very sort of immigrants who share their streets and their schools. Rodrigue knows he was born on the winning end of the American dream. His grandfather fled poverty in Quebec and moved to Maine to toil his whole life in the textile mills. He never learned English, faced hate and discrimination. Two generations later, Rodrigue owns a successful security company, lives in a tidy house in a quiet neighborhood and makes plans to send his daughter to college. Immigration worked for him. But it feels different today, as the county of 107,000 people tries to find its footing. The sprawling brick mills that line the river sit mostly shuttered. A quarter of children grow up poor. Taxpayers pick up the welfare tab. So Trump's supporters here tie their embrace of his immigration clampdown to their economic anxieties, and their belief that the newcomers are taking more than they have earned. "There's got to be a point in time when you have to say, 'Whoa, let's get the working people back up. Let's bring the money in. But they keep coming, keep coming," Rodrigue said. His community has been an experiment in immigration and all that comes with it — friendships, fear, triumphs, setbacks — and he knows that Trump's presidency marks another chapter in that struggle for the American soul. "I guess it just boils down to: What's enough? Is that wrong? Am I wrong? Am I bad? That's how I feel." ___ No one invited the Somali refugees to Lewiston. They fled bullets and warlords to eventually be chosen for resettlement in big American cities, where they were unnerved by the crime and drugs and noise. In early 2001, a few refugee families struggling to afford housing in Portland ventured 30 miles north and found a city in retreat. Empty downtown stores were ringed by sagging apartment buildings no longer needed to house workers because so few workers remained. The refugees saw possibility in Lewiston's decay. Word spread quickly, and friends and families followed. The town morphed in a matter of months into a laboratory for what happens when culture suddenly shifts. Maine's population is 94 percent white, and its citizens were abruptly confronted with hundreds of black Muslims, traumatized by war and barely able to speak English. Ardo Mohamed came to Lewiston in 2001. She fled Mogadishu in the 1990s, when militiamen burst into the home she shared with her parents and nine siblings, and started shooting. She watched her father die, as the rest of the family escaped into the woods. They wound up in overcrowded refugee camps, separated for years, then finally Atlanta, then Lewiston. Now she fries sambusas with her sister at a shop she owns downtown. "We wanted to be safe," said the mother of five, "just like you do." When the refugees began arriving, Tabitha Beauchesne was a student at Lewiston High School. Her new classmates were poor, but Beauchesne was poor, too. She grew up in a struggling family in housing projects downtown. It felt to her then, and it still feels to her now, that the refugees got more help than her family. "They just seemed to take over," she said. She doesn't consider herself racist, though acknowledges that race and religion likely play a role in her sense that the refugees overwhelmed her community. The African Muslims, many of whom wear hijabs, stand out far more than her French-Canadian ancestors did when they arrived generations ago, she said. That perception — one of being inundated by a culture so different from her own — ingrained in her a sense of injustice so deep it persists to this day. She's now a stay-at-home mother of two, and she left Lewiston to move to another school district in the county because she believes the refugee students monopolize teachers' attention. Once a Barack Obama supporter, Beauchesne turned to Trump — and she cheers his efforts to curb the flow of refugees into the United States. She wants Trump to design a tax system that funnels less of her money to aiding those from other countries. "I just don't like giving money away that's not benefiting me and, not to sound selfish, but then seeing it benefit other people," she said. "As a business owner, my husband wouldn't donate $500 to the Salvation Army if we couldn't afford it. Our country needs to do the same thing." Taxpayers do help refugee families. Maine offers a welfare program called General Assistance, a combination of state and city funds, which provides impoverished people with vouchers for rent, utilities and food. In 2002, at the beginning of the immigrant influx, the city handed out about $343,000 in General Assistance funds, split almost evenly between native-born Mainers and refugees, according to city records. But rumors, largely unfounded, spread that the refugees were given free cars and apartments. Locals began calling City Hall to demand answers. Then-Mayor Laurier T. Raymond Jr. penned an open letter to the Somali community, asking that they divert friends and family away from a city he described as "maxed-out financially, physically and emotionally." The letter plunged Lewiston overnight into the global political cauldron. A white-supremacist group from out of state planned a rally against the Somali "invasion." Just a few people showed up. But across town 4,000 gathered in a gymnasium to support the Somalis and try to combat the reputation of Lewiston as a racist, xenophobic city that was rocketing around the world. And in that moment, the tide seemed to turn, deputy city administrator Phil Nadeau said. Even more immigrants came. Somali refugees gave way to those seeking asylum, from Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, a dozen nations in all. The immigrant population exploded from a handful of families to more than 7,000 people today, according to a tally by the Immigrant Resource Center of Maine. But the anxieties of old rarely seemed to resurface. Two years ago, immigrant children led the high school soccer team to win the state championship — a moment heralded as a triumph of cultural cooperation. Outside news crews still come from time to time, Nadeau said, and "they're always amazed that there's nothing bad to print." But around the edges of the city, in the suburbs and small towns that fill out the rest of Androscoggin County, many quietly stewed. It's there that Trump's "America First" message took root. ___ Thirty miles up the highway, Joyce Badeau greets customers by name at the hardware store where she works. She lives just outside Livermore Falls, population 3,187 — 3,035 of whom are white. She has little occasion to interact with immigrants, but her political views have been shaped by the idea of them. Badeau voted for Obama but backs Trump now, and points to his promise to rein in immigration as one reason why. "We're becoming a poor country because we're overloaded," she said. "We can't fix the system so long as we keep adding more broken pieces." She has watched the paper mills close and her neighbors lose good-paying jobs. But Badeau isn't naive; she doesn't believe Trump can make the mills roar back to life. That was a bygone era, replaced by email and iPhones. And his arrogance grates on her. But she hopes one day to turn on the news and not hear about crime and homelessness and terrorism — and she worries that someone who wants to hurt Americans might slip through porous borders. Trump promised to fix it all. If he can't, she's not sure what more America can offer immigrants. "Because they're leaving one country of problems and coming into another country of problems," she said. David Lovewell used to work at a paper mill just outside of Livermore Falls that has shed hundreds of jobs. Now he runs a logging company with his sons, but he sees a dim future for them. A few months ago, business got so bad he laid off eight employees and fell behind on his $5,500 monthly payments on the machines he uses to cut down trees. He looked down at his sneakers, bought for $25 at Walmart. There used to be two shoe factories nearby. He wants Trump to stop his town's slow slip toward irrelevancy. Lovewell doesn't like to talk about immigration. He sighs and rubs his head, afraid to seem racist or indifferent to pain and poverty around the world. He went on a cruise to Belize with his wife several years ago, when he still worked at the mill and could afford a vacation. He stopped to buy a carving from an old man whose hands were so worn from years of whittling they looked like leather. He remembers those hands still, and the man's dirt-floor shack with no doors and his skinny, starving dog and the kids riding around on broken bicycles. "I struggled with it, when he did the travel ban," Lovewell said of Trump. "At the same time, I'm seeing ... people losing their jobs. Why are we so worried about immigrants coming into our country when we can't really take care of our own people?" So he's looking to Trump to strike a better balance — to build an economy where his sons don't have to battle to barely get by, and only after that design an immigration system that keeps America's promise of open arms. "I guess it could sound like bigotry," he said. "But we're hurting. Americans are hurting." ___ Politicians have seized on the discontent. Last August, candidate Trump stood on a stage in Portland and singled out the Somali community as causing a crime wave. The Lewiston police chief quickly refuted the charge — crime has decreased dramatically since the refugees arrived — but it stuck in the minds of many. Maine's Republican governor, Paul LePage, has called asylum-seekers "the biggest problem in our state," and suggested they bring danger and disease. And in Androscoggin County, Republican leaders hammer the issue of refugee resettlement on their Facebook page, with post after post about the injustice they see in taxpayers helping them with assistance. They've dubbed it "the refugee racket," and complain that the school system is forced to accommodate 34 languages. Lewiston School Superintendent Bill Webster acknowledges that does cost money. But he has a statistic he likes to share with the critics. Historically, Lewiston has had some of the lowest high school graduation rates in the state. Now, immigrant children are doing better than native-born kids. Some were illiterate in their native language when they set out to learn English. Yet an average of 78.3 percent of immigrant students graduate high school within five years, compared to an average of 73.3 percent of native students. Fifteen years ago, the school district had an enrollment of 4,500 students and falling — a sign of a city on its knees, Webster said. Today, there are 5,400 students, more than one-quarter of them immigrants, and the number is going up. And now the immigrant children who grew up here are going off to college to get degrees, as teachers, doctors, engineers. Several years ago, Webster and his wife sold their home in the suburbs and rented an apartment in downtown Lewiston, across the street from a mosque. They can stroll to dinner, past a yoga studio and a shop that sells artisan olive oil. There are also dozens of immigrant-owned businesses, like the Mogadishu Business Center — with two flags hanging in the window, one American and one Somali. Remaining vacant storefronts have signs in the windows, promising prospective buyers an opportunity to "be part of Lewiston's great rebirth." "We never have the opportunity to redo time under a different set of assumptions," Webster said. "But if the immigrant population hadn't happened, Lewiston would be a community that was contracting, and potentially in a downward death spiral." Organizations that work with immigrants nevertheless must fight on to combat deep-seated distrust. Catholic Charities publishes a fact sheet called "The Top Ten Myths about Somalis and Why They Are Wrong." It lists untruths like, "Somalis are draining the welfare coffers," ''Somalis get free apartments," even "Somalis keep live chickens in their kitchen cupboards." Maine's immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa made $136.6 million in income in 2014, and paid $40 million in taxes, according to one report from a bipartisan think-tank. But they largely work in invisible jobs, said Catherine Besteman, a professor of anthropology at Maine's Colby College. They take out trash at hotels, do the laundry at the hospital. People don't see them working, she said, so when they see them driving a car, or shopping for groceries, it becomes easy to assume they got it for free. That leaves some here still feeling that the immigrants take more than they deserve. Tabitha Beauchesne pulled a bag of bargain-brand cereal out of her kitchen cabinet to demonstrate that point. At the grocery store, she said, she sees immigrant mothers with carts piled high with name-brand food. "I guess I'm jealous of that. I would love to buy my kids the real Fruit Roll-Ups," she said. "But, no, sorry kids, you get the fruit packets from Walmart." ___ So Mohamed Ibrahim now knocks on doors. "Hello," he says to strangers across Androscoggin County. "I am a Muslim. I was welcomed by America. I was helped by General Assistance, and that was coming from your pockets and I am grateful. I became a taxpayer. I'm not taking anything. Now I am giving." He wants his neighbors to know him, to know that he is normal. Trump's election here taught him he has a lot more work to do. "We thought, 'Yay, it's perfect.' But everything was slipping." Ibrahim came in 2012 from Djibouti, where he risked imprisonment for opposing his government. He is one of the thousands who have flooded into Lewiston in recent years because they are seeking asylum from oppression. With them came a spike in the amount of taxpayer assistance going to immigrants. Asylum-seekers, unlike resettled refugees, are barred from getting work permits for at least six months and many, like Ibrahim, must rely on government assistance to get by when they first arrive. The amount paid to immigrants jumped recently to nearly a half-million dollars. And there seems to be more tension in town since Trump took office. One woman reported she was nearly run down by a screaming driver; another said someone jerked her hijab and told her to go back where she came from. Ardo Mohamed, the Somali who cooks sambusas with her sister, is an American citizen now. Her children were born in the United States. But they worry the government will come to send her away. "We are scared," she said. "They say every night, 'Mom, if they take you, where we do live?'" Ibrahim does not blame his neighbors for supporting Trump, because he's seen the pull of populism before. When his friends complain about the policies on immigration, he reminds them of the day, more than a decade ago, that the interior minister of their country ordered all illegal immigrants to leave or face mass arrest. He asks them how they felt, and they respond: patriotic - like their government was looking out for them. Ibrahim has his own hopes for the president. He hopes Trump will build an immigration system that gives people confidence that those coming are good and hardworking - so that, one day, people like him will be called Americans, not refugees. But he worries it will come at a cost. In 50 years, he thinks, the descendants of his fellow African immigrants will be suspicious of whoever comes next. "That's how it's been through history. The Irish were discriminated against, and then they discriminated against the French. The French were discriminated against, now they discriminate against us, at the bottom of the ladder," he said, laughing uncomfortably. "I don't hope for that, it is not my wish. We can change. But still, we are stuck being human beings."

It was early Sunday, and Air Force One was parked on the other side of PBIA, and pretty soon the crash had brought in not just Palm Beach County Sheriff’s deputies but also the Secret Service, frantically searching for a possible threat to the President of the United States — a threat authorities soon determined didn’t exist, according to a report. Bryan E. Hewey-Garcia, 24, fled the crash site, then called in a fake carjacking, the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s alleges. Hewey-Garcia was booked Sunday morning into the Palm Beach County Jail, charged with DUI, filing a false crime report, and leaving the scene of a crash. He later was released on his own supervision, records show. Hewey-Garcia had no comment, his mother said Monday. His father also declined to comment. According to a Palm Beach County Sheriff’s report, around 2 a.m. Sunday, Hewey-Garcia lost control as he drove west on Belvedere Road where it jogs around PBIA’s northwest runway, a short distance east of Military Trail and just across from the Wal-Mart. The report said the vehicle — a 2005 Mercury — was found angled on an embankment about 300 feet south of the security fence. Deputies traced its path and determined it missed the curve, came up on the sidewalk, and tore through the fencing. Arriving deputies found a woman still in the car and being treated by county Fire-Rescue paramedics. She identified Hewey-Garcia as the driver but didn’t know where he was, the report said. Around 2:30 a.m., the report said, Hewey-Garcia called 911 to say he was at the Wal-Mart and that, a short time earlier, he’d been carjacked. Because President Donald Trump was spending the weekend at the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, and Air Force One was parked on the south side of the airport, deputies alerted the Secret Service, the report said. When a deputy arrived at Wal-Mart, the report continued, Hewey-Garcia — who said he’d hurt his ankle — had bloodshot eyes and breath smelling of alcohol. He told the deputy he’d been stopped around Belvedere Road and Australian Avenue, near the airport’s east entrance, when a man who was unarmed but acting aggressive had ordered him and his girlfriend out of the car, then fled in it. After Hewey-Garcia signed a stolen car affidavit, the deputy said he knew there’d been no carjacking and that Hewey-Garcia had crashed his car and fled. A witness who said he watched the vehicle leave the road also had identified Hewey-Garcia as the driver, the report said. It said Hewey-Garcia later failed several aspects of a field sobriety test and twice refused to give a breathalyzer sample.

The technology – dubbed Wine Blockchain EY – has been developed as part of EZLab's AgriOpenData cloud-hosted farm management software platform. It will store records with details about the wine's cultivation, supply chain and geographical origin, and allow customers to access those details by scanning a QR code on the bottle with their smartphone (see image below). The first wine to be tracked and certified using the platform – which is based on the Ethereum blockchain platform produced by the Swiss non-profit Ethereum Foundation – was a Falanghina wine produced by Cantina Volpone. It is estimated that the Italian wine industry lost an estimated €2m a year to counterfeiting in 2015. Aside from the impact on the producers and loss of tax revenues for governments, the falsified wines can expose consumers to health and safety risks. Blockchain is the distributed ledger technology underpinning virtual currency Bitcoin, and interest in growing in using it to track the provenance of goods as they move through the global supply chain. Rather than relying on a paper trail or traditional electronic systems, blockchain-based record-keeping produces a permanent chain of ownership and records that is extremely difficult to alter. "It is basically a database that contains a public ledger of all transactions carried out among users since its creation," explains EZLab in documentation describing the new system. "The database is shared among all users, without intermediaries, so each participant can check the validity of the transaction chain." Once the information captured in each transaction is agreed upon by all members of the business network, it becomes a permanent record. "The AgriOpenData blockchain aims to be a transparent certification solution of authentic agricultural products, which reinforces the relationship of trust between the consumer and the entire food production chain," it continues. There is enormous hype about the use of blockchain for supply chain security and traceability – with start-ups such as Everledger and Chronicled extolling the virtues of the technology for authenticating products, and big players like IBM throwing their weight behind enterprise-level platforms. That said, some industry observers suggest that established supply chains can be slow to adopt and integrate new technologies, and there is a lack of experience within even large corporations in dealing with not only the technical aspects of distributed systems but also the legal framework in which they operate. Food traceability is however seen as potentially an early application for blockchain and last October, Walmart, IBM and Tsinghua University signed an agreement to explore food supply chain security using the technology. The goal is to improve the way food is tracked, transported and sold to consumers across China When applied to the food supply chain, digital information such as the original farm or producer, batch numbers, factory and processing data, expiration dates, storage temperatures and shipping detail can be digitally connected to food items and the information entered into the blockchain at each step of the process, according to IBM. "The record created by the blockchain can also help retailers better manage the shelf-life of products in individual stores, and further strengthen safeguards related to food authenticity," it said at the time the deal was announced.
