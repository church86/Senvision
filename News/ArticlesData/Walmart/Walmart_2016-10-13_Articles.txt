Here's what's in store. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Oct 14, 2016 at 5:07PM Image Source: Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is out to prove that bigger isn't always better. The world's largest retailer issued its yearly capital expenditure plans last week, and they reveal a stark slowdown in new store additions. In fiscal 2018, which begins next February, the company will add just 55 Wal-Mart locations in the U.S, marking its slowest store growth in more than 20 years.  Of those new locations, 35 will be Supercenters and 20 will be Neighborhood Markets, down from 60 Supercenters and 70 Neighborhood Markets this year and 69 and 161, respectively, last year. The retailer will also open just 4 new Sam's Clubs next year, down from 11 this year and 13 in fiscal 2016. Internationally, the company's expansion will continue at the recent pace with about 200 new stores to be opened. In the same report, Wal-Mart said earnings would be flat next year, sending the stock down 3%. The times are a-changing  While the market seemed to greet the company's strategic shift with skepticism, there are several reasons why slowing down new store openings seems like the right decision. Since taking the helm in 2014, CEO Doug McMillon has repeatedly said that the company needs to invest to improve performance at current stores and boost its e-commerce capabilities. Over the last two years, the company has done just that, raising minimum wage to $10/hour and spending money to clean up stores, eliminate out-of-stocks, and bring back greeters. As a result, customer satisfaction scores are up and comparable sales have increased for eight quarters in a row. In the most recent period, comps improved 1.6%, its fastest pace in several years. Wal-Mart is dialing down its capital expenditures in the U.S. from to $6.8 billion last year to $6.4 billion this year to $6.1 billion in fiscal 2018. Instead of spending to open new stores, the company is "increasing investments in e-commerce, technology, store remodels, and other customer initiatives." With overall e-commerce sales increasing by about 15% a year in the U.S., Wal-Mart has recognized that it's better off leveraging its current store base rather than opening new stores as its real estate is not nearly as crucial in the e-commerce era, especially when the company already has stores within five miles of 70% of the U.S. population. Having already saturated the country with stores, investing in remodels and e-commerce is the best use of the retailer's investment dollars. The nitty-gritty Wal-Mart made noise earlier this year with its $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com, ramping up its e-commerce position, but making its stores more appealing is just as much a key to its strategy. As McMillon said, "Our customers want us to run great stores, provide a great e-commerce experience and find ways to save them money and time seamlessly." Over the last 18 months, the company has been testing components such as layouts, signage, and front ends, and it's planning on remodeling 500 of its stores next year and adding online grocery pickup to another 500.  Wal-Mart's online grocery pickup program has been perhaps the company's most successful innovation in recent years. The retailer now allows customers to order groceries online and pick up them up at kiosks in store parking lots at scheduled times for no extra charge. The program, now offered in hundreds of stores and dozens of markets, has proven exceedingly popular and is a hybrid of physical and e-commerce retail that Wal-Mart is best positioned to offer. By the end of next year, it will have online grocery pick-up in more than 1,000 stores, or about a quarter of its national footprint. So called click-and-collect has been successful enough to prompt Amazon.com to launch its own chain of convenience stores, according to reports from the Wall Street Journal this week. The bottom line for Wal-Mart is that with a comparable store base of more than 4,000 locations, the company is better off driving profitability by increasing comparable sales and building out its e-commerce channel.  With about $300 billion in sales from its U.S. stores, just a 1% swing in comparable sales would add $3 billion in revenue and $750 million gross profit. The average supercenter generates about $80 million in annual revenue, meaning the company would have to open 38 new stores just to equal the effect of a 1% uptick on comps on revenue -- and many more to match the effect on gross profit -- as comparable sales are a much more efficient way to increase profitability. Wal-Mart investors may be disappointed to see flat earnings growth once again next year, but the company is making the right moves to position itself for continued growth into the future. With a massive store footprint, improving its in-store experience and enhancing e-commerce will allow it to grow profits in fiscal 2019 and beyond.

Based on the impact of America’s Biggest Health Fair, held by Walmart last year, the company is again hosting the largest single-day health event in the nation, with free health screenings expected to benefit hundreds of thousands of people, some whom may be taking an active role in their health for the first time. The newly named Walmart Wellness Day will take place from noon to 4 p.m. lOct. 15, in more than 4,600 Walmart stores across the country. The event will provide free blood glucose and blood pressure testing, vision screenings (where available), product samples and information on health insurance options. Additionally, more than 10,000 of Walmart’s licensed pharmacists will offer immunizations in all Walmart pharmacies in the US. Walmart set five world records with last year’s single-day event for the most: Blood pressure, glucose and vision screenings – more than 280,000 screenings were conducted Immunizations – nearly 52,000 administered Food samples – more than 2 million free samples of healthier foods were distributed to customers Nearly 3,000 customers were advised to visit their health care professional based on their blood glucose screening results 1.7 million Americans are diagnosed with diabetes every year, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention More than 7,000 reports of high blood pressure detected About 75 million American adults (32 percent) have high blood pressure—that’s 1 in every 3 adults, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention “The cost of health care in America has risen to more than $3 trillion, but the health of our customers is something we can’t put a price on,” said George Riedl, senior vice president and president, Health and Wellness, Walmart U.S. “As more than 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, we’re committed to and uniquely positioned to provide accessible and affordable healthcare that helps busy families live better. Walmart Wellness Day is at the center of that commitment. These screenings provide customers with a basic yet vital understanding of their general health conditions and ways to improve them.” Walmart has conducted thousands of health screenings over the past several years, some of which may have had lifesaving results. Last year, a Walmart pharmacy manager in Everett, Penn., reported that one patient’s readings during the wellness event were so alarming that she went immediately to the emergency room where she was treated for a hypertensive emergency. Her family, her doctors and the patient were all extremely grateful for Walmart’s clinical intervention. During Walmart Wellness Day, companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Gojo, BD, Pfizer, US Nutrition, Bausch & Lomb, Clorox, Bayer, 3M, Kellogg’s, GSK, Tums, Chile Avocadoes, Dannon, Uncle Ben’s and Vega will be instore providing customers with free product samples.  For the third year, Walmart is working with DirectHealth.com to help customers identify their health insurance needs, compare coverage options and enroll in the plan that is right for them. The customer open enrollment program for Medicare and Affordable Care Act plans –Healthcare Begins Here –will be available Oct. 15 – Jan. 31, 2017, in more than 2,300 Walmart stores, online and via phone.

More: If spanking taught me anything, it's that spanking doesn't work The unnamed shopper was waiting to pay for her items at register 11 in the Payson, Utah, store when she went into labor. According to the store manager, Dustin Haight, she "insisted on paying for her merchandise" before she had the baby. Yes, that's right. Despite being "in distress, on her knees holding her stomach," the mom-to-be wanted to settle all monies owed before having the baby, right there in the Walmart checkout line. Anyone who's ever given birth will recognize this for what it is: amazing. Any woman who is able to do anything beyond curse and writhe around in agony when those labor pains hit deserves major respect. Can you imagine how efficient she is at home?

Apparently, the staff has had a real morale boost following the birth, and are planning a ceremony for the new arrival — believed to be a boy — as part of a grand opening later this month. The company is also going to gift diapers, formula, clothes and a birthday cake to the family. Register 11 has now been dubbed "register baby" — good for pregnant women approaching their due date to know just in case they want to avoid it.

People gathered for a public session hosted by Tom Valenti, developer of the planned Mission Gateway project, heard plenty Thursday night about the retailers that got away. But the audience of about 75 reserved their biggest reaction to the one they were happy to let go, Walmart. “We’ve been at it for a long time as you know,” Valenti said. “Our plan is to replace Walmart with several smaller retailers.” The room at Sylvester Powell Community Center erupted in applause. Walmart announced at the beginning of the month it was dropping out the development. Valenti, who has been pursuing the project since 2005, had seen the retail giant as the economic engine to power the rest of the development. But despite his attempts to make the 155,000 square-foot Walmart store fit in with the original mixed-use plan envisioned for Mission Gateway, it faced stiff public opposition in Mission. “I got the message in April when it was clear the voters did not want Walmart,” Valenti said, referring to the Mission election that shifted the City Council against the retail giant. Later in the meeting however, Valenti listed retailers he has tried to line up to replace Walmart who’ve said no including Costco, J.C. Penney, Trader Joe’s, Crate and Barrel, Macy’s, Bed, Bath and Beyond, Kohl’s and Steinmart. Valenti, who has developed other shopping centers around the country, said the current retail market is in flux, with many stores no longer expanding or contracting. He declined to identify the potential tenants he’s negotiating with, except to say one would definitely be a grocer, the others are computer-related, sporting goods “and a few other things as well.” The only definite ingredient in the $180 million project at this point is a 150-room Aloft hotel and 50-room Element extended stay hotel planned for the corner of Roeland Drive and Shawnee Mission Parkway. The hotels would have two fine dining restaurants on the first floor. Valenti also is confident about 200 apartments will be developed along Roeland Drive and Johnson Drive in three-level buildings with first floor retail or restaurants. “The market for the apartments will be people who want to be in the area and near the Plaza but not as expensive as the Plaza,” he said. A swimming pool planned for the hotels also will be available to the apartment dwellers. And Valenti said if he could line up a tenant, he would still like to build an approximately 50,000 square-foot office building east of the hotel. That led to another one-that-got-away moment. “In 2012, we were 24 hours away from signing a letter of intent from AMC,” he said, referring to the movie chain’s headquarters. “As the last minute, they decided to go to Park Place.” The audience was there to listen and recommend what they wanted to see at the development. Valenti said he’d tried almost all the retailers suggested, but promised to continue working them. “If you’re anxious to get this going, I’m a thousand times more anxious,” he said. “My hope is for a spring start.” Comment Categories : Development, Mission Gateway Previous Post Next Post Comments Comments Related Construction under way on Market Lofts apartment project in downtown Overland Park Roeland Park in discussions with potential tenants for old pool site New residential development plan submitted for old Leawood Country Club property Spotlight on Local Casey's Auto Repair Carl Casey is following in the footsteps of his father Ray Casey who has served the Mission and surrounding areas for over 45 years.

How the World’s Biggest Costume Maker Cracked Halloween Howard Beige, co-owner of Rubie’s, knows your 10-year-old wants to be Jigglypuff. He knows you secretly want to go as Harley Quinn. He can even predict the next president—usually. By Claire Suddath | October 14, 2016 Photographs by Emiliano Granado Video by Ali Withers From J.J. Abrams needs a favor. It’s six weeks before Halloween and he’s in search of a very specific Star Wars costume, in a very specific size, that’s sold out online. Abrams may have directed last year’s Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but when a friend’s daughter wants to be the warrior Rey for Halloween, he still has to track down a costume like a normal person. But of course a normal person wouldn’t have an assistant who can call up Howard Beige, executive vice president of Rubie’s Costume Co., the largest costume maker in the world and the manufacturer of roughly half of all the Halloween costumes sold in the U.S., including all the Star Wars ones. Abrams’s assistant reaches Beige as he pulls up to the Rubie’s factory in Queens, which is churning out rush orders for sold-out costumes. Sitting in his cluttered Mercedes with a drink-stained cupholder and a bag of Famous Amos cookies in the glove compartment, Beige notes the size Abrams is looking for and promises to have the costume sent over right away. He then walks into the facility, where 100 women are frantically sewing purple pants and blazers for Joker costumes from the 2008 movie The Dark Knight. “They have their thumb on the pulse of what people want” If you’ve ever dressed up as a movie or television character for Halloween, the costume you bought was probably made by Rubie’s. The odds drop a little with generic characters like witches or vampires—plenty of smaller companies make those—but with more than 20,000 costumes and accessories for sale at retailers like Walmart, Amazon, and Party City, Rubie’s has probably played a part in your Halloween festivities. What started in 1951 as a soda shop/novelty store in Queens has, over the past 65 years, grown into an international business that earns hundreds of millions. (It doesn’t disclose figures, but the analytics firm IbisWorld estimates $251 million in revenue in the U.S.) Rubie’s has 3,000 employees, contracts with 12 factories in China, owns four factories in the U.S., and runs six large warehouses, four on Long Island, one in Arizona, and one in South Carolina. Rubie’s has also spawned 15 subsidiaries in countries such as Japan, the Netherlands, and the U.K. It sells Carnival costumes in Brazil, Day of the Dead dresses in Mexico, and Easter Bunny and Santa Claus suits around the world. But in America its bread and butter is still Halloween. The company and the holiday have enjoyed a relationship not unlike a happy marriage: The success of one fosters the growth of the other. “Halloween is not the same holiday it was even 10 years ago,” Beige says, with a smile. “I like to think we had a hand in that.” Americans will shell out a record-breaking $8.4 billion on Halloween candy, costumes, and decorations this year, according to the National Retail Federation. That figure has jumped almost 70 percent in just 10 years, making Halloween the second-largest holiday in terms of decoration sales, behind Christmas. In the process, it’s become age-proof. “What was once a kid’s holiday has become something that most adults now participate in, too,” says Lesley Bannatyne, a historian and the author of Halloween: An American Holiday, an American History. Nearly half of all American adults will dress up this year, twice as many as 30 years ago. Candy and costumes are cheap enough that Halloween is also largely recession-proof, as well; sales actually increased in 2008 because, as Beige puts it, “almost anyone can buy a $9 mask from Walmart.” But figuring out what that mask should be, and how many to make, isn’t easy. More people are dressing up for Halloween, but they’re doing it differently, picking costumes in early October based on news events, movies, or internet memes that went viral only a few weeks or months before. Rubie’s tries to anticipate Halloween trends a year in advance, but it’s constantly adjusting its plans as expected blockbusters flop (The Legend of Tarzan), beloved actors die (Gene Wilder’s Willy Wonka costume will be popular this year), or millions of people get swept up in the Pokémon Go craze and Beige finds himself mass-manufacturing last-minute Pikachu costumes to fill thousands of back orders. Pokémon will break into Rubie’s 10 best-selling costumes this year, which didn’t happen when it was popular the first time around. “Thank God we already had the license and the designs for that one,” he says. “Otherwise, it would’ve been a disaster.” At 58, Beige has thinning gray hair and a smile that never seems to fade. He has retained enough of his Queens accent that when he complains about his waistline, his version of “yuuuge” sounds just like Donald Trump’s. He co-runs the family-owned company with his older brother Marc and sister Maxine (another brother has retired), but while his siblings focus on finances and customer accounts, Beige plays the part of affable costume enthusiast, sweet-talking Hollywood studios into letting the company design outfits based on their movie characters, then persuading stores to carry them. “Howie is one of the most passionate people with regards to his company and the quality of his products of anyone I’ve ever met in this business,” says Pam Kaufman, chief marketing officer and president of consumer products at Nickelodeon. “They have their thumb on the pulse of what people want,” says Danny Gurganus, co-owner of Danny’s Trix & Kix, a 17,000-square-foot costume shop in Spring, Texas. He estimates that Rubie’s accounts for 60 percent of his sales. “What are we going to do? Not sell to Walmart?” Rubie’s is named after Beige’s father, Rubin, who opened the soda shop and novelty store with his wife, Tillie, in the Woodhaven neighborhood of Queens in 1951. Rubin Beige had once worked for a furrier, so when he noticed that the funny masks and hats he carried were selling well, he whipped up a few costumes—cowboys, angels, witches—that people could rent for parties, theatrical productions, and of course Halloween. Soon he was selling them to other stores. “Years later I found out that there was a word for that: wholesale,” says Howard, “At the time, we just thought of it as selling stuff around town.” By the time Rubin died, in 1972, the soda shop had become a full-blown costume company, pulling in $100,000 a year, most of it from high-quality rental costumes that cost stores about $300 to buy and people about $30 to rent. The newly widowed Tillie divided the company equally among her four children and told them that if they couldn’t make it big enough to support four families, she’d sell it. “So that’s what we did,” says Beige, who was then still in high school. Beige officially joined Rubie’s in 1975. At just 17 years old, he spent the summer visiting costume shops around the country, selling his wares from a pop-up clothing rack he kept in the trunk of a Dodge Colt. He later upgraded to a motor home, which he toured in for another six years. He showered in campgrounds. He was robbed outside a Howard Johnson in Redwood City, Calif. (“Wigs all over the parking lot!”) And he ultimately persuaded hundreds of costume shops to buy from Rubie’s. “Howie used to park that thing in our driveway,” says Terrie Frankel, 71, who owns Frankel’s Costume in Houston and was one of Rubie’s earliest customers, “and I’d bring him bagels and lox for breakfast.” Beige’s motor home tours coincided with a significant shift in the way Halloween was celebrated. In the 1970s, people stopped renting costumes in favor of cheaply produced wear-once items. The top manufacturer of these disposable outfits at the time and into the ’80s was Ben Cooper, a company that licensed movie and TV characters, then turned them into children’s costumes that rarely looked like the originals. Star Trek, for example, became a $3 Captain Kirk mask and plastic jumpsuit with a picture of the Starship Enterprise on it. “I actually went to Paramount and said, ‘This is ridiculous,’ ” says Beige. In 1989, he pitched the company’s executives on an adult-size replica of a Star Trek uniform. “I showed them a beautiful reproduction of the actual uniform Captain Kirk wore with the pips on the collar and the patch. They said, ‘What about the mask?’ I said, ‘The people who buy this costume want to be Captain Kirk but as themselves.’ ” He got the license the same day. Rubie’s began to pitch other rightsholders, picking up licenses for Barbie (1993), Star Wars (1994), Nickelodeon (2000), and Marvel (2014). It also gobbled up competitors: a by-then-struggling Ben Cooper (which came with Hanna-Barbera’s and DC Comics’ licenses) and novelty maker Forum. When Rubie’s doesn’t have a license, it produces look-alikes: Rival company Disguise carries the official Snow White costume, but at Rubie’s you can buy a suspiciously familiar red-blue-and-yellow dress and go as “Cottage Princess.” The team of enchanted seamstresses, with Beige, at Rubie’s Richmond Hill, Queens, factory. Photographer: Emiliano Granado for Bloomberg Businessweek Costumes are big business for studios. Not only are they essentially free marketing—a little girl dressed as Rey reminds all her friends just how cool Star Wars can be—but they generate a nice chunk of change without requiring much work. “I mean, come on, we’re a kid’s network, we have to have Halloween costumes—it’s the second most important time of the year for us outside of the [winter] holidays,” says Nickelodeon’s Kaufman. “Rubie’s goes to great lengths ... to make sure the right costume is available,” says Kelly Gilmore, senior vice president for global toys at Warner Bros. Consumer Products. About 55 percent of Rubie’s sales come from licensed costumes, which average about $20 for children and $35 for adults, although it sells plenty of elaborate get-ups for hundreds of dollars. About 8 percent of a costume’s retail price goes toward studio royalties, which means the studios can expect to make tens of millions each Halloween. Warner Bros., for example, accounts for more than 3,000 different products. The largest individual license, DC Comics’ Batman, has led to all-black Batman costumes from the Christopher Nolan films, blue-and-gray Batmans from the original ’60s television show, gray-and-black Batmans from the Arkham video games, and even a line of costumes based on the 2009 comic-book series Blackest Night, in which Batman was a zombie. March’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice inspired 300 costumes, for infants through adults. Rubie’s plans its tie-ins about two years in advance. The day before Abrams’s assistant called about the Rey costume, Beige had a meeting with Lucasfilm in which the studio presented him with the general plot, characters, and sketches for Star Wars: Episode VIII, which is scheduled for release in December 2017. Rubie’s designers (who must adhere to a strict nondisclosure agreement and will not tell you what happens in the next installment, no matter how much you beg) will soon send its Episode VIII looks to Lucasfilm for sign-offs. “The studios approve concept before we start, then the prototype,” says John Clausen, Rubie’s general manager, who’s been with the company since 1979. “And they do constant sampling of production in the process.” Rubie’s has already finished costumes for next year’s Wonder Woman movie (sparkly wrist-cuffs!), Spider-Man: Homecoming (one of the costumes is designed to look homemade, like Peter Parker’s first try), and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. It’s also planning a 2017 line of costumes for adults and kids from ’90s Nickelodeon cartoons, such as Rugrats and Hey Arnold! The studios have figured out the hard way that if they’re too tight-lipped about upcoming movie plots, Rubie’s won’t know which characters to focus on. When Beige was planning the lineup for 1999’s Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace, Lucasfilm intimated that Darth Maul would be its breakout character, much as Darth Vader had been in the original films. “Darth Maul was about 50 percent of the assortment for Episode I costumes, but then he gets killed in the movie,” Beige says. “We did not know that.” Rubie’s wound up selling only half of its Darth Maul inventory that year because people—kids, especially—don’t usually want to be characters who wind up losing a lightsaber fight. Lucasfilm now tells him which characters live or die. Rubie’s used to manufacture all of its costumes in the U.S., because it was convenient. Halloween sales have a finite deadline, and products made in other countries often don’t make it in time. In the early ’90s most of the company’s competitors moved overseas to take advantage of cheaper labor. And unlike regular clothes, which are subject to high import duties, most costumes are considered “festive apparel” and can be imported duty-free. In 1997, Rubie’s petitioned U.S. Customs and Border Protection to change the rule but lost. As a result, the company says that to remain competitive it was forced to move about 70 percent of its production overseas, mostly to China. It wasn’t an easy transition; in 2005 a Rubie’s factory in Mexico that produced Barbie costumes was accused of flouting labor laws. A U.S. Department of Labor report found that the Mexican government hadn’t inspected the factory in years, and a separate audit by Mattel uncovered a worker who was only 15 years old, legal in Mexico but too young to meet either Mattel’s or Rubie’s guidelines. Two labor unions, each backed by a different Mexican political party, fought for power within the factory. There were protests. Rubie’s closed the plant. (Mattel and Rubie’s still work together; this year kids can go as superhero, ballerina, or bride Barbies.) Recently, Rubie’s has become frustrated with U.S. Customs again. It claims the agency is applying its festive-apparel rule inconsistently. At issue are Santa Claus suits, which Rubie’s says fall into the festive category and Customs classifies as outfits and subjects them to high taxes. According to Customs, the difference between a costume and apparel is in how it’s made. Anything “flimsy” (Customs’ term) is tax-free. The agency has decided that the company’s more elaborate costumes count as regular clothing and can therefore be taxed, sometimes by as much as 30 percent. “You can have a skeleton costume and, if it’s well made, with nice tight stitching and finished edges, it counts as apparel. The exact same design, but cheaply sewn, is a costume,” says Arthur Bodek, a partner at Grunfeld, Desiderio, Lebowitz, Silverman & Klestadt, a law firm that specializes in international trade laws. Rubie’s smallest factory churns out a few thousand costumes a day. Photographer: Emiliano Granado for Bloomberg Businessweek “If you say costumes are subject to a tax of X amount, we’d know what to do. But you can’t tell us one year our products are apparel and another year they’re festive,” says Marc Beige, the company’s CEO. Rubie’s is still fighting the reclassification of the Santa suits in court. The company’s four U.S. factories spend most of the year making small batches of high-end costumes, such as a $1,000 Darth Vader costume that sells to the cosplay/Comic Con crowd. The year-round convention circuit has given Rubie’s a sizable boost in its non-Halloween sales; the company has a booth at nearly every major sci-fi/fantasy convention, where Beige can talk to fans about what brands he should be licensing. Because Comic Con–goers will spend a lot to mimic their favorite characters, Rubie’s can afford to make those in the U.S. In August, though, even the U.S. factories switch to the cheaper products, so Rubie’s can take advantage of the shipping convenience. The smallest factory, behind Rubie’s retail shop in Queens, holds 100 workers—older women, mostly—who churn out a few thousand costumes a day. It’s not enough to service Amazon’s needs, but it’s more than enough to replenish a favorite at the mom and pop stores a week before the holiday. “Halloween is not the same holiday it was even 10 years ago. I like to think we had a hand in that.” Photographer: Emiliano Granado for Bloomberg Businessweek Last-minute orders are still the biggest challenge for Rubie’s. “I can FedEx something to an independent store’s doorstep, but with Amazon and Walmart, it has to go to their distribution centers and then out,” Beige says. Rubie’s gives big-box retailers a cutoff date of mid- to late September for shipments; smaller shops can order until the day before Halloween. But that doesn’t mean the heavy hitters don’t try to squeeze in a few late requests. In the last few weeks Rubie’s has received a wave of orders for creepy clown masks, and its South Carolina plants are currently working to fill Walmart’s frantic request for more Pokémon costumes. “People might get mad if they know we’re doing that for Walmart,” Beige says, “but what are we going to do? Not sell to Walmart?” The relationship between Rubie’s smaller and bigger customers hasn’t always been pleasant. The company used to prioritize orders based on quantity—until it realized that Amazon would always get its orders filled before everyone else. “If Joe Independent pre-ordered all his costumes in January, but Amazon comes in with an order in June that wipes us out, Joe wouldn’t get anything,” says Tom Tinari, who manages Rubie’s more than 1 million square feet of warehouse space. The company now uses a computer system that balances quantity with the timing of an order to ensure the little guys don’t get left out. Small costume shops are still important to Beige, and not just because of people like Terrie Frankel, who know him from his motor home days. They give Rubie’s on-the-ground consumer insight that large corporations just can’t provide. Every January, Rubie’s hosts an annual meeting in Las Vegas with its oldest independent clients. Representatives from about 400 stores attend. Beige debuts the company’s upcoming product line for them and asks if they’ve missed anything that customers have been requesting. “Last year, we had people ask for [the horror-themed video game] Five Nights at Freddy’s, which wasn’t a costume anyone made,” says Gurganus, the costume shop owner in Texas, “When we had our meeting in January, I told them about it.” “I’d never heard of the game before,” admits Beige. Rubie’s picked up the license and now makes a line of creepy, misshapen, stuffed-animal costumes based on the characters in the game. (This year, the ’80s-vintage, Stephen King–inspired Netflix series Stranger Things took Rubie’s by surprise; kids hoping to be the telekinetic hero Eleven will have to resort to Etsy, until next year. The same goes for Ken Bone, the undecided voter whose mustache and red sweater provided the only feel-good moment in the second presidential debate.) The company also maintains three retail stores in New York—each the size of a city block—that it uses as test laboratories for costumes it has yet to put on the market. It’s tricks like these that have helped Rubie’s stay more or less in step with what people want. This year, Beige has noticed that more people are buying costumes as a group. Families are dressing in themes. (Rubie’s isn’t the only company to pick up on this: Children’s clothier Chasing Fireflies also offers several upscale Halloween costumes for families.) Millennials never really stopped dressing up for Halloween, Beige points out, and now that they’re starting to have their own kids, their parties have become less about getting drunk and more about family fun. “It’s the biggest change I’ve seen in a generation,” he says. And it’s causing Rubie’s to rethink the way it sells certain types of costumes: “Anything that can be a theme—superheroes, Star Wars, Wizard of Oz—is getting more popular.” For all Rubie’s attention to cultural shifts, some of its costumes are fairly retrograde. Target may have eliminated gender designations from its toy aisles, and the Disney Store’s online shop now calls all its Halloween costumes simply “for kids,” but the “girl” versions of Rubie’s outfits still have flirty skirts, even when they’re creatures that don’t wear clothes, like Pepé Le Pew, the Looney Tunes skunk. Women’s versions of superhero costumes are often skintight Lycra dresses, worn in its catalog by models in stilettos. There has been some pushback on the gender type-casting; women have started going as male superheroes instead of their feminine (and often less famous) counterparts. “We now make a female Iron Man costume, even though there isn’t really a female character in the movie,” says Beige. “Of course, sometimes they just buy the men’s version anyway.” Sexy schoolgirls and kittens, which peaked in popularity in 2006, started falling out of favor during the recession and have never recovered. Rubie’s still holds the Playboy license and offers everything from French maid outfits to a black-and-white-striped minidress that passes for a very unrealistic football referee—but every year they become a smaller part of Rubie’s business. Halloween is the second-largest holiday in terms of decoration sales, behind Christmas. Photographer: Emiliano Granado for Bloomberg Businessweek This year’s presidential election falls just eight days after Oct. 31, and a certain orange-faced candidate has upended costume trends. Beige used to claim that during election years he could determine the winner based on which candidate’s mask sold best. Bill Clinton’s beat George H.W. Bush’s, George W. outsold Al Gore, and almost nobody wanted to be John Kerry or John McCain. This year, though, all bets are off. “Two things are happening that make this election different. One, people are dressing up as Trump to both make fun of him and support him,” says Beige, who likens the Republican nominee’s costume-related popularity to the plethora of Sarah Palins in 2008. “Two, women don’t generally wear masks—they’ll do face paint—and how many guys are going to go as Hillary?” As far as masks are concerned, Trump is beating Hillary in a landslide. His bloated, rubbery face hangs above the door at Rubie’s retail shop in Queens, next to Bernie Sanders, Chris Christie, both Clintons, and a now dated Bernie Madoff. But among the families and couples shopping on a Saturday evening less than a month before Halloween, Trump inspires little more than the occasional snicker or finger-point. A group of college-age dudes don’t even notice him; they’re too busy triggering the motion sensor that animates a man sizzling in an electric chair, one of the mechanical decorations peppered throughout the store for ambience. The figure spasms as terrified people scurry by. There’s also a 15-foot-tall giant that cackles, a cigar-wielding clown that sings classic rock, and a head-spinning Linda Blair in mid-exorcism. “Honey, that’s not Supergirl, that’s Catwoman,” a mother explains to her daughter, who’s dragged her by the hand into the children’s superhero aisle and is eyeing a stretchy black bodysuit with accompanying eye mask — one of the few girls’ costumes that doesn’t have a skirt. “You said you wanted to be Supergirl.” “But I want to wear this!” the little girl says. “You don’t even watch anything with Catwoman in it,” her mom says, perplexed. Nearby, pre-teen girls swarm the Pokémon display while a couple bicker over which superhero duo they’re going to be. (He wants them to go as the Joker and Harley Quinn from Suicide Squad. She hasn’t seen the movie and thinks they should be Superman and Wonder Woman.) A family of five contemplates matching Minion costumes from Despicable Me. The aspiring Catwoman is still begging. Her mother sighs and takes the costume off the shelf. “Are you sure about this?” she asks. The girl nods. They walk to the register. Behind them, two 12-year-old boys hug a lifesize Batgirl mannequin then, embarrassed, quickly run away. Editor: Miranda Purves   Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2016 Bloomberg L.P.

She’s not Hannah Montana, but she’s also not a wild and crazy girl who will do anything for attention, she says. It’s been a struggle to discover who she is, and to portray that to the world, because she said she never felt comfortable fitting into any “boxes,” and it felt like everyone wanted to categorize her. She feels that she, along with most humans, is beyond categorization, according to Yahoo. She is actually balanced and introspective, she says. Her partying days are over. “People saw me as being wild, and literally all I do is I’m obsessed with yoga, I love hiking, and I’m reading constantly. My life is so positive. From the outside, people think I’m partying with rappers. That was back in my prime.” At just 23-years-old, that statement seems like it would come from a much older person, but Cyrus said she’s been in the world of show business her entire life, playing Hannah Montana and selling a line of clothing at Walmart that was branded Hannah Montana. But when Walmart found out that Cyrus smoked marijuana, they let her clothing line go, she said. “It was Walmart or weed. And you see what I did — I chose the weed.” According to Variety, Cyrus had a difficult time making sense of her sexuality because she was raised in a southern, traditional household. “My whole life, I didn’t understand my own gender and my own sexuality. I always hated the word ‘bisexual,’ because that’s even putting me in a box. I don’t ever think about someone being a boy or someone being a girl. Also, my nipple pasties and s–t never felt sexualized to me. My eyes started opening in the fifth or sixth grade. My first relationship in my life was with a chick. I grew up in a very religious Southern family. The universe has always given me the power to know I’ll be OK. Even at that time, when my parents didn’t understand, I just felt that one day they are going to understand.” [Image by Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images] She said it was difficult at the time to identify with anyone, because she didn’t feel like a boy or like a girl, unlike her ultra-feminine mother. Her mother loves all aspects of femininity, but Miley could not relate, even though at the time, the world was trying to make her the poster child for girlhood on the show Hannah Montana. “My mom is like an ’80s rock chick — big blonde hair, big boobs. She loves being a girl. I never felt that way. I know some girls that love getting their nails done. I f—–g hated it. My nails look like s–t. I don’t wax my eyebrows. I never related to loving being a girl. And then, being a boy didn’t sound fun to me. I think the LGBTQ alphabet could continue forever. But there’s a “P” that should happen, for “pansexual.” According to The Daily News, “pansexual” is a term that means you are open to every possibility. Jennifer Bass, communications director at the Kinsey Institute, a prominent research center on human sexuality, says that “calling oneself pansexual is to open yourself up to every human possibility.” [Image by Rob Kim/Getty Images] Miley says she is neutral — neither straight or gay. What she is definitely not neutral about is her feelings for Donald Trump. She says she is a big Bernie Sanders supporter and she says she thought that Donald Trump running for president was just a joke that would not amount to anything big. “This is not a dig. But I do think there’s something that goes with the Kardashians and Trump. The Kardashians are better than Trump, because they are not trying to run the country. They are just trying to be famous, and that’s fine. We are obsessed with celebrity. When Trump started this, I was laughing. I thought it’s not going to go anywhere; there’s no way he’ll be the candidate.” Now that he is the candidate, however, and Bernie Sanders is out, she minces no words about people who don’t support Hillary Clinton. “That’s f*****g crazy and you’re out of your mind. It’s literally p*****g me off more than anything. If you could ever consider Donald Trump, you never understood Bernie in the first place.” [Featured Image by Theo Wargo/Getty Images] Now Watch This: Dream Kardashian Is Already A Social Media Sensation Now Read This: Lil Wayne Dances To Politically Upset Fans At Flog Gnaw After Race Incident Share 2 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Amy Schaeffer Tags: Miley Cyrus Bernie Sanders Supporter, Miley Cyrus dislikes Trump, Miley Cyrus pansexual Comments LATEST HEADLINES 2016 College Football Playoff Rankings: Predicting Top 4 Teams After Week 11 Action Reince Priebus Named Chief Of Staff By Donald Trump In Controversial Move NBA Trade Rumors: Shaquille O’Neal Hints Demarcus Cousins on Trading Block ‘Steep’ Beta Opens Up To Everyone November 18 Prior To December 2 Release Date Stahl-Trump Interview: Up To Three Million Deportations, Special Prosecutor For Clinton Possible [Video] L.A.

File photo by Rich Sugg rsugg@kcstar.com i By Steve Vockrodt svockrodt@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Mission Gateway developer Tom Valenti started a meeting at the Sylvester Powell Jr. Community Center on Thursday evening by telling a crowd there what had been announced the week before: No more Wal-Mart. That elicited a hearty round of applause from the gathering of about 50 people in Mission. Wal-Mart’s decision to abandon the long-stalled Mission Gateway project gives Valenti’s plans some semblance of renewal: Residents by and large didn’t want the ubiquitous retailer and made their feelings known at several public meetings over the years. The tone of Thursday evening’s meeting marked a departure from those previous meetings where Valenti typically encountered criticism. Instead, residents offered their ideas and shared a dialogue with Valenti. Valenti, the Syracuse, N.Y., principal with the Cameron Group who has tried for more than 10 years to get development started at the 16 acres between Shawnee Mission Parkway and Johnson Drive, told Mission residents about his challenges with the project over the years, as well as his hope for the future. First, the future: Valenti said he wants to start construction next spring on a project that replaces a 155,000-square-foot Wal-Mart store with three smaller retailers. Many aspects of his previous plans remain the same — apartments, restaurants, an Aloft hotel and an Element extended-stay hotel. Valenti said he’s pursuing a grocery store, a sporting goods shop and a computer-related shop. “But that could change,” he said. He didn’t name the potential tenants. An office building is possible, but Valenti said he would need a tenant to agree to occupy at least half of it before he could obtain financing. To make the project happen, Valenti said he needs a combination of tax increment financing and a community improvement district — two development tools that redirect taxes generated by the project to reimburse the developer for certain costs. Valenti suggested that he may need general obligation bonds, which would require the city to pledge its credit behind the project and cover debts if Mission Gateway underperforms. “I wish I didn’t have to ask for it, but I have to ask for it,” Valenti said. “I hope we’re not going to need general obligation bonds.” Such incentives would require Mission City Council approval. Mission Mayor Steve Schowengerdt said the council’s appetite for general obligations bonds will depend on how much is requested. “It would not be my first choice,” he said. Valenti recounted the long history of his experience with Mission Gateway since the old Mission Mall was demolished. He described near misses, like the time he said he came within 24 hours of signing a letter of intent to relocate AMC Entertainment Inc.’s corporate headquarters from downtown Kansas City. AMC decided in 2011 to move to Leawood’s Park Place development instead. And then the issue of Wal-Mart, which he once said would be the “rocket fuel” to finally get Mission Gateway going but instead became a touchy subject among Mission residents. Mission residents didn’t want the retailer, and Roeland Park leaders didn’t want to lose their Wal-Mart store and all the tax revenue it generates for the suburb’s budget. “I understand the applause about there’s no Wal-Mart; however, Wal-Mart is the world’s No. 1 bricks-and-mortar retailer, they’re the No. 1 retail credit, they’re the No. 1 employer,” Valenti said. “I understand the misgivings about Wal-Mart. Please understand, though, we had a lease signed with Wal-Mart and the City Council had approved the plan with the Wal-Mart in it. We had a signed lease and I had an obligation. They didn’t back out and, quite frankly, I may not be the smartest guy in the world but I got the message back in April when it was clear the voters did not want Wal-Mart.” In Mission’s April elections, a slate of candidates opposed to the Wal-Mart-anchored development won seats on the Mission City Council, stacking the deck against Valenti’s plan. Wal-Mart later pulled out of the development and opted to renovate its Roeland Park store. Valenti recounted a number of retailers that he has pursued for the site — Trader Joe’s, Kohl’s, Menard’s, many others — that have all said no. Valenti said he had been in negotiations with Costco, the wholesale retailer, but that plan did not come to pass. Still, he said he continues to work with several retailers. After addressing the crowd for nearly 90 minutes, Valenti thanked them for their time. And he got his second round of applause of the evening.

Published Oct 13th, 2016 6:43 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas The Walmart Express Campus store experiment was unveiled in 2011 with the opening of a mini-convenience store at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. But the retailer has closed two of the five stores in the pilot program in the past year leaving many to wonder if the concept will soon end. The Walmart Express campus store at the University of Missouri was closed Oct. 7, after the retailer opted to not renew a lease agreement. Last summer Walmart U.S. closed its campus store on the Georgia Tech campus about two years after it opened. The company did not give a reason for the Georgia store closing. In the spring of 2015, Walmart opened a campus store at Virginia Commonwealth University, just three months before it closed the store at Georgia Tech. Walmart U.S. has just three – University of Arkansas, Arizona State  University (Tempe, Ariz.) and the Richmond campus at Virginia Commonwealth, according to Walmart corporate spokeswoman Delia Garcia – of the campus stores in operation, which is not enough sampling for the retailer to assess the format, according to some retail consultants. When the mini-store concept began, then Walmart U.S. CEO Bill Simon had a mission to explore the small-store convenience model formats as supercenter traffic was being hammered by the smaller dollar store chains. But when Greg Foran was named Walmart U.S. CEO, much of the retail giant’s focus has been to turn around supercenter business which Foran has said is the company’s best profit center. Walmart U.S. will open fewer brick and mortar stores being next year. Wal-Mart Stores execs have said U.S. capital expenditures next year will be $11 billion, with twice as much going to e-commerce and tech investments than to new stores. The retailer is also investing more in store remodels to match new store concepts that seek to do better with fresh foods and include online grocery pick-up areas. The online grocery option will be rolled to 500 locations by the end of next year. Thomas Jensen, marketing professor in retail at the University of Arkansas, said part of the reason Walmart and other retailers moved to college campuses was to try and gain insight into the younger generation and establish brand loyalty at the earliest stage of their young adult lives. “Retailers have a captive market when they are on college campuses and they lease space which is a lower cost than building out their own formats. I understand the college campus stores are a pilot test to learn about really small store mechanics in addition to be a branding effort,” Jensen said. He said the pharmacy component of the campus stores were a huge draw when store the first opened, at least in at the University of Arkansas. He said state laws prohibited the university’s pharmacy from distributing or filling prescriptions for contraceptives. He said Walmart took advantage of this and devoted a large amount of store space to selling contraceptive products in the local pharmacy. Jensen also said this was a convenience for students who didn’t have to leave campus for medications and contraceptives. He said merchandising the tiny format (4,600 square feet) was likely challenging for the retailer accustomed to stocking 46,000 items in a neighborhood market format or 100,000 items in a supercenter. The mini campus format does not stock fresh foods but does carry some frozen food items. “It seemed odd to me that I could buy just about everything I needed to make tacos in the campus store but no meat. It dawned on me that this format would only work for those students on campus who don’t have to prepare their own meals. It would be difficult for a student in a neighboring apartment responsible for their own meals to find everything they would need at the campus store,” Jensen said. Replenishment of small urban-like stores also takes some wrangling, Jensen said. “There’s no way Walmart can park a semi and unload into the Fayetteville campus store. Walmart uses a van from a neighboring supercenter to replenish the store inventory,” he added. He said as Walmart’s business is changing and more transactions move online, it makes sense for Walmart to invest in its bigger stores and turn them into pick-up and fulfillment centers for the online shoppers. Jensen said the tiny stores likely don’t generate enough profit to stand on their own given the limited number of items and remote shopping pool. That said, Jensen said in the beginning he thought Walmart was using the tiny formats to gain insight into how to run really small formats in urban areas like New York City or Boston. However, Foran continues to be bullish on the supercenter format and recently said Walmart would focus on opening bigger stores in outlying areas rather than going into more expensive, densely populated urban centers like Manhattan. Jensen said there are undoubtedly learnings that Walmart can take from this campus store experiment even if it does wind down the pilot in the next year.

(WNCN) – An armed man wearing a red bandana on his face stole a vehicle at a Fayetteville Wal-Mart gas station following a confrontation with the vehicle’s owner. Around 5:25 p.m., police said a man parked his 2006 Nissan Altima at the Wal-Mart gas station at 3421 Murchison Road. When the driver was inside the business, a male suspect approached a female passenger still inside the Altima. The suspect demanded money from the passenger before the driver returned and confronted the man. The suspect pulled out a handgun and fired a single round into the ground. He then ordered the passenger out of the vehicle. The suspect, who was white-t shirt, with a red bandana around his face, and a white shirt around his head, drove off in the Altima before abandoning it less than a mile from the scene. The names of the victims have not been released. Anyone with information regarding the robbery investigation is asked to contact Detective A. Stevens with the Fayetteville Police Department at (910) 391-0053 or Crimestoppers at (910) 483-TIPS (8477).

Published on October 13, 2016. Most Popular The Clinton campaign WikiLeaks keep coming. As we noted in our previous post about hacked emails from Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta -- what WikiLeaks has packaged together as "The Podesta Emails," and keeps expanding with daily additions -- there is a lot of noise and comparatively little signal in the data dump. Though thousands of individual messages have been released, Podesta had plenty of inbox-clogging incoming in the form of newsletters and news-coverage summaries prepared by Clinton campaign staffers. That said, Ad Age is continuing to review the emails for insights about the Clinton campaign's marketing, branding and overall messaging strategy. To repeat our previous note: Though you've probably been seeing lots of one- and two-sentence quotes from The Podesta Emails, we're offering full, unedited messages in the interest of establishing context. Walmart? Walmart Who? In an Aprl 30, 2014 email from Hillary Clinton (identified by her handle "Evergreen," which was previously reported to be her Secret Service code name) to assorted campaign staffers and advisers, she writes, Does anybody know about this letter Chosick article in 5/1 Times says was sent to me? Campaign adviser Philippe Reines replied all, Here is the story the Secretary is referring to, and this is the specific reference: "Last week, dozens of labor scholars and activists, including Ralph Nader, sent Mrs. Clinton a letter asking her to use her influence with Walmart to urge the retailer to raise wages for its predominantly female work force. From 1986 to 1992, Mrs. Clinton served on the board of Walmart." He pasted the full text of an April 30, 2014 New York Times piece by Amy Chozick titled "Bill Clinton Defends His Economic Legacy" into the body of his email. Then, on May 1, Clinton adviser Huma Abedin wrote, We are going to draft a response letter and send around for comment. John, can you help us with Walmart? Maybe Leslie Dach can help? Will want to give them a heads up on her letter. John is John Podesta. Leslie Dach was exec VP-government affairs and government relations at Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (dba Walmart) until June 2013. (In 2006, Ad Age called the then-former Democratic strategist "Wal-Mart's $3 Million Man," referring to the potential value of stock options he'd been granted by the retailer.) In a May 4, 2014 email, Clinton adviser Cheryl Mills replied all, Adding Leslie to whom I just spoke who is happy to be helpful both in content and strategy. He noted that Walmart is not opposed to the minimum wage law - which we can discuss when we are all on a call after reviewing the draft response. Later that day former Walmart exec Dach chimed in, suggesting that the letter from Nader et al might not merit a response -- and that perhaps it wasn't wise for Hillary Clinton to remind people of her past Walmart ties. I think this particular letter can be ignored unless it comes back in a meaningful way. His ongoing attacks on HRC delegitimize his voice, and it's already pretty marginalized. If you eventually need to answer u could simply say that your position on raising the minimum wage is clear to all businesses. You don't want to be tied or held responsible for any specific business, walmart for sure included. Branding Hillary In a Feb. 14, 2015 email from top Clinton campaign adviser Joel Benenson to various unspecfied members of Team Clinton, he expressed concerns about the Clinton logo that design firm Pentagram was working on. All, I have a nagging concern that was reinforced at the meeting on Wednesday and while it's not keeping me up at night I just want to share it with the three of you to address however you see fit. From the time the broader group was brought into the meeting at Pentagram there has been a concern about the static nature of the mark, the lack of action or anything suggesting forward movement etc. Each time we were told there would [be] some exploration in a new direction. We have had several calls along the way and the meeting this week where we thought we would see something in a new direction and we really haven't. To me, a new direction means a new concept something different from the idea of the "window," which is one concept but we really haven't been shown anything else. I don't think it's fair to compare things repeatedly to the Obama mark but I think the process -- or at least what's been written and said about its development, might be worth looking at again. The "O" because linked to an identify that was not only positive and suggestive, it was also reflective who Obama was and what he represented. There was a rising sun, a path or road both of which suggest movement. Apart from the design issues have raised, conceptually a window is two dimensional object and the core quality Pentagram is affixing to it (transparent, open) only get us to the use cases as Teddy says and not to the core qualities about H that we are trying drive and communicate. I would also like to press Michael to match what he said himself about Obama's mark/brand. Designer Michael Bierut [a link to a Wikipedia article was included here] called Obama's branding "just as good or better" as the best commercial brand designs. "Every time you look, all those signs are perfect," Beirut said. "Graphic designers like me don't understand how it's happening. It's unprecedented and inconceivable to us. The people in the know are flabbergasted." At this point, I think it would be wise to do one or both of the following: · Review the brief to assess whether we are or not asking them to execute against the right things (we now have research getting us closer to our core rationale, attributes etc.) · Ask Pentagram to develop something, perhaps with a different team, that is truly different from the territory we have already seen and possibly get 1 or 2 small firms to take a crack at this so we generate some healthy competition. This is not a knock on Michael or Pentagram, who are terrific in the world of corporate branding. But I think we're looking for something in the mark [that] can present the discipline of a corporate brand while creating the truly dynamic potential we want in a political mark. Wendy Clark was apparently one of the "All" Benenson was addressing, because she wrote back the same day, copying additional members of Team Clinton. (On Jan. 9, 2015, Ad Age reported that Clark, then Coca-Cola's top North American marketing executive, was taking a leave of absence "to pursue a 'passion project' that some sources indicate will involve working for likely presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.") Joel, Thanks for taking time to outline your thoughts. I have read them carefully and want to answer your questions and try to address some of your concerns. [This] makes for a long email, but I believe we're at that point. I've also added the rest of the team in here as our exchange may be helpful for everyone. As we outlined on Friday's team call, Teddy and I met with Pentagram on Friday right before the 9am call and confirmed 3 streams of work that they have been looking at for the last 24-36 hours. They are: 1. Hillary. -- we need to determine if there is a similar technique that addresses the inevitability that comes with the period. What everyone lights to is the design asset that the period provides and can be applied to other words with and without Hillary. However what does not work is the implied emphasis of a period itself. There is no debate on what the core mark would be on this route if there's another option for the period. 2. H Window -- while there's lots of positive reaction for this direction there's also more to do in terms of getting the team and the Secretary comfortable to go on this. In her feedback on our call her language of "embracing people, embracing our problems and embracing our future" was really helpful along with "reaching outwards to inspire upwards." How do we imbue this approach with an even stronger sense of her passion and motivation behind doing the job? She leans away from Hillary type or Hillary signature, she's unwilling for this to be so focused on her. While we will maintain this as something to consider, per Mandy and Jim's input on the Friday call, we are seeking other solutions. So the core mark has to work harder to her mission and/or attributes. The other thing we need to add to this is the contextual relevance of a tagline and/or words as was displayed on the Hillary. approach. That combination of words and design consistency really compels everyone. How would we introduce words and/or a tagline within the design route of the H Window? 3. Something else -- the ideas that have been surfaced on H+You, &, + sign, Together, Us, the President's # idea and the Secretary's language outlined above need to be explored outside the constraints of the two existing directions. I think the watch out here is to not get too clever or too cutesy with symbols. You will see options within all three routes on our call tomorrow. On the design brief, we've been working against the version we all emailed and socialized 3 weeks ago and a distillation of the core idea and qualities/attributes was finalized on a call you, Mandy and I had. I recognize there's new insight since then, if there are core attributes that the design should represent beyond the current brief that would be important to agree on. In the meeting last week the Secretary seemed to associate with what we had identified: fresh yet familiar, tenacity, resilience, empathy, creativity, action-oriented, future focused. As to the Obama parallel, we've discussed in the presentations that Obama's campaign execution truly represented a turning point for political branding in presidential campaigns -- they in fact used what many would say were widely accepted brand techniques that companies outside politics historically use -- contemporary colors and iconography, dynamic composition in the mark, the mark to represent truths of the brand, etc. We all observed in the political campaigns before Obama it was largely typesetting with use of flag imagery, stars and photograph identity as the core design assets used. And this use of branding has a lot to do with why I believe I'm here. And why Pentagram and Michael Beirut are here. As you point out on Michael's quote below, the Obama visual identity changed how the design and branding community considered political brands. This benchmark sets the stage for a much more branded execution for Secretary Clinton, and quite frankly a fairly high expectation of a branded execution. But at its core, great branding must always reflect the unassailable truths of the brand. And the best, most compelling brands in the world are singular and relentless in their quest to do just this. We have a gift in the Hillary Rodham Clinton brand because of massive recognition/awareness. Obama did not start with this. At the same time we must create a new, fresh view of that familiar brand in a truly authentic and compelling way. To be clear, a logo can communicate and aid attribution of qualities, but it is not a proxy for the messaging of the campaign until they are relentlessly connected and delivered, repeatedly and consistently. That's when brands take on meaning. As Michael has used previously, no one would look at a red Target logo and think: design for all -- fashionable yet affordable choices for my home and family -- expect more, pay less. But their relentless, contemporary, fashion-forward products and aligned messaging has imbued that logo with meaning just that. Similarly, Apple, the world's most valuable brand, launched with their rainbow apple mark in 1976. It simply stood for creativity, thinking differently. Their repeated, consistent use of the mark along with some of the world's most creative advertising has imbued that bitten apple logo with meaning but no one would look at that mark standalone and say it means Apple is the leader in human-centered designed, electronic devices with a vision for the future. And non-corporate examples are similarly rich in learnings. The Human Rights Campaign simply uses the equality sign. It's compelling, simple and speaks to their core -- being a relentless champion of equal rights for humanity. There are plenty of other attributes that are associated with HRC, but equality is their unassailable brand truth. So, here's the point. We want to create a visual representation for Secretary Clinton that is equally as compelling, interesting, exciting and inviting as Obama's mark was eight years ago. And to use techniques that some of the best brands have done and continue to do around the world. And again, the mark is simply one aspect of a bevy of connection points (messaging, speeches, PR, advertising, web, etc.) And this leads me to explain, if I've failed to so far, why the H window approach is so compelling to us. This approach will represent in 2015 what the Obama approach represented in 2007. It literally resets the benchmark for political branding, if not all branding. It is of and for the times leveraging the massive and important shift to customization, personalization and co-creation. And, more importantly, while meeting this marketplace shift the mark is, at the same time, anchored on the unassailable truth of Secretary Clinton's life and career -- being in service of others. It's not about her, it's about you. It also meets our brief of fresh yet familiar, it shows creativity and empathy. Now, we have work to do. While this direction is immediately compelling and will fuel advocacy from her fans and drive conversation and content around and for the campaign, we have yet to effectively land its core manifestation. And while we're likely to use it in numerous variations and iterations as it is so flexible to do, we have to have an anchoring point. And in honesty we've struggled to land that core mark to everyone's confidence and liking. We'll share some more iterations tomorrow. One in particular introduces another attribute -- future-focus -- and a design asset like the period from option 1 that is interesting. But for this conversation, I don't want our relentless efforts to make the core mark work construed as being obstinate. It's simply that we believe this approach would be level-setting for the candidate and campaign and are determined to land the core mark so we can reap the benefits of this approach. Some final assurance, you will also see completely new exploration to get a sense of other approaches tomorrow and Michael/Pentagram has added two other senior partners into their effort to engage in the work, the limitation until now was set by us for confidentiality purposes. If you've read this far, I appreciate the chance to frame the opportunity, underscore our continued confidence and provide any clarity. A revised deck will be coming shortly. Thanks.

The Wal-Mart Foundation said it is allocating $500,000 specifically toward CARE and Team Rubicon Global for relief efforts in Haiti. In the United States, the retailer and the foundation have been working closely with the American Red Cross, Salvation Army, Team Rubicon and Feeding America. “Our thoughts are with those affected by this disaster,” Kathleen McLaughlin, president of the Wal-Mart Foundation, said in a statement. “Both Wal-Mart and the Wal-Mart Foundation are working closely with non-profit partners, first responders, elected officials and governmental organizations to see how each can use its strengths to help.” In the last 10 years, Wal-Mart and the Wal-Mart Foundation have donated more than $56 million in cash and in-kind donations in response to disaster events. Sears overhauls five stores in Missouri Five Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores in Missouri will be among those that will hold grand "reopening" ceremonies today and Saturday as they unveil new products, redesigned merchandising, new signage and other changes. The stores include those in Cassville and Nevada as well as Ava, Rolla and West Plains. “We’ve given our stores a facelift that will completely change the appliance shopping experience in these communities,” Jeff McDowell, a district manager of Sears Hometown Stores in Missouri, said in a statement. “The changes made to our retail strategy, from increased training for our sales staff to more integration of products available in-store and online, have brought even more value to customers shopping for the perfect appliance to fit their needs.” A new floor plan also includes the ability to showcase complete kitchen packages through the addition of three kitchen vignettes. The retailer began updating its stores in 2015. Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores focuses on selling home appliances, lawn and garden equipment, tools and hardware. As of July 30, Sears Hometown and Outlet Stores and its dealers and franchisees operated 1,123 stores across all 50 states as well as in Puerto Rico and Bermuda. Bass Pro CEO says discusses merger impact (AP) Bass Pro Shops' CEO Johnny Morris recently told Cabela's employees in Sydney, Nebraska, that he won't plant false hopes about their jobs after he completes the purchase of the company. But he repeated earlier statements that some operations will stay in the Nebraska town where Cabela's was founded. About 2,000 Cabela's employees work at the Sidney, Nebraska, headquarters; the headquarters of the combined company after the acquisition is complete will be in Springfield, Missouri. Morris told about 250 Cabela's employees at a Sidney meeting Tuesday that there will be some "slimming down" because of function duplication. Morris said without details that "important, significant jobs" will remain in Sidney. A Cabela's representative didn't immediately return a call from The Associated Press. The company also has committed to keeping open Cabela's Nebraska call centers in Grand Island, Kearney and North Platte, but Bass Pro spokesman Jack Wlezien said Wednesday that he couldn't yet say whether there will be any employee cutbacks. As for the Sidney staffing, Wlezien said, "We don't have an exact forecast yet." We have recently upgraded our commenting system.

(WMT) Has a Tougher Road Ahead Than You Think WMT stock rolls over as easy work is done By Dana Blankenhorn, InvestorPlace Contributor  |  Oct 10, 2016, 11:25 am EST     Popular Posts: Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Has a New Path to Bigger Profits Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (VRX) Stock Enters ‘Survivor Mode’ CVS Health Corp (CVS) Stock Is a Black-and-Blue Buy Now Recent Posts: ESPN Strangles Walt Disney Co (DIS) Stock AGAIN Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) Has a New Path to Bigger Profits Kohl’s Corporation (KSS) Stock Is Shopped Back to Life View All Posts Early this year, I called Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) the “McDonald’s of 2016,”  comparing what might be happening there to the turnaround at McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD) under new CEO Steve Easterbrook. In fact, since January Walmart stock is up 11%. But it was up over 20% for the year in August — this was my point back then. Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr I felt Easterbrook had just done the easy things, like making breakfast all day, and that gains from there would be harder. McDonald’s stock is down 3% during 2016. Once investors realized that McDonald’s problems were structural, not superficial, they walked away from the shares. That is happening to WMT stock, and for the same reason. The problems at WMT go deep, and they won’t be fixed quickly. Management recognizes this, but that doesn’t make it comforting if you have money that wants a return now. Structural Problems for WMT Walmart’s suburban-style SuperCenter store format has reached market saturation in the U.S. At its investor meeting on Oct. 6, CEO Doug McMillon said the company would slow domestic store openings, and crack down on incidental expenses like travel, focusing instead on store operations. 7 Huge Swing Trades to Make for the Fourth Quarter WMT also has a demographic problem. The average shopper is 51, and about half earn under $50,000 per year. This is five years older, with $13,000 less in income, than the average at long-time rival Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT). Walmart shoppers are also less likely to be black or Hispanic than shoppers at rival stores, another troubling demographic sign. Analyst Ken Goldberg wrote recently that Walmart stock has been flashing technical “sell” signals for a month and speculators are heading for the exits. He wonders whether this is a WMT problem or a general economic malaise setting in. It’s a Walmart problem. With sales approaching $500 billion per year, WMT is a huge ship to turn around. It is still being haunted by a foreign bribery case resulting from its entry into Mexico, and recently rejected a settlement of that case.  Walmart is a company haunted by its past. Walmart Stock Has Strengths WMT is becoming huge in the grocery space. This gives it an advantage over Target, but that company is no longer its target. And it has taken Walmart many years of concentrated effort, preceding McMillon’s tenure as CEO, to achieve this goal. Now McMillon thinks WMT should be taking on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). This is why it recently bought Jet.com for $3 billion in cash, plus $300 million in stock incentives. As Jet executives take control over Walmart’s e-commerce operations, results may improve. The problem is that, right now, WMT’s online operations don’t even beat Target, let alone Amazon. Delivery is slower, and less accurate, than from its smaller rival. A Qualcomm, Inc. (QCOM), NXP Semiconductors NV (NXPI) Merger Is a No-Brainer Walmart, in other words, has a long way to go to catch up as an e-retailer, and low prices alone won’t make up the gap. It has deep structural, operational issues that must be addressed, at scale, before it can begin to fulfill its promises. Bottom Line on WMT Stock McMillon warned two years ago that his turnaround would take time and he has been right. He has taken on Walmart’s reputation for poor pay, and those initiatives have proven enough of a success that he could brag about it in a commercial. But giving checkers a small raise is a bit like making breakfast all day. It can provide a short-term boost to WMT stock’s earnings, allowing the people who work at the company to shop there. But it does not solve the underlying structural problems — demographic, operational or cultural — that still bedevil the company nearly three years into McMillon’s tenure. As with Easterbrook’s McDonald’s, you’re going to want to avoid Walmart stock until you see real progress on these structural issues.

Cho, The Plain Dealer The Plain Dealer Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 13, 2016 at 5:00 AM, updated October 13, 2016 at 5:03 AM comments CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Walmart stores nationwide are hosting free health checks on Saturday afternoon, Oct. 15, at all 4,600-plus U.S. stores as part of the retailer's second Walmart Wellness Day. From noon to 4 p.m., stores will offer free blood glucose and blood pressure tests, vision screenings (only at stores with vision centers), product samples, and information on healthcare insurance. No appointments are necessary; services are first-come, first-served. More than 10,000 licensed pharmacists will be offering immunizations at all Walmart pharmacies, including: flu shots, chicken pox, Hepatitis A and B, HPV, meningitis, MMR, pneumonia, shingles, and TDAP. For customers without insurance, flu shots will cost $25. At last year's event, Walmart said it conducted more than 280,000 blood pressure, glucose, and vision screenings, administered nearly 52,000 immunizations, and gave away more than 2 million samples of healthier food. The companies giving out samples this year include: GoJo, Pfizer, U.S. Nutrition, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Clorox, Kleenex, Dannon, Kellogg's, Mars, and Vega. Of those who received blood glucose screenings last year, nearly 3,000 were advised to consult a health care professional based on their readings. Walmart said it also detected high blood pressure readings in more than 7,000 people, including one unidentified woman whose readings "were so alarming that she went immediately to the emergency room where she was treated for a hypertensive emergency." "As more than 90 percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store, we're committed and uniquely positioned to provide accessible and affordable healthcare that helps busy families live better," said George Riedl, senior vice president and president of health and wellness for Walmart U.S., in a statement. "These screenings provide customers with a basic yet vital understanding of their general health conditions and ways to improve them." In addition to bringing customers into the stores, the event also promotes Walmart's merchandise and its relationship with DirectHealth.com, which helps people compare their coverage and enroll in a healthcare plan. "We have many of the products customers need to start or continue their journey to a healthy lifestyle such as fresh produce, apparel, exercise equipment, and wearable technology," Riedl said. Walmart, the world's largest retailer and Ohio's largest employer, reported revenues of $482.1 billion for the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31, 2016. It operates 11,527 stores in 28 countries. More information about the event is at Walmart.com/healthcare or at the stores on Saturday.

October 13, 2016 Wal-Mart nearly doubled its investment in Chinese e-commerce platform JD.com and its shareholding scale increased from 5.9% to 10.8%. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart gained an observer role for board of directors meeting of JD.com, which plays second-fiddle to behemoth Alibaba in China. The latest files submitted by Wal-Mart to the regulatory authorities revealed the information, which reflects the importance of the alliance with JD for Wal-Mart's long-term development in China. In June 2016, this U.S.-headquartered retail giant sold its Chinese e-commerce business Yhd to JD. As a part of this deal, Wal-Mart held about 5.9% shares of JD. Basing on this agreement, Wal-Mart also has the rights to increase shareholding of JD and gain the observer role. Wal-Mart started investment in Yhd in May 2011 and the company gained a 17.7% stake with the initial investment. In July 2015, Wal-Mart acquired Yhd entirely. However, the international retailer decided to give up Yhd in June 2016; instead, it started in-depth cooperation with JD. JD's only major strategic partner is Tencent, which has one position in the board of directors of JD.

Crowley Updated 10:18 pm, Friday, October 14, 2016 Image 1of/1 Caption Close Image 1 of 1 Thomas Smith Thomas Smith Police: Albany officers' actions in shooting followed law 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Albany The city police department cleared two officers involved in shooting out the car window of an alleged bank robber, a man who had gained national attention earlier this year when he was fired from Wal-Mart. On Sept. 14, Detective Robert Lawyer and Detective Sgt. Patrick Donnelly were trying to arrest Thomas Smith, 53, of Albany, on Green Street. Smith allegedly backed his car toward Lawyer, who opened fire, according to police. The gunshot blew out the window of Smith's car, but he was not seriously injured. Police conducted an internal investigation and found Donnelly and Lawyer's actions "were within the policy of the Albany Police Department and in accordance with the law." An Albany rights activist, however, says the report is short on detail. Smith was in the news in November after he was fired from his job at Wal-Mart for redeeming $2 in empty cans left unclaimed outside the store. Smith said he was never told he could not take unclaimed cans, but Wal-Mart officials said it was theft. A GoFundMe crowdfunding campaign raised more than $21,000 for him. Smith was on parole for a 2002 robbery of a KeyBank branch in Latham and had served more than 13 years of a 15-year sentence before he was released last year on parole.

On Wednesday, September 14, 2016 at approximately 1:00 p.m., Albany police Detective Sergeant Patrick Donnelly and Detective Robert Lawyer observed Thomas Smith, 53 of Albany, inside of a vehicle on the 200 block of Green Street and attempted to take Smith into custody in connection with four separate bank robberies that occurred in the City of Albany between July 29th and September 12th, 2016. Smith became the suspect in the robberies following a thorough investigation by Albany police detectives who followed up on several leads using surveillance footage, gathered evidence and obtained information from witnesses. On Wednesday, September 14, at 12:56 p.m., detectives received information that Smith's vehicle was traveling on South Pearl Street and shortly thereafter, observed the vehicle heading southbound. As Smith stopped his vehicle on the 200 block of Green Street, detectives exited their vehicle and attempted to effect Smith's arrest for the four robberies. As Detective Lawyer was approaching Smith's vehicle from the rear, Smith, who was still in the driver's seat, accelerated his vehicle in reverse towards Detective Lawyer. Believing his life was in danger Detective Lawyer fired a single shot ceasing Smith's actions. Smith was subsequently taken into custody. He was not shot or injured during the incident. The investigation has found that Detective Sergeant Donnelly and Detective Lawyer's actions were within policy of the Albany Police Department and in accordance with the law. Albany police suspected him of four recent bank robberies in the city between July 29 and Sept. 12. The case is still pending and Smith remains in jail. On the day he was arrested, Smith said he was parking his car. Smith made almost daily visits to employees at The Center for Law and Justice on Green Street who had helped him during his dispute with Wal-Mart. "I was backing up and this guy just popped out and I heard boom and the window blew out," Smith told the Times Union in an interview from jail in September. "Thank God the bullet missed the back of my head." During the jail house interview, Smith said he started using drugs again recently after a fight with his father sent him into a depression. He maintained his innocence, but he acknowledged that he used some of the money raised during the Wal-Mart dispute on drugs. The police press release said the detectives had received information that Smith was in the area and saw him stop on Green Street. The detectives left their vehicle and tried to arrest Smith, according to the statement. "As Detective Lawyer was approaching Smith's vehicle from the rear, Smith, who was still in the driver's seat, accelerated his vehicle in reverse towards Detective Lawyer. Believing his life was in danger Detective Lawyer fired a single shot ceasing Smith's actions," the statement said. The shooting happened on the same block as the justice center. Alice Green, executive director of the justice center, said police statement on the shooting provided little detail on how the officers tried to arrest Smith. Witnesses told Green that the officers were in plain clothes and driving an unmarked car, so it was unclear how Smith would know they were police. "If the police officer was not in uniform, if the police officer was in an unmarked car, people don't understand why police thought he was trying to run him down," Green said. "It doesn't provide the community with enough information about the incident and why it was necessary to fire the shot. We are just thankful that no one was hurt or killed." ccrowley@timesunion.com • 518-454-5348 • @townstu • http://facebook.com/cathleenFcrowley Today's Deals Powered by SHOP NOW Eastwood Rust Encapsulator 15-oz.

Teams of investigators from the Jefferson County Regional Financial Crimes Task Force, which is headed by the office of District Attorney Brandon Falls and the U.S. Secret Service, fanned out Friday morning armed with search and arrest warrants at the businesses, which serve as pawn shops and provide payday loans and check cashing. The Financial Crimes Task Force includes Vestavia Hills, Birmingham and Mountain Brook police, the U.S. Postal Service, Walmart and Target. Pelham police and the Shelby County District Attorney's Office also took part in today's arrests. At 10 a.m., officers descended on stores in Jefferson and Shelby counties, handcuffing employees and seizing dozens of boxes of business records and stolen goods. "The investigation uncovered organized retail theft and purchasing of stolen property that reached into the hundreds of thousands of dollars,'' Falls said. Jefferson County District Attorney Investigator Chris Clark and Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Raulston said the investigation began about three months ago when retailers realized hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of merchandise was being boosted off the shelves. Fitbits, iPads and other "smart products" were disappearing from Walmart, Target, CVS, Walgreen's and Home Depot. Investigators from those stores teamed up with federal and Jefferson County authorities to launch Operation Get Fit, which culminated in today's roundup. What they found was the stolen items being sold to the dozen of stores owned by Shelby County resident and business owner Steve Scott. Scott's home, as well as 12 of his businesses were hit Friday. Vestavia Hllls police Capt. Kevin York said the retailers provided undercover officers with goods to present as stolen to the businesses owned by Scott. "The new, in-the-box property was presented as stolen,'' York said. "The clerks knew it was stolen when they took it in." "Fitbits is what got it started but I saw a little bit of everything,'' he said. "This is a big operation. It's a million-dollar business." As of 4:30 p.m., investigators were only halfway through inventory on the stolen items recovered today, and said they've already documented a half-million worth of fenced goods. The businesses raided were: Cash 101, 3183 Pelham Pkwy.; Check Exchange, 1415 Pinson Valley Pkwy.; Cash Plus, 615 19th St. North, Bessemer; Cash Max, 3569 Pelham Pkwy.; Check Exchange, 9541 Parkway East; Cash Max,  Allison-Bonnett Memorial Drive, Hueytown; Cash Max, 1205 Ashville Road, Montevallo; Check Exchange, 1240 Forestdale Blvd.; Cash Max, 602 Springville Road; Scott's Jewelry and Pawn, 4673 U.S. 280; Cash Max, 825 9th Ave. North, Bessemer, and Scott's Jewelry and Pawn, 608 Springville Road. Those arrested face felony charges ranging from theft to receiving stolen property. They are: Steve Scott, 58; Shannon Norwood, 46; Cynthia Graves, 38; Taylor McMonigal, 27; Latonya Graham, 38; Tara Vincent Tate, 34; Sheila Kennebrew, 51; Tamika Williams, 39; Serena Parker Garrett, 34; April England, 36; Talitha Warren, 34; Latonya Jack, 31; Nathalie Alarcon, 26; Atasha Beam, 31; Cody McBride, 32; and Sarah Vickers, 38. Falls said he is pleased his office could be a part of the investigation. "This is a great example of cooperation between police departments, federal agencies, private businesses and what they can accomplish together,'' he said. Investigators spent all day collecting and documenting evidence. York said the public can expect to see more investigations like Operation Get Fit. "It hurts everybody because the retailer passes the losses on to the buyers,'' he said. "They have to make up for what they've lost, and that causes everybody to pay more. That affects you, me, everybody."   Most Read Active Discussions About Us About Alabama Media Group Jobs at Alabama Media Group Advertise with us News In Education Frequently Asked Questions About AL.com Contact Us Online Store Already a Subscriber?

Pulaski County Sheriff’s Office Lt. D.R. Johnson said the department responded to the store at 2:45 p.m. after a Walmart employee found the message. As was the case Oct. 4, management had already evacuated the store when deputies arrived on the scene. Virginia State Police, Blacksburg Police Department and Virginia Tech Police Department responded with K-9 units to sweep the stores for explosives, but nothing was found. The store was able to resume operations around 6 p.m. Both threats are being investigated by the sheriff’s office. Johnson expressed gratitude to the assisting law enforcement departments, as well Dublin Fire Department. Written by: Editor on October 14, 2016.

RELATED: Texas man who allegedly hid meth in ear smiles in mugshot A woman who is nine months pregnant and her husband were shopping for a baby crib at the location when a young man with a beard approached them in the parking lot and said “something to the effect of ‘give me all the money or I’ll shoot you,’” according to the affidavit. The suspect lifted his shirt to expose a handgun and the woman’s husband yelled at the man, prompting the suspect to flee the scene. Police obtained surveillance video from both locations and were able to collect images of the suspect and the vehicle he was driving, which were released to local media. Investigators received a call from a woman who believed her son, later identified as Zarate, was the suspect in the two alleged attempted robberies. Police said Zarate admitted to using a BB gun during the crimes, which was obtained as evidence in the case. The gun was a black Umarex 40 XP carbon dioxide airgun, the affidavit said. RELATED: Knife fight in downtown S.A. lands 2 men in hospital Police also learned that Zarate had taken his mother’s silver Kia minivan throughout that weekend the robberies occurred. Investigators were able to obtain the clothes he allegedly wore during the robberies, as well, according to the affidavit.

If convicted, Zarate faces five to 99 years or life in prison for each charge.

More Comments Tumblr Pinterest Reddit Digg FarkIt StumbleUpon The true cost of Brexit hit home for U.K. shoppers as Unilever’s iconic Marmite spread and a host of other products remained absent from Tesco Plc’s online store Thursday because of a standoff over price increases triggered by the Brexit vote. Britain’s biggest supermarket chain said Wednesday that it’s “currently experiencing availability issues on a number of Unilever products,” and aims to have the matter resolved soon. Unilever, which reported a decline in third-quarter sales volumes Thursday, told analysts that it was “confident” the issue would be resolved quickly, noting that the U.K. accounts for just 5 per cent of its business. The dispute lays bare the close ties between Tesco and its third-largest supplier, which produces household brands like Hellmann’s mayonnaise and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream and was Tesco Chief Executive Officer Dave Lewis’s longtime employer. Unilever, along with other consumer-product makers like Nestle SA, is facing heightened sourcing costs from a plunge in the pound since the June vote to leave the European Union, yet passing those expenses along to retailers will be difficult with U.K. grocers already locked in fierce competition. “Tough price negotiations are a constant factor of the relationship between food manufacturers and retailers, and are going to be very tough in the U.K. following the Brexit vote,” Andrew Wood, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a note. “But they rarely break out in public or lead to de-stocking of manufacturer products.” Top customers Tesco is Unilever’s third-biggest customer after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Kroger Co., accounting for 2.3 per cent of its revenue, according to Bloomberg data. The Guardian newspaper has reported that Unilever wants to raise prices by about 10 per cent because of the fall in sterling. Among Unilever’s brands to exit the Tesco web store were Persil detergent, Flora margarine and more than 100 products in the Dove range of body care. A check of Tesco.com Thursday morning showed the products were still unavailable. “Retailers’ margins are already squeezed,” Justin King, former CEO of J Sainsbury Plc, said at an event hosted by Bloomberg in London on Wednesday. “So there is no room to absorb input price pressures and costs will need to be passed on.” The Brexit vote has affected pricing of products ranging from floor coverings to toilet paper. Unilever was among companies that lobbied voters to remain in the European Union, while supermarkets including Tesco took a more neutral stance ahead of the vote in a bid not to alienate either faction of consumers. Sainsbury and Wm. Morrison Supermarkets Plc declined to comment on their relationships with Unilever. Wal-Mart’s Asda unit did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “The question is whether Sainsbury, Asda, Waitrose and others are taking it on the chin or if they will play hardball too,” Alan Clarke, an economist at Scotiabank in London, said in a note. “What about other suppliers — Unilever is probably not a one-off trying to pass on higher input costs.” Chocolate, cheese Food companies such as KitKat maker Nestle and Swiss dairy concern Emmi AG have both said they will look to raise prices in the U.K. to respond to the plunge in sterling. Nestle is due to report third-quarter sales Oct. 20. “The margin in the U.K. will be lower next year than this year or last year, that’s for sure,” Emmi Chief Executive Officer Urs Riedener said on Oct. 6. “We’re obliged to push price increases in most of the segments.” Any dispute between Tesco and Unilever would be particularly touchy for Lewis, the Unilever veteran. Tesco has sought to improve relations with its vendors in the wake of an accounting scandal and criticism from a grocery industry regulator. The tussle also risks damaging Unilever’s reputation as a good corporate citizen, an image that Chief Executive Officer Paul Polman has sought to enhance in recent years. “This sort of standoff benefits no one,” said Bryan Roberts, an analyst at researcher TCC Global. “Unilever will lose market share by not being in Tesco, and shoppers will feel a huge degree of frustration. A speedy resolution would be in everyone’s best interests.” Find Financial Post on Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Typo?

The child was at Wal-Mart in Clayton around 8:20 p.m. when she stopped breathing.  Johnston County EMS responded to the Wal-Mart parking lot for a report of the child having a medical emergency.  On the scene they found the young girl not breathing. Paramedics worked for more than an hour trying to save the little girl’s life without success. No foul play is suspected but Clayton Police are investigating. Officials say they are awaiting toxicology reports as part of the investigation. Photos by John Payne Update (3:22pm Friday): In an email, Town of Clayton spokesperson Stacy Beard said the child may have had a previously existing medical issue.  The girl went into Wal-Mart with her family. Upon returning to their SUV her family noticed the child began having trouble breathing and called 911. Beard said there were no signs of neglect or foul play at the scene nor after an autopsy.  Clayton Police are still investigating the incident.  The child’s name has not been released.         Johnston County’s #1 Local News Source Email event information to Events@JoCoReport.com General Questions: Email our staff at Info@JoCoReport.com News Related Questions or Issues: Email our News Desk at News@JoCoReport.com Want to advertise with us?

SLIDE SHOW 10 States With the Scariest Death Taxes TOOL What Is My IRA Required Minimum Distribution? BUILDING WEALTH Kiplinger's Wealth Creation Web Conference Series Advertisement Medicare Guide to Medicare Open Enrollment for 2017 What retirees need to know about choosing Medicare Part D or Medicare Advantage plans for next year. Thinkstock By Kimberly Lankford, Contributing Editor From Kiplinger's Retirement Report, October 2016 Get ready to be bombarded with mailings and TV ads for Medicare plans. Open enrollment for Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage plans runs from October 15 to December 7, so this is your opportunity to reassess your coverage for 2017. Even if you're happy with your plan, you may be taking a new drug or your plan's coverage may have changed. New plans may have entered—or your plan may have left—the business in your area. Or you may want to try out Medicare Advantage, which provides both medical and drug coverage through a private insurer. SEE ALSO: 11 Common Medicare Mistakes Average monthly premiums for Part D prescription-drug plans are increasing slightly—from $32 this year to $34 in 2017—but that masks some of the bigger cost increases. As drug prices rise, insurers are trying to manage their costs by dropping some drugs from their formularies, which list covered drugs, or passing along a larger share of the cost to consumers. Such changes could make the plan that was your best deal this year a less-than-optimum plan next year. “Some people with multiple chronic conditions don’t want to upset the apple cart,” says Tatiana Fassieux, board chair of California Health Advocates and a longtime counselor with the state’s health insurance assistance program. “But this year, we’ve found the formularies have changed significantly, not just in what they cover but also in how much they charge.” You may need to pay 30% or more of the price of expensive specialty medications—or as much as 50% if you don’t use a certain pharmacy. “Some plans have been moving cancer drugs to a higher-cost pricing tier,” says Kirsten Sloan, senior policy director for the American Cancer Society. You may even have to pay a lot more for a few generic drugs, which can cost the same as brand-name drugs under some plans, says Fassieux. The bottom line: Your out-of-pocket costs could be vastly different depending on the plan you choose. You’ll get the first clues about changes to your plan’s cost and coverage in the plan’s Annual Notice of Change, which must be mailed in late September. Then you’ll be able to compare 2017 plans using the Medicare Plan Finder starting on October 1. Type in your zip code, drugs and dosages, and the tool calculates your total costs (premiums plus out-of-pocket costs for your drugs) for each plan in your area. The best plan for you may be different than it is for your spouse. Advertisement SEE ALSO: 5 Ways to Ease the Pain of Health Care Costs in Retirement Your state health insurance assistance program can provide personalized assistance—find local contacts at www.shiptacenter.org or by calling 800-633-4227. After narrowing your search based on total costs, dig deeper to find out about any restrictions on coverage for the drugs you need. To control costs, some plans limit access to expensive drugs. They may only cover the drug with “prior authorization,” requiring your doctor to explain why you need it. “Unlike health plans, Part D plans generally have no information about your health conditions,” says David Lipschutz, senior policy attorney for the Center for Medicare Advocacy. Or the plan may only cover an expensive drug if you’ve tried cheaper versions, called “step therapy.” There may be limits on the quantity you can receive of a certain drug—even if you’ve been taking it for years. Most Part D plans now have preferred pharmacies that you’ll need to use to get the lowest out-of-pocket price. For 2016, the Humana Walmart Part D plan, for example, charges a $1 co-pay for generic drugs on its preferred list if purchased at Walmart or Sam’s Club, and a $0 co-pay through the Humana mail-order pharmacy, but a $10 co-pay at other pharmacies. For brand-name drugs not on its preferred list, you’d pay 35% of the cost at Walmart, Sam’s Club or the Humana pharmacy, but you’d pay 45% to 50% at other pharmacies. (The 2017 plan details will be available in October.) “We’ve talked to people in rural areas who have to travel 50 miles or farther to find a preferred pharmacy,” says Fassieux. Preferred pharmacies can change from year to year—Walgreens, for example, was added as a preferred pharmacy to some large plans last year. Advertisement The “doughnut hole” coverage gap is changing slightly. For 2017, after a deductible of up to $400, you’ll just be responsible for co-payments until your drug costs reach $3,700 (including both your share and the insurer’s share of the costs). Once in the doughnut hole, you’ll have to pay 40% of the cost of brand-name drugs and 51% of the cost of generic drugs yourself. TAKE OUR QUIZ: Making Sense of Medicare After your out-of-pocket costs reach $4,950 (including the 50% brand-name discount paid by the drug manufacturer), you’ll pay only 5% of the drug costs. Comparing Medicare Advantage Plans If you have a Medicare Advantage plan or are considering switching to one from traditional Medicare, this is also the time to compare options for 2017. The average premiums have been about $37 per month for the past several years, and some plans charge $0 on top of your Medicare Part B premiums. The plans with the lowest premiums generally have smaller provider networks. Compare costs and coverage for every plan in your area by going to Medicare.gov/find-a-plan and clicking on “Medicare Health Plans.” Type in your drugs, dosages and general health condition to estimate your total costs under each plan. Check the plan’s star ratings for customer service, and find out how the plan covers any care you typically receive, as well as the cost sharing for hospital stays and surgery. Advertisement Compare each plan’s maximum out-of-pocket costs, which must be $6,700 or less in 2017. “In competitive markets, you might see plans with $2,400 maximum out-of-pocket costs,” says Alan Mittermaier, president of HealthMetrix Research, which analyzes Medicare Advantage plans based on out-of-pocket costs for people in good, fair and poor health. Check out www.medicarenewswatch.com in October for the 2017 results. Ask your doctor or contact the plan to find out whether your doctors, specialists and the hospital you prefer will be covered in 2017. Find out what happens if you use a doctor that isn’t included—some plans charge a higher co-payment, while others don’t cover out-of-network providers or facilities at all. SEE ALSO: 7 Ways to Save on Prescriptions During open enrollment, you can also switch from traditional Medicare to a Medicare Advantage plan. But if you decide to return to traditional Medicare after more than 12 months in a Medicare Advantage plan, medigap insurers can deny coverage or charge you more because of your health. Find out whether your state has any special open enrollment period. For more information, see The Attraction of Advantage Plans.

Young will be appearing at the Vancouver Writers Fest in October 2016. [PNG Merlin Archive] PNG Share Adjust Comment Print The Two of Us Kathy Page Biblioasis            Teardown Clea Young Freehand  Word is, the publishing industry (a business sector conscious of market demand) doesn’t invest much in, or encourage, short story collections. Alice Munro-like exceptions exist, of course, but — word is — that literary genre is regarded as a money pit. In a Walmart world, apparently, any volume of short stories is artisanal, a hand-crafted labour of love: those who seek it out will cherish it, but the majority of fiction readers desire the engagement or satisfaction or dollar value that only novel-length storytelling is thought to bring. Based on the evidence of Kathy Page’s The Two of Us and Clea Young’s Teardown, though, someone’s mistaken. These collections, 28 stories representing untold hours of art-making effort on their authors’ parts, invite us into captivating worlds. In ten-page allotments, admittedly, but still. Technically accomplished, they’re immersive, emotionally involving (the proverbial laughter through tears), and insightful. If you’re a short story reader already, here’s another pair to seriously consider. If you’re not, maybe considering giving them a taste. They’re way more satisfying than kale. For The Two of Us Salt Spring Island resident Kathy Page selected pieces that focus on pairs. Psychologically rich and cinematic in the best way, they showcase Page’s range of interests, clever setting choice, and singular eye. Usually taking place in the U.K. (where Page once resided), the stories capture assorted moments in time. For instance, just four pages, “Johanna” features the reminiscences of a man whose philosophy decades earlier had been “love often” and “don’t count on me.” Settled now, he wonders if he’d want to meet one of the children he sired. Not quite two pages, “Daddy” relates just an instant in the day of a girl who is about to begin a caving adventure with her father. Some stories envision intersecting strangers. A lovely scenario, “The Last Cut” portrays a hairdresser shaving the head of a last-minute client, a woman with cancer who then asks for his help in choosing the perfect hat. Page often examines familial and romantic relationships. “The Perfect Day” follows shifting allegiances between interchanging pairs: a daughter taking her ailing elderly father to a historical landmark with her waspish mother in tow. Her vow — “I intend to keep smiling and move on through the kind of day I want us all to have” — proves difficult to uphold. That story twins with “The House on Manor Close” and “Dear Son,” where the subtle tensions and evolved dynamics of adult children with elderly parents are portrayed with both humour and finesse. Showcasing lovers — squatters; worried expectant parents with problem DNA; former friends with benefits; an obese couple struggling with prejudice; and a marriage on the verge — Page hints at the myriad possible trajectories any romance might take. Altogether Page offers a master class in fun with numbers, in this case two. She has been longlisted for the Scotiabank Giller Prize for this collection.  From first (“Teardown”) to last (“Firestorm”), the dozen witty stories of Clea Young’s debut collection are compelling snapshots: you want to look and then look at them once again. Like Page, Vancouver’s Young pays close attention to relationships — unsettled, post-honeymoon marital ones, in particular. Beginning with “No sex drive, post baby, body image issues (what the hell happened to her breasts)?,” “New World” is characteristic. The basic compulsion — to end a sexual dry spell and return to an earlier and more vital incarnation of coupledom — is confounded by the very changes that time’s passage has brought to the relationship. And reclaiming youth is a costly venture. Young dwells productively on the senses of loss, as in “What have we become?” and “Where’s the dynamo I used to be — before the baby, the long haul relationship, the daily grind years?” “What have we become?” and naive “We’ll ever become like them” moments pervade many of the stories, and Young’s incisive comic take on that commonly felt circumstance can be laugh aloud funny even when the undercurrent is sad or lamenting. And with children a reality or a subject for earnest debate, the tensions and “Is that all there is?” realizations mount. Ruined breasts (which appear again in “Dock Day”) are only one symptom of the larger universal malaise called Love and Marriage. A couple wandering IKEA and another one on a road trip to an undesired but obligatory wedding (while facing an infidelity-and-retaliation crisis) resound because their entanglements are so, well, relatable. Young’s stories don’t veer too far from that comfort zone, but inside it they reflect the skill and assuredness of a seasoned pro. And when she does let loose, though, as with a tale of unhinged waitresses and a sleazy boss (in “Lamb”) or a edge-of-surreal encounter on a ferry (like many of the stories, “Juvenile” is set on the west coast), she’s a capable provocateur. A talent to watch for, in other words. Young will be appearing at the Vancouver Writers Fest this month.  A lecturer at UBC, BJG’s the author of three novels, The Age of Cities, This Location of Unknown Possibilities, and From Up River and For One Night Only.

 Walmart only got 1 out of 10,000 teen votes for favorite shopping site, while Amazon got 40% Eugene Kim Oct. 14, 2016, 1:48 PM 2,410 facebook linkedin twitter email print Amazon is at the top of the mind for the teenage "Generation Z" demographic, who are famously picky and fickle when it comes to what they shop for. According to a new survey by financial firm Piper Jaffray, which asked 10,000 US teens, Amazon continued to be the #1 "preferred website" for online shopping, accounting for 40% of the responses. That's largely unchanged from previous surveys, as Amazon received 41%, 38%, and 36% of the responses in the past 3 semi-annual surveys, respectively. PiperJaffray Perhaps what's more impressive is that eBay is the only other non-apparel retailer in the top 10, while Target only got 6 votes and Walmart one single vote out of the 10,000 survey respondents. "For context, mindshare in our Taking Stock with Teens survey has historically not broken above the low 30% range for brands/retailers and, therefore, the fact that Amazon is maintaining at 40% mindshare is encouraging," PiperJaffray wrote in the note.

CNBC reported that salaries have gone from $47,476 to $48,000 for entry-level managers ahead of the rule from the Labor Department, which makes anyone earning up to $47,500 a year eligible for overtime pay. The salary cutoff now is $23,660. Wal-Mart did not say how many employees would receive the raise, which reportedly went into effect in September when the store paid more than $201 million in second-quarter bonuses to hourly employees after 99 percent of its stores met targets for cleanliness, faster checkout times and better service. The House passed legislation last month to delay the rule by six months to give businesses more time to adjust. A companion bill has also been introduced in the Senate. President Obama, however, has threatened to veto the bill. Meanwhile, lawsuits challenging the rule are piling up. Twenty-one states are suing the Labor Department, along with more than more than 55 Texas and national business groups. The business groups say the threshold is so high that salaried executive, administrative, professional and computer employees, whom Congress meant to keep exempt, now qualify.

CDT October 14, 2016 Anthony Zarate booking photo. (Photo: Austin Police Department) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST AUSTIN, TEXAS - The suspect in two robberies outside South Austin businesses has been arrested and charged after his mother recognized surveillance images of him and called police, an affidavit stated. According to the arrest affidavit, police have charged Anthony Zarate, 18, in connection to the Oct. 2 robberies outside a Slaughter Lane HEB and outside the Southpark Meadows Wal-Mart. APD noted in the affidavit that the robberies happened within one hour of each other and the locations were approximately two miles apart. The affidavit states officers were first called to the HEB parking lot around 1:40 p.m. Oct. 2 by a woman who was approached by a man in the parking lot. The woman told police that the man – later identified as Zarate – asked for her purse and lifted his shirt to expose a weapon when she told him no. Zarate allegedly walked away when she screamed for help and got on her phone to call police. Police were also called to the Southpark Meadows Wal-Mart around 2:20 p.m. for a service call, the affidavit said. The victim in this incident, who is nine months pregnant, told police that Zarate approached her and demanded money while showing a handgun tucked into his waistband. The woman’s husband approached Zarate from behind and yelled at him, and the affidavit stated he ran away. According to the affidavit, police reviewed surveillance video from the Wal-Mart and observed Zarate enter the store around 1:50 p.m. and leaving approximately 20 minutes later wearing a different shirt, jacket and pants. He was also seen on surveillance video walking back and forth in the parking lot before approaching someone. The two interacted for a brief period before returning to his silver minivan and fleeing the area. APD said they were contacted by the Travis County Sheriff’s Office on Oct. 11 after Zarate’s mother called to report she recognized the surveillance images distributed by the media as her son. Police searched Zarate’s room and seized several items of clothing consistent with what was seen on surveillance video, along with an airgun Anthony claimed was used in the Wal-Mart robbery. Police arrested the teen, who later commented “in the fear of the moment you would just assume it would be a real gun” to a detective during an interview. Zarate was booked into the Travis County Jail early Wednesday morning on two felony charges of aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. Online records show he is being held on combined $50,000 bond.

Most Popular Samsung is normally a perennial presence on the Viral Video Chart, which tracks paid and organic views in any given week through Sunday. But these are not normal times, with Samsung's Galaxy 7 a fire hazard and its production line shut down. Its washing machines are under suspicion, too. As a result, the marketer isn't spending money to make sure people see great Galaxy 7 ads, and its videos of Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard doing laundry have lost some of their charm. And so we present the fourth consecutive Viral Video Chart without any campaigns at all from Samsung, last seen here in early September after dominating in August. Into the void, among others, comes Google -- with a new smartphone to sell.

Urban League awarded $25K grant Angelia Davis , davisal@greenvilleonline.com 9:51 a.m. EDT October 14, 2016 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE The Urban League of the Upstate received a $25,000 grant to support of its Workforce Continuum of Care: Cast Preparation/Broadband Fiber Optic Training Program. The grant is from the Walmart Foundation’s State Giving program and the program the money will support helps Upstate residents develop career skills before they enter the workforce. The program offers national certifications based on the in-demand occupations established by the local workforce development board. These national certifications help pave the way for new employment opportunities for the underserved and create an entry into the global economy. “The majority of job openings in the future will require some sort of post-secondary credential, leaving behind many hourly workers, and it is our vision to help bridge this gap in an effort to create a thriving community where everyone has the opportunity to live, learn and work,"  said Jil Littlejohn, president and CEO of the Urban League of the Upstate. “Thanks to generous corporate donors like the Walmart Foundation, we are making significant strides in helping to eliminate barriers to employment for entry-level job seekers," Littlejohn said. “The Walmart Foundation is committed to assisting organizations like the Urban League that help people learn the skills they need to succeed in the workplace,” said Brooke Mueller, director of public affairs for Walmart. “We are proud to support the Urban League’s critical work, strengthening communities and creating career pathways in the Upstate.” In 2015, community giving in South Carolina from Walmart stores, clubs, and the Walmart Foundation totaled $30 million. ​“Thanks to generous corporate donors like the Walmart Foundation, we are making significant strides in helping to eliminate barriers to employment for entry-level job seekers,” Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/2ezLgaV TOP VIDEOS Most touching ways soldiers reunited with their family 1:17 Donald Trump's unlikely path to presidency 2:01 Man explains why he is poll watching at a Greenville County Precinct 0:42 Church Burned and Vandalized in Greenville 2:17 Todd Kohlhepp's neighbors relieved he's in custody 1:17 Family dog euthanized during search 1:58 Dad builds phenomenal costumes for his son 0:49 Christie's ex-aide invokes Fifth as office subpoenaed 1:06 Iconic 'National Geographic' 'Afghan Girl' arrested 0:41 Toxic metals found in kids' Halloween makeup 1:11 More Stories Paladins' Dirks makes most of first start Nov. 12, 2016, 9:33 p.m. Paladins pour it on against Catamounts Nov. 12, 2016, 9:12 p.m. Veterans Day Tribute at Upcountry History Museum Nov. 12, 2016, 8:23 p.m. Watson wanted win, not numbers Nov. 13, 2016, 9 a.m.

American Honey Going Out Film American Honey, film review: Forget Shia LaBeouf, Sasha Lane is the Star This is a movie with almost no plot beyond keeping on keeping on, says David Sexton, but Sasha Lane makes the film 4 David Sexton Friday 14 October 2016 09:04 BST We meet 18-year-old Star (luminous 21-year-old newcomer Sasha Lane) dumpster-diving in nowheresville, aka Muskogee, Oklahoma. A white van, pumping out music, full of raucous kids, drives by, parking in the local Walmart. Intrigued, Star goes into the store — and instantly forms a connection with their leader, rampant motormouth Jake (Shia LaBeouf at his most strutting yet — saying something, that). He jumps on to a checkout and, until security chuck him out, starts dancing to Calvin Harris and Rihanna’s We Found Love in a Hopeless Place. Star has. She’s hooked. Next day she joins this crew and they hit the road, first to Oklahoma City, then all over — Kansas City, Omaha and Grand Island in Nebraska, Rapid City, Williston and Pine Ridge. This crew of a dozen or so college-age kids are living in shared motel rooms, making a little money by selling magazine subscriptions, managed by Krystal, a dead-eyed, hard-bodied bitch in lurid skimpies (Riley Keough, 26, Elvis Presley’s eldest grandchild). For the next near three hours we follow these kids on the mother of all road trips, their hustling punctuated by dancing around fires, singing in the van, fighting, drinking, toking and fucking. This is a movie with almost no plot beyond keeping on keeping on — save that the exquisite focus of this film, Star, becomes hopelessly infatuated with Jake and caught up in a power-struggle over him with Krystal.  Leader of the pack: Shia LaBeouf “You think you’re special. You know I pay Jake girl money? $100 every time he finds a girl — and he fucks all of them too,” Krystal tells her. Star and Jake, both aggressive towards each other and yet fiercely attracted too, do have hot sex, in a convertible they’ve stolen, and on the grass outside a house the crew have commandeered. Briefly, they even dream of getting out of this life and buying a little place of their own (40 acres and a mule, the promise of General Sherman to freed slaves in 1865). But though each is furiously jealous of the other, their messy life on the road just carries on. There’s a fair bit of casual crime — theft from the houses of people unwise enough to let them in, people held up at gunpoint — but there are no consequences, and no police ever appear. Mostly they’re just happy, listening to loud and very offensively worded trap music (that’s Southern rap coming out of the trap of the drug lifestyle), doing drugs, drinking, letting off fireworks. The others on this crew look pretty extraordinary, totally wasted yet somehow still energetic, covered with tattoos and studs, mainly just very young, trapped in this sub-culture. But they are pretty thinly characterised. There’s a doomy girl called Pagan who obsesses about Darth Vader; there’s a guy who has a pet flying squirrel; there’s a dick who loves getting out his dick. They’re going nowhere but they have their team spirit, kept up by all these violently assertive, filthy-mouthed, thumping songs about sex, money, aggression and choices. American Honey: an exclusive report from the London Film Festival Gala Premiere Towards the end, they harmonise to the differently sentimental anthem American Honey by country and western outfit Lady Antebellum (“nothing’s sweeter than summertime/ and American honey”) and you think here at last is the film’s closure. But no — there’s another wild, drunken, druggy bonfire party and more crashing trap. It is to a large extent massively extended MTV — and your reaction depends largely on whether you care for this music. The director of this extreme American road trip, however, is British, Andrea Arnold (Wasp, Red Road, Fish Tank, Wuthering Heights). You might almost say a tourist then? In more than one sense. For although now 55, she remains not just concerned with life for those on the fringes of society, as in her previous work, but patently committed to being down with the kids. That’s ultimately what this film is about, what it is for, for those viewers who have proclaimed it one of their films of the year already: real — yet safely proxy — teen outsiderdom, rule-breaking, discovery and revelry. Arnold based this film, which she wrote as well as directed (although clearly much is improvised on a 2007 New York Times article, Door to Door: Long Days, Slim Rewards, about these travelling sales teams), so it has a factual basis, or it did back then. And she made it by scouting non-professional actors (12 or so out of the main cast) and taking them on the same road trip depicted in the film, living in cheap motels for two months and working with a minimal crew. They filmed sequentially too, to allow the story and characters to evolve in almost documentary fashion.  PrettyFamous | Graphiq Yet the greatest allure of this movie is the astounding, weaving, ever mobile cinematography of Arnold’s regular cameraman Robbie Ryan, easily a match for the dancing hand-held work of Emmanuel Lubezki for mystic Terrence Malick and showy Alejandro G Iñarritu. Ryan is right in the midst of these kids as they party and dance, and even more so in that crowded van with them all the time, not breaking the shot. It seems a real physical feat when, for many movies made in planes or trains (yes, that one), never mind vans, they have to be recreated as sets in enlarged form to make any sustained interior filming possible. No less remarkably, Ryan has found amazing depth and richness of colour and contrast in his journey across these states, from derelict shacks to palatial estates, oil fields to truck stops. It’s often beautiful just as photography, even if not taken any further as narrative. Arnold’s repeated insertion of images of natural life — insects, especially, birds, even a bear — are even more obviously derivative of Malick and seem intrusive. Star has a proclivity for releasing trapped insects: heavy-handed symbolism in an otherwise spontaneous-feeling film. Never mind. The film (in a tight 4:3 format) remains focused on Star, all the way on her journey. You’re on it with her, simple as that. Actually, there’s a point where she and Jake are having sex on the grass when you think they might ask the cameraman to give them some space.

She makes the film: she is not just remarkable-looking, she has her own way of making it seem that every moment she’s there, it’s her time, what happens matters. That’s a gift — and without her, American Honey would not be half the film it is. For otherwise it needs you as a viewer to be as captivated by Shia LaBeouf’s displays (smashing up the room when he thinks Star has been with someone else, showily motorbike riding, etc) as the heroine is herself. Not so easy. American Honey’s flaw is that it has no reason to begin where it begins or to end where it ends, if ever. It just goes on. And the meaning, the perspective on these kids, dancing on without consequences, as if youth itself were a guarantee? Perhaps it is just the director’s own party — so what’s to ask?

Deputy Sees Homeless Woman Walking Downtown Street in Her Bare Feet, Takes Her Shoe Shopping Inside Edition 14/10/2016 Deborah Hastings © Provided by CBS Interactive Inc. The woman, who was battling drug addiction, was trying to get her life back together. Tulsa County Sheriff’s Officer Brandon Hendrix doesn’t think he did anything extraordinary. “It’s just a pair of shoes,” he told InsideEdition.com Thursday. Not to thousands of people who have seen an online photo of him standing next to a barefoot homeless woman at a Walmart check-out line. Some 35,000 have viewed that image, making Hendrix a bit of a local hero in a town that could use some positive feelings directed at its law enforcement officers.   Hendrix, 43, had just left the department’s downtown headquarters when he saw a woman walking down a street in her bare feet. It was 87 degrees. The blacktop had to be blistering hot, he thought. “That looks pretty uncomfortable,” he remembers thinking. He followed her for a bit, then casually remarked on the absence of her shoes. The woman said she’d been in a fight with someone and lost her only pair. “Do you mind if I take you and buy you some new ones?” he asked her. He also called the station and asked for another officer to join him, “so she’d know I was on the up and up,” he said. She was skittish, but agreed to go. “I don’t think she really believed me until we got to Walmart,” he said. The woman volunteered a few details about her life. She’d become addicted to drugs and fallen on hard times. She had children somewhere. “She said she was trying to get her life back on track,” Hendrix said. He suggested that having shoes to walk that track sure couldn’t hurt. Inside the big box store, Hendrix told her to pick whatever she wanted. He and his fellow deputy hung back, he said, so people wouldn’t think she was their prisoner. Eventually she settled on a pair of canvas sneakers that were teal and gray – just like her dress, he said. He also got her some socks. “I wanted to take her to a nicer store, but wasn’t anything open,” Hendrix said, noting that it was early in the morning. He says he doesn’t remember how much the merchandise cost. “I don’t know,” he said. “I just paid with my credit card.” He drove her back downtown, but she wanted to be let out several blocks from where the homeless congregate. She didn’t want to be seen with law enforcement officers because she would be considered “a snitch,” she told him. That’s just fine, he said, and pulled over. Off she went with her new shoes on her feet. Hendrix says he doesn’t understand all the media attention his act of kindness has generated. One of the last big headlines to come from Tulsa law enforcement concerned the September fatal shooting of a motorist by Tulsa Police Officer Betty Shelby, who now faces manslaughter charges. Hendrix said he just tried to help someone who needed it. “I would hope that someone would do the same for someone in my family who needed something,” he said. “It’s not like it’s a big deal. It’s just a pair of shoes.” Go to MSN Home More in News Hunt for prisoners ‘at risk to public’ after they flee jail Mirror Second tremor hits NZ hours after deadly quake kills two Mirror NHS plans involving hospital closures 'kept secret from public' Press Association Theresa May sets out stall for UK's place in Trump’s world The Guardian Diabetic grandmother dies after Chinese 'slap treatment' The Telegraph London-bound flight forced to land after stork-hit Evening Standard Up Next May faces Cabinet pressure over Trump-Farage ties International Business Times More in News IVF mum marries donor after tracking him down and falling in love Mirror Tracking an elusive diary from Hitler's inner circle The New York Times £1bn Madonna becomes highest-grossing solo touring artist ever Evening Standard AdChoices AdChoices More from Inside Edition Mom Breastfeeds Hungry Daughter in Middle of Wedding Inside Edition Man Marries His Cell Phone in Vegas Inside Edition Single Mom Gives Lottery Winnings To Homeless Man Inside Edition Inside Edition View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sport Money Lifestyle Horoscopes Health & Fitness Food & Drink Cars Travel Dating © 2016 Microsoft Privacy & Cookies Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Anti-Spam Newsletter

Tags: heat exhaustion, Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital, Judge Jeffery O’Hara, Karol Anne Fitzgerald, Kent County District Court, toddler, Walmart, Ysquierdo   Karol Anne Fitzgerald A Stanton woman who left her sleeping two-year-old grandchild alone in the car while shopping at Walmart was found guilty Tuesday. Karol Anne Fitzgerald, 71, of Stanton, was found guilty and sentenced on Tuesday, October 11, by Kent County District Court Judge Jeffery O’Hara. She was sentenced to six months probation and ordered to take parenting classes. Police were called to the Walmart in Comstock Park on Saturday, May 21, at 6:18 p.m., on a report of a child left in a vehicle. Kent County Deputy Ysquierdo arrived on scene and found the 2-year-old girl in the back of a running car. He was unable to awaken her, and it appeared she had a red face and was sweaty. When he forced his way into the car, the child began to wake up. She was transferred to Helen DeVos Children’s Hospital with signs of heat exhaustion. She was later released to her mother with no injuries. The Deputy then found Fitzgerald, who had initially gone into the store for a prescription and left the car running with the air on and a window cracked. She had reportedly been in Walmart about 40 minutes. This post was written by: cspoststaff - who has written 11745 posts on Cedar Springs Post Newspaper.

However, all indications are that spending will stay strong in the months ahead. Nicholas Rossolillo (nrossolillo) Oct 13, 2016 at 3:23PM An Amazon delivery drone gets ready to take flight. Image source: Amazon. The all-important holiday shopping season is right around the corner. It has been a difficult year for traditional retailers like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT) as sales have hit a soft patch, but internet retailers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have enjoyed double-digit online sales growth once again this year. Though 2016 has been mixed thus far, chances are that retail sales will be strong headed into the winter months. Inflation is in hibernation Inflation, or the rising cost of goods and services, has overall been subdued in recent years. In 2015, the cost of living increases nearly hit a decade-long low of just 0.7%. The only time costs of living increased less was in 2008, when the rate hit 0.1%. While certain things like healthcare, rent, and college tuition have skyrocketed in recent years, other areas have decreased. For example, energy costs have been in decline since the summer of 2014, when oil peaked at about $110 barrel in the United States. Even with gains in recent weeks, oil here in the states is still sitting at less than half of its cost two years ago, at about $50 barrel. Why does this matter? While the monthly expenses picture might sound different depending on who you ask, on average, Americans are not seeing their basic costs of living increase. With the costs of putting food in the pantry and gas into the tank not budging much, or even falling for some, that means more money to spend on non-essentials, like this year's hottest toys, gadgets, and gizmos. Americans get a pay raise Even though the cost of living has taken a step back in recent years, so has the average American wage. Adjusted for inflation, the average U.S. household is still making less money than they were before the tech boom came undone in the late 1990s. However, that is starting to change. The U.S. Census Bureau reported last week that the average household got a pay raise of 5.2% in 2015. Wages are rising overall for the first time since 2007. While it's still shy of numbers reached in 1999, it is nonetheless still welcome news for many families. Paired with muted inflation last year, that pay increase amounts to more cash in pockets. This is backed up by recent reports showing that U.S. household disposable income -- money left over after the most basic of living expenses are paid for -- is still on the rise and hit a new record of over $1.4 trillion in August. With more cash in pockets, some of that money will inevitably get spent. Retailers are cutting each other's throats It's a race to the bottom in the world of retail. With the internet helping make pricing more transparent and empowering consumers to shop thrifty, prices of goods have been falling in recent years. This is evident in the last retail sales report, where general merchandiser's sales have fallen 0.1% this year, even while many are reporting growing foot traffic. This is obviously a great situation if you're a shopper, but why is this good if you're a seller of goods? While overall sales have been struggling, profit margins are on the rise since the cost to produce items has fallen, and online sales can help reduce more expensive overhead that comes with running a physical store. Low inflation helps families, but it also can benefit manufacturers. Part of the slowing inflation rate is coming from falling commodity prices, the base products used to make the stuff we all buy. Paired with selling costs falling -- in large part to store closures and a shift to the internet -- retailers don't necessarily need to sell as much as they did last year to maintain profitability. An example of this can be seen at Target. Though revenue has trailed off recently, profitability is still at an all-time high from cost-cutting and a lower costs of goods. The same is true for Amazon. The top line is growing, but bottom-line profit is growing faster. Data by YCharts. The final takeaway A lot of negativity has surrounded the retail industry this year, especially outside of online-only merchandisers, but all indications are that the holiday shopping season will be another strong one. Investors in the space should ignore the noise, but with the internet still heavily influencing sales to consumers, how your company is faring with its online efforts needs to be considered.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A      Newsmax Finance Insider Charles Sizemore told Newsmax TV that Amazon is about to "upend the grocery industry" as it plans to expand its grocery business with shops that let people quickly pick up milk, vegetables or other perishable foods. "Amazon is trying to get your grocery dollars for a very good reason,”  Sizemore told Newsmax Prime’s JD Hayworth. “Groceries, while they are a low-margin business, it's still something that every American pays for, usually on a weekly basis. If you're already buying your groceries at Amazon, you might also buy something that's higher margin,” he said. "Amazon's smart, they know what they're doing here," he explained. "I have a feeling they're about to really upend the grocery industry. It's about to get really interesting. It's just not quite what everyone's expecting."   See JD Hayworth on Newsmax TV: Tune in beginning at 1 PM EDT to see "America Talks Live" – on FiOS 115, YouTube Livestream, Newsmax TV App from any smartphone, NewsmaxTV.com, Roku, Amazon Fire – More Systems Here   The Wall Street Journal cited unnamed sources as saying Amazon will open real world shops to augment its Fresh subscription service that lets members order groceries for delivery. Seattle-based Amazon intends to open small stores stocked with perishable items, and where shoppers can use smartphones or perhaps touchscreen stations to order longer lasting items such as canned goods for same-day delivery, according to the Journal. Amazon will add drive-up locations where grocery orders will be brought to cars, and is working on technology to automatically read license plates to speed the process, the Journal reported. Sizemore said such a strategy is pure genius. “I don't really want raw chicken sitting on my front porch waiting for me to come home in the evening. It makes a lot more sense if you have something like a physical location where I could order it online, I could pick it up on my way home,” said Sizemore, chief investment officer of the investment firm Sizemore Capital Management and the author of the Sizemore Insights blog. Highlighting a wide-ranging interview, Sizemore touched on many hot business topics of the day: Wal-Mart Raises Entry-level Manager Salaries Ahead of Overtime Rule. “By raising those salaries, they're avoiding the potential overtime pay rules that are going into effect,” Sizemore said. “So the way it is now with the overtime rules that go into effect, a lot of those Wal-Mart managers would be eligible for overtime. By just raising their salaries, Wal-Mart's better able to budget it. They know ahead of time roughly what their expenses are going to be.” Samsung Kills Galaxy Note 7 After Global Recall, New Fires. “You know it's bad when they're actual making fireproof boxes to send the phone back. Samsung's having to go to that level actually making a fireproof box in order to return the item. It's bad, it's a bad headline, and it's definitely going to affect their profitability for the next quarter or two. That's inescapable,” he said. “I don't know that it's going to have this long-term impact. I think it'll be a really rough quarter or two, they'll definitely take a bath on their earnings.” Apple Stock Hits Highest Since December on Samsung Note 7 Fire Crisis. Sizemore said Apple just might see a boost from the Samsung fiasco. “You might see a small jump in the iPhone 7 Plus, the larger iPhone. There may be a slight bump there but I don't know that it's going to be something that would translate to multi-year success. I'm long Apple, I actually like the company a lot, I think it's very reasonably priced. That said, I don't know that this particular incident with Samsung is going to be a windfall.”   (Newsmax wire service AFP contributed to this report).   Charles Lewis Sizemore, CFA, is chief investment officer of the investment firm Sizemore Capital Management and the author of the Sizemore Insights blog.

Photos Hot Bodies Candid Red Carpet Sightings Most Important People Crap We Missed Bikinis Store Share < br />this article: Miley Cyrus Sleeps With A Picture Of Woody Allen Now Photo Boy @photochrist | October 13, 2016 - 12:00 pm Share < br />this article: Miley Cyrus stars in Woody Allen’s new Amazon series, Crisis In Six Scenes, so that means during press Miley Cyrus is going to gush about what a great guy Woody Allen is again, because we live in an amazing time where a pansexual nipple fairy who used to work for Disney and once made diaper porn is the voice of a generation. On top of fawning all over Woody, she’s also totally over it when it comes to Hollywood, while of course still living in, and working in Hollywood. Welcome to your morning rage. On where all of this horseshit comes from, so remember that up front: “I had a clothing line at Walmart and got kicked out, because they said you had to choose weed or Walmart,” Cyrus says. “And you see what I did — I chose weed.” On how boring it was making all those millions that now allow her to mouth shart dumb every time she’s interviewed: “I know that acting is boring,” she says. “People get paid way too much for what they are doing.” On how being from a Southern religious family prepared her for being pansexual, because that makes perfect sense: My whole life, I didn’t understand my own gender and my own sexuality. I always hated the word “bisexual,” because that’s even putting me in a box. I don’t ever think about someone being a boy or someone being a girl. Also, my nipple pasties and shit never felt sexualized to me. My eyes started opening in the fifth or sixth grade. My first relationship in my life was with a chick. I grew up in a very religious Southern family. The universe has always given me the power to know I’ll be OK. Even at that time, when my parents didn’t understand, I just felt that one day they are going to understand. On the categorically fake anecdote meant to soften the blow for when she says what “a really great dad” he is in a minute: I am. I had moved, and the only thing that I brought into my new house was a picture of Woody Allen. My first night I slept in my new house, [my manager] called and said, “Woody wants you to fly to New York.” I loved working with Woody. You do like two takes. He just wants to go home and have dinner with his wife. One night it was 5:30, and the camera operator wanted to do another take. He goes, “I can’t dedicate my entire life to making movies.” The “really great dad” part: I live a similar life to Woody — I live a public life. Until I know someone and I know their story, I never really judge anyone. That’s kind of how I went into it. From the way I saw him with his family, I never saw him be anything but an incredible person and a really great dad. People might slam me for saying that. I’m sure it was a hard time for that family. My family has been through hard things, and I think everyone’s suffering is different. And hey, maybe Woody Allen is a great dad to the kids who haven’t accused him of molestation, or the other kid who keeps trashing him in the press for being a molester. Who’s to say? Oh, that’s right, Billy Ray Cyrus’ gender fluid offspring who’s constantly high and loves that Allen seems to be as lazy as she is. We should probably listen to her sage advice, in fact, why not let her judge his molestation case that never got close to a trial, because of high-powered lawyers, and an intense smear campaign in the media? “All rise. The honorable judge Miley Cyrus presiding. Your honor, today’s case i— goddamnit, you rolled joints with the pages of the docket again, didn’t you?” THE SUPERFICIAL | About • Facebook • Twitter Photo: Getty Tags: Miley Cyrus, Woody Allen 15 Recommended for you Miley Cyrus Is Still A Thing That Exists Susan Sarandon On Woody Allen: ‘I Think He Sexually Assaulted A Child’ Woody Allen Jokes Hurt Blake Lively’s Feelings, You Guys Ronan Farrow Punches Hollywood In The Dick Over Woody Allen I Think Miley Cyrus Is Engaged Again, Call It A Hunch Miley Cyrus & Liam Hemsworth Are Probably Back Together Comments Comments Show the rest of the comments Around the Web So Freaking Hot The Crap We Missed - Thursday 11.10.16 The Crap We Missed - Wednesday 11.9.16 Good Morning, Daisy Lea Topless, And Other News We Now Return To A Naked Kardashian Already In Progress Chrissy Teigen's Boobs Aren't Donald Trump Butt Fucking America Lindsay Lohan Is Trying To Pull A Charity Scam With Her Accent Now Good Morning, Chantelle Connelly Bikini Photos, And Other News Anna Katharina Welcomes You To Our Future Hellscape And Other News Favorites BEST OF 2015: Hilary Duff In A Bikini BEST OF 2015: Chrissy Teigen Topless BEST OF 2015: Jessica Simpson's Nipples BEST OF 2015: Miley Cyrus' Rubber Vagina That Isn't Even Real, C'mon!

Of those cities, 12 are located in the United States and eight in China. One-third of the top cities are national political capitals as well as economic powerhouses, and more than half the 42 cities are located along or in close proximity to a seacoast. The data were included in a new report from the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and is based on gross domestic product (GDP) or revenue data for 2014. The report includes the top country economies ranked by GDP and the top companies ranked by 2014 revenues. Of the 50 largest economies, only one is a company — Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) — while 13 are cities and 37 are countries. National economies grab the top 13 positions in the rankings before the top city, Tokyo, sneaks in at number 14. Only seven companies made the list of the top 100 economies, and five of those were oil companies, including two state-controlled Chinese companies: Sinopec, or officially China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (NYSE: SNP), and PetroChina Co. Ltd. (NYSE: PTR). The four largest country economies and their 2014 GDP totals are: China: $17.19 trillion United States: $16.49 trillion India: $6.98 trillion Japan: $4.52 trillion The four largest cities and their GDP totals are: Tokyo: $1.54 trillion New York City: $1.33 trillion Los Angeles: $818 billion Seoul-Incheon: $804 billion The four largest companies ranked by 2014 revenues are: Wal-Mart: $453 billion Royal Dutch Shell PLC (NYSE: RDS-A): $429 billion Sinopec: $423 billion Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM): $375 billion Excepting Wal-Mart, the only non-oil company to make the list was Germany’s embattled Volkswagen Group ($249 billion) at number 100. Other U.S. cities on the list: Chicago ($535 billion); Houston ($459 billion); Washington, D.C., ($420 billion); Dallas ($392 billion); Boston ($342 million); Philadelphia ($329 billion); San Francisco ($315 billion); Atlanta ($280 billion); Seattle ($254 billion); and Miami ($250 billion).

A woman shopping Sunday morning at a Walmart in Payson, Utah, surprised workers and customers when she approached Register 11, dropped to her knees, clutched her stomach, and … pulled out her wallet. She was in labor, ABC News reports, but she insisted on paying for her items first before she took care of her next transaction: having the baby right there in the store. "We weren't really interested in taking her money at [that] point, but she insisted," says Walmart manager Dustin Haight, who KSTU notes called 911 and implored her not to worry about the tab. "It wasn't like she was like, 'OK, let's get this baby out and [then] I'll pay.' She paid and then had the baby." As soon as the woman, identified as Cecelia Rivas by the Daily Herald, had paid up, employees and customers sprang into action, with some hunting down towels and blankets while others held sheets up to give her privacy. "By the time the EMTs got here, she had … a baby [boy]," Haight tells KSTU. "She was very calm," an assistant chief from the local fire department adds. "It was her third child … so I don't think she was as nervous about it other than it was at Walmart." Rivas admits she actually was "really scared," though she tells the Herald as soon as she saw her new son, "I was so happy." A spokesman for the hospital where Rivas and baby Matias were taken says they're both "doing well," per ABC. And Haight is counting on a new repeat customer. "Hopefully we'll be part of his life forever," he tells ABC. (A text-messaging conversation about this Walmart shopping trip went viral.)

SavingsAngel also provides hundreds of 50 percent off or better deals each week to members by matching local grocery and drug store sales with its free database of over 5,000 accessible coupons. Every year, the sugar overload from Halloween trick-or-treating and harvest parties can do damage for several days (if the candy even lasts that long). Kids experience the highs - and crashes - of consuming too many sweets, too close together. In fact, the Pacific Science Center states that the average trick or treat bag contains 4,800 calories, three cups of sugar, and 1.5 cups of fat. 1). Homemade crayons: Use up old crayons - or buy a few cheap packages (you can get a box of 48 for only one dollar at Dollar Tree) - and make homemade, Halloween-shaped crayons. Pick up a themed candy mold from a candy supply shop or a store like Party City for a couple of dollars. Remove the paper wrappings from each crayon, and break (or chop with a sharp knife), into small pieces. Place pieces into the mold, and melt the crayons at 200 degrees. Once melted, remove from the oven and fully cool. Pop them out of the mold. Estimated price for 100 small crayons, five dollars. 2). Stampers: Get 50 assorted stampers from OrientalTrading.com for less than $10 right now. 3.) Assorted small toys: Get 100 for less than $20 right now on Oriental Trading or by hitting the dollar store and combing the abundant options. Bonus: Want to save even more on OrientalTrading.com? Shop their clearance and "less than perfect" sections. 4.) Pretzels in individual bags: A trick-or-treat hit, you can get a 40-count Utz brand package for under $5 at Walmart. 5.) Goldfish crackers in individual bags: Loved by kids and adults alike, get a 25-count bag for around $5 at Walmart. 6.) Mini bubbles: They don't have to be Halloween themed to be fun. Get them by the box online or at the dollar store. Also check Michael's or JoAnn Fabrics for clearance offers. About five dollars for 40 bottles. 7.) Temporary tattoos: Get approximately 24 for two dollars at Walmart, or check the dollar store and online. 8.). Mini erasers: Get a huge assortment online from Oriental Trading (currently they have a 720-count package for less than $15), or shop the dollar store for themed erasers or pencil toppers. 9.) Sticker sheets: You can get a book of 50 sheets for only $1 at Dollar Tree. 10.) Glow in the dark sticks, necklaces or bracelets: Dollar Tree has 20-count glow bracelet packs for just one dollar. 11.) Bead necklaces: Order online or get eight-count packs from Dollar Tree for one dollar each. 12.) Themed pencils: Get 12-count packs from the dollar store, or order in bulk online. 13.) Treat coupons: Get packs of treat coupons, for local restaurants. These coupons aren't necessarily all sugar-free, but they are a nice item to give out, and different than straight candy. Booklets of multiple coupons sell for around one dollar at restaurants like McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's. Some other businesses offer these booklets as well, such as 7-11's 20 small Slurpees books for five dollars. These books go fast, and not all locations participate in the promotion, so I recommend looking for these early in the month. If you choose to go with something like small toys, rings, mini erasers or anything else small: Be sure to hand it to the parent or another adult with any child that looks to be three or under. This is a safety precaution since you never know if they may stick it in their mouth.

Brookhaven police officer Carlos Nino says Kamonie Love Whitehead died around 10:30 p.m. Saturday at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta Egleston. Police are waiting on the autopsy results next week before deciding to upgrade the charges against the girl’s mother Shavone Whitehead and her boyfriend Edward F. Wilson. Both are charged with cruelty to children and aggravated battery. Court records show the girl had injuries to her legs, buttocks, chin and arms along with multiple fractures and a possible skull fracture. WSB-TV reports a legal document shows the mother admitting to using a belt on occasion to punish the child. Groups plans memorial to lynching victims in Alabama Groups plans memorial to lynching victims in Alabama MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) - A private group says it plans to open a national memorial to lynching victims next year in Alabama. The Montgomery-based Equal Justice Initiative says it has identified more than 4,000 lynchings of blacks in the United States from 1877 until 1950. The memorial announced Tuesday will include a museum exploring the history of race in the United States, from slavery through the mass incarceration of the modern era. It will be built in Montgomery, near what was once one of the largest slave auction sites in the South. The sponsoring group, Equal Justice Initiative, is headed by attorney Bryan Stevenson, who’s best known for representing death row inmates and juvenile defendants in Alabama and other states. Greensboro council to discuss sit-in museum debt again Greensboro council to discuss sit-in museum debt again GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) - The Greensboro City Council will discuss again whether it should write off the nearly $800,000 that the city says a museum owes from a “forgivable loan.’’ The News & Record of Greensboro reports (http://bit.ly/2b2KFd9) the council is scheduled to discuss the loan to the International Civil Rights Center & Museum at its meeting Tuesday. At a meeting earlier this month, council members refused to write off the loan. The debt stems from a $1.5 million loan in which the city forgives a dollar for every dollar the museum raised from September 2013 to July 2015. Museum officials say the debt is about $280,000. The museum honors the sit-in movement that began in 1960 when four black college freshmen refused to leave the whites-only lunch counter at the Woolworth store. Oklahoma man jailed in killing accused of anti-Muslim rants Oklahoma man jailed in killing accused of anti-Muslim rants TULSA, Okla. (AP) - An Oklahoma man suspected of fatally shooting a male neighbor was accused of harassing and shouting anti-Muslim slurs at the man’s family, who are actually Christians from Lebanon, and of trying to run over the man’s mother with his vehicle. Police say Khalid Jabara was killed at his Tulsa home last Friday and 61-year-old Stanley Majors is being held without bail on a first-degree murder complaint and possession of a firearm after a felony conviction, but online court records do not show that he has been formally charged. It was not clear if Majors has an attorney to speak on his behalf. Jabara’s family issued a statement saying Majors had called the family “dirty Arabs,’’ “filthy Lebanese,’’ “Aye-rabs,’’ and “Mooslems.’’ Prosecutors had charged Majors with injuring Jabara’s mother, Haifa, in September by driving his vehicle into her. According to court records, Majors was charged with assault and battery with a deadly weapon, leaving the scene of a collision involving injury, violating a protective order and public intoxication. Prosecutors tried to keep Majors in jail on the assault charge, but he was released after posting bond on May 25. Majors’ attorney in that case did not immediately return a phone call for comment after business hours on Tuesday. Majors was charged with violating the protective order in March 2014 after Haifa Jabra told police he had yelled racial slurs at her while she was in her driveway and threatened to kill her. The Tulsa World reports (http://bit.ly/2byi02N ) that Tulsa police Sgt. Dave Walker and Assistant District Attorney John David Luton said Monday that it’s too early in the investigation to say if Majors will be charged with a hate crime. × Post a comment Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.

Police say the man conducted the scheme both on Sept. 28 and earlier in May, spokesman Lt. Stephen Cronin said on Wednesday. In September, the man approached a cashier to buy two iPads valued at $1,500. “He was conducting a grifting scheme,” Cronin said. After the cashier counted the money, the man asked for the money back to count it himself. He repeated the act repeatedly, leaving with the two iPads. It was only discovered later, when totaling up the cash in the register, that he also took back $700 of the $1,500 he originally handed the clerk. Cronin said the man pulled off a similar scheme in May. The man is described as being a dark-skinned, about 6 feet tall. He was wearing “high end clothes,” and spoke with a Middle Eastern accent. He was seen driving away in a silver Mercedes. Anyone with information about the theft is asked to call Detective Val Krishtal at 508-532-5923.

The Estuary applied for a grant through the Walmart Foundation State Giving Program and was awarded the money to cover purchase of the new machine and its installation, including the necessary updates to plumbing and electrical, and reworking the stainless table surround to accommodate the new machine.  (See photo at left.) The new machine is a much higher efficiency model and uses about one third of the water compared to the old machine and is Energy Star-rated for increased utility efficiency.  It also has a higher per load speed and capacity so more dishes can be done in less time.  In addition, it is a high temperature sanitizing machine, which eliminates the need for costly chemicals also. The Estuary is the regional senior center serving the towns of Clinton, Chester, Deep River, Essex, Killingworth, Lyme, Old Lyme, Old Saybrook, and Westbrook.  The Estuary served over 55,000 meals in its Meals on Wheels Program last year and served over an additional 20,000 meals at its three congregate meal sites in the nine-town region.  The center also hosts a full range of services, instructional classes, exercise and fitness programs, and opportunities for socialization to local seniors. The Estuary Council of Seniors extend special thanks to the Walmart Foundation for making possible the purchase and installation of this new piece of equipment — and all the resultant clean dishes for years to come!  The Estuary believes that Walmart is a great community partner in the mission to help those locally in need.  To find out more about the Estuary Council of Seniors, visit the center at 220 Main Street, Old Saybrook, or www.ecsenior.org or call (860) 388-1611.

City council OKs downtown parking changes Nathaniel Shuda , USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin 9:42 a.m. CDT October 15, 2016 Buy Photo The Oshkosh Common Council discusses the issue of paid on-street parking downtown during its Oct. 11, 2016, meeting. (Photo: Nathaniel Shuda/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)Buy Photo OSHKOSH - Visitors to downtown Oshkosh could soon see changes city officials hope will make parking easier and less of a hassle. But paid parking isn't one of them — at least not yet, anyway. The Oshkosh Common Council adopted a series of recommendations Tuesday from Walker Parking Consultants that include spending $10,000 for about 30 signs that more clearly identify public parking areas. It also will revamp its "minimalist" parking website to include easy-to-access information about parking rules, permits, on-street parking and citations, as well as searchable GIS and interactive maps. RELATED: City to mull downtown parking options RELATED: Oshkosh gets input on central city strategy However, councilors held off on deciding whether to bring back paid on-street parking downtown and install pay stations on every block, citing concerns about the $400,000 price tag, potential negative feedback from the public and that opinions about paid parking ebb and flow too often. "I support 90 percent of the plan, but I don’t believe our citizens are going to be happy about going downtown and having to pay to park when they can go to Target and Walmart, all the other stores and pay nothing," Councilor Steve Herman said. "I know the BID supports it, but they're also the ones that wanted (paid) parking removed 10 years ago or 15 years ago," Herman said. "Are we going to spend all this money (to) put the pay stations in and all that and 10 years later, another council's going to say 'nuh uh'?" The Downtown Oshkosh Business Improvement District, which was created in 1987 in an effort to keep parking downtown, supports the plan and says it will contribute to the cost of the pay station program — about half the $400,000 or $20,000 a year for 10 years, City Manager Mark Rohloff said. "When we met with them, we told them ... they needed to make a good-faith effort for this to happen," Rohloff said. "As we explained it to the BID, there had to be something that the BID was going to continue to do to support parking." RELATED: Oshkosh council OKs grant for strategy study Downtown BID board members unanimously endorsed the recommendations, in the hopes that the plan would create a new source of revenue for parking improvements, said Jim Collins, the city's transportation director. "I'm struggling with spending almost half a million dollars (for parking stations), knowing potentially we're still going to be under water," Deputy Mayor Deb Allison-Aasby said. "When it comes to the expenditure of that, I'm going to struggle with that until somebody can provide some information that would sway me in that." Councilors directed Rohloff and city staff to reach out to the BID and to the city's parking utility and report back.

At about 7:30 a.m. Thursday, Pappe crashed into several parked cars in the parking lot of the Grants Pass Walmart store while driving a silver Chevrolet Suburban SUV, according to OSP, which is handling the shooting investigation. Pappe then drove in the wrong lane down Redwood Highway until he crashed into a guardrail near F Street. Pappe refused to leave his vehicle when ordered by Grants Pass police, and he could be seen holding a large knife, police said. After police attempted to negotiate with Pappe for about 20 minutes, Pappe allegedly exited the truck and headed toward officers while carrying the knife. Police said they fired a Taser and bean-bag rounds at Pappe, but the man continued to advance. Police fired multiple gunshots at Pappe, then called medics who were already staged nearby. Pappe was pronounced dead at the scene. No officers were injured during the incident, and the names of the officers involved are being withheld pending investigation, said OSP Sgt. Kyle Hove. A medical examiner and forensics investigators will determine the number of shots fired and by whom, Hove said. The report will be submitted to the Josephine County District Attorney's Office. "We look at every aspect of it," Hove said. Court records show Pappe in 2015 rammed his vehicle into the back of his foreclosed Gold Hill home because he was upset squatters were living in it. Police said he poured gasoline in the residence after threatening to burn the house down. He pleaded no contest to a felony charge of second-degree arson in the case. — Reach reporter Nick Morgan at 541-776-4471 or nmorgan@mailtribune.com.

(WPRI) — A popular type of protein bars are being recalled because they could be contaminated with a dangerous bacterium. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Nutrisystem bars were sold in several states, including Rhode Island and Massachusetts, as well as online on sites such as Amazon.com and Walmart.com. The chocolate chip cookie dough in the Nutricrush bars may be contaminated with listeria, which can cause serious, even fatal infections. The recalled products have an “enjoy by” date of Aug. 22, 2017 and a lot code of NF082216A.

Prosecutors say on the night of Oct. 5, 95-year-old Thomas Harty was beaten and stabbed to death, and 77-year-old Joanna Fisher was beaten, nearly suffocated and survived a knife wound to the throat. Fisher remains in the hospital. According to Northwestern District Attorney David Sullivan, Fisher told investigators that she and her husband were watching television when a pair of suspects invaded their home, launched a savage attack and fled with credit cards, cash and the couple's 2003 Toyota station wagon. Joshua Hart, 23, and Brittany Smith, 27, both of Athol, were arraigned Friday in Orange District Court, where they pleaded not guilty to murder, attempted murder and a host of other charges. The pair were arrested Oct. 7 after fleeing to Virginia. Sullivan, Assistant District Attorney Jeremy Bucci and Orange Police Chief Craig Lundgren spoke to reporters after the arraignment and revealed details of the attack. According to a statement of alleged facts released by Sullivan's office: • The home invasion lasted for approximately two hours. Hart immediately attacked Harty and stabbed him with a knife. Smith struck and pushed Fisher from her wheelchair to the floor. Smith stabbed Fisher and cut her throat. The two unsuccessfully tried to suffocate Fisher. They ransacked the home in search of money, took credit cards, a cellphone and cash, and fled the scene in the older couple's station wagon. • Harty died after suffering stab wounds and being suffocated with a pillow. • Fisher crawled in an effort to call for help. She learned that the suspects had disabled the phone and stolen Harty's cellphone. She took refuge within her home until health care workers made a scheduled visit around 9 a.m. on Oct. 6. The workers summoned help and Fisher was transported to the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester. • Fisher described to police a white male, 5-foot-8 or 5-foot-9, with facial hair, and a female who was slender with dark hair and dark eyes. • Within hours of the home invasion, a purchase was attempted at a Walmart in the Worcester area using a credit card stolen from Harty. A transaction for the same merchandise was then made using a debit card stolen from Fisher. • Video surveillance at Walmart showed a vehicle matching the description of the Toyota, and a man and woman matching the description of the suspects. Investigators recognized the pair as Hart and Smith.   • On Friday night, Oct. 7, Massachusetts State Police attached to the Northwestern district attorney's office obtained arrest warrants for larceny of a motor vehicle and receiving stolen property, and activated them in a national warrant database. • On Saturday morning, Oct. 8, members of the Rockridge County Sheriff's Department in Virginia arrested Hart and Smith without incident in a U-Haul parked in a Walmart parking lot. • Hart admitted to Rockridge officials and Massachusetts State Police that he had murdered Harty and had tried to help Smith kill Fisher. Smith admitted that she and Hart had worked together and armed themselves with a knife prior to coming to the residence. • Hart told investigators they looked at homes in the area for an older car to avoid tracking technology, and a target that would have money to help them escape. • Hart told investigators he and Smith looked in the window and saw Harty. They tried to enter through a window and failed. Both told investigators they entered the garage, found keys to the car and entered the home through a door in the garage. • Their stated motive was to avoid going to jail on a previous charge (Hart) and to avoid drug treatment (Smith) and to leave the area and start a new life. Hart and Smith are charged with murder, attempted murder, home invasion, armed robbery, conspiracy and larceny over $250. In separate dockets, they are charged with larceny of a motor vehicle and receiving stolen property. Conviction on the murder charge carries a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole. The two are held without bail pending a court date in December.  MASSLIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA MassLive News on Facebook MassLive News on Twitter MassLive Instagram Breaking News newsletter When the big stories break, we'll send you an alert.

Wellness Day: Free Check-Ups, Flu Shots Oct. 15 Nearly 300,000 people were screened last year Oct 14, 2016, 4:30 pm EST  |  By Karl Utermohlen, InvestorPlace Writer     Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Wellness Day is right around the corner, offering a number of free health check-ups for those who arrive early. Source: ©iStock.com/Niloo138 4,600 of the company’s locations around the country will take part in Walmart Wellness Day, which is on Saturday, October 15. The event takes place from noon to 4 p.m. You will have access to free blood glucose and blood pressure tests, vision screenings, product samples and information on health care insurance. You don’t have to make an appointment, but make sure you show up on time. Walmart is also offering flu shots at over 10,000 pharmacies. Some are calling it the largest screening event in the nation as the retailer screened 280,000 patients in 2015. Additionally, Walmart managed to give out 52,000 flu shots and check the blood pressure of 7,000 people. One of these had such high blood pressure that he had to be rushed to the emergency room of a local hospital immediately. Another 3,000 customers were implored to see a professional in their area to check their blood glucose levels as they were simply not up to par. “We’re committed and uniquely positioned to provide accessible and affordable healthcare that helps busy families live better,” said George Riedl, senior vice president and president of health and wellness for Walmart U.S., in a statement. Walmart recently announced that it was giving entry-level managers a pay raise of more than $1,000, as well as paying overtime to those who make less than $23,660. WMT shares surged 0.5% Friday.

Chase Bryan Little, 31, and Colton Tye Leblanc, 24, were charged with felony assault with hate-crime enhancements in the attack on Maan Singh Khalsa. A man previously identified as a suspect, Dustin Albarado of Louisiana, was cleared of criminal liability, said Simon O’Connell, Contra Costa County deputy district attorney “The savage cutting of Mr. Khalsa’s unshorn hair, a sacred article of his faith, constitutes a hate crime under the law,” O’Connell said in a statement.

The men were in the East Bay for contract assignments at the Chevron refinery in Richmond. Little is from Beaumont, Texas, while Lablanc is from Winnie, Texas. The confrontation unfolded the night of Sept. 25 as Khalsa, 41, was leaving a Richmond Walmart and stopped at a red light at the intersection of Blume and Hilltop drives. A white, four-door truck with five men inside pulled up next to Khalsa, and a man in the back seat threw a half-empty beer can at him, Khalsa told police. Khalsa told officers he said, “You forgot something,” as he got out of his car and threw the can back at the truck. The men in the truck started screaming and cursing at him, and as soon as Khalsa left the intersection, driving east on Hilltop Drive, the truck followed him, officials said. At an intersection before the Interstate 80 overpass, the truck again pulled up to Khalsa, who sensed something wasn’t right and called 911. Before police could arrive, according prosecutors, two men in the back seat got out of the truck and began punching Khalsa in the face through his open window while yelling profanities at him and knocking off his turban — an important part of Sikhism that’s made some of its wearers targets of violent anti-Muslim bias by people confusing the two religions. After they were done beating him, one of the men yelled, “cut his f— hair off,” Khalsa told police. Little used a knife to cut Khalsa’s hair and stab Khalsa in the hand as he tried to protect himself, officials said.

Eventually, after making a number of quick turns, Khalsa was able to get away as he began blacking out from the pummeling. “No community should be attacked because of their faith, ethnicity, gender or sexuality,” said Harsimran Kaur, legal director of the Sikh Coalition, which had pressed for the hate crime charges. Little is out on bail, and a bench warrant will be issued for Leblanc, O’Connell said. Jenna Lyons and Kimberly Veklerov are San Francisco Chronicle staff writers.

 A new way to search for data is helping NASA's biggest brains save millions and get to space faster Matt Weinberger Oct. 14, 2016, 5:16 PM 3,466 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Orion crew capsule. NASA NASA is using a database technology popularized by Facebook to save millions just by making sure its engineers don't repeat the mistakes of the past. The same technology is directly applicable to industry, real-time analytics, the Internet of Things, and large-scale retail, too. Not too long ago, an engineer on the Orion spacecraft had a major problem, David Meza, Chief Knowledge Architect at NASA's Johnson Space Center, recently explained to Business Insider. Orion's uprighting system, which flips the returning capsule right-side-up after it splashes down in the ocean, wasn't working correctly. In tests and simulations, the capsule stayed on its side, even after hitting the water. Not great, considering it's supposed to be carrying four astronauts. Luckily, NASA maintains the so-called "Lessons Learned" system, where the agency's engineers take the lessons they've learned and contribute them to a central database. Lessons Learned spans a half-century of collective NASA engineering knowledge, all the way back to the legendary Apollo moon missions — which is good, because Apollo used a similar uprighting system to Orion. There was every possibility that somewhere in Lessons Learned was the key to fixing Orion. But that massive database is no good if you can't find anything. NASA's original web search for Lessons Learned couldn't turn anything up; even NASA's History Office only turned up 3 relevant files in eight days of looking. The Orion team even visited retired Apollo astronauts at home to see if maybe they had anything useful in their attics. NASA Chief Knowledge Architect David Meza Screenshot/YouTube That's where Meza and his team came in. Meza had been experimenting with a new, smarter, data-driven approach to sifting the Lessons Learned database. Within three hours, Meza's better Lessons Learned had come up with 30 relevant documents. One the first 10 documents had cure for what ailed Orion. The mission was back on track. Meza says the engineer approached him afterwards: Without that information, NASA would have had to spend 2 years and millions of dollars building a second Orion uprighting system just to test, delaying its 2023 launch further.  Graph search Meza cites the Orion case as a big reason why his team has embraced a newer kind of database, growing in popularity among developers, called a "graph database," a term first popularized by Neo Technology. Neo makes the Neo4j software, used by customers including Marriott, Monsanto, Walmart, and Meza's team at NASA.  Facebook borrowed the term for its famed "social graph," which it introduced in 2007. In fact, Facebook is a great example of a graph database: Everything is defined by relationships.  Mark Zuckerberg explains the Facebook social graph. Justin Sullivan/Getty Your profile is instantly and invisibly linked to everybody who likes the same bands, foods, places you've been, songs you've listened to on Spotify, and so on. So when you search Facebook for "Friends who like Nickelback," it's basically drawing a line between your friends and people who like the band. It seems simple. But with more traditional "relational databases," which are more like giant spreadsheets, it would be impossible at Facebook's scale, or at least "really, really, really slow," says Neo4j CEO Emil Eifrem. Imagine an Excel workbook with multiple tabs, one listing all your friends, one for everybody on Facebook who likes Nickelback, and so on. Then, imagine having to compare the two databases to find a match. Then, imagine doing that for every single one of the people who visit Facebook every day. Not easy, cheap, or fast. Down to earth At NASA, Meza's team combined a Neo4j graph database with the combined know-how of a data science specialist and a web developer to come up with a better, smarter way to search the Lessons Learned database. Before, Lessons Learned required you to punch in a keyword, like "valve contamination," which would produce a bunch of links to documents in a spreadsheet. But there was no way to search within those documents: You'd have to download the files as they came up, one by one, and hope it was in there. By putting Lessons Learned into a graph database, combined with some magic with statistics, it became a lot simpler to link together the millions of articles in the database in a way that's just a little bit more like Wikipedia — automatically and intelligently grouping together articles based on their content and the words used therein.  A simple example of a graph database. It's all about the relationships.Neo4j It means that the NASA Lessons Learned database can make more natural connections between topics. "Valve maintenance" might lead to "water corrosion" might lead to "fire hazards," based on cross-indexed words in the article. It means engineers can spend less time guessing the magic words to make their answer appear and get back to work on Orion.  Intriguingly, the International Consortium of Independent Journalists used Neo4j to similar ends, putting the Panama Papers leak into a graph so hundreds of reporters from around the world could sort the data and come up with blistering reveals on the effects of offshoring capital on the global economy.  World domination Graph databases are broadly applicable past Meza's brand of knowledge management, as well. It turns out that graph databases are fabulous at pattern detection: Going back to the Facebook example, it's pretty simple for it to guess that you might know somebody if 90% of your friends know them, too. Similarly, if half of your friends like Taco Bell on Facebook, it's not that hard to extrapolate that you might, as well.   That's why Amazon built its own graph database system, called Dynamo, early on in its development to power its famed recommendation engine. If a book has lots of attributes in common (author, subject matter, publisher) with something a customer bought, Dynamo can go through that graph and guess that you might like it.  Neo Technology CEO Emil Eifrem Neo4j "The graph can be people connected to other people, or it can be other things," explains Eifrem. In a business context, graph databases are fabulous for fraud detection, for the same reasons. Instead of looking for characteristics of a person or product, you're looking for characteristics of a credit card transaction. All the transactions made to or from, say, specific accounts are all connected to each other. So if one is fraudulent, all the connections probably are, too.  Graph databases are a newer way of looking at data — not just the data, but how each point relates to each other. NASA is using it to move faster; Amazon and Walmart are using it for commerce. Either way, Facebook might be the most visible graph out there, but it's not the only one.

Here are three trends to watch when the company reports third-quarter earnings. Jordan Wathen (TMFValueMagnet) Oct 14, 2016 at 4:35PM Image source: Getty Images. Some people say a lot. Some say very little. Companies can exhibit similar tendencies. Main Street Capital (NYSE:MAIN) doesn't file all that frequently with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and its press releases can be few and far between, so keeping up with the company between quarterly reports can be harder than keeping up with some of its peers. Sept. 30 has come and gone, and with the books closed on the company's third quarter, I thought it to be a good time to review events in the third quarter and the first nine months of the year. A winner in every quarter Main Street Capital is a business development company (BDC), which is a special type of financial company that makes money by lending to and investing in small businesses in the United States. Most investments come in the form of debt, while a smaller portion takes the form of equity. The debt investments provide routine interest income, where equity offers upside (or downside) in the form of capital gains or losses. Main Street Capital has sold a company at a significant realized gain in each of the first three quarters of 2016. Calendar Quarter Company Realized Gain 1Q 2016 Southern RV $14.4 million 2Q 2016 Samba Safety $28.4 million 3Q 2016 Travis Acquisition $17.9 million Total   $60.7 million Data source: Company investor relations and SEC filings. The most recent exit of Travis Acquisition was detailed in an Oct. 6 press release, though the acquirer noted in its own press release that the transaction closed on Sept. 30, the last day of Main Street Capital's third quarter. It is great to see a BDC sell portfolio companies at a gain, especially when the sales price is in excess of its most recent valuations. In an ideal world, all BDCs would generate gains on their equity investments in excess of their losses, and, most importantly, turn those gains into cash by selling their stakes to someone else. Of course, BDCs control when they realize gains, and they also control when they realize losses.  What about the losers? Winners are frequently balanced with losers, and all BDCs will have losers. The only way to bat 1.000 is to buy risk-free U.S. Treasuries and hold them to maturity. The most difficult question to answer for any BDC is just how much of its capital losers will consume over the long haul. For Main Street, there are some losers to worry about, namely the companies in its portfolio that are most exposed to energy prices. After all, its realized gains in 2016 have come from companies outside the energy industry. Realized losses from its energy-exposed investments could very easily offset its non-energy gains, and then some. Direct exposure is relatively easy to measure -- it reports that energy-related companies (oil and gas production and equipment and services companies) made up about 7.7% of assets at the end of the last quarter. Much more difficult to quantify is its indirect energy exposure. Located in Houston, Main Street has naturally invested in companies that operate in areas where energy companies are important drivers of the local economy. Energy is to Houston and surrounding areas what Wal-Mart is to Bentonville, Arkansas. Though Bentonville's best car mechanic may not collect a paycheck from Wal-Mart, its performance certainly has an impact on local demand for his services. You get the point. I've been keeping an eye on some of its indirect exposure by keeping tabs on the dividends Main Street Capital earns from its portfolio companies. Operating earnings from recurring sources of income weakened over the last year, and the company is increasingly relying on dividends from its investments to pay dividends to its shareholders. Some portfolio companies that do not have a direct link to oil prices -- they aren't in the business of drilling for oil -- have indirect exposure to oil prices, and have been writing smaller dividend checks to Main Street in recent quarters. Main Street's three-part health exam When Main Street Capital reports earnings on Nov. 4, there are a few trends investors should pay particularly close attention to. The first is the most obvious: How does Main Street Capital's operating income compare to its current dividends it pays investors? Dividend coverage has deteriorated, and it's walking a very fine line on covering its routine dividends to shareholders with recurring operating income. Second, how much of the company's recurring earnings are non-cash in nature? Notably, non-cash payment in kind (PIK) interest nearly doubled in the first six months of 2016 from the first six months of 2015, and now makes up about 5.5% of its operating income. PIK income is interest or dividend income that is paid in additional debt or equity securities rather than cash. Stressed borrowers often elect (when allowed) to "pay" interest to their creditors by rolling the interest into the loan. Cash is always preferably to PIK.  Finally, Main Street Capital's dividend income earned from its equity investments is an excellent barometer for the health of the companies in which it owns an equity stake. Fluctuations in dividend income earned from its equity investments will likely foreshadow gains or losses in its investment portfolio. As with any high-yield stock in the financial industry, I believe investors' time and energy are best spent trying to rule out risks to the downside rather than painting rosy pictures of what the upside could be. If you can rule out the risks, the upside will roll in as monthly dividends. Main Street's quantity of operating earnings (net investment income) and the quality of its earnings (cash vs. non-cash income) should take a front seat, particularly as dividend coverage has been trending in the wrong direction.     Jordan Wathen has no position in any stocks mentioned.

The deep investment in big data gathering and analytics is fueled by an ability to create added value for companies based on actionable business insights, and to create added value for consumers by providing lifestyle benefits. While gathering and analyzing data comes at a substantial cost, the return can be great for businesses and impacts almost every facet of business operations. Targeted and Timely Marketing Big data's marketing promise is companies working together on analytics for tailored marketing capabilities that reach the right people at the right time. Predictive analysis can provide more targeted advertising, on-device couponing, service reminders in vehicles or appliances, or more rewarding perks and programs based on actual usage trends. Through data-driven insights, brands can take advantage of cross-sell and upsell opportunities. Other marketing and sales tactics include more targeted and timely offers to increase a brand's ability to attract new customers, and to retain those they already have. Value-added services improve the customer experience in ways that garner greater customer loyalty. Companies that know their customers better have a competitive advantage: They can deploy a highly targeted offer rapidly -- often faster than their competitors. Media services such as Netflix and Pandora have disrupted their industries not just through their streaming models, but through the ways they have innovated personalized recommendations that significantly increase duration of engagement. In the retail sector, near real-time analysis of both in-store and online purchasing behaviors leads to faster insights into demand shifts. Stores can adjust merchandise stock levels, pricing and bundled offers to take advantage of shifts before their competitors do. Amazon and Walmart employ big data analytics to optimize their supply chains, resulting in improved product availability and delivery to the consumer. Retailers also use video analytics and data from consumers' mobile devices to analyze in-store shopping patterns and adjust store layout to optimize traffic flow and product placement. Anticipating Customer Service Needs The volume and velocity of quality performance data, coupled with always-on connectivity, enables improved customer service. Machine-to-machine automation enables the real-time aggregation of performance data from thousands of devices. That in turn enables the rapid deployment of over-the-air application updates to address error codes and security threats, or to deliver enhanced services based on actual usage. Convenient access to their account, service, and delivery information is becoming a standard customer expectation. When brands respond quickly to anticipate and manage customer expectations, that improves their experience. Communication systems that enable the choice of mediums and provide automated or personalized messages for customer service or product updates reduce the number of in-bound customer service calls and increase overall satisfaction. The expensive, time-consuming and often risky process of product research and development is enhanced when consumer data, quality-of-performance data, and predictive analytics can be integrated across marketing, product design, manufacturing and testing. By enabling concurrent engineering and advanced modeling of product usage, companies can streamline time to market significantly, while improving product quality and chances of adoption. Revolutionizing Business Models The availability of product usage data also is pushing new data-driven business models. Access to device data provides original equipment manufacturers the opportunity to transform a traditional relationship with their customers. They can shift it from a one-off sale to an ongoing relationship that can take advantage of upsell opportunities and offer services that generate recurring monthly or annual revenue streams. Companies leveraging connectivity to introduce new business models include the following: Uber's simple but profound idea for connecting "I need a ride" people to "I'm looking for a fare" drivers resulted in a disruptive data-driven business that is revolutionizing public transportation. In the insurance industry, access to actual driving data, such as speed, braking pressure and cornering behaviors allows insurers to create better risk profiles for individual policy premiums. Insurers like Progressive are using usage-based insurance premiums to lure the best drivers away from competitors. Streaming music service Spotify leverages 600 Gigabytes of user-centric data per day to provide music recommendations or select the next song heard on its service. While some companies collect and manage user and device data internally, a host of Data as a Service and Analytics as a Service companies have emerged. These companies collect and aggregate data from an array of mostly free -- often social media -- data sources, and deliver the data to B2B customers via an API or Web dashboard. The sheer volume, real-time velocity, and variety of largely unstructured data being generated by smart home products make almost any data calculation a big data calculation. Companies are still trying to figure out how to translate all of this data into real business value, but the opportunity is there for applications in marketing, customer service and new business models.

CBS Boston reports that Joshua Hart, 23, and Brittany Smith, 27, were ordered held without bail at their arraignments on first-degree murder and several other charges in Orange District Court. The suspects are accused of killing 94-year-old Thomas Harty and severely wounding his wife, 77-year-old Joanna Fisher, in the couple’s home on October 5. Investigators said Hart and Smith attacked and robbed complete strangers. “These folks were minding their own business. They were living their life, they were watching TV that night,” said Northwestern District Attorney David Sullivan. “It was a home invasion of such epic proportions, it lasted almost two hours.” Harty was stabbed and suffocated with a pillow. Fisher was also cut and the two tried, but failed, to suffocate her, authorities said. She was left for dead and Hart and Smith stole the couple’s 2003 Toyota Corolla station wagon and drove off, according to the D.A. Surveillance at a WalMart in Worcester showed Hart and Smith allegedly used the couple’s stolen credit card just hours later, according to CBS Boston. Three days later they were found in a U-Haul truck that was parked in a WalMart parking lot in Rockbridge, Virginia, and arrested. Authorities also revealed the motive for the first time Friday. “This particular crime is alleged to have occurred because neither Miss Smith nor Mr. Hart wanted to return to jail or drug treatment,” said prosecutor Jeremy Bucci. Hart was afraid that his involvement in a stolen motor vehicle case earlier in the week would result in him being brought back to jail in either Massachusetts or Pennsylvania, Bucci said. Smith was due to be arraigned in the same stolen motor vehicle case and was also scheduled to report to drug treatment on Thursday, October 6. “They were looking for an older model vehicle without a tracking device inside of it, so that they could make good on their escape and they hoped that they could recover some money to help them escape,” Bucci said. “It is, without a doubt, that this crime was senseless,” Sullivan said.

Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via facebook dialog Share via Twitter Share via Pinterest Share via Pinterest Westend61 / Getty Images When you think of giving birth, you probably picture doing it in a hospital bed, at a birthing center, or maybe at home in a tub full of water. Instead of having her new baby in one of those expected settings, a woman named Cecelia Rivas suddenly gave birth to Matias, her third child, at a Utah Walmart. What's more, she was the epitome of an excellent customer, making sure to pay for her purchases before the baby came out. Rivas gave birth next to a cash register with the help of store employees shortly before 7:00 A.M. on Sunday. "When she went to the register, she was in distress, on her knees holding her stomach," the store’s manager, Dustin Haight, told ABC News. "Just before she went into full labor, she insisted on paying for her merchandise," he said. "We weren’t really interested in taking her money at [that] point, but she insisted...she paid and then had the baby. You can’t make that up. It was pretty funny." Rivas told the Daily Herald that she first felt contractions around 2:00 A.M. on Sunday and realized she didn’t have everything she needed for the baby. So, after insisting that her husband stay behind with their other children, she decided to go out and buy the necessary items. She felt her labor pains getting stronger at about 5:30 A.M., while she was checking out, but her water suddenly broke and she could feel the baby’s head. Rivas says she was “really surprised and really scared” but thanked everyone who helped her through the process. Carrie Coleman, M.D., an ob/gyn at Massachusetts General Hospital, tells SELF that these births are “not completely uncommon.” Lauren Streicher, M.D., an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, agrees and tells SELF that, while still rare, speedy childbirths happen in unexpected places more often than you’d think. She’s had patients deliver on their front lawns, in the elevator on the way to labor and delivery, and on the toilet. Maureen Whelihan, M.D., an ob/gyn at the Center for Sexual Health & Education, tells SELF that the majority of women who deliver this way have had a previous birth. “You can assume that the baby just came too fast,” she says. It’s pretty common for women to have a second, third, and subsequent babies faster than they did during their first delivery, Coleman explains. According to Streicher, your cervix opens faster during subsequent deliveries, which is why the birth process is typically a lot quicker. Contractions also work a little better after the first time around, she says, and may be less intense than they were during a first delivery. “Someone can have mild contractions—the kind you can sleep through—and by the time you start to have [strong] labor pains, the baby could be literally ready to come out,” she says. Your body also figures out the drill over time. “By the third birth, there is a lot of ‘memory’ in the pelvic floor, and the body responds to the forces of labor more quickly, so the patient can miss the opportunity to respond,” Whelihan says. That’s why ob/gyns on call will typically ask a patient in labor if this is their first pregnancy. “If it’s not, you’re going to have them come in sooner than you would if it was a first pregnancy,” Streicher says. Otherwise, a doctor may end up coaching a partner through the delivery process over the phone while the baby is born on the side of the road. “I can’t tell you how many times that’s happened,” Streicher says.

Tax cuts mean budget cuts, so what suffers is education, infrastructure and all kinds of things government does to make our lives better and our local businesses stronger. Republicans argue that pushing wealth and income to the top few has a "trickle down" effect. They say wealthy people (like Paris Hilton) are "makers" who "create jobs" and therefore deserve to have heaps of money pushed their way for their benefit. They say that government spending on things that make the lives of We the People better really just makes us into "takers." But in reality, policies that push more and more of our country's resources into the largest hands put our smaller hands at even more of a disadvantage. The giant corporations have huge advantages over small, local businesses just due to their size; huge tax breaks on top of their size-given advantages just make it that much harder for smaller businesses to compete. So the "WalMart business model" of undercutting and bankrupting a community's small businesses and draining entire regions of wealth gains even more power. After decades of these "trickle down" policies, this is also known as "look around you." Trump's Tax Plan Means Fewer Customers With Money To Spend At Local Businesses The Main Street Alliance is a "is a national network of small business coalitions" that "works to provide small businesses a voice on the most pressing public policy issues across the nation." (Donate here.) - Advertisement - A Main Street Alliance blog post by Stephen Rouzer, "Donald Trump's Revised Tax Plan Won't Work for Main Street," begins, "The latest version of Donald Trump's ever-changing tax plan is facing scrutiny from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and Main Street Alliance leaders. The plan, one that features across the board tax cuts, disproportionately benefits the highest-income earners, those grossing more than $1 million annually." This description of Trump's plans as a huge benefit to the wealthiest is based on a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) post explaining a Tax Policy Center (TPC) analysis of Donald Trump's tax proposals. The CBPP post, "Revised Trump Tax Plan Heavily Tilted Toward Wealthiest, Tax Policy Center Analysis Shows" explains how the analysis shows that Trump's tax cut raise the after-tax income of the already-wealthy by another 14% or more, while hardly benefiting the rest of us -- or even cutting the take-home incomes of the poorest. This would seriously affect small, local businesses. Rouzer explains how passing so much to the top few while starving the rest of us means local businesses have fewer customers with money to spend: "A 2015 report released by the Main Street Alliance, "Voices of Main Street," surveyed over 1000 small business owners and found that 52 percent of respondents cited 'more customers' as the most important key to increasing small business success. Doubling the number of respondents that said 'lower taxes' and more than quadrupling the number that responded 'fewer regulations.' - Advertisement - "Tax cuts skewed towards the wealthy elite starve our communities of much-needed resources while further tilting the scales towards large corporations and the rich." Rouzer concludes with some great comments from business owners: "'To level the playing field for Main Street businesses our tax code must no longer skew in favor of large corporations and their shareholders,' said Deborah Field, the owner of Paperjam Press in Portland, Oregon, and a former corporate tax accountant. 'Without holding multinational corporations accountable to pay what they owe and first providing relief to low and middle-income earners we shouldn't begin to consider tax cuts for the rich.'

Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Flipkart, the country’s largest home-grown e-commerce company, is slated to hit the road this quarter to raise a fresh round of capital, Mint reported this week. It hopes to raise at least $500 million and up to $1 billion, the report said citing unnamed sources. The report follows an earlier one in the Economic Times that said, also citing unnamed sources, that Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, is in talks to buy a stake in the Bengaluru-based company. Any kind of fund-raising by Flipkart is always something of an event in India’s start-up market. There are many who will insist otherwise. Flipkart, they argue, is no longer the benchmark for either funding or valuations. A lot of venture capitalists I meet also frequently complain about the media’s “unhealthy obsession” with reporting on start-up fund-raising at the exclusion of everything else, thus turning all matters funding into an event. But, here’s why start-up fund-raising and Flipkart’s in particular is so important. Between 2007 and 2015, venture capital-backed companies in India raised more than $15 billion from a variety of investors including venture capital firms, hedge funds and strategic investors, according to data compiled by VCCEdge. Flipkart, which started up in 2007, alone accounts for over $3 billion or roughly 20% of the overall capital drawn during this period. It has raised that money at astounding valuations. When it last raised capital, $700 million in July last year, its valuation was reported at $15.2 billion. In July, India’s venture capital market was still riding an unprecedented valuation wave and Flipkart was its flag-bearer. Things have changed since. The market has undergone a valuation correction. Again, Flipkart has led the way. Over the past few months, several foreign mutual funds that hold minority stakes in the company have successively marked down the value of their shares. Last reported, the e-commerce company’s valuation was estimated at around $9-10 billion. With the e-commerce sector bellwether falling out of favour with investors, the valuations and fund-raising prospects of several others in the market have been impacted one way or the other. The reported upcoming Flipkart fund-raising is interesting on two counts. One, the valuation at which it raises the next round of capital is going to influence future capital inflows into the e-commerce sector, the poster child of the ongoing start-up wave in the country. It could raise $1 billion at a valuation of $9-10 billion or more or it may muster just $500 million at a drastically lower valuation. Either way, it will give the e-commerce company, which is desperately battling Seattle based e-tailing giant Amazon for market dominance here, the runway to still prove to its investors that it can deliver the goods. Two, Flipkart’s success in raising funds, hopefully at a more than decent valuation, equally extends the runway for India’s venture capitalists. Also Read: The endgame for venture investing in India After more than 10 years of continuous investing, the venture capital market is yet to deliver a single blockbuster exit. Most firms active here have raised and deployed successive funds over the years without much to show so far in terms of returning profits to their investors. Let’s take a closer look at how much the top-rung firms currently manage between them. The 12 most active firms that invest from dedicated India funds have raised over $12 billion till date, based on data compiled from media reports and the websites of venture capital firms. Sequoia Capital India alone accounts for about $3 billion. It raised a massive $920 million fund earlier this year. Second in the pecking order, in terms of size, is Nexus Venture Partners, which now has more than $1 billion in funds under management. Next is Matrix Partners India with $710 million, followed by SAIF Partners at $700 million. These 12 firms represent investors who invest across the seed and alphabet rounds (Series A, B and C). Most of the capital they’ve raised has already been deployed, mostly in the consumer Internet sector. The concern for these investors and in turn for the start-up market is bringing in the next $12 billion. It is true that most of these venture capital firms have enough capital in reserve to see them through the next 2-3 years. But, after that the next tranche of funds will depend on a number of factors. How soon will the Indian start-up market begin to deliver supernormal returns on the investments that have been made so far? Will the flag-bearers of the current start-up wave go the distance and justify the investments made so far? How many among the 12 firms that have raised and deployed the $12 billion will survive? These are questions that don’t have easy answers yet. The Indian venture capital market is still young and the best assets are yet to be created. For that, uninterrupted access to early stage funds is paramount. The obsession with funding, Flipkart and valuations is going to be around for a while. There will always be time later to talk about the other stuff. Snigdha Sengupta is a consulting writer with Mint. She contributes stories on venture capital and private equity.

Todd Schnuck succeeded his brother Scott Schnuck (not pictured) as chief executive of Schnuck Markets, Inc. in 2014. Hucker became chief operating officer and president. Photo By David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com Schnucks, one of the biggest grocery chains in St. Louis, is the target of a boycott, faces a potential strike and has, in recent weeks, managed to anger some local nonprofit groups. Now the company is embroiled in a fight with one of its former top executives. Former Schnuck Markets president Anthony Hucker has filed suit against the chain and CEO Todd Schnuck for breach of contract, alleging he was terminated without cause after he was offered the CEO job at Save-A-Lot a year ago. In the lawsuit pending in St. Louis County Circuit Court, Hucker accuses the Maryland Heights-based company and Todd Schnuck of intentionally interfering with his employment prospects after Schnuck refused to waive a non-compete agreement Hucker signed when he was hired. After he was offered the CEO position at Earth City-based Save-A-Lot in October 2015, Hucker alleges that he approached Todd Schnuck, asking him to waive his non-compete agreement. Save-A-Lot, which is owned by Eden Prairie, Minn.-based SuperValu, has more than 1,300 stores in multiple states. After his meeting with Schnuck, Hucker alleges he emailed Schnuck to say he was willing to remain at Schnuck Markets if the company was unwilling to waive the non-compete agreement. “Todd Schnuck never responded, either verbally or in writing,” the lawsuit states. Instead of waiving the non-compete, Hucker was terminated without cause in November 2015, according to Hucker’s attorney Jerome Dobson, and caused him to lose the opportunity to be CEO of Save-A-Lot. “As a result of defendants’ tortious interference, (Hucker) has suffered lost wages, benefits of employment, and other employment compensation,” the lawsuit filed Sept. 22 says. A spokesman for Schnuck Markets said the company was aware of the lawsuit but did not comment on pending litigation. Hucker previously worked in leadership positions at Aldi, Wal-Mart Stores and Giant Food before joining Schnuck Markets’ executive ranks in 2013. Founded in 1939, Schnuck Markets has 99 stores in Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Iowa. When Hucker was promoted to president in September 2014, he became the chain’s first non-family member to hold the position. Non-compete agreements typically bar an employee from taking another job at a competitor, but Hucker doesn’t view Save-A-Lot, a discount grocery chain, as a competitor to Schnucks, according to his attorney.

Check our People in Business What's going up: Read the Building Blocks blog Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis See how St. Louis stocks are faring “Our position is they are not competitors,” Dobson said. “The people who shop at Save-A-Lot do not go to Schnucks. Schnucks’ competitors are Dierbergs stores.” Dobson did not specify an exact figure Hucker is seeking to recover, which includes severance, but said it was in excess of $100,000. “They terminated him, refused to pay him his severance and they wouldn’t release him from his non-compete,” Dobson said. Tucker moved to Florida after leaving Schnuck Markets and earlier this year was named chief operating officer of Southeastern Grocers, the parent company of multiple grocery chains operating in seven southeastern states, including Winn-Dixie and Harveys. The legal dispute is the latest controversy facing Schnucks, which is privately held. On Sunday, Schnucks completed the layoff of warehouse employees first announced in April that led to one of its unions, Teamsters Local 688, to boycott the chain beginning in June. After Local 688 union members’ picketing at the entrances of Schnucks stores protesting the layoffs, in August, the grocer ended its long-standing policy of allowing solicitors to stand at its doors. The solicitation ban drew criticism from groups including the Salvation Army that had raised funds for charity for years at the retailer. A Schnucks spokesman said earlier this year that the solicitation ban was not related to the union dispute but, rather, a redirection of its charity efforts from the front of the store to its My Schnucks Card (eScrip) fundraising program. Schnucks also is in the midst of a contract dispute with its largest union, Local 655 of the United Food and Commercial Workers, which represents thousands of checkers, stockers and other employees. Last month, Local 655 employees voted to reject Schnucks’ contract proposal and authorize a strike, and contract negotiations are continuing. The union said Friday that it planned to hold an employee meeting the week of Oct. 24 with an update on contract negotiations. Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

(Mark Gail/The Washington Post) By Emma Brown October 14 Follow @emmersbrown They’re in demand among parents who say traditional public schools have failed — but they’re not always successful. Their intense rate of growth has fueled an equally intense debate about the role they’ll play in the future of U.S. education. Advocates see their expansion as evidence that parents have a huge appetite for school choice. Critics see the beginning of the end of public education, with systems of neighborhood schools replaced by independent, privately run companies without the same obligation to teach the toughest students. A great deal of confusion surrounds charter schools. Here are some of the myths. Myth No. 1 Charter schools are everywhere. At its national convention this year, the NAACP called for a moratorium on charter school expansion. The Alliance to Reclaim Our Schools, a union-backed coalition, demands: “Stop flooding our communities with under-performing and unaccountable charter schools.” The charter debate is front and center in the education reform wars, and you’d think that they’re everywhere — a wave overtaking every community. Yes, the charter movement is growing. And charters have a significant market share in an increasing number of cities, with New Orleans (where 93 percent of students attend charters) leading the way, followed by Detroit (53 percent), Flint, Mich., (47 percent) and Washington (44 percent). Forty-three states and the District have laws allowing for charter schools. But in many parts of the country, charters are few and far between. About 3 million students are enrolled in approximately 6,800 charters, according to the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools. That’s only about 6 percent of all public school students. Eight states have no charter schools, and five have fewer than 10. The debate is loud, but the market share is still small. Myth No. 2 Charters are the brainchild of union-busting billionaires. Critics of charter schools often accuse philanthropists — including Microsoft founder Bill Gates, entrepreneur Eli Broad, hedge fund manager John Arnold and the Walton family, heirs to the Walmart fortune — of fueling the rise of charter schools and other reform projects as a way to promote free-market ideology and undermine teachers unions. In Salon early this year, Diane Ravitch (a George H.W. Bush-era federal education official who has become perhaps the nation’s most voluble charter critic) railed against Gates for using his wealth to push charters in Washington state. In the Huffington Post, Bill Bigelow argued that Charles and David Koch are involved with school reform because “they hate public schools.” It is true that deep-pocketed foundations have played a key role in the expansion of charter schools, through contributions to charters themselves and to the ecosystem of organizations that work with such schools. But charters were originally the brainchild of teachers union stalwart Al Shanker, who served as president of the American Federation of Teachers from 1974 to 1997. Shanker proposed charter schools in 1988, arguing that they would give small groups of teachers a way to dream up new methods of reaching the students for whom traditional schools were not working. Their successes and failures would hold lessons for other schools striving to improve. The first charter school opened in Minnesota in 1992. Some charters have acted as Shanker envisioned, but in many states they haven’t, rejecting requirements for teacher certification or barring collective-bargaining rights. Driven by a vision of market-based reform, charters have become not laboratories so much as competition meant to either spur traditional schools to improve or replace them. Just a few years after proposing charter schools, Shanker largely disavowed them, holding instead that schools would get better only by standardizing their goals — the same theory that underlies today’s controversial Common Core state standards . Myth No. 3 Charters are better than traditional schools. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is a big fan of expanding school choice via vouchers and charters. “We will rescue kids from failing schools,” he told the GOP convention in July. Books, articles and documentaries like “Waiting for ‘Superman’ ” have created in the popular imagination a picture of charter schools with impossibly long waiting lists, offering an escape to children desperate for a better education in neighborhoods beset by crumbling traditional schools. While it is true that some charter schools outperform traditional schools, it is also true that many charter schools fail. The Center for Research on Education Outcomes (CREDO) has produced a series of studies comparing academic results at charter and traditional schools. In 2013, CREDO found no difference nationally between traditional and charter schools in math, while in reading, the average charter school student gained the equivalent of an additional eight days of learning per year. But there was wide variation. Among the charters CREDO studied, 31 percent were significantly weaker in math than their traditional school counterparts, 29 percent were significantly stronger and 40 percent showed no real difference. CREDO studies also show variation across state lines. In cities, charters tend to fare better: The average student in an urban charter school gains the equivalent of 40 more days of learning in math and 28 additional days in reading. But the average charter student in Texas and in Ohio — a state that has been notorious for allowing poor-performing charters to persist — learns less in math and reading each year than her peers in traditional schools. Myth No. 4 Charter schools are public. Or private. In August , a National Labor Relations Board majority ruled that a charter school in Brooklyn “was not established by a state or local government” and was, therefore, “not itself a public school.” The board’s lone dissenter argued that “charter schools operate as K-12 public schools” and should be treated as such since “they are substantially regulated under state and local laws, and they are overseen by state and local authorities.” This is one of education’s more bitter feuds, a semantic battle that underlines how important public education is to our nation’s notion of itself. Advocates insist that charter schools are public because they are tuition-free and equally open to all children. Critics argue that charters are at the leading edge of an effort to privatize public education in the same way other government functions, such as prisons, have been outsourced to private companies. Neither side is entirely right. Charters are a hybrid, and judges and regulators have struggled to figure out how they should be treated under the law. “Courts have had a difficult time determining their legal status because they exhibit both public and private characteristics,” researchers wrote in a University of Massachusetts Law Review article last year. When charter students in Colorado, for instance, set a fire that destroyed private property, the property owners sued the school for negligence. The school argued that it was a public entity and therefore immune. A federal judge agreed, finding that the school’s autonomy did not make it a private institution. Often, the public- or private-ness of charter schools depends on state law. In many states, for example, charter schools are subject to sunshine laws, meaning their records and board meetings are open to the public. But not everywhere: In the District, for instance, charters are exempt from sunshine laws, which means journalists and parents often cannot access even basic information about how the schools spend taxpayer money. Myth No. 5 All charters employ zero-tolerance discipline. Many of the nation’s most heralded charter school networks were built as “no excuses” schools that practice a broken-windows approach to discipline. Children are expected to abide by strict rules — walking in silent lines, eating silent lunch, sitting up straight, maintaining eye contact with teachers as they move about the room — and are punished for even small infractions. The suspension rate among charters nationally was 16 percent higher than among traditional schools in the 2011-2012 school year, according to the Civil Rights Project at UCLA. But it has never been the case that all charter schools subscribe to the no-excuses, zero-tolerance philosophy. In the District in 2011-2012, the same year that charter schools were 72 times more likely than the traditional school system to expel a student, there were six charters that issued zero suspensions or expulsions, and 15 others that issued five or fewer. Lately — amid growing concern over feeding the school-to-prison pipeline with expelled students, and over producing graduates ill-equipped to deal with the freedom and responsibility of college life — there’s been a shift even among some stalwarts of the no-excuses approach. At Ascend charter schools in New York, kids no longer get in trouble for wearing socks that are the wrong color. In the District, charter schools’ suspension and expulsion rates are dropping. Some KIPP schools now use restorative justice, which prioritizes working through problems over doling out punishment. Even Education Secretary John King Jr. — whose charter school in Boston is known for both its high test scores and high suspension rates — delivered a speech this summer calling on charter leaders to rethink their approach to discipline.

While it is hard to believe that people would mistake the familiar fast food clown for a creeper, the public reputation of clowns as a whole is not particularly positive or even neutral right now. “McDonald’s and franchisees in local markets are mindful of the current climate around clown sightings in communities,” the company said in an email statement. “And as such are being thoughtful with respect to Ronald McDonald’s participation in community events for the time being.” McDonald’s isn’t placing an outright ban on public appearances by its red-nosed clown, a corporate spokesman said. But the company is “being thoughtful in regards to” Ronald McDonald’s appearances. There is no word on whether the clown will be paid for his time off. WOMAN GIVES BIRTH AT WALMART A woman was in the checkout line at the Payson, Utah, Walmart when she began to feel stomach pains. She was in labor. She asked a store employee to call 911. While on her knees, she still insisted on paying for her purchases. The unnamed woman completed the transaction, then laid down on the floor and gave birth before the paramedics arrived. Employees were excited to tell the story, and the store is planning to buy her a supply of diapers and other baby supplies. FLORIDA WOMAN VACUUMS GASOLINE, STARTS FIRE An explosion at the Shuttle Car Wash in Titusville, Florida, caused $500 in damage to a vacuum cleaner, but fortunately, no one was hurt. The explosion, around 5 p.m. Monday, was captured on surveillance cameras. Apparently, the woman was trying to vacuum up gasoline that was spilled in her trunk. As the vacuum machine was burning, she got in her car and drove away, and hasn’t been seen since. THIEVING RACCOON CAUGHT ON CAMERA Guy Williams tried to get some video of a raccoon he spotted on the campus of Bellarmine University in Kentucky. He had been feeding the raccoon acorns and even named him Stanley. Williams set his phone down while recording video in order to get a ground-level angle. Stanley grabbed the phone with his teeth and took off running with it. The phone continued to record as the raccoon ran away, with William’s yelling “Stanley!” as he gave chase. Stanley dropped the phone, apparently convinced that it did not taste that good. You can see the video here. CARS CRUSHED IN UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE A broken 24-inch water main caused flooding in the Crayford neighborhood of southeast London in Sunday. While thousands of homes were without water service, the streets were flooded. An underground parking garage took on so much water that a floor expanded and rose several feet- far enough to crush cars against the ceiling!  A number of vehicles crumpled after polystyrene insulation under the floor appeared to float or swell, forcing them into the concrete ceiling above. Flood water rose several feet at the newly-built car park below a block of flats in Crayford, south-east London. Residents said they had been warned if any of the cars were removed too hastily it could result in gas explosion. No one was injured, but more than a dozen cars are thought to be affected, some badly enough to be considered totaled. Can anyone explain why a parking garage has several feet of polystyrene insulation in the floor while the ceiling is concrete? You can see a news report on the flood here.

The bonds are expected to price via negotiated sale the week of Oct. 24, 2016 subject to market conditions. Proceeds will be used to refund outstanding obligations for savings. Additionally, Fitch has affirmed the underlying rating on the district's $764 million in outstanding ULTs and the district's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA+'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. SECURITY The bonds are payable from an unlimited property tax levy and are further secured by the PSF bond guarantee program, rated 'AAA' by Fitch. (For more information on the Texas Permanent School Fund see 'Fitch Affirms Texas PSF Rating at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable', dated Aug. 5, 2015.) KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'AA+' IDR and underlying ULT bond rating are based on Mansfield ISD's exceptional financial resilience, solid expenditure flexibility and strong growth prospects. The rating incorporates the district's moderate long-term liability burden. Economic Resource Base Mansfield ISD is located in the southeastern portion of Tarrant County and is directly connected to nearby Dallas and Fort Worth, the DFW International Airport, and surrounding communities by a robust and expanding transportation network. The city of Mansfield is located for the most part within the district boundaries. A small portion of the district extends into Johnson County and Arlington. The 2015 population is estimated at about 150,000, reflecting continued solid growth. Enrollment has been steady at about 33,000. The district's economic profile is characterized by high income and wealth levels. Revenue Framework: 'a' factor assessment Revenue growth prospects are strong, consistent with 10-year trends well in excess of U.S. GDP. Increases in the district's maintenance and operations (M&O) tax rate require voter approval. Expenditure Framework: 'aa' factor assessment The district's expenditures are likely to grow at a pace generally in line with revenue growth. The district's solid expenditure flexibility is derived from management of its workforce costs and is not impeded by moderate carrying costs. The majority of employer pension and other post-employment benefit contributions are borne by the state of Texas. Long-Term Liability Burden: 'aa' factor assessment Mansfield ISD's long-term liability burden is a moderate 15% of estimated personal income. The district's long-term liability is likely to remain moderate based on expected growth of regional debt at a pace consistent with population and income growth. The district's net pension liability represents a modest portion of its long-term liability burden. Operating Performance: 'aaa' factor assessment Fitch expects the district to demonstrate a high level of financial resilience in a moderate economic downturn based on its solid expenditure flexibility supplemented by reserves. The district's healthy financial cushion reflects a history of strong operating performance enabled by conservative budgeting practices. RATING SENSITIVITIES Growth Management: The rating is sensitive to the district's ability to continue to successfully manage growth as demonstrated by alignment of its recurring operating spending with revenues, and affordability of debt as reflected in the district's carrying costs and long-term liability burden. CREDIT PROFILE Mansfield ISD's taxable assessed valuation (TAV) realized strong 7.5% compound annual average growth (CAGR) for the 10 years ended in fiscal 2014, during which time enrollment grew an average of 4.6% per annum. The district's TAV growth continued at a strong 6.6% annual average clip for fiscal 2014 through 2017, during which time enrollment growth has decelerated due in part to lower enrollment yield per household and higher new home prices. New construction contributed 36% to the 7.7% increase in the district's fiscal 2017 TAV. Comprising most of the district's economic resource base, the city of Mansfield reports over 5,000 single family lots in various stages of development. These, along with multi-family developments are expected to contribute to the district's tax base expansion and enrollment growth over the next five years. Mansfield's economy is diversified across manufacturing, health and medical services, utility services, distribution, retail, property management, and leisure services. Large employers include Mouser Electronics, Methodist Mansfield Medical Center, SJ Louis Construction of TX, Wal-Mart Super Center and Klein Tools. Significant near term commercial, industrial and medical development and additional transportation improvements bode well for the city's ongoing economic growth. Revenue Framework Funding for public schools in Texas is provided by a combination of local (property tax), state and federal resources. The state budgets the majority of instructional activity through the Foundation School Program (FSP), which uses a statutory formula to allocate school aid taking into account each district's property taxes, projected enrollment and amounts appropriated by the legislature in the biennial budget process. The vast majority of districts are funded using a target revenue approach, whereby the combination of local and state funding for operations meets a predetermined per-pupil amount (which varies from district to district). Property taxes contributed 43% of the district's fiscal 2015 general fund revenues and state funding 56%. Mansfield ISD's revenues realized a 7% CAGR for the 10 years ending fiscal 2014, above the pace of U.S. economic performance for the same period. The growth reflected enrollment trends as well as the district's above-average TAV growth. The district has the ability to capture year-over-year tax base gains due to a one-year lag in state aid adjustments. Fitch anticipates the continuation of strong revenue growth based on local economic expansion and anticipated enrollment growth based on single-family construction plans. Similar to 93% of Texas school districts, Mansfield ISD's $1.04 per $100 of TAV M&O tax rate is at the statutory ceiling and as such has no independent legal ability to raise revenues. The district has the ability to seek an additional $0.13 M&O rate increase through a tax ratification election, although no immediate plans are in place. Expenditure Framework Instructional costs comprise 65% of the district's fiscal 2015 general fund operating expenditures, consistent with spending patterns of other districts in the state. Fitch expects the natural pace of the district's recurring operational expenditures to grow in line with to marginally above its revenues. The district general fund also includes pay-as-you go spending for selective capital projects and for its fleet and technology expenditures. The district maintains discretion over its labor costs, contributing to strong expenditure flexibility. Moderate carrying costs, representing 13% of governmental spending, do not pressure the district's operating budget. Fitch expects these to remain moderate based on proportional growth in the district's operations and debt service. The district's 10-year principal amortization is considered somewhat below average at about 40%. The assessment assumes ongoing state funding for the majority of employer pension and OPEB contributions. Mansfield ISD's pension contributions are currently limited to 1.5% of salaries and include pension contributions on the portion of salaries above the statutory maximum (total fiscal 2015 pension contribution of $5.7 million). Long-Term Liability Burden Mansfield ISD's $1 billion long-term liability burden is moderate at 15% of estimated personal income and is comprised primarily of debt ($970 million). The district has no debt authorization remaining. Depending on the outcome of facility planning committee underway, the district may seek additional authorization in May 2017. The district retains the independent legal ability to raise its interest and sinking (I&S) tax rate for payment of debt. The district's I&S rate of $0.47 per $100 of TAV and its expanding tax base provide capacity below the state's threshold of $0.50 for capital needs. Fitch expects the district's long-term liability burden to remain moderate, because population and income growth are likely to be aligned with additional debt needs. The district participates in the Teachers Retirement System of Texas (TRS), a cost-sharing multiple-employer pension system. Under GASB 67 and 68 reporting, TRS' assets covered 83.3% of liabilities as of fiscal 2015, a ratio that falls to a Fitch-estimated 75% using a more conservative 7% return assumption. The state assumes the majority of TRS employer contributions and net pension liability on behalf of school districts, except for small amounts that state statute requires districts to assume. Like all Texas school districts, Mansfield ISD is vulnerable to future policy changes that shift more of the contributions and liabilities onto districts, as evidenced by a relatively modest 1.5% of salary contribution requirement that became effective in fiscal 2015. The district's pension contributions are determined by state statute rather than actuarially and, like other Texas school districts, have historically fallen short of the actuarial level. Recent state reforms have lowered benefits and increased statutory contributions to improve plan sustainability over time. The proportionate share of the system's net pension liability paid by the district is minimal, representing about one-half of 1% of personal income. Operating Performance Fitch expects Mansfield ISD to demonstrate exceptional financial resilience during a moderate economic downturn given its healthy financial cushion and solid expenditure flexibility. Mansfield ISD targets a four-month reserve in excess of its three-month minimum policy reserve level through economic cycles and generally maintains structural balance of its recurring operations. To better align financial reporting with its operating cycle, the district changed its fiscal 2016 year end from August to June. This change contributes to an estimated $22 million net surplus as the fiscal year captured only 10 months of expenditures. The district is considering applying up to $15 million of its fiscal 2016 net surplus in fiscal 2017 for projects including a STEM academy and early childhood development center, as well as fleet purchases.

By Jan Miller October 14, 2016 11:46 AM Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Image of It’s called Christmas Creep by some. It’s not even a debate to many folks; it just makes them angry. But there’s a positive twist to this whole early Christmas shopping dilemma that we’re already seeing in Lubbock stores including Walmart, Hobby Lobby and Walgreens. First of all, if no one was buying it, retailers wouldn’t take up shelf space with it. So some of us must appreciate the head start on the holiday season. Every year I really want to do up Christmas in a big way, but somehow life is so hectic that I run out of time to get everything done the way I really want to early enough to relax and enjoy it. Let’s face it, all of our lives are much fuller than in the old days. We are juggling so many things that we need to start earlier on the big projects like Christmas if we don’t want to arrive at the actual day too completely exhausted to enjoy it. Maybe it’s too soon for gifts and a live Christmas tree, but it’s not too soon to make a plan and pull together some of the pieces, the ornaments and decor, the cards and wrapping paper, the boxes (oh boy, always scrambling for a box for something!) and the recipes. As a kid, I celebrated Christmas with my Grandparents and it was the best! Grandma had everything planned out to a T and she always started early. I remember for the really big dinners, Grandma and Mom and I would even set the table for supper in the morning. It was the complete and matched setting, including relish dish, bread plate, dinner plate, salad plate, soup bowl, multiple forks and spoons and engraved napkin holders. A wonderful handcrafted centerpiece and the best linen all made it a really special occasion. It’s the kind of attention to detail that we scarcely have time to think about anymore. But maybe, if we start early enough, we can remember all these things and lay out the plan in advance so we have the kind of old-fashioned Christmas we always dream of. Oh, and the energy and time to actually relax and enjoy it!

Well, Walmart has finally decided to sell them online with all four wave 2 deluxes (Wolfwire, Highbrow, Chromedome and Mindwipe) currently available on walmart.ca. While Toysrus.ca does not have them yet, they have a big 25% off sale on all Transformers in store (including Playskool for once, but not toys already on liquidation). Maybe this will help sell the ton of Combiner Wars boxsets that haven't moved yet. Credit(s): Toysrus.ca and walmart.ca Search Got Transformers News? Let us know here!

This was learnt first hand as I walked into Toysrus today, seeking a raincheck for the deal they had on Titans Return leader toys (at $35 CAD), and was told that corporate has decided that rainchecks will no longer be given for Transformers items. There has allegedly been some foul play involving rainchecks and it got bad enough that Toysrus Canada has decided to stop this practice entirely. This was discovered in Quebec so let us know if you hear the same at your local Canadian Toysrus. UPDATE It seems it is only select Toysrus stores in the Quebec area. There is no widespread change in the policy, as confirmed by Ontario managers. This seems more like a case of managers passing their own rules as corporate mandate when it isn't the case.

I raincheck is typically a small paper form that a retailer will fill out when they have a sale on an item, but are out of stock for that item. It basically extends the sale price to some future date (30 days, 90 days, etc.) so that when the item is in stock again, you can get it at the sale price even if the sale is over.

It will have to go back to the old system now of seeing the toy in the store and waiting for the deal rather than getting it right away with my raincheck. The thing Kurona (and this may be why they did this) is that all Transformers of a certain class in a line have the same number. So even if Wolfwire and Breakaway are different toys, TRU will see them as the same item. So I would ask for a raincheck for the item number and get a coupon that said I had 90 days to get a deluxe for, say, $10. And then I would be able to get the new deluxe right away for $10 when I found him in a store (even though he technically had not come out yet when the sale was on). So that was fun. but now its over. it will be like the states and the UK now where I have to wait for a sale to get the item I want and I will be restricted to what their selection.

Tim Morris is spearheading the local Wreaths Across America event to recognize service men and women buried in the cemetery at 7800 Van Belle Road. “We’re looking to get a wreath for every single veteran in our cemetery,” Morris said Thursday. “We’ll be doing a fundraiser; we’ll be out there selling wristbands to raise money for these wreaths.” The wreaths will cost approximately $12,500. Wreaths Across America supporters will begin offering 13,000 wristbands for donations of $1 or more in front of Walmart, 2675 E. Lincoln Ave., beginning next week. In addition to asking store customers to purchase a wristband in honor of area veterans, Morris said supporters will also be conducting a drawing for two barbecues — one donated by Walmart and one by Ace Hardware. Entry into the drawing is free, Morris said, noting he hopes that will help attract attention to the local Wreaths Across American program. Morris said the wreaths have to be purchased by Nov. 28 for delivery in December or January. But he won’t be waiting that long to have an official Wreaths Across America ceremony. “The official ceremony will be at 9 a.m. Dec. 17 at the cemetery,” he said, noting Veterans of Foreign Wars members will be on-hand to recognize service members buried in Lower Valley Memorial Gardens. Morris does not recommend sending checks to the national Wreaths Across America office as donations will go toward a general fund account, and not necessarily be earmarked for recognition of Sunnyside veterans. Instead, he said, area residents who want to donate to the program can stop by the cemetery or mail a check to Wreaths Across America, C/O Lower Valley Memorial Gardens, P.O. Box 936, Sunnyside, WA 98944. Make checks payable to Wreaths Across America.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- For the second time since 2014, a Monroe County auditor has been accused of using a county credit card for personal expenses. Steven Saulter, who resigned as auditor in June, is accused of purchasing $620-worth of food and prescription medications for his personal use with a Monroe County credit card between September 5 and October 10 of last year. In a probable cause affidavit filed this week, Saulter is accused of making 33 different charges on the county credit card for personal use during that period. The purchases were allegedly made mostly at Kroger, Marsh and Walmart stores. A Monroe County Sheriff's detective who interview Saulter said he was "cooperative" and admitted to using the card for his personal use, but "stated it was a misunderstanding." "He had been under a lot of stress at the time due to some personal issues, and apparently had 'accidentally' used the county credit card in lieu of his personal debit card, as they looked similar," the affidavit states. The detective notes he compared a card identical to the county card Saulter used to his personal debit card and noticed several distinct differences. Saulter was charged Monday with three counts of fraud and one count of official misconduct. All four counts are level 6 felony offenses. Saulter, a Democrat, replaced former Monroe County auditor Amy Gerstman, who pleaded guilty in September 2014 to felony official misconduct and misdemeanor conversion for using county-issued credit cards for personal purchases. She was sentenced to three months home detention in that case. Just months later, former Monroe County human resources director Rhonda Foster pleaded guilty to conversion for her own alleged misuse of her Monroe County-issued credit card. According to a probable cause affidavit in that case, Foster used a county Visa card to pay her personal property taxes in Delaware County, as well as personal expenses at Macy's and Lowe's.  Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc.

Early buying interest may be generated in reaction to upbeat earnings news from financial giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Traders are also digesting closely watched reports on retail sales and producer prices. U.S. stocks ended Thursday's session lower but well off the lows of the morning, as a rebound in oil prices helped temper the negativity trigged by concerns about slowing global growth in the wake of weak Chinese trade data. The Dow Industrials ended down 45.26 points or 0.25 percent at a 2-week low of 18,099, the S&P 500 Index closed 6.63 points or 0.31 percent lower at a 1-month low of 2,133 and the Nasdaq Composite also closed at a 1-month low of 5,213, down 25.69 points or 0.49 percent. Twenty-three of the thirty Dow components closed lower for the session, while seven stocks advanced. Chevron (CVX), Goldman Sachs (GS), Pfizer (PFE) and DuPont (DD) were among the biggest decliners of the session. However, Wal-Mart (WMT) and Merck (MRK) rose strongly. Among the sectors, computer hardware, semiconductor and financial stocks came under selling pressure, but gold, utility and airline stocks gained ground. On the economic front, the Labor Department reported that jobless claims remained unchanged at the previously week's revised level of 246,000 in the week ended October 8th. Economists expected claims to have risen to 254,000 from the 249,000 originally reported for the previous week. The four-week average fell to 249,250 from 252,750. Continuing claims calculated with a week's lag fell by 16,000 to 2.046 million in the week ended October 1st. A separate Labor Department report showed that import prices rose 0.1 percent month-over-month in September, in line with estimates, following a 0.2 percent drop in August. Annually, prices were down 1.1 percent. Fuel import prices rose 1.2 percent month-over-month. Excluding fuel, import prices were largely unchanged. At the same time, export prices climbed a bigger than expected 0.3 percent following a 0.8 percent drop in August, rendering the annual rate to a negative 1.5 percent. Non-agricultural export prices were up 0.4 percent. Commodity, Currency Markets Crude oil futures for November delivery are climbing $0.38 to $50.82 barrel after rising $0.26 to $50.44 a barrel on Thursday. The gain of Thursday came amid reaction to weekly petroleum inventory data showing a build in crude stockpiles for the first time in about 1-1/2 months. The Energy Information Administration's weekly petroleum status report for the week ended October showed that crude oil stockpiles increased by 4.9 million barrels to 474 million barrels. Stockpiles were at historically high levels for this time of year. Meanwhile, distillate inventories declined by 3.7 million barrels but were above the upper limit of the average range for this time of the year. Gasoline inventories fell by 1.9 million barrels last week but were above the upper limit of the average range. Refinery capacity utilization averaged 89 percent over the four weeks ended October 7th compared to 90.8 percent for the four weeks ended September 30th. Gold futures are currently trading at $1,252.80 an ounce, down $4.80 from the previous session's close of $1,257.60 an ounce. On Thursday, gold rose $3.80. On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 104.29 yen compared to the 103.71 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Thursday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1010 compared to yesterday's $1.1056. Asia The major Asian markets rebounded from the previous session's losses, as traders digested catalysts such as Chinese inflation data and oil's advance. The Japanese market rose, as the yen weakened further and traded above the 104-level against the U.S. dollar in the Asian session. The Nikkei 225 Index saw some volatility until early afternoon trading, moving back and forth across the unchanged line. After moving decisively positive, the index moved steadily higher for the rest of the session. The index ended up 82.13 points or 0.49 percent at 16,856. Construction, export and financial stocks moved mostly to the upside. However, food, chemical, pharma and utility stocks came under selling pressure. Australia's All Ordinaries Index moved about in a volatile manner throughout the session before ending nearly flat. The index was up 0.20 points at 5,519 at the close of trading. Financial, material and IT stocks lost ground in the session, with the weakness offset by gains by the remaining sectors. China's Shanghai Composite Index rebounded in last minute trading, ending up 2.46 points or 0.08 percent at 3,064, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index added 202.01 points or 0.88 percent before ending at 23,233. On the economic front, data released by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics showed that annual inflation accelerated to 1.9 percent in September from 1.3 percent in August, although it remained below the 3 percent central bank target. Economists expected a 1.6 percent rate. Meanwhile, Chinese producer price inflation returned to positive territory for the first time in more than four years. Producer prices edged up 0.1 percent in September in contrast to a 0.8 percent fall in the previous month. Prices were expected to fall 0.3 percent. Meanwhile, a Bank of Japan report showed that corporate goods prices fell in line with expectations on a year-over-year basis, although the pace of decline slowed. Europe European stocks are rebounding strongly after declining for three sessions in a row. While the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index has climbed by 0.9 percent, the German DAX Index and the French CAC 40 Index are up by 1.6 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively. In major corporate news, German business software firm Software AG confirmed its outlook for fiscal 2016, citing growing relevance in key markets, increasing maintenance revenues and a strong project pipeline. Hedge-fund operator Man Group reported that its funds under management increased by 6% to $80.7 billion as of September 30th compared to $76.4 billion as of June 30th. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) reported that its September sales totaled nearly 90,900 units, an increase of 14.2% year-over-year. FCA said the monthly performance in Europe significantly outperformed the industry average increase of 7.3%. On the economic front, the euro area trade surplus increased in August, as exports grew faster than imports, figures from Eurostat showed. The seasonally adjusted trade surplus rose to 23.3 billion euros in August from 20.8 billion euros in July. Economists had expected a surplus of 20.4 billion euros for the month. The U.K. Office for National Statistics reported that construction output declined more than expected in August. Construction output dropped 1.5 percent in August from July, when it rose by a revised 0.5 percent. Data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association showed Europe's passenger car sales volume rose to its highest September level on record. Passenger car registrations increased 7.2 percent in September from the prior year to 1.45 million units. Nonetheless, the pace of increase was slower than the 10 percent growth seen in August. U.S. Economic Reports After reporting a modest drop in U.S. retail sales in the previous month, the Commerce Department released a report on Friday showing that sales rebounded in line with economist estimates in the month of September. The Commerce Department said retail sales climbed by 0.6 percent in September after edging down by a revised 0.2 percent in August. Economists had expected sales to rise by 0.6 percent compared to the 0.3 percent drop originally reported for the previous month. Excluding a jump in auto sales, retail sales still rose by 0.5 percent in September after dipping by 0.2 percent in August. The increase in ex-auto sales also matched estimates. A separate report from the Labor Department showed that producer prices increased by slightly more than anticipated in September. The Labor Department said its producer price index for final demand climbed by 0.3 percent in September after coming in unchanged in August. Economists had expected prices to edge up by 0.2 percent. Excluding food and energy prices, core producer prices rose by 0.2 percent in September after inching up by 0.1 percent in August. Core prices had been expected to show another 0.1 percent uptick. The Commerce Department will release its business inventories report for August at 10 am ET. Economists expect a 0.1 percent increase in business inventories. Business inventories remained virtually unchanged in July compared to the previous month. Annually, inventories climbed 0.5 percent. Business sales edged down 0.2 percent month-over-month and were 0.8 percent lower than last year. The business inventories/sales ratio rose to 1.39 in July from 1.37 in the year-ago period.

Large class sizes. Untreated drug addictions. A ballooning deficit in state pension accounts. What if you could tackle several of Oregon’s chronic funding issues in one shot? About The Measure 97 Project This fall, voters will consider higher taxes on companies that do more than $25 million in Oregon sales each year. Proponents say it is the solution to a generations-old problem and will provide needed revenue to schools and other basic public services. Opponents say it’s a thinly disguised sales tax that will hurt large and small businesses.   This week, OPB and The Oregonian/OregonLive are teaming up to take a deeper look at Measure 97 — and what it means for you. 1) Measure 97: How We Got Here 2) How Measure 97 Would Impact Oregon Businesses That’s what the backers of Measure 97 have in mind with a one-of-a-kind tax engineered to make large corporations pay the bills for several state programs. They say the $3 billion in new cash expected each year would build up the state by forcing businesses to contribute taxes more equitably. The money doesn’t come out of thin air, though, and it may not be just large corporations paying the bills. Consumers across Oregon will wind up paying, too — even if how much, and for what, remains entirely unclear. Utilities, for example, have a legal right to pass along higher costs to their customers. But some academics and economists expect consumers will end up paying more for everything from cable TV to gas and groceries. “I think that’s almost certainly the case and I don’t think anyone really disagrees with that. The issue is: How much?” said Fred Thompson, a professor of public policy at Willamette University. Because of the way initiative backers wrote the tax, exempting certain businesses while taxing others, some prices may rise more than others. Predictions, though, vary considerably. ‘A Giant Step In The Dark’ A study by the nonpartisan Legislative Revenue Office last spring estimated the total cost to a typical Oregon family might be $600 a year in higher prices and, for some kinds of jobs, diminished wage growth. Supporters have countered that prices set nationally are unlikely to change. “It really is a giant step in the dark,” Thompson said. “There is no tax anywhere in the world that works like this one.” Ben Unger, the former Democratic lawmaker now leading the Yes on 97 campaign, argues the tax is “designed to be a noticeable reinvestment, to restore what’s wrong.” “And in order to do that,” Unger said, “everyone knows we’re talking about billions of dollars in reinvestment, not millions.” Here’s what makes the measure unusual: The initiative creates a 2.5 percent tax that applies to most sales in Oregon above a $25 million annual threshold. Few other states have a gross receipts tax like this, and no one has a tax rate this high. Most sales taxes, which are similar to a gross receipts tax, exempt wholesale trades, like when a grocery store purchases beer from a distributor. Measure 97 has no such exemption, so that could create a “pyramiding” effect, with new taxes piled atop one another at each level of the supply chain – potentially triggering price hikes greater than the 2.5 percent tax. A conventional sales tax charges the tax at the cash register, and consumers see it every time they make a purchase. Measure 97 embeds the tax in the cost of the product, so it’s not apparent how much – if any – of the added cost retailers pass on to consumers. Sales taxes generally exempt food from taxation. Measure 97 does not, though its supporters insist grocers would not pass their higher taxes to consumers. Some businesses are exempt from the tax – partnerships, for example, and companies organized for “public benefit.” If two companies in the same industry are taxed at different rates, what happens to prices? Neither New Seasons nor WinCo would pay the tax, for example, but Safeway, Fred Meyer, Walmart and Costco all would. RELATED COVERAGE Measure 97: How We Got Here So if WinCo keeps its prices fixed, does that mean Fred Meyer has to absorb the cost of the tax to remain competitive? Or does it mean that Fred Meyer raises prices to cover its higher costs and WinCo matches, taking a higher profit? At this point, Thompson said, the answers are theoretical. He said academics would love to study Measure 97 in action, but warns consumers may not be pleased. “I really find it intellectually exciting,” said Thompson, who said he will be voting against the tax. “I just wish these exciting experiments were carried out somewhere else, rather than where I live.” Oregonians Split Polls show Oregonians closely split on the measure as they weigh the benefits of boosting state support for schools and other key services against the initiative’s implications for businesses, and its impact on pricing. Though lawmakers will face pressure to spend the new money as directed, that’s not guaranteed.                                                       Dairy farmer Bobbi Harold Frost thinks Measure 97 is simply a sales tax in disguise. She'll vote against it. Kristian Foden-Vencil/OPB To Bobbi Harrold Frost, a dairy farmer in Creswell, Measure 97 is a sales tax in disguise. She’s opposing it, worried the tax would compound down the supply chain and eat into her family’s budget. “It’s like being able to go and visit my husband’s family in Utah at the holidays,” Harrold Frost said. “That’s travel money. That’s plane-ticket money.” Monmouth retiree Patty Taylor-Dutcher is all in, lamenting the current state of Oregon schools. “I’m just such a believer in education, because I’ve seen the benefits of education among my own family,” she said. “And I’ve seen the sad outcomes when kids aren’t well educated and aren’t prepared for any jobs.” Her husband, Don Dutcher, is wary of what the measure would mean for prices. But he said he’s leaning toward supporting it, even if he’s not happy about it. “I suspect deep down that I will support the measure. But I’m going to be thinking of every reason why I shouldn’t,” he said, right up until he marks his ballot. Retired Monmouth couple Don Dutcher and Patty Taylor-Dutcher think they'll probably end up voting for Measure 97. Kristian Foden-Vencil/OPB Opponents are quick to assert consumers will pay more under Measure 97 – tossing out numbers as high as a 6 percent spike in grocery prices. It’s all guesswork, though, and the measure’s backers scoff at the notion of any price hike at all. The Yes on 97 campaign points to newspaper ads that show groceries advertising the same prices across states, and say big retailers aren’t likely to create a separate pricing structure just for Oregon and won’t raise prices in the rest of the country to offset a new tax in a relatively small state. “They set their prices nationally so I doubt it’s really going to have an impact on the consumers,” agrees Roberta Mann, a tax law professor at the University of Oregon who supports the measure. She testified about the initiative’s impact before a citizens commission that voted narrowly to support Measure 97. Pressed on the measure’s benefits, backers will talk only in general terms. How many more school days each year? How many fewer kids in the average class? Supporters won’t even guess. But they insist families will enjoy real, tangible benefits. “They might notice that their kids are in school a bit more and they might notice they can reach the teacher a little bit more readily because the teacher isn’t trying to juggle 35 to 45 kids in the classroom,” said Tonia Hunt, executive director, Children First for Oregon. “They might notice that they can get into the doctor’s office for preventive care, not just for emergency care.” Pyramids And Offsets Yet nothing about Measure 97 is undisputed. Take the utility taxes: Oregon law allows a regulated utility like Portland General Electric to pass along its costs to customers. In a filing with Oregon’s utility commission, the utility says it plans to do that if Measure 97 wins — passing along not only the cost of the tax, but also added costs from the “pyramiding” effects as suppliers and contractors hike their own prices to cover the tax. By the utility’s reckoning, that works out to a 3 to 4 percent increase altogether — $30 a year for a typical electric customer. Of course, the utility has an incentive to make its estimate as high as possible, leaving it to regulators to deny an increase if they find it unjustified. RELATED COVERAGE How Measure 97 Would Impact Oregon Businesses Still, with taxes driving up costs, it might seem clear that families will pay for that on their electric bills. Not so, Measure 97 supporters insist. The initiative’s backers say they will ask regulators to offset every penny of the added costs. Regulators can do that, supporters of the measure say, by collecting deferred taxes they feel the utilities should already pay. Some of the measure’s backers, including Gov. Kate Brown, say it should be obvious to voters that they will bear some of the initiative’s costs. Mann acknowledged companies with significant market power and little competition, like Comcast, would probably pass along at least a portion of the cost. The state study of the initiative’s impacts found the retail and wholesale sectors would bear the biggest impacts from the tax hike, more than $1.1 billion a year. Wholesale taxes alone would increase nearly sevenfold, adding a major new cost to the supply chain for products sold in Oregon. “It will work its way to consumers,” Mann. “The pyramiding issue is that it just multiplies as it works its way to consumers.” Still, Mann said, businesses in Oregon pay relatively low taxes. She said she would have structured the initiative differently but will vote for Measure 97 in the absence of an alternative. “It’s worth a try because these are corporations that are getting away without paying taxes, or paying a low, low amount of taxes,” Mann said.

Families weigh uncertain costs, benefits Print Email Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive The Oregonian Email the author | Follow on Twitter on October 14, 2016 at 5:11 AM, updated October 25, 2016 at 3:35 PM comments "It really is a giant step in the dark. There is no tax anywhere in the world that works like this one." — Fred Thompson, a professor of public policy at Willamette University By Mike Rogoway | The Oregonian/OregonLive and Kristian Foden-Vencil | Oregon Public Broadcasting Short school years. Large class sizes. Untreated drug addictions. A ballooning deficit in state pension accounts. What if you could tackle several of Oregon's chronic funding issues in one shot? That's what the backers of Measure 97 have in mind with a one-of-a-kind tax engineered to make large corporations pay the bills for several state programs. They say the $3 billion in new cash expected each year would build up the state by forcing businesses to contribute taxes more equitably. The money doesn't come out of thin air, though, and it may not be just large corporations paying the bills. Consumers across Oregon will wind up paying, too — though how much, and for what, remains entirely unclear. Utilities, for example, have a legal right to pass along higher costs to their customers. But some academics and economists expect consumers will end up paying more for everything from cable TV to gas and groceries. "I think that's almost certainly the case and I don't think anyone really disagrees with that. The issue is: How much?" said Fred Thompson, a professor of public policy at Willamette University. Because of the way initiative backers wrote the tax, exempting certain businesses while taxing others, some prices may rise more than others. Predictions, though, vary considerably. A study by the nonpartisan Legislative Revenue Office last spring estimated the total cost to a typical Oregon family might be $600 a year in higher prices and, for some kinds of jobs, diminished wage growth. Supporters have countered that prices set nationally are unlikely to change. "It really is a giant step in the dark," Thompson said. "There is no tax anywhere in the world that works like this one." Ben Unger, the former Democratic lawmaker now leading the Yes on 97 campaign, argues the tax is "designed to be a noticeable reinvestment, to restore what's wrong." "And in order to do that," Unger said, "everyone knows we're talking about billions of dollars in reinvestment, not millions." An unusual tax Here's what makes the measure unusual: The initiative creates a 2.5 percent tax that applies to most sales in Oregon above a $25 million annual threshold. Few other states have a gross receipts tax like this, and no one has a tax rate this high. Most sales taxes, which are similar to a gross receipts tax, exempt wholesale trades, like when a grocery store purchases beer from a distributor. Measure 97 has no such exemption, so that could create a "pyramiding" effect, with new taxes piled atop one another at each level of the supply chain — potentially triggering price hikes greater than the 2.5 percent tax. A conventional sales tax charges the tax at the cash register, and consumers see it every time they make a purchase. Measure 97 embeds the tax in the cost of the product, so it's not apparent how much — if any — of the added cost retailers pass on to consumers. Sales taxes generally exempt food from taxation. Measure 97 does not, though its supporters insist grocers would not pass their higher taxes to consumers. Some businesses are exempt from the tax — partnerships, for example, and companies organized for "public benefit." About this series The Oregonian/OregonLive and Oregon Public Broadcasting have teamed up to examine Measure 97, a controversial proposal on the November ballot that would raise $3 billion a year by increasing taxes on certain large corporations. Sunday: A look at the tortured tax road -- and decades of budget choices -- that have Oregon voters staring at Measure 97's politically toxic fight. Wednesday: For some local businesses that sell in high volumes, but have low profit margins, the new tax could be very painful. Today: Consumers across Oregon will chip in for Measure 97, too. But precisely how much remains a mystery. If two companies in the same industry are taxed at different rates, what happens to prices? WinCo would not pay the tax, for example, but Safeway, Fred Meyer, Walmart and Costco all would. So if WinCo keeps its prices fixed, does that mean Fred Meyer must absorb the cost of the tax to remain competitive? Or does it mean that Fred Meyer raises prices to cover its higher costs and WinCo matches, taking a higher profit? At this point, Thompson said, the answers are theoretical. He said academics would love to study Measure 97 in action, but warns consumers may not be pleased. "I really find it intellectually exciting," said Thompson, who said he will be voting against the tax. "I just wish these exciting experiments were carried out somewhere else, rather than where I live." Oregonians split Polls show Oregonians closely split on the measure as they weigh the benefits of boosting state support for schools and other key services against the initiative's implications for businesses, and its impact on pricing. Though lawmakers will face pressure to spend the new money as directed, that's not guaranteed. To Bobbi Harrold Frost, a dairy farmer in Creswell, Measure 97 is a sales tax in disguise. She's opposing it, worried the tax would compound down the supply chain and eat into her family's budget. "It's like being able to go and visit my husband's family in Utah at the holidays," Harrold Frost said. "That's travel money. That's plane-ticket money." Monmouth retiree Patty Taylor-Dutcher is all in, lamenting the current state of Oregon schools. "I'm just such a believer in education, because I've seen the benefits of education among my own family," she said. "And I've seen the sad outcomes when kids aren't well educated and aren't prepared for any jobs." Her husband, Don Dutcher, is wary of what the measure would mean for prices. But he said he's leaning toward supporting it, even if he's not happy about it. "I suspect deep down that I will support the measure. But I'm going to be thinking of every reason why I shouldn't," he said, right up until he marks his ballot. Opponents are quick to assert consumers will pay more under Measure 97 — tossing out numbers as high as a 6 percent spike in grocery prices. It's all guesswork, though, and the measure's backers scoff at the notion of any price hike at all. The Yes on 97 campaign points to newspaper ads that show groceries advertising the same prices across states, and say big retailers aren't likely to create a separate pricing structure just for Oregon and won't raise prices in the rest of the country to offset a new tax in a relatively small state. "They set their prices nationally so I doubt it's really going to have an impact on the consumers," agrees Roberta Mann, a tax law professor at the University of Oregon who supports the measure. She testified about the initiative's impact before a citizen commission that voted narrowly to support Measure 97. Pressed on the measure's benefits, backers will talk only in general terms. How many more school days each year? How many fewer kids in the average class? Supporters won't even guess. But they insist families will enjoy real, tangible benefits. "They might notice that their kids are in school a bit more and they might notice they can reach the teacher a little bit more readily because the teacher isn't trying to juggle 35 to 45 kids in the classroom," said Tonia Hunt, executive director, Children First for Oregon. "They might notice that they can get into the doctor's office for preventive care, not just for emergency care." Utility hikes Nothing about Measure 97 is undisputed. Take the utility taxes: Oregon law allows a regulated utility like Portland General Electric to pass along its costs to customers. In a filing with Oregon's utility commission, the utility says it plans to do that if Measure 97 wins — passing along not only the cost of the tax, but also added costs from the "pyramiding" effects as suppliers and contractors hike their own prices. By the utility's reckoning, that works out to a 3 to 4 percent increase altogether — $30 a year for a typical electric customer. Of course, the utility has an incentive to make its estimate as high as possible, leaving it to regulators to deny an increase if they find it unjustified. Still, with taxes driving up costs, it might seem clear that families will pay for that on their electric bills. Not so, Measure 97 supporters insist.  The initiative's backers say they will ask regulators to offset every penny of the added costs. Regulators can do that, supporters of the measure say, by collecting deferred taxes they feel utilities should already pay. Some of the measure's backers, including Gov. Kate Brown, say it should be obvious to voters that they will bear some of the initiative's costs. Mann acknowledged companies with significant market power and little competition, like Comcast, would probably pass along at least a portion of the cost. The state study of the initiative's impacts found the retail and wholesale sectors would bear the biggest impacts from the tax hike, more than $1.1 billion a year. Wholesale taxes alone would increase nearly sevenfold, adding a major new cost to the supply chain for products sold in Oregon. "It will work its way to consumers," Mann. "The pyramiding issue is that it just multiplies as it works its way to consumers." Still, Mann said, businesses in Oregon pay relatively low taxes. She said she would have structured the initiative differently but will vote for Measure 97 in the absence of an alternative. "It's worth a try because these are corporations that are getting away without paying taxes, or paying a low, low amount of taxes," Mann said. Correction: This article has been corrected to note that Safeway is subject to Measure 97's taxes. The original version of the article stated, correctly, that Safeway is subject to the tax. Safeway then issued a statement that it was exempt. The grocer now says its statement was incorrect, and that it is not exempt from the tax. -- Mike Rogoway mrogoway@oregonian.com 503-294-7699 @rogoway -- Kristian Foden-Vencil kfv@opb.org 503 293 1977 @KristianOPB Insurance Guide 2017 Need help with open enrollment?

Rich Barlow weighs in on big agriculture, small farms and the food dilemma facing America and the world. Pictured: Central Illinois farmers harvest their corn crops Wednesday, Sept. 14, 2016, in Loami, Ill. (Seth Perlman/AP) Here’s a problem that’s gotten scant attention in the presidential campaign despite being as fundamental as breathing: How will we, and the world, feed ourselves? The question arises because of two challenges. First, the Obama administration, for all the good it’s done, has failed to tame the agricultural industrial complex, which harms our health, environment, wallets and livestock. Second, the United Nations says that we’ll have to double food production to feed the 9 billion humans expected to be on the planet in 2050. Guess who wants a piece of that action? That’s right: the ag industrial complex. While vanquishing government regulation, Big Food has had to bend, however gradually, to the marketplace. Writing in The New York Times, Michael Pollan offered a litany of the Obama administration's setbacks in dealing with Big Food, including having to drop proposed regulations against anti-competitive practices, despite public testimony from small ranchers and farmers; watching pliant congressional Republicans kill voluntary guidelines curbing the marketing of unhealthy food to kids; and, “for whatever reason,” as Pollan wrote, a decision to exempt agriculture from Obama’s effort to regulate greenhouse gases. Pollan noted one bright side: While vanquishing government regulation, Big Food has had to bend, however gradually, to the marketplace. The giants oppose requirements to label genetically modified food, but consumers overwhelmingly support such transparency. Meanwhile, reformers leaned on big food retailers — Walmart, McDonald’s, Burger King, Subway, Chipotle — to sign an agreement to raise wages and improve working conditions for Florida tomato pickers, “some of the most underpaid and ill-treated workers in the country,” according to Pollan. That capitalism is nudging the public interest in this instance will shock corporate apologists and Bernie Sanders’s fans alike. Still, it’s clear that regulators will have to step up their game in the future if Big Food’s big sins are to be rectified. Those are the hurdles on the domestic front. What about the international arena and the coming challenge of 9 billion mouths to feed? Doesn't bigger demand call for bigger production? Well, no. As the Environmental Working Group, a Washington, D.C.-based advocate of healthy, environmentally benign food and consumer products, points out, “Agribusinesses such as Monsanto sometimes cite the so-called ‘moral imperative’ to feed a world in order to defend the status quo farm policy and deflect attention from the destruction that ‘modern’ agriculture is inflicting on the environment and human health.” The deputy-general of the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization would seem to agree, arguing that, in fact, future needs render current agricultural practices unsustainable: “What we are still mostly seeing is a model of production that cannot prevent the degradation of soils and the loss of biodiversity — both of which are essential goods, especially for future generations.” The answer, then, is to help struggling countries feed themselves by aiding small farmers to up their production with environmentally sustainable practices. Big Food won't have a big role in feeding those hungry nations; UN data show that, measured by monetary value, a mere one-half of one percent of U.S. agricultural exports go to 19 countries with chronic hunger. What about the international arena and the coming challenge of 9 billion mouths to feed? Doesn't bigger demand call for bigger production? So if domestic and foreign needs demand reform, will the next president deliver? Donald Trump’s website ignores the issue, while Hillary Clinton’s calls for expanding existing programs to train future farmers and create local and regional farmers’ markets and food supply chains. Pollan is pessimistic. “Donald Trump professes to love fast food,” he wrote, “and Hillary Clinton has longstanding ties to Big Food: Tyson was one of Bill Clinton’s first political patrons, and as a lawyer in Arkansas, Hillary Clinton served on the board at Walmart. (Though as a New York senator, she worked hard on behalf of small upstate farmers, so perhaps there is hope.)” The question stands: How will we feed ourselves and the world? By electing a president who offers hope for reform; by leaning on a newly-elected president and Congress to embrace needed changes; and by exercising our rights as both consumers demanding better food, and as voters demanding better governance over how that food is produced.

Early Warning Systems Reveal Child Labor in Bangladesh’s Garment Industry by Leon Kaye on Friday, Oct 14th, 2016 Corporate Responsibility Share Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to print (Opens in new window) A young girl working at a garment factory in Bangladesh. Since the Rana Plaza factory collapse in 2013, apparel companies have scrambled to ensure their supply chains can become more responsible and free of labor and human rights abuses. While some progress has arguably been made, much work needs to be done if the fashion industry can genuinely say it is concerned about human rights. This is particularly true when it comes to child labor. Two mobile telephone systems, Laborlink and LaborVoices, address the problem. The systems allow workers to anonymously report signs of human trafficking, delayed wages and child labor. Garment workers simply call and reply to simple questions by pressing 1 for “yes” and 2 for “no” on a mobile device. Based on data recently released by LaborVoices, “1” has been pressed frequently enough to warn several of the world’s leading apparel brands that the clothes they source in Bangladesh have ties to child labor. LaborVoices’ data, which is collected by a platform called Symphony, covers worker reports from January to June of this year. So far, the information LaborVoice gathered includes about 85 factories in the system’s database, or approximately 3 percent of Bangladesh’s garment exports. That data is now the foundation of a heat map that pinpoints which factories score moderate, elevated or even high risks for use of child labor. Most of the factories are located around the country’s capital and largest garment-producing region, Dhaka, as well as Chittagong, a city of 2.5 million in Bangladesh’s southeast. LaborVoices’ data reveals that over 5,200 workers dialed into the system to date, reporting at least 500 incidents of child labor. The brands that could be affected by such abuses in their supply chains include Walmart, Target, C&A, Zara, Columbia, Nike, Adidas, H&M, Levi’s, Louis Vuitton and Tesco. The advantages of these systems is that they provide real-time information that is much faster than third-party audits, which the garment industry touts as a way to monitor their operations in Bangladesh. This data also helps Bangladesh garment workers locate factories that have a better reputation for working conditions and prompt payment in contrast to their current employers. Furthermore, LaborVoices and Laborlink provide valuable data for apparel companies as they seek to allay their stakeholders’ fears about clothes coming from factories with dubious human rights records. More data will be released in the next few weeks, one of LaborVoices’ team members (who wished to remain unnamed) told TriplePundit in an email. A larger sample size should help workers, and companies, identify which factories are more respectful of workers and which ones should be avoided. LaborVoices’ goal is to cover 10 percent of Bangladesh’s garment factories by 2016, with updated data released to the public every six months. LaborVoices recently launched a similar tool in Turkey, which has emerged as another global center for garment manufacturing as its garment exports approach $20 billion annually. Bangladesh’s garment sector is worth at least $24 billion, and according to the Economist, the country seeks to quadruple that value over the next two decades. Those figures alone should serve notice to the world’s clothing brands that they need to pay close attention to systems such as LaborVoices or Laborlink if they want to ensure their supply chains indeed have the integrity many of them are quick to claim. It is true that attitudes toward child labor vary by country, as the controversy over soccer balls made in Pakistan two decades ago revealed. But LaborVoices told TriplePundit that all of these reports of child labor occurred in Bangladeshi factories, not in homes. Considering the billions of dollars fashion brands score by sourcing from a country where the average worker does not even earn $100 a month, this is not just a wake-up call for companies to mitigate their risks. They also need to invest in training, social enterprise programs and education programs for these workers, who are the drivers behind an industry that is still rapidly growing and is immensely profitable.

Postman was launched in September 2013 by Abhinav Asthana (CEO), Ankit Sobti (CTO) and Abhijit Kane (product architect). Asthana, a former Yahoo intern, ran a panoramic photo app TeleportMe before launching Postman. Sobti is an ex-employee of Adobe while Kane had worked with Walmart Labs earlier. The firm has offices in Bangalore and San Francisco Since its inception, the firm claims to have more than three million active installations and a customer base that includes more than 1.5 million active monthly users at 30,000 companies. “We created Postman to address issues that I confronted personally as a developer, and our overwhelming market acceptance shows that this was a critical need. The need for Postman in an API developer’s workflow will only grow as this market expands,” said Asthana in the statement. The freemium version of the tool includes an app for Chrome, Mac and Windows, while it’s paid product, Postman Cloud, is a subscription service that provides additional collaboration, testing and documentation tools for both small and large development teams. Box, Walgreens, Intuit, IBM, VMware and Apigee are some of Postman’s clients. Postman had previously raised funds worth $1 million from Nexus Venture Partners in May 2015. Nexus Ventures’ previous investments this year include on-demand logistics service provider GoPigeon in September where it had put in $1.5 million (around Rs 10 crore) in a pre-Series A funding round. Nexus was also part of a funding round led by Sequoia Capital India in Silicon Valley-based cloud backup and data protection firm Druva Inc. The startup secured $51 million (Rs 340 crore) from new and existing investors. In August, Blume Ventures along with Nexus put in $7 million (Rs 47 crore) in food delivery platform Runnr.

News Sports Opinion Life Obituaries Classifieds Jobs Garage Sales November 14, 2016 | Today's Paper | Submit News | Subscribe Today County man has probation revoked at hearing Cops & Court Report Oct 14, 2016 A Warren County man had his probation revoked Thursday after a hearing before Judge Gregory Hammond. Jason Allen Seybert had been arrested on July 20 for probation violations, and was placed in the Warren County Jail. On Thursday, in the Warren County Main Courtroom, Assistant District Attorney told Hammond that his sole witness for the hearing would be Officer Mike Walters from the Warren County Adult Probation department. Gnage said the underlying charge from Seybert’s original sentencing on May 30, 2014, was theft by unlawful taking. He asked Walters if Seybert had probation violations, and Walters replied, “Yes.” Gnage then asked Walters to state the violations. Walters said a violation of Condition One of his probation was a failure to report to probation on May 11, 2016, after he had been instructed via voice mail to do so by Walters on May 10. A violation of Condition Two, was o be living at the residence of record on State Street in North Warren, when he had been staying with a friend for about one month at a different location without notifying his probation officer. Walters said Seybert violated Condition 4, requiring him to obey local, state and federal laws. Condition 3 required Seybert to not associate with individuals participating in criminal activities or with known criminal records, and he was associating with his former girlfriend, whom he knew to have a criminal record. Finally, by committing 24 counts each of retail theft and defiant trespass at WalMart, he was in violation of another condition. Seybert’s attorney, Alan Conn, asked Walters if he recalled the phone number he called on May 10 to schedule a probation appointment, and Walters testified that the defendant had changed phone numbers several times, so he wasn’t sure of the number he had called. Later in the hearing, Seybert testified that the phone he had been using at the time was a prepaid cell and had run out of minutes. Judge Hammond asked Walters if Seybert had contacted him at anytime between May 11, 2016, and his arrest date of July 29. Walters said he had not. Seybert admitted to the judge he had gone to a friends house for “a little bit,” and Hammond asked how long that was. “About a month,” Seybert replied. Hammond asked him if he had spoken with his probation officer. “I never talked to a cop until I turned myself in,” he answered. Gnage continued, “After May 30, 2014, were you at WalMart at any time?” “Yes,” Seybert said. “Did you tell your probation officer you were staying at a friend’s?” “No,” he answered. After Gnage and Conn said they had no further testimony, Hammond said, “Clearly the Commonwealth has met the burden of proof. I found the testimony of Officer Walters credible. You did not report over two months. From your own testimony, you were at a friend’s for a month.” He added that Seybert clearly knew his former girlfriend had a criminal record, in part because Seybert had participated in some of the criminal acts with her. Hammond said Seybert not only violated the rules and conditions of his parole, he also violated Judge Maureen Skerda’s sentencing order for him to have no contact with WalMart by committing 24 counts each of retail theft and defiant trespass while on probation. “You disappeared for months, with no contact with your probation officer,” he added. He then revoked Seybert’s parole and re-imposed the sentence of six months to one year in jail for theft by unlawful taking, with credit for 86 days served, and eligibility for early release and work release. Hammond added that if Seybert was paroled, he would have to make bail on the 48 new counts against him.

Behind the scenes, she dispenses copies of the self-help book “The Untethered Soul” to her contestants, trying to calm them down before live performances. On camera, she showcases an eclectic style — like an outfit covered in paper flowers — meant to counteract any last-minute jitters. “I think it makes the contestants feel safer,” says Cyrus of her colorful wardrobe. “When I turn around, people laugh and feel lighthearted. I think they get to see that side of me.” For many years, Cyrus had a different public persona. “People saw me as being wild, and literally all I do is I’m obsessed with yoga, I love hiking, and I’m reading constantly. “My life is so positive. From the outside, people think I’m partying with rappers. That was back in my prime.” It’s hard to keep a straight face when Cyrus uses that line — she’s only 23. Then again, she’s been on television since grade school. At 11, Cyrus was cast as the squeaky-clean face of Disney Channel’s “Hannah Montana,” which made her the Hayley Mills of her generation. The role brought intense tabloid scrutiny, particularly as she tried to grow up. “I had a clothing line at Walmart and got kicked out, because they said you had to choose weed or Walmart,” Cyrus says. “And you see what I did — I chose weed.” In 2013, the Miley media circus reached a tipping point at the VMAs, where she gyrated alongside a row of teddy bears. She insists that the moment was misunderstood. “That was a joke,” she says. Cyrus has taken a U-turn since then. Her new career path revolves around her foundation: Happy Hippie, dedicated to supporting at-risk LGBTQ and homeless youth. “I am only doing ‘The Voice’ because that helps Happy Hippie,” Cyrus says about engaging the show’s audience to promote her cause. Cyrus has headlined such films as: “The Last Song” and “Bolt,” but she’s ambivalent about making movies now. “I know that acting is boring,” she says. “People get paid way too much for what they are doing.” She almost turned down the Woody Allen TV series “Crisis in Six Scenes” but was eventually won over by the role — playing a 1960s activist. Over a vegan lunch in Los Angeles, Cyrus talked about what drives her, recalled how she struggled with her pansexual identity as a teenager (she’s currently dating Liam Hemsworth), and shared her thoughts on the election.

We’ve written about some truly haunting documentaries before (see here and here); here are another 10 to add to your queue. 1. CRAZY LOVE (2007) One sunny day in the Bronx, Burt Pugach met a girl. They fell in love, and soon made plans to get married. The only problem? He already had a wife. After Linda Riss broke off their affair, Pugach became obsessive. He harassed her, threw rocks at her window, and threatened that if he couldn’t have her, no one else could. He wasn’t kidding: in 1959, he sent hired men to throw lye in her eyes, permanently scarring her face and almost completely blinding her. That didn’t stop Riss from marrying Pugach after he was released from jail in 1974. Crazy Love delves into this twisted romance, seeking to answer how Riss could wed a man who had so viciously attacked her. Why it’s so creepy: Burt and Linda’s courtship is often presented as a sweet romance from a bygone era. The film mixes in Smokey Robinson tunes, pin-up photos, and Johnny Mathis footage as friends fondly reminisce about the pair’s meet-cute. This wholesome treatment only makes the real-life details more horrifying—especially since Linda, who passed away in 2013, likely viewed her marriage through this rosier, nostalgia-tinged lens. 2. JESUS CAMP (2006) Jesus Camp follows children attending a Christian summer camp in Devils Lake, North Dakota. Only the young campers at Kids on Fire don’t make friendship bracelets or tell ghost stories around the campfire; instead, they fill their days with sermons preaching Islamophobia, homophobia, and a militant call to action against anyone opposing Christian beliefs. Kids on Fire received so many outraged calls and emails after this movie was released that camp director Becky Fischer had to shut it down. She didn’t quit, though; she just rebranded. Why it’s so creepy: Watching brainwashed children recite hateful beliefs they can’t possibly understand is bad enough. But a cameo from disgraced pastor Ted Haggard will leave you feeling extra queasy. 3. MADNESS IN THE FAST LANE (2010) This BBC documentary opens on a highly disturbing image: two women, standing on the highway shoulder with police officers, suddenly make a determined dash into oncoming traffic. Swedish sisters Ursula and Sabina Eriksson wreaked havoc on the London roads in May of 2008 when they repeatedly bolted across busy highways. After cops arrived on the scene, they fought them off to continue their suicidal runs. They were finally subdued and taken to an ambulance. But when Sabina was released a day later, she stabbed a man to death. The explanation for the twins’ bizarre behavior remains murky to this day, but this documentary attempts to make some sense of it all, with the help of criminal psychiatrist Dr. Nigel Eastman. Why it’s so creepy: Those early images are terrifying, but so is the footage of Sabina in the police station after she’s been apprehended for her highway sprints. She’s chatty, friendly, almost flirty with the cops passing by. There’s no trace of the woman who just struck those same cops for trying to save her life—nor the woman who would murder a kind stranger the very next day. 4. KIDS FOR CASH (2013) At the heart of this tale of corruption, greed, and wrongful imprisonment is Mark Ciavarella. The Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania judge was convicted of fraud (along with fellow judge Michael Conahan) for sending 3000 kids to juvenile detention centers in exchange for kickbacks. What crimes were these kids accused of committing? Making fake MySpace profiles and stealing DVDs from Wal-Mart. Kids for Cash plays on real fears that will resonate with parents especially. One is that children’s lives can be irrevocably altered by a single youthful impulse. Another is that elected officials will do truly heinous things for money. But the most sobering is that you can’t completely trust the people who have sworn to judge you fairly in the eyes of the law. Why it’s so creepy: Ciavarella is a natural villain, especially since he maintained throughout the trial that he was blameless. One highly upsetting scene where the mother of a teen boy he imprisoned confronts him outside the courtroom is bound to stay with you. 5. DREAMS OF A LIFE (2011) Joyce Carol Vincent was a glamorous, ambitious woman who kept a social circle that included Stevie Wonder and Isaac Hayes. But when she died alone in her apartment in 2003, no one noticed for three years. Director Carol Morley was spurred to make a film about Vincent after learning about the discovery of her body—found decomposing in front of the television, surrounded by unopened Christmas gifts—and wanting to know more about the woman’s life. The question repeated again and again in the film is how could a person as vivacious and well-liked as Vincent end up so alone? Alternately eerie and heartbreaking, this documentary will make you wonder who would notice if you were gone. Why it’s so creepy: This isn’t some sketch of a stranger. Through interviews with Vincent’s friends and former lovers, she becomes a fully-drawn human being. This is also aided by Zawe Ashton, the actress who plays the fictionalized version of Vincent in several sequences. Once she becomes real, the sinking feeling that this could happen to anyone really takes hold. 6. TITICUT FOLLIES (1967) Thought American Horror Story: Asylum was scary? Then you won’t be able to sleep after seeing this true-life look at a Massachusetts mental institution. Frederick Wiseman’s unflinching documentary of abuse shows naked patients being mocked, force-fed, and generally treated like animals. Roger Ebert called it “one of the most despairing documentaries” he had ever seen in 1968—and he was one of the few who had even seen it at that time. The documentary was banned for 24 years over an injunction filed by the Massachusetts state government, citing concerns over the patients’ privacy. By the time it was lifted in 1991, Titicut Follies had already helped close several psychiatric wards. Why it’s so creepy: The starkness of the footage is what makes Titicut Follies so unsettling. Shot in black-and-white, this documentary features no narration and no sympathetic onscreen presence to guide you through the horrors of Bridgewater State Hospital. You’re essentially locked up with the patients, and no one is coming to help. 7. GOING CLEAR (2015) Scientology has been the butt of jokes ever since its posterboy Tom Cruise bounced off Oprah’s yellow couch. But this HBO documentary makes one thing clear: you shouldn’t be laughing at Scientology. You should be disturbed by it. Over the course of two hours, director Alex Gibney paints a picture of a cult that threatens its members, drains their bank accounts, and exiles them from their families should they dare complain. Although Scientology is secretive by nature, Gibney managed to unearth tons of clips that reveal the disturbing dynamics of the community—plus all their awful ‘90s sweaters. Why it’s so creepy: Have you ever listened to someone who escaped a cult tell his or her story? It’s really upsetting, and it happens over and over again in Going Clear. Through interviews with ex-members and archival footage, Gibney makes the specter of Scientology leader David Miscavige loom large. 8. THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE (2012) The so-called Central Park jogger case electrified New York City in 1989. After Trisha Meili was raped and beaten in the middle of her nighttime run in the park, the NYPD moved quickly to put the perpetrator behind bars. Too quickly, it turns out. Five juveniles were charged on faulty evidence and sentenced to prison. They would remain trapped behind bars until 2002, when the real culprit confessed and cleared the boys (by then, men) with his DNA match. In covering the case, The Central Park Five isn’t just interested in exposing the horrors of the judicial system. It also digs into the racism and media bias that convinced the courts a group of black and Hispanic boys had to be guilty. Why it’s so creepy: It’s a somber reminder of the precarious position minorities live in each day. In an eerie case of deja vu, Donald Trump is also involved, giving offensive statements to the press. 9. CATFISH (2010) The documentary that launched an MTV series and a fun new term for conning people online, Catfish examines an Internet flirtation gone wrong. Nev Schulman (whose brother Ariel co-directs) believes he’s chatting with a young dancer named Megan. She has a Facebook network of parents, siblings, and other friends who seemingly back up her identity. But “Megan” is actually a cover for a very different person, whom Nev unmasks in the movie’s climax. Some critics—including Morgan Spurlock—believe that Catfish was dramatized. But as anyone who’s been on social media for five seconds knows, it’s alarmingly easy to pretend you’re somebody else. Why it’s so creepy: Millions of people rely on dating apps and websites to meet their future partners. The thought that they might be talking to an avatar is horrifying. Nev drives that point home during the scenes featuring his more, uh, intimate encounters with Megan. 10. ROOM 237 (2012) Room 237 is ostensibly about The Shining, Stanley Kubick’s mega-famous horror movie. But it isn’t Jack Nicholson’s crazed grin that gives this documentary its frights. Several Shining obsessives spend their screentime detailing theories about what the movie really means—and their explanations range from reasonable to “the moon landing was fake.” (No seriously, one of them connects The Shining to that.) As their narrations go on, you can feel their minds descend into a madness not unlike Jack Torrance’s. Why it’s so creepy: You never see any of the commentators onscreen, but you can hear their voices catch as they describe the amount of time and resources they’ve wasted chasing a crazy thought. These people have an unhealthy obsession, and what starts as a farcical look at fandom grows troublesome by the end.

Similar events have been occurring all around the country since mid-August when a man was dressed as a clown in a woods in South Carolina and it was reported that he tried to lure kids with candy. Since that incident, a man in Kentucky was arrested for dressing up as a clown and hiding in the woods. In Alabama, a woman called 911 because she was scared after seeing a clown in a Wal-Mart parking lot.  A teen was chased out of a subway station by a clown in New York City. More than two dozen states have been affected by this clown epidemic. Young kids are being terrorized by what was once a person in a funny costume blowing up balloon animals at an 8-year-old’s birthday party. Having coulrophobia, or a fear of clowns, was once easily avoidable. Now, anyone who is afraid of clowns can see a clown anywhere at any time. At Penn State, hundreds of students took to the streets to create a massive clown hunt. A Connecticut school district is banning any kind of clown costumes as a “symbol of terror.” An armed clown hoax put a Massachusetts college on lockdown. Here in upstate New York, the Village of Phoenix’s police department has been asking that people do not dress as clowns for Halloween. No deaths had actually been reported until a 16-year-old boy was stabbed to death by someone wearing a clown mask in Reading, Pennsylvania, at the end of September. After seeing posts on YikYak of clowns being on campus and on a floor in Onondaga Hall, this is not funny. Wearing a clown mask and scaring people, is that really how you want to spend your free time? This clown epidemic has multiple people “clown hunting,” which involves being extremely loud and carrying around hockey sticks, golf clubs, baseball bats and anything else they can find. They are not carrying hockey sticks, golf clubs and baseball bats because they are on their way out the door to play a sport at 11 p.m. and they will not be politely asking you to join.  This “trend” needs to end as quickly as the Pokémon Go trend did. Think of all the things someone could be doing instead of hunting clowns or dressing up as the clown. Maybe completing assignments that should have been done the night before that are already late. How about making dinner and eating some really good food or even catching up on the latest season of your favorite show on Netflix. Once again, who wants to spend their free time wearing a clown mask, scaring people and risking students attacking you with hockey sticks? This is unsafe. This is not funny. For peope with phobias, this is scary. Stop it. It is not funny anymore and people are starting to get hurt. Please, make a nice dinner, do your homework, watch more Netflix and go to McDonalds.

"It’s just trying to please too many people." On Wednesday, Pandora unveiled its newly redesigned logo. In a blog post on the site announcing the change, Tony Calzaretta, VP Creative Services, wrote, "We’ve been with you for years. We’ve adapted to your musical tastes, served up your favorites, and surprised you with unexpected discoveries." So, the post continued, in celebration of the "milestone" that is Pandora Plus -- the new subscription-based option with no ads, unlimited skips and offline listening -- "we’re unveiling a new brand to enhance your Pandora experience and help bring your music to life." Notwithstanding the substantial improvements in the service itself, how does that new logo stack up? Well, graphic design experts who spoke with Billboard all echoed similar sentiments: It doesn't really do much to propel the streaming radio service forward. Armin Vit, editor of the corporate and brand identity blog Brand New and principal of graphic design firm Under Consideration, penned a review of the new logos, in which he described both the wordmark and monogram as simple and "easy to embrace," if a bit bland and generic. "It’s not offensive, it’s easy to reproduce, it looks good because it’s so simple and clean, so it’s kind of like a recurring trap," Vit tells Billboard. "It's not a bad trap, it’s just something clients fall into because it looks so effortless." He added that it works well on the end of the designers, too, in that it's both easy to create and easy to sell to a client, as there is a certain comfort that comes with a simple design solution, and he says such logos can often be sold as "a good pair of jeans" because they go well with anything. John Caserta, department head of graphic design at Rhode Island School of Design, agrees. "In the landscape of music brands, it just doesn’t seem particularly innovative," he says. He adds the redesign isn't particularly in line with the extent of the improvements in the service "because it certainly doesn’t have the weight of some massive overhaul." Both the new Pandora Plus platform and the new logo arrive less than 12 months after Spotify revealed its own redesign back in summer 2015, which Caserta says isn't uncommon. He says if you look through hundreds of company logos, there will be noticeable trends in certain fields, using the example that once Kmart redesigned, Walmart followed suit 12 months later. "You’ll realize, 'OK, somebody clearly reacted to somebody else,'" he says. Within the music industry in particular, he says, there's so much competition surrounding software, licensing, exclusives and price points that the logo is far from the biggest factor. However, it should still encapsulate and represent a unified and unique vision -- which is where Pandora's redesigned logo falls short. Both Caserta and Vit point to the visual accompaniment for the new P monogram -- a 30-second clip of flashing colors and concert footage set to electronic beats -- as being reminiscent of the early MTV logo, in the sense that its ever-changing and easily adaptable. Pandora claims the variations in which the P can exist "embraces the dynamic range of sound and color, visualizing the energy and emotion that artists pour into the creation of music, and that we feel as listeners." The Pandora blog post also placed a heavy burden on the new logo's shoulders, stating it will serve as a "portal into the unique and diverse range of music you love" -- a goal Vit says is too wide-reaching. "This P can be everything for everyone and it can represent any kind of music genre," he says. "So it’s an easy way of adding visual diversity so that anyone can identify with it and feel that their tastes are being catered to in one way or another." However, he adds, it doesn't make a bold statement. "I think that that’s where this falls short: It’s just trying to please too many people without really having a unique statement." This is most likely why the space in the P is filled in, he says, which created "one big shape" and allows for more creative freedom since it can be filled in and/or laid over various backgrounds. Such endless adaptability proves to be too much here, though, which is why Vit says Spotify's redesign was generally more successful, since it built a consistent visual language, while Pandora's redesign is more of a free-for-all. "This is the right time and the right amount of change for Pandora," says Sam Becker, executive creative director, New York, for design agency Brand Union. "Unfortunately, the whole thing feels skin-deep."   FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Comments Magazine Customer Service Subscribe Buy this issue Billboard biz The online extension of Billboard Magazine, billboard.biz is the essential online destination for the music business.
