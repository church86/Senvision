HILO, Hawaii – Safety concerns and potential construction violations at the Hilo Walmart were brought to the attention of the Hawaii County Council last week. The discussion took place September 7 during the meeting of the Committee on Public Works and Parks and Recreation, when Hilo councilman Aaron Chung shared recent complaints received by his office. The complaints came from the Pacific Resource Partnership, which represents the Hawaii Regional Council of Carpenters and more than 240 contractors. According to Chris Delaney of PRP, Walmart is doing an unpermitted renovation. He also accused Walmart of hiring unlicensed subcontractors and committing OSHA violations. Part of the problem seemed to be confusion over Hawaiian Homelands regulation. “We had a tenant that was operating under the mistaken belief that they did not have to get a permit, because the original person that built the building – DHHL – had taken themselves out of county regulation,” said Brandon Gonzalez, deputy public works director. Public Works said Walmart has submitted its plans for review in order to get the proper building permit. Walmart faces a penalty for its after-the-fact permit application.

He told KNXV that he has a leg injury, which is why he decided to use a motorized shopping scooter. Avalos decided to investigate the scooter, and that’s when he saw the tiny brown bugs on the seat. He and his girlfriend, Lupita Cruz, went to look for another scooter to use and found more bed bugs. “I got out of the chair, turned around and the whole chair was infested with bed bugs,” he said. Pest expert and owner of The Works Pest Control Ian Campbell told KNXV that the bugs probably appeared on the scooters after someone who has an infestation at home came into Walmart and that anyone who sat on the scooters could have brought the pests back to their home. “That person goes home and sits on their couch and instantly the bed bug tries to hide,” Campbell said. “That bed bug is going to feed on [that person] and once they feed they start laying eggs.” Walmart released a statement regarding the incident. “The carts have been pulled from public use, and we’re awaiting a team to arrive at the store for testing,” Walmart’s senior manager of corporate communications Charles Crowson  said in the statement. If you’re worried about taking bed bugs home and ending up with an infestation in your house, you can take precautions. “All the clothes you’re wearing, put them in the dryer on high heat for about an hour and a half or so,” Campbell advises.

He vowed that his company and other supporters would continue their efforts to promote the alternative plans in other states. (Dylan Hollingsworth for ProPublica) This story was co-published with NPR. A national campaign to rewrite state laws and allow businesses to decide how to care for their injured workers suffered a significant setback Tuesday when the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled that Oklahoma’s version of the law is unconstitutional. The 2013 legislation gave Oklahoma employers the ability to “opt out” of the state workers’ compensation system and write their own plans, setting the terms for what injuries were covered, which doctors workers could see, how workers were compensated and how disputes were handled. The statute was backed by the oil and gas industry and retailer Hobby Lobby. Buoyed by the success in Oklahoma, proponents took the idea nationwide as a coalition led by Walmart, Lowe’s and several of the largest retail, trucking and health care companies sought to pass similar laws across the country. Bills and draft proposals have been floated in Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Illinois. Last year, an investigation by ProPublica and NPR found that the plans typically had lower benefits and more restrictions than workers’ comp. The story was part of a series on how states have been dismantling workers’ comp, which was designed a century ago to protect businesses from lawsuits while providing medical care and lost wages to workers who had been hurt on the job. Tuesday’s decision is the latest in a series of state Supreme Court rulings that have struck down several business-driven workers’ comp laws featured in the ProPublica and NPR investigation. The Florida Supreme Court struck down laws that placed strict caps on attorney fees and limited workers to two years of temporary disability pay regardless of whether they were able to return to work. Two-year caps have also been passed in California, North Dakota, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Texas. In addition, the top Oklahoma court in April overturned a provision that drastically cut compensation for workers who suffered permanently disabling injuries. Florida, New York and Tennessee have also significantly reduced benefits for such injuries in the past 13 years, but those provisions are still in place. Inside Corporate America’s Campaign to Ditch Workers’ Comp One Texas lawyer is helping companies opt out of workers’ compensation and write their own rules. What does it mean for injured workers? Read the story. The stories also prompted two groups — one of academics and one of workers’ comp regulators — to schedule separate forums later this month to discuss the various changes that have occurred and ways to improve workers’ comp. Oklahoma’s ruling leaves Texas as the only state that lets employers opt out of workers’ comp insurance. Bob Burke, a longtime workers’ comp attorney who has filed several successful challenges to Oklahoma’s new law, called opt out “the biggest attack on the American worker” since he started practicing law. Had the Supreme Court not acted, the Oklahoma opt-out law “would have deprived injured workers out of necessary surgeries and weekly benefits,” he said in an email. “Opt out also would have allowed companies to shift the cost of paying for work-related injuries to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.” Bill Minick, a Dallas lawyer whose company PartnerSource wrote most of the Oklahoma opt-out plans and about half of those in Texas, said in a statement that the ruling was specific to “Oklahoma’s unique constitution.” He vowed that his company and other supporters would continue their efforts to promote the alternative plans in other states. “We believe it’s critical to provide better care and benefits for injured workers, decrease the number of disputed claims and significantly decrease insurance premiums and claim costs for all employers,” he said. The Oklahoma case involved an employee at Dillard’s department store who injured her neck and shoulder while lifting shoeboxes in 2014. Dillard’s, which had opted out of workers’ comp and created its own benefit plan, initially paid for her medical care. But the company later denied her claims, insisting that any further damage and surgeries she might need were due to a preexisting degenerative condition and not her injury at work. In a 7–2 ruling, the justices found that such opt-out plans were unconstitutional because they treated one group of injured workers differently from all other injured workers in the state. In a concurring opinion, Justices Noma Gurich and Tom Colbert noted that while most Oklahoma workers have 30 days to report an injury and can request a hearing before a judge, Dillard’s employees had to report injuries by the end of the workday and could only appeal in writing to a committee made up of people picked by the company. The court sent the case back to the state’s workers’ comp commission to determine whether the injury was work-related and what benefits, if any, the woman should receive. Like this story?

News Peninsula stores fight for grocery dollars Hampton Roads grocery store market share rankings TidewaterBiz.com reports grocery rankings in our local area. TidewaterBiz.com reports grocery rankings in our local area. Tara BozickContact Reportertbozick@dailypress.com Who are the top grocers in Hampton Roads? Peninsula grocers are adapting to give customers what they expect — healthy, quality food at affordable prices — as Wal-Mart, Kroger and Whole Foods continue to grab more market share in the region. Of the total Hampton Roads market share, Food Lion remains the dominant grocer with Wal-Mart at No. 2 and Farm Fresh at No. 3, according to trade publication Food World's annual market study report. On a more local level, Food Lion is the favorite for Newport News, Hampton, Isle of Wight, Smithfield and Mathews while shoppers in James City and Williamsburg prefer Farm Fresh, according to the report. Wal-Mart dominates in Gloucester while the big-box retailer barely beats out Food Lion in York County. Food Lion remains the dominant grocer in Hampton Roads, according to trade publication Food World's annual market study report. Check out the full list. Regionwide, Food Lion dominates because it has the most stores with 78 to garner 17.8 percent of total market share, according to the report. Farm Fresh took a dip from 13.9 percent to 12.9 percent of total market share from 2015 to 2016. Wal-Mart, including its smaller Neighborhood Markets, had a slight increase in total market share from 14.8 percent to 14.9 percent from year to year. Other alternative grocers, including 7-Eleven, Wawa, Walgreens and Sam's Club, also gained ground with alternatives now representing 51.6 percent of the market, up from 51.2 percent in 2015. Military commissaries, which represent 10 percent of the Newport News and Hampton market share, saw a total regional market share dip from 4.9 percent in 2015 to 4.4 percent this year, according to the Food World report. Kroger's addition of Marketplace stores in Hampton Roads contributed to its increase in total market share from 4.76 percent to 4.84 percent, according to the Food World report.

Electric cars account for less than 1% of U.S. new car sales right now, but that number will most likely increase in the future. Hampton Roads is already a highly competitive market where price remains the primary driver with strong low-price influence from Wal-Mart and the commissaries, according to the report. And it's only going to get more competitive as discount retailers Aldi and Lidl plan to enter the market and as Kroger plans more stores on the Peninsula — in Denbigh and in the redevelopment of Riverdale Plaza in Hampton. Keep your eye on Food Lion's sustainability in Hampton Roads when German discount grocer Lidl starts entering the market in 2018 with nine stores planned so far in the region, including two in Newport News and one in Hampton, Food World Publisher Jeff Metzger said. The millennial generation, or the 18-34 age group, is driving a lot of change toward nutrition and wellness as well as convenience, Metzger said. That's why you see grocers adapting with better marketed organic and natural food sections and a better selection of prepared food or ready-to-cook items. Over the years, Hampton Roads' changing demographics has led to households with more disposable income, demanding higher end stores and selection, Metzger said. Whole Foods is the case in point in Newport News, where Mid-Atlantic favorite Wegmans also had its eye. Grocers are also adding improved private-label products, which could appeal to those who aren't as brand loyal, Metzger said. What grocery store chain is the Peninsula still missing? Do you want to see a Wegman's? A Publix? Here's a partial look at missing supermarkets. For instance, Food Lion recently took its premium-tier Taste of Inspirations deli line companywide, said Wanda Marshburn, Food Lion director of operations for 25 stores in the Newport News-Hampton region. Salisbury, N.C.-based Food Lion, which is part of the Ahold Delhaize group, continues to invest to keep low prices on staple items and has been enhancing stores to showcase its fresh produce and natural and organic items, Marshburn said. Food Lion makes buying natural or premium products more affordable with its own brands, including its own wine, she added. Food Lion also remains strong because of its convenient neighborhood locations and dedicated employees, Marshburn said. Farm Fresh has been remodeling stores on the Peninsula to modernize the shopping experience, said Dave Huettl, vice president of sales and merchandising. From 2014 to the end of 2016, Farm Fresh will have remodeled 18 of its 41 stores in Hampton Roads, including seven of 12 Peninsula stores. Much of those renovations have focused on highlighting its fresh products in addition to revamping the deli, bakery and seafood departments, Huettl said. (Judith Lowery) Throughout the store, Farm Fresh is allocating more space to capture customer trends for healthier options, including organic and gluten-free items, and its chef-to-go items to make it easier for folks who want to cook gourmet-style meals at home, Huettl said. The company is also adding more items to the Wild Harvest line. "We try to give you a convenient meal solution regardless of the size of your family," Huettl said. Farm Fresh finds more folks want healthier meal options and transparency in labeling, he said. Still, Virginia Beach-based Farm Fresh, a subsidiary of Minnesota's SuperValu, might appeal to millennials who are focused on the local community. "Being in the area, we're always trying to highlight who's local, what's local in our weekly ads in the store," Huettl said. While Cincinnati-based The Kroger Co. and its Village Square at Kiln Creek shopping center store compete well on price, the biggest change the company has seen during the past five years has been the customer emphasis on convenience, spokeswoman Noelle Motley said in an email. That's why the company is rolling out its ClickList online ordering service at stores in South Hampton Roads this year. Kroger now operates 10 stores in the region, including four Marketplace stores that sell home decor, bed and bath items and small appliances. The new Marketplaces and providing items customers ask for, such as natural and organic foods, local produce and craft products, have helped Kroger's regional uptick in sales, Motley said. Millennials also like the digital coupon savings and prepared foods. Harris Teeter has been able benefit from its January 2014 merger with The Kroger Co. to pass savings on to shoppers with lower prices on thousands of products, said spokeswoman Lea Ramsey. Harris Teeter's market share in Hampton Roads grew from 6.08 percent to 6.15 percent, according to Food World. The grocer also prides itself on its quality products, extensive selection, clean stores, friendly staff and promotions. The Fresh Market, which saw its regional market share increase from 1.06 percent to 1.29 percent, had already been providing shoppers easy grab-and-go options for preparing a home-cooked meal, said spokeswoman Stephanie Lowder. The "Little Big Meal" program changes meals each week. Food World's market analysis is based on information collected from April 1, 2015, through March 31, 2016.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Kate Taylor Sep 13th 2016 2:41PM Walmart just patented a system based on mini-robots that can control shopping carts, as well as complete a long list of duties once reserved for human employees. Last week, Walmart was granted a patent for a new system that allows shopping carts to drive themselves, untouched by customers and employees. However, the system goes far beyond self-driving carts, with details on automated devices that can do much of the work a human employees would do. According to the patent, "motorized transport units" are tools that attach to shopping carts, allowing the carts to drive freely around the store, be summoned to customers, and move safely into docks instead of clogging up parking lots. The system uses a combination of sensors, video cameras, a wireless network, and a central computer. Thomson Reuters But, Walmart's plans are bigger than cleaning up carts more efficiently. These motorized units can also potentially move containers; scan, retrieve, and deliver products; check inventory; retrieve trash; and even connect with customers. And, the patent says that Walmart is not limiting what else the motorized units can be configured to do. While the patent describes the motorized unit's role as enhancing a shopping experience and assisting customers or employees, the new tech could be bad news for Walmart employees.

More than 200 violent crimes have been committed so far this year at Walmart locations across the US, with Bloomberg arguing that the rise in crime is linked to the retailer understaffing stores. Cost-cutting policies that started in the early 2000s resulted in a drop in store quality, while the loss of greeters and the rise of self-checkout scanners made shoplifting and other illegal activities easier to engage in without employees noticing. The patent's authors argue that the new, tech-heavy system could improve customers' in-store experience and solve problems that Walmart employees cannot. Thomson Reuters "In a modern retail store environment, there is a need to improve the customer experience and/or convenience for the customer," reads the patent's background section, which notes issues including insufficient employees in peak hours, under-trained workers due to high-turnover rate, messy aisles, and theft. "All of these issues can result in low customer satisfaction or reduced convenience to the customer," the patent continues. "With increasing competition from non-traditional shopping mechanisms, such as online shopping provided by e-commerce merchants and alternative store formats, it can be important for 'brick and mortar' retailers to focus on improving the overall customer experience and/or convenience." Further, the benefits of a more-fully automated store are particularly appealing for retailers as labor costs rise, according to analysts. While Walmart CEO Doug McMillon announced $2.7 billion in spending on wages and training last year, labor activists argue that the retailer still underpays employees and continue to call for higher pay. Walmart did not respond to Business Insider's request to comment, and has not provided any information regarding if or when the new system would roll out in stores. With robots that can drive shopping carts and preform a wide array of other employee duties, Walmart could cut the number of employees on payroll while also improving customer experience. Automation is already taking over the fast-food industry — and it looks like the budget retail business might be next. NOW WATCH: We tested Walmart's ice-cream sandwiches, which supposedly don't melt, and were mystified by the results 9 ways to save money at Walmart: 10 PHOTOS 9 secret ways to save money at Walmart See Gallery 9 secret ways to save money at Walmart 1. Take Advantage of Walmart's Price Matching Policy  Even if Walmart isn’t offering the lowest price on a given item, you can take advantage of the store’s price match policy to secure a better deal. Walmart will match any advertised price from stores in your area, said Paul Ivanovsky, creator of IHeartTheMart.com, a blog dedicated to saving money at Walmart. To qualify, the items in question must be identical and in stock at the other retailer. According to Ivanovsky, the price matching policy is a great way to save money on items such as fruit, meat and paper products. Additionally, Walmart will match many online competitors’ prices for home goods and other non-food items. While restrictions exist, the retail giant will generally match prices for goods from Amazon.com, BestBuy.com, Target.com and TigerDirect.com, among other stores.

Get Online Prices in the Store Before you make a purchase in one of its stores, see if Walmart is offering a better price online, as the company will match Walmart.com prices for in-store purchases. Bethany Halford, co-creator of the Whoa, Wait. Walmart? blog that features great finds at Walmart, said she frequently finds items that have been marked down online but not in the stores. To get the better price, she pulls the item up on her phone and shows it to the cashier when she checks out. Recently, Halford saved a couple dollars when she found a pair of slippers selling for $12.88 in the store and about $10 online.

Use the Savings Catcher App If you forgot to check other stores’ prices before shopping at Walmart, you still can take advantage of the retailer’s price match policy after the fact by using the Savings Catcher app. After scanning your receipt with the app, you can compare the prices you paid with local competitors’ advertised rates, Ivanovsky said. If an item you bought is cheaper elsewhere, you will be credited the difference in the form of Savings Catcher Rewards Dollars, which can be redeemed for a Walmart gift card or Walmart Buck$ to be added to a Bluebird by American Express Card prepaid debit card. “Even if you don’t think you bought something that can be matched, you might be surprised at what the Savings Catcher finds for you,” said Dian Farmer of GroceryShopForFree.com. Photo credit: iStock.com/LDProd 4. Get Free Shipping From Walmart.com Shipping costs can quickly negate the savings you might accumulate by shopping online. However, there are two ways you can get free shipping from Walmart.com. If you spend $50 or more online, Walmart will ship your purchases for free, Halford said. While there’s a flat $4.97 shipping fee for orders less than $50, shoppers can get around that fee by having online purchases shipped to their local stores, said Amanda Jerkins, the other co-creator of Whoa, Wait. Walmart? It’s important to note that perishable products, hazardous materials and items weighing more than 350 pounds aren’t eligible for free store pickup. With many other items, though, you can pick them up the same day you order them online. Photo credit: chrisdorney/Shutterstock.com 5. Comb Through the Clearance Racks If you rush through your Walmart trips, you might miss out on some of the retailer’s best clearance deals. Typically, deeply discounted items are placed in an aisle near the toy or lawn and garden department, Halford said. When she and Jerkins comb through the clearance racks, they often find that items they were coveting at full price are now on sale for much less. For example, Jerkins said she recently found a floor lamp she wanted that was marked down from $45 to $20 in the clearance section. She also recommends checking the end caps on aisles throughout the store for heavily discounted items. Photo credit: Kzenon/Shutterstock.com 6. Shop Early in the Morning for Grocery Deals If your local Walmart has a grocery department, you can save money by timing your food shopping trips right. Farmer recommends shopping early in the morning to score discounts on one of the priciest food items on your list — meat. “Normally, by 8 a.m., the meat department has discounted their meat, and you can grab some great deals,” she said. Photo credit: iStock.com/Steve Debenport 7. Tap Into Seasonal Savings Walmart is known for offering great Black Friday sales. In fact, DealNews.com found that it was among the top five retailers with the best deals on Black Friday and the entire week of Thanksgiving. However, there are other times of the year when retailers offers savings, as well. In particular, July has become a season for merchants to promote Black Friday-like deals, said Slickdeals.net consumer expert Regina Conway. In July of 2015, Walmart hosted a big sale to rival Amazon’s one-day sale for its Prime members, who pay a $99 annual fee for free two-day shipping and other benefits. Amazon has already announced plans to hold the event again, and Conway anticipates that Walmart will do the same. As an added bonus, Walmart doesn’t require any sort of membership fee to take advantage of its deals. Photo credit: txking/Shutterstock.com 8. Get $1 Deals Some of the items you can find at a dollar store can also be purchased at Walmart for $1 or less — and you don’t even have to ask for price matching. For example, Walmart sells personal grooming products such as deodorant and shampoo for about $1. You also can find greeting cards and gift bags for $1, although the selection is smaller than what you’d see at a traditional dollar store. Ivanovsky keeps a running list on IHeartTheMart.com of Walmart’s current dollar deals. Photo credit: Khomkrit Phonsai/Shutterstock.com 9. Get Free Grocery Pickup Walmart has rolled out a new service in some cities that doesn’t cost a dime to use and can save shoppers a lot of valuable time: grocery pickup. Customers in Atlanta, Nashville, Colorado Springs, Tucson, Charlotte, Fayetteville, Salt Lake City and Ogden can now order their groceries online and then pick them up at select stores in their areas. You can even select a time for your pickup, and an associate will load the groceries into your car. Follow the above tips on your next Walmart trip, and you will likely be smiling as brightly as the retailer’s trademark logo.

 Target's biggest problem isn't a customer boycott Hayley Peterson Sep. 13, 2016, 2:29 PM 45,327 facebook linkedin twitter email print Target is losing customers to Walmart and Amazon. Associated Press Target is losing customers to Walmart and Amazon, according to new research. The retailer recently revealed that shopper traffic is declining for the first time in years. The decline immediately followed the start of a boycott against Target for its policy welcoming transgender customers to use any bathroom or fitting room that matches their gender identity. But Cowen & Co. analysts say the real reason shoppers are abandoning Target is because they can find better prices and more convenience elsewhere. According to the analysts, Target is losing the business of shoppers who visited the retailer for "fill-in" trips — or quick stops to get a small amount of items between larger "stock-up" trips. Shoppers are cutting down on these "fill-in" trips to Target because they are finding cheaper prices at Walmart and more convenience with Amazon Prime, according to data compiled by Cowen & Co. "Amazon is seeing explosive growth in several categories most notably grocery and consumables, which accounts for 45-50% of Target's business and are likely the categories feeling pressure from the 'fill-in' trip dynamics," the analysts wrote in a research note published Monday. "In our view, Walmart can use its scale to compete on price to regain or maintain market share vs. Amazon... but Target cannot compete as easily." Joe Raedle / Getty Target's same-store transactions, which is how traffic is measured, fell 2.2% in the second quarter. Overall, sales fell 7.2% to $16.2 billion. "In the second quarter, our No. 1 challenge was traffic, which affected sales in all of our merchandise categories," Target CEO Brian Cornell said last week on a call with analysts. Target is planning to overhaul its grocery department to better compete with its rivals, but analysts say the changes will take too long to accomplish. "The food section is facing increasing competition from Walmart's price investments as well as added convenience features at some competitors, such as online grocery pickup and expanded service offerings." Walmart, Kroger, Harris Teeter, Giant Food, and other chains have started offering online grocery pickup, meaning customers can order their groceries online and pick them up at a nearby store. Analysts said Target will have to drop prices in its grocery department to stop losing customers to Walmart.

Pitting the two successful national retailers against each other as stock investments. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos (TMFSigma) Sep 13, 2016 at 2:18PM Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW) have two of the most stable retailing businesses in the stock market. In fact, both companies have raised their dividend payout for over 20 consecutive years. Wal-Mart's chief grocery rival, Kroger (NYSE:KR), can't claim the same stellar track record. Neither can Lowe's main competition, Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Today, I'm taking a closer look at these two dividend aristocrats to see which one would make a better buy for investors right now. Here are a few key statistics to get us started: Metric Wal-Mart Lowe's Market cap $217 billion $62.7 billion Sales growth 1% 5% Gross profit margin 25% 35% Dividend yield 2.8% 1.9% Price to sales 0.5 1 Forward price to earnings 16 18 Sales growth is for the past complete fiscal year and excludes fuel sales and exchange rate changes. Data sources: Company financial filings and S&P Global Market Intelligence. Operating wins: Wal-Mart Wal-Mart's operating trends are improving with respect to both its past stumbles and industry rivals. The retailing titan just posted its sixth consecutive quarter of positive comparable-store sales. Comps improved by 1.4% last quarter, which bested Target's (NYSE:TGT) 1% decline and marked an acceleration over the prior quarter's 0.8% boost. The company even managed to fight to a near draw against Kroger, which has been poaching away market share from Wal-Mart's grocery business for over a decade. Image source: Wal-Mart.  Lowe's, meanwhile, is enjoying higher absolute sales gains but is also struggling against the competition. The home improvement retailer's latest 2% comps figure was far from the 5% that Home Depot managed. At the same time, Lowe's continues to lag its bigger rival in the key metrics of profitability and cash flow. Overall then, Wal-Mart wins this round since it is executing better against peers. Cash Returns: Wal-Mart Income investors will find more reasons to prefer Wal-Mart over Lowe's today. Not only do shares come with a higher dividend yield (2.8% vs. 1.9%), but the retailing giant has demonstrated a stronger commitment to sending cash back to its shareholders. Wal-Mart spent over $6 billion on dividends last year, compared to $4 billion on stock repurchases. Lowe's, in contrast, dedicated the vast majority of its cash returns to stock buybacks. Wal-Mart also delivers a higher percentage of earnings to investors as dividends. While Lowe's aims to return just 35% of profits each year, Wal-Mart's payout ratio is climbing toward 50%. WMT PS Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts. Round two goes to the king of retail. Growth outlook: Lowe's A bright outlook for their industry has Lowe's executives feeling confident right now. After all, the home improvement market has strong fundamentals, including housing formation and home prices, that point to years of continued above-average growth. Image source: Getty Images. Lowe's executives frequently cite that "favorable macroeconomic backdrop" as a key reason that customer traffic keeps trending higher. Home Depot's management agrees, and the CEO recently told investors, "We continue to see positive signs in the housing data which we believe serve as a tailwind for our business." Wal-Mart, in contrast, is fighting to post even nominal growth in a sluggish industry that executives of Target and other retailers have called "challenging." That weakness is especially true on the grocery side of the business, where price deflation is tripping up most market participants. Kroger, for example, just posted its worst expansion pace in years and projected soft growth for the rest of the 2016 and into 2017. Give this round to Lowe's. Why Lowe's wins The stock valuations of these two retailers appear to reflect their different growth and profit profiles, as Lowe's is more expensive on both a price-to-sales and price-to-earnings basis. Still, that's a justifiable premium, in my view, given the retailer's faster, more profitable growth. There's clearly room for more gains, too, given how quickly Home Depot is expanding right now. Lowe's key challenge will be to close the gap with its key rival, which is an admittedly tough feat. Lowe's might even be preferable over Wal-Mart for income investors. Yes, its payout is lower right now. However, that is understandable, given that it needs cash for major growth initiatives like boosting its store base. And ultimately, steady housing market gains could help produce faster dividend growth over the coming decade. Demitrios Kalogeropoulos owns shares of Home Depot.

 Walmart is patenting technology that could have terrifying implications for workers Kate Taylor Sep. 13, 2016, 1:38 PM 9,354 facebook linkedin twitter email print Thomson Reuters Walmart just patented a system based on mini-robots that can control shopping carts, as well as complete a long list of duties once reserved for human employees.  Last week, Walmart was granted a patent for a new system that allows shopping carts to drive themselves, untouched by customers and employees. However, the system goes far beyond self-driving carts, with details on automated devices that can do much of the work a human employees would do.  According to the patent, "motorized transport units" are tools that attach to shopping carts, allowing the carts to drive freely around the store, be summoned to customers, and move safely into docks instead of clogging up parking lots. The system uses a combination of sensors, video cameras, a wireless network, and a central computer.  Shopping carts with the motorized transport units attached at the bottom. US Patent and Trademark Office But, Walmart's plans are bigger than cleaning up carts more efficiently. These motorized units can also potentially move containers; scan, retrieve, and deliver products; check inventory; retrieve trash; and even connect with customers. And, the patent says that Walmart is not limiting what else the motorized units can be configured to do.  "Walmart was able to revolutionize retail using technology to better serve customers," Walmart spokesperson Lorenzo Lopez told Business Insider. "And as the retail landscape continues to evolve, we want to be able to serve customers when and how they want to shop. That means testing new and innovative ways to serve the customer, which we’ve done through different initiatives like our grocery pickup service." While the patent describes the motorized unit's role as enhancing a shopping experience and assisting customers or employees, the new tech could be bad news for Walmart employees.  Walmart has come under fire for a number of issues with staffing and employees in recent months.  More than 200 violent crimes have been committed so far this year at Walmart locations across the US, with Bloomberg arguing that the rise in crime is linked to the retailer understaffing stores. Cost-cutting policies that started in the early 2000s resulted in a drop in store quality, while the loss of greeters and the rise of self-checkout scanners made shoplifting and other illegal activities easier to engage in without employees noticing. The patent's authors argue that the new, tech-heavy system could improve customers' in-store experience and solve problems that Walmart employees cannot.  Joe Raedle/Getty Images "In a modern retail store environment, there is a need to improve the customer experience and/or convenience for the customer," reads the patent's background section, which notes issues including insufficient employees in peak hours, under-trained workers due to high-turnover rate, messy aisles, and theft. "All of these issues can result in low customer satisfaction or reduced convenience to the customer," the patent continues. "With increasing competition from non-traditional shopping mechanisms, such as online shopping provided by e-commerce merchants and alternative store formats, it can be important for 'brick and mortar' retailers to focus on improving the overall customer experience and/or convenience." Further, the benefits of a more-fully automated store are particularly appealing for retailers as labor costs rise, according to analysts.  While Walmart CEO Doug McMillon announced $2.7 billion in spending on wages and training last year, labor activists argue that the retailer still underpays employees and continue to call for higher pay. "While it's too early to determine how we would even potentially use this technology, our goal always is to find ways to help simplify processes to help our associates better serve our customers as they will continue to play a critical role in the success of our business," Lopez told Business Insider. Walmart has not provided any specific information regarding if or when the new system would roll out in stores.  With robots that can drive shopping carts and preform a wide array of other employee duties, Walmart could cut the number of employees on payroll while also improving customer experience. Automation is already taking over the fast-food industry — and it looks like the budget retail business might be next.  Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.

Wal-Mart's robotic shopping carts will help you buy even more stuff Money 9/13/2016 Kaitlin Mulhere Walmart shoppers may soon be able to hail a self-driving shopping cart much like they’d hail a taxi with their smartphone. The mega-retailer has filed a patent for a cart that has a motor and video cameras, describing a cart that will drive itself to customers and even help them track down items in the store. CNN Money reports that the patent filing also says the system will be able to identify unattended carts in the parking lot and return them to a docking station, potentially saving you the headache of hunting down a prime parking spot only to find that some careless shopper left their cart in the middle of it. (Or if you’re more of a glass half-empty person, this further demonstrates all the ways robots will take our jobs—by eliminating the need for an employee to collect carts in the parking lot.) Walmart’s confirms what onlookers have suspected since June, when Five Elements Robotics announced at the Bloomberg Technology Conference that it was working with Walmart to design robotic shopping carts that would help shoppers find items on their list and automatically drive through the store and parking lot. Bloomberg reported described it as an opportunity for “brick-and-mortar stores look for innovative ways to match the convenience of Amazon.com Inc.” Walmart hasn’t commented on its robotic scheme, but this isn’t the only way the retailer is experimenting with technology. The company has implemented technology for customers inside stores to scan and purchase items on their mobile phone to avoid the check out line. Last year, Walmart also announced it wanted to use drones for delivery and warehouse operations, in much the same way as has started using robots and drones. ]]> Go to MSN Home More in Money 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money What Trump's win could mean for older Americans CBS News 30 things you should never buy without a coupon GOBankingRates 6 brand mascots that actually existed in real life Business Insider 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney Up Next 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from Money Can Trump Make Coal Great Again?

On Monday analysts at Cowen & Co. lifted their recommendation on WMT stock to “outperform” (buy, essentially) from “market perform” (neutral), citing a number of sustainable factors. According to Cowen’s own proprietary data, higher wages and better training are making a dent. Employees more helpful and the stores look better. Strength in critical retail metrics in the most recent quarter further burnish the shine on Walmart stock. 10 Growth Stocks That Will Outrun Google It also doesn’t hurt that its biggest rival has made some missteps. From Cowen’s note to clients: “We’re confident WMT’s positive US traffic (7 straight quarters) should continue over the next 2 years as WMT makes more aggressive price investments and makes further improvements in the customer experience. WMT’s impressive 2Q results of US comps of +1.6% driven by traffic of +1.2% demonstrated that the retailer is taking share at the expense of TGT, dollar stores, and grocers. The investments in wages/training from the last 2 years have elevated the store experience, as highlighted by customer satisfaction scores for the total shopping experience (76% of respondents) and customer service (63% of respondents) at 2-year high’s in our proprietary consumer survey.” Is WMT on a Retail Roll? Importantly, the story doesn’t end there. Hewing to its “always low prices” ethos, price rollbacks in the grocery category are helping to make WMT more popular with supermarket shoppers. Cowen also takes pains to remind investors that WMT is only a third of the way finished with its two-year program to make stores more desirable places for consumers. It’s a compelling argument, but one part is a little harder to swallow. Walmart is making effort to get e-commerce growing but progress has been painfully slow. Part of the bear argument against Walmart stock is, of course, the existence of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The acquisition of Jet — an e-commerce site that skews younger and more urban — is intended to help WMT’s demographics. Too bad corporate efforts at cool never seem to work. The key point on Walmart is that it is successfully addressing the things that were bringing the company — and WMT stock — down. Shabby stores or messily stocked shelves are a huge turnoff for shoppers. Just ask anyone who did back-to-school shopping at Sears Holdings Corporation (NASDAQ:SHLD) this year. Shares are outperforming the S&P 500 by a wide margin so far in 2016. However, they’ve recently plateaued. Part of the sluggishness can probably be blamed on September being the worst month for market performance. That doesn’t mean you can dismiss the doubters. Cowen’s more optimistic view is in the minority on Wall Street. Of the 27 analysts covering the stock, five have it at buy, three call it a sell and 19 say it’s a hold, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. Cowen’s target price of $83 — up from $76 — is also on the rosy side. Starbucks Corporation: Can SBUX Stock Escape This Bad Brew? Analysts’ average price target comes to $73 and change in the next year or so. The stock is currently trading between $71 and $72. Bottom Line By Cowen’s reckoning, the market is under-appreciating the effects of Walmart’s rejuvenation efforts and underestimating how much more progress is to come. The market is less sure, but recent strength in all the right areas suggests WMT stock will reap more upside for its efforts. As of this writing, Dan Burrows did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

An analyst shifts gears on the two leading discounters. Rick Munarriz (TMFBreakerRick) Sep 13, 2016 at 9:07AM Even Target's autumn home decor collection seems to know which way the stock's been heading lately. Image source: Target. We're more than two months away from the holiday shopping season, but at least one Wall Street pro is making changes to his wish list. Cowen analyst Oliver Chen is reshuffling his ratings on the country's two leading discount department store chains. He's lowering his rating on Target (NYSE:TGT) from outperform to market perform. At the same time he's boosting his call on Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) from market perform to outperform. Switcheroos don't happen often. Analysts often sour or get bullish on entire industries, but that's not the case here. Chen feels that Target's losing market share, in part, to Wal-Mart.  Target has posted year-over-year declines for three consecutive quarters and the shortfalls are accelerating. Comparable-store sales are negative, and Chen feels that recent initiatives to beef up its grocery and pharmacy offerings aren't resonating with shoppers. Chen singles out the decline in fill-in traffic, customers that come in to grab just an item or two on the fly. Whether those lost customers are turning to Wal-Mart or online retailers, the point is that they're not doing it at Target.  Chen is no longer bullish on Target. He's slashing his price target on the "cheap chic" retailer from $75 to $68. Sam Walton would be proud If Target is losing share to Wal-Mart and online retailers, it's probably a good thing that Wal-Mart is acquiring Jet.com to gain some more skin in the dot-com game. That's just one of the reasons why Cowen's Chen turned bullish on the world's largest retailer yesterday.  Sales at Wal-Mart are holding up better than at Target. U.S. comps have been positive for eight consecutive quarters, and traffic is also on the rise. Chen feels that we're still in the early innings of Wal-Mart's revival. The chain's investments in training and higher wages are elevating the shopping experience, resulting in two-year highs in customer satisfaction surveys. Perhaps more important for Wal-Mart's reputation as a shrewd provider of roll-back pricing, the extra investments in its workforce haven't gotten in the way of its aggressive pricing on merchandise. Chen is boosting his price target on Wal-Mart stock from $76 to $83. When did Target stop being cool? It's easy to pin the blame on the data breach during the 2013 holiday shopping season. It ultimately settled two years later, but exposing roughly 40 million credit and debit card accounts isn't something that "Tar-zhay" has been able to overcome.  Yield chasers may gravitate to Target's 3.5% payout, beefier than Wal-Mart's still-impressive 2.8% rate. However, Wal-Mart's the one with momentum clearly in its corner for a change. Shoppers see it, and now another analyst does, too.   Rick Munarriz has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Fri, Nov 18, 2016, 14:54 GMT - UK Markets close in 1 hr 36 mins UK Grocer Morrisons On Cusp Of Quiet Revolution, But Doubts RemainReuters - UK Focus – Tue, Sep 13, 2016 07:00 BST Share 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print Shopping trolleys are parked at a Morrisons supermarket in south London, Britain August 19, 2016. Picture taken … Eighteen months after Chief Executive David Potts took over, the retailer is on course to return to profit growth this yearafter four years of falls caused largely by the rapid advance of German discounters Aldi and Lidl. That would put Morrisons, the fourth-largest supermarketgroup, on a par with market leader Tesco, which is expected to post a small rise, and ahead of second-biggestplayer Sainsbury which is set to post another fall. Analysts forecast Morrisons will report underlying pretaxprofit of 150 million pounds ($200 million) for the first halfof the year on Thursday, up from 141 million in the same periodof 2015. But Potts has yet to win over the doubters. Shares in the firm, which is based in the northern English city of Bradford, have risen 17 percent in the last year but remain a little below 204 pence, where they were when he joined on March 16, 2015. Over 60 percent of analysts rate the stock as "underperform". Morrisons is still losing market share but this is due to Potts's decision to close about 30 stores and sell a loss-making local convenience chain. On the measure of sales at stores openfor over a year, he has made significant progress. The firm has reported two consecutive quarters oflike-for-like sales growth, is expected to report a third on Thursday and given current forecasts is likely to be thestrongest of the big four, which also includes Wal-Mart's Asda, on that measure over the first half. There is also some evidence that the group may be in astronger position than its peers to cope with the consequencesof Britain's vote to leave the European Union. More tangibly, two deals with Amazon and Ocado to sell Morrisons products online could also boost profit. PATRIARCH Ken Morrison, the firm's boss for half a century and stillits Life President, gives what by his standards is a ringing endorsement of Potts. "I think he's doing very well, but there'sstill a lot of room for improvement," the 84-year-old son of thecompany's founder told Reuters. By contrast, the patriarch of a family that still ownsalmost 10 percent of the group once described the strategypursued by Potts's predecessor Dalton Philips as "bullshit". Potts, 59, joined Morrisons after 39 years with Tesco wherehe began by stacking shelves. His initial task was to steady theship after the group lost ground in its traditional northernmarket under Philips. Potts has slashed prices, narrowing the gap with thediscounters. He has replenished shelves more rapidly, tailored products to local tastes and improved service with, for example, more self-scan and express checkouts. Analysts say he has also improved the look and condition ofthe group's 492 stores and sharpened up marketing, emphasising its army of more than 9,000 trained butchers, bakers,fishmongers and other specialists who prepare more food in-storethan in other British supermarkets. The changes appear popular. Like-for-like transactions wereup 3.1 percent in the first quarter, with sales volume growth up 3.3 percent. Analysts at Jefferies International, who have a 'buy' ratingon the stock, say the firm is misunderstood. "Rarely have we seen such a negative combination of viewsboth from investors and sell siders," they said, noting thatabout 21 percent of Morrisons' freefloat stock is on loan forshort-selling by investors who expect the price to fall. NAYSAYERS Naysayers highlight the intensely competitive nature of theBritish grocery market, saying Potts needs to go even further onprice cuts, and fear a fight back by industry laggard Asda, theBritish arm of U.S. giant Wal-Mart. Morrisons has invested heavily in food production andpacking and now has 14 plants, making it Britain's secondbiggest food manufacturer and most integrated food retailer. While data is sparse, Morrisons says it imports less of thefood it sells than the 40 percent industry average. This would make it less exposed than rivals to the pound'sfall of 9 percent against the euro and 11 percent against thedollar after Britons opted for Brexit. Potts has cut pricestwice since the referendum on June 23. Morrisons also has a very small non-food offer, shunning thetrend of other big supermarkets which sell everything from coffee makers to washing machines and TVs. With many of thosegoods imported, here too Morrisons is less exposed to thecurrency swings. It is also less exposed to the risk of a post-Brexit economic slowdown and a resulting drop in consumer confidence which would particularly damage demand for bigger purchases. Such a slowdown has yet to materialise but remains expected bymany economists. Phoenix Asset Management, which owns nearly 1 percent of Morrisons according to Reuters data, has estimated the firm'sfood production capacity has grown to about three times the sizeit was a decade ago. However, it says productivity, or volumegrowth, has not kept track, meaning it has scope to raise output. A wholesale supply deal struck by Potts with U.S. onlinegiant Amazon in February gives Morrisons the opportunity toincrease volume with little additional capital expenditure,boosting profitability. Amazon's own assault on the UK grocery market is focused onLondon, where Morrisons is weak and has little share to lose butwhere Tesco and Sainsbury's are strong. Morrisons is also benefiting from its own belated moveonline through a partnership with Ocado, a deal that Potts re-negotiated, paying less upfront and holding on to moreprofit. It also wants to expand the wholesale of its own-label foodsthrough an alliance with Motor Fuel Group (MFG) Britain's secondlargest independent forecourt operator. BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH Morrisons has significantly strengthened its balance sheet,with net debt forecast to be as low as 1.4 billion pounds ($1.86billion) by the end of its 2016-17 year, down from a peak of2.82 billion pounds in 2014. Clive Black, analyst at the group's broker Shore Capital,says Morrisons stands apart with a lease-adjusted netdebt/earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisationand rent (EBITDAR) ratio of 2.4 times. This compares with aforecast of 3.9 times for Sainsbury and 4.6 times for Tesco. Black said that if trading remains sound and debt reduction continues, Morrisons may be able to consider something to please shareholders, such as a share buyback, over the next 18 months.   Share 0 Tweet 0 Share0 Print The last thing UK insurers need is more strangulating regulation Telegraph - 1 hour 3 minutes ago The last thing UK insurers need is more strangulating regulation … More » - Sponsored  Volkswagen is spiking 30,000 jobs as part of a huge restructuring programme Business Insider UK Finance - 6 hours ago The German carmaker Volkswagen is axing about 30,000 jobs over the next five years as part of a huge restructuring programme.

Aldi coming to Stuart; Walmart Neighborhood Markets planned for Port St. Lucie, Vero Beach Kelly Tyko , kelly.tyko@tcpalm.com 6:13 p.m. EDT September 12, 2016 The grand opening for the new Aldi at 3937 S.E. U.S. 1 is Sept. 15. The first 100 shoppers will receive store gift certificates, free reusable bags, samples and entry in a contest to win free produce for a year. (Photo: KELLY TYKO/TREASURE COAST NEWSPAPERS) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Just because a store is small, doesn’t mean you can’t save big. I’ve found this to be the case at the Treasure Coast’s new wave of smaller grocery stores, especially no-frills discount grocery retailer Aldi. The German grocer opens its third store here Thursday in Stuart at the southeast corner of U.S. 1 and Southeast Miami Avenue near the Wal-Mart Supercenter. Another Aldi is expected to open this winter in Port St. Lucie. Not to be outdone, Wal-Mart is continuing to bring its smaller grocery-only stores to the region. Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market stores are scheduled to open early next year in Vero Beach and Port St. Lucie. The smaller stores — a typical Aldi is 18,539 square feet and a Neighborhood Market is one-fifth the size of a Supercenter — make shopping trips faster. New Aldi Aldi, one of the world’s largest grocery chains, is short for “Albrecht Discount,” named after brothers and original owners Karl and Theo Albrecht. A California offshoot of Aldi operates the trendier Trader Joe’s, a gourmet and specialty grocer whose closest stores are in Palm Beach Gardens and Wellington. The grand opening for the new Aldi, at 3937 S.E. U.S. 1, begins with a ribbon cutting at 8:45 a.m. After the ceremony, the first 100 shoppers will receive store gift certificates, free reusable bags, samples and entry in a contest to win free produce for a year. On Wednesday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., shoppers can get a sneak peek and make their first purchases at the new store. “We are pleased to bring our first store to Stuart to help customers get high-quality products at everyday low prices,” said Chris Hewitt, Aldi’s Royal Palm Beach division vice president, in a news release. “We challenge shoppers to switch from national brands to our high-quality exclusive brands and stretch their dollars without compromising quality.” Like with past Aldi grand openings, I expect many dedicated shoppers will line up early or possibly camp out. Aldi opens its third Treasure Coast store Sept. 15 in Stuart at the southeast corner of U.S. 1 and Southeast Miami Avenue near the Walmart Supercenter.  (Photo: KELLY TYKO/TREASURE COAST NEWSPAPERS) However, a competing grand opening — the region’s first Wawa also opens Thursday in Stuart at the southeast corner of Kanner Highway and Monterey Road — might split the crowds. Aldi stores primarily carry items most commonly purchased at grocery stores and don’t have pharmacy, bakery and deli departments. The store brands are more than 1,300 products and the company says it keeps prices low by using a warehouse layout and minimal staffing. Another cost-saving measure is customers “rent” shopping carts for a quarter. As long as you return your cart, you’ll get the quarter back. You also need to bring your own bags and then bag your own groceries. Since Aldi started accepting credit cards in March, I’ve been a regular shopper and my favorite things to purchase are produce and eggs because of how low the prices are. Because of the store’s generous “Double Guarantee,” I’m willing to be adventurous and try other products. With the guarantee, if you’re not 100 percent satisfied with a product, bring it back and Aldi will replace the product and refund your money. Future stores Two Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market stores are under construction and more could be in the works. Like the region’s first market in St. Lucie West, the old Vero Beach Albertsons, which closed in June 2012, is being replaced by a grocery-only Wal-Mart. A second Port St. Lucie store is being built at the northwest corner of Port St. Lucie Boulevard and Yale Street, north of Darwin Boulevard. A Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market also could replace the Fort Pierce Winn-Dixie that closed in 2013 on U.S. 1 in the Kmart plaza, according to plans on real estate website LoopNet. Wal-Mart officials would not comment on this but if it happens perhaps Aldi would open a store nearby too. Not far from where the Port St. Lucie Wal-Mart is under construction, the city’s second Aldi is being built at Gatlin Boulevard and Brighton Street and expected to open this winter, Hewitt said in an email statement. But what about an Aldi in Indian River County? While preliminary plans were filed for a location on State Road 60 near the Wal-Mart Supercenter earlier this year, formal plans haven’t been filed yet with the county. The proposed store could go in a plaza on a 9.5-acre lot between the Applebee’s and Sonny’s BBQ being proposed by Konover South, the same developer of the Stuart Aldi. Although Hewitt said he had no details he could share about a possible Indian River or Vero Beach location, I firmly believe the company will eventually open a store in the county. If not on State Road 60, maybe near the new Wal-Mart. And since both Aldi and Wal-Mart are continuing to add stores throughout Florida, I think we’ll have more places to shop in the future.

Police describe what took place during the attempted robbery that ended with one attacker dead and the woman and one Good Samaritan in the hospital. Laura Bauer, Joe Ledford and Robert A. Cronkleton The Kansas City Star Police are still searching for one of two attackers who struck Sunday afternoon in a parking lot near the Wal-Mart store at 65th Street and Maurer Road in Shawnee. Joe Ledford jledford@kcstar.com 1 of 2 i By Matt Campbell mcampbell@kcstar.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story A man arrested Sunday in an attack at a Shawnee Wal-Mart was released after police questioned him and determined he was not involved. Several teams of police officers were back on the case Monday working leads in the search for a second suspect in an incident that left one attacker dead, a woman injured and a Good Samaritan shot. The dead attacker, who was shot by a separate Good Samaritan, was identified as 28-year-old John W. Simmons III of Kansas City. The woman who was attacked Sunday in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart in Shawnee was a 39-year-old Kansas City, Kan., resident. Police said Monday she had been released from the hospital. The Good Samaritan who was shot when he intervened to help her was a 33-year-old Kansas City man. He had surgery Sunday night and remained in the hospital in serious condition Monday, said Shawnee police spokesman Maj. Dan Tennis. Police said the woman was attacked about 1:30 p.m. Sunday as she was putting her infant in a car seat after shopping at the store near Shawnee Mission Parkway and Maurer Road. Two people approached and the woman was struck on the head, police said. A Good Samaritan who tried to help her was shot and critically wounded by one of the attackers. At that point the second Good Samaritan, a 36-year-old De Soto man, came forward and shot one of the attackers. Police said Monday the woman who was assaulted did not know her attackers. Police also said the first Good Samaritan was not armed. The second Good Samaritan was interviewed and released. According to Missouri court records, a person whom Simmons had a child in common with filed a protective order against him in December 2013. Simmons was ordered to stay away from and refrain from communicating with the petitioner. According to online federal court records, a man named John W. Simmons III, of the same age as the man killed, was under indictment in U.S. District Court in Western Missouri with possession with intent to distribute cocaine, with having a firearm while trafficking drugs and with being a felon in possession of a firearm. Soon after the attack, officers with a K9 unit located and arrested a man east of the store and said he was suspected of being the second attacker. Tennis said he fit the description from witnesses and he was located in the area. But on Monday police said they did not believe he was involved in the attack. He was released later Sunday. “The man who was arrested yesterday shortly after this incident has been determined not to be involved in the crime,” according to a police statement. “Currently several teams of police officers are working on leads.” Anyone with information is asked to call the Tips TIPS Hotline at 816-474-8477 or Shawnee police at 913-631-2150.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it The company wants to expand the Capital Plaza Walmart. Neighbors are divided over whether that’s a good idea. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) By Arelis Hernández September 12 Nearly 10 years ago, Walmart representatives stood with Prince George’s County residents to announce an unusual agreement that would create the retail behemoth’s first inside-the-Beltway store. The Walmart in Landover Hills would not sell firearms or alcohol or stay open 24 hours. It would hire locally and, among other things, encourage the kind of economic development residents wanted along this stretch of Annapolis Road, such as nice restaurants and higher-end retail. Now Walmart is seeking county legislative approval for a 35,200-square-foot expansion at what has become one of its most heavily shopped locations. And those same neighbors are standing against it, saying the discount retailer has only lived up to part of the bargain. The Walmart at Capital Plaza does not sell guns or booze, and it is closed from midnight to 6 a.m. About one-third of its employees are hired from within the county. But the relationship with residents has broken down, activists say, as conditions inside and outside the store deteriorated. Shopping carts from Walmart have been found strewn across neighborhood streets. Cars have been stolen from the parking lot. And worst of all, residents say, businesses closed instead of opened. The primary grocer, Safeway, shut its doors a few years after Walmart arrived. [Wonkblog: The ‘Wal-Mart’ effect — how it squeezes workers] “Walmart has been a huge disappointment to the community,” said activist Denise Hamler, who leads the Community Standards Coalition organization that devised the nine-point agreement in 2006 and was among the activists who attended a hearing Monday before the Prince George’s County Council. “We were promised that once built, they could attract other retailers,” Hamler said. “That failed to happen.” Council member Dannielle Glaros (D-Riverdale Park), whose district includes the Walmart, requested that the full council examine the county planning board’s tentative approval of the store expansion, which opponents say is large enough to have warranted a more thorough review process. The council has scheduled a vote for next Monday on whether to reverse or uphold the expansion plan. Glaros said she will make her position known at or before that meeting; usually in land-use cases, the council supports the recommendation of the lawmaker who represents the area. Walmart spokesman Phillip Keene said the company has kept its promises to the community and can address the loss of Safeway through the expansion. “For years, our Capital Plaza customers have been asking that we offer them a full assortment of groceries,” Keene said in a statement. “The proposed expansion of our store is designed to do just that.” [When Walmart moves in, local businesses suffer. Right?] Randall Levitt, president of the Nellis Corp., which manages the property, said the 2008 recession slowed efforts to fill storefronts in the complex. He said interest from retailers has increased, in part because of Walmart’s proposed expansion. Plans to bring Pollo Campero, a rotisserie chicken fast-food restaurant, and Royal Farms, a gas station and convenience store, are underway. “There have not been any promises broken,” Levitt said. “But the outcomes have not been as quick as I might’ve hoped.” Cheverly Mayor Mike Callahan testified that his residents are not opposed to the expansion because they think it might yield the economic development results they have long desired. “If you want to see development at this site, and every one does, the question then becomes, ‘Does the expansion help accomplish that or does it hurt that development?’ ” Callahan said in an interview. “This Walmart exists, it’s in our community. It is not going away and it’s important that it be improved.” But other Prince George’s residents said they were so frustrated by conditions inside and outside the store that they no longer could trust the retailer. “I feel like I’m being victimized by a slumlord,” resident Richard Bailey said. “There is absolutely no reason why that site can’t look better.” Another resident, Delvin Champagne, said he would support expansion “if it was tied to a broader plan for development for that shopping center.” Council members and attorneys on Monday debated whether the project should have gone through a more extensive approval process because of its potential adverse impact on surrounding neighborhoods. Typically, projects of this size would undergo a special exception — a deeper review that invites more community input before approval. local md-politics Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Show Caption Hide Caption Previous Next SHAWNEE, Kan. - Walmart told 41 Action News it plans to add private security to patrol the parking lot of the Walmart Supercenter where a shooting occurred Sunday by end of the month. According to a company spokesperson, it's been in the works for months. Sunday's shooting was a gruesome sight that Wendy Macrorie said she's never seen. A good Samaritan shot and killed a man after the man allegedly attacked a woman with a child. Walmart employees alerted customers. "One of the workers over the intercom said you have to wait here for five more minutes...cause they were just barricading the doors," Macrorie said. The particular store on Maurer Road is no stranger to Shawnee police. 41 Action News obtained the Shawnee Police Department's list of addresses where officers respond the most. As for businesses in Shawnee, this Walmart ranks first on the list for three years in a row. In 2014, officers were called to the Supercenter 215 times. The following year police responded 277 times. And as of last month, cops have shown up 152 times so far this year. "When people need help they call the police and we feel like we should respond," Major Dan Tennis, a spokesperson with the Shawnee Police Department, said. During a recent Walmart grand re-opening in Kansas City, the company touted its security. "I think in any retail situation you see representation of our great police forces," Josh Williams, the Walmart store director, said. “We certainly want to make sure we always create and do everything we do to create a safe shopping experience for all of our customers." Major Tennis said the retail giant and his department keep an open dialogue about the high number of calls. "When you have an area that draws in a lot of folks from a lot of different areas you're going to have police calls and that's why we're here," Major Tennis said. Walmart spokesperson Brian Nick sent 41 Action News the following statement: “In the coming weeks and months, we will continue our increased outreach to law enforcement as part of our ongoing commitment to meet our customer’s and associate’s expectations of a safe and enjoyable shopping experience. The importance of this issue is recognized at the highest levels of the company and we are investing in people and technology to support our stores. We are clear that no level of violence is acceptable in our stores and will continue to make this a key priority.” ------   Andres Gutierrez can be reached at andres.gutierrez@kshb.com Follow him on Twitter:  Follow @AFGutierrez Connect on Facebook:   Copyright 2016 Scripps Media, Inc.

CDT September 12, 2016 Isaac Rousso (Photo: Courtesy - State Fair Treats) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST PLANO -- A well-known face from the Big Tex Choice Award at the State Fair of Texas is making a move to bring his fried foods to customers all year long. Isaac Rousso plants to open State Fair Treats inside the Walmart located at Coit Road and Highway 190 later this September. The restaurant will feature a 45-item menu “celebrating the treats families enjoy every year when they make an annual pilgrimage to the fair,” according to a news release. It’s just the first of a big rollout for State Fair Treats. More North Texas locations are planned to open in Walmart locations in the coming year, and there are plans on the horizon to open locations nationwide, though no sites were specified. A photo of Isaac Rousso from an appearance on WFAA's Good Morning Texas.   (Photo: Courtesy - State Fair Foods) Rousso’s Cookie Fries were named the Most Creative treat in this year’s Big Tex Choice Award, and he’s also won in the past with his Smoky Bacon Margarita, Deep Fried Cuban Roll, and Fried Pop Tart. Russo also plans for seasonal menu items to be available throughout the year. Russo, a Dallas native, says Walmart reached out to him during the 2015 State Fair of Texas with the idea for the restaurant. “Walmart was looking for a creative new food concept to energize high profile locations,” Rousso said. “During the State Fair of Texas, we have the opportunity to serve more than 2 million people during the fair’s 24-day run. At our first Walmart location alone, we’ll have the chance to see 1.5-2 million people per year.” A look at the interior of the first location of State Fair Treats.   (Photo: Courtesy - State Fair Treats) Rousso’s family is well-known among fair concessionaires. They began operating a single booth, Taste of Cuba, but now also manage the Magnolia Beer Garden, Magnolia Pavilion, Magnolia Smokehouse, and the Craft Beer Terrace. “Isaac and his family embody what the State Fair is all about — families working hard to help other families have a good time during their visit,” said Carey Risinger, senior vice president of food, beverage and retail for the State Fair of Texas. State Fair Treats will begin offering its breakfast, lunch, and dinner menus on Sept. 20 at its first Plano location.

The real estate magnate got $4.96 billion in free earned media in the year leading up to the presidential election, according to data from tracking firm mediaQuant. Over the past 12 months, the president-elect received more than $800 million in free earned broadcast media, compared to $666 million for Clinton, and $2.6 billion in free earned online news attention, compared to $1.6 billion for his rival. He edged out her and other major political names in American and worldwide newspapers as well.

Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen on Monday raised his rating on Wal-Mart to "outperform" from "market perform," saying it's only one-third of the way through the upgrades to its store experience. Improvements so far have included better training and pay for its workers, resulting in stores being cleaner and more convenient to shop. They also helped the retailer log a 1.6 percent increase in domestic comparable sales in the recently ended quarter. As Wal-Mart invests more of its own dollars so it can lower prices for customers, the retailer should continue grabbing share from dollar stores, grocers and fellow mass merchant Target (TGT). Price cuts are already showing up on Wal-Mart's shelves. A new study by Jefferies found that between June and August, Wal-Mart widened the pricing gap versus Dollar General (DG), Family Dollar (DLTR) and most grocers. Target has responded by lowering its prices on non-grocery items. But Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder, who reiterated his "buy" rating on Wal-Mart, said he expects Wal-Mart to step up its investments in non-grocery pricing during the fall and holiday seasons. "We are seeing Wal-Mart's strategic initiatives beginning to pay off as traffic and basket grew in [the second quarter]," Binder said. Whereas Wal-Mart's traffic rose for the seventh straight quarter, Target welcomed fewer shoppers into its stores for the first time in a year and a half. Traffic also slipped at Dollar General during the quarter. In tandem with its upgrade of Wal-Mart, Cowen's Chen downgraded shares of Target to "market perform" from "outperform." "We believe Target has solid market share in the bigger 'stock-up' trips for customers, but the increasing price competition from Wal-Mart and the convenience of Amazon (AMZN) Prime will make the recent 'fill-in' trip weakness for Target persist," Chen said. He noted that Amazon has been seeing "explosive" growth in several categories, most notably grocery and other consumables. Those account for roughly half of Target's sales. While Target is in the process of reworking its food assortment, including bringing in more organic and local products, Chen expressed concern the retailer is not moving fast enough to roll out changes. Meanwhile, he expects more speed bumps from the rebranding of Target's pharmacies into CVS (CVS) banners. "In our view, Wal-Mart can use its scale to compete on price to regain or maintain market share versus Amazon ... but Target cannot compete as easily," Chen said.

The Technical Take: Wal-Mart Lower After Mixed Q3 Report, Lower Guidance Stocks Mixed As Yellen Testimony Underway; Cisco, Wal-Mart Weigh On Dow (Investor's Business Daily) Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT) continues to invest in its pricing, which is triggering headaches for many of its traditional and non-traditional peers. Daniel Binder, a consumer and retailer analyst at Jefferies, commented in a research note on Monday that his August pricing work shows Wal-Mart has widened the gap with most competitors. Specifically, data gathered in the Charlotte, Houston and Phoenix markets show Wal-Mart's price advantage "widened" against dollar store chains including Dollar General Corp. (NYSE: DG) and Family Dollar. "Given the regional nature of price investment, we may not capture the full impact of what WMT is doing, but recent data shows it continues," Binder wrote. "DG had some price cuts during the observed periods too, but not as significant. Family Dollar has been less aggressive." Related Link: Kroger's Guidance Cut Looks Modest Relative To Peers' Outlooks Binder acknowledged that Wal-Mart benefited in the second quarter from better terms with its vendors, lower transportation costs, lower shrink and lower markdowns. In addition, the analyst "would not be surprised" if the retailing giant details to investors additional cost out initiatives in October during its analyst day to fund additional price investment activities. Binder also noted that within the grocery space, Wal-Mart introduced price cuts in all three of the markets that compare favorably to Target Corporation (NYSE: TGT), which was flattish. Traditional grocers were mostly flat to slightly up. Finally, within the non-grocery space, Target narrowed the gap to Wal-Mart but Wal-Mart could "step up" with its seasonal business in the fall and holiday season. Shares of Wal-Mart remain Buy rated with an unchanged $86 price target. Full ratings data available on Benzinga Pro. Do you have ideas for articles/interviews you'd like to see more of on Benzinga?

Like us on Facebook. Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now Isaac Rousso, who found deep-fried fame through the State Fair of Texas, will open a year-round restaurant next week inside a Plano Wal-mart. Called State Fair Treats, the Plano outpost is expected to open Sept. 20, as the first in a region-wide, then potentially nationwide expansion. The move shows Wal-mart's continued willingness to offer restaurant food beyond McDonald's and Subway, even though some past experiments, such as a deal with Dallas-based Pollo Campero, provided less-than-stellar results. And it gives the Dallas-born entrepreneur a chance to raise his profile beyond the reach of Big Tex. Rousso, who has six full-time, year-round workers, would like to see his restaurant concepts (he has more than one) expand into Wal-marts across the country. That means ramping up the kind of back office bulwark not typically used by the festival set. And while he's not planning a Jed Clampett-style move to Beverly Hills, Rousso knows that his life is about to change. "At the end of the day it's incredible that you have someone like Wal-mart believing in a small entrepreneurial guy and seeing the potential of what we can bring" to the table, he said, as curious shoppers snapped photos of the not-yet-open restaurant in Plano, which takes the place of a McDonald's. "The State Fair of Texas for me has been the greatest blessing that's ever come to my family. And the opportunities that were coming to us because of the State Fair, words can't describe it." Rousso's retro-themed diner, at 425 Coit Rd., Plano, near the President George Bush Turnpike, will feature a 45-item menu "celebrating the treats families enjoy every year when they make an annual pilgrimage to the fair," according to a news release about the project.

The annual event, held ahead of the State Fair of Texas, recognizes the best fried foods entered into consideration for sale at the fair. Rousso and his team won "Most Creative" for their entry.(G.J. McCarthy/The Dallas Morning News) Staff Photographer Rousso, 50, is known to many fair fare aficionados as a regular finalist and winner at the Big Tex Choice Award at the State Fair. This year, Rousso's Cookie Fries were named Most Creative. Past wins include his Smoky Bacon Margarita, Deep Fried Cuban Roll, and Fried Pop Tart. He launched a food truck selling the Cuban sandwiches about three years after the item's debut at the fair. He sees that as an item that might do well in a potential Miami Wal-mart location The Plano restaurant will be open from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. serving many fair foods like the cookie fries and funnel cake fries along with corn dogs, deep-fried hash browns stuffed with bacon and cheddar cheese and some new creations. He estimates his stores can bring in upwards of $1 million a year. By the end of next year he expects to have up to 15 restaurants open, including a location in Ennis. So far, the expansion is self-funded. Wal-mart is the landlord but not an investor, he said. Rousso serves as the chief executive of the newly formed Nationwide Restaurant Concessions Enterprises, based in Addison. The Plano Wal-mart will be the company's first brick-and-mortar location. Each store will have about a dozen workers. In the corporate office, there's a new head of operations, industry veteran Jacob Hunter. While a plumbing contractor labored mightily to get a sink ready for next week's opening, Rousso sat beneath a wall length mural showing the different iterations of Big Tex over the years. The serial experimenter, who's spent nearly a decade selling a variety of foods, describes the State Fair of Texas as "the heartbeat of everything I do." The 2015 State Fair provided the backdrop for Rousso's first date with Wal-mart executives. The nation's largest retailer had hired a consulting firm to look for new and innovative concepts. Members of that team approached Rousso during the annual food-athon and said Wal-mart wanted to talk. "Wal-mart was looking for a creative new food concept to energize high-profile locations," Rousso said. "They loved the idea of finding someone who was able to take an idea and constantly create something fresh and innovative. "They know that every fall, there's going to be something new on that menu," he said. "We're able to change and reinvent ourselves." "During the State Fair of Texas, we have the opportunity to serve more than 2 million people during the fair's 24-day run," he added. He estimates up to 2 million shoppers visit the Plano Wal-mart in a year. And that's one location. Wal-mart was not available to answer detailed questions about the Rousso deal. A spokeswoman said the "vast majority" of the more than 4,600 Wal-mart stores in the U.S. have leased space available. "Often, those spaces are leased to restaurants such as McDonald's, Subway, and other regional franchises," she said. She said most of the leased locations are occupied by national players. Rousso said Wal-mart knows his aim is to take his brand national, within Wal-mart, even if that means some of the big boys go away.  "There are many, many McDonald's that are going to be transitioning out" of Wal-mart stores, he said. "We're going to be looking at every opportunity as they transition out, to jump in." McDonald's could not be reached for comment. Rousso knows that just opening the door at Wal-mart does not guarantee success. Dallas-based Pollo Campero launched a highly publicized campaign to open in Wal-mart stores several years ago. Today most, if not all, of those locations have been replaced by other brands. Rousso thinks the "fun" factor will help his concept flourish. "It's a fun food experience," he said. "We're not just selling another cheeseburger." Also, he noted, up until now, his food has been available largely at festivals. Meaning there's more potential for diners to seek out his stores after the fair ends its run. He also knows that national expansion costs money. He's been in talks with some venture capital firms but has yet to find a love connection. Born in Dallas of Cuban immigrants, Rousso and his family have gone from operating a single booth, Taste of Cuba, at the State Fair to adding the Magnolia Beer Garden, Magnolia Pavilion, Magnolia Smokehouse, and most recently the Craft Beer Terrace. (His Magnolia operation is not related to the Magnolia-themed empire of Waco-based Chip and Joanna Gaines.) From the fair, Rousso fielded requests from multiple outdoor festivals in North Texas including Richard's Cottonwood and Taste Addison. "Isaac and his family embody what the State Fair is all about," Carey Risinger, Senior Vice President of Food, Beverage and Retail for the State Fair, said in a statement. "Families working hard to help other families have a good time during their visit." Related article:  Best food at this year's State Fair of Texas?

ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz Close ✕ By K. Oanh Ha Welspun India Ltd. shares slid as much as 5 per cent in Mumbai trading after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. stopped selling the supplier's Egyptian-cotton sheets over concerns that the products' origins may be mislabeled. The stock traded 4.7 per cent lower at Rs 54.15 as of 9:20 am local time. The world's largest retailer said on Friday that Welspun wasn't able to assure that the sheets are 100 per cent Egyptian cotton. Welspun's market value has dropped by about half since the controversy erupted August 19, when Target Corp. cut ties with the Indian vendor after discovering sheets and pillowcases that were labeled as premium Egyptian cotton were made with cheaper fiber. Unlike Target, Wal-Mart said it wouldn't end all business with Welspun. Wal-Mart's move is a further blow to Mumbai-based Welspun's image, as other household-name customers, including Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., and J.C. Penny Co. also review the authenticity of its products. The affected goods represent about 6 per cent of Welspun's total business, the Indian manufacturer founded by Balkrishan Goenka said Saturday. The company, which has said it had engaged a Big Four firm to audit its supply processes, also said it's putting stronger quality controls in place and adopting new labeling practices. Customers often pay a premium for Egyptian-cotton products because they are perceived to be softer and more durable. Sheets made from cotton grown in other countries don't always carry the same cachet among Americans. Wal-Mart sold the Welspun sheets and pillow cases under the names Better Homes & Gardens and Canopy. The company will offer refunds to customers who have purchased the sheets.

E-Commerce Is a Boon for Rural America, But Comes With a Price The Wall Street Journal. 9/11/2016 Laura Stevens Click to expand Replay Video Trump rode $5 billion in free media to the White House Donald Trump didn't spend nearly as much on advertising as typical presidential candidates, and he didn't have to -- he relied on billions of dollars of free mentions in media ranging from major TV news networks to Buzzfeed and Twitter instead. The real estate magnate got $4.96 billion in free earned media in the year leading up to the presidential election, according to data from tracking firm mediaQuant. Over the past 12 months, the president-elect received more than $800 million in free earned broadcast media, compared to $666 million for Clinton, and $2.6 billion in free earned online news attention, compared to $1.6 billion for his rival. He edged out her and other major political names in American and worldwide newspapers as well.

Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 68.74 -0.45 -0.65% FedEx Corp FDX ▼ 183.99 -1.09 -0.59% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 766.31 +9.91 +1.31% JC Penney Co Inc JCP ▼ 9.21 -0.22 -2.33% He was taping up a package a few months ago to one of the town’s 3,000 residents and noticed it contained a bottle of bleach. “It wasn’t lavender [scented] or anything,” he recalls. “It was just a bottle of plain Clorox.” Until five years ago, Mr. Bledsoe was the bearer of special orders, tractor parts and business deliveries to this area. Now, he delivers dog food, fruit snacks and Kleenex, among other things. His business has increased 30% during the past couple of years, he estimates. “It is getting out of hand,” he said, recently while driving his truck along a highway bordered by cotton fields. “They can find anything online. Literally anything.” E-commerce hasn’t just reached rural America, it is transforming it by providing small-town residents with big-city conveniences and the latest products. Contemporary fashion, such as Victoria Secret bathing suits or Tori Burch ballet flats—items that can’t be found at Dollar General—are easily shipped. Consumers increasingly are shopping online instead of driving, often long distances, to stores. Online shopping also brings with it deals and new entrepreneurial opportunities. These consumers, however, are the most expensive to serve for both retailers and delivery companies. According to Kantar Retail, about 73% of rural consumers—defined as those who drive at least 10 miles for everyday shopping—are now buying online versus 68% two years ago. Last year, 30% were members of Amazon Prime, up from 22% in 2014. Flowers Unlimited and Bratton Drug are about all that is left of a red-brick town square that just a couple of decades ago buzzed with three florists, restaurants and a furniture store. A Wal-Mart built in 1982 in Altus, Okla., about 20 miles away, brought residents choice, convenience and low prices. Now, online shopping is creating another retail revolution here that doesn’t require a half-hour drive to Wal-Mart or roughly 2½-hour drive to Oklahoma City. April Geralds, a security-firm support manager, recently bought her two teenage daughters designer Miss Me jeans for half price on Macys.com. Her family now has access to things “I didn’t ever think we would have,” said the Mangum resident. Residents here are even starting to buy groceries online because frequently it is cheaper than at the town’s United Supermarkets. A can of Bush’s Best Bold and Spicy Baked Beans cost $2.07 on Walmart.com recently, 22% less than at the United in Magnum, where it’s more expensive to transport goods. E-commerce has provided new opportunities for area residents to earn money. In Willow, Okla., Anneliese Rogers, a mother of three, raised $1,500 in one sitting by selling items from her closet on Facebook. Nearby, Kassandra Bruton mails up to 100 packages a week from her clothing store Trailer Trash. While e-commerce is great for rural America, it is expensive for retailers and delivery companies. The longest mail route in the country—a 187.6-mile daily loop for carrier Jim Ed Bull—runs from Mangum. The longer the drive and the fewer the packages per stop—known as delivery density—the lower the profit for the U.S. Postal Service, UPS and FedEx. UPS says one mile a day across its U.S. delivery fleet costs up to $50 million a year. UPS’s Mr. Bledsoe drives 56 miles nearly every day to deliver medicine to one customer—a veterinarian—on his route. To offset the cost, UPS and FedEx charge an extra $4 per package for remote residential deliveries. The prevalence of free shipping to consumers and the need to price items the same online and in stores, typically leaves retailers bearing this additional cost. For retailers, that adds to already steep costs. Shipping a container of Tide Pods laundry detergent from Atlanta to urban Oklahoma City is estimated to cost a retailer $11.44—already more than the approximately $11 price of the item itself, according to an analysis by Spend Management Experts. Shipping the pods to Mangum costs $15.65. It is a double-whammy for retailers, which also are losing in-store customers to e-commerce. Wal-Mart built its business by combining muscular buying power and a vast transportation network to provide a wide variety of items and low prices to small towns like Mangum. About a dozen consumers in Mangum said they shop online to reduce the need for trips to the Wal-Mart in Altus. Angela Monroe, a dental assistant and mother of two, now goes once a week instead of two or three times, and does the rest of her shopping online. Customers also tend to spend more when they shop in stores. The Wal-Mart store in Altus is near an Air Force base and Western Oklahoma State College and gets strong foot traffic, said a Wal-Mart Stores spokesman, though he wouldn’t provide numbers. On a recent weekday, 80 miles away in Lawton, Okla., Central Mall’s food court is busy, but shoppers are scarce. A handful of vacant storefronts promise that shops are “coming soon,” and a J.C. Penney is “closed for renovations.” Greg Maloney, retail CEO at Jones Lang LaSalle, which manages Central Mall, says retailers are opening fewer and smaller stores in rural areas in an effort to find the right balance with online shopping. E-commerce has changed life for Flowers Unlimited, the last remaining Mangum florist and gift shop on the town’s square. While it has lost much of its bridal and baby registry business to online retailers, it has one big advantage: There is still a need for last-minute gifts, says owner Darla Heatly. “They can’t do e-commerce if they don’t plan ahead,” she adds.

 Walmart under fire for 'disgusting' 9/11 tribute Hayley Peterson Sep. 8, 2016, 11:15 AM 53,505 facebook linkedin twitter email print Walmart is under fire for using packages of soda cans as a tribute to 9/11 ahead of the 15th anniversary of the terrorist attacks against the US.    A Florida Walmart arranged the packages to look like the twin towers, according to a photo tweeted by shopper Shawn Richard on Monday.  "We stopped and stared at it like, oh my god," Richard told BuzzFeed News, which first reported on the display. "Nobody seemed to be noticing it, it wasn’t very crowded, and I got the feeling that it had just been assembled. So we took some pics and went on our way." Florida c'mon man pic.twitter.com/HU4y2rxgFG — Shawn (@online_shawn) September 6, 2016 A printed sign hung above the display advertising Walmart's rollback prices for the soft drinks. Another sign hanging above the display read "We will never forget" with a photo of the twin towers and the logos for Walmart and Coca-Cola.  All of the sodas that were part of the display were Coca-Cola products. Walmart told Business Insider that the display was removed Wednesday afternoon. Coca-Cola did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The display was criticized on Twitter as insensitive and exploitive.  @online_shawn @Walmart Walmart, this is disgusting and unacceptable.

Wendy Russell Macrorie had been shopping at the store in Shawnee, Kansas, US, on Sunday when a bloody shoot-out erupted outside. The horrifying incident began when a 39-year-old woman was ambushed by two men and hit with an object. Two Good Samaritans rushed to her aid, but one of the attackers, John W. Simmons III, spun round and shot one of them several times. The other man then whipped out his gun and fatally shot Simmons. Simmons's victim was rushed to hospital, where he remains in critical condition today. Wendy Russell Macrorie has been criticised after filming a dead body in a Walmart car park (Photo: Facebook / Wendy Russell Macrone) The man who fatally shot Simmon's was interviewed by police but later released without charge. Simmons's accomplice is believed to still be on the run. But one Walmart shopper has been criticised after she posted footage of the aftermath of the incident on Facebook - which has since been taken down.

In the footage she said: "So this is interesting. I am at Walmart, which I hate going to, and this is happening in front of my car." Wendy was criticised for smiling in the footage (Photo: Facebook / Wendy Russell Macrone) "Apparently right in front of my car two men have been shot. I was inside buying some light bulbs and stuff — an inner tube for my son for his bike, and everybody was telling everybody not to go outside. " So you be careful when you're going to Walmart. This is really scary and insane and grotesque, and I am freaked out." At the end of the video Macrorie said, "Gross, gross — don't come to Walmart!"

Shawnee police said 27-year-old Arthur Fred Wyatt III of Overland Park was charged in Johnson County District Court with attempted first-degree murder, attempted aggravated kidnapping and attempted aggravated robbery. A 39-year-old Kansas City, Kan., woman who had been shopping at the Wal-Mart at Shawnee Mission Parkway and Maurer Road was attacked in the parking lot about 1:30 p.m. Sunday. Two men approached her while she was putting her child in a safety seat, police said. She was struck in the head. A Good Samaritan tried to intervene, and one of the attackers shot him. A second Good Samaritan then shot one of the attackers, killing him. The other attacker escaped on foot. A man who fit that person’s description was detained but later released. Wyatt was arrested Tuesday. Shawnee police spokesman Maj. Dan Tennis said he could not discuss details of the arrest because the case was now in the hands of the district attorney. The Good Samaritan who was shot, a 33-year-old Kansas City man, remained in serious condition in a hospital Tuesday morning. The woman who was attacked was released from a hospital on Monday. The attacker who was killed was identified Monday as 28-year-old John W.

Christopher Michael Ono, 25, is charged with second-degree felony theft, as well as misdemeanor charges of possession of a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. Ono made his first appearance in 3rd District Court Monday morning before Judge Robert Adkins. He was appointed a public defender and bail was set at $15,000. On Sept. 7, Tooele City police were dispatched to the Walmart in Tooele in reference to a report of a stolen vehicle that had been located in the store’s parking lot, according to a probable cause statement. The car had been listed as stolen out of West Valley City in the National Crime Information Center database. When Tooele City police officers arrived on scene, they located the car and found Ono inside, the statement said. When officers searched Ono prior to his arrest, they found a white, crystalline substance, suspected to be methamphetamine. A subsequent search of the vehicle located a backpack that contained drug paraphernalia, including tin foil, a glass pipe with burn residue, syringes and small plastic baggies, according to the statement. Police also found files and pry tools, such as those used to conduct burglaries, inside the backpack. A filed piece of silverware with tape wrapped around one end was located in the ignition of the stolen car, according to police. Ono is expected back in 3rd District Court on Oct. 4 at 9 a.m. for a roll call hearing before Adkins.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it A Walmart in Hyattsville, Md. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) By Arelis R. Hernández September 13 Follow @arelisrhdz Prince George’s County Council members voted Tuesday to block Walmart’s proposed expansion of a store in Landover Hills, reversing a decision by the county Planning Board that had sparked an outcry from community activists. Council member Dannielle M. Glaros (D-Riverdale Park), in whose district the Walmart is located, said the 35,200-square-foot extension was too large to be approved by county planning officials and should have undergone a more thorough screening. A day after a public hearing was held on the matter, Glaros made a motion to reject the Planning Board’s approval, and council members — who act as the District Council on land-use matters — voted unanimously in favor. Walmart can appeal the council’s decision in court or pursue expansion approval through the county’s special-exception process — a more rigorous zoning review that allows regulators to more closely examine the project details and creates more opportunity for public input. Neighborhood and community activists have long complained about security and conditions in and around the big-box store in the 6200 block of Annapolis Road. Prince George’s County Council member Dannielle M. Glaros (D-Riverdale Park) (Courtesy of Danielle Glaros's campaign) They said that, although Walmart promised to help spur additional development around the store when it sought to open there 10 years ago, new retail offerings have been sparse, and some well-regarded stores have shut down. Walmart said its efforts were slowed by the Great Recession and pointed out that some new stores are coming. It said the proposed expansion would make possible a much fuller grocery section to help make up for the departure of a Safeway. Denise Hamler, who leads a coalition of organizations dedicated to upholding the decade-old agreement between the community and Walmart, said she was “thrilled” at the council’s action. “We have been working on this for years,” Hamler said. “We cannot support an expansion until they respond to our issues with the current store.” But Walmart spokesman Phillip Keene said in a statement Tuesday evening that “there is a lot to like about our plan and, most importantly, our customers have told us they want the improvements. “We were ready to invest in the store and the community, so we’re pretty disappointed in today’s decision,’’ Keene said. “At this time, we are reviewing our options in terms of next steps.” local md-politics Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Whenever I go to Exton Mall, I usually head first to Chico’s, where the name of the store is printed on the labels of its blouses, skirts, slacks and dresses. At Wal-Mart near Kennett Square, I start shopping at aisles filled with food items from well-known food manufacturers such as Kraft Foods. During occasional jaunts through Concord Pets in Dilworthtown, I initially look at products from well-known dealers. Iams small chunks anyone? In other words, I am extremely wary about buying no-name products. Advertisement I know, I know, I know. Generic products at the CVS and Wegman’s stores in Chester County sometimes surpass big-name brands. But I’m not buying it. My preference for well-known labels over generic merchandise stems from numerous experiences over the years where a copycat item failed to measure up to my expectations. Have you ever tried mystery ice cream trying to compete with Breyer’s and Ben and Jerry’s on price rather than quality? Case closed. As a brand aficionado, I have been intrigued in recent years as the concept has expanded to encompass human beings as well as inanimate products. According to innumerable business gurus, you are expected to apply the term “brand” to yourself as a verb, as an adjective and as a noun – a significant grammatical as well as business challenge. What do I mean? Specifically, you need to brand yourself, to become branded and to establish yourself as a brand. The pressure is enough to make you run out for a Dunkin Donut or Starbucks coffee just to quiet your emotions. So what exactly is personal branding? “It’s about unearthing what is true and unique about you and letting everyone know about it,” writes David Tyreman in a book called “World Famous: How to Give Your Business and You a Kick-Ass Brand Identity.” “As a brand, you are a free agent. You have the freedom to create the career path that links your talents and interests with the right position and the ability to move both vertically and horizontally now and throughout your career.” So how exactly do you go about branding yourself? Here are a few ideas: • Expand your vision. The first step is to stop looking at yourself as an employee. You are more, much more, than your current job. Everything you do today as a corporate executive, a nonprofit director or a fledging entrepreneur will stay with you throughout your career. The days of working from graduation to retirement at the same company are screeching to a halt. • Zone in on your strengths. Turning yourself into a brand takes planning. Before proceeding to enumerate your best qualities, you need to figure out what they are, through any one of a combination of techniques. Take a formal assessment such as the Myers Briggs Type Indicator. Ask family and friends about your best traits. Think about tasks and roles that make you feel satisfied with your contribution to the world. Afterward, compile the information to get a sense of a viable brand. • Pinpoint your uniqueness. Usually, it’s a combination of factors; you are a one-of-a-kind package deal. Let’s say you landscape properties in upscale Westtown Township. And you have a passion for installing waterfalls on front lawns. Plus you have a horticulture degree from a well-known college. Put those characteristics together and you might come up with a brand statement such as “I am a landscaper with a degree in horticulture who will build a cascading fountain in your yard to enhance the beauty and value of your home.” • Identify the benefits you provide. Sound like sales? You bet. If you repair high-end electronic equipment, for instance, I suggest you create a brand statement focusing on the payoff to your customer rather than to yourself. An example: “My staff and I will be in your home or office to fix your computer within 48 hours of your call.” Your prospect then has hope that they will be back on line sometime this week, not next month or, heaven forbid, next year. • Tap into social media. Linked In. Facebook. Twitter. Instagram. Wordpress. You need to be visible on all of these computer platforms and more. Now that setting up your own website is easier than ever, do it now. In a book called “Branding: How to Use Social Media to Invent or Reinvent Yourself,” authors Erik Deckers and Kyle Lacey advise you to create an intriguing autobiography to post online. “The important part of building a personal brand is telling your story,” Deckers and Lacey write. “In fact, that’s the phrase you’ll hear over and over from personal branding and social media experts. Tell your story.” • Establish your live presence. In my view, nothing sets you up as an authority more than speaking to groups such as the Rotary or Kiwanis Clubs. Forget about getting paid for your talk. With any luck, you’ll be compensated later in sales to your listeners. If you are opening a chain of beauty salons, for instance, try to book gigs where you can demonstrate the latest hairstyles in PowerPoint slides or, better yet, on people in the audience. • Revisit marketing concepts. The steps used in personal branding require many of the same tactics as product branding. Packaging yourself. Developing a slogan. Seeking new opportunities. “Regardless of age, regardless of position, regardless of the business we happen to be in, all of us need to understand the importance of branding,” writes Tom Peters in a recent article in Fast Company magazine. “We are the CEOs of our companies. To be in business today, our most important job is to be head marketer for the brand called ‘You.’” Kathleen Begley of East Goshen owns Write Company Plus.

He’s been my colleague for the three years I’ve worked at The Atlantic, and in that time, there have been a lot of chats in our work Slack-room about video games and Soylent and Tab and typewriters and the new iPhone’s missing headphone jack. He also edits Object Lessons, a series that goes super in-depth on the history and meaning of things, like cardigans and meatballs. So it’s not surprising to those who know him that his newest book, Play Anything, is mostly about stuff, all the stuff that makes up the world, from the duct tape at Walmart with the boys of One Direction printed on it to his lawnmower. (He talks about his lawnmower a lot.) By paying attention to this stuff instead of just dismissing it, we can find meaning, he says. Rather than turning ever more and more inward, if we get out of our heads and pay attention to the abundance of stuff in the world, we learn things and make discoveries. According to Bogost, that’s what it means to play with things. (This applies to intangible things, too, like relationships or ideas.) In this way, play, he says, is a defense against irony and meaninglessness. “This demand to make something wholly from nothing, by sheer force of will,” is eating away at us, he writes. Instead, he suggests that “you accept that meaning can come from outside of you rather than from within. Perhaps, even, that it must.” I spoke with Bogost about what fun and play mean for adults, and how taking the world as it is instead of struggling against it can provide some relief. An edited and condensed transcript of our conversation is below. Julie Beck: I see now why you wanted me to be the one to interview you about this book, because you start from the premise that the universe is indifferent and life is an unending hellscape of disappointment and we have to find a way to get through it anyway! And that is 100 percent my thing. Ian Bogost: [Laughs]   Beck: You really zero in on a big problem in our culture: [The belief that] you are supposed to be able to somehow generate everything you need to be happy and content from within yourself. Bogost: It’s interesting because it’s a very secular worldview. It’s not that you’re looking to God, and it's also not that you're looking to some other source of outside meaning, and we have those sources—our families or our jobs. But the modern world is very wealthy, it's full of options. It’s not like “This is the land I was born on and I have to make the most of it, and these are the people who are near me, and so they will become my family.” We have so many choices that it's only always our fault if we’re malcontent. Beck: The answer to every dissatisfaction always seems to be to just work more on yourself, or take better care of yourself. Practice gratitude, or exercise more, or take more baths. Just change how you feel. If you’re lonely, just figure out how to enjoy being alone more! If you can’t have the things you want, just don't want those things anymore! Related Story Can This App Make Me Happier? Bogost: We’re so trained to think of life that way, that it circles around us as individuals. Our ideas of happiness, gratification, contentment, satisfaction, all demand that those feelings come from within us. If you flip that on its head and say “What if I took the world at face value?” and then ask “What can I do with what is given?” it’s an interesting trick to turn around the whole problem of how you feel. Beck: The way you define “fun” and “play” in the book aren’t the ways that most people would define them off the top of their heads. Can you explain what you mean by them? Bogost: I think the most important way to understand play is that it's this property that's in things. Like there’s play in a mechanism. For example, there’s some play in the steering column before it engages as you're turning the wheel. Beck: Play as a noun rather than a verb? Bogost: That's an interesting way of thinking about it. Play is this process of operating the world, of manipulating things. It's related to experimentation, and it's related to pleasure, but not defined by it. Normally we think of play as the opposite of work. Work is the thing you have to do, and then there's play, the thing you choose to do. But if you think of play as being in things, there are things that are playable, then it becomes the work of figuring out what a thing can do. “For me, what fun means is finding novelty in the suffocating familiarity of ordinary life.” Beck: Quick sidebar: What do you think of the phrase "Work hard, play hard?" Bogost: Any phrase that suggests play is this domain that’s the opposite of work, or the thing that you do when you're done working, should trouble us. Because it means that play is always relegated to the exhaust of life. It's the thing that you do after you do the important stuff, it's what you do on your own time. Play becomes a distraction, something you don't really need to do. It's not for serious people. They work hard, they don't play hard. Yes, you can say play hard, but that really means, keep working hard, right? Beck: It usually means drink. Bogost: Right, it means people get totally drunk and go do foolish things. I think this dichotomy or opposition between work and play, between leisure and serious stuff, is definitely a bad way of thinking about the useful insights that play provides. You can experience play at work, not because you’re messing around or wasting time or something, but because you’re looking really deeply and seriously at things and asking what is possible, what can be done with them, what new ideas might emerge? Beck: Then can you define fun? Bogost: The problem with fun is we really don’t know what fun means at all. If you stop someone who's talking about something being fun, and say “Well what do you mean?” it’s almost impossible to answer. Generally speaking, when people use the word fun, it's like a placeholder. You know, “How was your evening?” “Oh it was fun.” For me, what fun means is finding novelty in the suffocating familiarity of ordinary life. Every now and then if you try, you can discover something new. When we use this word fun, it sort of bangs up the ordinary and the extraordinary altogether. Fun has to do with habitual activities but then also terrifically novel or unusual ones. It works as a sort of strange milkshake of those concepts. When we think about play and games and the situations in which having fun is seen as an outcome, they often have to do with repetition. You're returning to something again, and even despite that similarity, you squeeze something new out of it. Beck: So can it be both novel and horrible? Can a fresh horror be fun? Bogost: Fun doesn’t have anything to do with pleasure, necessarily. I think this will be terrifically unintuitive for people. Because we're used to thinking of fun as a sort of synonym for light pleasure.  A fun movie is something that is pleasurable without being demanding, you don't have to think too hard. But if you think about the contexts in which we talk about things being fun, often there’s a certain kind of misery or effort that's involved with it. The difficulty of travel, getting all your bags packed and your work done and navigating the airports and all that. That sort of struggle. With sports and games, you have fun despite working very hard, even despite failing repeatedly. Even the fun of a night out, you have to get somewhere and do all the conversational, social work of being out. There's effort involved. But then when you're finished, you can conclude, “Actually there was something gratifying about the hardship that I just encountered.” That discovery of novelty is where the molten core of fun is. There's a whole bunch of stuff about mowing the lawn in the book. It’s an example I love because it’s the kind of thing that no one would intuitively call a fun experience, but then when you do it you discover something you haven’t seen before. Maybe this way of using my equipment will produce better results, or when the weather's like this I have to respond in that way. It's almost like, the more you’re drowning in familiarity, the better the fun is. It requires less novelty to produce even more gratification. And it's something that didn't come from you. It was about the other thing—the thing you were experiencing, or the people you were with, or the mechanism you were operating, or whatever it might be. It wasn’t you who had to come up with that meaning. It was given to you by the world. You allow yourself to discover the things that are already there when you play. Beck: A lot of times you do see articles where people are complaining that adults don’t play anymore. And it’s weird because often those arguments are like, “Remember when you used to run around your backyard and pretend to be a princess or a cowboy? Isn’t it so awful that you don't do that anymore, and you’ve lost that creativity and freedom?” But I don't want to run around and pretend to be a princess. I'm not sad that I don't do that anymore. So what does play mean for adults? I mean, some adults LARP. But other than LARPing, how do we play? Bogost: I think what you’re honing in on is that you don't want to be told, “Hey, do whatever you want.” That's what we think of when we think of play. It’s the thing where you get to do whatever you come up with in your own mind, all bets are off, there's no boundaries. But even when we tell kids to go play, what do the kids do? They come up with a set of constraints and structures. “Oh, we’re gonna build a fort out of clothes, and now that we're in the fort we're going to pretend that we're prisoners,” or whatever. The whole idea of play is in finding, acknowledging, and then working with the natural constraints and limitations that you find in the world. “The playful perspective is not meant to turn your life into a game or a jungle gym. It’s rather that the activity is looking outside of yourself.” I think the most important thing to realize about play is that it's this thing that's in stuff, it’s not in you. Play isn't you being clever, or finding a trick, or finding a way of covering over your own misery, or persuading someone to do what you want. It's the process of working with the materials that you find and discovering what's possible with them. Beck: So you do stuff and then you sit back and see what happens. Bogost: What happens and then what do you learn? Once you turn that corner it’s not even necessary to say “I’m playing,” the verb isn’t important. The playful perspective is not meant to turn your life into a game or a jungle gym. It’s rather that the activity is looking outside of yourself. Beck: You mention this in the book, how people talk about making things fun, or gamifying things, as a way to make shitty tasks less shitty. So it’s just in service of doing more work. Bogost: I definitely think that's one of the ways people have misused these notions of play and fun. We think we want enjoyment, and that enjoyment is incompatible with work, and somehow we have to import the pleasure into these miserable experiences. That takes for granted that there’s not fun or play to be found in the work itself. We have to always spread sugar on top of it in order that we can tolerate swallowing the things we’re supposed to do, which is an incredibly depressing way of thinking about living your life. Not just that your work or your home life would be so miserable that you have to slather sugar on it, but then the sugar is all you’re tasting. If that's the only way that I'm finding meaning, then we have this sort of mental diabetes that we're descending into. Beck: I listen to podcasts while I clean, or I watch Netflix while I'm folding my laundry. Am I doing it wrong? Bogost: Well, maybe, maybe not. Everyone is different. But I think that is a good example of an opportunity to stop and say, “What would it be like if I took this thing for what it is rather than trying to slather that Mary Poppins sugar on top of it?” It’s not so much that there's some sort of Protestant work ethic that dictates that you must not watch Netflix while folding your laundry, but rather that the experience of folding laundry also has its own pleasure. That might just be like “Oh I know the size and shape of these garments and I can get better at folding them into neat piles.” Or the individual packing of the dishes into the dishwasher such that they are efficiently inserted but yet not so full that they don’t clean properly. These are dumb things. They're silly things. We think they couldn’t possibly be as interesting as listening to that interview on the podcast, or watching Netflix. Until you realize that actually a lot of the supposedly serious and meaningful and worthwhile content on the podcast or on the television is no more or less meaningful than the clothes in the laundry basket or the dishes in the sink. It's more a matter of the attention you’re willing to bring to them, where you’re willing to allow meaning and pleasure and the light to escape. It’s not even that finding laundry pleasurable or delightful should be our goal rather than finding television delightful. It's that both laundry and television can be delightful. And once you get yourself on that path where you're willing to find something delightful in laundry and in dishwashers, it means that you train yourself to be able to find it almost anywhere in almost anything. And wouldn't we all rather have the possibility of finding pleasure and delight in literally anything we might encounter? Instead of assuming that actually there are only these three things where pleasure and delight are possible. Like oh, it’s television and socialization and work, and then everything else is  the smoke I have to somehow choke my way through in order to get to the good parts. Beck: Nothing is more fun than television! Bogost: I kind of agree. Beck: I get it in terms of like objects, but a lot of people’s sadness comes from more ephemeral things. They want to make more friends, or they’re dating and it sucks. How do you “play” with these intangible things? Bogost: It feels gross to talk about people with the same kinds of language that we talk about things with, but you and me and everyone, there are things about us that make us who we are, personality traits, or capacities that we have, or knowledge we possess or that we don’t possess, habits we have that are good or bad. Normally if you're dating, you’re looking for compatibility, and then the moment that there's incompatibility, you're like, “Well, swipe left on that, let’s just keep looking.” In some ways I think the same lessons apply to people that apply to objects. It’s just much easier to see that lesson in things because they're these fixed intangible lumps of stuff. People are not. They can change. My lawnmower can’t change in the way that my son can or that I can. But the idea of thinking of our relationships with people as also being structured by limitations and constraints can be useful. “This willingness to be frank and plain about the way that the world is, is a good first step. But that doesn’t mean that you get what you want.” I'll just give you one example. This is going to sound rudimentary. My wife, there's certain kinds of housework that she just doesn’t see as necessary to do in the way that I do. Things like the state of our closet or where things are in the kitchen. I have this almost unhealthily obsessive desire to have things in their place and she just totally doesn’t. And this is a potential point of conflict, of course. But there are also many things she can’t stand about me, and there are certain capacities that she has that are different than mine. The trick is to find compatibilities, and it's just much easier for me to do the chores that I can find tolerable, that bring me bizarre pleasure. Like the dishwasher, or whatever it is. It’s allowing those properties of individuals to structure your relationship with them. This produces a greater depth of understanding and empathy. There are personality traits, or baggage from their backgrounds, goals that they have and the first thing I need to do is understand and then acknowledge and then accept those properties. That's kind of the baseline requirement to have a productive relationship. I think fundamentally this honesty, this willingness to be frank and plain about the way that the world is, is a good first step. But that doesn’t mean that you get what you want. Forcing your spouse to stop doing that bad habit that drives you crazy, or making your kid be better at math or at art or at swimming, or making your parents or your in-laws not be annoying in the way that they're annoying, these are sometimes doomed goals. The question becomes not how can I change someone, or how can I change myself? But what about me doesn't change? What is true about someone else's nature? How can I work within those limits, how can I respect them, how can I understand them? Which doesn’t mean being happy about it. Then I'm not worried so much about “maybe this time will be different.” No, it won't be. Beck: It never will be. There's this quote from this Jesse Ball book, and I definitely quoted it when I interviewed Heather Havrilesky, so sorry for double dipping, but I seriously think about it all the time. It says: I believe in discovering the love that exists and then trying to understand it. Not to invent a love and try to make it exist, but to find what does exist, and then to see what it is. I think about this in terms of relationships, yes, but also in terms of trying to write a story: You try to find what exists and you try to see what it is. Even though I think about that all the time, I’m really bad at doing it. Bogost: It’s hard because we have been trained to think we have enormous power over the world. Whatever you dream, you can do. Anything can be bent to your will. But actually isn't it much more interesting to imagine that you’re quite small? Not in a powerless way, but there’s so much that is not you. There's just an enormous vast universe of possible intrigue out there and why not pay attention to it? Because then you're not burdened with trying to find that meaning in yourself all the time. Part of the reason is that the universe is not particularly concerned with you. We don’t like to think of ourselves as subject to the forces of the world, we like to think of ourselves as exerting that force. I think a lot of the misery that people experience comes from that sensation of boundlessness, of infinite possibility. We’re stuck in these situations with other people and our stuff and our jobs, and thinking that we can extract ourselves from those seems doomed to me. Instead, how can we live within those systems of constraints? We don’t have to enjoy them, exactly, but at least acknowledge that those boundaries are real and that they structure our response to the world. And then once you do that, you allow yourself to say “I did my best given the circumstances.” It releases you from the burden of thinking of all the infinity of things that you could have done or all the ways the world could be different. Beck: The thing I appreciate about this idea is that it's sort of in the middle of two weird tendencies that humans have. One is what we've been talking about this whole time, which is you just struggle so hard to try to make things happen the way you want them to and obviously that's never going to work. But then the other side of that, and this tends to be sometimes a more religious thing, is, “Oh you should just accept what is handed to you or just accept that that is the plan of the universe.” And you’re sort of saying, you can do what you can with what you have, but you're not going to change the whole world with it. Bogost: Yeah, there's some kind of happy medium here. There’s some sort of meeting point, and to me that meeting point is much closer to the world than it is to you. The actual effort that you can exert upon the universe is fairly limited. So it’s helpful to be prepared to celebrate the tiny things that you can do, where you meet the world and you negotiate an outcome that’s quite tiny. But you can still make it feel remarkable. It’s a lot like the stupid example of lawnmowing, because no one wakes up and says, “Yay I get to mow the lawn!” But if I can find meaning there, then there’s nowhere I can’t find meaning. It’s not that we’re out of control. It’s not fatalistic. It’s not something where the thing that I am meant to do will be given to me. God will not speak to me and tell me to mow my lawn today. But if you start the day not really expecting substantial change, but anticipating some small new revelation or some small alteration, then over time you’re able to find them in more places. To me, being able to find gratification in more venues, rather than greater gratification in a few, seems like a much more sane way of living. We know exactly where the path to despair and insanity lies. It's in that sense that life is meaningless, there's nothing about today that's worth doing because it's just like yesterday and it's going to be just like tomorrow. But I think for everyone, nowadays in particular, it becomes harder and harder to deal with that day-to-day, and so looking for meaning in the ordinary seems like the most urgent thing that we can do.

Twitter Email previousThe Free-Time Paradox in AmericanextHow Donald Trump Exploited Charity for Personal Gain Most Popular Presented by Mike Segar/ Reuters Donald Trump's Choice for National Security Adviser Has One Priority: Combatting 'Radical Islamic Terorrism' Krishnadev Calamur Michael Flynn is also known for his long military career and his unceremonious exit from the Defense Intelligence Agency. Michael Flynn, the retired Army lieutenant general and former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) whom Donald Trump has reportedly picked to be his national security adviser, is known for his long and distinguished military career, his unceremonious exit from the DIA, and for his controversial views on Islam, torture, and Russia. Flynn, a registered Democrat, was an early and ardent supporter of Trump’s improbable presidential run, giving the Republican presidential hopeful a much-needed endorsement from the national-security establishment. He led crowds at Trump’s rallies to chant “Lock her up” about Hillary Clinton, Trump’s Democratic opponent. “Donald Trump is about the future of this country and making sure that we take a direction … that puts us back on a track that we can continue to be the global leader around the world,” he told Fox Business Network in July. Continue Reading Bettman / Getty Progress Isn't Natural Joel Mokyr Humans invented it—and not that long ago. How and why did the modern world and its unprecedented prosperity begin? Many bookshelves are full of learned tomes by historians, economists, political philosophers and other erudite scholars with endless explanations. One way of looking at the question is by examining something basic, and arguably essential: the emergence of a belief in the usefulness of progress. Such a belief may seem self-evident today, but most people in the more-remote past believed that history moved in some kind of cycle or followed a path that was determined by higher powers. The idea that humans should and could work consciously to make the world a better place for themselves and for generations to come is by and large one that emerged in the two centuries between Christopher Columbus and Isaac Newton. Of course, just believing that progress could be brought about is not enough—one must bring it about. The modern world began when people resolved to do so.               Continue Reading Jacky Naegelen / Reuters The Problem With Abandoning the Paris Agreement Robinson Meyer Bill O’Reilly and Barack Obama agree: President-Elect Trump shouldn’t walk away from the first international climate treaty. If the Trump administration withdraws the United States from the Paris Agreement, the country would face a massive global diplomatic backlash and permanently cede worldwide leadership on climate and renewable-energy issues to China, experts warn. Withdrawing from the treaty “would be a huge mistake, even forgetting about climate change,” said Todd Stern, the former U.S. special envoy on climate change. He added that it would have “radiating bad impacts with respect to U.S. standing” on all other international issues. We know very little for sure about the Trump administration’s foreign policy. So far, he has seemed to choose Russia-friendly advisors like General Michael Flynn, and he has not backed down from previous threats of a trade war with China. If the U.S. were to renege on its NATO commitments or enter a battle of tariffs with China, this could so remake global order that climate would slide off the international agenda. Continue Reading Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP Will Trump Be Ready to Govern? Russell Berman The early days of his transition have looked like chaos, but veterans of the process say the president-elect has time to catch up. This was not exactly how the 2016 presidential transition was supposed to go. For years, legislators, civil servants, good-government advocates, and veterans of the last several administrations had been preparing for this very moment. Congress had passed two new laws allowing the two major-party nominees to begin planning earlier than ever, and the Obama administration was committed to handing off the baton of government in full stride. The singular goal was to make this transfer of presidential power the smoothest, most effective transition in U.S. history. Then came the unexpected victory of Donald Trump to blow it all to bits. The Trump transition has looked, from the outside, like a mess. Days after winning the presidency, the new president-elect abruptly replaced the man who for months had been running his transition efforts, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, with the soon-to-be vice president, Mike Pence. Other departures quickly followed in what was described as “a purge” of people close to Christie. The leadership swap caused an important paperwork snafu, delaying by several days the point when Trump’s “landing teams” of potential appointees could begin on-the-job training at federal departments and agencies. A former national-security official in Republican administrations, Eliot Cohen, emerged from a single conversation with the transition team only to warn others to stay away. One of Trump’s first appointments, chief strategist Steve Bannon, prompted a firestorm of criticism over his website’s links to white nationalism. Leaks flowed out of Trump Tower faster than transition staff could plug them, while the president-elect himself sneaked away from his press corps for an evening out at the 21 Club in Manhattan. Continue Reading Adult Swim The Battle Over Adult Swim’s Alt-Right TV Show David Sims The future of the sketch series Million Dollar Extreme Presents: World Peace has become a political flashpoint for the subversive network. At a glance, Million Dollar Extreme Presents: World Peace seems like typical fare for Adult Swim, the alternative, late-night comedy channel that airs on the Cartoon Network after 9 p.m. One of a coterie of bizarre series on the channel, the show lurches from one surreal, sometimes violent, sketch to the next, and describes itself as being set in an “almost present-day, post-apocalyptic nightmare world.” But Million Dollar Extreme, which premiered in August, is also from the mind of Sam Hyde, an unapologetic member of the alt-right. Hyde crafts his comedy with the goal of shocking his young, liberal, Millennial audience while simultaneously appealing to like-minded members of a white-nationalist movement that generally supports Donald Trump.

Alana Semuels So-called activist investors are increasingly gaining control of legacy corporations, forcing them to trim payrolls and downsize research operations—and, quite possibly, damaging the entire economy. WILMINGTON, Del.—Ron Ozer was thrilled to get a job with DuPont, the two-centuries-old chemical company, when he finished his Ph.D. from Cornell in 1990. It was the place to go for young, ambitious chemists; it offered salary and benefits so generous that some people called it “Uncle Dupey.” For 26 years, he invented things for DuPont, filing patent after patent, working on renewable plastic bottles and polymers from the company’s Experimental Station, a research lab where Kevlar, Neoprene, and nylon were all invented. Then, in January of this year, he was abruptly fired, along with hundreds of other employees at the Experimental Station, part of a company-wide wave of 1,700 layoffs, one-third of DuPont’s Delaware workforce. Globally, DuPont cut 10 percent of its workforce, or 5,000 people in early 2016. Continue Reading Oliver Munday China’s Great Leap Backward James Fallows The country has become repressive in a way that it has not been since the Cultural Revolution. What does its darkening political climate—and growing belligerence—mean for the United States? What if China is going bad? Since early last year I have been asking people inside and outside China versions of this question. By “bad” I don’t mean morally. Moral and ethical factors obviously matter in foreign policy, but I’m talking about something different. Nor is the question mainly about economics, although for China the short-term stability and long-term improvement of jobs, wages, and living standards are fundamental to the government’s survival. Under China’s single-party Communist arrangement, sustained economic failure would naturally raise questions about the system as a whole, as it did in the Soviet Union. True, modern China’s economic performance even during its slowdowns is like the Soviet Union’s during its booms. But the absence of a political outlet for dissatisfaction is similar.

The carts will be equipped with detachable motors that have sensors and video cameras. Customers will be able to request a cart using a “user interface device”, potentially a smartphone, and the roaming motors will be able to fetch a cart and bring it to a customer. The system will be able to identify an unattended shopping cart and return it to a docking station. There is no word yet on when or where Walmart intends to start using the system.

KAZINFORM The world's top ten corporations, including Apple, Shell and Walmart, have a combined revenue that is greater than the combined income of the 180 "poorest" countries out of the world's total 195 sovereign states. The figures, which reveal that Walmart, Apple and Shell alone are now richer than Russia, Belgium and Sweden, were released by the campaign group Global Justice Now. Sixty-nine of the world’s 100 top economic entities are now corporations instead of countries – a rise from last year’s staggering figure of 63. Out of the top 200 entities in the world, a whopping 153 were found to be corporations. The US, China, Germany, Japan, France and the UK comprise the top six economic entities followed by Italy, Brazil and Canada. “The vast wealth and power of corporations is at the heart of so many of the world’s problems – like inequality and climate change,” said Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now. “The drive for short-term profits today seems to trump basic human rights for millions of people on the planet. These figures show the problem is getting worse,” he added. The London-based campaign group released the figures in an effort to put increased pressure on the British government ahead of their working group with the UN. The meeting, led by Ecuador, was established with the aim of working towards a binding treaty that would ensure “transnational corporations abide by the full range of human rights responsibilities”. “The UK government has facilitated this rise in corporate power – through tax structures, trade deals and even aid programmes that help big business,” said Dearden. “Their wholehearted support for the US-EU trade deal TTIP, is just the latest example of government help to big business. Disgracefully it also routinely opposes the call of developing countries to hold corporations to account for their human rights impacts at the UN.”  Source: RT  Keywords: World News, : Read also Educational robot attacks man in China Terminally ill teen won historic ruling to preserve body 3 dead bodies found in central Japan home Man set himself on fire in Australia Black gold: Newly discovered Texas Oil Field could hold 20 bln barrels Mosul Iraq battle: Bad weather slows advance inside city News from dashboard.idealmedia.com Send Latest news Caspian countries to create common chart atlas of region’s geological content 20:30 Regions > Mangystau region 17 Educational robot attacks man in China 19:16 World News > World News 82 Tokayev met Ambassadors of Israel and Japan 18:16 Authorities and Policy > Parliament 94 India keen on trade development with EEU 17:29 Authorities and Policy > Integration 84 RoK Ombudsman told about Kazakhstan’s achievements in prevention of tortures in Geneva 17:04 World News > International Activity of Kazakhstan 96 -40°C frost to hit some regions at weekend 16:58 Regions > Regions 95 Regional Mass Media Alliance may be established in Kazakhstan 16:32 Regions > Regions 105 Improvement of ambulance service discussed in South Kazakhstan 16:06 Regions > South Kazakhstan region 104 KASE day session: USDKZT_TOD = 340.92 16:04 Economy and finance > Economy 97 Brazil to participate in 2017 Almaty Winter Universiade 15:57 Sport > 2017 Winter Universiade 96 Education Ministry to raise up to $100 M for scientific projects 15:34 Society > Education and Science 103 Terminally ill teen won historic ruling to preserve body 15:03 World News > World News 105 OANA General Assembly kicks off in Baku 14:43 Authorities and Policy > Integration 96 Kazakhstan, Singapore enjoy trust-based dialogue: Bilahari Kausikan 14:23 Regions > Astana 105 Halyk Bank comments on rumors about its merger with KKB 14:16 Economy and finance > Economy 106 Finland's Commissioner denies negative comments about EXPO pavilion collapse 13:59 Regions > Astana 129 3 dead bodies found in central Japan home 13:47 World News > World News 118 Man set himself on fire in Australia 13:20 World News > World News 114 Local content share in public procurements reached 58.3% in 2016 12:57 Economy and finance > Economy 98 Olympic champions join charity campaign for little Kazakhstanis 12:42 Regions > Astana 106 Kazakhstan ranks 94th in Global Terrorism Index 2016 12:24 130 Regional mass media can contribute to Kazakhstan's modernization - Abayev 12:12 Regions > Astana 102 Kazakhstan and Canada to intensify inter-parliamentary coop 11:56 World News > International Activity of Kazakhstan 120 OIC elects new Sec Gen 11:43 Authorities and Policy > Integration 123 KASE morning session: USDKZT_TOD = 341.33 (+0.11) 11:23 Economy and finance > Economy 110 New Vice Minister of Defense and Aerospace Industry appointed 11:06 Authorities and Policy > Government 108 American business interested in EEU 10:43 Authorities and Policy > Eurasian Economic Union 56 Flights delayed at airports in Astana, Almaty 10:19 Regions > Almaty 110 Load more Commented articles UNESCO heritage was discussed in Kyzylorda Regions > Kyzylorda region 0 Mazhilis and EU representatives discuss interpaliamentary partnership Authorities and Policy > Parliament 0 Portugal investor to build apartment house in Ayagoz, East Kazakhstan State programs and projects > Housing Construction Development 0 Gusty wind, black ice forecast for most regions of Kazakhstan Regions > Regions 0 Nazarbayev, Putin discuss situation in Syria World News > International Activity of Kazakhstan 0 Kazakhstan announces inflation forecast for 2017-2018 Economy and finance > Economy 0 Almaty to welcome November Music Fest international festival Regions > Almaty 0 Archive 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 January February March April May June July August September October November December 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 Terms of Use Vacancies Photo website About Kazinform Our partners Contacts State symbols Advertisement © 2016 Kazinform

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. NEW YORK (CNNMoney) Walmart is planning to eventually have self-driving shopping carts roaming its stores and herding themselves out of the parking lot. The U.S. government granted Walmart a patent last week that indicates the company is planning to roll out a system that allows shopping carts to drive themselves. According to the patent request, the carts will be equipped with detachable motors that have sensors and video cameras. Customers will be able to request a cart using a "user interface device" -- potentially a smartphone -- and the roaming motors will be able to fetch a cart and bring it to a customer. And employees who are usually in charge of rounding up abandoned carts may be able to abandon that task. The system will, in theory, be able to identify an unattended shopping cart in a store or parking lot and return it to a docking station, according to the filing. The system may help the stores manage inventory. One portion of the filing describes a scenario in which the system receives a request for an item, searches an inventory database, then sends the motorized unit to a store shelf to ensure the product is there. There's no word yet on when or where Walmart intends to start using the system. A Walmart spokesperson was not able to immediately provide additional information.

SHARE Blotter, September 13, 2016 By Staff Monday, September 12, 2016 Accused flasher has history A 37-year-old man accused of flashing his Strive case manager was arrested Thursday and could be charged with felony indecent exposure. Joshua Dean Crum, who has a history of indecent exposure and public masturbation, was reportedly meeting the woman Thursday afternoon about some paperwork he needed to sign for the organization, according to an arrest warrant. The case manager reported that when she put the paper on her desk, Crum stepped forward, and she realized he was exposing himself, according to the report. The woman said she told him to get out, but said Crum had followed her back to her personal vehicle at one point, the report said. When contacted by Grand Junction police officers, Crum reportedly said he had “just forgot to put it away after he had gone to the bathroom,” the report said. Crum was issued a $2,000 cash bond Monday in county court.   Police tase suspect twice   A man who was twice hit with a Taser after allegedly taking a swing at a police officer’s face early Monday morning in the Walmart parking lot on North Avenue is being held in the Mesa County Jail in lieu of a $5,000 cash bond. Vince Joe Pacheco, 24, could be charged with felony counts of second-degree assault on a police officer and criminal attempt, as well as misdemeanor counts of obstructing a peace officer and third-degree criminal trespass. Officers wrote in an arrest affidavit that they saw Pacheco acting suspiciously around Walmart at about 3 a.m. Monday and he seemed to be trying to avoid them, so they addressed him. “I asked Pacheco how he was doing and he stated ‘I don’t have to talk to you,’ ” the report said. Officers told Pacheco to stop, and he said no several times before he “turned around, balled his right fist and swung at me attempting to punch me in the face,” the report said. The officer drew his weapon and chased Pacheco, eventually using his Taser twice, according to the affidavit. “Pacheco then began flopping on the ground having a ‘seizure’ as he claimed even though he was still yelling at me for Tasing him for no reason while having this seizure,” the report said. Pacheco was transported to the jail.   According to the Grand Junction Police Department: ■ Scott Gill, 30, was cited on suspicion of driving under the influence and other offenses Wednesday. ■ Travis Koncher, 27, was cited on suspicion of driving under the influence and careless driving Thursday. ■ Mitchell Wintrow, 26, is accused of theft Friday. ■ Blake Curtis, 26, Samuel Wentling, 29, and John Bigger, 31, were each cited on suspicion of disorderly conduct Saturday. ■ Someone stole a vehicle worth less than $100,000 and a handgun worth less than $2,000 from the 2800 block of Brittany Drive on Saturday. ■ Someone stole property worth between $200 and $300 from a vehicle in the 800 block of Noland Avenue on Sept. 3. ■ Matthew Barnard, 31, is accused of trespassing in vehicles, damaging them and stealing items at Action Rent A Car on Sept. 3. ■ Brett Spenneberg, 37, is accused of criminal impersonation on Sept. 5. ■ Someone stole property worth less than $2,000 from a trailer near Rio Grande Drive and Cumbres Court on Sept. 2. ■ Someone stole items from a garage in the 1700 block of North 26th Street on Sept. 5. ■ Someone cut a trailer padlock and stole tools and supplies worth less than $5,000 from a parking lot in the 500 block of 30 Road on Sept. 1. ■ Someone entered a refrigerated product dispensing machine and stole products worth between $300 and $750 on Wednesday. ■ Someone stole a vehicle worth less than $5,000 from the 1600 block of North 23rd Street on Thursday. ■ Someone stole a vehicle worth more than $20,000 from the 500 block of Redwing Lane on Friday. ■ Someone stole property worth less than $2,000 from vehicles in the 600 block of Little Rose Avenue on Thursday. ■ Someone broke a window and stole items worth less than $300 from a vehicle in the 2800 block of Hermosa Court on Thursday.   According to the Mesa County Sheriff’s Office: ■ Deputies responded to a criminal mischief report in the 4000 block of Horse Canyon Road on Aug. 12. ■ Deputies responded to a criminal mischief report in the 9000 block of Colorado Highway 65 on Aug. 26. ■ Alta Lamphier, 41, was cited on suspicion of disorderly conduct Sept. 2. ■ Deputies responded to a theft of a firearm in the 3100 block of 32 1/2 Road on Sept. 6. ■ Deputies took a report of a theft in the 3000 block of the Interstate 70 Business Loop on Sept. 1. ■ Deputies responded to a reported theft in the 500 block of 32 Road on Thursday. ■ Roger Knuckles, 32, is accused of possession of a controlled substance, a protection order violation, a bail-bond violation and traffic offenses Saturday.   According to the Montrose County Sheriff’s Office: ■ Brandon J.

Kirk & Associates. This landscape plan shows the proposed layout for 35 residential lots Parrish Building Co. wants to create near the corner of Tyler Road and Alford Avenue. × 2 of 2 Expand Map provided by city of Hoover Ross Bridge townhome site plan 8-22-16 Signatures Homes wants to add 40 townhouses in the Ross Bridge Village Center. Prev Next A request to rezone property along Alford Avenue in Bluff Park tonight received approval from the Hoover Planning and Zoning Commission. The request was submitted to rezone two parcels, totaling 8.96 acres, from an agricultural district to a Planned Residential Development district in order to accommodate 35 single-family homes. Joey Miller, a civil engineer representing the property owner, said the lots would be 75 feet wide and homes would be between 2,500 and 2,800 square feet, almost double the city’s required minimum size of 1,500 square feet for that zoning classification. Two years ago, the property owners proposed a plan to put a Walmart Neighborhood Market on the property in question, which is located near the corner of Alford Avenue and Tyler Road. However, they later withdrew the request after much opposition from the community. The land is surrounded by Bluff Park United Methodist Church and St. Luke Korean Catholic Church, estate zoning, townhomes, agricultural zoning and the Bluff Park Village shopping center. Miller said the single-family houses around Bluff Park Village and the townhomes across the street are both denser than the proposed development. “There are some single-family, large residential lots that are kind of caddy-corner across the street, but it’s kind of a mixed area right there,” he said. “To me this is a very good transitional zoning because we’re backing up to the church and to a commercial shopping center, so to me it’s a good use of the property.” Hoover resident Steve Ledger, who lives off of Shades Crest Road near the development, told the commission he believes the proposed development was too dense for what he described as a “mature, historic neighborhood.” The development could put a further strain on resources, including Bluff Park Elementary and the single-lane ingress and egress roads in that residential area, Ledger said. Miller previously said the proposed development is expected to generate 140 vehicle trips per day. Allowing a dense development could set a poor precedent for infill development, Ledger added. “If Hoover Country Club, of which I’m a member, were to go bankrupt, as many golf clubs are doing these days such as Altadena, how would we look at the development there? If we took this precedent, can we imagine how many home sites would be built there?,” Ledger said. Sid Lassiter, a resident of the Tyler Crest Townhomes across the street from the proposed development, said while they did not oppose the development, he and other residents had concerns. Their main concerns included stormwater runoff and maintaining a “reasonably safe” access to the townhomes, Lassiter said. A gully behind the townhomes fills in current storms, he said, and residents worry it will overflow with excess runoff. Lassiter added, however, that the developer said they would help clean out the gully to prevent it overflowing. Miller said there would also be a retention pond at the new development to prevent excess runoff to other properties. Because many people were upset at the proposed Walmart development, Lassiter said he saw the proposed subdivision as the best alternative for the land. In regard to density issues, Lassiter said the area was already dense, and the subdivision would not change that. “It is what it is already, is what I’m trying to say,” he said. “The die has already been cast.” The planning commission unanimously approved the rezoning request, and it now goes to the Hoover City Council for consideration. Also at the meeting, the commission: Approved a request to add 108 acres to the Blackridge development at the end of Stadium Trace Parkway. The addition of land would not increase the number of homes in the development, Signature Homes Jonathan Belcher said. Hoover Executive Director Allen Pate said it seemed like a “no-brainer” to approve the addition because it would not add any homes, but rather spread the planned 1,150 homes over more land. Approved a request to allow 40 townhomes and a park across the street from the Ross Bridge Welcome Center in what Belcher said residents know as the “gravel lot.” Belcher said that during a meeting with residents, most seemed to believe the development would be OK. In conjunction with the townhomes, Signature Homes has agreed not to build any more multi-family dwellings in Ross Bridge. Previous agreements allowed for up to 110 more multi-family units, but those would be off the table with approval of the townhomes. Commissioner John Lyda said it was good to take the multi-family units off the table, and Zoning commission Chairman Mike Wood commended Belcher for "getting rid of the apartments.” Sent a request for a car wash and detailing company off of Alabama 119 and Tattersall Drive near Greystone to the City Council without a recommendation. The request was submitted by Warren Bailey, representing Blue Rain Express Car Wash. A motion was made to deny the request, with three votes in favor of the motion and three against. The request will go on to the Hoover City Council presented as a tie vote. Community members who spoke in opposition of the car wash included a Greystone resident who said she and neighbors were “not ecstatic” about having a car wash backing up to their property and a man who said he received approval to build a car wash across the street in unincorporated Shelby County. Approved a request from Jim and Lynn Estes to combine two lots into one in the Park Lane addition to Riverchase. Approved a request from Tameron Honda to combine four lots on property along Sierra Drive into one lot. Approved the resurvey of several lots in phase five of the Northampton portion of Ross Bridge. Approved a request to reconfigure several lots in the commercial sector of Ross Bridge. Delayed consideration of a request to divide one lot in the second sector of International Park into two lots until the Oct. 10 Hoover Planning and Zoning Commission meeting. The resurvey would create ingress/egress utility and drainage easements for a road that Vestavia Hills wants to build to a new city park being developed on the former Altadena Valley Country Club property off Acton Road.

The figures, which reveal that Walmart, Apple and Shell alone are now richer than Russia, Belgium and Sweden, were released by the campaign group Global Justice Now. Sixty-nine of the world’s 100 top economic entities are now corporations instead of countries – a rise from last year’s staggering figure of 63. Out of the top 200 entities in the world, a whopping 153 were found to be corporations. Read more ‘Time to pull secret trade deal TTIP out of the shadows’ The US, China, Germany, Japan, France and the UK comprise the top six economic entities followed by Italy, Brazil and Canada. “The vast wealth and power of corporations is at the heart of so many of the world’s problems – like inequality and climate change,” said Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now. “The drive for short-term profits today seems to trump basic human rights for millions of people on the planet. These figures show the problem is getting worse,” he added. The London-based campaign group released the figures in an effort to put increased pressure on the British government ahead of their working group with the UN. The meeting, led by Ecuador, was established with the aim of working towards a binding treaty that would ensure “transnational corporations abide by the full range of human rights responsibilities”. “The UK government has facilitated this rise in corporate power – through tax structures, trade deals and even aid programmes that help big business,” said Dearden.

(Amanda Yeager / BSMG) Anne Arundel County Executive Steve Schuh talks about a $200,000 grant awarded to the Anne Arundel Workforce Development Corporation that is aimed at attracting and retaining retail workers. (Amanda Yeager / BSMG) Amanda YeagerContact Reporterayeager@capgaznews.com New grant aims to convince Anne Arundel County workers that retail jobs aren't "dead end" jobs Anne Arundel County's Workforce Development Corporation has been awarded $200,000 as part of a nationwide initiative focused on attracting and retaining retail industry employees. County Executive Steve Schuh and AAWDC President and CEO Kirkland Murray announced the two-year grant Monday at Arundel Mills mall in Hanover. The corporation — a nonprofit that provides job training services to county residents and hiring advice to local businesses — was one of 10 organizations across the country to receive the money, which is part of a $10.9 million grant funded by the Walmart Foundation. Murray said the corporation will use grant money to educate people about job opportunities in retail, to ensure prospective workers have the skills employers are looking for and to give current retail employees the training they need to move up the career ladder. AAWDC will soon launch a marketing campaign highlighting retail opportunities. "The ultimate goal here is to see people stay in retail and help people look at retail as a viable career path," Murray said. Anne Arundel's retail sector encompasses 34,172 employees working for 1,969 businesses, according to statistics from AAWDC. The industry is expected to grow by about 1,000 jobs between now and 2020. Grant recipient By Amanda Yeager, Staff Anne Arundel County's Workforce Development Corporation is the recipient of a $200,000 grant from the Walmart Foundation aimed at attracting and retaining retail industry employees. Anne Arundel County's Workforce Development Corporation is the recipient of a $200,000 grant from the Walmart Foundation aimed at attracting and retaining retail industry employees. (By Amanda Yeager, Staff) Nationally, retail supports one in four American jobs and has a $2.6 trillion impact on the gross domestic product, per the National Retail Federation, an industry group. While possibilities for career advancement are available, retailers say they can't always find employees with the skills to take on higher-level positions, according to a presentation from the Chicago Cook Workforce Partnership, the organization managing the retail grant initiative for Walmart. A number of factors can make retail appear undesirable to prospective employees, according to the presentation, including low starting wages, a lack of clear opportunities for growth, jobs that hire only seasonal or temporary workers and the perception that retail jobs are "dead end" positions.

The grant is aimed at attracting and retaining retail industry employees. (By Amanda Yeager, Staff) "A lot of people start in retail but do not finish in it — it's a high school job, it's a right-out-of-college job," Murray said. "Employers are saying the main thing that they want are people that have customer service skills, people that have an outgoing personality and people that can do math. So we want to make sure we're giving people those skills." Results from the initiative will contribute to a collection of "best practices" that other workforce development organizations can replicate, said Walmart market manager Charita Mariner. She said the retail and grocery mega-chain and its charitable arm, the Walmart Foundation, have committed to investing $100 million in economic mobility over the course of five years. Schuh called the grant a "great example of the public sector working in partnership with the private sector to solve a problem and to advance our economy, and to help people." "The work that we're conducting here as part of this program is going to be a national model for the entire country about how to help people get the skills they need and to integrate back into the workforce," he said.

Walmart Will Add A State Fair-Themed Restaurant To Texas Store Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Walmart Will Add A State Fair-Themed Restaurant To Texas Store Image courtesy of Robert Hensley September 12, 2016 5:16 pm EST By Laura Northrup@lnorthrup food terrible food food glorious food FOOD FRIED FOOD fried food STATE FAIR OF TEXAS STATE FAIR TREATS Do you like state fair food? You know, the deep-fried creations made from food that should never have been fried, like deep-fried butter, spaghetti ice cream, or a deep-fried burger with grilled cheese sandwiches for buns? Soon you’ll only have your conscience to keep you from eating that stuff year-round, as Walmart tests a possible nationwide concept with the State Fair Cafe at its store in Plano, TX. Yes, you might even be able to get deep-fried Twinkies in the off-season somewhere other than the freezer aisle at Walmart. The restaurant concept comes from Isaac Rousso, an award-winning food experimenter at the state fair in Texas. He and his family run multiple food stands at the fair, and this year he won a prize for his booth’s cookie fries, which are apparently a thing. The restaurant where it will be the state fair year-round will open in a Walmart store in Plano, TX next week. Walmart has ambitions to take the idea regional and maybe even national: is there anywhere in the country where people don’t like fair food? Part of the appeal of eating ridiculous food at a fair is the fair itself: you know that you can’t eat the ridiculous food items every day because you don’t have access to them. What happens if the chain’s plans to take this idea nationwide really happen, and you do have access to them daily?

"As multinationals increasingly dominate areas traditionally considered the primary domain of the state, we should be afraid." —Aisha Dodwell, Global Justice Now The economic and social justice advocacy group discovered (spreadsheet) that the ten largest corporations are wealthier than most countries in the world combined. "Today, of the 100 wealthiest economic entities in the world, 69 are now corporations and only 31 countries," wrote Global Justice Now campaigns and policy officer Aisha Dodwell. "This is up from 63 to 37 a year ago. At this rate, within a generation we will be living in a world entirely dominated by giant corporations." Indeed, multinational behemoths Shell, Apple, and Walmart each rake in more revenue than the world's 180 "poorest" countries—a list that includes Ireland, Greece, Israel, South Africa, Vietnam, and Colombia—combined. And the top ten largest companies have a whopping combined value of $2.9 trillion, which is larger than China's economy. "The drive for short-term profits today seems to trump basic human rights for millions of people on the planet." —Nick Dearden, Global Justice Now Walmart, the biggest corporate entity in the world, is valued at over $482 billion, which makes it wealthier than Spain, Australia, and the Netherlands, individually. "The vast wealth and power of corporations is at the heart of so many of the world's problems—like inequality and climate change," said Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now. "The drive for short-term profits today seems to trump basic human rights for millions of people on the planet. These figures show the problem is getting worse." "As multinationals increasingly dominate areas traditionally considered the primary domain of the state, we should be afraid," Dodwell continued: While they privatize everything from education and health to border controls and prisons, they stash their profits away in secret offshore accounts. And while they have unrivaled access to decision makers they avoid democratic processes by setting up secret courts enabling them to bypass all judicial systems applicable to people. Meanwhile their raison d'etre of perpetual growth in a finite world is causing environmental destruction and driving climate change. From Sports Direct's slave-like working conditions to BP's oil spill devastating people’s homes, stories of corporations violating rights are all too often seen in our daily papers.     Global Justice Now noted that it "released the figures in order to increase pressure on the British government ahead of a UN working group, led by Ecuador, established to draw up a binding treaty to ensure transnational corporations abide by the full range of human rights responsibilities. Campaigners are calling for the treaty to be legally enforceable at a national and global level." "Britain doesn’t support the process, and has repeatedly vetoed and opposed such proposal in the past," the group added. "The U.K. government has facilitated this rise in corporate power," Dearden said, "through tax structures, trade deals, and even aid programs that help big business. Their wholehearted support for the U.S.-EU trade deal TTIP is just the latest example of government help to big business. Disgracefully it also routinely opposes the call of developing countries to hold corporations to account for their human rights impacts at the UN." "We must fight back." —Aisha DodwellAlongside the latest figures demonstrating the extent to which corporations dominate the world, Global Justice Now released a petition calling on the British government to support a binding UN treaty that would force corporations to respect human rights around the world. The treaty will be delivered to U.K. and European Union leaders in Geneva on October 12, the group says. "Of course, the battle against corporate power has many fronts and the UN treaty is only one part of it," Dodwell observed. "At the same time, we need to continue to develop alternative ways to produce and distribute the goods and services we need. We need to undermine the notion that only massive corporations can make the economy and society 'work.'" "The alternative is that we continue to rush towards the dystopian vision of unchallenged corporate power," Dodwell wrote. "We cannot allow this to happen. We must fight back."

It found 73 percent of marketers use inbound marketing as their primary strategy. HubSpot surveyed 4,500 global marketers and salespeople from 132 countries. While it didn't specifically ask its customers to identify themselves, a HubSpot spokesperson said it's “safe to assume some that a portion of the respondents are HubSpot customers.” HubSpot is, as you might expect from the products it offers, pretty enthusiastic about inbound marketing. Some call the company's founders, Brian Halligan and Dharmesh Shah, the pioneers of inbound marketing. And HubSpot's Inbound conference is massive, drawing 14,000 to Boston last year with more expected at next conference this November.   Inbound All the Way? But is inbound all the rage like the HubSpot report says it is? The key to understanding this statistic is in the size of the organizations that responded to HubSpot’s survey, according to Jake DiMare, director of marketing for New York City-based advisory firm Digital Clarity Group and a CMSWire Reader Advisory Board member.  About 45 percent of the respondents have 10 or less employees. Only 8 percent were larger than 1,000 employees and only 3 percent are billion-dollar-plus earners.  “If you asked senior marketers at consumer brands in the Fortune 500 their response would be, 'Sure, inbound has a role, but it’s obvious where our marketing spend is going,'" DiMare said. Walmart, currently No. 1 on the Fortune 500, spent $2.09 billion on advertising alone in 2015. "On the other hand," DiMare said, "if Walmart has an inbound strategy, it’s invisible." DiMare said larger enterprises spend more on things like advertising, channel partnerships and product placement. Smart, Creative Marketers Win HubSpot CMO Kipp Bodnar maintains inbound marketing can work for any organization, although he conceded "it is especially attractive to smaller companies, with smaller budgets, that are looking to make and impact and compete against larger competitors with more money.”  “One of the beautiful things about inbound is that it isn't about how much money you spend on marketing, it's about how smart and creative you are in the content that you create and how effectively you provide value to your customers,” he added. Bodnar defined inbound marketing as the “full process of taking potential customers, turning them into visitors to your site, then leads, prospects and ultimately happy customers.” Cold calls, email batch-and-blasts banner ads and pop-up ads represent the outbound side of the marketing aisle. “Content marketing is a piece of the larger inbound marketing puzzle,” he told CMSWire. “but it's not the whole thing. "Content is a key part of the process but it works along side social media, search engine optimization, email marketing and other inbound channels. Sure content is a part of each of these but so is the campaign and distribution elements to make sure that the content is seen by your target audience.” HubSpot report authors go on to boast about particular findings in today's report, citing the 81 percent of inbound organizations feel that their marketing strategy is effective, making inbound organizations four times as likely to rate their marketing strategy highly, compared to outbound organizations. [Updated for 2016] How to: Land a Speaking Gig at the Event of Your Dreams https://t.co/FFthgvOzYV #INBOUND16 pic.twitter.com/ATlBgvpoNs — INBOUND (@INBOUND) April 26, 2016 HubSpot Uses Broad Definition of Inbound The large number of marketers classifying inbound as their primary strategy in this year’s HubSpot report may have to do with the term itself being “very broad,” according to Benjamin Smidt, founder of Focused Excellence and a digital marketing specialist. “Inbound, as defined by HubSpot, is very broad,” Smidt told CMSWire. “This could in part be why 73 percent are claiming to be leveraging inbound marketing. The definition of inbound has evolved over time and as a result the value placed on that term, in my opinion, has degraded. According to HubSpot, inbound now appears to focus most strongly on brand loyalty, which can be difficult to convert into sales and as a result may be why we see some mixed data responses in the report.”  Claiming nearly three out of four marketers are leveraging inbound marketing illustrates potential market saturation and that inbound has become a global trend, Smidt said. “I don’t disagree with this conclusion,” he said, “however I believe inbound needs to be defined more granular to truly understand what is working for these surveyed marketers who claim to be utilizing these techniques within the report.” Leads, Conversions Still Rule Call it inbound or outbound, marketing is still marketing, and marketers want quality leads that convert into customers who buy things from their organizations. Marketers reported in this year’s survey they still see quality leads that convert to customers as the top priority as they did in the last three reports. “Converting contacts/leads to customers” ranked No. 1 this year, ahead of “grow traffic to website," “increasing revenue derived from existing customers” and “proving the ROI of our marketing activities.” Increasing and converting leads ranked in the top two in the last three HubSpot reports, outside of 2013, when “reaching relevant audience” snuck in as the No. 1 priority. Asked what he sees in terms of marketers priorities, DiMare called growth, conversion and revenue “table stakes.”  “I spent three days with senior marketers from some of the largest, most recognized brands in the world at CMO Digital US in San Diego last week,” DiMare told CMSWire. “Most of the conversations we had were about mobile, proximity marketing, experiential and wrestling with big data.” What’s Behind Priorities? It’s not always true that converting leads should be a marketers’ top priority. Ann Breckenkamp, vice president of marketing and operations at San Francisco-based Giftly and a CMSWire Reader Advisory Board member, said the survey respondents seem to hail from businesses at different stages of maturity with different types of products or services.   “It's hard for me to say that ‘converting contacts/leads into customers’ or ‘growing traffic to website’ is where priorities should or shouldn't be without knowing more about a specific organization's operation,” Breckenkamp said. “For example, these are not things you would want to prioritize just yet if you have a retention problem or if you aren't able to measure the impact of your sales/marketing activities.” Inbound, she added, can be a “very effective strategy.”  “But,” she added, “unless you're able to quantitatively measure conversion associated with each of your inbound marketing activities, you could be wasting a lot of resources without realizing it.” Marketers’ priorities have shifted as a consequence of the effectiveness of previous years’ strategies, according to Courtney Beasley, director of marketing at Chicago-based public relations firm Walker Sands. “Instead of focusing on filling the funnel, marketers are now trying to figure out how to work with the leads they have,” Beasley told CMSWire. “This tells me two things: One, marketers now have to learn how to create more mid- to lower-funnel content to continue the conversation they started and two, budgets will be spent in different ways that the last two to three years.”  Title image "DSC_0069" (CC BY-SA 2.0) by jameskm03 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Think of Microsoft’s New Outlook Customer Manager as Salesforce Light Tableau Shifts from Visual Analytics to 'Complete Data Play' Gartner Rates 4 ECM Vendors Leaders, Drops 3 Others to Challengers Hubspot Unveils GrowthBot, a Chatbot for Sales & Marketing Digital Customer Experience Is a Business Priority, CMSWire Survey Says Hacking Marketing: Out With the Old, In With the New Marketing Management Evergage Guardian Uses Machine Learning, AI to Pull Deeper Insight From Data 1 in 4 Micro Businesses Are Missing Big Marketing Opportunities This Small Business Saturday, It's All About Location Adobe to Acquire TubeMogul for $540M Useful Article?

Published Sep 12th, 2016 11:02 am ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas It is no secret that Wal-Mart’s pending acquisition of Jet.com in the U.S. and recent partnership with JD.com in China are strategic plays the retail giant hopes will help its own e-commerce brand in the future. Wal-Mart Stores Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs recently told analysts that the moves are part of the retailer’s growth plans in the changing retail dynamic. Biggs was one of the featured speakers at the Goldman Sachs Global Retail Conference held in New York. “Jet on its own is an exciting brand, it’s grown very quickly and what they do with their smart cart technology is really interesting and unique in the way they have a customer build a basket. So having that unique brand like Jet is great for us,” Biggs said. He added that Wal-Mart is excited about the differences in the two brands and how leveraging one against the other is likely to improve Walmart.com and Jet.com. “I had a chance to meet with the Jet team yesterday … Marc Lore and his team have astute knowledge in this industry which is a big benefit,” Biggs said. Biggs said Walmart.com has build at good foundation under Neil Ashe’s leadership, but now Lore can bring his team and their unique insight sharing information back and forth between the two brands. Wal-Mart Stores Chief Financial Officer Brett Biggs After investing heavily in e-commerce infrastructure over the past two years, Biggs said investors began to see some of the fruits in the recent quarter reported Aug. 18. There was an acceleration in Gross Market Value growth by 13%, in part because of the retailer’s push to add marketplace or third party suppliers. With respect to the marketplace push, Biggs said Wal-Mart wants to be there for the customer with first party, third party or any other way they want to shop. When asked if the two brands – Jet and Walmart.com – would co-exist long term or if one would be folded into the other, Biggs said Wal-Mart has experience running multiple brands. In the U.S. there is Neighborhood Market and Supercenters and globally there are many multiple brands that allow Walmart to reach customers in different ways. “Having two brands in e-commerce will allow us to try new things, lever each brand and take strengths from both. Jet also serves a more urban customer which is a benefit,” Biggs added. When asked about the $3.3 billion paid for Jet.com, Biggs said the capital allocation is a way Wal-Mart can reinvest back into the business to enhance shareholder return. Wal-Mart has to ensure it has a healthy business long term, while understanding that shorter and mid-term results are also watched closely by investors, he said. Somewhat overshadowed in recent weeks is the JD.Com partnership which analysts say is a big deal for Walmart’s growth in China. Biggs said the JD.com deal made a lot of sense when considering that Yihoadian’s reach in China was limited. He said the Yihaodian business was good but China’s landscape is huge and partnering with the No. 2 player in that country looked to be the best way to grow internet sales in China. Analysts applaud the recent moves by Wal-Mart to try grow its ecommerce business. Veteran retail analyst Walter Loeb of Loeb & Associates noted in a recent blog post that the Jet.com and JD partnership provide Wal-Mart with opportunities to become more competitive with giants like Amazon and Alibaba. Loeb said Walmart will be in a more competitive position with opportunities to take market share which is what management is aiming to do. In so doing, Loeb said, it’s the customer who will be the biggest winner, but likely not so great for the retail sector overall. “Many will be hurt, when elephants fight, the ants get stomped on,” Loeb said.

Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now A strategy successfully used by some big box stores to cut local property taxes paid in Michigan and other states is now being tried in Texas.   In at least four counties in Texas, the Lowe’s home improvement chain has challenged its tax bill, saying its property should be valued as if the buildings sat empty.   Only the stores, which are in Bexar, Harris, Hunt and Taylor counties, remain open. The so-called dark-store strategy was coined for the industry term that describes a store that’s been vacated. Retailers who use the argument to protest their property values say if the business leaves, the empty building would be hard to fill. So far, North Texas counties haven’t seen  the strategy used by big boxes, but they worry it could be spreading.  And they say if large stores are granted big reductions, the tax burden will fall increasingly on homeowners. Plano-based At Home has converted several big box stores across the U.S. as it expands into new cities. Earlier this year it opened stores in a vacated Kohl's in Plano and an empty Wal-Mart in Farmers Branch. (Brian Carlson) Highest and best use Texas counties have always valued stores based on their “highest and best use” at the beginning of each year. But the dark-store strategy seeks to change that. A lawsuit pending in Harris County District Court in Houston filed by North Carolina-based Lowe’s Cos. against the Harris County Appraisal District is being closely watched by the rest of the state’s county appraisal districts. The lawsuit lists five stores that Lowe’s is attempting to have property values reduced. Lowe’s has a separate action pending in San Antonio using the dark-store argument, but it’s not as far along. It’s still in arbitration, said Bexar County deputy chief appraiser Mary Kieki. Lowe’s is challenging assigned property values of 10 open stores in the county for each of the last three years.  The stores are currently valued at $82 a square foot. Lowe’s asked to reduce the valuation to $20 a square foot, she said. “This could be enormous,” Kieki said. “It wouldn’t stop with the big boxes like Sam’s, Lowe’s and Home Depot. You could see it continue with Kohl’s and CVS. Where does it stop?”   Heated topic Texas is Lowe’s largest state with 141 stores. It’s also the largest state for Wal-Mart which has 600 stores here. Wal-Mart declined to comment on the dark-store strategy. A Target spokeswoman said the retailer had nothing to share on the topic. Big box retailers say a store’s market value should be set at the sale price of a similar size building that’s vacant. Retailers argue the large buildings, often well over 100,000 square feet, would be difficult to sell if empty, plus deed restrictions limit future uses.    Appraisers say that’s an argument to make if a store is closed and the building stays empty without hopes of a new tenant coming in, but even then appraisers say that’s not a solid argument. “A closed store would be a case-by-case property issue,” said Collin County chief appraiser Bo Daffin. “It’s not a way to look at a category of all big box stores.” No retailer has presented Collin County with the dark-store strategy yet, Daffin said, but it’s making its way through Texas.   “It’s a very heated topic,” Daffin said. “We’re not immune to this. It could come to Collin County if it’s in Bexar and Harris counties.” If an appraisal is wrong there’s a system to protest it, he said, but changing the way appraisals are calculated using a dark-store strategy is not the way Texas does it.

(Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News) Limited litigation funds  The Dallas County Appraisal District doesn’t have any dark-store issues, said Cheryl Jordan, a spokeswoman for the district.   Nearby Hunt County settled with Lowe’s over the 2014 valuation of a Lowe’s store in Greenville. “They used the dark-store strategy, but we didn’t go to trial,” said Brent South, Hunt County’s chief appraiser. The legal costs associated with taking the case to court would have been too high for a county with an annual litigation budget of $50,000, he said. “We didn’t have the resources to go to trial.” Hunt County settled for a valuation that reduced Lowe’s property taxes by about $23,000 a year. South, who is a past president of the Texas Association of Appraisal Districts, said he believes in Texas the deck is stacked against the counties because if it loses in court, the county must pay the retailer’s attorney fees and 9.5 percent interest on the refunded taxes. “In the end, it’s very costly to the homeowners because we have to shift the tax burden to them,” South said.   Wal-Mart has 600 stores in Texas. It declined to comment on the dark-store strategy. (File Photo/Andy Jacobsohn)  Routinely protest  “Just like homeowners, we want to be taxed fairly on the value of our buildings and land,” said Lowe’s spokeswoman Karen Cobb. Lowe’s said its stores generate jobs, pay state and local income tax, sales tax and property tax, and every year it routinely reviews property values assigned by county tax assessors to all 1,725 Lowe’s stores across the nation, she said. Cobb didn’t directly address the dark-store strategy. “Determining market value can be a complicated process, but in general, we look at information about comparable property in the area to help determine an appropriate value,” Cobb said. “In many cases, independent appraisers help us determine an appropriate market value for our buildings and land.” Disputing a taxable value, said Home Depot spokesman Stephen Holmes, is a common practice for any business that has physical taxable property when it believes its assessment is too high. Home Depot didn't use the dark-store strategy in Bexar County, which lowered the company's valuation of its stores from $82 a square foot to $65. Other states  While Lowe’s seems to be leading the use of the dark-store strategy in Texas, according to appraisal districts, other big box retailers, including Home Depot and Target, have used the strategy elsewhere. Michigan has been among the states hit hard by the practice as Home Depot, Lowe’s, Target and other big box stores have been able to get property appraisals cut by as much as 50 percent. Counties stand to lose millions of dollars if the dark-store method of assessing big-box stores continues to spread, according to the National Association of Counties. The county group cited a report that said in Michigan alone, store assessments have been reduced by $75 million. The dark-store strategy has also been used in Indiana, Florida, North Carolina and Alabama. In West Texas, Taylor County chief appraiser Gary Earnest heard Lowe’s dark-store argument last year on two locations in Abilene. The district settled instead of going to court. “We’re watching Bexar and Harris counties,” Earnest said. “If other big box retailers adopt this, it will create a waterfall of events.” Twitter: @MariaHalkias More on this topic:  Dallas property taxes squeeze middle class while wealthy, businesses reap advantages 'Dark store' lawsuits hit county appraiser Big-Box Stores Battle Local Governments Over Property Taxes Tax law leads to towering savings for big-building owners Plano-based At Home is recycling old spaces into new stores Why prime D-FW retail sites vacated by Sports Authority aren't going fast View Comments Tags Retail Business Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

Published September 12th On Sunday afternoon, a parking lot shooting at a Wal-Mart in Shawnee, Kansas, resulted in the injuring of two people and the death on an alleged suspect. The incident occurred when an unidentified woman stood at her car in the lot and began placing her infant child in the car seat. While she put her infant in the car, two attackers came up behind her and struck her in the back of the head.  When she was first hit, she screamed, alerting two Good Samaritans who came to her aid. As one of the Samaritans tried to help her, one of the attackers shot him multiple times. The other Good Samaritan then retrieved a gun and shot one of the alleged attackers dead, police said.  Both the injured Good Samaritan and the woman were taken to a local hospital for treatment.  The other attacker took off running east and police used video surveillance and a K-9 team to track him down.  When police arrived at an apartment complex to arrest the second suspect, his mother Janet Lewis told police that her son was home during the shooting. However, police still took Lewis’s son into custody and are considering him a possible suspect because he matched the description of the attacker on surveillance.  As police taped off the area of the attack, a shopper named Wendy Russell Macrorie captured a video of the aftermath from her car.  “Apparently right in front of my car two men have been shot,” Macrorie said in her video. “I was inside buying some light bulbs and stuff — an inner tube for my son for his bike and everybody was telling everybody not to go outside.”  The video she posted to her Facebook page captured what appeared to be the alleged dead suspect lying on the ground, just feet away from her car. However, although the situation surrounding Macrorie was extremely upsetting, the general tone and demeanor of her video seemed odd. She started off the video by saying, “So this is interesting. I am at Wal-Mart, which I hate going to, and this is happening in front of my car.” After giving her synopsis of the situation, she concluded by giving a warning for people to “be careful” when going to Wal-Mart.  The video she first posted to her Facebook has seemingly been removed, along with all other posts from her page.  As for the two injured victims, the woman’s condition was upgraded to good and her baby was unharmed in the incident. The wounded Good Samaritan was taken into surgery for his injuries and was awake and alert, officials said.  Watch Wendy Russell Macrorie’s video below. What do you think of the tone of her comments?

Christian Farr reports. (Published Wednesday, Sept. 21, 2016) After decades of tireless work, a Chicago street vendor received some much-needed financial help all because of a picture posted by a driver passing by. Fidencio Sanchez, 89, was presented with a check from GoFundMe Wednesday after more than 17,000 people donated to help raise more than $380,000 for the man and his family. Judge Orders Brendan Dassey Released by Friday Speaking in Spanish, Sanchez expressed profound gratitude for the support of not only his community, but people across the world.  "He said he’s ecstatic and he wants to give thanks to the community and the whole world everyone who has contributed to this fund," said Joel Cervantes, who started the GoFundMe campaign. "He’s very grateful, him and his wife are overwhelmed with all the outpouring of support everyone has given. He said he’ll never forget this and he thanks everyone, but most of all he thanks God." Sanchez's story garnered national attention when Cervantes spotted the elderly man hunched over and struggling to push his cart selling paletas, or popsicles, down the side of the road in the city's Little Village neighborhood. “It broke my heart seeing this man that should be enjoying retirement still working at this age,” Cervantes wrote on GoFundMe. Women Donate to Planned Parenthood in Mike Pence's Name Cervantes pulled over to snap a photo before stopping to buy 20 paletas, giving Sanchez $50, and continuing on his way. The street vendor typically only makes about $50 during an average day selling his paletas. When Cervantes got home, the image of the hardworking man couldn’t seem to leave his mind. He posted the photo on his Facebook page, with the caption, “I respect this man to the fullest, but had no idea the image would get such an overwhelming response. It was quickly shared more than 400 times. That was when his friend Jose Loera came up with the idea to start a GoFundMe campaign in hopes those inspired by Sanchez’s story could band together to make even the smallest of a difference in his family’s life.

Anything helps. Let's all pitch in and help make life a little easier and brighten both of their day.” In less than a day, the page received more than $100,000 in donations.

A study by the anti-poverty charity Global Justice Now found that the number of businesses in the top 100 economic entities jumped to 69 in 2015 from 63 in the previous year. While many emerging market economies have struggled to grow in the last couple of years, mainly as a result of China’s slowdown, many of the world’s largest corporations have increased in size. The London-based campaign group said the 10 biggest corporations – including Walmart, Apple and Shell – make more money than most countries in the world combined. The charity blamed governments for bowing to pressure from multinational firms to promote business-friendly tax regimes above the needs of their citizens. An assessment of the top 200 entities found that many smaller countries were squeezed out, leaving 153 corporations above many nations from Africa, Asia and South America. The US, China, Germany, Japan, France and the UK make up the top six economic entities followed by Italy, Brazil and Canada. Walmart ranks as the 10th largest, followed by China’s electricity monopoly State Grid at number 14, China National Petroleum at 15 and Chinese oil firm Sinopec Group at 16. Apple ranked 26th behind the 18th-placed Royal Dutch Shell, with Exxon Mobil at 21, Volkswagen at 22 and Toyota at 23. The value of the top 10 corporations was $285tn (£215tn), beating the $280tn worth of the bottom 180 countries, which include Ireland, Indonesia, Israel, Colombia, Greece, South Africa, Iraq and Vietnam. Nick Dearden, the charity’s director, said: “The vast wealth and power of corporations is at the heart of so many of the world’s problems – like inequality and climate change. “The drive for short-term profits today seems to trump basic human rights for millions of people on the planet. These figures show the problem is getting worse.” Global Justice Now said it released the figures to increase pressure on the British government ahead of a UN working group, led by Ecuador, that aims to draw up a binding treaty “to ensure transnational corporations abide by the full range of human rights responsibilities”. Campaigners said they are calling for the treaty to be legally enforceable at a national and global level. The charity has criticised Britain for refusing to support the process. Dearden said: “The UK government has facilitated this rise in corporate power through tax structures, trade deals and even aid programmes that help big business. “Their wholehearted support for the US-EU trade deal TTIP, is just the latest example of government help to big business. Disgracefully, it also routinely opposes the call of developing countries to hold corporations to account for their human rights impacts at the UN.” More news Topics Global economy Economics Apple Exxon Mobil Walmart More… Charities Royal Dutch Shell TTIP Chinese economy Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

Cowen raised its rating for Wal-Mart shares to outperform from market perform, citing the retailer's market strength and growth prospects in coming years. "A combo of price investments, creative integration of physical + digital & the Jet acquisition position WMT to regain retail dominance," analyst Oliver Chen wrote in a note to clients Monday. "We're confident WMT's positive US traffic (7 straight quarters) should continue over the next 2 years as WMT makes more aggressive price investments and makes further improvements in the customer experience." In another move, Chen lowered his rating for Target to market perform from outperform due to increased price competition. "We move to the sidelines as we lack conviction TGT can reignite comps growth, recent changes in food/pharmacy not resonating with guests & lack of upside drivers. ... In our view, WMT can use its scale to compete on price to regain or maintain market share vs. AMZN (as evidenced by WMT's y/y growth in the month of July below), but TGT cannot compete as easily," he wrote.

Abbie Bennett abennett@newsobserver.com A proposed branch of Booker Dairy Road would run behind the Walmart shopping center before connecting with Ava Gardner Boulevard. Town of Smithfield 1 of 2 i By Abbie Bennett abennett@newsobserver.com LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story The N.C. Department of Transportation is ready to move forward with widening Booker Dairy Road and connecting it to Ava Gardner Avenue. But the news is making Smithfield anxious. The project would make the road four lanes in front of Smithfield-Selma High School and Neuse Charter School. And in connecting Booker Dairy to Avenue Gardner Avenue, the project would open to development land behind Wal-Mart and Belk. Smithfield leaders, both on the council and in the business community, have long embraced the project, just like they embraced the extension of Booker Dairy from Buffalo Road to U.S. 70 Business in West Smithfield. But a presentation this past week made council members uneasy. It was the first time they had seen what they called complicated plans, and the presentation left them wondering how much money Smithfield would have to spend on water, sewer and sidewalks. “This is the first time this council’s been given this plan,” Councilman Travis Scott said. Councilman Perry Harris was equally concerned. “We’ve certainly been told this was going to happen, and we really haven’t been extremely well informed about exactly what this road entails,” he said. “I don’t know that we’ve really been involved in the process of some of this.” Mayor Andy Moore spoke for the council when he said he was unhappy with the project maps. “Let’s see if we can’t get some better drawings of this,” he told town planner Paul Embler. Harris said the project could come at a considerable cost to Smithfield if it runs water and sewer lines along the new road behind Belk and Wal-Mart. And if the town wants sidewalks along the road, that will mean even more money. “We need to be involved in this process,” Harris said. “We’ve had virtually no conversations whatsoever about where we’re going to get (the money).” The council asked Councilman Scott to be its liaison with town staff and the DOT. Last year, Gov. Pat McCrory placed the Booker Dairy Road work on a short list of transportation projects he wants done in rural North Carolina. It’s now slated for construction in 2018. That could be too soon if Smithfield’s not prepared. “Now all of a sudden, it’s moving fast,” Mayor Andy Moore said. “We’ve got to deal with the money situation,” Harris added. “We’ve got a lot to do in a very short period of time.” Harris noted that the DOT plans don’t include sidewalks. “There’s a lot of children that walk this area,” he said. “ It’s something we’ve got to consider.” Harris wanted to know why the DOT plans showed the road going through homes when vacant land was available. Embler said much in the area had changed since the DOT first drafted plans for the project nearly 20 years ago. “A long time ago,” he said, shrugging. But the DOT has started contacting affected property owners, Embler added. What the town needs is more information, Moore said. “We need to understand this road,” he said, “how it’s going to be designed, what it will mean for development in that area. “We are going to have to invest a large amount of money, and I would like for us to be able to capitalize off a new road ... from a development standpoint so we can increase our tax base, so we can hopefully recoup some of the money we’re going to have to put in.” Abbie Bennett: 910-849-2827; @AbbieRBennett Related content LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story Smithfield Herald Comments Videos facebook twitter email Share More Videos 2:21 Does race play a part in the challenge to Durham vote count?

Like Dallas News' Facebook Page Get Unlimited Digital Access Your first month is less than a dollar. $0.99 for first 4 weeks Subscribe Now A strategy successfully used by some big box stores to cut local property taxes paid in Michigan and other states is now being tried in Texas.   In at least four counties in Texas, the Lowe’s home improvement chain has challenged its tax bill, saying its property should be valued as if the buildings sat empty.   Only the stores, which are in Bexar, Harris, Hunt and Taylor counties, remain open. The so-called dark-store strategy was coined for the industry term that describes a store that’s been vacated. Retailers who use the argument to protest their property values say if the business leaves, the empty building would be hard to fill. So far, North Texas counties haven’t seen  the strategy used by big boxes, but they worry it could be spreading.  And they say if large stores are granted big reductions, the tax burden will fall increasingly on homeowners. Plano-based At Home has converted several big box stores across the U.S. as it expands into new cities. Earlier this year it opened stores in a vacated Kohl's in Plano and an empty Wal-Mart in Farmers Branch. (Brian Carlson) Highest and best use Texas counties have always valued stores based on their “highest and best use” at the beginning of each year. But the dark-store strategy seeks to change that. A lawsuit pending in Harris County District Court in Houston filed by North Carolina-based Lowe’s Cos. against the Harris County Appraisal District is being closely watched by the rest of the state’s county appraisal districts. The lawsuit lists five stores that Lowe’s is attempting to have property values reduced. Lowe’s has a separate action pending in San Antonio using the dark-store argument, but it’s not as far along. It’s still in arbitration, said Bexar County deputy chief appraiser Mary Kieki. Lowe’s is challenging assigned property values of 10 open stores in the county for each of the last three years.  The stores are currently valued at $82 a square foot. Lowe’s asked to reduce the valuation to $20 a square foot, she said. “This could be enormous,” Kieki said. “It wouldn’t stop with the big boxes like Sam’s, Lowe’s and Home Depot. You could see it continue with Kohl’s and CVS. Where does it stop?”   Heated topic Texas is Lowe’s largest state with 141 stores. It’s also the largest state for Wal-Mart which has 600 stores here. Wal-Mart declined to comment on the dark-store strategy. A Target spokeswoman said the retailer had nothing to share on the topic. Big box retailers say a store’s market value should be set at the sale price of a similar size building that’s vacant. Retailers argue the large buildings, often well over 100,000 square feet, would be difficult to sell if empty, plus deed restrictions limit future uses.    Appraisers say that’s an argument to make if a store is closed and the building stays empty without hopes of a new tenant coming in, but even then appraisers say that’s not a solid argument. “A closed store would be a case-by-case property issue,” said Collin County chief appraiser Bo Daffin. “It’s not a way to look at a category of all big box stores.” No retailer has presented Collin County with the dark-store strategy yet, Daffin said, but it’s making its way through Texas.   “It’s a very heated topic,” Daffin said. “We’re not immune to this. It could come to Collin County if it’s in Bexar and Harris counties.” If an appraisal is wrong there’s a system to protest it, he said, but changing the way appraisals are calculated using a dark-store strategy is not the way Texas does it. A shopping carts stands outside a Sports Authority store. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News) Limited litigation funds  The Dallas County Appraisal District doesn’t have any dark-store issues, said Cheryl Jordan, a spokeswoman for the district.   Nearby Hunt County settled with Lowe’s over the 2014 valuation of a Lowe’s store in Greenville. “They used the dark-store strategy, but we didn’t go to trial,” said Brent South, Hunt County’s chief appraiser. The legal costs associated with taking the case to court would have been too high for a county with an annual litigation budget of $50,000, he said. “We didn’t have the resources to go to trial.” Hunt County settled for a valuation that reduced Lowe’s property taxes by about $23,000 a year. South, who is a past president of the Texas Association of Appraisal Districts, said he believes in Texas the deck is stacked against the counties because if it loses in court, the county must pay the retailer’s attorney fees and 9.5 percent interest on the refunded taxes. “In the end, it’s very costly to the homeowners because we have to shift the tax burden to them,” South said.   Wal-Mart has 600 stores in Texas. It declined to comment on the dark-store strategy. (File Photo/Andy Jacobsohn)  Routinely protest  “Just like homeowners, we want to be taxed fairly on the value of our buildings and land,” said Lowe’s spokeswoman Karen Cobb. Lowe’s said its stores generate jobs, pay state and local income tax, sales tax and property tax, and every year it routinely reviews property values assigned by county tax assessors to all 1,725 Lowe’s stores across the nation, she said. Cobb didn’t directly address the dark-store strategy. “Determining market value can be a complicated process, but in general, we look at information about comparable property in the area to help determine an appropriate value,” Cobb said. “In many cases, independent appraisers help us determine an appropriate market value for our buildings and land.” Disputing a taxable value, said Home Depot spokesman Stephen Holmes, is a common practice for any business that has physical taxable property when it believes its assessment is too high. Home Depot didn't use the dark-store strategy in Bexar County, which lowered the company's valuation of its stores from $82 a square foot to $65. Other states  While Lowe’s seems to be leading the use of the dark-store strategy in Texas, according to appraisal districts, other big box retailers, including Home Depot and Target, have used the strategy elsewhere. Michigan has been among the states hit hard by the practice as Home Depot, Lowe’s, Target and other big box stores have been able to get property appraisals cut by as much as 50 percent. Counties stand to lose millions of dollars if the dark-store method of assessing big-box stores continues to spread, according to the National Association of Counties. The county group cited a report that said in Michigan alone, store assessments have been reduced by $75 million. The dark-store strategy has also been used in Indiana, Florida, North Carolina and Alabama. In West Texas, Taylor County chief appraiser Gary Earnest heard Lowe’s dark-store argument last year on two locations in Abilene. The district settled instead of going to court. “We’re watching Bexar and Harris counties,” Earnest said. “If other big box retailers adopt this, it will create a waterfall of events.” Twitter: @MariaHalkias More on this topic:  Dallas property taxes squeeze middle class while wealthy, businesses reap advantages 'Dark store' lawsuits hit county appraiser Big-Box Stores Battle Local Governments Over Property Taxes Tax law leads to towering savings for big-building owners Plano-based At Home is recycling old spaces into new stores Why prime D-FW retail sites vacated by Sports Authority aren't going fast View Comments Tags Retail Business Share Facebook Twitter Email Print This Story Get the Most Important D-FW News in Your Inbox Sign up for our daily email newsletters Get Headlines, Business, SportsDay, and GuideLive.

The company produces premium wood pellets as a heating fuel and has been experimenting with pelletizing grains for animal feed. Despite what the bags say, the pellets are all made of softwood. The brothers said they had ordered 14,000 bags marked hardwood/softwood blend before they determined that softwood would work best with their manufacturing system.

By Nick Sambides Jr., BDN Staff Follow on Twitter Find on Facebook Posted Sept. 12, 2016, at 6:23 a.m. Poll Question Take Our Poll PATTEN, Maine — Brothers Adam and Matthew Fronczak sit astride three industries dear to Patten — forestry, farming and milling — and it can make for some scattershot workdays. On any given day, 48-year-old Matthew might find himself welding a patch onto a conveyer belt in Patten, doing soil tests in Old Town and picking up auto parts in Bangor while 51-year-old Adam calls customers and surveys abandoned farmland off Route 11. “There are so many projects and directions to go in that there’s just not enough hours in the day,” Adam Fronczak said recently. The very versatile brothers, who are former lobstermen, are general managers of Haymart, a farming and milling operation that town officials hope will be a great boost to the upper Katahdin region economy. Story continues below advertisement. A dual-purpose mill The 175-year-old empty mill site on Mill Street was acquired in 2013 by an investor who wishes to remain anonymous, the brothers said. The two managers began working on it immediately. Since opening the facility in January 2016, the brothers have expanded their payroll from three to 13 full-time workers and begun round-the-clock manufacturing of softwood pellets five days per week. Their goal is to produce 5,000 tons of home-heating pellets this year and double that amount next year. They also are growing barley, oats, soybeans and wheat to make feed pellets for hogs, cows and other livestock or for sale as organic produce. Haymart owns or contracts with 14 formerly abandoned farms totaling more than 4,200 acres in Maine, Arkansas, Missouri and Nebraska, according to the company website, Haymart.com. The Maine farmlands include a 1,200-acre plot in Old Town off Route 116, 900 acres in West Enfield off Route 2 and a total of 150 acres over several plots off Clark Road and Route 11 in Patten. “Our mill is set up for dual purposes,” Adam Fronczak said. Their Haymart Hotties wood pellets are sold through 16 outlets, including 10 Wal-Mart stores stretching from Waterville into northern Maine and smaller retailers such as Nicatou Stoves of Medway, Brownlee Builders of Patten and Aroostook Milling of Houlton. They also are contracted to supply pellets to heat several Katahdin Valley health centers in northern Maine as the centers convert to pellet heating systems, the brothers said. The Wal-Mart contract could occupy their one $750,000 pellet manufacturing system full time, but the brothers said they will be maintaining their other contracts and will continue experimenting with feed-pellet production. They’ve produced a few thousand pounds of feed pellets to date. They hope to add another manufacturing system to ramp up wood- and feed-pellet production by mid-2017, increasing their staff to as many as 30 workers, the Fronczaks said. The perils of pellet making Haymart’s production methodology is comprehensive and thrifty. The brothers buy abandoned and often heavily overgrown farmland and clear it of trees and other growth. Not just any farm will do. “It all starts with the correct soils,” Matthew Fronczak said. The biomass culled from the land is turned into pellets, used to fuel their mill’s biomass heating system or sold to other biomass energy boilers. Then they seed the farmland for certified-organic crops. This, their first year of crop growth, has gone well, Matthew Fronczak said. “Everything is going good. Our crops shot right out of the ground this year,” he said. “All of our barley has come up good.” Yet, production itself has been challenging. Pellet manufacturing is almost an art: Wet weather, moisture levels in the chosen wood products and the manufacturing system’s temperature settings can have a wildly dramatic impact on pellet quality. Experimentation and the company’s addition of moisture measuring equipment to its manufacturing system two or three weeks ago has greatly improved pellet production consistency, according to Jamie Kaelin, 38, of Crystal, who works as a laborer at Haymart. “There are a lot of moving parts to this,” Kaelin said. “Now production is doing really good. We’ve stepped it up a lot in the last week or so.” A ‘psychological lift’ The company’s relatively swift growth and ambitious plans have been a tonic to a Patten area that suffered a heavy blow when Shaw Industries Group Inc. of Dalton, Georgia, laid off 18 workers and closed the wood veneering mill it owned at the Haymart mill in 2010. “We have been sort of adrift since then, and the fact that we can point to them being there, even if there’s not a great deal of economic significance to what they’re doing so far, still gives us a psychological lift,” Patten Town Manager Raymond Foss said. “You feel better about the town knowing that it [the mill site] is active because for three or four years it wasn’t.” The company’s impact on the local economy is likely greater than its 13 positions, but it is difficult to say how much greater. Economists place manufacturing as among the most valuable employment sectors. Economic estimates indicate that manufacturing typically creates at least four jobs indirectly for every single job directly created. Haymart’s impact, however, might be dulled because it seeks very versatile workers who, like the Fronczaks, can handle a variety of assignments. Finding good help is a chronic problem for many northern Maine businesses, but filling a job that requires farming, mechanical and forest products skills at $10 to $15 per hour with one person instead of two or three is even more difficult. “It remains our biggest challenge,” Adam Fronczak said. “Finding a farmer is fine, but putting him into a feller buncher” — a machine that cuts trees and strips branches from tree logs — “or in the shop here — that’s difficult,” Matthew Fronczak said. A ‘good all-around sense’ Finding the time to train and oversee workers is also taxing, and some of the job candidates themselves have come with heavy luggage. Two potential drivers never got hired because they failed drug tests. Haymart has contracted with local farms and members of the local Amish community for workers and supplies when needed. The Amish, Matthew Fronczak said, are excellent workers, and the brothers are considering working closely with the local vocational high school to groom workers. The Fronczaks’ versatility and equilibrium at coping with the rigors of a startup business have impressed Kristen Wittine, the company’s office manager. Besides running the company, they installed the manufacturing system, electrical supply and plumbing to the mill, which includes a large heated warehouse floor where the company’s finished pellets are stored. The indoor storage keeps the pellets dry — a critical advantage to keeping them sellable, Matthew Fronczak said. “They truly were pulled from one industry into a totally new setting, and they had the good all-around sense to do it,” Wittine said of the brothers. “To me, this is something that a person with an engineering degree could have done.” The brothers, who both have high school educations, however, are good mentors — even-tempered and analytical, Wittine said. Their skills mesh well. Adam is good with the finances and customer service while Matthew is probably more adept with mechanical things. “They can read each other very well, and one is always available [to handle problems] if the other has to step out,” she said. Now that the brothers have their business running, they face a startup businesses’ next challenge: Doing what they can to make their pellets and organic produce sell well. “We seem to be finding a market for our products,” Adam Fronczak said. “It’s fun,” Matthew Fronczak said. “We like to work.”   Recommend this article SEE COMMENTS → Previous story:« Wayfair cuts ribbon on Bangor call center, continues Maine hiring effort Next story:Free speech law doesn’t always protect social media bashing of bad service » News Blogs Living Sports Opinion Hollis woman shot five times by man trying to save her It’s unclear whether Trump could abolish the North Woods monument Maine man charged after allegedly threatening to kill Obama, Pingree Man charged with manslaughter in Bath parking lot shooting to plead to lesser charge Official: Pending inmate release prompts security precautions at MDI school With few wins to celebrate in Maine’s addiction fight, here’s one worth acknowledging Friday, Nov. 18, 2016: Accept election results, fix health care, Trump’s hateful rhetoric Trump won the presidency, but can he unite a divided nation?

Here’s a Viewing Guide to All 43 of His Movies By Will Leitch and Tim Grierson Plus a rank of every Hanks live-action film. 1.3k Shares Share 1.3k Tweet 0 Share 2 Share Email Print Share You might say there’s a unified theory of Hanks: The actor contains multitudes, but is always Tom Hanks. As a result, he’s often accused of playing one character: the fundamentally decent, good-hearted, noble but humble all-American everyman. There’s some truth to this, of course — Hanks wouldn’t work as Travis Bickle, no matter how hard he tried. But it’s not fair to paint Hanks as playing the same character over and over, and it certainly wouldn’t be fair to say that he doesn’t challenge himself or take chances. Hanks has transformed himself from the party-dude of Bachelor Party to the romantic lead of Sleepless in Seattle to the war hero of Saving Private Ryan to the six different characters he plays, amusingly, in Cloud Atlas. The guy might only play a certain number of notes, but he always manages to make them sound unique. All of his movies can be grouped into seven different categories, though, and if you’re in the mood for the sort of entertainment only a Hanks movie can provide, this guide is a good jumping-off point. We’ve arranged his filmography into buckets based on the sort of Hanks performance you can expect, ranked the movies within each grouping, and indicated where you can find them on streaming. (To see Inferno and Sully, you’ll have to head to a theater.) We’ve also indicated in parentheses where each title falls in our overall rank of Tom Hanks movies, in case you’re simply looking for the best of the best. A note: We limited our guide to live-action movies only, meaning Hanks’s superb turns in the three Toy Story films aren’t on the list. It goes without saying that there’s never a bad time to watch a Toy Story movie. HANKS AS WACKY BOSOM BUDDIES GUY Hanks broke out as a comedic leading man straight from the sitcom world, and it’s worth noting that the Tom Hanks Character, in the '80s, was much more elastic and clownish than the one we see today. But even during that period, you could see him evolving. Big (1988) (Rank: 6) This was the one that made everybody realize: Oh, Hanks isn’t just a comedy guy, he could maybe be the biggest movie star in the world. As the boy who gets his wish to be big, Hanks gives a glorious, hilarious, and sweet performance as a 12-year-old in a grown-up’s body. He’s limber and wild and untethered — it’s one of his best physical comedy performances — but he never lets you forget there’s a scared little kid in there. Hanks didn't win Best Actor* for this performance, even though the movie was a huge hit, which was seen by many at the time as a sign that comedy was never going to be given a break by the Academy. Nevertheless, this performance is guaranteed to bring a smile to your face. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Splash (1984) (Rank: 11) A massive hit that essentially launched the film careers of Hanks, Daryl Hannah, and Ron Howard, Splash is funny and sharp, particularly when it takes its fish-out-of-water premise literally and lets Hannah’s mermaid try to interact with mid-’80s New York City. There are some parts that might be called “problematic” today — and there’s always been an argument that Hanks and sidekick John Candy should have switched roles — but this, as much anything else, was what initially sold everyone on Hanks. Even when he’s being a jerk (and he’s a jerk a lot in the movie), you can’t help but be on his side. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Punchline (1988) (Rank: 22) Punchline confused audiences and critics when it came out because it was a movie about stand-up comedy that was not all that funny. That was by design, though, and the film has aged better than you might think. Hanks plays a struggling stand-up comedian who comes across a housewife (Sally Field) trying out on open-mic nights who turns out to be pretty good. Hanks resents her success but also cares for her — and, as the movie hints, he has some emotional instability issues of his own. Hanks isn’t much of a stand-up comic — you never buy that he’s any good — but he gets at the desperation at the heart of showbiz. It’s a better performance, and movie, than people appreciated at the time. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Bachelor Party (1984) (Rank: 26) Your mileage is going to vary on a lot of the Tom Hanks, Disposable Lead of Dopey ’80s Comedies, entries, but this one is definitely one of the silliest, dumbest and, amusingly, most eternal: There are movies from this time period that Hanks can hide from now, but this is definitely not one of them. After all, this is a movie in which a donkey does cocaine. Don’t see that every day. Available to rent on: Amazon Dragnet (1987) (Rank: 27) The closest Hanks will ever come to playing Poochie, the skateboarding dog from The Simpsons. Hanks is the young, “cool” cop contrasting with Dan Aykroyd’s Joe Friday impression, and he has as much fun as you can in a silly movie in which Aykroyd considers himself the star. The major takeaway is a deeply disturbing “rap” video Aykroyd and Hanks made to promote the film. Watch at your own peril. “I’m here tonight, to rap about your rights.” Yikes. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes Turner & Hooch (1989) (Rank: 32) The buddy cop-with-a-dog movie that, despite being a hit, famously inspired Hanks to start reevaluating his career — making the pivot that would win him multiple Oscars — Turner & Hooch isn’t that terrible. (Well, it’s not any worse than Tango & Cash, how about that?) However, proceed with caution: If you get sad when a dog dies in a movie, you will cry a lot. (Er, spoiler alert?) Available with subscription on Netflix; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Volunteers (1985) (Rank: 33) It’s tough for Hanks to play a jerk, but he’s definitely a snobby jerk in this Nicholas Meyer comedy about a rich kid who has to escape angry creditors pursuing a gambling debt by joining the Peace Corps. There’s not much here — it was the end of an aborted Hanks-and-Candy comedy team — but it is where Hanks met his wife Rita Wilson, so there’s that. Available with subscription on HBO; to rent on Amazon Nothing in Common (1986) (Rank: 34) Hanks plays an advertising executive whose life is turned upside down — this is the exact description of many Hanks roles at this time — when his parents (Jackie Gleason and Eva Marie Saint) get divorced and he has to take care of both of them. This is high-concept and tiresome, and Gleason, in particular, hams it up every time he’s onscreen, but this was the start of Hanks’s pivot toward a more “serious” screen persona. He’s not particularly funny in the film; he’s trying to play this one straight. Nothing in Common wasn’t the appropriate vehicle for that, but the instinct was right. Available to rent on: Amazon, Vudu, iTunes The ’Burbs (1989) (Rank: 35) A theoretically “dark” comedy about a bored suburban dad who begins to think his neighbors are murderers. There’s a lot to be mined here, but Hanks and his director, Joe Dante — who would go on to till this field far better in other movies — go way too broad way too often. The movie dissolves into nonsense by the end. In 1989, Hanks made this and that dog movie … and then wisely moved in a whole new direction. Available with subscription on Netflix; to rent on iTunes The Money Pit (1986) (Rank: 38) There were times, early on, when Hanks’s white-bread geniality would be forced to do too much of the heavy lifting, and this strained comedy with Shelley Long is a great example. The one-joke premise is that the dream house Hanks and Long have bought is falling apart, and the movie keeps trying to find new ways to make that exact point, with diminishing results. Hanks doesn’t look bored with this lane yet, but he is starting to seem a little exhausted. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu The Man With One Red Shoe (1985) (Rank: 41) An instantly forgettable “comedy thriller” in which Hanks plays a doofus concert pianist thrust clumsily into a murder mystery. He’s clearly dialed up a little too high in order to carry a thin, empty premise, but still, check out the supporting cast: Dabney Coleman, Charles Durning, Jim Belushi, Edward Herrmann, and a finally-done-playing-Leia (for another 30 years, anyway) Carrie Fisher. Available with subscription on HBO; to rent on: Amazon, Vudu, iTunes He Knows You’re Alone (1981) (Rank: 42) Hanks’s movie debut was a slasher film that’s an obvious Halloween knockoff, right down to the mask and music. It’s cheapo schlock, but it’ll live forever because of Hanks’s appearance as a student who’s skeptical that the protagonist is really being stalked. His dialogue clearly sets him up to be murdered, but the filmmakers liked him so much that they decided to let his character live. Even in his first movie, Hanks was charming everybody. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes HANKS AS ROMANTIC LEAD The Hanks your mom loves. The Hanks that will line the shelves of Walmart well past a nuclear holocaust. Sleepless in Seattle (1993) (Rank: 10) If movies like Sleepless in Seattle were all Hanks ever made, we wouldn’t hold the actor in such high esteem. And yet, c’mon, it’s so hard to resist him as Sam, the puppy-dog widower who will fall for a newspaper reporter (Meg Ryan) with a fondness for An Affair to Remember. Sprinkled with fairy dust and charm by late director Nora Ephron, Sleepless in Seattle is the epitome of feel-good, wish-fulfillment Hollywood love stories, and Hanks gives it a grounding that it very much needs. He’s sensitive and appealing — as unthreatening as the nice guy next door with a decency and cuteness that made him crush-worthy. Available to rent on: Amazon, Vudu, iTunes Joe Versus the Volcano (1990) (Rank: 16) John Patrick Shanley’s funky, off-kilter romantic comedy was a little too weird for audiences at the time, but it has aged well: This story of a man (Hanks) who decides to kill himself by throwing himself into a volcano before being interrupted by a series of increasingly odd events has its own goofy rhythm that Hanks steadies and smooths out, though maybe a little too much. The fact that Hanks toplined the movie may have given the impression of its being more conventional that it is, causing people to reject it outright. It’s worth a revisit. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes You’ve Got Mail (1998) (Rank: 18) Sleepless co-stars Hanks and Ryan went back to the rom-com well in 1998, with lesser results. Hanks gets to play the romantic hero with a little bit more of an edge this time — he’s a big-time bookstore-conglomerate CEO trying to shut down cute Meg Ryan’s little independent bookstore — but he’s still gooey in the middle and easily palatable to the older white audience that ate this up. Suffice it to say, the AOL-centric narrative hasn’t aged well, but hey … is that Dave Chappelle? Available with subscription on Amazon; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Larry Crowne (2011) (Rank: 28) Hanks’s second film as director was a bust: a well-intentioned look at working-class Americans who were rocked by the 2008 financial collapse that was patronizing and glib. He plays Larry, a normal joe who gets fired from his Walmart-like job and has to reinvent himself, falling in love with Julia Roberts’s college professor in the process. Larry Crowne is the sort of movie that makes you understand why conservatives go off on tirades about out-of-touch, liberal Hollywood stars. There isn’t a whiff of reality to this story, and Hanks is like an alien trying to play an everyman — he’s rarely seemed so uncomfortable and unconvincing. Available with subscription on Netflix; to rent on: Amazon, Vudu, iTunes Every Time We Say Goodbye (1986) (Rank: 37) This was Hanks’s first attempt at “stretching” in a saccharine love story set during World War II in which he plays a soldier who loses his true love. Hanks hadn’t quite figured out how to calibrate Comedy vs. Serious yet, so he responds to this “serious” challenge by basically shutting down his charisma altogether. He would get much better at finding the balance. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu EXPERIMENTAL HANKS Hanks is a more ambitious actor than he might appear: He’s aware you think he’s playing the same character every time out, and knows sometimes he has to surprise us. Forrest Gump (1994) (Rank: 3) This Best Picture winner’s litany of famous lines — “Run, Forrest, Run,” “Life is like a box of chocolates,” “Jenny” — risks reducing the movie to a series of quotables as simple as the man Hanks played to earn his second Oscar. But the beauty of his performance is in how it both satirizes a divisive period in American history while also underlining the sincerity and optimism that’s always been part of our national character. Sure, that’s a corny notion, but it took an actor who could transform that sentimentality into something stirring and true, and nobody on the planet was better suited for the role than Hanks. Available with subscription on Netflix; to rent on: Amazon, Vudu, iTunes Cast Away (2000) (Rank: 4) The closest Hanks has gotten to a Robert De Niro–like physical transformation, Cast Away found the star playing a FedEx executive who goes through a personal metamorphosis after he’s the lone survivor of a plane crash. Taking time off from shooting so that he could lose a massive amount of weight for the island sequences, Hanks exudes the sense of spiritual isolation that first maroons the character but then gives him a new reason to go on living. This might be his most intimate and elemental performance, his primary scene partner being a volleyball, and Hanks finds a raw, slightly terrifying urgency within his good-guy persona that suggests that even the best of us have a breaking point. Available to rent on: Amazon, Vudu, iTunes Philadelphia (1993) (Rank: 13) No matter the good intentions of everyone involved in this activist drama — to say nothing of its social importance — there’s no denying that Philadelphia isn’t exactly scintillating cinema. The same goes for Hanks’s performance as a lawyer diagnosed with AIDS. To be sure, it’s lovely and full of feeling, but he risks making Andrew Beckett almost too saintly, which made some sense in an era when homosexuality was viewed as a scary “other.” Hanks’s natural likability attacked that bigotry directly, and for that the performance remains incredibly meaningful. But Andrew is more symbol than great character — a significant time-capsule relic slightly diminished by the fortunate evolution of human thinking about sexuality and AIDS. Available with subscription on Amazon; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Road to Perdition (2002) (Rank: 21) A hit man with soul, Michael Sullivan must protect his son (future Everybody Wants Some!! star Tyler Hoechlin) after the mob wants to rub them both out. Road to Perdition got a lot of press at the time for the fact that, hey, look, Hanks is playing a bad guy. Of course, the character isn’t really bad: He’s a gruff but concerned parent who lives by a strict moral code. Director Sam Mendes’s period crime film is suffocated by its finely manicured production design and gorgeous Conrad Hall cinematography, which gives the actors very little room to breathe. As a result, we get an intriguing curveball of a performance from Hanks, but not a great or even a particularly revealing one. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu A Hologram for the King (2016) (Rank: 23) Hanks provides some pathos to his role as a washed-up American businessman trying to close a deal in Saudi Arabia, but A Hologram for the King can’t escape the fact that it’s approximately the 1,428,721st drama about a depressed, middle-aged white guy at a spiritual crossroads. The star brings his all, but the whole enterprise is hamstrung from the start — although Hanks gets to show off his romantic leading-man side for the first time in a while opposite a very appealing Sarita Choudhury. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu HANKS AS PLUG-IN STUDIO LEAD When you’re the biggest movie star in the world, as Hanks was for a few years, you just get cast as the lead in movies just because you’re the biggest movie star in the world. Sometimes it’s a fit. Sometimes, less so. The Green Mile (1999) (Rank: 15) The Green Mile is the sort of bloated awards-bait that doesn’t work at all unless you’ve got somebody like Tom Hanks piloting the ship. Even then, he can only do so much with the role of Paul Edgecomb, a predictably good-hearted prison guard who befriends Michael Clarke Duncan’s death-row prisoner with strange powers. The syrup is pretty thick in this three-hour-plus (!) Frank Darabont adaptation of a Stephen King inspirational drama, and thankfully Hanks steered away from this kind of mawkishness in subsequent years. Soon, he’d be traveling into weirder and darker terrain. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu The Da Vinci Code (2006) (Rank: 30) Hanks and Ron Howard’s adaptation of Dan Brown’s blockbuster novel is by-the-numbers and uninspired, but it’s professionally done in a way that’s mostly inoffensive. Still, these are two ambitious and creative people, and it feels like a waste to have them going through the paces of this sort of hackery. Available with subscription on Netflix; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu The Polar Express (2004) (Rank: 31) Amazingly, this is one of two movies in which Hanks plays six characters. The technologically groundbreaking but narratively uneven Polar Express animates Chris Van Allsburg’s children’s book through what was a fancy new innovation at the time: motion-capture. The dead-eyed look of the film’s characters still haunts our dreams, but we also object to Hanks’s overly cutesy performances as the conductor, Santa Claus, and others. It’s a fine line when acting in a movie that’s meant to be magical: You get the balance wrong, and the whole thing ends up feeling aggressively adorable and self-satisfied. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Inferno (2106) (Rank: 39) The Robert Langdon movies are generally Hanks at his worst — not bad, necessarily, but his most complacent and going through the motions — and while this one isn’t the worst of the bunch, he doesn’t give it much extra oomph. As our colleague Jackson McHenry noted, Inferno provides a slight twist on "the young woman following Robert Langdon through historical landmarks" formula, but not in any way that justifies its existence. Please, let Hanks be done with these now. In theaters now The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990) (Rank: 40) “I did everything I could to make it work,” Hanks said in 1992 about this Brian De Palma debacle. “And the fallout from it was that it makes you reflect for a while. You question yourself. But what can you do? You take your shots and you swing away.” Yes, this adaptation of Tom Wolfe’s Zeitgeist-y novel was a failure, but it’s an interesting failure in lots of ways, not least of which is watching Hanks trying to play the story’s Master-of-the-Universe Wall Street operative. He has the character’s All-American features but not the toxic spirit, which fatally wounds the entire film. It’s but one problem with a high-profile bust that at least inspired a pretty good behind-the-scenes tell-all. Available with subscription on HBO; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Angels and Demons (2009) (Rank: 43) Hanks always looks a little ridiculous in these movies — and they’ve always felt like his one way to assure himself a studio hit; outside the Toy Story movies, they’re the only sequels he has ever done — but this one is preposterous and flimsy. Hanks gives low-key performances all the time, but this is the only time he has looked actively bored. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu HANKS FAMILY PLAYTIME Sometimes, Hanks just wants to hang out with his kids and friends. Hey, guys, let’s put on a movie! That Thing You Do! (1996) (Rank: 25) Hanks’s directorial debut — which includes his Bosom Buddies co-star Peter Scolari, plus Rita Wilson, Colin Hanks, and Elizabeth Hanks — is modest and pleasant, like you would expect it to be, even if it doesn’t add up to much. Hanks plays the world’s most benevolent music promoter, and it’s the sort of movie you dance along to; nice little background music while you do something else. If they were all like this, the world would be a much friendlier place. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu The Great Buck Howard (2008) (Rank: 36) In this mostly dull bauble about a kid (Colin Hanks) who works for a possibly fraudulent huckster magician (John Malkovich), Hanks shows up briefly as a skeptical dad. This is the first and only time Hanks plays the father of his real-life son Colin, and he’s amiable enough to show up and then get out of his kid’s way. Available to rent on: iTunes, Vudu HANKS AS AMERICAN AVATAR Hanks is often clothed as a sort of stand-in for the American character, a suit that’s so impossible to fill out that it’s pretty amazing how well it fits him. Saving Private Ryan (1998) (Rank: 1) When we first see Captain Miller, his hands are shaking as he puts his canteen to his lips before beginning the D-day assault on Normandy. He’s scared, as would anyone be in that situation. The greatness of Saving Private Ryan can be measured in many ways — the harrowing brilliance of its opening battle sequence, the stunning desaturated images of war rendered by cinematographer Janusz Kamiński — but it’s ultimately a very human story, which is why Steven Spielberg cast Hollywood’s most reliable and relatable everyman star in the role. As the film pounds along and the body count builds, we learn that Miller was the kind of American hero World War II probably produced a lot of: an ordinary guy back home who turned himself into a leader of men because the fate of the planet hung in the balance. Hanks is as stripped-down as the landscape, hoping that rescuing Ryan will be enough to get him home and forget all this terrible killing. His death in the final moments haunts you long after the film’s over, with Hanks paying tribute to a lot of good soldiers who went off to safeguard freedom and never saw America again. Available with subscription on Netflix; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Captain Phillips (2013) (Rank: 2) Hanks's terrified, vulnerable turn as the eponymous Captain Phillips is another prime example of his ordinary men in extraordinary circumstances.* Hanks’s Phillips is a good captain but also a flawed one, and one who is constantly adjusting to events that are entirely out of his control. He does his best just to stay alive, but when the ordeal is finally over and he is able to take stock, he breaks down in the most raw, wrenching scene of Hanks’s whole career. It’s a measured, calculated performance that builds to a moment of almost overwhelming power. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Apollo 13 (1995) (Rank: 5) There is a chance that, if you haven’t seen this Best Picture nominee in a while, all you remember of it is Hanks’s Jim Lovell saying, “Houston, we have a problem.” Go back and watch Apollo 13 and you’ll see Hanks eschewing the flash of his then-recent Oscar-winning portrayals for a no-nonsense turn as a mission commander who is bound and determined to keep his crew (Bill Paxton, Kevin Bacon) focused as they and Mission Control figure out how to get their crippled vessel home. This is a performance that’s easy to shortchange, but Hanks imbues it with endlessly stirring, stripped-down authority. He makes not losing your shit in the midst of a crisis feel heroic. Available with subscription on Amazon; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Bridge of Spies (2015) (Rank: 8) Hanks’s innate decency plays a part in several films, but it’s delivered in a different way in this underrated Cold War drama. Hanks is Donovan, an insurance lawyer asked to defend a Russian spy (Oscar winner Mark Rylance), in the process learning that he alone wants to be sure the accused gets a fair trial. Bridge of Spies is a movie about negotiation and compromise — about what principles we’re willing to sacrifice and which ones we can’t — and Donovan is heroic not because he’s the guy with the halo but because he’s shrewder and more determined than everyone he comes across. This is Hanks as World-Weary Veteran Movie Star, and he gives it an effortless swagger. Available to rent on: Vudu Charlie Wilson’s War (2007) (Rank: 9) Charlie Wilson was a hard-partying, womanizing Texas congressman who helped arm the mujahideen against the invading Russians during the 1980s. It’s a too-good-to-be-true real-life tale, and Hanks (who also produced) has a ball playing a sonuvabitch who’s been wasting his life until he finds a cause worthy of his talents. Charlie Wilson’s War is deeply flawed — director Mike Nichols and writer Aaron Sorkin oversell the movie’s “colorful” world of vulgar CIA operatives and sassy Texas socialites — but Hanks gives the cartoonish story a moral center without sacrificing the tale’s more unbelievable moments and its dark punch line: Wilson’s seemingly patriotic actions will sow the seeds for Middle Eastern terrorism against the West. Available with subscription on HBO; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Catch Me If You Can (2002) (Rank: 12) You could argue that Hanks’s character is only the third-most interesting in this Steven Spielberg biopic about professional con man Frank Abagnale. (Rising star Leonardo DiCaprio has the showier role as Abagnale, and Christopher Walken, playing his hard-luck father, got the Oscar nomination.) But Hanks does commendable supporting work as a nerdy FBI agent on Abagnale’s trail — essentially playing the sort of conventional square whose mediocre life frightens the restless, rootless Abagnale. What’s funniest about Catch Me If You Can is how it represented a permanent shift in Hanks’s persona: The bratty upstart from Dragnet was now old enough (and established enough) to be the just-the-facts-ma’am law-and-order type. Still, there’s a twinkle in Hanks’s eye. Even as a square, he’s so damn likable. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Sully (2016) (Rank: 14) Playing Sully Sullenberger, Hanks gives a calmly assured performance that’s easy to underrate — he does a whole lot by doing not much of anything. In Clint Eastwood’s spare drama, Sullenberger has just piloted his crippled US Airways flight into the Hudson, avoiding tragedy, but now he must answer to federal investigators who question his strategy. Sully never questions the man’s heroism, but Sully himself does, and Hanks’s portrayal is one in which self-doubt eats away at the character — which, coupled with having just survived a horrifying ordeal, leaves him feeling discombobulated and adrift. Sullenberger comes across as haunted, shaken, trying to put himself back together, and Hanks makes that healing feel quietly inspiring. In theaters now Saving Mr. Banks (2013) (Rank: 24) Tom Hanks playing Walt Disney in the story of how Mary Poppins got turned into a beloved film feels like money in the bank. So, what happened? Saving Mr. Banks isn’t bad so much as it’s uninspired and safe — probably an inevitable result considering that the Disney studio was behind the biopic and wanted to make sure it stayed on-brand. Still, the disappointment extends to Hanks’s portrayal. He’s a more-than-credible Walt, amplifying the man’s megawatt showmanship and gregariousness, but it doesn’t zig or zag in any interesting directions. The movie wants us to think that Disney was a super-swell genius, which pretty much guarantees that nuance, curiosity, or wit aren’t going to be part of the equation. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (2011) (Rank: 29) There are many, many reasons people hate this 9/11 drama, but it’s hard to put the blame on Hanks. That’s largely because he’s barely in it, playing the dead father of the film’s autistic young hero (Thomas Horn) who goes on a quest across the city to solve a riddle his dad left for him. In flashbacks, Hanks is more than credible as a man who fears for his sensitive son, but the overt preciousness of this Oscar-nominated enterprise makes it hard to see that sincerity through the aggressive pretension. Available with subscription on Netflix; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu HANKS STRIKING ONE WEIRD NOTE Hanks has a prankster quality that’s a little underrated: Sometimes, he’ll just decide, “I’m doing one gag for a whole movie.” And generally he pulls it off. A League of Their Own (1992) (Rank: 7) Beefing up for his role as Jimmy Dugan, the alcoholic manager of a women-only baseball team, Hanks gets to play the lovable crank, the kind of part he didn’t do much after becoming a major movie star. A League of Their Own catches the actor in an interesting in-between spot in his career — he was rebounding from the failure of Bonfire of the Vanities, but not yet at the stage where he’d win back-to-back Oscars — and as such, it’s kind of a hoot to see him just bark at characters and be downright ornery. Of course, Dugan’s got a good heart underneath, and it’s the sort of one-note character that could have easily drifted into caricature, but Hanks elevates him through sheer force of his charisma and sweetness. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu The Terminal (2004) (Rank: 17) Steven Spielberg’s doodle about an optimistic, good-hearted Eastern European tourist who gets stuck in bureaucratic limbo and thus lives at New York’s JFK Airport for nearly a year is maybe a little too cute by half, but Hanks still makes you root for the guy, even when Spielberg is drowning in whimsy. That said, this has to be the most forgettable movie these two ever made together. Available to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu The Ladykillers (2004) (Rank: 19) Hanks’s one Coen Brothers film is perhaps their most divisive and disliked one — it’s pretty broad, even for the Coens, and it really just has one joke — but it’s not Hanks’s fault. His Goldthwaite Higginson Dorr — the character is as subtle as the name — is cartoonish and silly and way way way over the top, but Hanks is clearly having a blast playing him. Hanks’s sincerity was never going to be a good fit with the Coens, but he does his best to get on their wavelength in a goofy, game-for-anything performance. The real problem here is that Hanks brings his A-game to a period of transition for the Coens, when they weren’t quite sure what their next step was going to be. (They figured it out.) Available with subscription on Showtime; to rent on: Amazon, iTunes, Vudu Cloud Atlas (2012) (Rank: 20) Pitched to him by the Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer as a combination of Moby-Dick and 2001: A Space Odyssey, Cloud Atlas is easily the most audacious film Hanks has ever made: a gonzo sci-fi epic that spans eras and languages, casting him in multiple roles. It’s also probably his most divisive, its strengths and weaknesses hopelessly linked and at war with one another. That’s just as true of Hanks’s performances, which are a warning that bad wigs and weird makeup do not good characters make. Hanks has never let loose quite the way he does in Cloud Atlas, and consequently there’s something oddly riveting about the risks he takes. But he falls flat on his face a whole lot here — and he should never, ever play a cockney again.

When it was over, one attacker was dead and one Good Samaritan was in critical condition at a hospital. Police later said he was awake and alert and scheduled for surgery later Sunday. The woman, who initially was hospitalized in critical condition with a head injury, was upgraded to good Sunday evening, and police said she might soon be released. Police Maj. Dan Tennis said the woman was attacked as she put her infant in a car seat about 1:30 p.m. in the parking lot of the store near Shawnee Mission Parkway and Maurer Road. The woman was struck in the back of the head. As she screamed, a Good Samaritan came to her aid. One of the attackers shot him multiple times. A second Good Samaritan then shot one of the attackers, killing that person, police said. The second attacker ran east from Wal-Mart, and a suspect was arrested by a K-9 team between Maurer and Lackman roads. Sunday evening, police said the wounded Good Samaritan was awake and alert. He was scheduled for surgery later in the day. The infant was not injured. The attack occurred on the east side of the store near the lawn and garden department. A section of the parking lot remained taped off at 4 p.m. A blue tarp, surrounded by orange cones, covered what apparently was the attacker’s body. About a dozen vehicles were inside the taped perimeter. Officers were trying to peer into the windows of one: a maroon SUV with temporary tags. People who were inside the store when the shooting occurred said there was no acknowledgment over the public address system. Jeanne Gardner of Merriam, who was shopping at the time, was unaware of events outside, but said she noticed the store had emptied out. “I’ve never been to Wal-Mart when it was this empty,” she said. She later decided that other customers must have learned about the attack from cellphones and left the store. One store greeter said that as soon as the shooting started, some people ran into the store to get out of the parking lot. The store remained open through the afternoon, but the lawn and garden area was closed. facebook twitter email Share More Videos 0:14 Who kicked this small dog down a flight of stairs?

Whittington Seniors, disabled staying mobile with Dial-A-Ride Dial-A-Ride driver Michelle Davis and Henry Burnett, vice president of operations, prepare for another day at the nonprofit agency's operations center. Photos by Ron P. Whittington For the Times-Union "If we didn't have this, for most of us who don't have our own transportation, we would be lost," Loretta Corraspe says of Dial-A-Ride. The nonprofit transit agency serves Beaches residents. Loretta Corraspe, who lives at Pablo Hamlet just south of Beach Boulevard, is one of more than 450 residents around the Beaches who rely on the nonprofit Dial-A-Ride service for affordable transportation and, more importantly, a level of independence. “If we didn’t have this, for most of us who don’t have our own transportation, we would be lost,” Corraspe said. Started 41 years ago by local ministries at the Beaches that were concerned with the lack of transportation for the elderly, Dial-A-Ride relies on little municipal support to continue operations — offering a round-trip for a “suggested” $5 donation from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays for the elderly and disabled Beaches residents who need it. Dial-A-Ride provides between 2,000 to 3,000 trips annually, operating in a 15-mile radius around the Beaches area from Mayport south to Solano Road in Ponte Vedra — with occasional trips to the Walmart Store on Hodges Boulevard. Calls for transportation outside its service area are referred to Connexion, the paratransit service operated by the Jacksonville Transportation Authority. To help supplement the cost to fund Dial-A-Ride’s operations, which is about $65,000 a year, the nonprofit agency also relies on fundraisers — including the upcoming Monday Tasting from 5:30 to 7 p.m. on Sept. 19 at restaurant Table One on A1A North in Ponte Vedra Beach. The following month, the agency’s biggest fundraiser of the year, the Dial-A-Ride Annual Celebration, takes place from 5 to 8 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 22, at the South Beach Community Center, located at 250 South Beach Parkway in Jacksonville Beach. “Every fundraiser that we have is vital,” said Dial-A-Ride board President Kathryn Latham. “The Square One event isn’t our biggest event, but every fundraiser is important. Even though we get some support from the cities, the vast majority of our donations come from private citizens.” Latham, wife of Jacksonville Beach Mayor Charlie Latham, has served on the board since 2014 and is in her second term as board president. “I’ve always had this draw to the elderly and their care. I felt like oftentimes they are forgotten, so it’s really a calling for me,” she said. “When I found out Dial-A-Ride was struggling, I reached out and joined the board and have been involved ever since.” In addition to serving on the board, Latham has reached out to others to get involved — including her neighbor Henry Burnett, a retired engineer and transportation professional who joined the board in 2014 and now serves as vice-president of operations at Dial-A-Ride. “Kathy came over one day and kind of mentioned they needed help and I thought ‘Heck, I’ll give it a shot,’ ” he said. “So, I went before the members and they approved me for the board. Then, about six months later, they put me in charge of managing the office, then the payroll, then recently put me in charge of the entire thing.” Burnett spent 21 years in the Marine Corps as an engineer before retiring from the service, then spent more than 16 years working at various highway construction sites with a company contracted by the Florida Department of Transportation. He received a medical retirement from that company in 2013, joining the Dial-A-Ride effort the following year. Burnett notes that the service faced shutting down completely two years ago because they lacked the funding to keep it going. While the service is in better shape today, he says keeping the donations flowing is “very much an ongoing thing.” Along with Burnett, who wouldn’t accept a salary for the job, Dial-A-Ride has one secretary who works about 10 hours a week and has two drivers for the single, 15-passenger bus it operates. “It doesn’t sound like much, but it costs money to run that bus,” he said. “You’ve got labor costs and maintenance costs as well. Fortunately, the City of Jacksonville Beach helps us by providing all the fuel and provides a certain amount of maintenance each quarter throughout the year — and Atlantic Beach provides us $1,500 a year.” Although their residents are served by Dial-A-Ride, the cities of Neptune Beach and Ponte Vedra Beach don’t provide any financial support for the system. “We get other donations, including grants from the Rotary Club,” Burnett said. “Baptist Beaches Hospital is a big supporter, and the ministries that started the service are still in and help with donations to keep it going. We have a ministerial association lunch once a month most of the year, and all the nonprofits are there because they all help support us.” ON A SHOESTRING Burnett notes that, just like when the service was started 41 years ago, Dial-A-Ride still very much operates on a shoestring budget. “For our event at Table One, we hope to raise $1,500,” he said. “That may not sound like much money, but it’s a lot to us.” Tickets for the Monday Tasting event are $25 each and include two drinks and heavy hors d’oeuvres. For each ticket sold, Dial-A-Ride will receive $20. Tickets for the Dial-A-Ride Annual Celebration in October are $60 per person and include dinner, drinks and live entertainment. Sponsorships are also available at levels from $250 to $2,500, where sponsors receive a specific number of tickets and signage at the event depending on the sponsor level they purchase. People can call (904) 246-1444 to purchase tickets or inquire about sponsorship opportunities still available. “Basically, with this event and others we’re just trying to help cover our operating costs for the service,” Burnett said. “But what we’re trying to do is get enough donations together to purchase another vehicle … a regular van.” Dial-A-Ride’s current bus has tie-downs for two wheelchairs, but Burnett says many of the disabled people they carry aren’t handicapped to the point that they need a wheelchair. “Many of them could ride a regular van and we could provide service to more people,” he said. “We could go further across the ditch as well, but with a bus it’s just not as economical.” Also, it would give them an option if their current bus encountered any mechanical problems. “If the bus goes down, we’re done … and none of our riders can get service until we can get it back on the road,” he said. Burnett says Dial-A-Ride provides transportation but, more importantly, independence for homebound seniors and the disabled in the Beaches neighborhoods. “This is a service these Beaches residents are counting on, and they’ve depended on it for four decades,” he said. “If we lose it, it’s going to be a very traumatic experience for them. Once you can’t drive, you lose your independence. When you lose that, it puts you further into a depression, and that’s the thing we don’t want. We want these people to know that we’re going to be there for them.” For riders like Corraspe, who has depended on Dial-A-Ride since 2000, the service is an essential part of staying connected to the community. “It’s very important to me because I rely on Dial-A-Ride as an affordable way to go to doctor appointments, the post office, bank and the grocery store,” she said. “And the drivers and dispatchers are so nice. It feels like family, so it’s a very, very special blessing for us all. We’re grateful to have this service.” Advertisement Most Popular News Mon, 06/27/2016 - 09:55 Adam Paulraj, 2011-2016: Born with rare disease and abandoned at birth, 'Baby Adam' defied odds Public Safety Mon, 10/10/2016 - 12:15 Blog: Hurricane Matthew News Fri, 10/07/2016 - 01:12 With Hurricane Matthew nearing Northeast Florida, authorities tell residents to ‘stay home’ Metro Wed, 11/02/2016 - 18:53 Jacksonville Suns changing name to Jumbo Shrimp   View all Local Store Sales » Advertisement More Tiffanie Reynolds Brown to lead Neptune Beach; Jacksonville Beach mayor and council incumbents re-elected Tiffanie Reynolds Piece of old Palm Valley finds home with Beaches Museum Jackie Rooney The annual struggle to get holiday lights up Jackie Rooney End of Daylight Saving Time doesn’t mean more sleep Load more   Contact Us Privacy Policy Terms of Service About Our Ads Advertise with Times-Union Media Jacksonville News, Sports and Entertainment | jacksonville.com © 2016.

Johns Hopkins School of Medicine Share Share via Emailemail Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Three years ago, Geoff Baird bought a drone. The Seattle dad and hobby plane enthusiast used the 2.5-pound quadcopter to photograph the Hawaiian coastline and film his son's soccer and baseball games. But his big hope is that drones will soon fly tubes of blood and other specimens to Harborview Medical Center, where he works as a clinical pathologist running the hospital's chemistry and toxicology labs. In the near future, Baird and others say, drones could transform health care — not only in rural areas by bringing critical supplies into hard-to-reach places, but also in crowded cities where hospitals pay hefty fees to get medical samples across town during rush hour. By providing a faster, cheaper way to move test specimens, drones could speed diagnoses and save lives. "It's superexciting to me," Baird says. The technology seems to be there. Drones are delivering pizza in New Zealand and taking condoms to parts of Ghana that lack reliable roads or access to birth control. Tech giants and big retailers, including Amazon and Wal-Mart, are testing drones for deliveries and pickups. However, "blood specimens are not like a book or a shoe," Timothy Amukele, an assistant professor of pathology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, said in a TED talk earlier this year. No one knew whether bumpy flights would hurt cells or otherwise make biological samples unsuitable for lab tests. Drones In Flight Amukele and his colleagues transport donated blood samples by drone in this video. The drones climbed to over 328 feet above ground and orbited the field for 6 to 38 minutes. https://player.vimeo.com/video/123492106?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0 So Amukele and co-workers conducted several experiments to find out. In their first study, published in PLOS ONE last July, the team collected several hundred blood samples from healthy volunteers. They drove the samples to a flight field an hour northwest of Baltimore, packed half of them into foam containers and flew them around in a drone for up to 40 minutes. The other samples sat. All specimens went back to the lab for 33 routine tests. The results were the same for each group, suggesting samples stay intact during drone flights. In follow-up analyses, drone transport also seemed safe for samples containing microbes and for donated blood. The microbial study was published in August in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology; a manuscript on the blood products study is under review. (Videos of each experiment can be found here.) "The results don't surprise me," says Bill Remillard, chief technical officer at TriCore Reference Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M. "But until you do the science, you just don't know." TriCore handles nearly three quarters of New Mexico's clinical lab testing. And in a sparsely populated state, moving samples over large distances is expensive. TriCore spends $3.5 million per year. So after Remillard heard the results of Amukele's first drone experiment at a meeting last summer, the two started discussing a possible pilot study using drones to transport lab samples in New Mexico. While Amukele's experiments show it's feasible to move lab specimens with drones, pilot studies in real clinical settings are still needed to work out logistics. Questions include how to request a drone, where it would land, who would pick up the samples and how often a drone would need new batteries. Safety is another concern. Some drones drop cargo with parachutes or other release mechanisms, making it harder for people to tamper with the vehicles. But as far as how safe drones are, "those data don't yet exist," Amukele says. Though millions of drones have been sold worldwide, "we don't know how many crashes happen and how many are due to operator error," he says. The Federal Aviation Administration is starting to collect this data. It's a promising development for an industry where legislation has lagged behind the fast-advancing technology. For years, the FAA had imposed a near-ban on commercial drones, only allowing them to fly if businesses applied for an exemption. But in June the agency announced a set of rules for companies to operate drones in the United States, and on Aug. 29 those regulations took effect. The FAA expects the number of registered commercial drones to jump 30-fold, from 20,000 to 600,000, within months. "The rules had not been well defined. This is an attempt to define them," says Lawrence Williams, who heads business development at Zipline, a Silicon Valley startup making drones for medical applications. Zipline is focusing much of its effort in Rwanda, where less crowded skies, relative to the U.S., make it easier to negotiate drone delivery of blood samples. Another drone startup, Vayu, whose CEO is a co-author on the PLOS ONE drone study, is also dipping into the international arena. In July, the Michigan-based company did a demo flight in Madagascar, carrying specimens from a remote village to a lab for testing. Vayu makes a quadricopter plane capable of vertical takeoff — an appealing feature for hospitals with limited landing space. While it's easy to see how drones could improve health care in poor countries, Amukele thinks medical drone delivery could make a bigger splash in the U.S. Compared to Africa and other developing countries, the U.S. does much more testing per person, he says, and many of the country's 200,000 medical labs are collection-only sites that rely on central labs for testing. So "there are likely to be more [medical drone users] in the U.S. than anywhere else," Amukele says. As Zipline prepares to launch blood delivery drones in Rwanda, the company is also seeking regulatory approval for three projects using drones to bring medical supplies to underserved communities in the U.S. One project would integrate drone delivery of medications with telemedicine appointments at a small clinic in rural Maryland. Another would use Zipline drones to link a large health care distribution center to hospitals and tribal clinics around Reno, Nev. And for the third project, the company would partner with a regional blood bank in Washington state, creating a plan to distribute blood to various hospitals and clinics in the event of earthquakes and other natural disasters. Johns Hopkins was initially skeptical of Amukele's experiments — the review board thought his first proposal was a joke — but now the university is giving the pathologist space and funds to hire a drone engineer and continue researching medical delivery drones. In Seattle, Baird is working with Amukele and aeronautical engineers at the University of Washington on their own drone proposal. Ideally their test flights would take samples from Seattle Children's to Harborview, a bustling facility that runs thousands of tests each day. However, that flight path would violate the FAA rule requiring drones to stay within the pilot's line of sight. So the initial plan is to run 2-mile line-of-sight flights between the children's hospital and UW Medical Center, Baird says. Drones could be a huge help in poison emergencies, Baird says. In a typical scenario, a child gets rushed to the emergency room after accidentally swallowing some pills. Though routine tests can rule out some things, clinics often send samples to a centralized toxicology lab for confirmation and further testing. This can take hours. A drone could zip samples downtown in 5 to 10 minutes, Baird says, helping a child get diagnosed and receive medications more quickly. He also envisions drones collecting samples from patients' homes and bringing them to the hospital. You could prick your finger and rub the blood onto a card that a drone could fly back to the lab for testing, Baird says. In the meantime, though, Zipline's U.S. projects remain on hold, awaiting the regulatory go-ahead, and the Seattle team continues studying maps and sketching flight routes for the small drone test it hopes to launch. The team has presented the plan to grant agencies and gotten positive responses — but no funding yet. Like other technological advances, Baird suspects drones for medicine will "wait, wait, wait and then go very quickly."

The fashion retail is trying to woo younger shoppers and imbue the Hilfiger name with the coolness it once enjoyed. File picture: Mike Segar New York - The moment the superfamous began filing onto Pier 16 at New York's South Street Seaport on Friday, it was obvious Tommy Hilfiger's fall fashion show was about so much more than the clothes - if it were even about the clothes at all. Bulbs flashed early as Taylor Swift and her supermodel squad member Martha Hunt glided to their seats, perching next to Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton. Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner followed. The producers cranked up the lights and music, and Gigi Hadid came out blazing in a navy-and-white jacket and leather pants. Spectators jostled, craning for a good Instagram angle. If the idea was to attract attention, it worked.     The first look from @gigihadid set the #TOMMYNOW runway on 🔥Did you see the #TOMMYXGIGI show? Go to tom.my/now to see every moment ✨#NYFW A photo posted by Tommy Hilfiger (@tommyhilfiger) on Sep 9, 2016 at 5:38pm PDT   The extravaganza was part of a hype train meant to woo younger shoppers and imbue the Hilfiger name with the coolness it once enjoyed. Much of the brand's lustre from the 1990s has faded, pushed aside by indie brands, internet upstarts, and fast-fashion stores as shoppers demanded individuality over mass-market normality. Tommy Hilfiger has done well abroad in recent years by exporting classic American style to Europe and Asia, where its retail shops are thriving. Not so at home. Its North American business hasn't posted positive comparative store sales for eight straight quarters. At one point, Hilfiger even considered selling its clothes at Wal-Mart.     Always look forward. Always support the ones you love. Front and center at #TOMMYNOW for @GigiHadid: Her beautiful mama @Yolanda.Hadid, her lil bro @AnwarHadid & her soul-quad @TaylorSwift & @MarthaHunt #TOMMYXGIGI 💕#NYFW A photo posted by Tommy Hilfiger (@tommyhilfiger) on Sep 9, 2016 at 9:02pm PDT   For Friday's show, the label, owned by Calvin Klein and Izod parent PVH Corporation, had built a carnival on the pier. The Tommy Pier, as the brand dubbed it, marked a new era of fashion show, a commercial event staged for both industry insiders and the public. Fashion VIPs packed half the catwalk; general-admission attendees filed into the other after waiting in line to score a spot. Food stands churned out lobster rolls, hot dogs, and fries. Guests got their nails done, pasted on temporary tattoos, played carnival games, or hopped on rides. And, of course, there were the the new designs - a capsule collection in collaboration with the 21-year-old Hadid. Red, white, blue, and nautical styles ruled the runway as the models walked the lengthy wooden aisle, with Rihanna and Skrillex songs belted into the night sky. The clothes, though mostly casual, managed to bridge levels of formality, from cherry red tracksuits to long, sheer cocktail dresses. They were safe, wearable, and available to buy immediately - not six months later, as the traditional fashion calendar demands. Still, amid the overwhelming spectacle, it was hard to concentrate on the clothes, as the women strode past the Ferris wheel under dangling lights. This was no mere launch party for a new line. Hadid is signed as Tommy Hilfiger's global ambassador, and PVH plans to build its women's business around her. That business now accounts for just 25 percent of Hilfiger's sales; executives want to pull that ratio closer to 50 percent. “It's also a part of an overall marketing strategy to build up our women's business globally,” Emanuel Chirico, chief executive officer of PVH, said of the Hadid event at a conference last month. “We think it's a huge opportunity.” Fashion shows were once insider affairs, a place for magazine editors to critique clothes for future issues and for retail buyers to decide which designs they'd put on store shelves. All these things still happen, but at shows like Tommy Hilfiger's, everything - including the clothes - seems secondary to celebrity. In a social media era marked by instant access and shareability, labels are now finding ways to include the public, whether by letting people attend shows in person or by streaming them online.     So much love between @GigiHadid and @TaylorSwift ! Amazing moments from the #TOMMYNOW runway last night. #TOMMYXGIGI #NYFW A photo posted by Tommy Hilfiger (@tommyhilfiger) on Sep 10, 2016 at 10:08am PDT   Hadid is the centrepiece of this US revival effort, using the Tommy x Gigi collection to get young people aboard in a hurry. Compare the Hilfiger fashion show with her usual appearances: A day before, Tom Ford snuck her into the middle of his presentation. And when Victoria's Secret last year picked her to show off its casual Pink line geared at young women, it slotted her like any other model. But the Hilfiger show was a full-on collaboration, with ballyhoo from both parties for more than nine months. It was about her as much as Hilfiger - perhaps because the label needs her more than she needs it. Hadid gives it instant credibility and exposure among her legions of young fans. “She has an amazing sense of style, but at the same time as being a supermodel, she's probably the most important social media star in the world,” Hilfiger, the designer, said on ABC's Good Morning America the morning before the show. On Friday night, once the last models were off the pier and the congregation had been herded to the exits, gawkers and paparazzi awaited the celebrities outside. A mob of teens - and adults, for that matter - squealed and rushed to get a glimpse of Swift as she squeezed into a black SUV. ⚓️ Presenting! A special collection by Gigi Hadid & Tommy Hilfiger ✨ Online in Europe NOW. Countdown begins for everywhere else - Sept 9 💋 Link in bio to shop or explore all things #TOMMYXGIGI A video posted by Tommy Hilfiger (@tommyhilfiger) on Aug 31, 2016 at 10:25pm PDT As she was whisked away, they turned their gaze to Hadid, now scrambling across the street as a logjam of drivers honked at the holdup. Two frantic parents yelled for their child, who'd scurried off for a closer look in the chaos. And the crowd, weaving through cars, chased Hadid onto the seaport cobblestones until she ducked into a building. They all wanted a piece of Gigi Hadid. Hilfiger hopes they'll want a piece of Tommy, too.

Customers will be able to request carts with a "user interface device," such as a smartphone, and the roaming motors will fetch a cart for a customer. The system will also be able to recognize unattended carts inside a store or in the store's parking lot and return it to a docking station, the filing said.  Another feature, according to the patent, would allow the system to receive requests for different items and then send the motorized unit to store shelves to see if the product is there.  It's unclear when Walmart plans to implement the system.  View Comments 0 Sign up for e-newsletters Want more news?

Yes, mall traffic is down, but these retailers are welcoming more shoppers CNBC 9/13/2016 Krystina Gustafson © Provided by CNBC Free yoga classes. Interactive cooking tutorials. Virtual reality mirrors. Quotes in the article TJX Companies Inc TJX ▼ 76.69 -0.41 -0.53% The Home Depot Inc HD ▼ 128.64 -0.29 -0.22% Visa Inc V ▲ 81.37 +0.30 +0.37% Dollar Tree Inc DLTR ▼ 81.33 -0.32 -0.39% With foot traffic continuing down a slippery slide, retailers are finding creative ways to get consumers into their stores. Yet not all bricks-and-mortar players have seen their traffic dissipate at the expense of online shopping. Instead, a handful of retailers have managed to keep consumers filing into their shops. Whether it's by improving their in-store experience, constantly changing the merchandise or simply having an in-demand item, these retailers have defied the industry trend. Wal-Mart (WMT)'s U.S. business is in the midst of a major turnaround. The division recorded its seventh-straight traffic increase during the latest quarter, helping boost its same-store sales 1.6 percent. Shoppers have responded to the company's work to keep more items in stock, sell fresher produce, and speed up the time spent waiting at the checkout counter. © Provided by CNBC The burgeoning beauty retailer is in growth mode. In addition to cutting the ribbon on 100 new stores by the end of its fiscal year, Ulta (ULTA) has a number of traffic-driving measures in place. They include adding new brands to its shelves, growing its loyalty program and incorporating salon services into its shops. © Provided by CNBC The merchandise mix at T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods is constantly changing — giving consumers a reason to visit often. An increase in footfall was the main driver behind their parent company TJX (TJX)'s 4 percent same-store sales gain in the second quarter. It was the seventh-straight three-month period that traffic powered its comparable-sales increase, CEO Ernie Herrman said. © Provided by CNBC Like TJX, fellow off-price retailer Ross Stores (ROST) offers shoppers a treasure hunt experience. During the latest quarter, its 4 percent same-store sales gain was driven by an increase in both traffic and the average number of items in each shopper's basket. © Provided by CNBC Though Burlington (BURL) is the smallest of the three major off-price chains, it too logged another quarter of traffic growth in the recently ended three-month period. The company has recorded positive traffic in seven of the last eight quarters. © Provided by CNBC Thanks to a solid housing market, the world's largest home improvement retailer has seen a lift from consumers funneling money into their living spaces. Home Depot (HD) has also finetuned its in-store execution, including an ability to change up its merchandise to respond to weather trends. The number of customer transactions, often used as a proxy for traffic, rose at Home Depot during the fiscal second quarter. © Provided by CNBC Given its membership-based model, Costco (COST)'s shoppers are some of the most loyal. Even as the pace of its traffic growth has slowed modestly this year, it's still on the rise. The warehouse retailer has been grappling with lower gas prices, foreign exchange headwinds and a transition away from American Express (AXP) to Visa (V)-branded credit cards. The major dollar stores just reported one of their weakest quarters in recent memory. Yet with Dollar Tree (DLTR)'s comparable sales still rose 1.2 percent, with an increase in foot traffic contributing to its gain. © Provided by CNBC There are only a few products consumers are willing to line up for. On a conference call with analysts last month, Foot Locker (FL) CEO Dick Johnson said the sneakers sold in his stores are some of them. The executive likened major footwear launches to the buzz around major Apple (AAPL) debuts. They're a key reason why sluggish mall traffic isn't a big concern for his company, he said. © Provided by CNBC American Eagle (AEO)'s lingerie brand refuses to Photoshop the young women in its ads. That body-positive message has been well received among shoppers, contributing to the label's 24 percent same-store sales increase during the second quarter. A rise in traffic contributed to that growth. © Provided by CNBC Michaels (MIK) last month lowered its comparable-sales forecast for the current fiscal year. Yet the crafting retailer, which has seen a lift from the do-it-yourself movement, still managed to grow its traffic during the second quarter. © Provided by CNBC Go to MSN Home More in Money 12 leaders who took $1 salaries Money What Trump's win could mean for older Americans CBS News 30 things you should never buy without a coupon GOBankingRates 6 brand mascots that actually existed in real life Business Insider 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney Up Next 15 of the biggest business disasters of all time Lovemoney AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from CNBC CNBC View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Academy Bank will formally celebrate the opening of its new prototype bank facility in Fairway on Sept 21. The flagship full-service bank at 4400 Shawnee Mission Parkway marks a departure for the firm. Previously, its outlets have been located in Walmart Super Centers, said CEO Paul Holewinski. “This is our first step with a more traditional retail banking center,” he said. “We’ll have new technology available that allows extended hours and drive throughs.” Holewinski said Fairway was chosen for its new location because of its great demographics and the high visibility of the address. “There’s a lot of redevelopment and its a growing area for small business clients,” he said. The six-person staff will include mortgage and small business specialists. The bank has been open since May 23. The ribbon-cutting ceremony hosted by the Northeast Johnson County Chamber of Commerce from 4:30- to 6:30 p.m. will be an opportunity for the public to tour the space and enjoy refreshments.

That's because her family's Blue Cross Blue Shield health plan requires that they meet a $5,200 deductible before insurance coverage kicks in, a figure they haven't reached yet for the year. That left Traverso on the hook for the full price—and she couldn't afford to fill the prescription. "I'm angry. This is not something you want to have. It's something you have to have," says Traverso. She says she'll consider not using her insurance and switching to the cheaper EpiPen alternative, generic Adrenaclick ($140 at Walmart using a GoodRx.com coupon). Taylor Berg, of Chicago, faces a similar situation: This year she worried that her plan's $5,000 deductible would leave her on the hook for the full price of her EpiPen. Fortunately for Berg, since she has already reached her deductible, she has paid nothing out of pocket for the EpiPen. Still, Berg admits, it's sometimes a struggle to reach her annual deductible. "I don't meet the 5K mark every year. It's not an ideal situation."  High-deductible health plans that require a person to pay a large sum out of pocket—$1,000 or more—before insurance coverage kicks in have become increasingly common. In fact, almost half of all Americans who get their insurance through their employer have one, according to a recent survey from Kaiser Family Foundation. And that percentage has jumped dramatically—in 2009 just 8 percent of people were covered by this kind of insurance. Although having a higher deductible can mean you pay a lower monthly premium price, you can get also stuck with higher costs until you meet that deductible. Low Premiums Don’t Always Add Up to Low Costs When Mylan raised the price of EpiPen, they attributed the increase to changes in the health "insurance landscape" as more and more people are enrolled in high-deductible health plans. But Clare Krusing, spokeswoman for America's Health Insurance Plans, a national trade organization for the insurance industry, says Mylan's rationale is "absolutely false" and calls it a "move to distract from the company's price increase." High-deductible health plans, which are also referred to as "consumer-directed health plans," are based on the idea that consumers shouldering more financial responsibility will make smarter healthcare decisions. The plans might be accompanied by a tax-advantaged health savings account used to pay medical expenses, in the form of an HSA (health savings account) or an HRA (health reimbursement arrangements). "The plans can be an affordable option for some," says Krusing. "For instance, if you’re someone who prefers a low monthly premium, and you don’t anticipate a great deal of medical costs up front, a higher-deductible plan may work for you."   In response, Mylan spokeswoman Julie Knell told us, "We regret that our programs did not keep pace with the evolving healthcare system, and, as a result, some patients are facing out-of-pocket costs that were never intended, potentially leading to stress upon them and their families." Knell adds that while "previously a patient may have paid a $25 co-pay for a prescription regardless of the product cost, today, with a high-deductible health plan, they must pay the full product cost, which they may have previously been unaware of, until their deductible is reached." For many, the lower-premium plans can mean fewer options and higher prices for things they have no choice about—EpiPens, for example. "The inherent tradeoff in high-deductible health plans is lower monthly premiums," says Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at Kaiser Family Foundation working on health reform and private insurance issues. "For individuals who don’t get sick, that tradeoff can work, but if sudden illness or injury strikes, monthly premium savings can be more than offset by your out-of-pocket expenses." And while HDHPs are supposed to steer consumers away from low-value care, such as overused tests and treatments, the plans don't necessarily make consumers better shoppers of healthcare, and, worse, can also lead people to cutting back on needed care. That's according to recent research by Consumers Union, the policy and mobilization arm of Consumer Reports.  A 2014 Commonwealth Fund survey found something similar: Two in five adults with a deductible that was high relative to their income reported delaying needed care, including not filling a prescription and skipping a medical test, because of the out-of-pocket costs associated with their deductible. "Consumers deserve to have timely, actionable price and quality information on treatments and providers, but we shouldn't expect it to make our markets work better," says Lynn Quincy, the director of the Health Care Value Hub for Consumers Union. "We need to use different approaches to really bring down the underlying cost of healthcare." What to Do Now If you use a high-deductible insurance plan, keeping your prices manageable means understanding your plan's benefit design up front. Your plan's Summary of Benefits will explain how cost sharing works for each covered benefit. Here are five more ways to save on your care and medications:  Take advantage of preventive services. Many high-deductible plans feature little to no out-of-pocket costs for preventive screenings and office visits—something that many consumers on HDHPs may not know, according to a 2012 Health Affairs study. Consider paying out of pocket. Some medications might cost less if you pay without using insurance. That's because many chain and big-box stores offer hundreds of common generics at prices as low as $4 for a 30-day supply and $10 for a 90-day supply for people who pay out of pocket. (Note that most discount programs are open to people with Medicare, Medicaid, or Tricare insurance.) Keep in mind that if you do bypass your insurance and pay the retail price, money spent on your prescription won’t count toward your deductible or out-of-pocket maximums.  Shop around. Many insurers provide pricing tools and calculators on their websites that can help make it easier to compare costs within your network. And since prices for medications can vary from one pharmacy to the next, before filling a prescription, call several pharmacies and ask for the lowest possible price. Also check GoodRx.com to learn its “fair price” and use that to negotiate if a pharmacist quotes you a higher price. Skip care and drugs you don't need. Doctors often prescribe drugs or order tests you don't need. For example, you rarely need antibiotics if you have bronchitis, a sore throat, or a sinus infection. Those drugs won't help you feel better, and what's worse, can promote the spread of superbugs. See our Choosing Wisely materials to learn about when to question tests, treatments, and drugs.   Do your research during open enrollment. When it comes to shopping for a new plan during your open enrollment period, don't wait until the last minute—and don't rush to the cheapest plan. Give yourself ample time to compare coverage options and choose a plan that covers the health services and medications you need. If you opt for a high-deductible plan, consider an HSA that allows you to cover out-of-pocket costs with money set aside in a tax-free account.

Gigi Hadid has partnered with Tommy Hilfiger to launch the Tommy x Gigi collection. The brand's carnival-themed fall fashion show took place Sept. 10 in New York City.  (Larry Busacca / GETTY IMAGES)   By Kim BhasinBloomberg Tues., Sept. 13, 2016 The moment the superfamous began filing onto Pier 16 at New York’s South Street Seaport on Friday, it was obvious Tommy Hilfiger’s fall fashion show was about so much more than the clothes — if it were even about the clothes at all. Bulbs flashed early as Taylor Swift and her supermodel-squad member Martha Hunt glided to their seats, perching next to Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton. Kardashian matriarch Kris Jenner followed. The producers cranked up the lights and music, and Gigi Hadid came out blazing in a navy-and-white jacket and leather pants. Spectators jostled, craning for a good Instagram angle. If the idea was to attract attention, it worked. The extravaganza was part of a hype train meant to woo younger shoppers and imbue the Hilfiger name with the coolness it once enjoyed. Much of the brand’s lustre from the 1990s has faded, pushed aside by indie brands, internet upstarts and fast-fashion stores as shoppers demand individuality over mass-market normality. Tommy Hilfiger has done well abroad in recent years by exporting classic American style to Europe and Asia, where its retail shops are thriving. Article Continued Below Not so at home. Its North American business hasn’t posted positive comparative store sales for eight straight quarters. At one point, Hilfiger even considered selling its clothes at Wal-Mart. For Friday’s show, the label, owned by Calvin Klein and Izod parent PVH Corp., had built a carnival on the pier. The Tommy Pier, as the brand dubbed it, marked a new era of fashion show, a commercial event staged for both industry insiders and the public. Fashion VIPs packed half the catwalk; general-admission attendees filed into the other after waiting in line to score a spot. Food stands churned out lobster rolls, hot dogs and fries. Guests got their nails done, pasted on temporary tattoos, played carnival games or hopped on rides. And, of course, there were the new designs — a capsule collection in collaboration with the 21-year-old Hadid. Red, white, blue and nautical styles ruled the runway as the models walked the lengthy wooden aisle, with Rihanna and Skrillex songs belted into the night sky. The clothes, though mostly casual, managed to bridge levels of formality, from cherry red tracksuits to long, sheer cocktail dresses. They were safe, wearable and available to buy immediately — not six months later, as the traditional fashion calendar demands. Still, amid the overwhelming spectacle, it was hard to concentrate on the clothes, as the women strode past the ferris wheel under dangling lights. This was no mere launch party for a new line. Hadid is signed as Tommy Hilfiger’s global ambassador, and PVH plans to build its women’s business around her. That business now accounts for just 25 per cent of Hilfiger’s sales; executives want to pull that ratio closer to 50 per cent. “It’s also a part of an overall marketing strategy to build up our women’s business globally,” Emanuel Chirico, chief executive officer of PVH, said of the Hadid event at a conference last month. “We think it’s a huge opportunity.” Fashion shows were once insider affairs, a place for magazine editors to critique clothes for future issues and for retail buyers to decide which designs they’d put on store shelves. All these things still happen, but at shows like Tommy Hilfiger’s, everything — including the clothes — seems secondary to celebrity. In a social media era marked by instant access and shareability, labels are now finding ways to include the public, whether by letting people attend shows in person or by streaming them online. Hadid is the centrepiece of this U.S. revival effort, using the Tommy x Gigi collection to get young people aboard in a hurry. Compare the Hilfiger fashion show with her usual appearances: A day before, Tom Ford sneaked her into the middle of his presentation. And when Victoria’s Secret last year picked her to show off its casual Pink line geared at young women, it slotted her like any other model. But the Hilfiger show was a full-on collaboration, with ballyhoo from both parties for more than nine months. It was about her as much as Hilfiger -perhaps because the label needs her more than she needs it. Hadid gives it instant credibility and exposure among her legions of young fans. “She has an amazing sense of style, but at the same time as being a supermodel, she’s probably the most important social media star in the world,” Hilfiger, the designer, said on ABC’s Good Morning America the morning before the show. On Friday night, once the last models were off the pier and the congregation had been herded to the exits, gawkers and paparazzi awaited the celebrities outside. A mob of teens — and adults, for that matter — squealed and rushed to get a glimpse of Swift as she squeezed into a black SUV. As she was whisked away, they turned their gaze to Hadid, now scrambling across the street as a logjam of drivers honked at the holdup. Two frantic parents yelled for their child, who’d scurried off for a closer look in the chaos. And the crowd, weaving through cars, chased Hadid onto the seaport cobblestones until she ducked into a building. They all wanted a piece of Gigi Hadid. Hilfiger hopes they’ll want a piece of Tommy, too. The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

During her appearance on the Rachael Ray Show, she explained how she was bullied as a child and works hard to ensure none of her students are excluded, especially for socioeconomic reasons preventing them from having school supplies.

"My kids need to know who this is," the teacher said.

It was the first time the two had seen each other since the line at Walmart. There were teary eyes all around.  "I thought, 'somebody else cares about my babies,'" Drude said on the show.

Interactive cooking tutorials. Virtual reality mirrors. With foot traffic continuing down a slippery slide, retailers are finding creative ways to get consumers into their stores. Yet not all bricks-and-mortar players have seen their traffic dissipate at the expense of online shopping. Instead, a handful of retailers have managed to keep consumers filing into their shops. Whether it's by improving their in-store experience, constantly changing the merchandise or simply having an in-demand item, these retailers have defied the industry trend. Wal-Mart Lucas Jackson | Reuters Shoppers look at merchandise at a Walmart store in Secaucus, New Jersey. Wal-Mart's U.S. business is in the midst of a major turnaround. The division recorded its seventh-straight traffic increase during the latest quarter, helping boost its same-store sales 1.6 percent. Shoppers have responded to the company's work to keep more items in stock, sell fresher produce, and speed up the time spent waiting at the checkout counter. Ulta Jesse Grant | Getty Images ULTA Beauty The burgeoning beauty retailer is in growth mode. In addition to cutting the ribbon on 100 new stores by the end of its fiscal year, Ulta has a number of traffic-driving measures in place. They include adding new brands to its shelves, growing its loyalty program and incorporating salon services into its shops. TJX David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images TJ Maxx store The merchandise mix at T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods is constantly changing — giving consumers a reason to visit often. An increase in footfall was the main driver behind their parent company TJX's 4 percent same-store sales gain in the second quarter. It was the seventh-straight three-month period that traffic powered its comparable-sales increase, CEO Ernie Herrman said. Ross Stores Gary Friedman | Los Angeles Times | Getty Images Ross Dress for Less Like TJX, fellow off-price retailer Ross Stores offers shoppers a treasure hunt experience. During the latest quarter, its 4 percent same-store sales gain was driven by an increase in both traffic and the average number of items in each shopper's basket. Burlington Lou Rocco | ABC | Getty Images Burlington Coat Factory Though Burlington is the smallest of the three major off-price chains, it too logged another quarter of traffic growth in the recently ended three-month period. The company has recorded positive traffic in seven of the last eight quarters. Home Depot Getty Images Customers shop at a Home Depot store in Chicago, Illinois. Thanks to a solid housing market, the world's largest home improvement retailer has seen a lift from consumers funneling money into their living spaces. Home Depot has also finetuned its in-store execution, including an ability to change up its merchandise to respond to weather trends. The number of customer transactions, often used as a proxy for traffic, rose at Home Depot during the fiscal second quarter. Costco Daniel Acker | Bloomberg | Getty Images Employees load a customers purchases into a shopping cart at a Costco store in East Peoria, Illinois. Given its membership-based model, Costco's shoppers are some of the most loyal. Even as the pace of its traffic growth has slowed modestly this year, it's still on the rise. The warehouse retailer has been grappling with lower gas prices, foreign exchange headwinds and a transition away from American Express to Visa-branded credit cards. Dollar Tree Vince Talotta | Getty Images The major dollar stores just reported one of their weakest quarters in recent memory. Yet with Dollar Tree's comparable sales still rose 1.2 percent, with an increase in foot traffic contributing to its gain. Foot Locker Patrick T. Fallon | Bloomberg | Getty Images There are only a few products consumers are willing to line up for. On a conference call with analysts last month, Foot Locker CEO Dick Johnson said the sneakers sold in his stores are some of them. The executive likened major footwear launches to the buzz around major Apple debuts. They're a key reason why sluggish mall traffic isn't a big concern for his company, he said. Aerie David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images Aerie, by American Eagle Outfitters American Eagle's lingerie brand refuses to Photoshop the young women in its ads. That body-positive message has been well received among shoppers, contributing to the label's 24 percent same-store sales increase during the second quarter. A rise in traffic contributed to that growth. Michaels Luke Sharrett | Bloomberg | Getty Images Michaels employee Michaels last month lowered its comparable-sales forecast for the current fiscal year. Yet the crafting retailer, which has seen a lift from the do-it-yourself movement, still managed to grow its traffic during the second quarter.

But then we know that already, with the recent Apple tax break in Ireland being a prime example of a government having to bow down to the might of a super global brand with a bulging wallet. The idea of corporations becoming entities above the law and exempt from the international laws in place for "the rest of us" must be taken seriously, as profit margins continue to rise for the power-house corporates, whilst EU states and countries outside struggle to mange their national books on behalf of the nations they are representing. 69 of top 100 economic entities are corporations not countries. https://t.co/mZPbk0aF5z pic.twitter.com/EDuLwdlET0 — Global Justice Now (@GlobalJusticeUK) September 12, 2016​ According to the Fortune 500 "Top 10" list of highest earning companies in 2016, Walmart tops the scale at a whopping revenue amount of US$482,130 billion (£365,072 billion GBP). The list also includes globally dominating companies such as Shell, Apple, BP, Exxon Mobil, Toyota Motors and China National Petroleum, who all have a combined revenue of billions, notably more than of 180 countries such as Ireland, Indonesia, Israel, Colombia, Greece, South Africa, Iraq, Vietnam and many more. In what may at first sound like some kind of dystopian premonition for the future, it could one day become common for a government to rely even more on corporations and for absolutely everything in society to be privatized.

Even Britain's former PM David Cameron was found to have benefited from offshore tax haven savings, thus making it not unsurprising that the government is able to easily turn a blind eye to considerable tax break possibilities of some of the biggest corporations in the world. © Photo: Andy Hall/Oxfam London's Trafalgar Square transformed into an interactive, tropical tax haven by Oxfam, Action Aid and Christian Aid. / In addition to the financial clout achieved by some of the world's biggest corporations, there is another quite serious concern — big brands choosing to focus on profit-margins over equally important, if not even more so, areas such as ethical working conditions, environmental destruction and issues affecting climate change. The Sports Direct brand in the UK have very recently been forced to address their draconian working conditions. Oil spills and environmental consequences of profiteering big businesses as well as the countless other unethical practices ignored due to the might of the corporates are regularly uncovered by campaign groups and journalists around the world.  Protest staged at Stoke Newington Sports Direct over working conditions https://t.co/46zJG4ku2K #London pic.twitter.com/bRsxLLRpdo — London News (@DaiIyLONDON) September 5, 2016​ Have we come too far now to be able to make a U-turn on the power, globally dominating corporations, have over societies? Campaign groups such as Global Justice Now have launched a petition, advocating the UN Human Rights Council to call on governments to begin work on developing a set of legally-binding rules for transnational corporations and reign in the extent of largely uncontrolled power they may have as a result of their revenues. A set of rules in place to ensure corporations do not simply focus on profits before ethical practices and international laws. Corporations running the world used to be science fiction — Now it's a reality. https://t.co/3DX30ZumJ7 — Global Justice Now (@GlobalJusticeUK) September 12, 2016​ There are a number of trade organizations such as the Ethical Trading Initiative, which hold some of the biggest brands to account. Or campaign bodies such as Labour Behind The Label, for example, which focus on the fashion industry and also encouraging accountability from brands and reminding everyone, including governments, of the importance of doing so.  In the mean time, the profits and power of the big brands continue to rise… ...

The marriage of corporate interests and government at least in the United States is a very sobering reality for most average citizens. The government no longer serves the people but is subservient to corporate interests ushering in the era of anything goes Capitalism leaving populations at the mercy of corporate greed and their fanatical need for control of markets. The citizens of the world have become mere dupes in the great corporate swindles perpetrated by these parasites on humanity. Capitalism as a social and economic system must be scraped, not to do so will ensure the enslavement of the entire human race to the race for quarterly profits at any cost. Capitalism is no more than a pyramid scheme to entice consumption of fast dwindling resources and the enslavement of humanity to a subsistence existence. Given free rein Capitalism will lead humanity back to the stone ages.

More national industries have launched a sustainable roundtable or advisory board, and an international organization focused on sustainable beef will meet next month in Alberta. More food companies say that they are taking steps to ensure that their supply chains are mitigating their impacts on people and the environment. But according to the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), the world’s largest producers, retailers and restaurant chains in the world are not doing enough to decouple the impacts of their business from deforestation. In fact, the UCS report claims that the international beef sector is responsible for twice as much deforestation than palm oil, soy and wood products combined. Much of the ongoing destruction, says UCS, is occurring in South America, where rain forests rich in biodiversity are being cleared and converted into pastureland for cattle. UCS estimates that tropical deforestation is responsible for approximately 10 percent of all global warming emissions, with beef production the largest driver behind this forest loss, especially in South America. Researchers evaluated 13 large companies on a variety of criteria. In turn they developed a scorecard that accounted for whether or not these companies have made zero deforestation sourcing commitments, how transparent their commitments actually are and the degree to which they have systems in place to monitor deforestation. The results, insists UCS, show that even the companies that scored highest on this scorecard are still responsible for an excessive amount of deforestation. Walmart, McDonald’s and Mars Inc. may have made the most progress amongst the world’s largest companies, but UCS faults them for leaving loopholes in their commitments that allow for continued deforestation. The UCS study says these companies have an opportunity to lead even further if they are more public about their implementation and verification systems, and back them up with audits that are disclosed to their stakeholders. And while the Amazon in Brazil often scores the majority of attention, UCS says the country’s savannah-like cerrado is also under siege. The gran chaco region, which is spread across Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia, has also seen more of its forest fall to ranching and agriculture. The problem is particularly acute in Paraguay, where despite anti-deforestation laws that have earned the praise of NGOs in the past, the felling of forests to raise beef is going unchecked – and most beef produced in this inland country is exported. A UCS analysis concluded that over the past five years alone, man-made fires and other deforestation processes led to the release of 1.45 billion metric tons of carbon into the air – the equivalent of the pollution emitted by 211 coal-fired power plants. UCS has harsh criticism for the other companies it evaluated in this survey. Burger King, ConAgra, Hormel, Jack’s Links, Kroger, Pizza Hut, Safeway and Wendy have all been named by UCS for falling short on the public commitments they’ve made to stop deforestation within their supply chains. In order to halt deforestation, UCS is calling for these companies to embrace public-private sector agreements that increase transparency and bolster local environmental laws. Earlier this decade, pressure from Greenpeace led to the G4 agreement, to which four of the largest meatpackers in Brazil agreed to take measures guaranteeing that they not purchase meat from ranchers who have had ties to deforestation. While that agreement has its share of loopholes, the evidence suggests that it has helped to halted the pace of deforestation in the Amazon. But one problem in Brazil and other cattle producing countries is that many cattle are produced by ranches that have indirect ties to meatpacking companies. The nature of ranching is that while it is easy to monitor deforestation and other data from direct cattle suppliers, plenty of cattle are bought and sold, and moved and transferred, from ranch to ranch. And that is where the trouble often starts, as it is difficult for companies and their direct suppliers to gauge whether any environmental (or human rights abuses), have occurred or not. To solve the problem, UCS is launching a campaign today that challenges these companies to decouple deforestation from their sourcing commitment. Saying that they are doing so is not enough: Companies need to guarantee that their beef has no links to deforestation, and can provide the data necessary in order to verify such claims, says UCS. The NGO ran a similar awareness campaign in recent years that highlighted the global palm oil industry’s environmental impact. The result, says UCS, engaged millions of consumers with the result that 26 food companies agreed to purchase only responsibly sourced palm oil with no ties to forest destruction.

Police responded to a shots fired call at the Walmart Superstore and found Rogers in possession of a handgun. No injuries were reported and officials say that one of the reasons that the situation did not escalate was due to the calm manner in which store employees responded to the potentially fatal incident. Moody Air Force Base officials announce the discovery of the body of civilian employee Lisa M. Williams and the effort to determine her cause of death is underway. Williams was unresponsive when found; she is survived by her husband and two daughters.

The various Fed speeches delivered in the near term were biased towards an early tightening before things get out of hand. Although there are no major economic data that have a bearing on monetary policy, yesterday's rebound could put traders on the defensive. Commodities, with the exception of oil, are higher. Oil is down over $1-a-barrel after the API inventory data. The dollar is holding higher. European stocks are seeing nervousness amid a soft German economic sentiment reading.   U.S. stocks bounced back on Monday, recouping part of the previous session's losses, as a relatively dovish message relayed by some Fed speeches and oil's gain supported the markets.    The major averages began on a tentative note but advanced steadily throughout the remainder of the session. The Dow Industrials ended up 239.62 points or 1.32 percent at 18,325, the S&P 500 Index closed 31.23 points or 1.47 percent higher at 2,159 and the Nasdaq Composite closed at 5,212, up 85.98 points or 1.68 percent.    Twenty-nine of the thirty Dow components closed higher for the session but 1 stock retreated. Apple (AAPL), Wal-Mart (WMT), Procter & Gamble (PG), Coca-Cola (KO) and Verizon (VZ) were among the biggest gainers of the session.     Although the buying was broad based, semiconductor, gold and biotechnology stocks were standout performers.    Currency, Commodity Markets   Crude oil futures for October delivery are slipping $1.12 to $45.17 a barrel after ending Monday's session up $0.41 at $46.29 a barrel. Meanwhile, an ounce of gold is currently trading at $1,327.90, up $2.30 from the previous session's close of $1,325.60. On Monday, gold fell $8.90.    On the currency front, the U.S. dollar is trading at 102.25 yen compared to the 101.85 yen it fetched at the close of New York trading on Monday. Against the euro, the dollar is valued at $1.1239 compared to yesterday's $1.1235. Asia   The Asian markets ended mixed amid a slight pullback by the yen, which propped up the Japanese market. The Chinese and South Korean markets also recorded gains. However, some of the markets, that were closed on Monday played catch up to the steep losses in the region yesterday. The Hong Kong, Australian and New Zealand markets rose modestly. The Indian market was closed for a public holiday.     The mixed sentiment came despite the release of promising economic data out of China.     The Nikkei 225 Index opened higher but gave back most of its gains by early afternoon trading. After showing volatility till late afternoon trading, the index rose steadily and consolidated its gains going into the close. The index was up 56.12 points or 0.34 percent at 16,729.    Food, textile, chemical, pharma and most export stocks gained ground, while some housing, retail, real estate, utility and financial stocks came under selling pressure.    Australia's All Ordinaries Index opened higher and rose sharply in early trading but gradually gave back all its gains, dropping below the unchanged line in late trading. The index closed down 9.10 points or 0.17 percent at 5,310.    Energy, financial, telecom and utility stocks were among the worst performers of the session, while material, IT, industrial, healthcare and consumer discretionary stocks moved to the downside.    Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index ended at 23,216, down 74.84 points or 0.32 percent, while China's Shanghai Composite Index ended up 1.53 points or 0.05 percent at 3,024.    On the economic front, a trio of economic reports released by the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics showed that the Chinese economy is up and running. The year-over-year industrial production growth of 6.3 percent for August beat estimates of 6.2 percent and July's rate of 6 percent.    Separate reports also showed Chinese retail sales rose 10.6 percent, ahead of the 10.2 percent increase in July and the consensus estimate of 10.2 percent. Fixed asset investment growth for the January to August period held steady at 8.1 percent, belying expectations for a slowdown to 7.9 percent.    The results of a survey by the National Australia Bank showed that confidence among businesses in Australia improved in August. The corresponding indicators index rose 2 points to 6 in August, while the business conditions index fell 2 points to 7.    Europe   European stocks are higher, although amid some volatility early in the session after a 3-day retreat.     On the economic front, German economic sentiment held unchanged near a four-year low in September compared to expectations for a modest improvement. The ZEW Indicator of economic sentiment came in at 0.5 points in September, unchanged from August. The score was forecast to rise to 2.5 points.   The U.K. Office of National Statistics reported that annual inflation in the U.K. remained stable at 0.6 percent in August, belying expectations for a pick up to 0.7 percent. However, a separate report showed that factory gate prices rose notably. A third report released by the agency showed that house price inflation in the U.K. slowed in July.    Final estimates released by the German Federal Statistical Office showed that German consumer price inflation remained steady at 0.4 percent in August, as initially estimated. The HICP inflation was at 0.3 percent.    U.S. Economic Reports   The Treasury is set to release the results of its auction of 30-year bonds at 1 pm ET.    The Treasury will also release its monthly budgetary statement for August at 2 pm ET. Economists expect the budget deficit to narrow to $105 billion from $112.8 billion in July.   Stocks in Focus   United Natural Foods (UNFI) reported better than expected fourth quarter earnings per share, while its revenues were shy of estimates. The company's full year revenue guidance was positive.  Renesas Electronics said that it agreed to acquire Intersil Corp. (ISIL) for $22.50 per share in cash, representing an aggregate equity value of about US$3.2 billion or about 321.9 billion yen at an exchange rate of 100 yen to the dollar. Apple (AAPL) is getting a lift after T-Mobile (TMUS) said it has received record pre-orders for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus after it was unveiled last Friday.   Sanmina (SANM) announced that its board has authorized the buyback of up to $150 million worth of its shares.    Actions Semiconductor (ACTS) announced a definitive merger agreement to be acquired by a consortium of buyers for $2.20 per ADS, each representing 6 underlying shares.    Weight Watchers (WTW) announced that it is commencing a search for a new CEO, as the incumbent James Chambers has announced his intention to resign, effective September 30th, 2016.

Experts believe that Tesco and Sainsbury's will follow Asda and Morrisons in slashing their prices, resulting in a bargain basement festive season. "We've had three years of food price deflation so far, so it's likely that it could be cheapest Christmas ever," Thomas Wharram, a research associate at Bernstein, said, while warning that prices could rise in the longer term.

The move marks the Bradford-based company's second post-Brexit price reduction after cutting prices on more than 1,000 products by an average of 18% at the start of August. Asda followed suit, with the Walmart-owned company saying it would lower thousands of prices on products including beef, chicken and sausages. "It is fair to think that Tesco and Sainsbury will be next," Nicla Di Palma, an equity analyst at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, said. Asda, Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury's are attempting to fend off the challenge from German upstarts Aldi and Lidl, which have both taken market share from the so-called Big Four.

"The reality is that the UK retail scene very competitive, as supermarket groups try fight back against the damage discounters are doing to them," Black said. "It's going to be a competitive Christmas, and a good Christmas for consumers who tend to benefit when there is intense competition, especially in the battle around fresh foods. "We've seen more from Morrisons, more from Asda, and we expect Tesco to chip away at prices and we don't expect discounters to sit on their hands." poll loading Have you started Christmas shopping yet? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR YES NO Read More Cheaper to FLY to New York than do your Christmas shopping here Prices to rise next year However, there was also a warning that shoppers would be punished in 2017 as a result of the collapse in sterling driving up import costs. "Will it be cheaper than 2015? Probably. Will 2017 be more expensive? If pound remains where it is, certainly," Black said.

The white dot near the top of the arm, just left of the shoulder joint, is a shotgun pellet. Doctors told Everitt it was too deep to remove. [Photo courtesy of Jake Everitt] LAND O'LAKES — What started as a trip to Walmart on Sunday night ended with a shotgun pellet lodged in Jake Everitt's arm. Related News/Archive Man who pulled gun sought in Odessa road rage incident (w/video) 4 Months Ago FHP: Man throws empty salsa jar at car in apparent Polk County road-rage incident 4 Months Ago Man deputies say pulled a gun in Odessa road rage incident turns self in (w/video) 3 Months Ago The 26-year-old was leaning out of the passenger window of his girlfriend's Toyota Prius in the supercenter's parking lot when he said the driver of another vehicle fired a shotgun at him. Now the Pasco County Sheriff's Office is searching for the armed driver involved in what they're calling road rage. "We're just lucky," Everitt said. "If it was a couple inches higher it would went into my neck and I would have been dead." The pellet was lodged so deep, Everitt said, doctors could not remove it. Deputies said the incident started on State Road 54 approaching U.S. 41 at about 10:50 p.m. Everitt and his girlfriend, Kandace Skaff, 28, were on their way to pick up Skaff's daughter at the Land O'Lakes supercenter. Skaff changed lanes to pass a slower car and got behind a sport utility vehicle. Shortly thereafter, Everitt said, the SUV's driver slammed on the breaks to "brake check" Skaff. Everitt said he thought the driver did it because Skaff drove with her high beams on. Her regular headlights don't work very well. "I think that might have (angered) them," Everitt said. Both Skaff and the truck turned into the Walmart parking lot, where the SUV let Skaff pass. At that point, Everitt said, he leaned out the window with his arm to get a look at the SUV. That's when the SUV driver fired at him, Everitt said. Afterward, deputies said the SUV driver sped off using Dale Mabry to escape. The Prius took most of the pellets. The rear window shattered, Everitt said, and he counted 26 pellet holes. "I'm just glad the little girl wasn't in the car," he said, "because it hit right where she sits." Everitt drove himself to Medical Center of Trinity, where doctors could not remove the pellet. "I have to live with it for the rest of my life," he said. SUV driver sought The Pasco County Sheriff's Office is looking for the person who fired a shotgun at another vehicle Sunday night. They said the shooter was driving a dark-colored, older sport utility vehicle with a roof rack. It may have Florida tags. A dark-colored dog sat in the front passenger seat. Crime Stoppers is offering a reward of up to $3,000 for information leading to an arrest.

Voters Oppose Charter School Expansion, And Back Legal Weed04:56 Play September 13, 2016 By Fred Thys Share Likely voters oppose a ballot initiative to expand the number of charter schools in Massachusetts. That's the finding of a new WBUR poll (topline, crosstabs) on the four statewide questions on the ballot this November. The survey, conducted Sept. 7-10 by The MassINC Polling Group, finds opponents of the measure to expand charter schools outnumber supporters of the measure, 48 percent to 41 percent. Eleven percent of respondents said they don't know, or are undecided. Paula Bock Tranter, a florist in East Freetown, is one of the poll respondents who opposes expanding charter schools. "Not everybody can go to the charter schools, and the charter schools aren't regulated like the public schools are, so, you're lucky if you hit a good charter school, but if you don't, it's ... not good, and I feel like everybody should have the same education," she said. Question 2 proposes to allow up to 12 new charter schools a year statewide. It has the support of Gov. Charlie Baker. His chairman of the Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, Paul Sagan, has donated $100,000 to one of the four political action committees supporting the measure. They have already raised more than $12 million, almost double what opponents have raised. Nearly $6 million in support of expanding charter schools has come from a New York group called Families for Excellent Schools Advocacy, a so-called "dark money" group that does not have to disclose its donors. Among the other large contributors is Walmart heiress Alice Walton, who made a $710,000 donation this summer. Stephen Wade, a grandfather in Webster, is among the likely voters who would like to see more charter schools. "They don't want to put their kids into public school systems because of all the political correctness," Wade said. "You look at this transgender bathroom issue. A lot of parents are going nuts over that. It's almost like there's a liberal progressive movement to rewrite history." But despite all the political and financial support for expanding charter schools, 46 percent of likely voters polled say charter schools would drain money from other public schools, while 38 percent say they would not. The live telephone poll surveyed 506 likely voters. It has a margin of error of 4.4 percent. Steve Koczela, the president of The MassINC Polling Group, has worked for supporters of expanding charter schools, so WBUR has chosen not to interview him on this question. (David Zalubowski/AP) Support For Marijuana Legalization The poll also finds supporters of a ballot question legalizing marijuana slightly outnumbering opponents. Fifty percent of respondents say they would vote to legalize marijuana, while 45 percent oppose legalization. Five percent are undecided or said they don't know. "There's some big demographic splits, particularly along age lines," Koczela said. "Younger people are very much in favor of legalization, and it declines steadily as you move up the age brackets to where you get to voters who are 60-plus, and they're opposed to it by a 17-point margin." Among voters 60 and older, 56 percent oppose legalizing marijuana, while 39 percent support it. But among voters under 30, 65 percent support legalization. "It's not something I do personally, but I think it's something adults should have the right to do," said 33-year-old Shawn Staines, a high school teacher who lives in Sterling. On the opposing side is 53-year-old Jonathan Cooper, of Framingham. "Basically, I believe marijuana is just a gateway to other drugs, and I don't think it's a good situation to have complete total access to the drug," Cooper said. "Don't like it." Cooper is in the minority in our poll, both in his opposition to legalizing marijuana, and on the question of whether it's a gateway drug. Fifty percent of poll respondents say people using marijuana are not more likely to try other drugs, versus 43 percent who say they are. The Other 2 Questions  There are four initiatives on the November ballot. Of the other two, one appears headed to easy passage. Sixty-six percent of likely voters say they support an initiative that would prohibit the sale in Massachusetts of meat or eggs from hens, calves and pigs that are confined in a way that prevents them from moving around. Twenty-five percent of poll respondents say they oppose the initiative. The other initiative appears headed for defeat. Fifty-two percent of voters say they oppose allowing a slot parlor near Suffolk Downs. Related: Should Mass. Expand Charter Schools?

NEW YORK — U.S. stocks surged Monday after a Federal Reserve official said the central bank should not raise interest rates too soon, which came as a big relief to investors. After a market nosedive Friday, investors bought safe investments like household goods makers and phone companies. Technology companies also jumped. Stocks started the day lower after Friday's drop, but they soon rallied. Investors were pleased when Lael Brainard, a member of the Federal Reserve board, said the Fed should not raise interest rates quickly because that could hurt the economy. The biggest gains went to safe investments that pay big dividends, as they are more enticing to investors when interest rates and bond yields are low. Stocks plunged Friday after remarks from another Fed official that suggested interest rates could go up next week. David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds, said he thinks Federal Reserve policymakers seem “noncommittal” and are not sure if they should raise interest rates now or not. In his opinion, the Fed's cautious attitude toward raising interest rates even a little is causing strong market reactions. “The more cautious they are, the more sensitive the market becomes,” he said. “What's one quarter of one percent? It's nothing.” The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 239.62 points, or 1.3 percent, to 18,325.07. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 31.23 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,159.04. The Nasdaq composite surged 85.98 points, or 1.7 percent, to 5,211.89. The gains in the main three U.S. indexes made up for more than half of Friday's losses. As investors sought safe-play picks, retail giant Wal-Mart rose $1.64, or 2.3 percent, to $71.94 and Procter & Gamble gained $2.01, or 2.3 percent, to $88.25. Phone companies also rose and AT&T gained $1, or 2.5 percent, to $40.71. Those stocks took some of the biggest losses Friday. HP agreed to buy Samsung's printer business for $1.05 billion, and HP stock climbed 54 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $14.49. That helped take technology stocks higher. Elsewhere, Apple was up $2.31, or 2.2 percent, to $105.44, and communications chip maker Broadcom picked up $3.70, or 2.3 percent, to $164.48. Canadian companies Agrium and Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan agreed to combine into the world's largest crop nutrient company. The companies value their combined business at $36 billion, and Potash shareholders will own a majority of stock in the new company. Potash stock lost 21 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $16.76 and Agrium dipped $2.57, or 2.7 percent, to $92.64. Markets overseas took sharp losses following the rout in the U.S. Friday. Germany's DAX fell 1.3 percent, and the CAC-40 in France lost 1.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares gave up 1.1 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index dropped 1.7 percent, and South Korea's Kospi slid 2.3 percent. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng shed 3.4 percent. U.S. stocks had plunged late last week after Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said there's a case to be made the U.S. central bank should raise rates sooner rather than later. Rosengren and Brainard have both been reluctant to raise rates too quickly. Investors are not sure if the central bank will raise interest rates, and they're not sure the economy is healthy enough to handle that. Higher rates threaten stocks by making interest-paying savings accounts and bonds more attractive to investors. They could also ding corporate earnings by raising companies' borrowing costs. Irish drugmaker Perrigo added $6.52, or 7.3 percent, to $95.23 after activist investment firm Starboard Value bought a 4.6 percent stake in the company. Starboard Value said Perrigo needs to boost profit margins for some of divisions, and notes that the company's stock hasn't done well since Perrigo rejected an offer from competitor Mylan NV. Perrigo said it will review Starboard's comments. U.S. crude rose 41 cents to $46.29 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil trading, climbed 31 cents to $48.32 a barrel in London. Energy Transfer Pipeline fell $1.19, or 3 percent, to $37.95. On Friday a federal judge ruled that the company can build a $3.8 billion pipeline intended to carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois. That sent the company's stock higher. But the federal government stepped in to temporarily stop part of the project, and several agencies said they will reconsider their decisions supporting it. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe wants to stop construction of part of the pipeline because it crosses sacred sites and approaches a lake that provides drinking water for a reservation in southern North Dakota. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 3 cents to $1.39 a gallon. Heating oil added 1 cent to $1.44 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 12 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $2.92 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $8.90 to $1,325.60 an ounce. Silver lost 37 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $19 an ounce. Copper gained 1 cent to $2.10 a pound. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.67 percent from 1.68 percent. The dollar dropped to 101.84 yen from 102.69 yen late Friday. The euro climbed to $1.1241 from $1.1228.

China's largest firms need to build competitiveness and profitability By Wang Jun | NO. 37 SEPTEMBER 15, 2016 State Grid Corp. of China ranks second on the Fortune Global 500 list in 2016, with business revenue of $329.6 billion (CFP) The Fortune Global 500, an annual list of the globe's top 500 companies by revenue, now includes 110 Chinese firms, an increase for the 10th consecutive year, according to the Fortune Global 500's 2016 edition released late July. However, the Top 500 Enterprises of China 2016 list, unveiled by the China Enterprise Confederation (CEC) on August 27, shows that the combined revenue of China's top 500 companies fell for the first time in 15 years. "Among the world's top 500, companies from China and the United States account for nearly half, reflecting the change in the world economic structure," said Miao Rong, chief researcher of the CEC's research department. "But for Chinese enterprises, most of which are in construction, iron, coal and non-ferrous metals industries, there is still much to be done in reducing 'puffiness' and becoming both bigger and stronger." Bigger presence, heavier loss Since 2011, the global business expansion of multinational companies has slowed. Business revenue growth has dropped off in lists of the world's top 500, the U.S. top 500, and China's top 500, though growth in China's top 500 remains higher than that in the other lists. Business revenues and assets of Chinese top 500 companies have grown 1.7 and 2.7 times respectively compared to 2008, while those of the global 500 grew by only 17 and 12.9 percent, respectively. China's highest entry on the Fortune Global 500, State Grid Corp. of China, with business revenue of $329.6 billion, ranks second only behind Wal-Mart. Just behind, in third and fourth place respectively, are China National Petroleum Corp. and China Petrochemical Corp. Among the 110 Chinese firms on the global list, 13 are debutants, and 73 have seen their rankings move ahead by 43.1 places on average. However, debutant JD.com, the e-commerce giant, has also suffered the second largest loss among the Chinese companies on the global list, losing $1.49 billion in 2015. This reflects the Achilles heel of the Top 500 Enterprises of China: They are greater in size, but their losses are also mounting. In the 2016 edition, 72 firms (14.4 percent) reported losses, compared to 57 last year, with companies in iron, non-ferrous metals and coal accounting for much of the losses. In comparison, seven fewer firms in the Fortune Global 500 and 17 fewer firms in the U.S. top 500 reported losses. The average profit of firms in the Top 500 Enterprises of China is also lower than that in the U.S. equivalent. "Revenues generated by China's top 500 are 78.9 percent of those in the U.S. top 500, while net profit gained is a mere 52.63 percent of the U.S. figure," said Miao. "This indicates that Chinese firms are big, but not strong enough. Without a strong competitive core, Chinese companies will find their profitability limited. Causes and prescription What has curbed the profitability of the Top 500 Enterprises of China? Structural problems are still outstanding. On the Fortune Global 500, the 134 U.S. firms come from 46 industries, most of which are high value-added, such as finance, insurance, healthcare, pharmacy, food production and sales and high-end manufacturing. The 99 Chinese mainland firms hail from 30 industries, however most of these are traditional, such as banking, mining, crude oil, engineering, car components, and metals. Of the top Chinese 500, almost one third (154) are from the real estate, construction, iron and steel, coal and non-ferrous metals industries, which are suffering severe overcapacity and price declines. "Most big Chinese firms are in traditional industries that face heavy pressure to reduce overcapacity, and these industries are a major target of the supply-side reform," said Wang Zhongyu, Chairman of the CEC. Per-capita revenue from Chinese mainland firms in the Fortune Global 500 is only 76 percent of the average. Likewise, per-capita profits lag, with the average of $17,300 for Chinese firms trailing the overall average of $22,400. "To improve the profitability of Chinese firms, the country must accelerate supply-side reform. Chinese companies, especially state-owned enterprises, are facing the outstanding challenge of reducing staff to increase productivity," said Miao. He also explained the monopoly factor in Chinese firms: "Compared with the Fortune Global 500, profits gained in the China top 500 mainly come from industries of monopoly with low business costs, however they lack core competitiveness in competitive sectors." He added, "This indicates that China's top 500 firms still have to improve innovation to drive their growth." Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., the world leader in patent applications in 2014, was ranked 27th in the latest Top 500 Enterprises of China list. The company invested 59.6 billion yuan ($8.91 billion) in research and development, accounting for 15.1 percent of its total revenue and putting Huawei 15th among all companies of the world in this regard. Benefiting from such high input in research and development, Huawei has jumped 268 places to number 129 in this year's rankings of the Fortune Global 500 since it first made the cut in 2010. "Innovation is the life of a company. In an era when intelligent technology develops rapidly, every entrepreneur must have crisis awareness and bear in mind that not to advance is to retreat and to advance slowly is also to retreat, in order to gain the initiative through innovation. Otherwise we might lose a golden opportunity for development," said Cui Genliang, President of Hengtong Group Co. Ltd., a China top 500 company. For further growth, Chinese firms also need the government to create a better business environment. Miao said about 40 percent of Chinese top 500 are private companies, who have benefited a lot from reform and opening-up policies, yet they are now facing great uncertainties. "Establishing proper relations between the government and businesses, and ensuring their performance under a legal framework will be sure to profoundly shape the growth of big private companies," Miao said.

Daniel B. Kline (TMFDankline) Sep 12, 2016 at 4:45PM Costco (NASDAQ:COST) sales have been essentially flat year to date. For the 52-week fiscal year which closed Aug. 28, the warehouse club reported net sales of $116.1 billion, a 2% increase from the $113.7 billion reported last year. Those numbers aren't awful, but they hint at weakness. When it comes to comparable sales, the numbers weren't great either, though they look better after adjusting for falling gas prices and foreign currency exchange. After the adjustment, the increase in the United States jumps from 2% to 3% and the Canada numbers go from a 3% decline to an 8% gain. International numbers were similar, moving from a 3% dip before adjustment to a 4% positive move after. Still, overall, before the adjustment, 52-week growth was 0%, and after it was only a 4% gain. Those are mediocre results, which point to three things that could hurt Costco's stock price going forward. Costco's business model has been to drive people to its stores. Image source: author. Competitors are getting better As a warehouse club, the Costco model is built on offering great prices but limited selection. In the past, that made other warehouse clubs such as Wal-Mart's (NYSE:WMT) Sam's Club its only real competition. Now, however, the chain increasingly has to deal with traditional stores offering aggressive pricing. Wal-Mart specifically has committed to spending billions to lower prices. That's a big problem for Costco, because the traditional retailer's deals don't require buying food in specific large quantities. If a regular grocery store will sell a box of cereal at a price close to what Costco charges, but the warehouse club requires buying two extra-large boxes, it's easy to see why consumers may shy away from bulk purchases. That's not a big problem if it simply costs Costco some sales, but it becomes a much bigger issue if consumers stop believing Costco consistently has the best deal. If that happens, people will drop their memberships -- and fees from people paying their annual dues accounts for 75% of the chain's profits. Essentially it's OK if consumers go to the warehouse club less, as long as they still see the value of remaining members. It's possible that more aggressive traditional stores will tip the balance in favor of people who drop their membership. Amazon makes everything easy Costco has mostly ignored the Internet because it's built its business around driving people to its stores. That makes sense because once people hit a warehouse, they can be enticed into buying things they'd not planned on. In addition, part of the Costco mystique revolves around bargain hunting in its stores. That's generally been a strong formula. People join Costco partly because it's fun to shop in the stores even when you don't buy anything. Add that to the fact that prices are generally below other options (albeit with the hassle of having to buy in bulk), and you can see why the chain has thrived. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) has already taken away one of those advantages. It has comparable, and in some cases lower, prices than the warehouse club chain. It also has improved delivery to the point that it can get pretty much anything to consumers in two days or less. What Amazon hasn't equaled is the experience of exploring a Costco store. It's still fun to walk into one of the chain's locations and discover that you really need a kayak or a palette of K-Cups. Online retail has struggled to equal that experience, but Amazon has gotten better at it with its flash sales and Prime Day, which had a bit of the unknown that Costco does so well turning into sales. Should Costco shareholders worry? The big concern is that these two problems have been evident for a long time and management hasn't done much to address them. Price competition has been a reality since Amazon became a major player, and it's doing a better job getting consumers to buy more than they intended to or purchase items just because the price is right. Costco has a long runway. It's not a retailer being obliterated by discounters or the internet, but there are signs of weakness. These are two areas to watch -- and concerns management needs to do more to address. Neither presents a reason to panic, but growth has slowed, and this might explain why.

Technology companies also jumped. Stocks started the day lower following Friday's drop, but they soon rallied. Investors were pleased when Lael Brainard, a member of the Federal Reserve board, said the Fed should not raise interest rates quickly because that could hurt the economy. The biggest gains went to safe investments that pay big dividends, as they are more enticing to investors when interest rates and bond yields are low. Stocks had plunged on Friday following remarks from another Fed official that suggested interest rates could go up next week. David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds, said he thinks Federal Reserve policymakers seem "noncommittal" and aren't sure if they should raise interest rates now or not. In his opinion, the Fed's cautious attitude toward raising interest rates even a little is causing strong market reactions. "The more cautious they are, the more sensitive the market becomes," he said. "What's one quarter of 1%? It's nothing." The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 239.62 points, or 1.3%, to 18,325.07. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 31.23 points, or 1.5%, to 2,159.04. The Nasdaq composite surged 85.98 points, or 1.7%, to 5,211.89. The gains in the main three U.S. indexes made up for more than half of Friday's losses. As investors sought safe-play picks, retail giant Wal-Mart rose 1.64 dollars, or 2.3%, to 71.94 dollars and Procter & Gamble gained 2.01 dollars, or 2.3%, to 88.25 dollars. Phone companies also rose and AT&T gained one dollar, or 2.5%, to 40.71 dollars. Those stocks took some of the biggest losses on Friday. HP agreed to buy Samsung's printer business for 1.05 billion dollars, and HP stock rose 54 cents, or 3.9%, to 14.49 dollars. That helped take technology stocks higher. Elsewhere, Apple rose 2.31 dollars, or 2.2%, to 105.44 dollars and communications chip maker Broadcom picked up 3.70 dollars, or 2.3%, to 164.48 dollars. Canadian companies Agrium and Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan agreed to combine into the world's largest crop nutrient company. The companies value their combined business at 36 billion dollars, and Potash shareholders will own a majority of stock in the new company. Potash stock lost 21 cents, or 1.2%, to 16.76 dollars and Agrium dipped 2.57 dollars, or 2.7%, to 92.64 dollars. Markets overseas took sharp losses following the rout in the U.S. Friday. Germany's Dax fell 1.3% while the CAC-40 in France also lost 1.2%. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares gave up 1.1%. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 1.7% and South Korea's Kospi slid 2.3%. In Hong Kong the Hang Seng shed 3.4%. US stocks had plunged late last week after Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said there was a case to be made the US central bank should raise rates sooner rather than later. Mr Rosengren and Mr Brainard have both been reluctant to raise rates too quickly. Investors are not sure if the central bank will raise interest rates, and they're not sure the economy is healthy enough to handle that. Higher rates threaten stocks by making interest-paying savings accounts and bonds more attractive to investors. They could also ding corporate earnings by raising companies' borrowing costs. Irish drugmaker Perrigo added 6.52 dollars, or 7.3%, to 95.23 dollars after activist investment firm Starboard Value bought a 4.6% stake in the company. Starboard Value said Perrigo needs to boost profit margins for some of divisions, and notes that the company's stock has not done well since Perrigo rejected an offer from competitor Mylan NV. Perrigo said it will review Starboard's comments. US crude rose 41 cents to 46.29 dollars a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil trading, climbed 31 cents to 48.32 dollars a barrel in London. Energy Transfer Pipeline fell 1.19 dollars, or 3%, to 37.95 dollars. On Friday a federal judge ruled that the company can build a 3.8 billion dollar pipeline intended to carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois. That sent the company's stock higher. But the federal government stepped in to temporarily stop part of the project, and several agencies said they will reconsider their decisions supporting it. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe wants to stop construction of part of the pipeline because it crosses sacred sites and approaches a lake that provides drinking water for a reservation in southern North Dakota. In other energy trading, wholesale petrol gained three cents to 1.39 dollars a gallon. Heating oil added one cent to 1.44 dollars a gallon. Natural gas jumped 12 cents, or 4.2%, to 2.92 dollars per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell 8.90 dollars to 1,325.60 dollars an ounce. Silver lost 37 cents, or 1.9%, to 19 dollars an ounce. Copper gained one cent to 2.10 dollars a pound. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.67% from 1.68%. The dollar fell to 101.84 yen from 102.69 yen late Friday. The euro rose to 1.1241 from 1.1228 dollars. KEYWORDS: stocks, federal reserve, interest rates, ftse   send us stuff PreviousNext Want us to email you the top news stories each lunchtime?

NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks surged Monday after a Federal Reserve official said the central bank shouldn't raise interest rates too soon, which came as a big relief to investors. After a market nosedive on Friday, investors bought safe investments like household goods makers and phone companies. Technology companies also jumped. Stocks started the day lower following Friday's drop, but they soon rallied. Investors were pleased when Lael Brainard, a member of the Federal Reserve board, said the Fed shouldn't raise interest rates quickly because that could hurt the economy. The biggest gains went to safe investments that pay big dividends, as they are more enticing to investors when interest rates and bond yields are low. Stocks had plunged Friday following remarks from another Fed official that suggested interest rates could go up next week. David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds, said he thinks Federal Reserve policymakers seem "noncommittal" and aren't sure if they should raise interest rates now or not. In his opinion, the Fed's cautious attitude toward raising interest rates even a little is causing strong market reactions. "The more cautious they are, the more sensitive the market becomes," he said. "What's one quarter of one percent? It's nothing." The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 239.62 points, or 1.3 percent, to 18,325.07. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 31.23 points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,159.04. The Nasdaq composite surged 85.98 points, or 1.7 percent, to 5,211.89. The gains in the main three U.S. indexes made up for more than half of Friday's losses. As investors sought safe-play picks, retail giant Wal-Mart rose $1.64, or 2.3 percent, to $71.94 and Procter & Gamble gained $2.01, or 2.3 percent, to $88.25. Phone companies also rose and AT&T gained $1, or 2.5 percent, to $40.71. Those stocks took some of the biggest losses Friday. HP agreed to buy Samsung's printer business for $1.05 billion, and HP stock rose 54 cents, or 3.9 percent, to $14.49. That helped take technology stocks higher. Elsewhere, Apple rose $2.31, or 2.2 percent, to $105.44 and communications chip maker Broadcom picked up $3.70, or 2.3 percent, to $164.48. Canadian companies Agrium and Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan agreed to combine into the world's largest crop nutrient company. The companies value their combined business at $36 billion, and Potash shareholders will own a majority of stock in the new company. Potash stock lost 21 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $16.76 and Agrium dipped $2.57, or 2.7 percent, to $92.64. Markets overseas took sharp losses following the rout in the U.S. Friday. Germany's DAX fell 1.3 percent while the CAC-40 in France also lost 1.2 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares gave up 1.1 percent. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index lost 1.7 percent and South Korea's Kospi slid 2.3 percent. In Hong Kong the Hang Seng shed 3.4 percent. U.S. stocks had plunged late last week after Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said there's a case to be made the U.S. central bank should raise rates sooner rather than later. Rosengren and Brainard have both been reluctant to raise rates too quickly. Investors are not sure if the central bank will raise interest rates, and they're not sure the economy is healthy enough to handle that. Higher rates threaten stocks by making interest-paying savings accounts and bonds more attractive to investors. They could also ding corporate earnings by raising companies' borrowing costs. Irish drugmaker Perrigo added $6.52, or 7.3 percent, to $95.23 after activist investment firm Starboard Value bought a 4.6 percent stake in the company. Starboard Value said Perrigo needs to boost profit margins for some of divisions, and notes that the company's stock hasn't done well since Perrigo rejected an offer from competitor Mylan NV. Perrigo said it will review Starboard's comments. U.S. crude rose 41 cents to $46.29 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, the benchmark for international oil trading, climbed 31 cents to $48.32 a barrel in London. Energy Transfer Pipeline fell $1.19, or 3 percent, to $37.95. On Friday a federal judge ruled that the company can build a $3.8 billion pipeline intended to carry oil from North Dakota to Illinois. That sent the company's stock higher. But the federal government stepped in to temporarily stop part of the project, and several agencies said they will reconsider their decisions supporting it. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe wants to stop construction of part of the pipeline because it crosses sacred sites and approaches a lake that provides drinking water for a reservation in southern North Dakota. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline gained 3 cents to $1.39 a gallon. Heating oil added 1 cent to $1.44 a gallon. Natural gas jumped 12 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $2.92 per 1,000 cubic feet. Gold fell $8.90 to $1,325.60 an ounce. Silver lost 37 cents, or 1.9 percent, to $19 an ounce. Copper gained 1 cent to $2.10 a pound. Bond prices rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 1.67 percent from 1.68 percent. The dollar fell to 101.84 yen from 102.69 yen late Friday. The euro rose to $1.1241 from $1.1228. ___ AP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay We have recently upgraded our commenting system.
