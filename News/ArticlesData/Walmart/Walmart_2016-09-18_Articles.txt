The hefty price tag shows how heavily Walmart is willing to invest as it tries to boost online sales that totaled $13.7 billion last year — still just a fraction of the company’s annual revenue. While Walmart and Jet.com will operate as separate brands, Walmart has said it will incorporate some of Jet.com’s “smart technology” that lowers prices in real times by looking for ways to cut costs. As part of the deal, which was announced in early August, Jet.com co-founder and CEO Marc Lore will oversee both that site and Walmart.com, and will report to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon. Lore will serve as executive vice president at Walmart and president and CEO of Walmart’s e-commerce business in the U.S. Lore brings to the role a rich e-commerce resume as founder of Quidsi, the parent Diapers.com, which was bought by Amazon for $500 million in 2010. As part of the stock portion of the deal, Lore received 3.55 million shares of restricted Walmart common stock to be paid over five years. The exact value depends on Walmart’s share price. But based on Monday’s closing price of $72.09, the shares would have a current worth of nearly $256 million. Jet’s pricing technology is built on an algorithm that determines which sellers are the most efficient in value and shipping and adjusts prices based on what items are in the checkout cart as well as how far the desired products are from the shoppers’ home. So shoppers are encouraged to add more to build a more efficient cart and buy items labeled “smart cart” for more savings. Analysts say that the deal still won’t enable Walmart to catch up to online leader Amazon.com in sales, but will help narrow the gap and should widen the distance between Walmart and other online rivals. For Jet.com, which had been pouring money into splashy TV ads and other marketing, being owned by Walmart should accelerate its path to profitability. In a Wal-Mart blog post on Monday, McMillon wrote, “Wal-Mart and Jet.com obsess about saving customers time and money. By joining forces, we’ll be better at doing both, creating seamless shopping from app to site to store.” On McMillon’s Instagram account was an image of Jet’s purple T-shirt with a note saying, “I’ve been waiting a month to put on this shirt.” Tags:  Walmart Digital & Driveway Delivery - 50% Off blog comments powered by Disqus More in Business Volkswagen to shed 30,000 jobs, cutting costs after scandal November 18, 2016, 6:53 am Volkswagen announced plans Friday to cut 30,000 jobs in a wide-ranging restructuring of its namesake brand as it tries to recover from a scandal over cars rigged to cheat on diesel emissions tests.

So far, they seem to be paying off. Jeremy Bowman (TMFHobo) Sep 19, 2016 at 6:06PM Image Source: Wal-Mart.   What happened Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) took its latest step to reinvent itself by filing a patent for a self-driving shopping cart last week. The world's largest retailer has patented a technology that will allow customers to summon shopping carts with their phones and use them hands-free. The carts will also guide customers through the store to the items on their shopping list, and return themselves to a station in the parking lot, saving on customer and employee labor. The company also hopes the carts can help save further on labor by assisting with moving and checking inventory and retrieving other merchandise. The robotic shopping cart is just the company's latest innovation -- it's also made steps to get drones approved for delivery and merchandise checking in the warehouse, and rolled out hundreds of kiosks in store parking lots where customers can pick up groceries they've ordered online. Does it matter? Wal-Mart needs to stay at the forefront of technology as it competes with Amazon.com and the rest of retail. While a self-driving shopping cart may not match the convenience of e-commerce, the vast majority of Wal-Mart's sales are going to come from its stores for probably decades no matter how much it invests in e-commerce. That's why it spent billions on higher wages, training, and improving store appearance. It also explains the online grocery pickup program. Its stores are its biggest differentiator over a company like Amazon, so it's crucial that the company make the shopping experience as pleasant as possible. Wal-Mart's recent efforts seem to be paying off. Same-store sales reached their fastest clip in several years in its most recent quarter at 1.6%, and the company also reversed a 2-year slide in e-commerce sales growth thanks in part to the grocery pick-up program.  There's no word yet on when the self-driving cart will come to fruition, but look for similar innovations to come out of the retail giant in the near future.  Jeremy Bowman has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Walmart closes $3.3 billion deal for Jet.com 0 Share: Internet by Ben Fox Rubin September 19, 2016 1:39 PM PDT @benfoxrubin Up Next President Obama slams fake news for eroding democracy A employee builds dozens of purple Jet boxes for upcoming orders.Photo by Ben Fox Rubin/CNET Walmart's push to take on Amazon took a big step forward Monday. The big-box retailer closed its $3.3 billion acquisition of e-commerce retailer Jet.com, pulling off one of the biggest e-commerce deals ever and giving Walmart a new set of tools and talent to bulk up online. Still, Walmart now faces the difficult job of making this tie-up pay off by bringing together all its resources to create an Amazon alternative people will want to use. Jet, led by e-commerce veteran Marc Lore and backed by hundreds of millions of dollars in funding, launched its site a little more than a year ago, offering consumer products ranging from laptops to shampoo to furniture. The size of the Jet deal, which was first announced last month, shows how serious Walmart has become in wanting to be a bigger force online, in hopes of goosing its lagging sales growth and stopping Amazon from stealing its customers. (In a nod to Walmart's effort to become more tech-focused, CEO Doug McMillon broke the news of the Jet deal closing on Instagram.) Walmart has been trying for years to become a more significant player in e-commerce, pouring billions of dollars into its warehouse infrastructure and website. But, so far, it's had little to show for it, with its e-commerce sales growth slowing in most recent quarters. Walmart is paying a king's ransom to bring on Lore, the new CEO of Walmart's e-commerce arm in the US. Lore, who led the parent company of Diapers.com before selling it to Amazon for $545 million five years ago, will receive more than 3.5 million Walmart shares in the deal -- worth roughly $250 million as of Monday -- which will vest over five years. MORE ON WALMART AND JET Congrats, Walmart! You just realized e-commerce is a thing Walmart to scoop up Jet.com for $3.3B to better battle Amazon Why Jet.com says it's got a 'smarter way' for you to shop online The deal should help Walmart reach more users online, helping the company access Jet's wealthier customers who may not typically buy on Walmart.com. Jet customers tend to spend more than Walmart and Amazon customers on high-end products, such as athletic shoes and fragrances, according to a study from researcher 1010data. For example, the average Jet customer spends $55.85 on athletic shoes, while the Walmart.com customer spends just $16.42. Also, both Jet and Walmart like to encourage their customers to bulk up their orders, so the two sites will benefit from that common strategy. On the negative side, even together Jet and Walmart make up just a sliver of the US e-commerce market, while Amazon is by far the largest online seller. Additionally, Walmart and Jet now have to figure out how to integrate their teams and technologies, while operating two separate websites: Walmart.com and Jet.com. That means that if Walmart does plan to catch up to Amazon, Jet won't rocket the company there soon.

Martinez, 43, of Lexington Avenue made his first court appearance on the charges today in Central Judicial Processing from Hudson County jail in Kearny. He is charged with eluding police by failing to stop his vehicle after receiving a signal from the officer to stop, and placing the officer at risk of death or serious injury, the criminal complaint states. Martinez, who court officials said has 28 prior arrests, is also charged with receiving stolen property – the 2012 Honda he was driving at the time of the incident. The officer fired multiple shots at him in the Walmart parking lot, striking him in the arm through the windshield. Finally, he is charged with shoplifting, the complaint says. Authorities say Martinez had shoplifted at the Walmart and was fleeing the scene when the officer arrived and commanded him to stop.  Probable cause for the charges is listed as the statements of witnesses and video surveillance footage that shows he "eluded a uniformed Kearny police officer after receiving multiple commands to stop his vehicle while creating a risk of injury to the officer," the complaint says. Martinez, who had a passenger in the vehicle, fled the parking lot but was arrested hours later in Newark by Kearny police. The passenger, Diego C. Dosreis, 28, also of Newark, was charged with receiving stolen property, officials said. The officer was not injured but he was evaluated at a local hospital, which is standard procedure when an officer fires his weapon, Kearny Mayor Al Santos said. He was later released. The mayor added that the officer had been nearby at the time of the incident and responded immediately. "The suspect is believed to have been a fleeing shoplifter and he threatened the officer with his vehicle," Santos said Friday. "The officer had to respond. He shot at the suspect because he was threatened by the suspect's vehicle as he tried to get away from the police officer trying to apprehend him." The shooting is being reviewed by the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office, as is the case in all instances when a law enforcement officer discharges his weapon in Hudson County. Martinez was informed that his bail has been set at $40,000 cash only when he appeared in Central Judicial Processing court in Jersey City this afternoon via video link from Hudson County jail in Kearny. Martinez said little at the hearing but did mention that his arm hurt. Dosreis did no appear in CJP today.  Most Read Active Discussions nj.com About Us About NJ.com Advertise with us Contact Us Visit OMJ.com Frequently Asked Questions Jobs at NJ Advance Media Newsletters RSS feeds More on NJ.com Interact Weather Site map Claim your free business listing Sponsor Content Search Place an ad Sell your car Sell/rent your home Post a job Post a free classified ad Apartments & rentals NJ.com Sections N.J.

(Photo: SAUL LOEB, AFP/Getty Images) Walmart’s decision to hone in on its online business crossed a critical threshold Monday when it finalized its $3 billion purchase of e-commerce site Jet.com. Walmart’s president and CEO, Doug McMillon, took to Instagram to announce  the closure of a deal that the retailer hopes will enable it to cultivate and cater to more consumers online. “Together, both Jet.com and Walmart.com will be able to leverage each other’s assets to grow the ways we serve customers,’’ McMillon said in a post on Walmart’s blog Monday. Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, has been making bold moves to bolster both its online business and super centers, as it fights  to remain dominant amid a rapidly changing retail landscape. It’s filling store aisles with attractive displays of organic and gourmet items to attract shoppers seeking fresh food options.  And with Walmart.com, an online grocery offering, and now Jet.com, which caters to a more affluent shopper, the retailer is widening its e-commerce footprint. Walmart.com and Jet.com will continue to be separate brands, the retailers says. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2deN08T

Deal. Walmart announced on Monday that its monster $3.3 billion acquisition of e-commerce startup Jet.com is official. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon broke the news with a photo posted to Instagram on Monday. Startup-y! I've been waiting a month to put on this shirt. Today is the day. Happy to officially welcome Jet.com to the Walmart family! A photo posted by Doug McMillon (@dougmcmillon) on Sep 19, 2016 at 1:01pm PDT In a blog post, McMillon explained the deal by saying, “Walmart and Jet.com obsess about saving customers time and money. By joining forces, we’ll be better at doing both, creating seamless shopping from app to site to store.” After the honeymoon ends, the challenges for both sides will be many. For one, Amazon continues to gain market share in the U.S. and doesn’t appear to be losing any steam, while Walmart’s e-commerce growth has decelerated for most of the past year and a half. Jet.com also has to prove that it can develop a loyal customer base over many years, not just one powered by heavy advertising spending. And for Jet CEO Marc Lore, who will also run Walmart.com, there’s the tough task of bridging the gap between the company’s e-commerce efforts based in Silicon Valley and the core brick-and-mortar operation, which still accounts for the vast majority of revenue, in Arkansas. There’s a lot of money riding on both sides overcoming these challenges. recode_divider More From Recode DraftKings and FanDuel are (officially) merging Here’s the secret to Starry Internet’s plan to beam the internet to your house and break up the broadband monopoly Full transcript: Recode’s April Glaser talks drones on Too Embarrassed to Ask Recode Daily: Fake Facebook news is a danger to democracy, says Obama Do 'productivity hacks' really help you get stuff done?

ASI features Wal-Mart CFO Fri, 09/16/2016 - 12:00am -- Garrett Howard Wal-Mart’s executive vice president and chief financial officer (CFO) Brett Biggs kicked off the American Studies Institute’s Distinguished Lecture Series on Thursday, Sept. 8 in the Benson Auditorium. Biggs, a 1990 graduate from Harding’s College of Business, spoke on capitalism and the free market in America and helped inaugurate the Waldron Center for Entrepreneurship and Family Business on Friday, Sept. 9. “I believe the impact the center will have on the student body will be great,” Biggs said in his speech. “This aspect of business can be an essential part of life for not just business majors, but everyone in all fields.” Biggs’ thoughts on the Mabee building’s new addition tied into the theme of his lecture for the night, which focused on the importance of business and the impact Harding had on his success. Over the past eight years, Wal-Mart has hired 29 Harding students through the company’s accounting and finance development program. “(Harding Students) do amazingly well with our company,” Biggs said. Biggs also stressed the importance of developing relationships both at school and in the work force. “You will advance in your field based on how good you are, but there will be a part of your growth that won’t go any further unless you learn to work well with people,” Biggs said. “You have to learn to be adaptable with people … the world changes so quickly.” Biggs even reflected on his own adaptability while a student at Harding. According to Biggs, during his senior year, he was persuaded to go on a field trip to Wal-Mart for business majors. Although reluctant to go, he went on the trip and met Sam Walton, who offered these words of wisdom: “You keep studying, you keep working hard, and you never know what you’ll end up doing.” Twenty-six years later, Biggs helps lead the company founded by, what he considers, the greatest entrepreneur of our lifetime. “We are the product of a great entrepreneur,” Biggs said. Biggs said he believes the newly opened Waldron center will provide opportunities for the future, where business can grow and evolve on its own. The center’s location at Harding will exponentially help in the growth of business, according to Biggs. “The intersection of faith and business can get challenging, especially in the world we live in today,” Biggs said. “At Wal-Mart, I don’t have to choose between the two; we’re about taking care of people and doing the right thing.” This, according to Biggs, is why Harding and Wal-Mart mesh so well. “These are two great institutions,” Biggs said. “It’s a great set of values that Mr. Sam built this company on, and I think that is a testament to Harding.” 442 reads The Bison Multimedia See interviews, features, and more from the Bison's multimedia team.

Wal-Mart Chief Executive Doug McMillon announced the closing of the deal, which was pending regulatory approval, in a blog post on the retailer's website. The acquisition will impact Wal-Mart's 2017 fiscal year earnings marginally more than the retailer's initial estimate of a 5 cents per share impact as the transaction closed ahead of time, Wal-Mart said. The deal, which was the largest for an online startup, will give Wal-Mart access to Jet.com's innovative pricing software and will help the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer to better compete with online rival Amazon.com Inc. "A lot of folks ask me 'Why Jet.com?," McMillon said in a blog post. The answer he said was in the savings both Wal-Mart and Jet can together offer shoppers. Jet, with its ability to lower prices as customers add more items to their shopping carts, will help the world's largest retailer reach more customers such as millennial shoppers. The deal would also strengthen Wal-Mart's existing e-commerce infrastructure, McMillon said. Wal-Mart has built its website into the second largest online retailer by traffic in the U.S. in the past six months, the blog post said. It has also expanded the assortment of products on its website from 7 million to 15 million items and is adding a million more each month. Jet's founder Marc Lore will join Wal-Mart as the President and Chief Executive of Wal-Mart's U.S. ecommerce business and will report to McMillon, the company said in a separate statement. "I'll be spending a lot of time with the team in the coming weeks and months focused on scaling Walmart.com and Jet.com," Lore said. Over a five-year period Lore will receive stock units that involve the issuance of 3.55 million shares of Wal-Mart's common stock valued at 10 cents per share, the statement said. This is a part of the $300 million of Wal-Mart shares that would be paid over time as part of the original transaction. The Jet deal follows a five-year e-commerce acquisition spree in which Wal-Mart has bought 15 startups, seeking the talent and technology to make it a dominant player online and narrow the gap with Amazon.

Customers can expect big discounts on groceries, household appliances, clothes, and furniture. Lidl has caused such an impact with its rock bottom prices in the UK that it has forced the country's biggest supermarkets to dramatically slash prices and even lay off workers to stay competitive. The arrival of the chain into the United States could likely force supermarkets here to follow suit. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Kmart is closing 64 stores and firing thousands across 28...

Share this article Share In the UK, Lidl has forced it big competitors such as Tesco, ASDA and Sainsbury's to slash their prices in order to remain competitive  Stores including Food Lion, Bi-Lo, Winn Dixie, and dollar stores such as Dollar General and Family Dollar, could be forced to lower their prices as Lidl expands. Walmart's Neighborhood Market could feel the greatest pressure of all, as Lidl stores will be of similar size, highly price competitive, and highly fine tuned to offer a relevant, convenient store experience.   Lidl has already broken ground on a US distribution facility and headquarters in Virginia, which will cost about $200million, and it has staked out four possible store locations in the Richmond, Virginia, area.  The company has also snatched up leases in dozens of cities, according to local-news reports, and it's seeking store managers in areas including Burlington County, New Jersey; Richmond, Virginia; Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina; Greenville, South Carolina; and Augusta, Georgia.  Walmart's Neighborhood Market and Trader Joes have most to fear with Lidl's arrival Lidl has become a threat to the grocery industry because of its insanely cheap prices and emphasis on fresh food. The stores are small, easy to shop, well located, and emphasize key categories such as fresh produce and prepared foods. The chain manages to keep prices low by limiting inventory to a small selection of private-label items rather than traditional supermarkets which carry several different brands of a single product. There is also much less by way of branding, presentation and customer service with many of the store's products displayed in their shipping cartons to make restocking quick and easy.  Many of Lidl's good are kept in their original packaging which means less workers are needed on the shop floor and allows for quick and easy restocking It means that less workers are needed on the sales floor. Lidl also saves money by requiring customers to bring their own shopping bags and bag their own groceries.  The chain also offers appliances and furniture, and a couple of years ago began to enter the fashion world with a women's clothing collection that saw fuax leather jackets for less than $20.  Since the launch, Lidl has introduced a men's collection, a line of handbags, and a fitness brand. The American stores will offer fresh meat, produce and bakery items, as well as a wide selection of household goods. The company has conducted a good deal of market research in the U.S. and is hiring local talent in the markets it is operating in.  Britain's Tesco pulled out of the United States in 2013 after a costly failure with a new low-price chain called Fresh & Easy.   Share or comment on this article e-mail 4.9k shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

 Walmart's self-driving shopping cart is a new frontier for the Internet of Things BI Intelligence Sep. 19, 2016, 12:13 PM 2,655 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also JD.com is expanding its drone delivery program Alibaba completely smashed its Singles' Day record Omnichannel is pushing Kohl's toward its future This story was delivered to BI Intelligence IoT Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Walmart has secured a patent for self-driving shopping carts, reports Popular Science. The patent, which was filed in March of this year but only published recently, shows a robot positioned under the cart steering it according to the shopper's direction. The carts would be placed within a network of sensors that send data to a central computer so that Walmart can track inventory and match customer needs with available inventory.  This is a different IoT use case for retailers. Beacons have been one of the top IoT devices retailers use to target offers and collect information on consumer spending habits. The same tracking principles and customer-monitoring capabilities will likely be applied to the self-driving shopping carts. The carts may be a good way to keep Walmart’s retail stores technologically advanced and entertaining as their revenue from e-commerce continues to outpace total revenue. Walmart hopes to use the carts to hedge against employee turnover. The shopping carts could potentially do the jobs of many employees, including picking up and delivering packages in the store, returning abandoned items left by customers in carts, and monitoring inventory. Walmart recently announced it was six to nine months away from using drones to track inventories in its warehouses to replace the jobs of quality-assurance employees. The IoT Revolution is picking up speed and when it does, it will change how we live, work, travel, entertain, and more. From connected homes and connected cars to smart buildings and transportation, every aspect of our lives will be affected by the increasing ability of consumers, businesses, and governments to connect to and control everything around them. Imagine “smart mirrors” that allow you to digitally try on clothes. Assembly line sensors that can detect even the smallest decrease in efficiency and determine when crucial equipment needs to be repaired or replaced. GPS-guided agricultural equipment that can plant, fertilize, and harvest crops. Fitness trackers that allow users to transmit data to their doctors. It’s not science fiction. This “next Industrial Revolution” is happening as we speak. It’s so big that it could mean new revenue streams for your company and new opportunities for you. The only question is: Are you fully up to speed on the IoT? After months of researching and reporting this exploding trend, John Greenough and Jonathan Camhi of BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, have put together an essential report on the IoT that explains the exciting present and the fascinating future of the Internet of Things.  It covers how the IoT is being implemented today, where the new sources of opportunity will be tomorrow and how 16 separate sectors of the economy will be transformed over the next 20 years. The report gives a thorough outlook on the future of the Internet of Things, including the following big picture insights: IoT devices connected to the Internet will more than triple by 2020, from 10 billion to 34 billion. IoT devices will account for 24 billion, while traditional computing devices (e.g. smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, etc.) will comprise 10 billion.  Nearly $6 trillion will be spent on IoT solutions over the next five years.  Businesses will be the top adopter of IoT solutions because they will use IoT to 1) lower operating costs; 2) increase productivity; and 3) expand to new markets or develop new product offerings.  Governments will be the second-largest adopters, while consumers will be the group least transformed by the IoT.  And when you dig deep into the report, you’ll get the whole story in a clear, no-nonsense presentation: The complex infrastructure of the Internet of Things distilled into a single ecosystem  The most comprehensive breakdown of the benefits and drawbacks of mesh (e.g. ZigBee, Z-Wave, etc.), cellular (e.g. 3G/4G, Sigfox, etc.), and internet (e.g. Wi-Fi, Ethernet, etc.) networks  The important role analytics systems, including edge analytics, cloud analytics, will play in making the most of IoT investments  The sizable security challenges presented by the IoT and how they can be overcome  The four powerful forces driving IoT innovation, plus the four difficult market barriers to IoT adoption  Complete analysis of the likely future investment in the critical IoT infrastructure:   connectivity, security, data storage, system integration, device hardware, and application development  In-depth analysis of how the IoT ecosystem will change and disrupt 16 different industries  To get your copy of this invaluable guide to the IoT universe, choose one of these options: Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT The choice is yours.

Construction, on the right, will turn the Portage Wal-Mart store into a supercenter.Tom Haroldson/Special to MLive  Portage had approved plans for the expansion that includes a gas station in 2014, but the corporation did not begin construction until this summer. Anne Hatfield, a Wal-Mart spokesperson, said the store will expand from 151,000 square feet to 190,000 and will have additional grocery merchandise, a full-service pharmacy with drive-through, tire and lube express, garden center and an eight-pump gas station next to the south entrance. "We want to make sure our stores meet the needs of our customers today," Hatfield said.  "We want to make sure we are evolving to meet their needs." Construction started on the expansion this summer and is expected to be completed by summer 2017. Wal-Mart has been at the Shaver Road site since January 2005. The city initially approved Wal-Mart for a 218,000 square foot supercenter, 150,000 of that for the store and a future 68,000 square foot addition, along with a gas station, but for various reasons the larger store was not built. The company downsized its plans in 2014 and received city approval, but not before assuring neighbors that stormwater concerns would be addressed. The area residents had said they weren't opposed to the expansion itself, but had issues with its stormwater retention system and whether it was part of some flooding issues because it discharges into Portage Creek behind the store. Vicki Georgeau, director of Portage community development, said her department has been working with Wal-Mart the past two years on the modified supercenter plans. "We think it's good news. We've been anticipating this would be happening since it was built. We're pleased to see after several years of deferred construction that they are building the new expansion." The new supercenter is expected to better compete with the popular Meijer's store down the road. One issue not resolved: Wal-Mart has requested a new sign at the expanded store that is twice the size that city sign codes allow. The issue has been tabled until the Zoning Board of Appeals' Oct. 10 meeting. Tom Haroldson covers Portage, Vicksburg and Schoolcraft for MLive/Kalamazoo Gazette. Contact him at haroldso@charter.net.

Credit: Walmart More like this Walmart's Jet move: Is IT magic enough on its own to take on Amazon? Target kills curbside pilot because it was never a fit Walmart Pay vs. Apple Pay: Hardware age dictates all Video UPS Puts Consumers in Control Despite various short-lived efforts over the years, most retail shopping carts are impressively low-tech. And they almost always have a wheel out of alignment (or are those just the ones I always seem to get?). But a new patent issued to Walmart paints a futuristic vision, with carts driving themselves from the parking lot right to the customer who called for it. Even if Walmart actually chooses to manufacturer and deploy such carts — many patents never get productized — it will be a baby step toward making carts truly useful in retail. Carts could house navigational systems that could literally steer you toward the exact items on your list. For that matter, they could take "accidental" detours by high-margin items and offer you a coupon — as long as you're right there. For the moment, though, let's look at what Walmart's new patent envisions. For starters, it addresses one of the more time-consuming and least profitable — not to mention least popular among employees — tasks at many retailers: Someone has to go fetch the carts and corral the unwieldy units into a cart collection area. And sometimes this happens during rather unpleasant weather. This means that shoppers can leave their carts anywhere they want in the parking lot and the cart will drive itself to a collection area. And when needed, drive itself back into the store and to the specific aisle where it's been summoned. This little change can allow employees to be focused on more profitable customer-service tasks. And it will also neaten up the parking lot. The patent speaks of messy stores and parking lots where "shopping carts are left abandoned, aisles become messy, inventory is not displayed in the proper locations or is not even placed on the sales floor, shelf prices may not be properly set, and theft is hard to discourage." Not quite clear on how an automated shopping cart fixes products being misplaced or improper shelf prices, but such is life. The magic is performed, according to the patent, via "a plurality of sensors, a plurality of motorized transport units, and a control circuit. The control circuit being configured to: receive a shopping container request from a user interface device associated with the customer, determine at least one available shopping container based on data collected by the plurality of sensors, the at least one available shopping container being empty and not used by another customer, select an available shopping container based at least on a location information of the user interface device, select a motorized transport unit to transport the available shopping container, and provide instructions to the motorized transport unit to bring the available shopping container to the customer." How exactly does the cart locate the shopper? The patent offers a few possible avenues including LEDs "that are mounted in the ceiling at known positions throughout the space and that each encode data in the emitted light that identifies the source of the light and thus the location of the light." The patent specifies one company offering such capabilities. "Generally, such lighting systems are known and commercially available, e.g., the ByteLight system from ByteLight of Boston, Mass. In embodiments using a ByteLight system, a typical display screen of the typical smart phone device can be used as a light sensor or light receiver to receive and process data encoded into the light from the ByteLight light sources." The patent also considered low-energy radio beacons, typically using Bluetooth and audio beacons. The idea of intelligent automated shopping carts is hardly new. Four years ago, Microsoft was involved in a trial with Whole Foods about a cart that would also push marketing messages. That trial, however, suffered from some technical issues. Microsoft put out a field of infrared dots with a laser and mapped distortions to navigate the carts. But above a certain light level, the dots got washed out and couldn't be seen. This happened when the carts were near windows or skylights. There are also issues of the cost of keeping the carts powered and connected to the network. Still, Walmart's effort could be the beginning of some intriguing research. Now if it could only fix that bum wheel. This article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network. Want to Join?

But if you use the best savings strategies, you could spend a lot less on Halloween this year — including Halloween parties. Whether you’re hosting a big blowout for Halloween or planning a smaller gathering for friends, there are plenty of ways to avoid a financial scare this season. Here are some ways you can throw a killer Halloween party for under $50. Memory Stockphoto / Shutterstock.com 1. Shop Online for Halloween Decorations Decorations and props are essential for any Halloween celebration, and you’ll find plenty of great deals on Halloween-themed items at stores like Walmart and Target. But when you only have $50 to spend on the entire event, buying a Spooky Living Tree for $15.88 at Walmart or a Halloween Changing Light String for $27 at Target can easily put you over budget. Fortunately, you can still create the right ambiance by flexing your crafting skills and buying wholesale items. Sites like WholesaleHalloweenCostumes.com and Oriental Trading Company sell a variety of party items for a few dollars each. Pick up items like Glow Spray in a Can for just $4.90 to cover dozens of items in the party room or 20 feet of Fright Tape for $3.90 on WholesaleHalloweenCostumes.com. Buy party favors and table decorations in bulk starting at $1.99 per dozen from OrientalTrading.com. These items can help you decorate larger areas, such as doorways, tables and walls with minimal effort — and a minimal dollar investment. GWImages / Shutterstock.com 2. Charge Money Without Charging a Cover You don’t have to charge a door cover to pass some party costs on to your guests. “You could charge a costume entry fee to pool money for the best costume,” said Brent Shelton, online shopping and consumer expert at FatWallet. Charging a $5 fee to enter a costume contest, for example, means you could make $50 when just 20 people enter and split the entry fee 50-50 for the grand prize and to cover party costs. Refreshments tend to be one of the bigger party expenses. In fact, the average cost of a cocktail party can range from $25 to $230 per person, according to CostHelper.com. Shelton suggests that hosts can cut costs by having guests bring food to pass and inviting home brewers to show off their skills in a brewing competition. Depending on how many people you’re inviting, these measures can save you a few hundred dollars on the cost of entertaining. Discover: The Ultimate $100 Dinner Party Menu AuKirk / Shutterstock.com 3. Hit the Dollar Store Give yourself a budget of $20 to $30 to buy goods at the dollar store, and you’ll be able to pick up a variety of Halloween-themed items — and non-holiday items — to take care of your guests. If you’re the crafty type, even better — you’ll find everything from wreaths to paper gift bags ready for painting or decorating. For example, Dollar Tree’s Halloween Headquarters is stocked with craft supplies, including plastic pumpkins, skulls, decorative candleholders and goblets for just a dollar a piece. You can use these items to put together an eye-catching centerpiece or decorate tables and mantels. And don’t forget the food aisle. You’ll find everything from cookies and bread to peanut butter, hot chocolate and other staples. Plus, bagged candy and other treats can be great for filling small bowls at the party table. Just make sure to check the expiration dates, and keep an eye out for any bulk buys to save even more on food costs. Kzenon / Shutterstock.com 4. Borrow Your Costume If you throw a Halloween party and want to dress up as a character from a movie or TV series, explore the idea of borrowing a costume from friends, family members or neighbors. See: DIY Halloween Kids Costumes for Under $10 You can post a request on your Facebook page or in a local Facebook Group to see if there is any interest. Some people might be willing to rent out their costumes in exchange for other products or services, like free meals or anything you might have in your garage that you want to give away. You can also make use of sites like NeighborGoods, which lets you create and join groups in your neighborhood to share anything from ladders for Halloween decorating to costumes. This can be a great way to save on the cost of a new costume, which can range from tens to hundreds of dollars via Amazon.com. Minerva Studio / Shutterstock.com 5. Take Advantage of ‘Buy 1, Get 1 Free’ Deals at Grocery Stores When you need to buy soda, bottled water, chips, salsa and other party favorites in larger quantities, shave off a significant amount of money with “buy one, get one free” deals at your local grocery store. Saving 50 percent on these items makes it that much easier to come in under budget. Since the deals rotate throughout the week — and will be different at every store — you might need to do some sale sleuthing to find great deals. Plan on hitting the store circuit at least a few weeks in advance, so you can get the best deals on different goods. And if you don’t feel like making a tour of the town to scoop up deals, consider using apps like Grocery Pal or Flipp, where you can get a preview of store circulars and coupons in a few screen swipes. These apps can also help you organize your shopping list and calculate total savings. dubassy / Shutterstock.com 6. Arrange for Live Music or a DJ — for Free If you’re organizing a larger party and want to keep guests entertained, having live music or a DJ setup at the event will make your party a standout. Ask musician friends or amateur DJs if they want to perform at your Halloween party in exchange for the publicity and a good time. Additionally, you can post requests on Facebook or even venture over to Craigslist to find someone who wants to play for free. Another option: Check out Meetup groups in your area that perform together, and get in touch with the organizer to see if the group wants to attend. Just make sure the performers will be bringing their own equipment and that they are prepared to sign liability waivers, so you aren’t left holding the bill if any equipment gets damaged. You could offer free food and drinks in exchange for their efforts, or return the favor by promoting them online.

PreviousNext Walmart Proposal Draws Curious to Business Park Open Houses By Joe DurwiniBerkshires Correspondent 03:21AM / Monday, September 19, 2016Print | Email The 15-acre Site 9 in the William Stanley Business Park is being considered for a Walmart Supercenter. PITTSFIELD, Mass. — The Walmart store proposed for the William Stanley Business Park has generated a lot of discussion didn't translate into an influx of visitors at the park. But those who did attend the three recent open houses expressed their interest and concerns about the controversial project. "I think everyone came with pretty much that focus in mind," said Pittsfield Economic Development Authority Executive Director Corydon Thurston, who told iBerkshires the three dates — held on Aug. 24, 31, and Sept. 14 — drew a combined crowd of "about a couple dozen." "Everyone that came wanted to see where [the proposed site] was, and how it would be oriented, and things of that nature," Thurston said. He added that along with its primary mission of generating interest in the developable parcels of the park, the tours were also an important part of PEDA's attempt to maintain public transparency. "We want people to feel comfortable, and know that we're not hiding anything," he said. "We're trying to do our best, and showcase the property." These three open houses follow an event in May focused specifically on the Waterstone Development proposal to site a 190,000 Walmart Supercenter on a challenged lot in the small urban business park near Tyler Street. Another public presentation will be held by Waterstone on Monday, Sept. 19, at 6 p.m. at Morningside School. Touring the business park, PEDA Board Chairman Mick Callahan outlined some of the many challenges to that particular piece of property, which includes millions of dollars in re-grading and remediation to be shovel-ready for any new development. On a typical "greensfield," or uncontaminated, site, Callahan noted, the average cost of development may range anywhere from $80,000 to $175,000 per acre. At the uniquely challenged "Teens" site (so dubbed because it once held General Electric buildings numbered in the teens), the cost will be closer to a half-million dollars per acre. Waterstone's current proposal to develop the site will total approximately $30 million to $32 million, an expenditure Callahan called "the largest private investment in Pittsfield in many years." Retail would be essentially limited to this portion of the business park in PEDA's emerging vision. Additional parcels on the East Street side of the park are more suited, he said, to "light industrial, office, and R&D uses," and the more buildable areas on this side of the rail line that segments the property could accommodate as many as a half dozen such companies, depending on their size. On the Kellogg Street side, across the newly opened Woodlawn Avenue Bridge, another small lot already contains a buildable foundation for a medium-size facility, what Callahan called "an affordable opportunity, that has a lot of possibility." "In the scheme of things, we're a very small business park, compared to a lot of what we're competing with," Callahan told iBerkshires. "Our goal is to build the tax base and create jobs." Not only does PEDA believe that Waterstone's Walmart proposal will address both goals, but the North Carolina-based developer has eluded to its interest in working with PEDA on other non-retail projects at the park. "Waterstone is a multi-dimensional developer that is now nationwide. They have industrial, commercial, warehousing, retail, and R&D," said Callahan, adding "we've also talked to them a bit about 'where do we go from here.'" In the meantime, PEDA remains open to all interested parties, and will arrange viewings for anyone who wants to know more. "We're happy to show people the property absolutely any time that we have time. They don't have to wait for an open house," said Thurston.

Walmart, Lowe's, and Whole Foods are banking on this to compete with Amazon Business Insider 9/18/2016 Kate Taylor © Provided by Business Insider lowebot The rise of automation in the fast-food industry has made headlines in recent months, as chains such as Panera and McDonald's have heavily invested in tech that threatens to eventually replace human workers. Robots can make sushi, noodles, burgers, and pancakes.  Quotes in the article Wal-Mart Stores Inc WMT ▼ 68.72 -0.47 -0.67% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 766.88 +10.48 +1.39% Whole Foods Market Inc WFM ▼ 30.88 -0.06 -0.19% Lowe's Companies Inc LOW ▲ 68.26 +0.31 +0.46% Now, the grocery and retail industry is looking to get in on automation, as well.     Walmart recently patented a system of self-driving shopping carts, with mini robots that can complete a long list of duties once reserved for human employees. These motorized units can potentially move containers; scan, retrieve, and deliver products; check inventory; retrieve trash; and even connect with customers. All this may sound like science fiction, but the automation of retail jobs isn't so far off.  In late August, Lowe's announced that, starting this fall, 11 locations in the San Francisco Bay Area will feature LoweBots, which are multi-lingual, autonomous customer assistance robots. In the grocery industry, self-checkout stands have become standard. And the industry is now looking for more ways to use tech to streamline shopping and minimize the need for human employees. © Provided by Business Insider 365 Whole Foods 365 stores, for example, have iPad kiosks that let customers order food from the on-site kitchen, iPads with digital scanners to provide details about wine, digital scales for weighing foods, and digital price tags. The reliance on tech over employees is intended to both cut costs — allowing for lower prices —and appeal to millennial shoppers. Retailers like Walmart say one of the major advantages of automation is a better customer experience.  "In a modern retail store environment, there is a need to improve the customer experience and/or convenience for the customer," Walmart's patent reads. © Provided by Business Insider Walmart patent Walmart's patent notes that robots could help solve some of it's major challenges, like insufficient staffing during peak hours, under-trained workers due to high-turnover rates, messy aisles, and theft — all things that can be addressed by utilizing robots. Robots also make good workers — they never need a vacation, never get sick, and arrive at work 100% trained. Customer experience is especially important for brick-and-mortar retailers in 2016, thanks to the growth of ecommerce sites such as Amazon. The online retailer is aiming to take over sectors from clothing to grocery — and companies are scared.  "With increasing competition from non-traditional shopping mechanisms, such as online shopping provided by e-commerce merchants and alternative store formats, it can be important for 'brick and mortar' retailers to focus on improving the overall customer experience and/or convenience," Walmart's patent notes.   Amazon's lack of physical stores has helped it thrive, as the company can avoid issues like long lines, lack of customer service, and stocking problems that retailer have to deal with. Amazon has arguably lead the charge toward automation. In 2014, the online retailer deployed Kiva robots across its warehouses to automate the retrieving and packaging process. Deutsche Bank says the machines save the company roughly $22 million at each fulfillment center.     At brick-and-mortar locations, automation also has the bonus of appealing to younger customers, a group that retailers are eager to attract. Nearly a third of people 18 to 24 would rather order from the drive-thru at restaurants because "they don't feel like dealing with people" according to a recent study by Frisch's Restaurants, which owns and franchises 120 Big Boy Restaurants. © Provided by Business Insider 365 That's part of the reason that retailers are investing in automation. Whole Food's 365 brand intends to win over millennials.     "There are a lot more options for people these days — whether it's groceries or restaurants or convenience stores — and 365 is our way of evolving," Jeff Turnas, president of 365 by Whole Foods Market, told Business Insider in April. While there are some clear benefits for investing in automation, the rise of the robot may cause problems for workers. A recent study from market research company Forrester predicts that, by 2021, robots will have eliminated 6% of all jobs in the US, reports the Guardian. © Provided by Business Insider Walmart The benefits of a more-fully automated store are getting more and more appealing as labor costs rise,  according to analysts. Walmart told Business Insider that any predictions about how investment in automation would impact workers was premature. However, as companies across the grocery and retail space invest in this technology, it is inevitable that shopping will involve more and more robots. And, as times goes on, that's likely to mean fewer and fewer human employees. Are you a retail worker or shopper that has been affected by automation?

Meaning that the Halloween spirit is looming over Walgreens — sometimes even off-season — and dollar stores across America, putting Walmart’s shoddy selection to shame for yet another year in a row. You can almost guarantee that this is how into the Halloween spirit Walmart is every year. Yeah. Just the ONE aisle. [Image by Jo Naylor | Flickr | CC BY 2.0] That’s right! Walmart. Once the envy of the Halloween decorations world; one would have thought that a big-box store such as Walmart would have put more effort into turning several aisles into a riveting Halloween shopping experience, expanding their ghosts and goblins section for the consumer. But sadly, they’re no longer committed to the holiday. Yes, it’s already a “plus” going to the dollar store anyway for just about anything you need, and because of that, the Halloween spirit goes a long way there. And if there is a dollar store closer to you than the nearest Walmart, save yourself a trip and hit it up first and you’ll be overwhelmed by their vast selection and “killer” savings, because you’re guaranteed to find things you never thought existed. And unlike Walmart — while they brag about being the “everything store,” they hardly have anything at all compared to — not just one, but two or more dollars stores. You can hit up Dollar General, Family Dollar, or any other dollar store you’ve probably been too afraid to enter, before the spooky season compels you to do so. A woman walks towards a Dollar General. She won’t be the same when she comes out! [Photo by Charles Krupa/AP Images] And really, in comparison, look at the size of that Walmart aisle. You would think they would go all the way for the season. You’ll be lucky if your Walmart has more than one aisle for spooky stuff. After all, the Halloween shopping life spans is just for a month and a half each year. If you still have doubts about the dollar stores, let The Consumer Queen set you straight. Even she throws a little “love” Walmart’s way. “You’ll still save lots of money over buying at Walmart and Target!” That still leaves CVS and Walgreens, who excel with their selection. Only the frequent shopper would know if they’re all carrying the same stuff, in which case they can stock up on backups and sometimes they’re even cheaper than that uninspired aisle of overpriced Walmart items. Walgreens has Nightmare Before Christmas stuff at the end of the aisle. Can you imagine what you’ll find on the aisle itself? [Image by Mike Mozart | Flickr | CC BY 2.0 ] Look, even Target is acceptable. They have a small section of dollar items when you walk in, which is worth checking out. Shoppers are always guaranteed to find some interesting and various off-kilter buys for the season. But for being such a small store, Walgreens has got the “goods,” and there’s more incentive to shop there because in general, it just feels good. Most Walmarts are sporadically unorganized and at times the buying experience, in general, almost feels like a chore. Similar to putting money in a snack machine at a public place, where you have to cripple your hands just trying to get something in your stomach. The main difference between Walmart and all of the other stores during Halloween, is that Walmart is more about convenience, which they certainly have down to a science, but because of their high-volume attitude, they’re hardly friendly. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FjZpmnjwJxs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> And yes, Halloween is about chills, spookiness, and scary stuff, but it doesn’t look like they were having much fun when they put up the displays. There’s a disconnect between the fun that’s supposed to haunt an impressive Halloween section, to the stressful experience at the check-out line where there are never enough people to scan purchases, and even less people to help those in the self-check out line. Most everyone going to a Walmart isn’t necessarily looking forward to it. *walking past Walmart's Halloween section* LOOK CHRISTMAS! — Jose Hurtado (@ActorTwin) September 8, 2016 So there you have it. Walmart doesn’t have as much to offer as some of the other mentioned stores, so don’t waste any time and grab up some Halloween goodies before someone else does. What are your thoughts? Do you feel that Halloween just isn’t happening at your local Walmart?

News Nation & World In Jim Cooley’s open-carry America, even a trip to Walmart can require an AR-15 Jim Cooley Jabin Botsford / The Washington Post Jim Cooley carries his AR-15 semiautomatic rifle into his home after having it fixed. Cooley almost never leaves his home unarmed. Jim Cooley carries his AR-15 semiautomatic rifle into his home after having it fixed. Cooley almost never leaves his home unarmed. (Jabin Botsford / The Washington Post) Terrence McCoyWashington Post All Jim Cooley wants to do is buy some soda. "You want to come to Walmart?" he asks his wife. "No," Maria says. "Pretty please?" Jim asks. "I'm not going to sit there and have the police called on you. I mean, I don't want to see that crap," Maria says, knowing what a trip to Walmart means. She knows her 51-year-old husband has two guns inside the house, and this afternoon it won't be the 9mm, which he straps on with a round in the chamber when grabbing lunch at his favorite fast-food restaurant or visiting a friend's auto shop. It'll be the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, which he brings when going somewhere he thinks is dangerous, like the Atlanta airport, where he's taken it loaded with a 100-bullet drum, or Walmart, where he thinks crowds could pose an easy targets for terrorists. In a country of relaxing gun laws where it's now legal to open-carry in 45 states and there are 14.5 million people with carry permits, every day seems to bring a new version of what open carry can mean. In Kentucky, it's now legal to open-carry in city buildings. In downtown Cleveland, people carried military-style rifles during the Republican National Convention. In Howell, Michigan, last month, a father went openly armed to his child's middle-school orientation. In Mississippi, it's now legal to open-carry without a permit at all. And in Georgia, which has passed a "guns everywhere" bill and has issued nearly 1 million carry permits, Jim Cooley is staking out his version of what's acceptable as he keeps pleading with his wife. "I got to get soda." Maria sighs. She worked the night before assembling air-conditioner compressors at a nearby factory, and in a few hours, she knows she'll have to leave for another third shift. "Yeah," she says, giving in. "I might as well get this travesty out of the way." "What travesty?" "You carrying a big ol' rifle in the store, scaring the hell out of all the Walmart shoppers." "There's no difference between carrying a rifle and carrying a handgun," he says. "You tried that last time, remember?" Maria says, stepping into a pair of flip-flops and running her fingers through her hair. "And what happened? Barrow County sheriffs. Three or four of them." "They can't tell me what and what not to carry," Jim says. "You know I wouldn't listen to them anyway." "Well, you go one way in the store; I'll go the other," Maria says. "Then when they say, 'Ma'am, do you know this person?' I'll say, 'No, I've never seen him before in my life.' " He places a lit cigarette into an ashtray, walks into his bedroom, reaches behind its door, picks up the AR-15, snaps in a magazine with 15 rounds, and slings the rifle around his left shoulder so it rests against his torso. "Ready?" he asks. "Yeah," she says, grabbing her purse and following her husband out the door for an afternoon trip to Walmart to buy soda. Jim Cooley Jabin Botsford / The Washington Post Jim Cooley smokes a cigarette as he rests after doing errands at his home in Winder, Ga.  Jim Cooley smokes a cigarette as he rests after doing errands at his home in Winder, Ga.  (Jabin Botsford / The Washington Post) The gun Jim Cooley carries is the ATI Omni-Hybrid Maxx AR-15 semiautomatic rifle. It cost him $579.99. It weighs 6.25 pounds, is 35 inches long, and fires bullets as fast as the trigger can be pulled, and, as Jim has learned, fits nicely between the front seats of a white minivan with peeling paint on the front and a bumper sticker on the back that says, "I (heart) Law." Jim goes everywhere now with a gun - if not the AR-15, then his sidearm - and is so reliant on one being close by that it surprises him to think the majority of his life was lived otherwise. He was raised in a working-class family in Chicago, where he can't imagine living now because of its strict gun laws. But they didn't bother him then. He didn't hunt. He didn't fear for his safety. If his dad had a gun, no one knew. He grew up without a gun, went to church without a gun, married Maria without a gun, began raising two children without a gun, and settled into a life that felt as safe as it was dependable. But then it began unraveling, starting when he was fired from a trucking job days after telling Maria, who was pregnant with their first child, to quit her job and focus on the baby, that he could support them both. Their first bankruptcy filing wasn't far behind, then the second, and the third, and then they were moving to Florida, where Maria had family and where Jim got a job with a grocery chain. It transferred him to Winder, and he moved the family into a middle-class neighborhood struggling with crime and drugs. Jim now steers past the house of a neighbor who sold him his first gun - a .380 semiautomatic for $100 - so he could protect his family from that crime, then past Winder's only gun shop where he took his dad so he could buy a gun, too. He lights a cigarette, feels the breeze from an open window because the air conditioner is broken, and takes a sip of soda from a big mug that says Athens Regional Medical Center. It's a memento of sorts from the day in late 2008 when he emerged from that hospital with three stents in his heart, debts worth $41,052.51 and a dawning realization he was now disabled, broke and would never work again. After the heart attack, he lost most of the circulation in his legs, received three more stents and started using an electric scooter whenever he had to walk long distances. He told Maria he was all used up, a drag on the family. She should think about leaving him. But she wouldn't, even after the hospital sued him for unpaid medical bills, even after he was arrested when he carried his .380 outside a school board meeting, even after he came home one day with an AR-15. He shot it at a nearby firing range and, feeling a sense of control that had gone missing in his life, told Maria he could now keep the family safe. She now sits at his side, as always, in the passenger seat. At first, she didn't understand the changes she saw in the man she married 24 years ago. Why did he suddenly want a gun when he never mentioned one before? Why did he want her to get one, too? Why did he put two four-inch knives inside the car's passenger-side door? And why all the security cameras? Maria glances at a small screen beneath the rearview mirror: It shows feeds from surveillance cameras affixed inside the car that start recording when someone turns the ignition. Jim Cooley Jabin Botsford / The Washington Post Jim Cooley drives his van with five security cameras recording to the grocery store in Winder, Ga. Cooley almost never leaves his home unarmed.  Jim Cooley drives his van with five security cameras recording to the grocery store in Winder, Ga. Cooley almost never leaves his home unarmed.  (Jabin Botsford / The Washington Post) But Maria went along with all of it. She bought a .380 semiautomatic and has gotten used to taking it with her wherever she goes. She got used to the cameras, too, including the seven Jim placed around the house's perimeter. She began to understand why he was so concerned about crime, about terrorists, about the need to protect their family because they couldn't count on the government to do it for them. Last year, when he showed her his new AR-15 and asked her to shoot it, she did, feeling intimidated afterward. But then she did it again. And when he started bringing the rifle not just to the range, but to Atlanta, to the airport, inside Walmart, she eventually went along with that, too. So much of her life involves accommodating him now, including just before they left for Walmart and he asked her to send a Facebook message to a local deputy about his plans. "What do you want me to tell him?" Maria had asked. "Say, 'Hey, buddy, I'm going to Walmart, and I'm going to have my AR with me, so if any call comes over the radio, you know it's me," Jim told her. Maria sat at a laptop in a bedroom cluttered with stacks of documents, some of which detailed foreclosure proceedings against the house, and saw the browser had 35 tabs open. One was a YouTube video of something called "Police State 101." Another showed the dictionary definition of the word "law." Another was a fringe website her husband classifies as "underground," the sort he started visiting more frequently after he joined a Georgia militia in late 2014 and decided it was up to him to protect his family from foreign and government threats. She messaged the deputy, then looked at Jim's Facebook page. It bore pictures of her husband carrying guns and posts about a country dissolving into chaos and videos about people stopping intruders with guns, people killing burglars with guns, people shooting big guns, small guns, all kinds of guns, that he watches late into the night. She came back to the kitchen table, where Jim sat and smoked. "At least I notified the sheriff's department ahead of time," he said. He looked at Maria. "Come on, come to Walmart with me," he said. "I got to get soda." So she went along with that, too, and now here she is, pulling into a parking spot outside Walmart, and her husband is reaching for an AR-15 that he tells her sometimes he would have no problem using against a thief breaking into their house, or a violent protester in the streets of Milwaukee, or a terrorist in Syria, or, if necessary, even a stray dog on their lawn. Jim Cooley Jabin Botsford / The Washington Post Jim Cooley stands for a portrait with his AR-15 semiautomatic rifle at his home in Winder, Ga.  Jim Cooley stands for a portrait with his AR-15 semiautomatic rifle at his home in Winder, Ga.  (Jabin Botsford / The Washington Post) The Walmart Supercenter is outside of downtown Winder, next to the Subway, the Great Clips, the GameStop, and buffered by a parking lot that can easily fit hundreds of cars, but is rarely more than half-full on weekdays. There are two entrances. One is beside the landscaping section and says "Home and Garden" above the doorway. The other, which Jim now walks through, leads to another Subway, this one just inside the supercenter. As Maria goes ahead, Jim veers to the right, where he climbs into a complimentary electric scooter, repositions his AR-15 so its barrel points toward the scuffed vinyl floor, and rolls into the store. "Hey, Maria," he calls when catching up to her. "Do we need any lunch meat?" "I'll go get some salami," she says. "All right," he says, now alone, and accelerates the scooter deeper into the store, crossing into the grocery section. Two middle-aged women stand beside a refrigerator, talking. One of them looks at Jim, sees the gun around his neck and goes silent. The other woman turns, and when she sees the gun, her expression freezes, too. But it's not the fearful looks that Jim notices as he rolls past. It's a nearby sale. "Eighty-eight cents for a loaf," he says and keeps moving toward the back of the store. Not everyone sees his AR-15, which is partially obscured by the cart. One man walks past without a second look. So does a woman, making her way into the clothing section. One couple give Jim wide berth, their eyes on his scooter and, briefly, his gun. And then Jim gets where he's going - the soda aisle - and sees what he's looking for. He reaches out and, grunting, pulls free a 24-pack of Diet Dr. Thunder. Trying not to jostle the AR-15, he leans forward and, twisting awkwardly, drops the box into the scooter's front cart, accidentally tearing it open. "They don't make these things like they used to," he says quietly and grabs another 24-pack of Diet Dr. Thunder, placing this one inside the cart more gently. In search of Maria, he continues into the dairy section, where he wheels past a father and his young daughter who stares at his rifle, into aisle 9, where he puts a large can of Great Value Classic Roast Coffee into his cart, and finally back to the front of the supercenter, where he sees Maria ordering salami. She takes the soda and coffee out of his cart and places it in her own. She gestures at a nearby cheesecake. "They got strawberry swirl," she says. He is leaning forward. The muzzle of the loaded gun is pressing against his shoe. Now it's sliding under his shoelaces. "Give me the strawberry swirl," he says, and as Maria heads toward the checkout line with the cheesecake, the salami, the coffee and the soda, he straightens up and the muzzle slides free of his shoe. He steers toward the front doors, parks the scooter, slowly stands and walks outside, and that's when a group of employees standing just outside the entrance notices the gun. "Is that what I see?" one will later recall saying. "What do we do if he comes in the store?" "If someone feels uncomfortable, what can we do?" They continue staring as Jim walks into the parking lot toward the car. "You know my grandfather was murdered, right?" one of the employees says, and as they launch into a discussion of a robbery and shooting that happened in 1973, they are in the midst of a late summer afternoon in 2016 with its own set of shootings. In California, by the end of this day, a 61-year-old man will have been shot to death at a carwash. In Virginia, an intruder will have burst into a home and killed a 24-year-old man inside. In Missouri, a woman will have shot and killed a man she said was chasing her. And meanwhile, in Georgia, Jim is braking hard on the ride home, causing his AR-15 to topple forward. "Can you hold onto that for me, please?" he asks Maria. "Yeah," she says, putting the gun back where it was, and without further incident they continue on their way home, where Jim puts away his AR-15, sits down at the kitchen table and takes a drink of Diet Dr. Thunder.

 Walmart, Lowe's, and Whole Foods are banking on this to compete with Amazon Kate Taylor Sep. 18, 2016, 5:15 PM 27,361 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Lowe's LoweBot. Lowe's The rise of automation in the fast-food industry has made headlines in recent months, as chains such as Panera and McDonald's have heavily invested in tech that threatens to eventually replace human workers. Robots can make sushi, noodles, burgers, and pancakes. Now the grocery and retail industry is looking to get in on automation as well. Walmart recently patented a system of self-driving shopping carts with mini robots that can complete a long list of duties once reserved for human employees. These motorized units can potentially move containers; scan, retrieve, and deliver products; check inventory; retrieve trash; and even connect with customers. All this may sound like science fiction, but the automation of retail jobs isn't so far off. In late August, Lowe's announced that, starting this fall, 11 locations in the San Francisco Bay Area will feature LoweBots, which are multilingual, autonomous customer assistance robots. In the grocery industry, self-checkout stands have become standard. And the industry is now looking for more ways to use tech to streamline shopping and minimize the need for human employees. Whole Foods 365's ordering kiosks. Reuters Whole Foods 365 stores, for example, have iPad kiosks that let customers order food from the on-site kitchen, iPads with digital scanners to provide details about wine, digital scales for weighing foods, and digital price tags. The reliance on tech over employees is intended to both cut costs — allowing for lower prices —and appeal to millennial shoppers. Retailers like Walmart say one of the major advantages of automation is a better customer experience. "In a modern retail store environment, there is a need to improve the customer experience and/or convenience for the customer," Walmart's patent reads. Images of the self-driving shopping carts from Walmart's patent. US Patent and Trademark Office Walmart's patent notes that robots could help solve some of its major challenges, like insufficient staffing during peak hours, workers who are undertrained because of high turnover rates, messy aisles, and theft — all things that could be addressed by using robots. Robots also make good workers — they never need a vacation, never get sick, and arrive at work 100% trained. Customer experience is especially important for brick-and-mortar retailers in 2016, thanks to the growth of e-commerce sites such as Amazon. The online retailer is aiming to take over sectors from clothing to grocery — and companies are scared. "With increasing competition from nontraditional shopping mechanisms, such as online shopping provided by e-commerce merchants and alternative store formats, it can be important for 'brick and mortar' retailers to focus on improving the overall customer experience and/or convenience," Walmart's patent reads. Amazon's lack of physical stores has helped it thrive, as the company can avoid issues — like long lines, lack of customer service, and stocking problems — that retailers have to deal with. Amazon has arguably led the charge toward automation. In 2014, the online retailer deployed Kiva robots across its warehouses to automate the retrieving and packaging process. Deutsche Bank says the machines save the company roughly $22 million at each fulfillment center. At brick-and-mortar locations, automation also has the bonus of appealing to younger customers — a group that retailers are eager to attract. Nearly a third of people ages 18 to 24 would rather order from the drive-thru at restaurants because "they don't feel like dealing with people," according to a recent study by Frisch's Restaurants, which owns and franchises 120 Big Boy Restaurants. Whole Foods 365's express digital checkout stands. Reuters That's part of the reason that retailers are investing in automation. Whole Foods' 365 brand intends to win over millennials. "There are a lot more options for people these days — whether it's groceries or restaurants or convenience stores — and 365 is our way of evolving," Jeff Turnas, president of 365 by Whole Foods Market, told Business Insider in April. While there are some clear benefits for investing in automation, the rise of the robot may cause problems for workers. A recent study from market research company Forrester predicts that by 2021, robots will have eliminated 6% of all jobs in the US, The Guardian reports. Joe Raedle/Getty Images The benefits of a more automated store are getting more and more appealing as labor costs rise, according to analysts. Walmart told Business Insider that any predictions about how investment in automation would affect workers was premature. However, as companies across the grocery and retail space invest in this technology, it is inevitable that shopping will involve more and more robots. And, as times goes on, that's likely to mean fewer and fewer human employees. Are you a retail worker or shopper that has been affected by automation?

McIntyre September 18, 2016 8:29 am EST Print Email Tweet Walmart (NYSE: WMT) started its layaway programs well in advance of the holiday season. Count backward from December 25 to its September 2 inception, and the period becomes a large fraction of the year. One of the hallmark’s of this year’s program is that the minimum needed to start a program is again only $10. The retailer stressed this particularly when it announced details. There is no opening fee for customers to start a layaway account and they only need to put down 10% (or $10, whichever is greater). Walmart has kept its minimum threshold again this year. Customers can put items as low as $10 on layaway with a $50 minimum basket. Customers have until Dec. 12 to pay off their account. Walmart almost always knows more about the bricks and mortar part of retailer world than anyone else, based on its shear size. If the company believed it could increase the $10 minimum to cut risks on a $50 layaway program, it would. Data must show not enough customers are flush enough to be able to do that, without losing part of its holiday buyer base. And holding that base is important, and profitable. According to MarketWatch, While some people wait for Black Friday deals to start their holiday shopping, many customers started using layaway programs weeks ago. Those shoppers, experts say, have likely been to the store more than once to make payments since, creating a valuable form of customer loyalty. Seventeen percent of shoppers will take advantage of a layaway program this holiday season, according to Deloitte. These programs, in which shoppers reserve products they receive after paying for them over time, give retailers with a way to reach lower-middle and low-income consumers, said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at The NPD Group. And creating a customer that has to keep coming back throughout the holiday season is a benefit of these programs. “Every time you come in to pay, [retailers] have the opportunity to talk to you, market to you, upsell you,” Cohen said. “It’s the opportunity to create the ultimate loyal consumer.” Perhaps better, for customer loyalty success than Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Prime. By almost every measure, Walmart shoppers, on average, have lower incomes than other retailers. Lawaway become a necessity to hold customers, and is also the ultimate way to get the next sales I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Douglas A.

Cooley almost never leaves his home unarmed. Posted: Sunday, September 18, 2016 8:00 am In some parts of open-carry America, even a trip to Walmart can require an AR-15. By Terrence McCoy The Washington Post SentinelSource.com WINDER, Ga. — All Jim Cooley wants to do is buy some soda. “You want to come to Walmart?” he asks his wife. “No,” Maria says. “Pretty please?” Jim asks. “I’m not going to sit there and have the police called on you. I mean, I don’t want to see that crap,” Maria says, knowing what a trip to Walmart means. She knows her 51-year-old husband has two guns inside the house, and this afternoon it won’t be the 9mm, which he straps on with a round in the chamber when grabbing lunch at his favorite fast-food restaurant or visiting a friend’s auto shop. It’ll be the AR-15 semiautomatic rifle, which he brings when going somewhere he thinks is dangerous, like the Atlanta airport, where he’s taken it loaded with a 100-bullet drum, or Walmart, where he thinks crowds could pose an easy targets for terrorists. In a country of relaxing gun laws where it’s now legal to open-carry in 45 states and there are 14.5 million people with carry permits, every day seems to bring a new version of what open carry can mean. In Kentucky, it’s now legal to open-carry in city buildings. In downtown Cleveland, people carried military-style rifles during the Republican National Convention. In Howell, Michigan, last month, a father went openly armed to his child’s middle-school orientation. In Mississippi, it’s now legal to open-carry without a permit at all. And in Georgia, which has passed a “guns everywhere” bill and has issued nearly 1 million carry permits, Jim Cooley is staking out his version of what’s acceptable as he keeps pleading with his wife. “I got to get soda.” Maria sighs. She worked the night before assembling air-conditioner compressors at a nearby factory, and in a few hours, she knows she’ll have to leave for another third shift. “Yeah,” she says, giving in. “I might as well get this travesty out of the way.” “What travesty?” “You carrying a big ol’ rifle in the store, scaring the hell out of all the Walmart shoppers.” “There’s no difference between carrying a rifle and carrying a handgun,” he says. “You tried that last time, remember?” Maria says, stepping into a pair of flip-flops and running her fingers through her hair. “And what happened? Barrow County sheriffs. Three or four of them.” “They can’t tell me what and what not to carry,” Jim says. “You know I wouldn’t listen to them anyway.” “Well, you go one way in the store; I’ll go the other,” Maria says. “Then when they say, ‘Ma’am, do you know this person?’ I’ll say, ‘No, I’ve never seen him before in my life.’ “ He places a lit cigarette into an ashtray, walks into his bedroom, reaches behind its door, picks up the AR-15, snaps in a magazine with 15 rounds, and slings the rifle around his left shoulder so it rests against his torso. “Ready?” he asks. “Yeah,” she says, grabbing her purse and following her husband out the door for an afternoon trip to Walmart to buy soda. - — - The gun Jim Cooley carries is the ATI Omni-Hybrid Maxx AR-15 semiautomatic rifle. It cost him $579.99. It weighs 6.25 pounds, is 35 inches long, and fires bullets as fast as the trigger can be pulled, and, as Jim has learned, fits nicely between the front seats of a white minivan with peeling paint on the front and a bumper sticker on the back that says, “I (heart) Law.” Jim goes everywhere now with a gun — if not the AR-15, then his sidearm — and is so reliant on one being close by that it surprises him to think the majority of his life was lived otherwise. He was raised in a working-class family in Chicago, where he can’t imagine living now because of its strict gun laws. But they didn’t bother him then. He didn’t hunt. He didn’t fear for his safety. If his dad had a gun, no one knew. He grew up without a gun, went to church without a gun, married Maria without a gun, began raising two children without a gun, and settled into a life that felt as safe as it was dependable. But then it began unraveling, starting when he was fired from a trucking job days after telling Maria, who was pregnant with their first child, to quit her job and focus on the baby, that he could support them both. Their first bankruptcy filing wasn’t far behind, then the second, and the third, and then they were moving to Florida, where Maria had family and where Jim got a job with a grocery chain. It transferred him to Winder, and he moved the family into a middle-class neighborhood struggling with crime and drugs. Jim now steers past the house of a neighbor who sold him his first gun — a .380 semiautomatic for $100 — so he could protect his family from that crime, then past Winder’s only gun shop where he took his dad so he could buy a gun, too. He lights a cigarette, feels the breeze from an open window because the air conditioner is broken, and takes a sip of soda from a big mug that says Athens Regional Medical Center. It’s a memento of sorts from the day in late 2008 when he emerged from that hospital with three stents in his heart, debts worth $41,052.51 and a dawning realization he was now disabled, broke and would never work again. After the heart attack, he lost most of the circulation in his legs, received three more stents and started using an electric scooter whenever he had to walk long distances. He told Maria he was all used up, a drag on the family. She should think about leaving him. But she wouldn’t, even after the hospital sued him for unpaid medical bills, even after he was arrested when he carried his .380 outside a school board meeting, even after he came home one day with an AR-15. He shot it at a nearby firing range and, feeling a sense of control that had gone missing in his life, told Maria he could now keep the family safe. She now sits at his side, as always, in the passenger seat. At first, she didn’t understand the changes she saw in the man she married 24 years ago. Why did he suddenly want a gun when he never mentioned one before? Why did he want her to get one, too? Why did he put two four-inch knives inside the car’s passenger-side door? And why all the security cameras? Maria glances at a small screen beneath the rearview mirror: It shows feeds from surveillance cameras affixed inside the car that start recording when someone turns the ignition. - — - But Maria went along with all of it. She bought a .380 semiautomatic and has gotten used to taking it with her wherever she goes. She got used to the cameras, too, including the seven Jim placed around the house’s perimeter. She began to understand why he was so concerned about crime, about terrorists, about the need to protect their family because they couldn’t count on the government to do it for them. Last year, when he showed her his new AR-15 and asked her to shoot it, she did, feeling intimidated afterward. But then she did it again. And when he started bringing the rifle not just to the range, but to Atlanta, to the airport, inside Walmart, she eventually went along with that, too. So much of her life involves accommodating him now, including just before they left for Walmart and he asked her to send a Facebook message to a local deputy about his plans. “What do you want me to tell him?” Maria had asked. “Say, ‘Hey, buddy, I’m going to Walmart, and I’m going to have my AR with me, so if any call comes over the radio, you know it’s me,” Jim told her. Maria sat at a laptop in a bedroom cluttered with stacks of documents, some of which detailed foreclosure proceedings against the house, and saw the browser had 35 tabs open. One was a YouTube video of something called “Police State 101.” Another showed the dictionary definition of the word “law.” Another was a fringe website her husband classifies as “underground,” the sort he started visiting more frequently after he joined a Georgia militia in late 2014 and decided it was up to him to protect his family from foreign and government threats. She messaged the deputy, then looked at Jim’s Facebook page. It bore pictures of her husband carrying guns and posts about a country dissolving into chaos and videos about people stopping intruders with guns, people killing burglars with guns, people shooting big guns, small guns, all kinds of guns, that he watches late into the night. She came back to the kitchen table, where Jim sat and smoked. “At least I notified the sheriff’s department ahead of time,” he said. He looked at Maria. “Come on, come to Walmart with me,” he said. “I got to get soda.” So she went along with that, too, and now here she is, pulling into a parking spot outside Walmart, and her husband is reaching for an AR-15 that he tells her sometimes he would have no problem using against a thief breaking into their house, or a violent protester in the streets of Milwaukee, or a terrorist in Syria, or, if necessary, even a stray dog on their lawn. - — - The Walmart Supercenter is outside of downtown Winder, next to the Subway, the Great Clips, the GameStop, and buffered by a parking lot that can easily fit hundreds of cars, but is rarely more than half-full on weekdays. There are two entrances. One is beside the landscaping section and says “Home and Garden” above the doorway. The other, which Jim now walks through, leads to another Subway, this one just inside the supercenter. As Maria goes ahead, Jim veers to the right, where he climbs into a complimentary electric scooter, repositions his AR-15 so its barrel points toward the scuffed vinyl floor, and rolls into the store. “Hey, Maria,” he calls when catching up to her. “Do we need any lunch meat?” “I’ll go get some salami,” she says. “All right,” he says, now alone, and accelerates the scooter deeper into the store, crossing into the grocery section. Two middle-aged women stand beside a refrigerator, talking. One of them looks at Jim, sees the gun around his neck and goes silent. The other woman turns, and when she sees the gun, her expression freezes, too. But it’s not the fearful looks that Jim notices as he rolls past. It’s a nearby sale. “Eighty-eight cents for a loaf,” he says and keeps moving toward the back of the store. Not everyone sees his AR-15, which is partially obscured by the cart. One man walks past without a second look. So does a woman, making her way into the clothing section. One couple give Jim wide berth, their eyes on his scooter and, briefly, his gun. And then Jim gets where he’s going — the soda aisle — and sees what he’s looking for. He reaches out and, grunting, pulls free a 24-pack of Diet Dr. Thunder. Trying not to jostle the AR-15, he leans forward and, twisting awkwardly, drops the box into the scooter’s front cart, accidentally tearing it open. “They don’t make these things like they used to,” he says quietly and grabs another 24-pack of Diet Dr. Thunder, placing this one inside the cart more gently. In search of Maria, he continues into the dairy section, where he wheels past a father and his young daughter who stares at his rifle, into aisle 9, where he puts a large can of Great Value Classic Roast Coffee into his cart, and finally back to the front of the supercenter, where he sees Maria ordering salami. She takes the soda and coffee out of his cart and places it in her own. She gestures at a nearby cheesecake. “They got strawberry swirl,” she says. He is leaning forward. The muzzle of the loaded gun is pressing against his shoe. Now it’s sliding under his shoelaces. “Give me the strawberry swirl,” he says, and as Maria heads toward the checkout line with the cheesecake, the salami, the coffee and the soda, he straightens up and the muzzle slides free of his shoe. He steers toward the front doors, parks the scooter, slowly stands and walks outside, and that’s when a group of employees standing just outside the entrance notices the gun. “Is that what I see?” one will later recall saying. “What do we do if he comes in the store?” “If someone feels uncomfortable, what can we do?” They continue staring as Jim walks into the parking lot toward the car. “You know my grandfather was murdered, right?” one of the employees says, and as they launch into a discussion of a robbery and shooting that happened in 1973, they are in the midst of a late summer afternoon in 2016 with its own set of shootings. In California, by the end of this day, a 61-year-old man will have been shot to death at a carwash. In Virginia, an intruder will have burst into a home and killed a 24-year-old man inside. In Missouri, a woman will have shot and killed a man she said was chasing her. And meanwhile, in Georgia, Jim is braking hard on the ride home, causing his AR-15 to topple forward. “Can you hold onto that for me, please?” he asks Maria. “Yeah,” she says, putting the gun back where it was, and without further incident they continue on their way home, where Jim puts away his AR-15, sits down at the kitchen table and takes a drink of Diet Dr. Thunder.

Jim now steers past the house of a neighbor who sold him his first gun - a .380 semiautomatic for $100 - so he could protect his family from that crime, then past Winder's only gun shop where he took his dad so he could buy a gun, too. He lights a cigarette, feels the breeze from an open window because the air conditioner is broken, and takes a sip of soda from a big mug that says Athens Regional Medical Center. It's a memento of sorts from the day in late 2008 when he emerged from that hospital with three stents in his heart, debts worth $41,052.51 and a dawning realization he was now disabled, broke and would never work again. After the heart attack, he lost most of the circulation in his legs, received three more stents and started using an electric scooter whenever he had to walk long distances. He told Maria he was all used up, a drag on the family. She should think about leaving him. But she wouldn't, even after the hospital sued him for unpaid medical bills, even after he was arrested when he carried his .380 outside a school board meeting, even after he came home one day with an AR-15. He shot it at a nearby firing range and, feeling a sense of control that had gone missing in his life, told Maria he could now keep the family safe. She now sits at his side, as always, in the passenger seat. At first, she didn't understand the changes she saw in the man she married 24 years ago. Why did he suddenly want a gun when he never mentioned one before? Why did he want her to get one, too? Why did he put two four-inch knives inside the car's passenger-side door? And why all the security cameras? Maria glances at a small screen beneath the rearview mirror: It shows feeds from surveillance cameras affixed inside the car that start recording when someone turns the ignition.

Photo / The Washington Post/ Jabin Botsford But Maria went along with all of it. She bought a .380 semiautomatic and has gotten used to taking it with her wherever she goes. She got used to the cameras, too, including the seven Jim placed around the house's perimeter. She began to understand why he was so concerned about crime, about terrorists, about the need to protect their family because they couldn't count on the government to do it for them. Last year, when he showed her his new AR-15 and asked her to shoot it, she did, feeling intimidated afterward. But then she did it again. And when he started bringing the rifle not just to the range, but to Atlanta, to the airport, inside Walmart, she eventually went along with that, too. So much of her life involves accommodating him now, including just before they left for Walmart and he asked her to send a Facebook message to a local deputy about his plans. "What do you want me to tell him?" Maria had asked. "Say, 'Hey, buddy, I'm going to Walmart, and I'm going to have my AR with me, so if any call comes over the radio, you know it's me," Jim told her. Maria sat at a laptop in a bedroom cluttered with stacks of documents, some of which detailed foreclosure proceedings against the house, and saw the browser had 35 tabs open. One was a YouTube video of something called "Police State 101." Another showed the dictionary definition of the word "law." Another was a fringe website her husband classifies as "underground," the sort he started visiting more frequently after he joined a Georgia militia in late 2014 and decided it was up to him to protect his family from foreign and government threats. She messaged the deputy, then looked at Jim's Facebook page. It bore pictures of her husband carrying guns and posts about a country dissolving into chaos and videos about people stopping intruders with guns, people killing burglars with guns, people shooting big guns, small guns, all kinds of guns, that he watches late into the night. She came back to the kitchen table, where Jim sat and smoked. "At least I notified the sheriff's department ahead of time," he said. He looked at Maria. "Come on, come to Walmart with me," he said. "I got to get soda." So she went along with that, too, and now here she is, pulling into a parking spot outside Walmart, and her husband is reaching for an AR-15 that he tells her sometimes he would have no problem using against a thief breaking into their house, or a violent protester in the streets of Milwaukee, or a terrorist in Syria, or, if necessary, even a stray dog on their lawn. Jim Cooley stands for a portrait with his AR-15 semiautomatic rifle at his home. Photo / The Washington Post / Jabin Botsford The Walmart Supercenter is outside of downtown Winder, next to the Subway, the Great Clips, the GameStop, and buffered by a parking lot that can easily fit hundreds of cars, but is rarely more than half-full on weekdays. There are two entrances. One is beside the landscaping section and says "Home and Garden" above the doorway. The other, which Jim now walks through, leads to another Subway, this one just inside the supercenter. As Maria goes ahead, Jim veers to the right, where he climbs into a complimentary electric scooter, repositions his AR-15 so its barrel points toward the scuffed vinyl floor, and rolls into the store. "Hey, Maria," he calls when catching up to her. "Do we need any lunch meat?" "I'll go get some salami," she says. "All right," he says, now alone, and accelerates the scooter deeper into the store, crossing into the grocery section. Two middle-aged women stand beside a refrigerator, talking. One of them looks at Jim, sees the gun around his neck and goes silent. The other woman turns, and when she sees the gun, her expression freezes, too. But it's not the fearful looks that Jim notices as he rolls past. It's a nearby sale. "Eighty-eight cents for a loaf," he says and keeps moving toward the back of the store. Not everyone sees his AR-15, which is partially obscured by the cart. One man walks past without a second look. So does a woman, making her way into the clothing section. One couple give Jim wide berth, their eyes on his scooter and, briefly, his gun. And then Jim gets where he's going - the soda aisle - and sees what he's looking for. He reaches out and, grunting, pulls free a 24-pack of Diet Dr. Thunder. Trying not to jostle the AR-15, he leans forward and, twisting awkwardly, drops the box into the scooter's front cart, accidentally tearing it open. "They don't make these things like they used to," he says quietly and grabs another 24-pack of Diet Dr. Thunder, placing this one inside the cart more gently. In search of Maria, he continues into the dairy section, where he wheels past a father and his young daughter who stares at his rifle, into aisle 9, where he puts a large can of Great Value Classic Roast Coffee into his cart, and finally back to the front of the supercenter, where he sees Maria ordering salami. She takes the soda and coffee out of his cart and places it in her own. She gestures at a nearby cheesecake. "They got strawberry swirl," she says. He is leaning forward. The muzzle of the loaded gun is pressing against his shoe. Now it's sliding under his shoelaces. "Give me the strawberry swirl," he says, and as Maria heads toward the checkout line with the cheesecake, the salami, the coffee and the soda, he straightens up and the muzzle slides free of his shoe. He steers toward the front doors, parks the scooter, slowly stands and walks outside, and that's when a group of employees standing just outside the entrance notices the gun. "Is that what I see?" one will later recall saying. "What do we do if he comes in the store?" "If someone feels uncomfortable, what can we do?" They continue staring as Jim walks into the parking lot toward the car. "You know my grandfather was murdered, right?" one of the employees says, and as they launch into a discussion of a robbery and shooting that happened in 1973, they are in the midst of a late summer afternoon in 2016 with its own set of shootings. In California, by the end of this day, a 61-year-old man will have been shot to death at a carwash. In Virginia, an intruder will have burst into a home and killed a 24-year-old man inside. In Missouri, a woman will have shot and killed a man she said was chasing her. And meanwhile, in Georgia, Jim is braking hard on the ride home, causing his AR-15 to topple forward. "Can you hold onto that for me, please?" he asks Maria. "Yeah," she says, putting the gun back where it was, and without further incident they continue on their way home, where Jim puts away his AR-15, sits down at the kitchen table and takes a drink of Diet Dr. Thunder. - Washington Post By Terrence McCoy Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Wyn Drabble: Xmas shopping made easy Trade Me can help you with your Christmas shopping.

According to Mississippi County Sheriff Keith Moore, Joseph Phillip Latamondeer, 40, of East Prairie, was taken into custody on Thursday afternoon, September 22. Sheriff Moore said Latamondeer was at his dad's home in Mississippi County when he was arrested around 4:30 p.m. The sheriff's department had to make entry and found Latamondeer hiding inside the home. He was taken to the Mississippi County Jail. Sheriff Moore said Sikeston police assisted in the arrest. On Friday, at 1:52 a.m., officers were sent to Missouri Delta Medical Center in Sikeston, Mo. to assist another agency in reference to a domestic assault. Further investigation revealed that the domestic assault began at Walmart in Sikeston. The victim said she was assaulted by her boyfriend of one month, who was identified as Joseph Phillip Latamondeer. On Wednesday, September 14, the victim said it started at Walmart in Sikeston when Latamondeer punched her in the face in the parking lot before going inside for a few items.  Afterwards, they then drove to Hardee's to get some food. While in the drive-thru she said she tried to run away because she was afraid. The victim said she went up to Hardee's and attempted to go inside but the doors were locked. There were two other vehicles in the drive-thru, so she went to the first vehicle and they told her to leave. The second vehicle allowed her to talk and climb in the back seat. As she climbed inside, Latamondeer allegedly drug her out of the vehicle by her hair and arms and threw her into his vehicle. The victim said they then drove out of Sikeston city limits and to County Road 820 in New Madrid County where his truck broke down from overheating. She said she then tried to run again but he caught her. She stated he started kicking her several times in the sides and then threw her back into the truck and drove to Mississippi County to a place called 'Rock Bottoms.' The victim said they then got on an ATV, where Latamondeer started attacking her again. After the assault, he then drove her home. The victim said that this was not the first time he assaulted her, but she could not recall exact dates or times. The officer delivering the probable cause statement said the following about the injuries: "It is clear based on his actions in the past and this new charge that he is going to continue to commit violent acts towards women without any disregard for what he is doing or the amount of pain he inflicts. Based on my 25+ year working in law enforcement this was by far the most bruising I have ever seen on a victim as a result of being assaulted." The probable cause statements indicated the victim had burns on her back and chest that looked to be from a cigarette, according to medical personnel at Missouri Delta Medical Center. The report states she also had bruising on her face, chin and neck, on her left arm, covering the entire arm above the elbow, bruising all over her back, on her buttocks, bruising on her upper left leg and knee covering almost the entire thigh, three large bruises on her right upper thigh and knee, multiple bruises on her chest and stomach area. The victim also had approximately 16 bite marks on her back, chest, arms and legs. She had 8 broken ribs, broken in multiple places. She was in kidney failure as a result of the assault, requiring dialysis, and also has a bruised heart sustained from the domestic assault, according to investigators. The victim's mother says her daughter's friend called her because she could not get inside the victim's home in East Prairie, but could hear her crying. Her mother then went inside to find her daughter crying on the edge of her bed, saying that her whole body hurt. Her mother said she could see the bruising on her face, neck, and arms. The victim recounted the events of the night, saying she was afraid to go to the hospital. The victim's father said he received a phone call from the victim's mother saying their daughter had been hurt. He arrived at the home and learned that Latamondeer had allegedly beaten her, apparently because she told him she planned on leaving the state. Latamondeer has several prior felony convictions. He now faces charges of domestic assault, first degree - serious physical injury, kidnapping, and armed criminal action. Download the KFVS News app: iPhone | Android Copyright 2016 KFVS.

Published Sep 19th, 2016 4:55 pm ksouza@talkbusiness.net / @tbarkansas K-Mart store closures in Springdale, Jonesboro and 58 other sites across the country are not a surprise to retail analysts, consumers and employees who have seen the once iconic retail brand fade thanks to the rise of Wal-Mart, Target and other retailers. About two dozen, curious bargain-hunting shoppers roamed the thinly stocked aisles at the Springdale Big K Discount Center on Monday (Sept. 19). Store officials said the last of day of business for the two Arkansas locations will be Dec. 11 and clearance sales begin Sept. 22. Howard Riefs, corporate spokesman for K-Mart, told Talk Business & Politics that making the difficult, said it was a tough but necessary decision to close the stores at 2010 S. Caraway Road in Jonesboro and 3142 W. Sunset Ave. in Springdale. “It’s important for you to know that until then, the stores will remain open for customers until mid-December. … We have been strategically and aggressively evaluating our store space and productivity, and are accelerating the closing of unprofitable stores as we have previously announced,” he said. Earlier this summer the retailer closed 74 K-Mart stores and roughly 60 Sears locations. This round of closures involves 64 stores across 28 states, including Arkansas. Riefs declined to say how many workers in the two Arkansas stores would be displaced. He said displaced workers such as salaried managers will be eligible for severance and have the opportunity to apply for open positions at Sears stores in their area. He said most of the workers are part-time, hourly and do not qualify for severance packages. Riefs said K-Mart Shop Your Way Members will continue to be able to shop online for merchandise after the store closures are completed. The retailer hopes to retain a portion of the sales associated with the closing stores. “We are always disappointed to see a business close its doors and displace workers, but these decisions like this are not made locally. The strong economy here today is a positive for those displaced workers who have a high chance to land another job quickly and that is my sincere hope,” said Springdale Mayor Doug Sprouse. Shoppers in the Springdale store on Monday said they weren’t surprised to see the store close because many people forget the store is there because there is so little marketing and the location while on a main thoroughfare does not face the street and is partially hidden by a Bank of America branch which does face the street. Talk Business & Politics price checked items at the K-Mart store and found prices for household cleaner, dog food, shampoo and other consumables were at least 10% higher than at nearby Walmart and Dollar General stores. The store did offer two “Blue Light Specials” during a 40-minute period around noon on Monday. A few customers lined up to purchase dog treats and pet items priced at $5 during the special were marked down to $1. The same was done for some clearance household cleaning items as well. There were six registers at the front of the Springdale store and just one checker open at mid-day on Monday. Standing in line, J.W. Turner said he lives in the neighborhood and heard the store was closing but it came as no surprise to him. “It’s convenient for us, but there really aren’t any bargains here and the service is spotty,” he said. A sign in the K-Mart store in Springdale addresses the layaway policy for the closing store. Store officials in the Jonesboro store declined comment on the pending closure except to say the doors will close for good once the clearance sale is complete. ‘LACK OF ATTENTION’ TO BRAND “K-Mart has struggled to find a brand identity but one could argue that it hasn’t tried that hard to do so, “ said Carol Spieckerman, CEO of Spieckerman Retail. “Considering the proactive and aggressive moves that its competitors are making, K-Mart can’t sit idly by and hope for the best, yet that seems to be the approach up to this point.” Spieckerman said since hedge fund manager Eddie Lampert took over Sears and K-Mart, Walmart, Target and dollar retailers have really upped their games – yet K-Mart still sits as an undifferentiated big box. To be fair, she said the number of store closings K-Mart announced represents a small percentage, but there are no indications the remaining stores will gain strength. K-Mart began the year with 870 stores and soon will be under 800 for the U.S. market. Ten years ago, KMart had 1,416 stores. Sears, its parent company, has suffered a similar downsizing with about 730 stores operating from the 2,427 a decade ago. “It was clear when Lampert took over Sears and K-Mart that he wasn’t a traditional ‘merchant prince’ and initially, that looked to be a good things. In fact, many of the early innovations that he introduced, including click-and-collect, making Sears’ private brands available to other retailers and operating a stand-alone innovation lab, were quite forward-thinking at the time and have since been adopted by other retailers. At the end of the day, though, the lack of attention to brand identity and differentiated store environments and shopping experience have been hard to overcome,” Spieckerman said. FINANCIAL TAILSPIN Just last week Moody’s analysts speculated that Sears and K-mart don’t have enough money – or access to money – to stay in business. In a note published Sept. 14, Moody’s’ downgraded Sears’ liquidity rating, noting the “retailer is bleeding cash” and will have to continue to rely on outside funding or the sale of assets, such as real estate, to sustain operations. “We recognize the risks associated with relying on these sources and continued shareholder support to finance its negative operating cash flow which is estimated by Moody’s to be approximately $1.5 billion this year,” the analysts wrote. “The ratings …reflect our view on the uncertainty of the viability of the Kmart franchise in particular given its meaningful market share erosion.” Sears reported in August its cash had fallen to $276 million from $1.8 billion a year ago. The reason cited for the drastic cash burn is plunging sales at K-Mart and Sears. The company reported net sales of $5.7 billion in the second quarter, a decline of 8.8% from a year ago. Same-store sales were down 3.3% at K-Mart and 7% lower at Sears. Since K-Mart merged with Sears in 2005, the discount retailer has seen its sales drop by $27 billion. Moody’s said K-Mart’s parent Sears has debts of $3.5 billion and an unfunded pension and post-retirement obligation of $2.1 billion, placng the company in need of cash if it’s to fund 2016 and 2017 minimum pension contributions. Neil Stern, partner at retail consultant at McMillanDoolittle, recently said it looks as if the retailer’s days are numbered. He was quoted by Fortune recently on the demise of K-Mart and Sears. “It’s incredibly hard to run a retail company when every quarter you get less sales and less customers coming through the door,” Stern said. “You can only cut costs for so long and sell assets.” COMPETITIVE LOSS “Sam Walton taught us to be on guard because everyone is competition. For too long K-Mart management has been asleep at the wheel,” said Peggy Knight retail consultant at Vendor Masters and former executive for Walmart and Sam’s Club. “During my tenure at Walmart and Sam’s Club we viewed K-Mart as a competitor but as the years rolled on it became clear that K-Mart management was too focused on profits and losses and not nearly as focused on customer service and taking care of their employees,” Knight told Talk Business & Politics. A short time after Knight left Walmart she was recruited by K-Mart but said she was not interested in working for a company with so little focus on its people. Knight said it’s been about 10 years since she was in a K-Mart store. She said the brand lapsed from the consciousness of most consumers and the retailer hasn’t done anything to stop it. “When I went to work for Walmart in 1983, K-Mart was the No. 1 retailer in the U.S., but without a team of leaders working around a common goals that reign was doomed to fail for K-Mart. At Walmart we were not allowed to make excuses for the weather or the election,” Knight recalled. Knight also predicts K-Mart’s days are numbered because she thinks they gave up years ago when the retailer couldn’t execute and properly market something like the Blue Light Special for which it had once been known. “When I heard they were bringing this back, I thought maybe the retailer realizes the importance of retailtainment and I expected to see them market the return to basics. But they do no marketing of their brand to speak of and consumers today don’t know who they are, or they have largely forgotten,” Knight said.

Business Highlights Business by The Associated Press Posted Sep 19, 2016 3:48 pm MST Last Updated Sep 19, 2016 at 4:40 pm MST ___ With economic outlook hazy, Fed likely to leave rates alone WASHINGTON (AP) — The Federal Reserve has repeatedly signalled that it’s edging closer to resuming interest rate hikes — it just doesn’t seem to be there quite yet. When the Fed ends its latest policy meeting Wednesday, it’s expected to leave the short-term rate it controls at the low level where it’s been for 10 months. In the view of most economists, the Fed wants more time to assess the health of the U.S. economy, the risks from overseas and the prospect that low inflation will soon reach the central bank’s 2 per cent target rate. Many think the next rate increase will come in December. ___ Banks focus more on new accounts — and the fees they bring NEW YORK (AP) — When Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf testifies before a Senate committee hearing Tuesday, it won’t be just his bank under fire, it’ll be the entire industry. Wells Fargo is in the spotlight after its employees allegedly opened up to 2 million bank and credit card accounts, transferred customers’ money without telling them and more to meet lofty sales goals. But cross-selling, as it is called, is the lifeblood of the entire retail banking industry. Other banks don’t face the same allegations of fraud, but experts say the industry as a whole engages in high-pressure sales tactics. ___ US stocks can’t hang onto gains, finish lower NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks wobbled and finished mostly lower Monday as investors waited for central bank meetings in the United States and Japan. Health care and technology companies took some of the biggest losses while banks rose. Investors were indecisive as leaders of the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan prepared to meet, and stocks swung several times between gains and losses. Banks, utility companies and machinery makers rose. Bond yields edged higher and the dollar weakened. ___ With some gas stations dry, pipeline works to send more fuel ATLANTA (AP) — Gas prices spiked and drivers found “out of service” bags covering pumps as the gas shortage in the South rolled into the work week, raising fears that the scattered disruptions could become more widespread. The shortage is blamed on a pipeline rupture and leak of at least 252,000 gallons of gas in Alabama. The pipeline company has two main lines and said Monday that it is shipping “significant volumes” on the second of the two lines to mitigate the impact of the interruption on the other line. ___ Samsung says it has found no battery problem in China SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Samsung Electronics said Monday that its investigation into the first report of a Galaxy Note 7 fire in China found no battery problem, reducing concerns that its smartphone crisis had expanded. The tech giant said it was not able to investigate a second reported fire because it could not obtain that phone. The two accounts of Galaxy Note 7 fires were widely reported by Chinese and South Korean media, raising alarms because company had already said a recall wasn’t necessary in China because the phones sold there did not have the manufacturing error that caused fires elsewhere. ___ Carnival Corp. launching 3 TV shows about vacations, travel NEW YORK (AP) — Carnival Corp. is launching three TV programs about travel, vacations and cruising that will air on ABC, NBC and The CW networks beginning Oct. 1. Each show will have its own real-life narrative exploring seaside destinations, in-port adventures or the vacation experiences of real travellers. Carnival Corp. owns more than 100 ships across 10 different cruise line brands, including Holland America, Princess, Fathom and Cunard in addition to Carnival Cruise Line. The shows will feature ships from all of Carnival Corp.’s cruise brands over the course of various episodes. ___ Australia’s busiest container port leased for $7.3 billion SYDNEY (AP) — An Australian-led consortium has won a 50-year lease on the country’s busiest container port for 9.7 billion Australian dollars ($7.3 billion), officials announced Monday. The Lonsdale consortium, which includes multinational firm Global Infrastructure Partners LLC and Australia’s sovereign wealth fund, among others, secured the lease for the Port of Melbourne in a deal expected to create thousands of jobs and boost investment in local infrastructure projects, Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said. The lease is the latest in a series of port privatizations in Australia in recent years. ___ Wal-Mart completes purchase of Jet.com NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart said Monday it has completed its purchase of online retailer Jet.com for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock, an acquisition aimed at helping the world’s largest retailer attract younger and more affluent customers to drive online sales. The hefty price tag shows how heavily Wal-Mart is willing to invest as it tries to increase online sales. Wal-Mart has said it will incorporate some of Jet.com’s “smart technology” that lowers prices in real times by looking for ways to cut costs. However, Wal-Mart and Jet.com will operate as separate brands. ___ FDA Oks 1st muscular dystrophy drug; awaits proof it works WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal regulators on Monday granted tentative approval to the first drug for a rare form of muscular dystrophy. The approval comes nearly five months after the Food and Drug Administration and a panel of outside advisers panned the drug, saying there was little evidence that it helped. But regulators faced a public backlash from patients’ families, politicians and physicians who pushed for the largely unproven medication. Sarepta Therapeutics’ Exondys 51 aims to treat a rare form of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a deadly inherited disease that causes muscle weakness, loss of movement and eventually death. ___ Kohl’s to hire 69,000 seasonal workers NEW YORK (AP) — Kohl’s plans to hire more than 69,000 additional workers for the upcoming holiday season to meet demand at more than 1,100 stores nationwide. The departments store operator said it started hiring in August for the holiday season and expects most jobs to be filled by the middle of November. Several other retailers and businesses have already started ramping up hiring for the key holiday shopping season. ___ Kellogg recalls some Eggo waffles NEW YORK (AP) — Kellogg Co. is recalling about 10,000 cases of its Eggo Nutri-Grain Whole Wheat Waffles in 25 states because they could be contaminated with the bacteria listeria. Listeria can cause serious and even deadly infections. It primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weak immune systems. The Battle Creek, Michigan company said Monday it has received no reports of illnesses. Kellogg says it learned of the potential problem after routine tests. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average shed 3.63 points, or less than 0.1 per cent, to 18,120.17. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gave up 0.04 points to 2,139.12. The Nasdaq composite dipped 9.54 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 5,235.03. Benchmark U.S. crude added 27 cents to $43.30 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 18 cents to $45.95 a barrel in London. In other energy trading, wholesale gasoline lost 4 cents, or 2.8 per cent, to $1.42 a gallon. Heating oil fell 1 cent to $1.39 a gallon. Natural gas retreated 1 cent to $2.93 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Police say that a female suspect, captured on surveillance footage, allegedly went to Wal-Mart in North Myrtle Beach and, using previously discarded receipts, proceeded to fraudulently return items from the store’s shelves to customer service for cash. The woman reportedly did this on Aug. 20 and Sept. 5, according to a release from the city of North Myrtle Beach. Surveillance footage from Sept. 5 showed the woman wearing what appeared to be a brace on her right wrist.

The Lonsdale consortium, which includes multinational firm Global Infrastructure Partners LLC and Australia's sovereign wealth fund, among others, secured the lease for the Port of Melbourne in a deal expected to create thousands of jobs and boost investment in local infrastructure projects, Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said.

The hefty price tag shows how heavily Wal-Mart is willing to invest as it tries to increase online sales. Wal-Mart has said it will incorporate some of Jet.com's "smart technology" that lowers prices in real times by looking for ways to cut costs. However, Wal-Mart and Jet.com will operate as separate brands. ___ FDA Oks 1st muscular dystrophy drug; awaits proof it works WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal regulators on Monday granted tentative approval to the first drug for a rare form of muscular dystrophy. The approval comes nearly five months after the Food and Drug Administration and a panel of outside advisers panned the drug, saying there was little evidence that it helped. But regulators faced a public backlash from patients' families, politicians and physicians who pushed for the largely unproven medication. Sarepta Therapeutics' Exondys 51 aims to treat a rare form of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a deadly inherited disease that causes muscle weakness, loss of movement and eventually death. ___ Kohl's to hire 69,000 seasonal workers NEW YORK (AP) — Kohl's plans to hire more than 69,000 additional workers for the upcoming holiday season to meet demand at more than 1,100 stores nationwide.

Several other retailers and businesses have already started ramping up hiring for the key holiday shopping season. ___ Kellogg recalls some Eggo waffles NEW YORK (AP) — Kellogg Co. is recalling about 10,000 cases of its Eggo Nutri-Grain Whole Wheat Waffles in 25 states because they could be contaminated with the bacteria listeria. Listeria can cause serious and even deadly infections. It primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weak immune systems. The Battle Creek, Michigan company said Monday it has received no reports of illnesses. Kellogg says it learned of the potential problem after routine tests. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average shed 3.63 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 18,120.17. The Standard & Poor's 500 index gave up 0.04 points to 2,139.12. The Nasdaq composite dipped 9.54 points, or 0.2 percent, to 5,235.03. Benchmark U.S. crude added 27 cents to $43.30 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 18 cents to $45.95 a barrel in London.

When the Fed ends its latest policy meeting Wednesday, it’s expected to leave the short-term rate it controls at the low level where it’s been for 10 months. In the view of most economists, the Fed wants more time to assess the health of the U.S. economy, the risks from overseas and the prospect that low inflation will soon reach the central bank’s 2 per cent target rate. Many think the next rate increase will come in December. ___ Banks focus more on new accounts — and the fees they bring NEW YORK (AP) — When Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf testifies before a Senate committee hearing Tuesday, it won’t be just his bank under fire, it’ll be the entire industry. Wells Fargo is in the spotlight after its employees allegedly opened up to 2 million bank and credit card accounts, transferred customers’ money without telling them and more to meet lofty sales goals. But cross-selling, as it is called, is the lifeblood of the entire retail banking industry. Other banks don’t face the same allegations of fraud, but experts say the industry as a whole engages in high-pressure sales tactics. ___ US stocks can’t hang onto gains, finish lower NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks wobbled and finished mostly lower Monday as investors waited for central bank meetings in the United States and Japan. Health care and technology companies took some of the biggest losses while banks rose. Investors were indecisive as leaders of the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan prepared to meet, and stocks swung several times between gains and losses. Banks, utility companies and machinery makers rose. Bond yields edged higher and the dollar weakened. ___ With some gas stations dry, pipeline works to send more fuel ATLANTA (AP) — Gas prices spiked and drivers found “out of service” bags covering pumps as the gas shortage in the South rolled into the work week, raising fears that the scattered disruptions could become more widespread. The shortage is blamed on a pipeline rupture and leak of at least 252,000 gallons of gas in Alabama. The pipeline company has two main lines and said Monday that it is shipping “significant volumes” on the second of the two lines to mitigate the impact of the interruption on the other line. ___ Samsung says it has found no battery problem in China SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — Samsung Electronics said Monday that its investigation into the first report of a Galaxy Note 7 fire in China found no battery problem, reducing concerns that its smartphone crisis had expanded. The tech giant said it was not able to investigate a second reported fire because it could not obtain that phone. The two accounts of Galaxy Note 7 fires were widely reported by Chinese and South Korean media, raising alarms because company had already said a recall wasn’t necessary in China because the phones sold there did not have the manufacturing error that caused fires elsewhere. ___ Carnival Corp. launching 3 TV shows about vacations, travel NEW YORK (AP) — Carnival Corp. is launching three TV programs about travel, vacations and cruising that will air on ABC, NBC and The CW networks beginning Oct. 1.

Carnival Corp. owns more than 100 ships across 10 different cruise line brands, including Holland America, Princess, Fathom and Cunard in addition to Carnival Cruise Line. The shows will feature ships from all of Carnival Corp.’s cruise brands over the course of various episodes. ___ Australia’s busiest container port leased for $7.3 billion SYDNEY (AP) — An Australian-led consortium has won a 50-year lease on the country’s busiest container port for 9.7 billion Australian dollars ($7.3 billion), officials announced Monday. The Lonsdale consortium, which includes multinational firm Global Infrastructure Partners LLC and Australia’s sovereign wealth fund, among others, secured the lease for the Port of Melbourne in a deal expected to create thousands of jobs and boost investment in local infrastructure projects, Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said. The lease is the latest in a series of port privatizations in Australia in recent years. ___ Wal-Mart completes purchase of Jet.com NEW YORK (AP) — Wal-Mart said Monday it has completed its purchase of online retailer Jet.com for $3 billion in cash plus $300 million in stock, an acquisition aimed at helping the world’s largest retailer attract younger and more affluent customers to drive online sales. The hefty price tag shows how heavily Wal-Mart is willing to invest as it tries to increase online sales. Wal-Mart has said it will incorporate some of Jet.com’s “smart technology” that lowers prices in real times by looking for ways to cut costs. However, Wal-Mart and Jet.com will operate as separate brands. ___ FDA Oks 1st muscular dystrophy drug; awaits proof it works WASHINGTON (AP) — Federal regulators on Monday granted tentative approval to the first drug for a rare form of muscular dystrophy. The approval comes nearly five months after the Food and Drug Administration and a panel of outside advisers panned the drug, saying there was little evidence that it helped. But regulators faced a public backlash from patients’ families, politicians and physicians who pushed for the largely unproven medication. Sarepta Therapeutics’ Exondys 51 aims to treat a rare form of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a deadly inherited disease that causes muscle weakness, loss of movement and eventually death. ___ Kohl’s to hire 69,000 seasonal workers NEW YORK (AP) — Kohl’s plans to hire more than 69,000 additional workers for the upcoming holiday season to meet demand at more than 1,100 stores nationwide. The departments store operator said it started hiring in August for the holiday season and expects most jobs to be filled by the middle of November. Several other retailers and businesses have already started ramping up hiring for the key holiday shopping season. ___ Kellogg recalls some Eggo waffles NEW YORK (AP) — Kellogg Co. is recalling about 10,000 cases of its Eggo Nutri-Grain Whole Wheat Waffles in 25 states because they could be contaminated with the bacteria listeria. Listeria can cause serious and even deadly infections. It primarily affects the elderly, pregnant women, newborns and people with weak immune systems. The Battle Creek, Michigan company said Monday it has received no reports of illnesses. Kellogg says it learned of the potential problem after routine tests. ___ The Dow Jones industrial average shed 3.63 points, or less than 0.1 per cent, to 18,120.17. The Standard & Poor’s 500 index gave up 0.04 points to 2,139.12. The Nasdaq composite dipped 9.54 points, or 0.2 per cent, to 5,235.03. Benchmark U.S. crude added 27 cents to $43.30 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, rose 18 cents to $45.95 a barrel in London.

It creates moments that people will remember forever. For example, Shawn Michaels and Razor Ramon at WrestleMania 10 is considered one of the best matches in WWE history. It was for the Intercontinental championship the same night Bret Hart fought Yokozuna for the WWE title. That night was memorable for many reasons, but professional wrestling is about more than one night. Remember CM Punk’s WWE championship victory over John Cena at Money in the Bank 2011 in Chicago, Illinois? That was a moment that arguably created the legacy Punk cemented that evening in Chicago against the Face that Runs the Place. Another great moment was Dolph Ziggler’s Money in the Bank briefcase cash-in after WrestleMania 29 in New York. He was a huge fan favorite, and it culminated in one of the best babyface pops in WWE history. [Image by WWE.com] Another thing pro wrestling is good for lies in the controversies that often arise from the squared circle and the many superstars. Whether it is nude pictures, controversial statements or hatred towards one another, it seems that wrestling always finds itself in the headlines for a negative reason. Buff Bagwell is the latest example of that. He’s a former wrestling star turned entertainment star who was in the wrestling industry for a long time. So, his opinion is quite valid compared to others in the Internet Wrestling Community. Bagwell decided to direct comments towards CM Punk, who isn’t the most well-liked anymore, and he got brutally beaten in his UFC debut against Mickey Gall at UFC 203. Bagwell used that popularity towards Punk’s name to criticize him and Samoa Joe on the Pancakes and Powerslams podcast. “Here’s how I look at it. If I was a promoter like Vince McMahon or Ted Turner, if I was trying to make money in the wrestling industry, I would judge it by having a person walk through Walmart,” he said. “If CM Punk walked through Walmart even as popular as he is, he’s not going to get noticed as much as Hulk Hogan walking through Walmart The reason why I say Walmart, is that’s our fan base.” “To the world of wrestling fans, who’s going to be Sting’s tag team partner? The options are Lex Luger, Marcus Bagwell, and Samoa Joe. I mean, who in the heck is Samoa Joe? And Luger wasn’t fit enough, so I fit the part perfectly,” Bagwell said. The problem that WWE fans can’t handle is that Bagwell is absolutely right. It’s mostly due to professional wrestling not being nearly as marketable as it once was. There’s a reason why John Cena, Hulk Hogan, and the Rock are three of the most over men of all-time. They are also big in the mainstream media. Hogan is a pop culture icon. The Rock is the highest paid actor in all of Hollywood, earning $64.5 million for his film roles in 2015. [Image by WWE.com] Cena is doing a television show a week it seems. Stone Cold Steve Austin is also in that conversation and has done multiple movies. He’s considered the most over man in wrestling history. Wrestling isn’t quite as popular with the declining ratings and low buy rates for PPV’s. Everything is changing, which Bagwell indirectly alluded to. CM Punk really doesn’t miss pro wrestling, and why should he? Ratings are terrible and with the return of Monday Night Football, it’s only going to get worse. For Punk, his quest to return to the UFC will take a long time, and it will only enhance his popularity to pass the Walmart test. His coach said multiple MMA promotions would love Punk to be in his or her promotion. Perhaps if he passes the Walmart test, he would return to the UFC and become a household name.

Elise Bryant was convicted of felony child abuse in a Mississippi court, but managed to negotiate a plea deal with prosecutors. In the terms of the agreement, the state recommended a sentence of 10 years for the 26-year-old, with an eight-year suspension and two years served under house arrest. She will also be closely watched for three years and has been instructed to pay a fine of $1,000 to a children’s fund and $1,500 to the court. On the night of August 21, 2014, police officers had responded to a domestic disturbance call at an apartment complex in Gulfport, Mississippi, where the little boy lived with the biological father and stepmother, Elise Bryant. Neighbors were the ones who called the police around 10:30 a.m. to report the assault on the child. When police officers arrived on the scene, they found Bryant, who was 24-years-old at the time, kneeling over the one-year-old child and punching him repeatedly in the face. Police said the boy’s legs were bound together and that he had a swollen head and bruised arms. His stepmother was arrested and he was taken to a hospital where he was treated for his injuries. Assistant District Attorney Crosby Parker, who described the incident as a “very troubling case,” revealed that the plea deal was worked out in agreement between the defense and the prosecution, but ultimately approved by the presiding judge, Roger Clark. Baltimore police officer enters an Alford Plea – What is an Alford Plea? http://t.co/ip2hWTrMF9 pic.twitter.com/ol4Gnx2r00 — Jeffrey S. Crockett (@Crockett_Law) October 13, 2015 Prosecutors had allowed Elsie Bryant to file a so-called “Alford plea,” which allows defendants to plead guilty and at the same time still maintain that they are innocent. This means that Bryant did not confess to her crimes, but rather admitted that the state prosecution had enough evidence to convict her. Elsie Bryant’s defense attorney had pushed forward a theory that the child got his injuries from an accident and not at the hands of his stepmother. Parker said even though the prosecution’s case was not strengthened because of a lack of witnesses and medical evidence to show how the child got his injuries, all fingers still pointed to Elise Bryant as the one responsible. “The defense had retained an expert to put forth testimony that the boy’s injuries were consistent with an accident. However, the state expected to put forth evidence that the child had Wal-Mart bags tied around his ankles and a mark on the head and lip when officers arrived.” The Assistant District Attorney went on further to make his point. “The tying of the legs was obviously very disturbing, but what makes the case a felony is the mark to the head and actual injuries. Fortunately, the child was released that day with a diagnosis on the head and a superficial lip laceration.” This is not the first time that a parent would be using the Alford plea to strike a deal with prosecutors. Stephanie Ramirez was sentenced to 20 years in prison despite triggering the plea for first-degree child abuse which caused the death of her 21-month-old daughter. Her husband had beaten the girl badly, fracturing her ribs and cracking her skull. Prosecutors say Williams returned from work and refused to seek medical assistance for her daughter because her husband said it would get Child Protective Services involved. The child died of internal injuries. Doctor said the young girl’s life could have been saved if emergency surgery had been carried out quickly to repair her damaged organs. Paul Thomas, father of a five-year-old boy also triggered the Alford plea and was sentenced to 15 months in prison for felony child abuse and neglect. He was looking at a maximum sentence of 10 years for leaving his children alone at home as he went out with his girlfriend. The boy was declared missing and found in a septic tank four days later. Alexis Raiford, in her own case, was held accountable for the death of her three-year-old son, Zyon Thompson. Prosecutors say that the woman did not kill her son, but did nothing to stop her husband and another man from beating him up frequently. Prosecutors say the boy was denied medical treatment and fell seriously ill before he later died. A child abuse expert revealed that if he had been taken to a hospital, he would have survived. Doctors say he was covered from “head to toe” in bruises and despite claims by his mother that he got injured playing, said his injuries were “not consistent with the day-to-day activities of a 3-year-old.” [Featured Image by Dennis Stern/Shutterstock] Now Watch This: Burglars Break Into Home While Owners Asleep On Couch Now Read This: Maryland Teen Beaten Up During Donald Trump Student Protest Share 1 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Author Tito Ojo-Medubi Tags: child abuse, child death, crime against children Comments LATEST HEADLINES Angelina Jolie’s Secret Life Exposed!

I now would like you to help me get a framed article by Paul Harvey to every police person nationwide — starting in Pottsville. Recently, I heard Paul Harvey’s now-famous radio broadcast of “What Are Policeman Made Of.” It brought tears to my eyes, and I immediately thought every policeman should have a free copy to help boost morale in these troubling times. You can hear it by going to Paul Harvey on Google. Staples and Wal-Mart helped me with the Glenn Miller concert and trips to Washington for the WWII veterans, and I asked them for help again. They agreed, and Staples is supplying the certificates and the printing and Wal-Mart is giving me a discount on the frames. My hope is to have a picture of a chief or other representative receiving the framed certificates for their officers from Staples and Wal-Mart managers who helped supply the materials needed. I could use this photo to help the corporations decide to supply the help nationally so I would not need a fundraising group in every state. Please call me at 570-573-0242 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. if you are interested in receiving a certificate for yourself or department. Hopefully, this letter will help me reach some of the smaller police departments in your coverage area that are not responding to my calls. George E.

We're told all businesses in the same shopping center as WalMart have been affected. The affected businesses will be without water for the next 5-7 hours.  Officials say no other businesses outside of this shopping center have reported a water loss.  Some residents may have experienced some discoloration in their water along the Highway 463/Main Street corridor.  No loss of pressure occurred in the system to the City’s knowledge. No boil water alert has not been issued at this time. Copyright 2016 MSNewsNow. All rights reserved.

She is identified as Tisa Lynn McCann, 44. There were no signs she was slain, sheriff's spokesman Lt. Eric Flowers said. Investigators are waiting on tests to see if anything she ingested contributed to her death, he said. Her remains were found Sept. 10 when a delivery truck driver noticed an odd smell behind the Wal-Mart, west of the county’s busiest intersection: State Road 60 and 58th Avenue. The driver found the body in a wooded area near Wal-Mart and an Applebee’s restaurant. No further information was available on Sunday.

And because he is a convicted felon, 35-year-old Courtney Johnson is now facing a federal charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm. According to an affidavit filed Monday in federal court, the incident occurred early Saturday outside a Wal-Mart in the 8500 block of North Boardwalk Avenue when officers spotted a truck with a stolen license tag. Police were talking to Johnson about the truck when one officer noticed a large knife in his pocket. When Johnson reached into the pocket, the officer grabbed his wrist, according to the documents. An officer then handcuffed Johnson behind his back. Johnson allegedly pulled out a gun and pointed it an officer before he was tackled and disarmed. The weapon, a .45-caliber semi-automatic handgun, was loaded with seven rounds, including one in the chamber, according to the documents. Johnson has a prior felony conviction for attempted robbery, according to court records and cannot legally possess a firearm.

Exclusive: Mychal Massie figures complainers would be in jail if not for on-field skills Published: 09/19/2016 at 7:24 PM Mychal Massie About | Email | Archive Mychal Massie is founder and chairman of the Racial Policy Center (http://racialpolicycenter.org), a conservative think tank that advocates for a colorblind society. He was recognized as the 2008 Conservative Man of the Year by the Conservative Party of Suffolk County, New York. He is a nationally recognized political activist, pundit and columnist. Massie has appeared on cable news and talk-radio programming worldwide. He is also the founder and publisher of The Daily Rant: mychal-massie.com. Follow Subscribe to feed Share on Facebook Share on Twitter ShareEmail  Print I watched a black professional football player wax passionately in his complaint that it isn’t as bad today as when his “mamma” was born in 1955, but blacks today are still fighting for equality. The ESPN program hosts solemnly nodded their heads in agreement. The depth of ignorance the petulant multi-millionaire athlete displayed was stunning. Which brings me to my point. Just what “equality” is it these blacks are claiming blacks do not have? Do they understand the definition of “equality,” or are they arguing for preferential treatment simply because they are black? What these pluripotent complainers are apparently too uneducated to realize is that blacks have the exact same equality everyone else has. And if they bothered to put aside their jaundiced perspective of modernity, they would understand that. Equality dictates and defines the ability of all persons to purchase the home of their choice predicated upon their credit and ability to pay for same. Equality dictates and is defined as the ability of all persons to dine, shop, purchase and lodge wherever they choose based upon their ability to pay. Equality dictates and is defined in the context that people can seek employment where they wish and reasonably expect to be considered for hiring based upon their qualifications. Just what equality are blacks lacking today? I live in Orlando, Florida. The restaurants we dine at are host to countless numbers of blacks, many of whom are staying in expensive hotels on vacation. I see blacks dining and shopping in the most exclusive stores, as well as in Wal-Mart. Blacks enjoy luxurious time-share rentals just as many others do. For these spoiled multi-millionaire athletes to claim that blacks don’t have equality is a damnable heterodoxy spewed by pernicious calumniators. Even more contradictory to the boorish complaints is that many multi-millionaire athletes live in the same area I do. It is an undeniable fact that blacks have the same rights and opportunities everyone else enjoys. It is the choice of what to do with said rights and opportunities that needs to be addressed. If blacks did not have equality, they would not be ordering meals in Orlando restaurants, from Wendy’s to Christner’s Prime Steak and Lobster to Chatham’s Place with whites taking their orders and preparing their meals. If blacks did not have equality, they would not be renting and purchasing homes, from Baton Rouge to Wyoming to Anchorage, Alaska. If blacks didn’t enjoy equality they wouldn’t be serviced by white sales persons in every corner of America, from a Dollar Tree store to the haute couture stores in the finest shopping districts. Bad police have injured and/or mistreated Americans of every description not just blacks. The truth is that these complainers are motivated by a bigotry that looks back to a time past that America has had the good sense and decency to reject and overcome. It is an unconscionable act of intellectual dishonesty to persuade other blacks that the misfortune some of them suffer is always based upon their skin color. The Gordian knot that binds the minds of so many blacks is further tightened by these complaining and protesting athletes, many if not most of whom would be serving jail sentences if they did not excel at passing, running and shooting (baskets). The message blacks need to embrace is that life isn’t free and bad decisions lead to bad outcomes. They must understand that they can change the definition of propriety, but they cannot change the injurious outcomes from same. I am beyond weary with the complaining and accusations of inequality in America. I am equally tired of hearing we need a conversation on race. First of all there is no such thing as “race.” The idea of race is the construct of the social-Darwinists embraced by Hitler as justification for his attempted extermination of Jews and the myth of German superiority. What those calling for such dialogue are actually calling for is a conversation on skin color. To which I say, we do not need a conversation on skin color; we need a conversation on personal responsibility and propriety. Instead of resorting to perverse self-serving tautological arguments that are without merit, these athletes need to set examples by going to classes, graduating from schools based upon meeting standards of learning consistent with grade level, having a wife and family not “babies’ mammas,” staying away from drugs and aberrant behavior, by attending Christ-centered churches with their families and by representing personal responsibility juxtaposed to belligerence and bigotry. It’s about time these people understand that within the realities of life the chance of tragic misfortune hovers about us all. But with that said, what must be understood is that bad behavior and bad decisions lead to bad outcomes. And if people refuse to change their behavior, they cannot change the consequences resulting from same. Media wishing to interview Mychal Massie, please contact media@wnd.com.

At the moment gas stations around me are out of fuel. The few stations, such as Murphy's / Wal-Mart that have fuel have huge lines, and skyrocketing prices. Now I am wondering whether I should tune my car back to 87 Octane. At the moment I am tuned for 91 performance by Bama, and running 93 Octante. Of course I will change the tune if I am limited to 87 for a short while. My curiousity at the moment is whether or not fuel mileage would be better with 87 than with higher octane gas.   Remove Advertisements Sponsored Links Advertisement   09-19-2016, 05:13 PM   #2 Strange Mud Staff     Join Date: Aug 2013 Location: Small Town Region: Connecticut Posts: 4,097 I would re-tune for lower octane if you know you may be limited in what you can get. __________________ "every one of you was going 50"   Remove Advertisements Sponsored Links Advertisement   09-19-2016, 05:49 PM   #3 Revvv Registered Member     Join Date: Apr 2016 Location: Augusta Region: Georgia Posts: 1,802 http://m.chronicle.augusta.com/lates...tages-popping# It is definitely interesting.

Now, they hope to expand the program to the high schools. That could happen within six or eight weeks, if a sponsorship grant comes through. A national print and web publication, District Administration Magazine, is recognizing Erie's Public Schools and their partner Metz Culinary for serving free "breakfast in the classroom."  They piloted the idea in 2014 with just four schools. It worked so well, it expanded to a total of 13 elementary and middle schools last year. An initial 250-thousand-dollar grant from Walmart to Metz culinary, got things going. That helped with the staffing and equipment needed to take prepackaged "breakfast breaks" with cereals, grains and juices to each classroom, along with fresh milk and fruit.  They now deliver to 360 classrooms each day. The innovative idea is producing measurable results in curbing tardiness and behavior problems. Jenny Johns, Assistant General Manager at Metz said, "They've reported that there are less trips to the school nurse, less tardiness and just the general overall classroom seems to be just a good quiet start to the morning."  Johns said the feedback is positive from teachers and principals.  "It's a nice way to get the day started off," said Karin Ryan, Principal at Pfeiffer-Burleigh.  "Before, trying to get the kids in and out of the cafeteria sometimes caused a disruption in their day and this really provides that calming atmosphere for them to be able to come in and have breakfast." The breakfast food itself is federally funded through the school lunch program. The grant money to deliver breakfasts to classrooms, created about 25 jobs, and expanded hours for 60 other employees. Johns says if the high school program receives the needed grant money and and go ahead, the program may run a little differently.  Breakfast may be served at kiosks, where students could grab their breakfast and take it to class.

By Mitchell Hartman September 19, 2016 | 2:40 PM Listen to this story Download Embed Embed Code<iframe src="http://www.marketplace.org/2016/09/19/world/how-do-dollar-stores-buck-inflation/popout" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="240px"></iframe> Copy Close     - PAUL J. RICHARDS/AFP/Getty Images Marketplace listener Doray Sitko, of Austin, Texas, sent us this question: “How can the dollar store still be the dollar store? A lot of the products that I was purchasing for a dollar years ago, I’m still purchasing for a dollar today. And I wonder how they can maintain that dollar price-point—seemingly indifferent to inflation or cost of living?” First, some definitions. The “dollar-store” category consists of stores that sell a relatively limited range of items, at hyper-discount prices. Their prices are overall (though not necessarily for any specific individual item) lower than the mainstream discount chains, such as Walmart and Target. The two main national competitors in the dollar-store sector are both publicly traded: Dollar General, and Dollar Tree (which recently acquired Family Dollar stores). Dollar Tree prices all items in the store at $1 or less. Dollar General does not limit items for sale to those at or below $1. A spokesperson told us via email that the company prices more than 80 percent of items at $5 or less. And in general, retail experts agree that both chains have been very successful keeping most prices constant over the past decade or more. By contrast, consumer prices in the U.S. economy overall have been rising by about 1.7 percent per year since the mid-2000's, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index (CPI). So what cost $1 in 2006, will on average cost approximately $1.19 today. Image icons courtesy of thenounproject.org/Richard Wearn, Graphic by Sarah Menendez Dollar Tree did not respond to our query about how it keeps  every price in the store fixed at $1 in the face of inflation. Dollar General’s spokesperson emailed that it is “dedicated to the affordability needs” of its customers, but did not elaborate. Adheer Bahulkar is a partner in the retail practice of global strategy and consulting firm A.T. Kearney, and he said the dollar stores employ a multi-faceted strategy for maintaining relatively constant super-discounted prices in the face of inflation. He said there are three key components: merchandise selection (often generic or off-brand) and substitution, using robust data analytics to always lock in the lowest wholesale price available; extremely lean operations (for instance, minimal staffing in stores and corporate headquarters, low-rent store locations, etc.); and constant adjustments to the supply chain to take advantage of lower-priced overseas producers, as well as efficiencies in distribution, warehousing and logistics. Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia Business School, said the dollar stores turn the standard business relationship of goods-supplier to goods-retailer on its head. “This channel has the benefit of hard-wired price-points to be able to negotiate,” said Cohen. The chains use leverage as huge purchasers of a relatively narrow range of products (for example, just one or two brands of cola, rather than more than a dozen at a standard retail store), to dictate to suppliers the inventory purchase price. Sarah Menendez/Marketplace And why would supplier brands, such as Gatorade or Welches, play ball with this cut-throat pricing strategy that cuts into their bottom line? “They use different math than they would use for their more traditional retail customers,” said Cohen. He said that the ultra-low price suppliers  get from a dollar-chain may still pencil out to a narrow profit if  the companies are clearing out old inventory, or unloading goods that don’t pass muster for mainstream retail chains. “There’s always going to be excess supply, or distressed goods that somehow went bump in the night,” said Cohen. “If it’s cheap enough, these stores don’t care if the yellow is three shades off of what was originally ordered.” And economist Mark Kuperberg at Swarthmore College pointed out that the dollar stores sell plenty of items—for instance, clothing, consumer electronics and household goods—that have actually bucked the general price-inflation trend, and gotten cheaper over time, as production has shifted to lower-cost factories overseas. Finally, if all else fails, said Kuperberg, discounters can shave the quantity or quality of an item—just a bit—to keep the price on the package constant. “There’s the famous cases of when there were price controls,” said Kuperberg, “so a pack of cigarettes would have X price, but then people would make the cigarettes smaller. So there are ways in which you can maintain a price of a dollar but it’s actually not the same product any longer.” In the future, maintaining prices at $1 could get harder for the dollar stores, said Cohen, “if inflation were to become rampant—they might have to become two-dollar stores.” But he said bargain-loving consumers will still shop at a two-dollar store, before spending $2.50 at Target or Walmart.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 5:30 AM, September 20, 2016 Updated: 5:45 AM, September 20, 2016 Retailer Sears Holdings Corp <SHLD.O> will close a further 64 Kmart stores in the United States, a source familiar with the matter said, in addition to the nearly 70 it announced earlier this year. Sears, which has posted a quarterly profit just once in the last four years, said in April it would close 68 Kmart discount stores and 10 Sears department stores to cut costs. Once the largest U.S. retailer, Sears has lost its standing as customers move to online shopping or rivals such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc <WMT.N>. Sears had a total long term debt of $3.4 billion and cash balance of $276 million as of July 30, 2016. The company said later in May that it would explore options to expand its home-improvement service business and some of its best-known brands such as Kenmore appliances. Ratings agency Moody's investor service cut its rating on Sears' liquidity last week, saying Kmart's meaningful market share erosion has made it uncertain about its viability. Business Insider first reported the closures on Monday citing local news reports and Kmart employees. The additional stores earmarked for closure will begin liquidation sales on Sept. 22 and close by mid-December, the financial news website reported. Sears said it would provide an updated store count in their next quarterly filing.

Watkins K-Mart will close its Merrillville location on U.S. 30. editor's pick urgent Merrillville Kmart to close after 42 years Joseph S. Pete joseph.pete@nwi.com, (219) 933-3316 Joseph S Pete Sep 19, 2016 Buy Now John J. Watkins K-Mart will close its Merrillville location on U.S. 30. Kmart opened in Merrillville in 1974, a year after the company that now owns it finished building the largest office tower in the world on South Wacker Drive in downtown Chicago. Sears was then the largest retailer in the world, the Sears Tower was a testament to its prominence, and Kmart was riding high with its Blue Light Special sales. Thirty-one years later the two merged under the Sears Holding banner. Lately, both historic retailers have been declining amid increased competition from rivals like Wal-Mart and Target. They've closed hundreds of locations and laid off thousands of workers after failing to adapt to changing consumer preferences.  Kmart's ongoing contraction will now result in the closure of its Merrillville location at 101 Lincoln Hwy. A store employee said the big-box store was slated to close on Dec. 11. Business Insider reported 64 stores would close nationwide, but a company spokesman declined to comment. Kmart spokesman Howard Riefs did, however, confirm the Merrillville store would be shuttered. "We can confirm that we are making the difficult, but necessary decision to close the Kmart store at 101 W. Lincoln, Merrillville," Riefs said. "The store will close to the public in mid-December. It’s important for you to know that until then, the store will remain open for customers." Riefs declined to comment on how many employees would be laid off, but said they would get severance and have the chance to apply to open positions at other Sears or Kmart stores. Kmart still has locations in Griffith, Chesterton, Valparaiso and LaPorte, and Sears still has locations in Merrillville, Michigan City, Portage, Schererville and Valparaiso. Most of the affected workers were part-time or hourly. The Merrillville Kmart had been underperforming, Riefs said. "We have been strategically and aggressively evaluating our store space and productivity, and have accelerated the closing of unprofitable stores as previously announced," he said.  A liquidation sale will begin Thursday.

News Sports Entertainment Life Obituaries E-Edition Cars Jobs Homes Classifieds Member Rewards log in Site Archive Editorial: Addressing the future of Peoria Stadium the right way this time Monday Sep 19, 2016 at 4:34 PM Sep 19, 2016 at 4:42 PM As locals prepare to gather Tuesday night to brainstorm about the future of the Peoria Stadium property,  it may be clearer what most don't want for the 82 acres there than what they do. They emphatically do not desire a Walmart or any other big box store that would primarily benefit a private developer over the public that owns the property now. Neighbors covet the green space in an otherwise urban area that has largely been paved over. Notre Dame High School has expressed no interest in the property after being approached by intermediaries a few years back.  Beyond that, promising as the large but arguably underutilized property could be at this high-traffic location, it has its limitations, so the sky is not the limit. For one thing, the Peoria Public Schools own the property but do not wholly control it. Nearly 32 acres are leased by the Peoria Park District for ball fields and other recreational uses, with that agreement in force until 2030. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources provided grant money to spruce up the place a decade ago and so it has a say. The condition of the stadium itself — poor — communicates all you need to know about how much tax money and how much will to spend it at this location — with no shortage of other needs — there is on the School Board. Unique with its covered grandstand though the stadium is, previous school boards have by their substantial investments in athletic facilities at Peoria and Manual high schools pointed the district in another direction. Safe to say that Peoria Public Schools does not have the up to $3 million — from this vantage that may be low-ball — believed necessary to bring the stadium back to its former glory. Even if a sales tax referendum for schools were to pass in November, administrators have already expressed a preference for spending those revenues on air conditioning for classrooms. Demolition could be one of the options. As such some have spoken of a public-private partnership here, which would mean sharing the decision-making regarding a longtime public asset. We trust the private part of that equation would want to see a return on its money, which would suggest a commercial use. Meanwhile, it's a sizeable piece of land at a prominent location. As such, all of it does not have to be in play. A mixed use — hopefully compatible — could be discussed for part of the property. Beyond that, the infinitely more transparent approach here by a different school administration is a major improvement over the back-channel conversations that helped doom any decision on the property the last time. If you wish to have a say on this property's future, show up Tuesday at the stadium starting at 6 p.m. for a presentation and perhaps the beginnings of some public input. We'll be interested to hear what comes out of this.

Laura StamplerSep 19, 2016 4:21PM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog PinterestCourtesy of State Fair We have some fantastic news for both sweet and savory snack cravers: Cookie fries are officially a thing. That's right, The Dallas Morning News reports sightings of french fries made out of cookies. This is not a drill. And [according to Time, the delicious junk food that was once only available at the Texas State Fair will now be available year-round at a restaurant located inside a Walmart in Plano, Texas called State Fair Treats. Cookie fries are the brain child of the restaurant's owner and chef Isaac Rousso, and the treat unsurprisingly won the title of "Most Creative" at the Big Tex Choice Awards this year, according to the Morning News. Loading View on Instagram Loading View on Instagram Business Insider reports that State Fair Treats will also include nom-worthy foods like Fried Pop Tarts and Deep Fried Cuban Rolls. And if the new restaurant is a success, Time says that Walmart will consider opening up other locations in stores across the country.

He spent his entire teenage years addicted to drugs and didn’t care how he got his fix as long as he was able to get high. But it was a near deadly dose of drugs that changed his life forever. “I felt fearless. I wasn’t scared of nothing.” READ MORE: Fentanyl fact sheet – what it is and what it does Story continues below Related Fentanyl addiction behind a quarter of Calgary bank robberies: police At 19 years old, Anderson ingested what he thought was crystal meth. He knows now it was fentanyl–the drug responsible for killing 270 Albertans last year alone. Anderson overdosed in a basement suite and was left unnoticed for two nights. When his friend found him unconscious, he was rushed to hospital where he lay in a coma for nearly two weeks. He suffered two massive strokes while in the coma. READ MORE: Recovering fentanyl addict describes overdosing in Calgary Walmart Anderson was paralyzed from the neck down. The doctor broke the news that he was a quadriplegic. Trez lives full time in a long-term care facility. Jill Croteau “The doctor asked me if I wanted to live or die,” Anderson recalled. "I wanted to live and get through this and I did." Now 20, Anderson wants to do something positive. He wants to be a stark example for students, to show them what drugs can do.

He wants kids to understand the dramatic impacts. “If you look at me, I’m on a ventilator. How I live now is a lot different than before. You can’t eat on your own, can’t drink on your own, can’t do any sports — just sit here.” The brave young man has teamed up with two mothers who are already touring Calgary-area schools to speak to students about drugs. Trez shares time with Yvonne Clark and Sharon Schubert. Jill Croteau Both of their sons were friends and died from a drug overdose. Yvonne Clark lost her son, Conner, at 21 years old. He died after ingesting fentanyl. Conner Clark, 21. Yvonne Clark “I miss him horribly. He was my best friend,” Clark said through tears. “He was my first born. We were close.” Clark said Anderson’s story will resonate with the students. She remembered the first time she met the young man. “He’s an extraordinary young man.” As proud as she is of Anderson, she made a staggering admission: “It’s a hard thing for a mother to say – but I am blessed that I lost Conner and he didn’t end up how Trez did.” Sharon Schubert’s son, Christian, was close with Conner. Christian also died from an overdose. Christian Schubert, 20. Sharon Schubert “I never thought he’d die; I never thought it was that bad,” Sharon said. “Most parents don’t think that could ever happen to their child.” Both mothers hope their tragedies, along with Anderson’s reality, will save someone’s life. “It can either be a death sentence like Conner and Christian, or a life sentence,” Yvonne Clark said. “Trez is trapped in his body, imprisoned for life.” © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Published Wed, Nov 26, 2014  |  Floyd Brown, Political Expert Amazon (AMZN) started Black Friday deals early, but don’t count me in this year. I’ve been a customer of Amazon almost from the beginning, when all they delivered were books. I don’t know how many thousands of dollars of merchandise I’ve ordered over the years, but it’s likely in the tens of thousands. I adopted Amazon because it fit my busy lifestyle. Instead of having to visit Wal-Mart (WMT) and hustle from aisle to aisle… just to wait in a long line to pay for my merchandise… Amazon allowed me to buy with a few clicks and find the product at my doorstep just days later. But after making its worst business decision ever, I will forever boycott using the site. And I might not be alone… At first, Amazon’s premium service, Amazon Prime, improved on the customer experience. With no shipping and two-day delivery, there was no way to beat it. My Amazon purchases exploded. In fact, I was so addicted to Amazon last year that I spent most of Black Friday on the site completing my Christmas list. No need to fight the crowds at the mall. No need for rain checks. Heck, they even delivered my out-of-town gifts directly to the intended recipient. All of this joy is over now, however… Serious Lapse in Judgment If you’re a regular Amazon customer, you’ve likely noticed a change. Amazon dropped the United Parcel Service (UPS), and it increased shipping with the United States Postal Service (USPS). Amazon made a deal with the Devil, and the customers are now required to pay. Let me explain… When the deal was announced, the U.S. Postal Service thought it was the lifeline it needed to survive. Since bills and most correspondence now come via email – and checks are often delivered by Automated Clearing House (ACH) – the USPS has lost its reason to exist. Mail volume has plummeted and most of the mail delivered these days never makes it past the trash can into the house. They’re bleeding financially. Now, Amazon pays huge delivery fees, and it’s looking to build its own fleet of trucks and vehicles to deliver packages. Instead, it thought it had a match made in heaven: Take the excess capacity of the USPS, and make it the delivery system for Amazon. Makes sense, right? But there’s a major problem with the equation. Amazon is going from being the best firm at delivering products… to being one of the worst. From Pick-Up Lines to Picket Lines In the past, the United Parcel Service would leave the parcels at your doorstep. Instead, USPS wants to cram it into your mailbox. But if you miss your mail for a day or the package doesn’t fit into your mailbox, you’re out of luck… the parcels end up back in the dead letter room at your local post office. So instead of delivery, the Amazon customer has to go to pick up the package at the Post Office. That’s a line even more dreaded than Wal-Mart’s. Americans hate standing in the USPS line. And this is what’s happening to thousands of Amazon customers around the nation. Instead of enjoying the delivery of Amazon Prime, you’re now faced with the hell of waiting in the line at the Post Office. What sounded like a good idea on paper is a disaster for the Amazon customer. I wonder if Jeff Bezos and the other leaders of Amazon know what they’re doing to their own customers. If this keeps up, they soon will.

Comments (246) Lonnie Philpott says: November 26, 2014 at 6:29 am Not much different at UPS. Every time I order something it seems there is a reason why it cannot be left at the house so a trip to the UPS office is in order and their lines and lack of caring is as bad or worse than USPS. I, for one, get better service from USPS. [Reply] V Paiva Reply: November 26th, 2014 at 12:04 pm Not only is a trip to UPS as bad as USPS, but here where I live I have to travel to another city to the UPS terminal. There isn’t one in this city. [Reply] Heather Reply: January 27th, 2015 at 12:59 pm My issue with the USPS delivery is that to fulfill their Amazon two day obligation they mark the package as delivered when they never even came to my house. Has happened at least ten times. This is hurting small business owners who use USPS and then have to eat the coast of the first order. I’ve called the post office before and I know they are lying about the delivery and I say that I will report it to the shipper and they just say “go ahead”. They have to scan a bar code on my mailbox for mail delivery. Not sure why they wouldn’t have to do that for packages. It’s a total scam. [Reply] Richard Reply: March 26th, 2015 at 11:44 am I agree! This has happened to me as well. I was definitely home early and awaiting my package in the room where a knock or doorbell would have definitely been heard. Screw them. My item was cheap. I’ll just not pick it up at all and they have send it back costing them more labor as I order my item from some place else. I don’t mind picking it up if they had actually come and missed me but they definitely lied in my case. Mike Reply: April 23rd, 2015 at 7:31 pm This has happened to me several times recently. Our post office here in Corpus Christi says they “attempted delivery” but I was home each time and the doorbell never rang. I have had to wait until Saturday, when I am not working, to drive up to the post office to pick up my package. They have lost a priority mailed package and certified letter as well in recent weeks. I ask for a manager and the are always conveniently unavailable and never return my calls. I am done with USPS, and if Amazon doesn’t begin to offer options other than USPS I will cancel my prime membership and be done with Amazon. WhyMeLord Reply: August 8th, 2015 at 2:02 pm I can receive a package from China faster than I can a package sent one (small) town over. FWIW I can walk to that shipper’s location faster than USPS delivers. The problem has gotten so bad that on our purchase orders we advise vendors that any package shipped via USP is at their risk. USP tracking confirms the deliver two or three days BEFORE it is delivered. Complaints to Postal inspector are ignored. A letter to the Postmaster by name sent to the Washington Office the address was provided by my congress critter) was returned stamped “Addressee Unknown” david Reply: January 11th, 2016 at 10:21 pm The barcode they scan on your mailbox has nothing to do with your deliver of mail. That is scanned to show where they are at a given time and would be scanned regardless of whether you had mail or not. I’m curious why you people have so many problems having Amazon packages not delivered. 99% of the packages that Amazon sends out are sent “carrier-leave if not response” meaning the packages should be left whether you’re home or not. I’d drop that on the post office next time you call. Leaving that isn’t even optional for the carrier. great grandma Reply: February 13th, 2016 at 8:42 am Two companies that I ordered on line from,one sent UPS,but had them delivered to the Post Office,the other sent Fed Ex,who they also delivered to the Post Office.I will not order from either of these companies again.Ask who will be delivering your package,but make sure you ask if that company will be making that delivery to your home. Mike Reply: March 3rd, 2016 at 10:19 am Exactly right. This mostly happens for Sunday delivery. They simply will not deliver on Sunday. They lie about trying. I have been home and nothing was left on the door AND it was marked “LEAVE” which requires nothing else. Magically, the next business day they leave it at the door. Greg Brandeau Reply: December 30th, 2014 at 3:51 am I’m not sure if it is where I live (LA) or something else, but both USPS and UPS are terrific at leaving packages at my house that won’t fit in my mailbox and/or that need to be signed for. In addition, both UPS and USPS allow you to re-route your package or sign for your package on their websites. My experience with Amazon and USPS over the holidays has been fantastic! Same with UPS. [Reply] Andrew R. Reply: March 12th, 2015 at 7:50 pm I live in Baton Rouge, LA. I have had the same experience. However, my friends and family do not. I think it depends on the letter carrier and their delivery schedule. My packages always come to my doorstep on time. I have relatives that have home security cameras. We have evidence of the letter carrier leaving a notice in their mailbox instead of attempting a delivery. As a result of this, they only choose the one day shipping on Amazon so that UPS or FedEx will make a successful delivery. [Reply] Dawn N Reply: May 30th, 2015 at 9:54 pm I chose 1 day delivery, and it’s being shipped via USPS. JJthe DAGGER Reply: June 29th, 2015 at 8:45 pm I don’t get this. I’m a carrier with the USPS and I would rather deliver a package then sit in front of your mailbox and fill out a slip for you to pick the package up at the USPS, haul your package around all day and then haul it back into the office. I really can’t comprehend why any carrier would do this when most days you barely have any room to move. I question the validity of your responses. Think about what I just wrote because this leaving notices and hauling a full truck of parcels back to unload at the local USPS doesn’t sound realistic. I think most of you just have an ax to grind and decided to talk out of your rears. steven Reply: May 7th, 2015 at 8:56 am I work for the USPS and we are instructed to leave parcels at the doorstep unless it’s not considered safe or bad weather [Reply] Charlene Reply: October 21st, 2015 at 12:40 pm Well, you don’t work for every state now do you! People are not going to find the time to come on here and make a crazy remarks for the fun of it. I have been a amazon customer since 2000 and postal service has slacked off for about a year now in my area. I don’t get my packages left on my premises even though its secured and of course I am the one who is placing the order so I am fully aware that I would not be home to receive it. People do work and that was the benefit for becoming a prime member in the first place and be able to enjoy the 3 day delivery. Even now requesting redelivery attempts are not made until after my 3 requests on the USPS website. I don’t see the logic is wasting gas to come all the way to my home just to go back and dump it at the post office. If this is the method that supervisors are telling their workers to get people to come into the Post office then its a dumb idea. I can have a tiny amazon package that has a scented oil in the box go back to the post office! It’s ludicrous. Sm Reply: November 28th, 2015 at 4:50 am Same here. Been with USPS for a year. Its a total pain in the a$$ to bring parcels back with me. The only way I do is if the business is closed or it’s a signature confirmation and they weren’t home. RachelK Reply: February 7th, 2016 at 10:33 am The issues we have with nondelivery are that the carrier doesn’t even bring the packages, because my spouse has met him at the mailbox while he was filling out the slip and my spouse asked where the package was and the carrier responded that he left it back at the post office. We’ve also had A LOT of packages stolen, even spoke with an 1811 who said they are aware there are a lot of thefts going on and there is an active investigation (in other words, tough luck to us.) As I type this, I’ve had a puppet that I ordered for my play therapy kit marked as delivered, and it never was. Sadly, most of what disappears through the Houston Street office is toys (both sending and receiving.) and identification (My husband was notified that his DL was being used by someone else, the DL that disappeared at the Houston St office 3x.) I will probably order my books and play therapy stuff through other sellers that use UPS or Fed Ex. My Amazon Prime account though, I may just not renew because we never use it like netflix, and with everything going through USPS (meaning I may not get everything) it’s not worth the money. Joe Reply: July 2nd, 2015 at 4:21 pm I’m on hold with UPS right now and Amazon and I are begging them to allow store pick-up as I won’t be home to sign for the package. Instead of working with Amazon to fulfill MY request, this is supposed to be about me I thought, UPS is insistent they most uphold the terms of their contract with Amazon though we are requesting flexibility to fulfill my request. I guess it’s more important that the contract, which I’m not party to, be upheld despite Amazon’s request then the sale be completed. I thought “the market” was about responsiveness to customer needs? [Reply] sam Reply: October 26th, 2016 at 7:45 pm The customer you refer to is not the receiver of the package; for the delivery company their customer is the shipper who pays the postage. Terry Lamb Reply: January 19th, 2015 at 1:53 pm I think this author has been smoking something! Here it is, MLK day and the USPS just 2 packages at my front door. I get excellent delivery service no matter how they ship my order so go boycott all you want! [Reply] Numnutz2005 Reply: February 22nd, 2015 at 6:23 pm Thats imposible dude….usps delivers NO packages on MLK day so if your going to lie at least make sense. Their holiday schedule is posted on their site too. [Reply] Mike Reply: February 23rd, 2015 at 4:13 pm I work for USPS. We worked MLK day. Amazon packages go 365 except christmas and thanksgiving. Whether we deliver mail or not that day, Amazon goes. Paul Reply: October 12th, 2015 at 10:34 am its Columbus day, my carrier just made a delivery from amazon, spoke with carrier, she told they are required to deliver all amazon packages, my regular mail was not delivered today William Doores Reply: February 25th, 2015 at 2:36 pm Speak for yourself Mike. I can’t get a package delivered by the Post Office. I think it is mainly because my carrier is too lazy or too stupid to do his job. I NEVER use the Post Office to mail a package. Some of them couldn’t pour piss out of a boot. [Reply] Jo Reply: July 3rd, 2015 at 8:10 pm You don’t know what you are talking about, William Doores. Calling a carrier lazy or stupid…? Grow up a-hole… sam Reply: October 26th, 2016 at 7:49 pm This idiot William Doores needs to go to work at USPS and see what it is all about☺ Noah Reply: March 4th, 2015 at 5:07 pm My thing is if I wanted to go out and get something I purchased on amazon I would’ve just gone to the store. What I see is packages going straight to the post office for pickup so I can sign for them here as if I couldn’t do that if the mail man brought it here anyway. [Reply] Mego Reply: July 15th, 2015 at 6:56 pm I am a Seattleite that is fed up with this “deal with the devil” Amazon has made with USPS. Amazon’s poor choice of shipping results in many lost hours & frustration to me, the customer. As a business owner, the hours I spend tracking down shipments, calling their customer service for refunds, not to mention the time I spent researching and ordering the items I chose to begin with – makes AMAZON the most COSTLY PLACE for me to spend money anymore. USPS will not even get out of their truck to walk a package to your front door. Nor do I have an option of choosing a delivery method that is reliable for me, the CUSTOMER. I just spent 45 minutes on the phone to cancel almost $700 worth of merchandise I purchased within the last couple of days. I received that same text message everyone else is talking about here: “Delivery Attempted: We were not able to deliver your Amazon package with Fujitsu ScanSnap IX 500 Scanner and 4 other items. We’ll try again tomorrow. Then it leaves tracking information.” When I log into my account it says I need to look for the Notice left on my door for further instructions. No Notice. Why? Because they didn’t even bother to get their lazy you-know-whats out of the truck to walk to the door. I have been waiting since 8:00 this morning and it is now 3:50 pm (PST) Nobody even ‘attempted’ to deliver and they couldn’t care less about the time Amazon’s customer’s waste away from work or other important parts of their lives as AMAZON & USPS continue to disappoint again and again. For condominiums (aka multifamily housing) USPS will only drop everything off at an office location on site wherein it is immediately lost, broken or only open during business hours – which are the same hours everyone else is at work! This is ridiculously frustrating and absolutely NOT “Customer-centric.” I used to have a lot of respect for Jeff Bezos and his philosophy to build a business by creating it from the customer point of view. Obviously he hasn’t googled his own shipping problems for quite a few years as rants about this same issue go back for years. This is nothing new and Amazon stands silent on the issue IGNORING THEIR CUSTOMERS. There are plenty of alternatives and AMAZON PRIME isn’t really worth much without the 2-day shipping guarantee. Buying from e-bay or a MULTITUDE of other online retail stores not to mention just walking into a local store is so much less frustrating and much more satisfying for my overall customer experience. Shame on you Amazon. This Seattleite is taking her business elsewhere from now on. You owe your customers a public apology for this fiasco. [Reply] Jen Reply: September 6th, 2015 at 4:29 pm Amazon bans you permanently from buying on their website if you complain or return items as well! Their attitude is basically you take what we give you regardless of what the terms were when you ordered, or you can stick it you-know-where. Customer-centric – haha what a joke! [Reply] Bmack Reply: August 27th, 2015 at 10:20 pm I work at a post office in Youngstown, Ohio and I ALWAYS choose UPS or FedEx when I have the option. I told my Postal manager that 2 Amazon Prime packages were not delivered. He just laughed! [Reply] Frank Reply: September 19th, 2015 at 9:30 am I don’t care how my items come ups or fed ex I just prefer not the postal service. The idiots that deliver my mail can’t read. On this route we have yelled for years about wrong house number or wrong street on the mail. For some reason they can’t read the whole address when you call to complain all you get is we got a new carrier again since this walking house to house is too hard for one to stay on the route. I can’t even tell you how many deliveries have been lost both that I know about and never knew. I try to get everything shipped ups instead of USPS at least I know they will deliver it. If I ship something out I have to go to the post office and pay the extra signature required just to make sure it goes to the right place. I laugh every time I see those commercials about the USPS dedication to your mail. I understand there may be mistakes once on awhile but this happens every week for over 3 years now. [Reply] K. Miehl Reply: December 19th, 2015 at 1:13 am I have lost 2 packeages for my Christmas orders within 2 weeks !!!! This has never happened to me before, with Amazon using UPS for delivery.

Packages are being sent through FedEx and when the package reaches the nearest city they are given to the USPS adding 3 more days to the shipping. In addition, if a product doesn’t work, the customer has to pay for return shipping and the customer is charged for the original shipping on top of it. Therefore, I ended up paying $8 for a product I don’t have. [Reply] Veronica E Lowe Reply: February 2nd, 2015 at 1:20 pm that handoff only occurs when you use free super saver shipping. this article is about amazon prime. that said, however, I’ve had no problem with either one being left at the door. and have always received any packages with guaranteed delivery dates, on that date. [Reply] Namma Reply: February 6th, 2015 at 11:38 am That’s not true. I’ve been a Prime member for three years and the last seven month have been horrendous in getting a package delivered. One even was labeled Parcel Post even though I have never changed my default Prime Membership shipping method of 2 days. My last order was sent UPS Ground. Amazon is experimenting, however, they fail in that there is NO feedback and no way for the customer to insist on not using certain methods such as SurePost, SmartPost, etc., etc. WE, the customer, KNOW our delivery carriers strengths and weaknesses and Amazon DOES NOT. Nor is there a direct mechanism in place for Amazon to collect customer feedback about shipping and take the no doubt thousands of complaints up with their “shipping partners” as being violations of the contract, IF they included this in the contract. Hopefully they aren’t that stupid. If this continues I will quit Prime. There’s no point to it since the offerings on the remainder of Prime seem to fit a much younger demographic and are not to my taste. Businesses NEED to remember that they NEED the customer more than the customer needs them. If you doubt this simply search – DIY – and see the resurgence in making things on your own cutting out the merchant and the delivery nightmare that many have resorted to. 543 millions results are about what you will get. [Reply] Andrew R. Reply: March 12th, 2015 at 8:00 pm I completely agree. I don’t understand why the customer can’t be given the option to choose the shipping carrier as opposed to the delivery time. All three carriers are more than willing to negotiate and Amazon already has a built in shipping calculator. I wish Amazon would have the options laid out plain and simple, instead of letting the system or seller choose one by default. Example: What Amazon Currently Has: 1 Day Shipping- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) 2 Day Shipping- FREE (Guaranteed by March 15, 2015) Standard Shipping – FREE (Guaranteed by March 20, 2015) What I Would Like: UPS Next Day Air- $4.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) FedEx Standard Overnight- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) USPS Priority Mail Express- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14/15, 2015 depending on location) UPS 2nd Day Air- FREE FedEx 2Day- FREE USPS Priority Mail 2/3 Day- FREE UPS Ground- FREE FedEx Home Delivery- FREE USPS Parcel Select- FREE, $1 Back on Prime Membership Cost This way the customer has the option of choosing the delivery time AND shipping carrier. David Reply: June 3rd, 2015 at 8:28 pm Are you high? You can’t understand because your clueless of what the actual cost of shipping is, that’s made abundantly clear with this UPS Next Day Air- $4.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) FedEx Standard Overnight- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14, 2015) USPS Priority Mail Express- $3.99 (Guaranteed by March 14/15, 2015 depending on location) USPS offers flat rate boxes at 44$ But you somehow think your 99 bucks means that amazon should eat 40 bucks. Mego Reply: July 15th, 2015 at 7:00 pm Well said, Namma Tim Reply: August 30th, 2015 at 2:57 pm I agree. Amazon should allow the customer to choose the method – company, speed and cost – of shipping items they want. If you like priority mail, choose USPS, if you like UPS or FEDEX choose them. The company’s shipping matrix is broken. sam Reply: October 26th, 2016 at 7:57 pm GET OFF YOUR REAR END AND GO SHOPPING!!!!!

I used Amazon.com credit card, then it says use the free 2 day since I have prime. Dec 1. it says 2 day, plus I checked weekends are good, too. Friday gets here, no package. Then it is changed to Sunday. They apparently kept driving from central California, past Albany, Oregon another 1.5 hours to Portland. Then took the package all the way back to Albany, close to where I live. I gave them both my Box number and my physical address to make sure I get it. What could go wrong? They locked up my package in Albany and changed it to Dec 8. Now my 2 day delivery is locked up 20 minute from me and will be one week late. Screw Amazon, screw UPS! Screw Amazon credit card. I don’t need them. I have 50 CC’s, others with zero balance. Shove Amazon prime! 15 years of doing business with Amazon, and it just goes downhill. [Reply] Karen Reply: August 20th, 2015 at 7:35 am I worked for UPS for 27 years and recently retired. I can pretty much guarantee that UPS is not losing Amazon. What is happening is UPS and FedEx is contracting with the post office to pick up these packages in bulk from the shipper like Amazon, deliver to the post office and pay $1.00 for each package delivered that can be put in a mailbox. If an address is scanned in the UPS system like a large box that won’t fit in a mailbox and a smaller package is going to same address they are delivered by UPS, but if a small package is the only one going to that address it will be taken to post office for delivery. As drivers we didn’t like this because it held up the package for a day and customers couldn’t understand why it said UPS was delivering but it came by USPS. We could never understand how this could be profitable but I can guarantee that if it wasn’t UPS wouldn’t do it. Hopefully I have cleared up some of this but I may have made it more confusing. [Reply] Joe Reply: September 18th, 2015 at 7:37 am That is completely right. UPS takes packages to almost every post office every day. They give USPS packages that are not cost effective for their delivery person to deliver. [Reply] i hate people Reply: January 4th, 2016 at 3:28 pm No, you guys are dead wrong. I work at USPS, and Amazon made a deal with USPS to allow them to deliver their packages on Sundays. FedEx, UPS, and most carrier companies don’t deliver on Sunday but the post office do now. This is a contract between USPS and Amazon, and it has absolutely nothing to do with UPS and FedEx, and they are losing out in the end. Tom says: November 26, 2014 at 6:48 am Maybe you order things too small. I ordered from Amazon just last week, and UPS delivered yesterday to me. However, much of what FedEx has been charged with delivering by sellers has been coming the final step via USPS. Almost everything that has FedEx charges, USPS delivers to me.

Make sure you read delivery date. Not shipping date. [Reply] Kodster says: November 26, 2014 at 10:10 am I don’t have any problem with Amazon… I’m a Prime member, and I specifically choose a street shipping address in order to get the expedited, guaranteed shipping of 2-days, because I have a PO Box, as well, and that’s my billing address. I’m REQUIRED to have a PO Box in the town I live in, since I live within the city limits. The only issue I have is with FedEx… if they do SmartPost (deliver to the post office, who in turn delivers to me), I don’t have any issues… however, if they are required to deliver directly to my home? Forget it. If I’m lucky, I’ll see the package a week later than it was supposed to be guaranteed to be delivered. UPS… no problems, right on time, and as expected. Point is, we ALL have issues with the delivery systems that Amazon contracts with. Until people get it in their heads that they, as well as we, are customers of each other, and should treat each accordingly (that Golden Rule… treat others as you would want to be treated yourself), nothing is going to change.

It also happened when my friend bought me a hardrive through Amazon with expedited shipping and tracking showed that it was delivered but there was absolutely NOTHING in my mailbox nor anything at front door, porch, ANYWHERE! ! And OF COURSE it just happened to me again! Tracking said that it was delivered Monday july 13,2015. And I haven’t seen my package ANYWHERE nor was there even any notices left for me!! I think that the mail lady here COULD POSSIBLY be stealing the amazon packages. Or she’s just so much in a hurry that she could have placed it with one of my neighbors packages. I’ve seen her scanning A LOT of packages ALL ONE AFTER ANOTHER and not put them in the mailbox after each scan. (I was tanning at the pool, mailboxes for our apartment complex is in clear view from the pool). I’ve received my neighbors packages with my packages SOOOOO many times before. I have the courtesy to just hand deliver them to the correct address (knocking at my neighbor’s door, if they aren’t home then I leave it at their front door) . That’s not my job to do that. But I do that only because I KNOW how it feels to lose a package. .. the USPS here in La Verne Had no phone number to call and complain to. No 800 number …nothing.. and the people at the post office don’t even bother to check. When my boyfriend went in there to try to pick up his package that was never delivered, the lady told him to come back later so that she has time to look for it. He came back a few hours later and she said she didn’t get to check yet. He asked her to please go and check, all she did was walk in the doors and walked right back out and said she couldn’t find it…. it’s like WTF??!! YOU DIDN’T EVEN BOTHER LOOKING AROUND AND DIDN’T ACTUALLY CHECK ALL YOU DID WAS WALK IN AND RIGHT BACK OUT OF THE DOORS!! … no manager was available to complain to. .. USPS F***ING SUCKS! ! AND IS ALWAYS LOSING PACKAGES! !! ANY PACKAGES THROUGH UPS IS ALWAYS on time and I’d any delays.. you would know. .. customers are always able to know where their packages are with UPS. … I’M SO SICK OF LOSING PACKAGES THAT ARE BOUGHT THOUGH AMAZON!! It almost seems like a scam. Especially when you have paid extra for expedited shipping! And suddenly never receive it but tracking shows delivered! ! Soooo shady!!

Lately I’ve come to think of myself as an unpaid USPS employee, who has taken on the job of re-delivering packages mis-delivered by my carrier.

Since USPS workers can access apartment buildings they can reach your apartment directly. This a problem for FedEx and UPS. The difference is that FedEx does allow you to pick up your package after certain hours. Good luck doing this with UPS. Overall, I’m glad that Amazon is not using UPS anymore. [Reply] THE POSTMAN says: November 26, 2014 at 4:11 pm Mr. Brown you can calm your nerves. The USPS has instructions (at least in south east Texas) to leave any Amazon package at the customers door, no matter what. So if you have the type of address where the postman has access to your front door, the package will be left. Have you communicated with your postman? Simple, DIRECT communication with your postman goes a long way to getting those Amazon packages delivered right.

[Reply] Jeff W says: November 27, 2014 at 10:18 am I don’t know who the author of this piece is but his bias against the USPS is pretty obvious. Also, he is completely wrong about how USPS delivers. I have worked at the USPS for 20 years , the last 8 have been in a branch office. I see Amazon packages everyday, brought to us from both fed ex and UPS for last mile delivery. On average between both carriers about 500-600 parcels a day, many more right now. I am also a loyal amazon prime customer, and have been for more than 5 years. Gotten many things from them as well. First of all, UPS still delivers Amazon. It does depend on size since UPS started doing dimensional pricing. If it is small, they will probably not deliver. But in some cases they do. I see people everyday come in our PO, complain about our price and say they are going to UPS. They always come back. As far as your package delivery, we leave parcels at places all the time! I have no idea where you live, but unless it is in a place where the carrier think it is unsafe, they will leave that parcel. If they don’t call and complain. Personally I would rather have someone who cares about my security than just leaving it and going. Also, sign the notice left for you and they will received. Happens all the time. This is really another case of some anti federal government idiot who thinks life would be better and his prices lower if we did not exist. We are the only ones that will deliver to every address. That is why the others drop off to us…they can’t deliver to certain places and keep costs down. If we weren’t around, you would be paying through the nose or driving to a centralized pick up point for your parcels. And as far as waiting at the PO for stuff, management has cut our staffing back so much that we cannot keep our unit fully staffed. That is a whole different issue that I would love to discuss with this moron. Bottom line, we do it right and it most cases cheaper. If he has problems I dare say they are of his own creation. This article was a biased piece of untruths and blather. [Reply] Ron W Reply: December 27th, 2014 at 10:43 am Jeff says they do it cheaper than fed-ex or ups. What about the Billions of dollars the post office lose each year. If they had to make a profit like private business does to stay in business. These billion dollar losses have to be paid sooner or later by the tax payers. The USPS would be higher than private services if they had to recoup their cost of doing business and having taxpayers pay. [Reply] Brian Reply: January 25th, 2015 at 1:19 am Usps does not receive any taxpayer money. Do your homework before you say stupid things.

The only business or branch of the government forced to do this. And none of the is taxpayer money.

Tracking say delivery attempted- couldn’t leave unattended. In variably the package appears the next day in or on my mail box which several hundred feet from my house next to a major expressway. A Macbook Air was left “unattended” on top of mail box in the rain. Found it before water had reached the laptop. Waiting today for package tracking says will be delivered by 8pm today, BS, won’t see it till Monday. [Reply] Chaupt Reply: February 18th, 2015 at 9:06 pm If the box is say 40-50lbs, USPS has either left if in the middle of my driveway so I have to get out of my car to remove it, or they put an “attempted delivery” notice in my mailbox and make me drive out of my way to go get it after standing in line to turn in the slip and waiting for them to find where the box was stashed and then get a dolly to roll it out to me. Amazon! This is not acceptable. And, yes, I have had the trouble of them smashing items that don’t really fit into the mailbox too! Had to actually cut one apart piece by piece to get at the item inside!! [Reply] Robbie Reply: February 21st, 2015 at 3:52 pm I don’t know if it’s regional or not, but the USPS carrier for my area will not leave any packages at the front door. If it won’t fit in the mailbox, it goes back to the post office. I am disabled and cannot get to the mailbox every day. Things were much better for me when Amazon used UPS and I could get everything delivered to the front door. [Reply] Dan Reply: April 23rd, 2015 at 6:26 pm I don’t have an issue with my carrier, but the USPS has gotten so slow in my area, its plain ridiculous. It takes 7 days for a letter to get from Florida to Maine. Packages that use the USPS take 3-5 days longer than with UPS/FEDEX. Why does it take 2 days for a package to be delivered by my local postman? They tell me it’s because Amazon and some other stores use palletized shipping. It’s great if you are served by a post office serving thousands, but the rural post offices get the stuff when UPS/FEDEX feels like dropping off a pallet. Small PO’s may not get a pallet every day. It’s all about saving money, and I understand, but deliver that slow should be much cheaper than regular FEDEX or UPS. [Reply] Jenna says: November 27, 2014 at 4:32 pm I completely disagree!! It really depends on what you have ordered. I love Amazon like you do. And my brother has an Amazon prime membership as well. I have seen Amazon deliveries coming from UPS as well. I agree USPS delivers most of them BUT I can never blame them for poor service. Most of the times, my package is left at my front porch (behind a pillar) and my area has low theft rate (central CA). And in case the USPS employee takes it along, I do not encounter long lines- cause I know the USPS office opens at 8am when there will be no one there. If I am expecting a delivery today and I am too lazy to get it from the post office, then I’ll be sure to open my door when the postman rings my doorbell. I think Amazon is amazing as usual. Local post offices are closer to homes for a reason. And if they are really that FAR, and the lines are really that long 24/7, then shop at Walmart. 😉 [Reply] Dwiniger says: November 27, 2014 at 7:42 pm So true. Waiting on a watch now. Lost tracking of the item after 3 days when it went to Ohio by mistake. I paid for Prime. Item only needed to ship less than 100 miles from origin to my house. Instead it left the state and nobody knows why or can tell me when to expect delivery. Amazon Prime? USPS? What a waste. Amazon literally laughed at me when I called them. They said to reorder another one. Brilliant advice! Defines insanity right??? [Reply] Steve says: November 27, 2014 at 9:31 pm Normal people would just get on the internet at USPS.com and set up a new deliver date, or just call the toll free number to get the item redelivered. Floyd Brown isn’t the brightest light shining… [Reply] Robert says: November 28, 2014 at 6:52 am This article is absolutely stupid. Anyone can simply call the phone number on back of USPS notice and request a new delivery date or just sign the back and write in when you want your package brought back out, it has a section for that on back if you read the notice then simply put in your mailbox and flip up your flag and they bring it back out on day you request. No lines, No fuss…..I love that Amazon uses USPS now. I seem to get my stuff even faster now. [Reply] Annette says: November 28, 2014 at 7:52 am Starting with Floyd Brown, some of these comments are way off. The USPS does not return the amazon packages that do not fit in your box. As a matter of fact, carriers have specific instruction to leave the package at the door step even if no response at the door. Also, as for the FedEx packages that USPS delivers, it may take FedEx a week to ship to USPS; however carriers are required to deliver no later than next day. Track your shipment on the internet and you’ll see exactly what I’m saying. Stop trash talking, particularly when you obviously do not know what you’re talking about. Facts First! [Reply] Shannon Reply: February 17th, 2015 at 3:10 am Untrue, they WILL claim it doesn’t fit in the box. I was supposed to receive a package today but did not. The tracking shows a notice was left that it was undeliverable due to being too large for the box OR that my box was too full. My box was empty of anything, including a notice of any sort. The Amazon customer service guy told me on his end it showed USPS would deliver tomorrow. Everything the author complains about in this post, I have experienced. I am also fed up with Amazon Prime due solely to their use of our horrible local USPS. [Reply] Amy says: November 28, 2014 at 8:28 am I disagree with the post. I have been using Amazon like you from just about the beginning and yes I have noticed that USPS delivers a lot more, BUT I have never had a problem with packages left by my door or somewhere on my porch if it doesn’t fit. NOT once have I had to go to the post office to pick up. [Reply] Lenny Reply: December 15th, 2014 at 12:48 pm Wrong! USPS leaves a little notification in my mail box stating that I need to pick up the package. I have to leave work early to stand in line at the Post Office. More than six times so far since October of this year. It’s pure laziness. UPS and Fedex ALWAYS delivered to my door. like most, I’m at work during the day when deliveries are suppose to be made. Complaining to my local Post Office hasn’t helped. Coming home to a package waiting for me at the door was what made the Amazon ordering process great. That seems to be over now. I have a large number of co-workers that have the same complaint. Annette, it may be different from your experience however, please do a few Google searches and it will become clear to you that this is a problem for thousands of us. Maybe YOU should get the facts first. [Reply] Jamie F. says: November 28, 2014 at 8:36 am You know what’s worse than having to trek down to the postal service? Leaving a package outside my backdoor during a rainstorm that’s been going on for several days! No, not a freak, oops, it ended up raining, a serious rain storm! I’d rather travel a few miles to get my stuff from the postal service instead of having it ruined and get a “you don’t have insurance” excuse, which Amazon does not offer. [Reply] Jesse says: November 28, 2014 at 9:15 am I loved amazon, but now it seems like every order comes from USPS. I have never not had a bad experience with USPS. Unless they stop sending it with them and go back to the old way I will not continue my subscription and just get off my lazy butt and go pick the stuff up at the stores. [Reply] Jan says: November 28, 2014 at 9:21 am I haven’t had much trouble with Amazon, I get my kindle e books from them. Never a problem. Once in a while I order a regular book for my brother who is in prison and they follow through. I never had a problem with returns. They always give me credit back to my credit card and a return label. So Amazon is like everyone else: some like them, some don’t. [Reply] chad says: November 28, 2014 at 10:35 am I work for UPS and the USPS Amazon packages are parcel post and are too small for a driver to deliver it. Many times we deliver to a post office, a huge bag of letters and “smells” this is a way to help the post office out with business, and it helps UPS to focus on priority mail, ex. Next day air, Savers, two days, and just regular ground. When you have an organ on ice that is being shipped to a local hospital…..and you have the latest Nicholas Sparks book for a resident… It is easier to forget the book and give it to the mail service so you can focus on the priority. Hopefully this helps some of you understand this more. [Reply] Dustin Thomas says: November 28, 2014 at 3:48 pm I like the move to more USPS. I get my packages on Saturday or Sunday now when I’m actually home. My block has parcel lockers for when I’m not. UPS just “hides” them under the mat. Let’s be honest. USPS is cheaper anyway. They are lowering prices while UPS and FedEx are raising them. [Reply] Tiffany says: November 28, 2014 at 4:41 pm I think your article is very bias and left out much relevant information. I am an avid Prime user and I have many relatives that work for the USPS. You did not address the fact that you could actually schedule a redelivery online and make a request for the carrier to leave the package at your front step. You also left out that if you have to go to the USPS office for the package, they have a separate line (which is never long) for just picking up packages. Here’s another piece of info your “journalistic” writing failed to disclose: one of the reasons why Amazon did not extend their UPS contract is because they did not meet the 100% tracking protocol, while surprisingly, USPS did. Your article is full of misleading information. I wonder what your intentions were in writing this article? Maybe you want to SABOTAGE Amazon? Sorry, that’s pretty much impossible but your article is high up in SEO when I did a search for the USPS. Guess that was your strategy? [Reply] Quasi reporte^^ says: November 29, 2014 at 12:30 am What a misleading piece of ‘journalism’. Parcels are left at homes, notified via email of delivery time, and not brought back to a ‘dead letter’ office. Sheeeesh, do a little reseach into reality before relying on myths and/ or propagand. You got paid to do this? Sad. [Reply] Kelley says: November 29, 2014 at 12:38 am I’m preferring USPS these days because with UPS it ties me down waiting for the package whereas with the post office, the package goes in the mailbox and I can pick it up at my convenience. Also USPS packages move on the weekends while they stay put with UPS, which means sometimes the package arrives more quickly. To be fair, sometimes with the post office the pack comes more slowly. [Reply] Wendy says: November 29, 2014 at 12:53 pm I remember a few years ago the UPS strike had a lot of eBay sellers unexpectedly forced to use USPS. Quite a few stayed with USPS, finding UPS wasn’t the bargain they thought it was. As to the headache of standing in line for a package, that depends a lot on the LPO and the individual carrier. I’ve had carriers leave fairly large packages on a sopping wet driveway and fairly small packages held at the LPO. But I’ve rarely had to deal with long lines there. [Reply] Mike says: November 29, 2014 at 10:22 pm Floyd, take a 2nd think! You are obviously anti-USPS! I could tell you stories about white & brown! ALL carriers: brown, white, and red-white-blue, have their problems! And, exactly, where do you go to pick up that package that requires a signature from white or brown? Your U.S. Post Office is right there in your community and open. Have a problem with USPS? Call them and let them know. It is USPS policy to deliver those Amazon packages, and on Sundays in many communities. The USPS recognizes packages are their future. They are not perfect, but still provide a great service to us. [Reply] James Whitmore says: November 30, 2014 at 3:30 pm I am a rural mail carrier for the USPS who leaves parcels at doorsteps when they don’t fit in the mailbox – in addition, the recipient doesn’t have to be at home for me to leave the parcel at their doorstep – unless a signature is required. Other rural mail carriers at the post office where I work (Appleton, Wisconsin) follow the same procedure – we try to minimize trips to the post office whenever possible. I am sorry for your poor service and suggest that you contact your local postmaster, who hopefully will correct the problem. [Reply] Jerry says: November 30, 2014 at 6:32 pm First off, the USPS is the most economical way to ship packages. Second, the USPS services every home 6 days a week and is required by the postal regulatory committee. Third, the post office is actually is in the black 6 billion dollars because of its increase in parcel delivery. Forth, the post office provides free insurance and free tracking of your parcels which was a service that we charged for in the past. Maybe you outta get your facts straight before you bash the largest and oldest employer in the U.S.!!!! [Reply] Chris says: November 30, 2014 at 8:58 pm Every time that I have ordered from Amazon in the most recent past, it has been left at my doorstep by USPS. Packages have also arrived on-time or a day early. No issues in Chicago with needing to be picked up. [Reply] EMW Reply: January 19th, 2015 at 6:23 pm I feel the same. I have received all my packages on time with USPS. With UPS, I have to wait for one attempt for delivery, then let UPS know I want them to hold it, then travel to the UPS center across the river at limited times for pickup. I don’t dislike UPS or FedEx but I much rather USPS because it is more convenient. [Reply] Patricia Lynn says: November 30, 2014 at 10:46 pm I have the exact opposite opinion of this writer. My main concern is security. I DON’T want packages just left at the door, and that’s what UPS does. They either knock and immediately leave, or sometimes don’t even knock. I MUCH prefer having packages delivered to the apartment’s secure postal boxes, or having them delivered to my door by the USPS or any company OTHER THAN UPS, because none of them have ever just left a package outside my door where it might easily be stolen. I wish we were always allowed a choice of delivery method, because I would never choose UPS. [Reply] Pete says: December 2, 2014 at 1:31 am I usually get the packages delivered to my office address and I bring them home. That has been quite convenient for me. Pete [Reply] Denny says: December 4, 2014 at 10:17 pm I completely agreed. Just had 154 dollars refunded because the post office marked the items as delivered and I never got them. I decided not to purchase the items again and hit the stores. They are not only going to lose money but also customers. [Reply] Luke says: December 5, 2014 at 10:52 pm I agree with this article entirely. Amazon used to ship only small low cost items by Surepost and Smartpost. Now it seems almost anything can go this route. Here is a typical Surepost shipping experience for me, today is December 5th and the order seems to be lost. I have another just like it shipped a few days prior… December 3, 2014, 10:18 am, Statesville NC US A carrier delay has occurred December 3, 2014, 6:14 am, — Package arrived at a carrier facility December 2, 2014, 10:04 am, Statesville NC US Package has been transferred to the USPS and will be delivered by your local postal office December 2, 2014, 4:09 am, Statesville NC US Package arrived at a carrier facility December 2, 2014, 1:43 am, Statesville NC US Package arrived at a carrier facility December 2, 2014, 12:28 am, Greensboro NC US Package has left the carrier facility December 1, 2014, 8:25 pm, Greensboro NC US Package arrived at a carrier facility December 1, 2014, 5:02 pm, Spartanburg SC US Package has left the carrier facility December 1, 2014, 3:40 pm, Spartanburg SC US Package arrived at a carrier facility December 1, 2014, 3:23 pm, Spartanburg SC US Package has left the carrier facility December 1, 2014, 2:59 pm, Spartanburg SC US Package received by carrier December 1, 2014, 3:03 pm, US Package has left seller facility and is in transit to carrier [Reply] Gene says: December 6, 2014 at 4:52 am Strange, I haven’t noticed any difference as just this week I’ve ordered several things from Amazon using Prime and they were all delivered via UPS. Those who actually frequent real news sources, you know those that actually post sources or links to major announcements such as what you are claiming will know that Amazon is not carrier exclusive. During times of high volume such as Black Friday and Christmas Amazon will expand use of carriers they don’t typically utilize, such as the USPS. Another bonus is if you are a Prime customer and they are late delivering the package you can contact customer service (phone, live chat, and email work) and they will extend your Prime membership by a month or you may get a $10-15 credit to use. If you are not a prime member they will typically refund your shipping costs if it is late and shipped by Amazon. [Reply] Metatrox says: December 8, 2014 at 11:58 am I’m sooo disappointed with USPS. I signed up for prime primarily for the free 2 day shipping. USPS is not guaranteed! Thats not what I pay for! I cant count on them at all. I guess i’ll have to pay the extra for overnight in hopes to get it in 3 days or so! [Reply] Gallie says: December 9, 2014 at 3:26 pm Local USPS has a new contract w/Amazon to “leave if no response.” Several folks in my bldg have had their items stolen, just left on a doorstep on a weekend instead of a pick up at post office notice. [Reply] Joe Reply: December 18th, 2014 at 8:47 pm If you get a USPS account you can give delivery instructions on the tracking number page (eg authorize to leave with neighbor or custodian, put a hold on it etc.). It gets messed up if you do it before the item arrives at your local post office. UPS and FedEx accounts provide similar features. It doesn’t cost anything to sign up. [Reply] larry Reply: February 23rd, 2015 at 6:19 pm Amazon makes the USPS deliver rain or shine even when the front porch is not covered enough to keep parcels out of the rain. Amazon parcels are not brought back. [Reply] FlyEagleVA says: December 10, 2014 at 2:08 am Been a Prime subscriber for around five years. Can’t remember when something wasn’t delivered as promised. Customer service is great; if they make a mistake they usually give a gift card credit. Exchanges and returns are simple, just print the return label and drop off at a UPS Store. My packages arrive mostly by UPS still with an occasional FedEx. Since Prime is free two day shipping, if they don’t get it out of the warehouse in time, they overnight it FedEx at no extra charge to ensure I get it on the date promised. [Reply] jason says: December 10, 2014 at 2:28 pm I agree. Ever since they dropped UPS. I’ve had UPS come into my apartment and hand deliver me my package now I have to wait outside in the friggen cold to get my parcel which is ridiculous I’m a disabled person and this is irritating… [Reply] Melissa Craig says: December 12, 2014 at 8:20 am I don’t know why you are having a big issue, My mail carrier delivers directly to my door and gives me packages, and delivers on Sunday during the holiday. We love both our UPS and USPS carriers deliver well. [Reply] LINDA Reply: December 15th, 2014 at 1:46 pm Wish mine did. The old carrier was awesome, this new one is sooo lazy. He can’t even close the doors on the mailboxes. [Reply] Chris says: December 12, 2014 at 9:17 pm “Dead letter room”??? You don’t know much about the post office do you? I have delivered thousands of Amazon parcels, it’s a fantastic cooperation between UPS and USPS. They fly them to us and process them down to individual offices then drop them off for us to take out, which eliminates the outdated excuse that USPS ruins every parcel. Most of their parcels won’t fit in a standard mailbox, but that does not mean we take them back to the office. We get out and take them to wherever the customer asks to have their parcels placed, typically the door. I have yet to encounter a package from Amazon requiring a signature, but there really would be no difference between USPS and UPS in regards of a signature, if they aren’t there they get a notification which they can sign and put in their mailbox for re-delivery (something ups can’t do, since they can’t use our mailboxes) or go pick it up at the nearest location and, for rural customers especially, their post office is always closer than a ups facility. [Reply] Brian Reply: January 25th, 2015 at 1:32 am I also have delivered thousands of amazon packages to the door. And we deliver every package the day we get them. Even when UPS brings them late. And we deliver them on Sundays and holidays. And I have only seen one amazon package that required a signature. [Reply] Bill says: December 12, 2014 at 11:02 pm This article is clearly biased against USPS.. Maybe this guy has a lot of UPS stock? I am also a long time and frequent Amazon customer, and the recent change has actually improved my delivery. My UPS depot is on the other side of town, but I can walk to my post office. Also I have yet to have USPS not leave an Amazon package, but I have fought with UPS for years about why they won’t leave a package,. the surly attitude of their drivers, and the way they often smash packages. As much as I wish that Amazon would ditch UPS, I received Amazon packages in the last couple of days from UPS. I also get Fedex and Lasership delivery from Amazon, and have had only minor problems with all of them except UPS. [Reply] Gordon Reply: December 26th, 2014 at 11:27 am I haven’t ordered from Amazon since they switched to USPS but I don’t think they have gained anything. I have had packages delivered by UPS that it took a month to get them after UPS said it was delivered. It finally appeared out by the mailbox. In the mean time I let the vendor know and they sent me a replacement two times. I received 3 of the item before the first order was delivered. I never knew who had the first order. USPS puts the mail in the wrong mailbox until they are driving me crazy. A few days ago they delivered the neighbors mail to our mailbox. They have delivered our mail to neighbors a number of times. Once a check was delivered to a neighbor. It took a week for it to get to us. It had been opened and stapled through the check and the envelope to keep it in. Another time some medicine was delivered to one of the neighbors. Again it was opened before they gave it to us. I think the people delivering and the neighbors need to learn to read and stop opening our mail. [Reply] Michele says: December 13, 2014 at 10:26 pm Fact: Since Amazon signed the contract with the USPS, four (count them, four!) Amazon packages delivered to our Post Office box were immediately and without notification to us *returned* to Amazon as “undeliverable.” We have been Amazon Prime members since 2001. Amazon Customer Service was mortified. We have spoken numerous times to our post office staff, begging them not to do this, to simply do what they would do with any other package we receive (ie, put a notice in our box and we then pick it up). Each time they vacantly nod their head and say they will. Each time our Amazon (and ONLY Amazon) packages are returned without notice to us. And this time – the final straw – was all of the grandchildren’s Christmas presents. Amazon is trying to make up for the incompetence of the USPS by now noting on our account to ONLY deliver via FED EX or UPS to our doorstep. This contract needs to go. I’ve never seen a more worthless group of people. If this is a common occurrence, Amazon will drop them like a hot potato and the USPS will be a thing of the past. [Reply] Marc says: December 15, 2014 at 6:09 pm I’ve got the same problem that Gallie noticed – the reverse of everyone else here. The latest way Amazon is trying to thwart the problem of missed deliveries is to release the carrier from liability for items left on doorsteps. I live in the city in Baltimore, and have had numerous packages, including a $700 camera, stolen in the last couple of months. Unless you, or a worthy neighbor, see a package being left outside your house, it will be stolen in what I would guess to be a matter of seconds. Thieves just follow the mail carrier through town and their Christmas shopping is complete. Idiotic policy. Adding insult to injury, our lazy local mail carrier in Baltimore has since applied the Amazon philosophy to ALL packages being delivered. [Reply] Don Reply: January 3rd, 2015 at 10:46 am Yes, that is my experience in Baltimore too. Have discontinued using Amazon Prime because of its use of the USPS in the Baltimore area. Don’t like my packages being stolen from my front steps, but marked as delivered on the web site. [Reply] samiup says: December 16, 2014 at 5:05 pm I have noticed a difference. and it is a significant one. USPS delivered my package at 3pm,-when i was at work- the notice they left did not say much, no re-delivery attempt… i went to their website in order to ask for re-delivery, USPS web site was not working as i could not pick up a date from the calendar tool after filling up a long form… Then i said, OK maybe ill just pick it up, their office closes at 4:00 pm… WOW! now what should i do now? take a half day off from work to go to USPS everything i order from Amazon? pretty pathetic. Called Amazon, asked for replacement. the item that was “delivered” will leave USPS and go back to Amazon in 15 days… [Reply] I Do Not Like USPS! says: December 20, 2014 at 2:33 pm Another argument against USPS that no one, it seems, noticed: USPS does its delivery run once a day. So, if package has arrived to your local USPS facility at, say, 12PM, but your postman starts delivery route to your street at 11:59AM, you’re out of luck – you will have to wait extra day for your package. UPS will run delivery routes several times a day, as long as there are packages to be delivered. [Reply] larry Reply: February 23rd, 2015 at 5:59 pm Maybe you have noticed that USPS delivers to every house on the route…not just parcels like ups, fedex. If we didnt…maybe we could make double runs. Also your carrier sorts and cases every piece of mail on his route as well as loading his vehicle. [Reply] Paul says: December 22, 2014 at 7:55 pm I have the same problem but I don’t blame UPS or USPS. If I have a guaranteed delivery date for the 24th and I’m told UPS will have it delivered then. I then find out it’s not to me but my post office and I won’t receive several items until the 26th. I called UPS and they said that’s how it is . Guarantee date by them but not USPS. This is all back on Amazon on how they ship now. I didn’t know this and I have been buying part of my Christmas items from them for awhile.

[Reply] Richard says: December 26, 2014 at 8:31 pm Thank you, Mr. Brown, for bringing up this subject. And for those that are getting front door delivery of your mail and parcels from the USPS, I am happy for you. We moved into a neighborhood with new housing during the early part of this summer where front door delivery by the USPS is not available, by design. Instead, mail and parcels are delivered to a mailbox/parcel container clusters located at selected street intersections. I suppose it saves time and money for the USPS to do it this way. If there are no parcel containers vacant or if the package is over sized for the container, the USPS wont leave it, but will leave a notice in the mailbox to have it picked up. We tried several times to have them redeliver packages, but the problem of parcel container vacancies or package size also determine whether the attempt to redeliver is successful or not. When Amazon was shipping by UPS or FedEx, we would always get our packages delivered to the house, always. Now, we get about 30% of our packages if shipped via USPS. We’ve been Prime Members since 2004, and since October, we have substantially cut down our ordering from Amazon because of their heavy use of the USPS as shipper of 90% of our orders. Amazon should give shoppers the option of which carrier to use in order to work around obstacles like mail box clusters. [Reply] Tasha Miles says: December 28, 2014 at 1:22 am Amen to this author!! I too have been one of Amazon’s Number One Fans since early years. I also order all our small business supplies from them to the tune of 30K+ Per year. USPS is a disaster for me because we live on a rural route and we never get packages delivered to the door. This results in a trip to the post office which is 15 miles away and not well run. I can’t find a solution through Amazon. I’m willing to pay more and /or wait longer for my packages JUST DON’T USE USPS! .. but there is no way to opt out. Why a “can do” company like Amazon pairs up with a “can’t do and don’t want to try to do” government agency like the USPS is beyond my understanding. The results were predictable without having an MBA. [Reply] Calvin says: January 9, 2015 at 3:07 pm My problem isn’t so much that they are using the postal service (live an an area where we have the combined mailboxes), it is that they have increased the cost of Prime and are using a cheaper service altogether (USPS). For me it seems like they are trying to boost revenue and at the same time decrease costs. My Prime membership is about to end this January and I do not plan on renewing. $20 price increase for cheaper USPS package deliveries… no thank you. I can wait a few extra days with all the non-primies.

I used to order and then go to my UPS Online account to have my packages held for pickup. Now since they use the US Mail., I have had 5 packages turn up missing. This is horrible. After my amazon prime membership ends this year I am done with Amazon. Also size of package is not the issue. I have ordered……. 1 Sony PS4 bundle with 3 games. It came in a large box via US Mail… [Reply] Chris H Reply: February 14th, 2015 at 9:00 pm I too have had way too many issues with USPS in our area. So I cancelled my prime account that I’ve had since it started. Amazon pro-rated so I didn’t have to worry about losing money. Don’t wait until your membership is up, end it now and save your money. [Reply] Nick says: January 16, 2015 at 6:58 pm I’m not sure where the author lives, but at my house the USPS carrier places letters in the mailbox at the end of my driveway and packages on my front porch. Granted, I live in the suburbs and not a gigantic apartment building, but still the article is very misleading. The only time I’ve had to go to the post office to pick up a package is when a signature is required and I wasn’t home when USPS attempted to deliver. UPS and USPS are both really good about taking a note with my signature on it and leaving a signature required package as well. FedEx on the other hand is awful. They actually refuse to deliver a package early. Let me explain: say a seller uses ups ground to ship a parcel, that service has a 5 day guarantee. Many times it gets to the customer in 2-3 days, everyone is happy in this instance. Well, very recently I had that very thing happen with fedex, except those crooks actually held my package at a processing center for THREE DAYS before finally delivering it. I saw this on the tracking system with the message “package not scheduled for delivery today”, so I called their customer service department and my god were they awful. They could not have cared less, seriously. I even said that USPS and ups would never do something like this. Her response “well that’s our policy”, justifying NOT delivering it “early” and holding it to deliver on the 5th day. Fedex is also not good at all for working around “signature required” restrictions. I once left a note saying it was ok to leave the package at the door and provided my signature and telephone number, only to come home to a snippy “we missed you” flyer with “must get sig in person” written in pen on it. That fedex “smartpost” someone else mentioned (where fedex does the work from origin to destination city, then hands off to USPS for delivery) is another awful set up. That can often end up being a 8 day service in my experience. Needless to say I’d rather drive to pick up my purchase from the origin than be forced to use fedex again! [Reply] EMW says: January 19, 2015 at 5:56 pm This article is incorrect. The USPS has left several packages at my door. I have not had to go to the USPS to get a package.

[Reply] So...When Will Amazon Start with USPS... says: January 21, 2015 at 8:23 pm I just ordered a 1.4 ounce package from across the U.S. and Amazon shipped it via UPS Ground. *facepalm* So I’d like to know when Amazon will start capitalizing on this USPS relationship? [Reply] Anthony D says: January 23, 2015 at 1:39 am I live in an apartment building in NYC. USPS can enter the apartment complex and happily leaves all packages next to my mailbox without asking, if they do not fit inside. If it’s UPS and I don’t happen to be home (which is always), I have to take two buses and walk to the “local” UPS terminal. I for one am thrilled that Amazon will be relying more exclusively on USPS, though almost everything I order tends to come through them anyway.

Ive been a Prime customer for years and I have always had outstanding service. But since November I have had nothing but trouble. Ive always had issues with the post office and try my hardest not to deal with them. I hate that my packages now come through there on a regular basis and it doesnt make sense. I live in Columbia SC where there is a warehouse. Some of my packages, now that the USPS is involved, leave the Columbia warehouse, are shipped to Concord and then back to Columbia to me. What sense does that make? USPS is the worse and I for one, hope they become obsolete altogether. [Reply] Tricia says: February 6, 2015 at 7:04 am I have my Amazon packages delivered to my employer’s street address because UPS cannot get into my building at home. Unfortunately for me, my employer also has a P.O. box so now that USPS is being used, instead of delivering to the street address they mark all my packages as delivered and put them in the P.O. box room and isn’t physically delivered to me until the third day. Therefore, I pay the Prime fee but don’t get the 2 day shipping as promised. [Reply] TC says: February 16, 2015 at 7:06 am USPS is far better than UPS. However Amazon tricks you into thinking you are paying $100 for prime getting free 2 day shipping, while the truth is that Amazon is actually only shipping it normal mail or slower. They get away with it because they have so many warehouses everywhere. But it is false advertising. [Reply] TC says: February 16, 2015 at 7:09 am Many times packages sent by UPS still get dropped off by UPS at the USPS for delivery. [Reply] LW says: February 18, 2015 at 8:49 pm USPS is certainly NOT better than UPS for me. The postal service will not deliver to my door since I live inside a gated community and the USPS’s carrier union contract doesn’t require them to deliver inside the gate, so any parcel that won’t fit inside the small parcel boxes must be picked up from the post office — a 45 minute round trip. Super frustrating! I’ve started breaking up my orders into 1 thing at a time — sometimes one in the morning and one in the evening — to try to keep boxes as small as possible with hopes they’ll fit inside the parcel locker. Plus, I figure it costs Amazon a heck of a lot more by making them ship each item individually, so maybe they’ll reconsider allowing their customers to select their own carriers. [Reply] Tom Reply: March 11th, 2015 at 2:35 am A 45-minute round trip? Why don’t you try living in civilization? [Reply] Reid says: February 23, 2015 at 2:07 pm As others have said USPS carriers marks items as delivered to stay out of trouble for not getting their route finished. Then your lucky if you ever receive item.Next your left proving it didn’t get delivered and good luck with that USPS has no system in place to make sure carriers deliver package. I just had to go to Post Office to file a complaint about 4 packages that say delivered but weren’t. Well guess what they found all 4 in carriers truck in a bag with many other packages from up to a week ago that weren’t delivered. She had been fired they said and it looked like the packages were going to be taken home. No way to know how many end up in dumpsters or worse. [Reply] larry Reply: February 23rd, 2015 at 5:45 pm Packages left in vehicle would be found the next day. I believe you made this up. Also postal management will scan parcels left in office as attempted because the clerks missthrow them and the carriers are instructed to leave them in a tub or on floor by supervisors desk before they leave. These packages may not be delivered until the next day. Try not to blame everything on your carrier especially if you don’t take the time to get to no them as your carrier. [Reply] Ace21 says: February 27, 2015 at 1:58 pm I am fed up with Amazon because of this. What used to take a few days to deliver a package now takes 1-2 WEEKS. Reason being is my UPS location is in a city 30 miles away. Yesterday, a package arrived at UPS, great, should be out for delivery that day. NOPE. Already gone through this once, I immediately contacted UPS so I could drive over and pick up the package. I was told NO, they are required to turn the package over to the Post Office in the city, which then sits on the package for a few more days ‘sorting it’ to be shipped to the Post Office in the city I live in. Once that finally happens, my local post office then sits on it for another day or 2 ‘sorting’ it, all the while the Post Office is telling Amazon the package has been delivered. EVERY SINGLE PACKAGE I have ordered that came USPS has stated ‘delivered’ when checked online at least 1-2 days BEFORE the package is actually delivered. Today, I just looked, and the post office is stating package is delivered, yet, it is still sitting in a post office in a different city from which I live in. No more Amazon for me if this is the service I can come to expect. I will pay a few more dollars to buy items as local as possible and if they have to be shipped, USPS will NEVER be an option for me as they are the absolute worst shippers I have ever experienced (of course that will vary city to city, but mine is terrible). [Reply] Tom says: February 28, 2015 at 1:32 pm My problem is that for large packages, my local USPS has been claiming “delivery attempted” even though I’m certain this did not happen. Twice in three weeks (original and replacement order) for a large (28 lb bag of dog food) package this has occurred. I was at home both times and there’s no way I (or my dog) missed any doorbell, nor were there any notices. I requested redelivery and the package goes into la la land both times (“delivery status not updated”). IMO this is Amazon’s responsibility. I have to go to the post office to pick it up, I might as well just go to the store. For example, I work for an IT company that provides web hosting services but we outsource to other data centers for the physical hosting. I can’t tell my customers “oh, your site is down, please call the data center”. I take responsibility for the vendors I choose, and Amazon must as well. [Reply] Kyle says: March 4, 2015 at 12:07 pm The business decision Amazon made is one of simple economics (short-sighted, but simple). Of the three major players (UPS, FedEx, and USPS), only one has no shareholders to answer to so that’s the only one willing to lose money on every delivery. Experience with all of these carriers depends, primarily, on the individual people involved (the driver for your route / your mail carrier). If you have a good one (I used to), then you might not even notice that Amazon made that decision. If you have a bad one (I do now), you’ll consider Amazon’s decision to be a bad one. The other difference in the carriers is that you have no recourse with USPS. My USPS carrier frequently scans the package as delivered even though he never even drives down my street (e.g., snow on the ground and no tracks whatsoever). Frequent trips to the PO have only created discord, not solutions. Sometimes my USPS carrier ends up delivering the package in another day or two, sometimes I never get it. Taking it up with the merchant is of no use because the tracking information shows it’s been delivered so I appear to be the liar. I continue to look for online merchants that ship via UPS or FedEx (without handing off to USPS). It’s becoming more and more difficult to find these because – as I stated originally, no one can delivery cheaper than the one who’s willing to lose money on every delivery. [Reply] Nevada says: March 8, 2015 at 12:31 pm Living in rural Nevada, I find USPS services to be the best option for me. USPS does not deliver to my house due to my choice in location, so I head to the Post Office daily. Using a PO Box means I know when I will get my mail and if I have a package a key is left in my box. That key is numbered and used to open a larger package box in the same area. I don’t want things left at the front door of my house. I want them inside dry and safe. Maybe instead of expecting free services from USPS people should purchase the use of a PO Box? There are no lines to pick up mail and it can be convenient. I’ve had really bad experiences with home delivery which included packages being left at the wrong house with Fedex and UPS and Ontrac (being the worst!). However, out of all three UPS is much better in following up with mistakes, but to pick up a package at their shipping department means a 45 min drive (one way) for me! I dislike ordering from companies that use anything but USPS and from my perspective, Amazon made the right choice. [Reply] will says: March 10, 2015 at 10:52 pm USPS leaves packages on the street here. They are too lazy to bring it to the front door. So we’ve had lots of packages disappear. Most frustrating is that we spend a huge some of money on an extra large locked delivery box, and they still are too lazy to open the door (its one way) and place it inside. Maddening.

I threw the pink slip away and waited for it to be returned to Amazon and instead got another gift at the store. The post office is open 9-5 (I’m at work 8-5, an hour away) and then open saturdays 9-1, which meant I either use my sleep-in day to get there early, or suffer the wrath of a dreadfully long and painful wait at the Brooklyn USPS office.

Troy says: March 25, 2015 at 6:15 pm I literally got off the phone with the USPS about this situation. I live in an apartment complex in a small town in the country. I ordered something from Amazon on Monday, with free 2-day Prime shipping. I was home sick today from work – perfect, I’ll be here to receive the package. About an hour ago (3PM), the tracking said “attempted delivery by USPS, notice left” at 9:30AM. What? I was here – no one attempted delivery. Plus, the notice that was left in my mailbox (not until 3:30PM) had the back crossed out – they won’t deliver even if I gave them permission to! Now, I have to wait until Saturday to get to the post office (they are open from 9AM – 5PM Monday – Friday…hmmm, right during my work hours too). To me, that’s laziness on the part of the carrier. Not the first time this has happened, and if I would have known they were using USPS to deliver, I would have spent the extra money and bought it at the store. [Reply] Al Day says: March 26, 2015 at 6:15 pm My experience is just the opposite. USPS delivers to my door while UPS will not deliver at all to my location. Packages delivered by the postal service are usually in better condition than those delivered by UPS when they used to deliver here. So I don’t agree with the synopsis of issues in this article. Amazon now has all their UPS shipments to me going back which tends to piss them off. In time they will just give us a choice or lose our business. All vendors should offer choice so whoever is best where you are can deliver for you. It should never be the vendors choice. I’m willing to pay extra to have FedEx or USPS deliver all my stuff. No more UPS for me. [Reply] Kyle says: April 3, 2015 at 7:46 pm I’ve made over 70 orders from Amazon in the past 6 months, them switching to USPS is a dream come true. I don’t live in an apartment any more, but generally only USPS carriers can easily get into most apartments, which is an enormous plus right there. UPS drivers will often just leave notices without even ringing the bell if it’s not safe for them to throw your packages all the way from the curb to your door. Tampering with legitimate mail is a serious offense, but petty theft if UPS/FedEx; consider the implications for packages that are obviously from Amazon. Finally, I feel like people complain about post offices like they do the DMV – have you ever actually been to one? Mine is huge and beautiful, and there’s rarely much of a line. I know not all of these things will apply to everyone but there’s not much to complain about with regards to the USPS unless you’re a crazy libertarian or something. [Reply] Larry says: April 4, 2015 at 12:16 am I’ve noticed this trend lately myself. I live in an apartment building in NYC and am not always home, but UPS would usually be kind enough to leave my Amazon packages with my neighbors, or at the least attempt re-delivery. USPS? Pink slip for pickup the very first day, without so much as a buzz through the intercom. I’ve missed several packages when I was actually at home because the delivery person wouldn’t take the time to notify me. Then I usually have to wait until the weekend to pick them up, only to be forced to wait in line for 45 minutes. On top of it all the employees at the local post office are rude and sarcastic, and actually raise their voices at the customers. I’ve already started shopping locally to avoid the dreadful post office, or I order items from Amazon that I know will fit inside my mail box (which they don’t always leave in there anyway). And the Amazon Dash button, you’ve got to be kidding me, who in their right mind would wait 45 minutes in line to pick up paper towels when they could spend 5 min for $1 more, or sometimes even pay less? Sure those dollars add up, but so do the 45 min. Would you rather have spent 5 hours and 40 minutes picking up paper towels over the course of a year, or $12?

To be honest, I feel that Amazon’s deal with the USPS has added value to my Prime membership. Sure they might have kinks to workout, but I think it’s a good thing in the long and short run. [Reply] Vandy Reply: April 7th, 2015 at 8:15 pm I’ve noticed many fewer products are being allowed to go to Amazon Lockers, at least in my case. I order lots of business supplies, books, and clothes through Amazon, and stuff that usually goes to a Locker now must come to either my home address or my P.O. box. Fortunately, I already have a P.O. box in my city and I go once a week on Saturday mornings (if I’m in town) when the lines aren’t that long. We have a separate line in my P.O. branch for picking up packages ONLY. Doesn’t mean it’s not a long line, but it’s separate from regular window services. I don’t want to see the USPS go under. It’s an institution that should be allowed to run and I’m 100% against privatization contracts that the capitalists like Obama are proposing and now sticking us with, such as they just signed with Staples. Staples employees are not fit to run a Post Office. But then I’m a communist. Never underestimate the hypocrisy of capitalists, though. They’d sell their own mothers for a quarter.

I cancelled my prime membership and don’t use them anymore since they switched to USPS final leg delivery. USPS is a joke. They don’t deliver packages to my house because it has a long driveway. I’ve met USPS at the street and they hand me a ‘We attempted to deliver your package” notice. To top it off, the notice always says I can pick it up the next day at the post office, but 80% of the time they don’t have it ready so I usually have to wait 2 days after the ‘guaranteed’ delivery date. Also, this is a way for FedEx and UPS to offload costs onto taxpayers. As is usual with corporate-government corruption, profits go up, service goes down. Screw all these hucksters. [Reply] Terie says: April 13, 2015 at 1:36 pm For those of you complaining – I complained too. But, I took my complaints to Amazon and they put in my account to NEVER transfer any of my packages to the post office. Once they made that notation, I have not had any further issues with the 2 day shipping. Nothing is taken to the Post Office anymore. I now have to give that information to all of the companies that are doing this. I hate seeing that my package will be delivered a certain day and then discover it won’t be for another day because it was sent to USPS. Then it takes at least another 2 -3 days. Unacceptable. That is why USPS gets no business! [Reply] Sean says: April 17, 2015 at 5:12 am I would like to say that yes, the postal service has terrible customer service in my city. I worked as a carrier for all of one month after graduation from University, and the structure and idiocy of my local post office made it impossible for any educated or markedly skilled employees to remain there for any amount of time and keep their sanity. My “manager” called me every 10 minutes on my cell phone while I was out making amazon deliveries, causing me to be slower than needed to make these deliveries (yes, to the front porch.) The carriers that I was hired along with tried hard to get the mail delivered on time and correctly, but the constant berating from management to “go faster!!!” resulted in most people either cutting corners or quitting after a couple weeks. The system in place is setup for the idiots to eventually take charge, while the hard workers end up finding more lucrative work elsewhere. This all shows in the service that customers receive from their post office nowadays. I bet most of the people who are now having problems with their mail had no problems 10 years ago, and this is a result of the current system of allowing the inmates to run the asylum. The post office is a case study in what not to do as a company, how not to treat your employees, and how not to treat your customers. It is lunacy and idiocy at its finest and I don’t expect to see it around 10 years from now if they don’t make some serious changes in management. Amazon is backing the wrong horse in the name of profit, but they are only hurting themselves in the long run. The Post office is not capable of keeping it’s promises to Amazon.

I have received packages via USPS before, and I have to leave a note on the mail box to give them permission to leave my bigger packages on my porch. I don’t know if this is the case for any of you, but I’m not sure if they are allowed to leave packages without permission. I have ran into this before and now always leave a note when I am expecting something via USPS so that the post person knows what I want.

There are a couple of times when I thought it would be delivered to my door step but it ended up in my mail box but I have made it a part of my routine to check my mail box. My experience has been a little different, as they still left the bigger boxes outside my door step. Atleast the good part is that Amazon has joined hands with a sinking business and hope this helps USPS employees from losing their jobs. [Reply] miguel says: May 3, 2015 at 9:26 am USPS has time and time again missed my 2day delivery dead line. The tracking always says its out for delivery but never arrives that day. Then they update the tracking saying I wasn’t home but they never left the sticky note on my door which means they never even attempted. Then the post office holds my package for a day and attempts to redeliver the following day. So 2 day delivery turns into 4 day. This is the gunhill road post office in the Bronx. The employees there don’t care about their job and delivering on time. I run a business and use amazon prime as a means of getting my supplies. But without reliable delivery times I’m starting to question if i should find alternative means. When my packages get shipped via FedEx or UPS I never have an issue. But more and more they are using USPS. Bad move amazon. There’s a reason why nobody uses them. Shouldn’t your partnerships be strong ones? This is a step backwards and a bad business move. [Reply] phototristan says: May 6, 2015 at 1:28 am USPS consistently forgets to deliver Amazon packages and never even leaves a notice. I have to manually try tracking it to find out that is at the post office and I have to then go pick it up. Most of the time, the driver just doesn’t feel like delivering the box and it sits in the truck. So many times, I’ve been home only to not receive the package and track it online later only to find out they say ‘attempted delivery, notice left’ to cover their own butt. In reality, they did not attempt any delivery nor did they even leave a notice for me. I’ve also try their online redelivery service with shoddy results. Sometimes, they don’t even redeliver. Last Christmas, they even lost a package from Amazon. USPS has completely flakey service, terrible customer service and no follow through for the actual delivering of shipments!

I wasted a beautiful Saturday stuck at home waiting for this package which was already late, because of course it could not possibly show up more than 24 hrs late (wrong). The last ten packages which I had delivered to work where handed off to my mail room a full 24 hours after the package was marked delivered. I will not be renewing my prime membership if they do not move back to using UPS. Amazon was great and refunded my shipment. Gave me a $5 credit toward a future purchase, and then extended my membership by one month. Highly disappointed in their decision to make a deal with USPS because they are notorious for not delivering mail timely if at all. Disgusted with the way my package was handled. [Reply] Kimberly Neal says: June 5, 2015 at 12:51 am This is an odd piece for a couple of reasons, however , as a carrier I must correct the author by saying “STOP SPREADING HYSTERIA”! Dead Letter pile if you’re not home?! Nonsense! USPS unlike UPS will decipher if it’s safe to leave your package, where we should leave it, who with, and if we are unable, we will leave a notice. We will not just cram it in to your mailbox. We will not just toss it on the porch leaving it in front of God and everybody… Say do you own stock in UPS?! [Reply] Cathee Reply: June 29th, 2015 at 6:44 pm Agree… this article is FULL of idiotic mistakes!! Was this written for the ONION? Pathetic what this guy believes, and ARROGANT to spew his ignorance as truth. [Reply] Michael Jenkins says: June 6, 2015 at 6:09 am The author is spot on. I live in a development where my USPS mail comes to a group of mailboxes. If and only if the item won’t fit in the mail box will USPS deliver to my door. Problem is the mailboxes for the development are in a room that locks at 7pm daily and isn’t open on Sunday’s. What this means for me is that I no longer get my Amazon prime items delivered to my door. And if I can’t make it to the mailroom by 7 (I work 12 hr shifts) I won’t get my prime items for days!!. I asked the postal delivery person to please deliver Amazon items to my house. I got a VERY Stern no, that is what the larger mailboxes are in the mail room. Postmaster said the same thing. No we WON’T deliver to your house. When my prime expires, I won’t be renewing. Amazon has lost my business. [Reply] Tim Scott says: June 16, 2015 at 3:39 pm USPS has entirely stopped delivering parcels to my townhouse. Instead, they place “Attempted Delivery” cards at our mail house. BS! I work from home, and know that delivery was not attempted. After a year of this, I’ve cancelled AMAZON PRIME and will only order online if it’s guaranteed UPS or FedEx. [Reply] bruce says: June 29, 2015 at 8:16 pm I am a Rural Carrier for USPS and UPS and FED_EX leave parcels at the mailbox because they are too lazy to bring them up the steeper driveways. I always bring them up and leave by front door or garage. Maybe instead of calling your carriers idiots or other names offer them a cold water and ask them to leave the parcels by your door. If you get a slip just go online and request redelivery [Reply] John Reply: September 29th, 2015 at 12:39 am Requesting redelivery does nothing. My USPS carrier is refusing to deliver packages he deems too heavy. I know this because of the last package he refused to deliver. I filed a complaint and they fessed up that he said the package was too heavy, but still refused to deliver it. Which is odd, because normal carriers like UPS or FedEx use things like hand carts to move around heavy packages. I also doubt the women at the front desk of the post office are going to move the package around any easier than the postal carrier could. Funny how the front desk staff at the post office have to move the heavy package around, but the actual carrier doesn’t. So on this latest package, Saturday(2 days ago), the carrier lied and claimed there was no secure place to deliver on the delivery slip. Of course I had two USPS packages scheduled for delivery on Saturday. The heavy one was not delivered at around 8am, just the slip was left. The lighter one was delivered around 2 and left on my porch without issue. So much for a lack of a secure location. I filed for redelivery for today and instead of getting my package the status on Amazon updated to “Sorry, your package is delayed because of an issue with the carrier.” Even when the carrier gets called out, they still feel comfortable refusing to deliver packages. Very nice job security, you can’t get fired for refusing to do your job. I know I am never going to see that package from Amazon, it was prime pantry, so maybe Amazon will do something since they want prime pantry to work. Last time they resent the heavy item and laughably it was resent with USPS when Amazon said they would put a note on the order to use a different carrier. But it got delivered on a Sunday and I think they have different people delivering on Sunday, so that time the carrier left it on my porch. With USPS it is simply up to the carrier. Some people have carriers that deliver anything and some people have carriers that refuse to deliver everything. It is hit or miss. I filed a complaint about the fact that the carrier lied by saying there was no secure location, at the very least if the carrier is refusing to deliver because the item is too heavy, they need to put that real reason the delivery slip so Amazon knows it is a carrier issue. It is annoying to have to explain this to Amazon when Amazon’s system is telling them there was no secure location, it makes the customer(me) look bad. USPS should not be lying on these delivery slips. So that is where I am. I can only get light packages from Amazon. If anything is heavy and comes via USPS, there are no guarantees I will get it. My only question is how long will Amazon let me order before they just kick me off despite the fact that they are the ones who chose the carrier? [Reply] Boss Reply: October 8th, 2015 at 9:49 pm Any carrier, regardless of the company they work for should be instantly terminated for refusing to deliver a package. Job description shows up to 70 lbs lifting. If carrier has some sort of disability or restrictions other qualified employee should deliver your package. If your postmaster does not take care of this problem call the Senate. You will see a difference. Shame on anyone out there who works and does not care about customers. You are customer as well and treat people way you want to be treated unless you are real JERK. Sorry but it is what it is! [Reply] jamie says: June 29, 2015 at 9:30 pm I am a letter carrier in a small town. Half of the Amazon packages we deliver are straight off the UPS truck. I asked the driver why and he said residential deliveries arent worth our time. That is the company you want delivering your packages? Also, in my town we deliver straight to your door, no matter how small or large the package. We deliver 100 percent of the Amazon packages everyday in my town. The writer of this article has no knowledge of how the post office works. Dead letter room. The dumbest thing I have ever heard. Do some research. USPS: Cheapest and most reliable. [Reply] matt Reply: July 3rd, 2015 at 5:16 pm Thank you for beating me to this!!! I love how he writes the post office couldn’t survive without Amazon. People don’t realize the post office was forced to payout future employee retirements. What business wouldn’t take a hit when being forced to do that? It is also one of the most reliable companies in the world. [Reply] Nikki says: July 2, 2015 at 5:53 pm My UPS and Fed Ex deliveries are delivered right to the door always. The Post Office hangs everything in a sack swinging off my rural mailbox out on the road. It is over a city block away from my house and they leave stuff there in a plastic bag in the pouring rain or whatever. I can’t even see it’s there plus anyone driving the road can just stop and steal it. A lot of stuff has gotten wet and been ruined. I’m elderly and am unable to walk or drive to my box and have to wait for relatives to pick stuff up for me. It’s very unkind as I’ve known the mailman all his life. Guess he doesn’t care. [Reply] dave Reply: September 22nd, 2015 at 12:51 am Nikki, you can request your mail and packages be delivered to your door because of health reasons. We have folks who are disabled or aged who we will go right up the driveway and deliver to your house everyday. There is a form to be filled out from your postmaster, but when approved we do what is called a dismount, and bring mail to you so you do not have to go to mailbox. Hopefully this helps! [Reply] Boss Reply: October 8th, 2015 at 9:42 pm Nikki, Rural Letter Carrier should never leave box hanging on the post or your mailbox. If you are less than half mile away from the box package should be delivered to your door unless can fit in the box. If your carrier does not care, consumer affair cares. Also, like Tom said get letter from your doctor and all your mail, (not just packages) will and should be delivered to your door. It is called HARDSHIP and can not be denied. [Reply] Tom says: July 3, 2015 at 10:35 pm I am a letter carrier in Spokane, Washington with 28 years experience. In the last year and a half we have seen a huge increase in Amazon packages, and exactly a year ago we started delivering Amazon on Sunday, using temp carriers. Now that nearly every package has a tracking barcode, it has become painful for us to not give good, on-time service, because if we don’t, the supervisor may hear about it on the phone, then the carrier will hear it, and no one likes to hear customer complaints, especially from the people that we serve and interact with every day. Our scanners now upload instantly, and customers can go to the website and track their packages in real time. One of the strengths of the ol’ post office is the national forwarding system. It is not uncommon for someone who has recently moved, to order a package from Amazon or eBay, for example, and forget to give them their new address, resulting in the package going to the postal unit that delivers to their old address. (I see this happen every month.) It takes a few extra days, and there might be a forwarding charge, but it does usually get forwarded, whereas if UPS or FedEx get such a package, they will deliver it erroneously and then will probably get to go pick it up again (if the new people give it back), and return it. I have nothing against UPS or FedEx. They have their respective strengths as well. UPS rates are much higher than USPS rates for packages under ten pounds. There seems to be a large percentage of the public who don’t notice that when they ship via UPS, UPS takes its profit and then farms the package out to USPS to deliver at the lower rate. From the viewpoint of UPS, this looks like a really good deal. From the viewpoint of customers, it does not look like a good deal, or it should not, anyway. The problem with all delivery companies is that they use people to do the work. Not all people care about the customers they serve. I certainly do, and want to give the best service possible every day to everyone on my route. We just heard an inside word that Amazon is about to terminate using FedEx and UPS for the most part and use mostly USPS. This will cause some problems with people who use P.O. boxes for their mail, and it will be interesting to see how this is solved. [Reply] Stephen Walsh says: July 20, 2015 at 1:03 pm I’ve accepted the fact that I will never receive an Amazon package delivered via USPS on a Sunday. My local post office uses the tactic of saying they delivered it in the system so Amazon thinks it was delivered on Sunday, but the package isn’t placed on my doorstep until the following day. [Reply] Melinda Miller says: August 3, 2015 at 8:19 pm To the hardworking dedicated postal workers who have posted, thank-you for your excellent commitment to service. However, I believe it does matter where you live whether you get good USPS service or not. UPS and FedEx have the same issues. If the Postmaster of the local post office don’t care and follow-up issues and complaints, why should the delivery personnel care? There are lazy people in all businesses. You may think people are crazy with some of their complaints of non-delivery but they really do happen exactly the way they say they do. I ordered something for my daughter and it went “out for delivery” never to be seen again. The next thing I mailed noted out for delivery on a Monday and a tag for postage due showed up in her box on Friday, she works from home. A letter posted to her in her state took 5 business days to arrive. She can go 3 days without any mail and then get a large pile. I, on the other hand have excellent mail service. People make the difference in the service, not the organization. [Reply] Lee says: August 9, 2015 at 10:00 pm Well I just got my first taste of the awesome USPS /Amazon partnership! Three different deliveries show as “delivered” to “front porch/door” on the USPS tracking site, but not one package on my porch and I have been home all day doing work around the house, I would have either heard the door or have seen the packages (in fact I believe I was walking my dog right out front at the time!). USPS service has been poor in my area, lots of mis-delivered mail and they have lost two “priority” packages of mine in the last few year. And as others have noted, they are a unaccountable. It’s bad news for Amazon, the biggest reason of all I have been such a huge customer is the shipping. I like the fact you can see the date something will be delivered and know you can count on it. I’m willing pay extra sometimes for a product just so I can have the ease and confidence of shipping. The author is correct, they made a deal with the devil and have destroyed their core competency by teaming up with worst delivery service on earth. [Reply] Randy K says: August 20, 2015 at 11:01 am The USPS is responsible enough to ensure that your package isn’t stolen, and according to this “article” that’s bad for the customer? If the customer leaves a not for the mailman that says “Please leave all packages at back door” or a similar note, then the package will be left there. This was obviously written by a UPS employee that feels threatened. A strong Post Office is good for the American people. UPS has to make a profit to keep their shareholders happy, they don’t care about the customer only the bottom line. For the Post Office, the customer IS the shareholder so they have an incentive to make the customer happy. Does UPS deliver to every house? NO, they only want the high profit stops. How about the Post Office? YES, it’s called “universal service” and is protected by the US constitution. As far as the false statement about the “Dead Letter Office” that’s total B.S., mail only goes there if it cannot be returned to sender because there is not return address on the package. [Reply] Matt says: September 22, 2015 at 10:44 pm I found this thread because of the huge problems I’ve been having with USPS and Amazon. The packages get in a weird place where they never arrive anywhere, they leave Amazon never to be seen again. Fortunately, Amazon has been good and sent the items next-day FedEx (when I ALWAYS get them!) Can’t be cheap for Amazon! In fact, last time, they even comped the item and sent it next day. I think Amazon is starting to see the light. USPS is having problems. My magazines were always a few days late (weekly magazines). Now they are weeks late. Sometimes multiple weeks of a weekly magazine will show up at the same time. [Reply] Boss says: October 8, 2015 at 9:23 pm With respect to all of you, I have to disagree for some of the issues. In Rural America USPS is still best option to get packages whether from Amazon, Ebay, or anyone else in the world. Billions of packages are being processed trough different distribution USPS facilities. Every package dropped to local Post Offices have to be delivered same day. Also Holiday and Sundays delivery are available. Amazon premium packages are delivered by unmarked vehicles mostly rental and these guys are blowing up stop signs and traffic lights like crazy. Worst and dangerous delivery services ever. When it comes to magazines again is distribution facility. If you have problem with USPS you should not post it here; call consumer affair, Congress or Senate Offices and your problem will be solved 100%. No one likes to have bad feedback but Amazon delivery packages are bad for customers not for USPS. USPS is still most trusted federal agency. All USPS employee went to extended background check. Best wishes and better delivery to all of US. [Reply] schnauzer says: October 27, 2015 at 2:44 pm I have a one for all of you. I ordered an item that was supposed to be delivered on Sunday, 10/25/2015. Well, it never made it, but that is par for the course when the USPS is involved. So I waited to see if it would arrive late. Today the USPS truck pulls into our driveway, and the driver TELLS ME she delivered it Sunday, to the WRONG address; then she asks me, if I eventually received it ok. While Amazon isn’t the problem here, the USPS is. I went in and cancelled all my future orders with Amazon, and I will buy from whatever website, or local retailer, where I don’t have to deal with USPS. Imagine that, delivered to WRONG address, the the USPS drivers ASKS ME if I received it ok. Hey – who is the delivery person here, anyway?!

[Reply] Samuel says: December 2, 2015 at 2:24 pm Sorry to hear about your deliveries… I’m a carrier at USPS and I deliver all my packages day-of. And if they aren’t home I will text the customer and ask if it’s ok to leave with a neighbor or on their back porch. I notice the new help we hired really seems to bring back a lot of packages and mark them “dog.” Umm, bro, they don’t have a dog… [Reply] Doug D says: December 4, 2015 at 8:48 pm OK So I go to the Amazon Website, Purposely pay more for an item because it says if you want it tomorrow order within the next 3 hours and pick next day delivery. Pay extra for the delivery and then the next day they show estimated arrival of By 8:00PM. At the same time and on the same page there is no tracking info and they sow it as being in process of shipping. I chat with their rep at 3:00PM and am told the item is on the way and will arrive at 8:00PM (Note: My office closes at 5:00PM) so I wait for the item to arrive. At 8:18 no delivry, no update on the website so I chat with the again and am told it is in the warehouse being prepared for shipment?? I ask when it will arrive and they do not know?? I think Amazon has gotten too big and is forgetting who their customers are and how to treat them. I asked that all of my pending orders be cancelled as I will source my items alsewhere and was told they could only cancel two of five and guess what. The one item I’m waiting for is not one of them??? [Reply] Doug D says: December 4, 2015 at 8:52 pm USPS has made every excuse in the world not to deliver. They lost a printer (obviously it was stolen). They claimed my address did not exist?? When calling the postmaster about the address issue I was told “It was the Amazon Driver” Yes, the special Amazon delivery person that works for the USPS…? I’ve been told of delivery attempts that never happened as you don’t come near my house without my dogs barking. USPS has tried to stick me with Postage Due… Bad Move, Amazon. [Reply] Me says: December 5, 2015 at 11:28 pm This year every freaking UPS package has had issue and been delayed. They got re-scanned and delayed one business day when they showed out for delivery at 6am (NW Houston) all my USPS packages have been early or on time. Every now and then they put small packages in my mailbox. Most the time they drop them at my front door ring or knock at the door. Not sure why you guys are having issues with USPS but it’s services has been better than UPS for me. [Reply] Me Reply: December 7th, 2015 at 10:57 pm UPS just delayed again out for delivery. I was home all day working, they never showed up and went back to the center again. No reason listed, just delayed. UPS is crap. [Reply] Wayne in NC says: December 11, 2015 at 7:12 pm I need to say I have never worked for USPS and neither has any member of my family or any friends. I detested SmartPost and SurePost where UPS or FedEx turned over packages to USPS for delivery because the packages were usually late. Of course, I am an Amazon Prime member and have been since it was introduced. For the last year USPS has delivered almost all of our Amazon packages (there have been over 200). Everyone has been either on time or early. The postal delivery person brings packages to our front door if hey do not fit in our mailbox. They also deliver on Saturday AND Sunday. USPS has been at least as reliable as UPS with our Amazon Prime deliveries. Even large and heavy package are delivered to our front door on time by USPS. I have not been a fan of USPS for many years and I doubt whether the service needs to exist at all. But I must give them credit for their 100% on time delivery of over 200 Amazon Prime packages during the last year. They have also delivered packages from other online store on time 100% of the time. [Reply] JW says: December 12, 2015 at 6:02 pm This situation is also very bad for me as the USPS does not deliver to my address.

Our postal delivery in my area is nearly third-world level. Horrible drivers and delivery people. It’s common for stuff to be delivered very late (5:30pm+) if you’re lucky – on some days, my street gets no mail delivery at all. I for sure am NOT going to be renewing my Prime membership. [Reply] Mark says: December 25, 2015 at 10:49 pm UPS is the worst company and their employees that work in the hubs have worked Sundays for years and been away from their families for years because of the Amazon volume which UPS handles less than adequately both in delivery and the treatment of packages. The best thing for Amazon would be to leave UPS for good! [Reply] Puddy says: December 26, 2015 at 4:32 pm I have stopped using Amazon. I lived on a private road and usps does not travel on private roads. We did get one delivery to our door 2 years ago. The postal lady was complaining because she said usps signed a contract with Amazon that 2 day was 2 day, even on a private road. They must have Un-signed it because I thought it would neat to have some bulk items sent to our door 2 weeks later. I got a slip in our kiosk and had to make a 40 mile round trip to pick up my package. Also, if you notice, in rural areas, postal employees have to use their own cars. They use the smallest and most economical so half the time a big package won’t even fit in their car. And to think the post office used to be great! How the mighty have fallen. Nothing to do with Amazon, but let me say this is Saturday and a Christmas package was mailed to us this past Monday, with 2 other packages, from the same address. 2 packages made it and the 3rd, a box with an Xbox one and $100 Amazon card still shows it sitting 2 states away. It was scanned late Monday evening and seems to have disappeared. [Reply] Cliff Claven says: January 2, 2016 at 6:26 pm I’ve read this entire comment thread, largely siding with USPS workers. They, like our public schools and prisons, have to serve everyone, yet they are maligned and derided without thought given as to how difficult a task that is. However, I was promised an Amazon package today, for delivery to my PO Box. It’s Saturday, and the post office closes at 3PM. The package made it there, but according to the lady at the counter, after the cutoff for distribution to PO Boxes. So my goods will sit in a local post office all day Saturday and Sunday. I can go in and pick them up Monday (but not until after 10AM), 48 hours after I was promised them. My order arriving at the post office and my order arriving in my hands are two very different things to me, but apparently not to Amazon.

Now today tracking states “carrier delay has occurred.” I’m never paying for Prime again. [Reply] wow says: January 21, 2016 at 10:34 pm holy crap.. how unbelievably lazy does this article make you sound. unreal. [Reply] NoPrime NoMore says: January 31, 2016 at 3:10 am Like the author, I loved Prime because of rock solid reliable delivery. My stuff was always where I expected it when I expected it with accurate online tracking. This was especially important to me because I work 100 miles from my home, so I’m only home on the weekends. I could order stuff on Tuesday and be sure it would be on my porch by Friday night when I got home. Similarly, I could order on Thursday and have it be at my “work crash” on Monday or Tuesday. Now, with the weird combination of using USPS directly and allowing UPS and Fedex to drop work on USPS at the last second (“last mile handoff”) the reliability has gone to pot. Tracking will look good, say delivered, and the item was not there. Turns out it was delivered to the post office — 40 mile round trip from the home. The USPS does their best, but they won’t deliver to my doorstep, only to the mailbox out by the highway (1/4 mile away). Anything bigger than a breadbox ends up getting a “attempted” note. Even when delivered, it’s an extra day or two. That extra day often meant an extra work week before I got my stuff. Since this USPS change I feel that the two day shipping commitment was not just broken, it was utterly shattered. I’m sure things are better in the burbs, but in my rural area it’s a dismal development. It’s not because of bad USPS people, the local folks are doing their best. It’s just a bad idea. Prime became so unpredictable that I cancelled it and just used the money to help pay for a spot at a mailbox store near work. I now only order free shipping stuff from Amazon, have it delivered there, and I order a lot less from them. I’m ordering more from their competitors as well. I’m actually mostly OK with that, since more of my money is going to local small business instead of the Seattle yuppie. Still, I miss getting my stuff reliably delivered to my doorstep. All the other prime stuff doesn’t matter when your best connection is sub-1-mbit DSL. Prime was worth it because of the shipping, only the shipping, and always the shipping. Not any more. [Reply] Dean P says: February 11, 2016 at 12:31 am I rarely have problems with FedEx, UPS, or USPS, they are all good around here. Amazon is a different story though, I’m not a Prime member, never have been, never will be. Amazon’s order processing is my complaint, in my experience it slowed down very much from what it was a few years ago. The slowdown was gradual but increased until it seemed like Amazon was just sitting on almost every order for days, then for days and days before getting them processed and out their doors. Finally I just gave up and only use them for research and the very occasional order. eBay has become my go-to shop, I carefully peruse reviews on Amazon then go look up the item on eBay, after checking out seller ratings and such, I order. I usually get free shipping but with no minimum purchase required, and yes, I compare prices with and without shipping costs so I know if I’m getting a better deal or just equal to Amazon. I usually do better on eBay. Mind you, you absolutely HAVE TO check out seller ratings to buy from good people, I don’t like any seller with less than 99% positive, it seems like I have problems with lesser ones. Amazon can take a flying leap at a fast train for all I care. And eBay is starting to have buyer reviews too, not many yet, but it’s coming. [Reply] Daniel Lewis says: March 16, 2016 at 5:31 am The USPS situation is very aggravating. I sure do miss the days UPS would leave the package on my porch if I didn’t happen to be home or get the door in time. Now I, like many other Americans, am faced with the dreaded “Delivery Attempted” Pink Slip. The current mailman, who is supposed to deliver parcels in the morning now comes to our house with his Pink Slips pre-filled out and doesn’t even make an attempt to deliver any package over a certain size/weight determined by him! Well I got tired of it. So tired in fact that I took the morning off on the day that I knew there was a package to arrive. I filmed his deed and the conversation I had about it with him. The recording has been accepted by his boss who also gave me the number for the Postal Inspectors (PI) who he said would be able to handle it with a heavier hand. Apparently postal workers get away with a lot and their immediate supervisors’ chidings go on deaf ears. I’ve complained to the boss a few times and he’s fed up too, thus the PI involvement. You don’t have to put up with the poor service by lazy postal workers. Stand up to the USPS and you’ll be surprised to learn that they are nothing more than another service industry. Granted, it is a lot harder to make a complaint that actually effects change, but postal workers like their jobs, especially in our current economy. If you push hard enough they will come around. [Reply] William` says: March 21, 2016 at 3:35 pm It is no surprise when a notice is received or you look on line and track your item with Amazon displaying that your order was delivered. Anytime you are dealing with the “USPS” it is a big maybe with luck that your order will be delivered on time. Amazon should step up to the plate and let you know that though they promise it’s delivery time of your order on a specific date, once the USPS get’s a hold of it, it becomes only a possibility of being delivered on the date promised. Time and time again at our corporate office individuals come up to me commenting that their order is showing that it was delivered, and I have to go through the tedious process of explaining it is probably hovering somewhere at the US Postal Service Office, and hopefully you will receive it in a day or two. Hey Amazon! stop making promises you have no control over. [Reply] Maria says: April 7, 2016 at 12:10 pm I am considering cancelling my Amazon Prime service due to issues with USPS. I don’t want to pay the Amazon Prime fee just to have to drive to the post office in Kingston, NY to pick my packages up because the carrier who delivers mail to the house is too lazy to get out of her truck. USPS is so unreliable and in this case, incompetent. This carrier even misdelivers other people’s Amazon packages to my house; I can’t even imagine where some of mine have ended up. They scan a package as delivered when the package is not delivered, and Amazon has to pay to replace your shipment. I’d rather pay an extra fee to have my orders shipped by UPS rather than deal with the guessing game of what’s going to happen when I place an order. AMAZON you are NOT saving money if you have to constantly replace people’s orders due to USPS bumbling and fraud, and at some point, your Prime members will go elsewhere. [Reply] Ellen says: May 27, 2016 at 3:47 pm I am having the same frustration. Amazon Prime used to be UPS, and regardless, the USPS in our town used to actually deliver packages to your door. After an incident where a mailman got into a fender bender, the regional office made a policy not to drive up driveways where they would have to back up. They only deliver if you have a large, circular driveway. Never mind that my house is about 10 yards from the mailbox. Now, as others have mentioned, Amazon Prime delivers by USPS, which will only leave a slip, not even load the package on the truck, which results in an at minimum one day delay picking up the package. And you have to take time off work. [Reply] Rick says: June 13, 2016 at 4:51 pm I just discovered last week that I had been changed from UPS to U.S.P.S. for Amazon Prime deliveries. I live in Murphy, NC which is a pretty small town. We moved into our home in late February. I have had approximately 24 deliveries form either UPS or FedEx, ironically sometimes they pull up at the same time but don’t talk to each other! My problem is U.S.P.S. will not deliver any mail to my home. My mailbox is about 6 tenths of a mile from my home at the bottom of a small mountain. There rule is if your mailbox is more than 1/2 mile from your home they will not deliver any parcels to your door. So now, every order I place with Amazon is not even attempted for delivery, they just stick the notice of delivery attempt ( what a joke ) in your mailbox. If you don’t pick up the item the next day it will be returned to Amazon. I have spoken with 2 Amazon CSR’s and 1 Amazon CSR Supervisor. Not one of them claimed to know about this agreement with U.S.P.S. I would surely hate to stop using Amazon, I have been a Prime member since 2007. It looks like Amazon has gotten too big for it’s britches. [Reply] Trent says: June 21, 2016 at 9:16 am The problem I have with USPS is not that I ever have to go to the post office to pick something up (never have, never will–Amazon will refund me before I do). The problem is USPS sucks. And sucks hard. I frequently get mail that belongs to my next-door neighbor. I have to wonder how often my own mail never reaches my own mailbox. Packages? Often, they’re supposed to be delivered, but the USPS driver overlooks it. I know this to be the case because there have been a couple times I’ve been working outside, seen the USPS driver pass my house, then drop a package right before leaving the neighborhood. I’ve also seen “Out for delivery” status change to “Delivered” even when they haven’t delivered it. This means they forgot. So far, I’ve gotten it the next delivery day. And right now, a package that was supposed to be delivered today was misdirected by USPS, and is in the entirely wrong state. No idea when I’ll get it. I get that USPS is cheaper than UPS, but there’s a bloody good reason for that. I’d GLADLY pay extra for UPS, Amazon. [Reply] AROD says: August 6, 2016 at 7:44 pm Management is at fault with most of what goes on in the post office. All they are worried about is the carrier street time and that the carriers should be back by 5:00 PM…atleast in NYC. All they do is rush, rush, rush. They are not concerned about the service some carriers provide. [Reply] Vickie White says: September 5, 2016 at 9:37 pm Wow I am overwhelmed by all the negative responses to USPS sunday and holiday delivery for Amazon. First off I want to comment on the mailbox situation. If you don’t have the very large mailbox that many small and medium packages fit in quit your bitching. Your mail carrier is not responsible for rain, theft or your dog that they cannot tell is a threat by the bark and beware of dog signs that are posted. There is no reason on GOD’S earth you need anything other than a prescription delivered on a Sunday or a holiday. Not to mention that by ordering on line you support other countries economic growth but not America’s. So get off your lazy asses and go to a store and support your community and shop there. No worries then about where your purchases end up or when they arrive at your home. Disgruntled postal worker. [Reply] mark rouse says: September 8, 2016 at 4:12 am I will take USPS over UPS any day. I have never had an item lost or damaged by USPS be it shipping or receiving. Cant say the same thing about UPS. [Reply] Dan Brown says: September 15, 2016 at 9:04 pm I think people are having differing experiences is because the work ethic and morale isn’t constant across the Entire USPS. Some major mail hubs are horrible. They also have different delivery tactics in different areas. One mail carrier will concentrate on just packages, and in more rural areas they will be handled by the regular mail carrier. The USPS is also starting to hire private contractors, especially in more rural areas, not always the best trained or qualified. Also, some mail hubs are better than others. Just track a package coming from NYC through New Jersey, or anything going through Allen Park Michigan. [Reply] Ellen in NH says: September 16, 2016 at 2:49 pm My experiences with USPS is horrible when compared with other carriers who deliver very well. My daughter is in an apartment in Burlington, VT with a suite of mailboxes. There are larger boxes used for packages – when a package arrives, a note is put in the mailbox to look in the package box. Works well except on days when more packages arrive than there are boxes available. Then USPS puts a redelivery notice in the mailbox and expects my daughter to pick up at Post Office – problem is there are two PO’s serving that zip – so yesterday she had two slips for going to two different POs for packages. She fills out the slip to have it redelivered to no avail. Doesn’t happen. There is management office upstairs with locked mailroom. All other carriers drop there and the office delivers. USPS won’t because the package is in daughters name, not Mgmt company (but all other carries do it). I’ve asked for a waiver to sign to say they can be delivered to Mgmt office if boxes are full; USPS won’t do it. Instead they take the package back with them and leave the redelivery slip that starts the cycle over for 3 times and then package returns to sender. Geez – I wonder why people are using USPS less and less – could it be the lack of common sense ? Just have students sign a waiver saying the Mgmt Office is OK to leave parcels at. Heck, Fedex and other companies don’t even need that. It is, after all, a locked mail room. Also – I sent a package to my nephew at Christmas. USPS is supposed to use a security code to put package in secure gated area – if they did, he would have received. They didn’t It was DC area, he never got. But heck, I shipped it express, it was insured, so no worries, right? Wrong. They said I needed to prove they didn’t leave in gated area – they didn’t pay. Really? Is that good customer service? I wish Amazon would allow me to pick a carrier. USPS would not be it. [Reply] Bob Fricker says: September 28, 2016 at 11:18 am Misery… USPS delivers to our community mail boxes with shared parcel (larger) boxes. They put the key to Box “F” in our mail box so we can get the parcel… Key Does Not Work! Can’t seem to catch the mail carrier when she delivers and she can’t see the notes we leave in our mail box it seems. Our items are sitting that parcel box 4 or 5 days now. Neither the USPS or Amazon make it easy to remedy the problem of “Delivered” be a misrepresentation of the facts. If you deliver it to some place that I can’t get to, that is not a proper deliver. I see part of the problem as one of poor customer service. USPS is hard to get help from. Try waiting an hour or more for someone to help you on the phone, for example. Try picking your way through their web site and not being able to find any menu or information that addresses your problem, for hours. I don’t tolerate poor service for long as both entities may soon discover. [Reply] Cindy M says: October 1, 2016 at 1:07 am USPS is refusing to deliver packages to my home. They mark my boxes as Vacation Hold and I have to go to the Post Office, wait 30 minutes in line and carry the box to my car myself. Today I picked up a box that was so damaged they gave it to me inside a big black garbage bag. They refused to ship the item back to the sender. I’m currently waiting for a refund from Amazon. As for the Vacation Hold, the postal worker told my that my letter carrier does not want to carry a heavy box, so he marks it as Vac Hold. That alone is unacceptable, but one of the boxes was small enough to fit in my mail box but he still marked as Vac Hold. UPS and Fed Ex are awesome in my area, simply the best. Since Amazon is using USPS I already canceled all my Auto Shipments and will not be renewing my Prime Membership. I will not be buying anything on Amazon until they stop using USPS. If I have to wait in line and carry the box myself, I’ll just shop at the brick and mortar store, at least they have shopping carts. [Reply] sam says: October 26, 2016 at 7:16 pm Get off your but and go shopping then none of this would be a problem. [Reply] Jeff says: October 30, 2016 at 3:58 pm I stopped using Amazon except for the smallest items that I know will fit into my mailbox. I’m going to get a refund on my Prime Membership too because they are not two days any longer. I’ve spent probably around 40 to $50,000 in 4 years at Amazon. That now is being cut down around 90%. The icing on the cake was, a package has been sitting at the post office since October 6 and the 3 times I went to pick it up, the line was 10+ people with one window open. So, I just notified Amazon to take it back. $150 item. Goodbye Amazon. It was great while it lasted. [Reply] Prime says: November 2, 2016 at 10:10 am I thought it was just me. No wonder why every customer service person I spoke to on Saturday wouldn’t answer my question of “why was my package sent via USPS?” They also didn’t respond to me when they’d say, “thank you for being a Prime Member” and I’d say, “I might not be after today.” I spent 45 minutes on the phone with customer service and had to drive to 2 different post offices to get my package. The post offices were open, but didn’t answer their phones. I brought that up to Amazon and the post offices when I went there in person, and no one would talk to me about that. Glad I found this article…….bye bye Prime. [Reply] Matt says: November 12, 2016 at 11:28 am I never had an issue with FedEX, usually don’t have an issue with UPS, but always have an issue with USPS. Either the package is marked delivered and its not or most times, it gets shipped back to Amazon as Package was undeliverable. I wish Amazon would display under an item that delivery is via USPS, so that I would not order the item to start with.

According to police, a loss prevention officer at the mall’s Walmart was notified of a theft and approached the alleged shoplifter around 11:45 a.m. During an ensuing scuffle, police say, the guard was stabbed twice in his arm. He received medical attention, and police said later in the day that he was “doing OK.” Police then caught up with the alleged attacker and shoplifter on King Street East in Kitchener, near Gateway Park Drive. “We were able to track down the suspect in a vehicle with another accomplice,” said Insp. Michael Haffner. A 22-year-old man was placed under arrest on charges of robbery and assault with a weapon. A woman was also arrested, although it was not clear Monday afternoon if she would be facing any charges. Officers also found the knife believed to have been used in the attack in the car, Haffner said.

(AP) COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) – Whether they shoot BBs, pellets, paintballs or nothing at all, imitation guns can be indistinguishable from the real thing – it’s one reason why some criminals gravitate toward them. Plus they’re cheap and easy to get. As Ohio authorities investigate the fatal police shooting of a 13-year-old boy who officers said pulled a realistic-looking BB gun from his waistband, law enforcement agencies are grappling with the use of fake guns to commit very real crimes. “If I can’t go get a real gun, it’s easier for me to waltz into Wal-Mart or whatever store sells these things and go get a replica. Because if I go to a store to hold it up, the guy behind the counter isn’t going to know it’s not real,” said Geoffrey Alpert, a criminal justice professor at the University of South Carolina. Previous story: Investigation ongoing into fatal police shooting of boy, 13 While the federal government does not track criminals’ use of toy or replica guns, some individual police departments say they’ve noticed an uptick. In Edmonton, Canada, police said imitation guns were involved in 1,598 incidents in 2015 – up 38 percent from a year earlier. In Arlington, Texas, suspects are increasingly using lookalike guns, including an incident earlier this year in which a man carjacked a woman using an air gun that resembled a real pistol, and another case involving a teen who threatened an officer with a replica gun. The officer managed to knock it out of the teen’s hand and tackle him. Arlington police Lt. Christopher Cook said that between March and August, nearly 20 percent of the weapons seized by police after they were used in crimes turned out to be lookalikes. So far, police haven’t had to use deadly force. But Cook said that could change in an instant. “There’s no training in the world that we know of where an officer can readily distinguish a real gun from a fake gun,” he said. “That’s not realistic, because officers have to make split-second decisions to ascertain whether it’s a firearm or not.” A lookalike weapon is at the center of last week’s fatal police shooting of Tyre King in Columbus, Ohio. Previous story: Real or airsoft? Realistic pellet guns trigger similar response from police in crisis situation An officer responding to a report of a $10 armed robbery shot the teen after he pulled out a BB gun that looked “practically identical” to the weapon that police officers use, Columbus police said. A 19-year-old who said he was the boy’s friend told a newspaper that Tyre had a real-looking BB gun, was out to rob someone and ran from police. But an attorney for Tyre’s family has called for an independent investigation, saying the family believes the boy’s involvement in an armed robbery would be “out of character” and the police version of events “might not be true.” However the facts shake loose in Columbus, the use of replica guns in crime has long vexed law enforcement. In the late 1980s, after a rash of high-profile police shootings of suspects carrying toy or lookalike guns, Congress authorized a study that found thousands of robberies and assaults to have been committed with imitation weapons between 1985 and 1989. The study also identified more than 250 cases in which an officer used force – deadly or otherwise – on a suspect brandishing an imitation gun. More recently, Associated Press research found at least 25 deaths involving lookalike guns mistaken by police for actual firearms across the country in the last two decades, dating to the 1994 slaying by a housing police officer of a 13-year-old New York City boy. “It’s horrible, it’s horrible, when these kids are displaying these firearms and a life is lost, and after the fact it turns out it’s not real,” said Allentown, Pennsylvania, police Capt. Richard London. He added it can be nearly impossible to tell an imitation gun from a firearm that shoots real bullets. “It’s human nature to defend yourself in the face of that,” he said. At least 12 states, along with Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, have laws restricting the sale or use of imitation firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, while many cities and towns have their own ordinances on lookalike guns. Federal law requires imitation guns to have orange plugs in the barrel to distinguish them from real firearms, but the tips are easily removed and experts question their effectiveness.

McIntyre September 19, 2016 12:05 pm EST Print Email Tweet Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST) is among the most successful big-box retailers in the United States. It has 117,000 employees and had revenue of $116.1 billion last year. Costco has 501 warehouse stores in the United States and Puerto Rico. Unlike some big-box retailers and other retail giants, Costco charges an annual membership fee to be able to get into its stores. Costco has 85 million members who pay between $55 and $110 a year (plus taxes). The memberships fall into three categories, each with appeal to a different segment of big-box retail consumers. Here’s a look at which ones are suitable for which customers. Two are fairly straight forward. The first is the Business Membership for $55, which appears to be aimed at small businesses. It could be considered an alternative to the Sam’s Club division of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT). This membership allows business owners and affiliates to purchase goods for business, personal and resale use. At the same time, multiple cards can be issued to individuals in the organization for convenience, but at a cost of $55 per card (apart from the second issued card, which is free). The base membership is called Gold Star. Priced the same as the Business Membership, it is specifically geared toward families or individuals. Consumers purchasing goods under this membership are primarily doing so for personal consumption, as opposed to the business membership. A free additional card is available to anyone within the household over the age of 18, which entitles them the merchandise and customer service available to all members. All additional cards after this cost $55 per card. Both memberships allow customers access to Costco gas stations, the hearing aid and optical centers and the pharmacy. Finally, the Executive Membership is twice the cost of the two others at $110. It comes in two flavors: Executive Gold Star and Executive Business. Both of these plans are practically identical to their less expensive counterparts. However, there are a few key differences. First and foremost, there is a membership annual reward of 2% (up to a total of $750) on qualified purchases, as well as additional benefits and greater discounts on products, including Costco Travel.

Employees were told of the closures on Friday and stores will begin liquidation sales by the weekend before being closed for good in December.  Sears Holdings, which owns Sears and Kmart, says the closures are the only way it can 'accelerate its transformation and its return to profitability'. Moody's analysts say Sears and Kmart don't have enough money, or access to cash, to stay in business.  Less than six months after closing the doors on 78 stores nationwide, Kmart announced it will be shuttering 64 more across 28 states Last week, analysts downgraded Sears' liquidity rating, saying the company is losing cash fast and will have either rely on outside funding or start to sell off assets, such as real estate, to sustain operations. In the spring of this year, 78 stores — 68 Kmart units, and 10 Sears stores — were shuttered as part of the drive to stem the bleeding.  That accounts for about five percent of its store base, which is nearly 1,700 stores. The ailing company, based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, said in February that it would accelerate the closing of unprofitable stores following a 'challenging' holiday season. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next German grocery chain that crippled British rivals prepares... Is sugar REALLY that bad for you? The biggest food myths... Share this article Share The stores are slated to close permanently in mid-December and the liquidation sales will begin Thursday 'The decision to close stores is a difficult but necessary step as we take aggressive actions to strengthen our company, fund our transformation and restore Sears Holdings to profitability,' said Edward S. Lampert, chairman and CEO of Sears Holdings in a statement. 'We're focusing on our best members, our best categories, and our best stores as we work to accelerate our transformation.' The closings follow a comprehensive review of the company's locations that took into account store performance and the timing of lease expirations. Sears Holdings has struggled for years with weakening sales, unable to keep up with companies that sell appliances, like Home Depot, or general merchandise, like Wal-Mart, or everything, as is the case with Amazon.com.  SEARS: THE STRUGGLING SUPERSTORE  Sears has a storied history as one of America's oldest department stores, with the formal corporation Sears, Roebuck and Co. starting in 1893. Beginning as a mail-order catalogue, the midwest-based chain opened its first store in Chicago in 1925. Throughout the 20th century, the company tried to expand its reach and brand by teaming with insurance companies and developing their own lines of appliances in order to make the store a one-stop shop for the average American. In the Nineties, the company introduced Sears Grand as the new jumbo store, carrying more varied lines, but that wasn't enough to keep the company independent for long. They merged with Kmart in November 2004, though the two brands were kept as individual units and their stores ran separate operations. The company has been selling assets to raise cash. In 2011, it operated 4,000 stores.  Sears is also shifting away from its focus on running a store network into a member-focused business. Loyal shoppers receive incentives to buy. But those moves haven't gained much traction with shoppers. In the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday shopping season, revenue at stores opened at least a year fell 6.9 percent at Sears, and 7.2 percent at Kmart.  That's a key indicator of a retailer's health because it excludes the volatility from stores that recently opened or closed.  The company saw its fourth-quarter loss widen to $580million, from a $159 million loss a year ago. Sears declined to say how many workers will be affected from the store closures, but it said that an overwhelming majority of the jobs are part-time positions. Eligible associates will receive severance and will have the chance to apply for open positions at area Sears or Kmart stores.  This round of closures comes after 78 Sears and Kmart stores were closed in April and lackluster financial reports through the first two quarters of 2016 KMART CLOSURES - 64 STORES ACROSS 28 STATES  Kmart #3044: Lawton, OK                        Kmart #3180: Merrillville, IN Kmart #3241: Springfield, IL                      Kmart #3320: Houma, LA Kmart #3328: New Lenox, IL                     Kmart #3355: Panama City, FL Kmart #3359: Gardendale, AL                  Kmart #3521: Binghamton, NY Kmart #3556: Elkhart, IN                            Kmart #3594: Chicago, IL Kmart #3644: Nashville, TN                      Kmart #3695: Sierra Vista, AZ Kmart #3706: Wytheville, VA                   Kmart #3754: Martinsville, VA Kmart #3814: Kearney, NE                        Kmart #4066: Jackson, MI Kmart #4095: Joliet, IL                              Kmart #4135: Augusta, GA  Kmart #4162: Salt Lake City, UT              Kmart #4175: Canton, OH Kmart #4176: Cheektowaga, NY             Kmart #4439: Yakima, WA Kmart #4700: Fenton, MI                         Kmart #4717: Oak Ridge, TN Kmart #4739: Clarksville, TN                   Kmart #4772: Burnham, PA Kmart #4781: Macomb, IL                         Kmart #4837: Riverton, WY Kmart #4845: Manistee, MI                       Kmart #4851: Byron Center, MI Kmart #4910: Mentor, OH                         Kmart #4917: Thornton, CO Kmart #4961: Burlington, NC                    Kmart #4970: Memphis, TN Kmart #4972: Lubbock, TX                       Kmart #4984: Tinley Park, IL Kmart #7024: Scottsbluff, NE                  Kmart #7061: New Iberia, LA Kmart #7077: Harlingen, TX                     Kmart #7174: Pikeville, KY Kmart #7205: Grand Rapids, MI              Kmart #7216: Moorhead, MN Kmart #7306: Sioux Falls, SD                  Kmart #7356: Jonesboro, AR Kmart #7412: West Valley City, UT          Kmart #7478: Waipahu, HI Kmart #7551: Indio, CA                              Kmart #7560: Craig, CO Kmart #7587: Fontana, CA                        Kmart #7625: Los Angeles, CA Kmart #7642: Natchez, MS                       Kmart #7718: Hixson, TN Kmart #7733: Alpena, MI                          Kmart #7755: Deming, NM Kmart #7775: Lafayette, IN                       Kmart #7795: Abilene, TXKmart  #9129: Mount Airy, NC                              Kmart #9146: Great Barrington, MA Kmart #9397: West Saint Paul, MN         Kmart #9571: Cullman, AL Kmart #9586: Sault Saint Marie, MI        Kmart #9623: Springdale, AR Kmart #9728: Smyrna, TN                         Kmart #9751: Cody, WY Share or comment on this article e-mail 2.4k shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

 Jet.com uses a shocking amount of packaging for an order of butter Gus Lubin Sep. 19, 2016, 2:08 PM 5,647 facebook linkedin twitter email print Really, Jet.com? Gus Lubin / Business Insider I recently ordered two small boxes of butter to get my cart over $35 to qualify for free shipping on Jet.com. I wouldn’t have done it if I knew they would ship the butter on its own, in a big cardboard box, stuffed with two large, plastic-wrapped insulation pads, 20 feet of paper, and three ice packs. It turns out I'm not alone: Wall Street Journal’s Brian Baskin complained about similarly excessive packaging for his Jet shipment of a single-serve yogurt. Shipping waste is, of course, a much larger problem in the on-demand economy. Indeed, 35 million tons of containerboard were produced in 2014 in the US, reports the New York Times, with e-commerce companies among the fastest-growing users. Still, Jet faces some unique challenges. The Amazon competitor, which launched last year and was acquired by Walmart in August for $3 billion, distributes fresh items through national carriers like Fedex, while Amazon and others use their own vehicles. In short, that means it needs to provide more robust packaging. Jet says it's working on reducing packaging for its Fresh program, which is currently available only in parts of the Northeast. In the near-term, it plans to move to a larger warehouse for Fresh items, allowing more shipping options. It also plans to expand its selection and provide deals to encourage people to make larger orders. The company is experimenting with new shipping options, including coolers that come with return shipping labels, and has recently hired a packaging engineer. "Part of the reason we are being so deliberate about the pilot … is because our goal actually is to scale this pretty quickly," says Liza Landsman, Jet’s chief customer officer. Jet wouldn't comment on how the Walmart acquisition might change things. Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.

Image AP (AP) – Whether they shoot BBs, pellets, paintballs or nothing at all, imitation guns can be indistinguishable from the real thing – it’s one reason why some criminals gravitate toward them. Plus they’re cheap and easy to get. As Ohio authorities investigate the fatal police shooting of a 13-year-old boy who officers said pulled a realistic-looking BB gun from his waistband, law enforcement agencies are grappling with the use of fake guns to commit very real crimes. “If I can’t go get a real gun, it’s easier for me to waltz into Wal-Mart or whatever store sells these things and go get a replica. Because if I go to a store to hold it up, the guy behind the counter isn’t going to know it’s not real,” said Geoffrey Alpert, a criminal justice professor at the University of South Carolina. While the federal government does not track criminals’ use of toy or replica guns, some individual police departments say they’ve noticed an uptick. APD: Man arrested for allegedly pointing BB guns at passing vehicles In Edmonton, Canada, police said imitation guns were involved in 1,598 incidents in 2015 – up 38 percent from a year earlier. In Arlington, Texas, suspects are increasingly using lookalike guns, including an incident earlier this year in which a man carjacked a woman using an air gun that resembled a real pistol, and another case involving a teen who threatened an officer with a replica gun. The officer managed to knock it out of the teen’s hand and tackle him. Arlington police Lt. Christopher Cook said that between March and August, nearly 20 percent of the weapons seized by police after they were used in crimes turned out to be lookalikes. So far, police haven’t had to use deadly force. But Cook said that could change in an instant. Man shot after holding BB gun sues Austin Police Department “There’s no training in the world that we know of where an officer can readily distinguish a real gun from a fake gun,” he said. “That’s not realistic, because officers have to make split-second decisions to ascertain whether it’s a firearm or not.” A lookalike weapon is at the center of last week’s fatal police shooting of Tyre King in Columbus, Ohio. An officer responding to a report of a $10 armed robbery shot the teen after he pulled out a BB gun that looked “practically identical” to the weapon that police officers use, Columbus police said. A 19-year-old who said he was the boy’s friend told a newspaper that Tyre had a real-looking BB gun, was out to rob someone and ran from police. But an attorney for Tyre’s family has called for an independent investigation, saying the family believes the boy’s involvement in an armed robbery would be “out of character” and the police version of events “might not be true.” However the facts shake loose in Columbus, the use of replica guns in crime has long vexed law enforcement. In the late 1980s, after a rash of high-profile police shootings of suspects carrying toy or lookalike guns, Congress authorized a study that found thousands of robberies and assaults to have been committed with imitation weapons between 1985 and 1989. The study also identified more than 250 cases in which an officer used force – deadly or otherwise – on a suspect brandishing an imitation gun. More recently, Associated Press research found at least 25 deaths involving lookalike guns mistaken by police for actual firearms across the country in the last two decades, dating to the 1994 slaying by a housing police officer of a 13-year-old New York City boy. “It’s horrible, it’s horrible, when these kids are displaying these firearms and a life is lost, and after the fact it turns out it’s not real,” said Allentown, Pennsylvania, police Capt. Richard London. But he added it can be nearly impossible to tell an imitation gun from a firearm that shoots real bullets. “It’s human nature to defend yourself in the face of that,” he said. At least 12 states, along with Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, have laws restricting the sale or use of imitation firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, while many cities and towns have their own ordinances on lookalike guns. Federal law requires imitation guns to have orange plugs in the barrel to distinguish them from real firearms, but the tips are easily removed and experts question their effectiveness.

The pipeline spill has even caused Gov. Nathan Deal to sign an executive order banning price gouging at the pump. Even if you're staying close to home, remember these tips to help you save on the cost of gas: Know where to go. Use apps like Gas Buddy to help you find the least expensive gas when you need it. Search your ZIP code to get up-to-the minute information on who has the cheapest gas. » Read more: Where can I buy gas today in Atlanta? Look for deals. Retailers including Wal-Mart and BJ's are known for running promotional discounts on gas. Loyalty programs such as those offered by Kroger and BP, help you save on gas any time by letting you accumulate points you can redeem for gas credits. Kroger offers periodic promotions that help you earn gas credits faster. Pay cash. At my local Shell station, there used to be a sign posted indicating a surcharge for using credit cards at the pump. The signs disappeared, but I'm pretty sure the surcharge didn't. There are no laws on how and when surcharges must be disclosed, which makes it hard to know what you're dealing with. Stations can avoid any issues by offering a "discount" on cash purchases. Get it? Fill up at the right time. Traditionally, it is cheaper to get gas on a weekday morning instead of the weekend or the evening. Prices typcially go up for the weekend on Thursday morning, so fill 'er up on Wednesday for the weekend. Keep your car in shape. You can reduce the amount of gas you burn by keeping up with the proper maintenance on your car. Be sure you have air in your tires, check your alignment regularly and keep excess junk out of your trunk since a heavier car uses more gas. Try alternate transportation. If all else fails, reduce the amount of time you drive. Carpool with friends. Take public transportation. Ride your bike or walk.  Read more: Georgia gas stations: Atlanta gas shortage causes closures How Georgia is trying to prevent a surge in gas prices after pipeline spill Atlanta gas prices rising, pipeline repairs begin Georgia drivers search for gas amid shortages Gas shortages could strike East Coast after pipeline leak This story has been updated.

  Subscribe! | Login | Search Identifying RFID Project Leaders Advocates for the technology come from many different areas within a company and hold a wide variety of titles. By Mark Roberti Tags: Operations, Retail, RFID Channel, Supply Chain PDFEmailPrintDefinitionsSave Article Sep 19, 2016— Our salespeople are often asked for information regarding the titles of our readers. It's a common question all publishers receive, and it makes sense when selling a mature technology. If your company sells, say, storage devices, then you want to reach the most senior person at a firm's IT department to tell him or her why your storage devices are better, less expensive or whatever than your competition's. Alas, this doesn't work with new technologies, such as radio frequency identification. First, if you target a senior person in the IT department, that individual is almost certainly going to reject RFID out of hand, unless his or her CEO has decided RFID is the right thing to do. That's because RFID doesn't benefit IT in any way and it adds work—more boxes on the network to manage, more data to analyze and filter, and more applications to develop. And if things go wrong, it's the IT executive's fault. Targeting senior supply chain, operations or other executives might seem to make sense, and in a few cases, that might be the right person to contact. But more often than not, he or she will have read some negative articles a few years ago about RFID and thus thinks the technology doesn't work. What's more, that individual has other projects that he or she is likely championing, and will almost certainly reject an RFID pitch without doing much serious investigation. Titles are irrelevant. In some companies, such as Macy's, the VP of logistics is leading the effort. At Marks & Spencer, the head of packaging used to run the RFID project (an RFID leader now handles that task). And at Walmart, RFID was driven by the CIO. So that's three retailers with three different functional areas leading their RFID efforts. At our RFID in Health Care event in 2014, we had as a speaker David Rutherford, the nurse manager at Riverside Methodist Hospital. How many salespeople asking about titles are focused on nurse managers? Answer: none. But that was the right person at that hospital to contact. So how do you sell RFID if you can't target by company and title? You focus on the people who "get" RFID and who believe it is the answer to an issue affecting their company's performance. The only way to find people like Carlo Nizam, a talented supply chain executive who understood the value of RFID and pushed it within Airbus (see RFID Special Achievement Award: The Man Who Gave RFID Flight in Aerospace), is to focus on those actively researching solutions. If someone is not actively researching RFID solutions, it is very difficult to convince that person to buy one, since the technology is not an improved version of what he or she already uses—it's a new technology that brings business-process changes and risk. And even if you manage to convince someone you met at a manufacturing conference to use RFID, you'll also have to convince his boss and his boss's boss. It only takes one person within an organization to say "no" for a project to be killed. If you do find a person who "gets" RFID in an organization, you'll then have an advocate within that company who will help sell RFID internally. Even if that person is not high up in the management ranks, he or she understands the problems that RFID can solve and will have credibility internally to push for pilot funding. A project still might be killed as the request for funding goes up the chain of command, but you'll have a much better shot if you have an advocate inside the company pushing for RFID. I receive emails from people with a variety of titles all the time. They are passionate about using RFID to solve their problems and want to know who they can work with. It's too bad that solution providers are often looking for those with higher titles. Mark Roberti is the founder and editor of RFID Journal.

Slideshow Brown Betty Dessert Boutique closing its store, going wholesale Advertisment of Gallery: Facebook icon Twitter icon Pinterest Mail icon After 12 years, Norrinda Brown Hayat and her mother, Linda Hinton Brown, say they plan to close their shop to focus on wholesale opportunities. Chief among them is a partnership with Patti LaBelle and Walmart that has Brown Betty's sweet potato pound cake loafs in more than 500 stores. Hayat, a Washington-based lawyer, and Brown, a retired teacher, opened their first location in 2004 in Liberties Walk, near the current location at 722 N. Second St. Among the bakery's distinctions was coverage in the Oprah Magazine, appearances on the Katie Couric Show and the Food Network with Duff Goldman. Both Food & Wine and National Geographic named theirs among the best cupcakes in America. The Brown Betty Cookbook, published in 2012, provided stories behind some of the shop's hits, including a sweet potato cheesecake and an obscenely delicious bundle of calories in the form of a chocolate ganache layer cake called Hattie Don't Play. The women will sell off small bakery kitchen items plus furniture and accessories on Sept. 24, Sept. 25, and on Oct. 1 from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.  The last pre-order cake/dessert pickups will be on Sep. 25. On closing day, Oct. 1, the whole family - including matriarch/namesake Betty Hinton - will be there.

Vanity Fair hive business technology politics vf summit hwd movies television awards reviews vanities celebrity fashion beauty royals NEWSLETTER Video VF Store Search Business Politics Technology VF Summit Clean Up The Koch Brothers Are Finally Stepping In to Clean Up America’s Mess Email Facebook Twitter SIGN UP FOR NEWSLETTER Clean Up The Koch Brothers Are Finally Stepping In to Clean Up America’s Mess It’s just not the one everyone was expecting. by Emily Jane FoxSeptember 19, 2016 9:15 am Email Facebook Twitter By Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images. With just 50 days remaining until Election Day, Charles and David Koch, the billionaire Republican kingmakers, have some cleaning up to do. Their party nominee flagrantly flouts the conservative establishment they’ve spent years building, not to mention centuries-old democratic norms. And they have a $300 million political war chest to put to use to either stop him or push his campaign into more neutral territory. But that’s not the mess the Koch brothers are focused on with only a few weeks left until the most important political decision of our time. They are, instead, getting into the carpet-cleaning business. Because what could be more pressing at the present moment? According to The Wall Street Journal, Koch Industries is launching Stainmaster, a carpet-cleaner line which first went on sale at Walmart stores in the last few weeks and will roll out nationally this month. The move is the Kochs’ big leap into the $25 billion house-cleaning market in the U.S. Carpets became a natural choice when consumer data showed that Americans considered Stainmaster a top carpet-cleaning brand, despite the fact that Stainmaster had yet to exist. That kind of product slam dunk made it an easy choice to fold into the Koch Industries portfolio. Unlike Stainmaster, Donald Trump_ has been a harder sell. Going into the 2016 election cycle, the Kochs and their massive conservative donor network were expected to raise $900 million, according to The Financial Times but it became clear early on in the primary process that the Kochs wouldn’t be herding their cash behind any of the candidates, least of all Trump. “If they start saying things we think are beneficial overall and will change the trajectory of the country, then that would be good, but we have to believe also they’ll follow through on it, and by and large, candidates don’t do that,” Charles told USA Todaylast November. By January, he told the F.T. that some of Trump’s policies would “destroy our free society.” In April, he told ABC News that it’s “possible” Hillary Clinton_ would make a better president than Trump, and a month later, a spokesperson would not rule out backing the Democratic candidate’s campaign. Now, it appears the Kochs, who spent some $400 million on Mitt Romney and Republican candidates in the 2012 cycle, will likely abstain from presidential politics entirely. Last month, Charles told attendees at a donor retreat in Colorado Springs that he “can’t support either candidate” for the White House, according to Reuters, since his mission is to shore up “the country’s financial future and eliminate corporate welfare. . . . But since it appears that neither presidential candidate is likely to support us in these efforts, we are focused on maximizing the number of principled leaders in the House and Senate who will.” They’ve also thrown $3 million into their Grassroots Leadership Academy, according to The New York Times, a training ground for the next generation of Republicans, who will, like the Kochs, stand against the ideas Trump spews on the campaign trail. “We want a culture shift of people being able to know what they want and how to talk to people in their communities, so that in the future, when there are political leaders that want to demagogue free-market issues, they do hit resistance,” Levi Russell, the director of public affairs for Americans for Prosperity, told the Times. None of this, of course, has slowed the momentum that Trump may be riding straight to the White House. But a brand-new carpet cleaner is coming to stores near you. With that kind of silver lining, it’s hard to say the Koch brothers let America down.

Clearwater, Fla. (PRWEB) September 19, 2016 Many companies in America have been given a bad persona that can usually be traced back to one thing, their lack of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). A study by Cone Communications and Echo Research of 10,000 global consumers found that 91 percent of shoppers worldwide will likely switch to brands that support a social or environmental cause (1). On the other hand, 90 percent of shoppers will boycott a company based off of moral or irresponsible business practices. JoTo PR, an innovative public relations firm in the Tampa Bay area, has found that many company’s PR budget allocations are dramatically changing course by focusing as much as 50 percent of their marketing budgets toward PR to influence people before they buy. In order to accomplish this, many more companies are implementing CSR efforts to fall in line with their reputation strategy. Karla Jo Helms, public relations innovator and veteran CEO of JoTo PR, has been advising her clients since the founding of her PR firm to contribute back towards economic development while also improving the overall quality of the workforce by aiding in social, environmental and ethical concerns. Companies such as SeaWorld can agree that all press is not good press. When the release of the documentary ‘Blackfish’ exposed the cruel treatment of the orca whales within the park, people’s opinion of the business plummeted, and their response towards the documentary didn't help their case. Other companies such as Nestle, Walmart and Chase Bank are not only lacking on the spectrum of their environmental responsibilities, but are also criticized for human rights violations, unethical promotions, financial schemes and more. “Positive publicity and PR will increase the overall success of any CSR being performed simply by creating better word of mouth and getting the news out to the media and ultimately to the public,” stated Helms. “By leveraging your CSR efforts with a proactive PR strategy, the public eye will take notice of the work your company is doing, which studies show heavily influences buying decisions.” There are several industries where this is evident, both through successful and failed CSR. Helms says tech companies understand the importance of CSR and leverage their strategies with PR in order to sway consumer’s interests. With a rise in the field of technology, millennials are a particularly important niche. With 18- to 34-year-olds becoming the largest consumer base in the U.S., the most reputable tech companies such as Microsoft, Google, Apple and Intel, are faring especially well with that age group. These tech companies are listed among the top 10 companies in the world with the best CSR reputations according to a study by the Reputation Institute (2). 42 percent of how people feel about a company is based on their perceptions of the firm’s CSR efforts. (3) In an effort to increase the trust and public perception, companies are strongly encouraged to not only do well, but publicize their CSR activities. It’s a common understanding now that the government cannot be held solely responsible for ethical and societal changes. People believe that businesses have a civic duty to utilize their wealth and success to coincide with strides to improve society by aiding in the growth and wellbeing of society. Helms points out that companies are developing their own CSR departments to solely focus on their sustainable growth. “The tech industry is one that understands the importance of catering to their consumer’s opinions,” said Helms. “Other industries, such as healthcare, are losing the battle to enter into a positive light in the eyes of the public.” One example of this is pharmaceutical companies. Over the last 25 years, they have defrauded federal and state governments by $35 billion, most commonly by marketing drugs for unapproved uses. (4) This turns into a PR nightmare, and gives many pharmaceutical companies a horrible reputation. Positive PR increases return on investment (ROI) for marketing dollars, lowers cost per lead and increases overall revenues for new business by making people more interested and comfortable in doing business with a particular company. (5) “Consumers today – whether B2B or B2C – want to support businesses that make concerted efforts to better their community and the world,” said Helms. “There are now B-corporations requiring companies to contribute to the greater good in their bylaws.” Helms states that companies can no longer reply off of their actions speaking volumes. With today’s cluttered marketing environment, companies have to publicize their good works. “PR creates safe havens of goodwill for businesses today to be able to expand safely by being in control of public opinion.” To learn more about JoTo PR and their strategic efforts to assist in crisis management and CSR to PR correlation, visit http://www.jotopr.com/.

(AP) Whether they shoot BBs, pellets, paintballs or nothing at all, imitation guns can be indistinguishable from the real thing — it's one reason why some criminals gravitate toward them. Plus they're cheap and easy to get. As Ohio authorities investigate the fatal police shooting of a 13-year-old boy who officers said pulled a realistic-looking BB gun from his waistband, law enforcement agencies are grappling with the use of fake guns to commit very real crimes. "If I can't go get a real gun, it's easier for me to waltz into Wal-Mart or whatever store sells these things and go get a replica. Because if I go to a store to hold it up, the guy behind the counter isn't going to know it's not real," said Geoffrey Alpert, a criminal justice professor at the University of South Carolina. While the federal government does not track criminals' use of toy or replica guns, some individual police departments say they've noticed an uptick. In Edmonton, Canada, police said imitation guns were involved in 1,598 incidents in 2015 — up 38 percent from a year earlier. In Arlington, Texas, suspects are increasingly using lookalike guns, including an incident earlier this year in which a man carjacked a woman using an air gun that resembled a real pistol, and another case involving a teen who threatened an officer with a replica gun. The officer managed to knock it out of the teen's hand and tackle him. Arlington police Lt. Christopher Cook said that between March and August, nearly 20 percent of the weapons seized by police after they were used in crimes turned out to be lookalikes. So far, police haven't had to use deadly force. But Cook said that could change in an instant. "There's no training in the world that we know of where an officer can readily distinguish a real gun from a fake gun," he said. "That's not realistic, because officers have to make split-second decisions to ascertain whether it's a firearm or not." A lookalike weapon is at the center of last week's fatal police shooting of Tyre King in Columbus, Ohio. An officer responding to a report of a $10 armed robbery shot the teen after he pulled out a BB gun that looked "practically identical" to the weapon that police officers use, Columbus police said. A 19-year-old who said he was the boy's friend told a newspaper that Tyre had a real-looking BB gun, was out to rob someone and ran from police. But an attorney for Tyre's family has called for an independent investigation, saying the family believes the boy's involvement in an armed robbery would be "out of character" and the police version of events "might not be true." However the facts shake loose in Columbus, the use of replica guns in crime has long vexed law enforcement. In the late 1980s, after a rash of high-profile police shootings of suspects carrying toy or lookalike guns, Congress authorized a study that found thousands of robberies and assaults to have been committed with imitation weapons between 1985 and 1989. The study also identified more than 250 cases in which an officer used force — deadly or otherwise — on a suspect brandishing an imitation gun. More recently, Associated Press research found at least 25 deaths involving lookalike guns mistaken by police for actual firearms across the country in the last two decades, dating to the 1994 slaying by a housing police officer of a 13-year-old New York City boy. "It's horrible, it's horrible, when these kids are displaying these firearms and a life is lost, and after the fact it turns out it's not real," said Allentown, Pennsylvania, police Capt. Richard London. But he added it can be nearly impossible to tell an imitation gun from a firearm that shoots real bullets. "It's human nature to defend yourself in the face of that," he said. At least 12 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have laws restricting the sale or use of imitation firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, while many cities and towns have their own ordinances on lookalike guns. Federal law requires imitation guns to have orange plugs in the barrel to distinguish them from real firearms, but the tips are easily removed and experts question their effectiveness.

Restaurants Home Nation / World Following disasters, how to keep track of tombs print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google 2794815 false William Widmer / The New York Times Recent floods displaced caskets in a cemetery in Denham Springs, Louisiana. Louisiana has begun to advertise itself as a place to figure out how to combat storm surge or how to resettle imperiled communities — or how to keep track of the dead. Click here to enlarge image Editor’s choice Following disasters, how to keep track of tombs By Campbell Robertson / New York Times News Service Published Sep 19, 2016 at 12:02AM DENHAM SPRINGS, La. — On a steamy hot afternoon, Arbie Goings was out looking for the itinerant dead. Goings, a veteran of disaster mortuary work, has been acting for the past few weeks as a “cemetery recovery consultant” here in the part of Louisiana that saw the worst of recent flooding. The cemetery here was certainly in need of recovery: coffins were strewed about, floodwater-filled graves sat empty, and there was no way to tell which coffin went where. What possibly lay in store, as Goings had discovered multiple times over the last decade, were searches through waterlogged funeral home records, wrenching family decisions about the opening of coffins, the dreadful risk of wrong guesses and the prospect that no definite identification could be made at all. But for this macabre and peculiar undertaking, what other system is there? “We’ve talked about bar codes,” said Goings, whose own house had flooded. “Wal-Mart moves billions of boxes with bar codes. It seems to work pretty well.” Catastrophe is the mother of invention, a lesson few other states have had to learn quite as harshly as Louisiana. With an ever-sinking coast and a front-line position for the fiercer hurricanes and other weather threats related to climate change, the state has begun to advertise itself as a disaster laboratory, a place to figure out how to combat storm surge or how to resettle imperiled communities — or how to keep track of the dead. The occurrence of flood-tossed tombs is not a new phenomenon. Searches in the marshes after Hurricane Rita in 2005 turned up vaults that had been missing since Hurricane Audrey in 1957. But it seems to be happening with more frequency here, and, as serious coastal flooding continues to rise, it may begin to happen more frequently elsewhere, too. So Goings and a few others — primarily Ryan Seidemann, an assistant attorney general who is familiar with the vague and complicated laws governing human remains; and Henry Yennie, a senior official at the state Department of Health in charge of tracking the hospitalized, the missing and the dead after disasters — began to informally, but seriously, consider what to do about it. “The three of us met on Hurricane Isaac,” said Seidemann as he sat in his office, a room decorated with a collection of action figures from the film “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and a fake human skull he bought online. “We had all been kind of independently working on these things over the years since Katrina.” Around 1,500 graves were disrupted after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, with granite mausoleums floating away like battleships, as Yennie described it, and coffins scattered for miles. More were disturbed later that year during Rita. It happened again in 2008 during Gustav and Ike. The work was particularly grim after Hurricane Isaac in 2012 because many of the 200 or so coffins that washed up on levees along the Mississippi River were wooden, and had broken apart. During that recovery operation, discussions began. “We realized it’s just going to continue to happen,” Goings said. He was not wrong. This year brought spring floods and, last month, the disastrous flooding across the southern part of the state, unburying hundreds of coffins from about 50 cemeteries. In recent years, Jessica Schexnayder, a retired Louisiana State University researcher, had been to many of these cemeteries. She and a retired LSU anthropologist have been mapping graveyards all over southern Louisiana before coastal sinking, storm surge, erosion or flooding eventually take many of them out to sea. Their work has been used by state officials after previous storms, though some people had thought it not particularly applicable here on the outskirts of Baton Rouge. “When I decided to map the cemeteries in Denham Springs, I got a little pushback because Denham Springs is not coastal,” Schexnayder said. She would reply that the threat to many of these cemeteries was a matter of when, not if. “Now in 2016,” she added, “here’s the ‘when’ moment.” Coroners in southern Louisiana have become adept at matching stray coffins with the emptied graves, an act of detective work that ideally only entails recognition by local funeral homes but can involve opening coffins and looking for some uncommon token — a golf club, a distinctive set of rosary beads, or, in one instance after Isaac, a six-pack of beer. Still, in the small, unregistered and poorly marked graveyards that dot southern Louisiana, identification is sometimes ultimately impossible. The quickest solution would be to bury the dead 6 feet deep. But the practice of interring in aboveground vaults — which has nothing to do with a high water table, despite what the tour guides in New Orleans may say — is a tradition that goes back centuries in Louisiana, one that would not be easily given up. In some places where the Gulf of Mexico is encroaching, grave sites have been covered with concrete to keep them from floating away. Some tombs have been tied down with industrial straps. Still, most graves will not have that kind of hardware, and so, after the floods, the detective work picks up again. After Katrina, the state legislature passed a law requiring all coffins to be tagged with some form of identification, but the law laid out no enforcement mechanisms. Certain coffin models do include a nook for a small glass tube, in which a death certificate can be inserted. But funeral homes often forget to put the information in or, if they do remember, often fill out the forms in ink that smudges easily. So the experiments continue. Earlier this year, Yennie and others in the grave-tracking group glued electronic beacons to a few vaults that were known to be “frequent floaters,” next to an often-flooded bayou outside New Orleans. They worked. But the questions remained of how the beacons would be reliably attached, who would attach them and what would happen when the batteries died. They did the next logical thing. “We built an app,” Yennie said. The idea is to place inconspicuous bar codes on all new coffins and tombs. These codes, as Yennie demonstrated with his phone, could be scanned, and then the app would provide identifying information about who is inside. The concept is in its early stages, he said, but it is promising. It did not come in time for Marie Cain. After the floods, Cain’s daughter went to check on the quiet little cemetery where Cain’s husband, Norman, had been buried a year earlier. “She called me and said, ‘Mama, Daddy’s gone’,” Cain, 66, recalled. The family looked in a nearby trailer park and the surrounding woods, and found about 15 coffins and vaults before finally discovering the one they believed to be his. They drove it back to the cemetery in a pickup truck, covered it with a tarp and placed it next to the empty grave. The coffin did have the little nook to hold the death certificate, but the tube was not in it, Cain said. Still, she is sure they found the right one. Almost completely sure. “I will pop that lid open,” she said, acknowledging the task may be an unhappy one, but that the stakes were high. “I don’t want to be lying next to some old woman or some old man I don’t know for eternity.” 15091002 View next article in Nation & World     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Plus they’re cheap and easy to get. As Ohio authorities investigate the fatal police shooting of a 13-year-old boy who officers said pulled a realistic-looking BB gun from his waistband, law-enforcement agencies are grappling with the use of fake guns to commit very real crimes. “If I can’t go get a real gun, it’s easier for me to waltz into Walmart or whatever store sells these things and go get a replica. Because if I go to a store to hold it up, the guy behind the counter isn’t going to know it’s not real,” said Geoffrey Alpert, a criminal-justice professor at the University of South Carolina. While the federal government does not track criminals’ use of toy or replica guns, some individual police departments say they’ve noticed an uptick. In Edmonton, Canada, police said imitation guns were involved in 1,598 incidents in 2015 – up 38 percent from a year earlier. In Arlington, Texas, suspects are increasingly using lookalike guns. Arlington police Lt. Christopher Cook said that between March and August, nearly 20 percent of the weapons seized by police after they were used in crimes turned out to be lookalikes. So far, police haven’t had to use deadly force. But Cook said that could change in an instant. “There’s no training in the world that we know of where an officer can readily distinguish a real gun from a fake gun,” he said. “That’s not realistic, because officers have to make split-second decisions to ascertain whether it’s a firearm or not.” A lookalike weapon is at the center of last week’s fatal police shooting of Tyre King in Columbus, Ohio. An officer responding to a report of a $10 armed robbery shot the teen after he pulled out a BB gun that looked “practically identical” to the weapon that police officers use, Columbus police said. However the facts shake loose in Columbus, the use of replica guns in crime has long vexed law enforcement. In the late 1980s, after a rash of high-profile police shootings of suspects carrying toy or lookalike guns, Congress authorized a study that found thousands of robberies and assaults to have been committed with imitation weapons between 1985 and 1989. The study also identified more than 250 cases in which an officer used force – deadly or otherwise – on a suspect brandishing an imitation gun. More recently, Associated Press research found at least 25 deaths involving look-alike guns mistaken by police for actual firearms across the country in the last two decades. At least 12 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have laws restricting the sale or use of imitation firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Federal law requires imitation guns to have orange plugs in the barrel to distinguish them from real firearms, but the tips are easily removed and experts question their effectiveness.

Plus they're cheap and easy to get. As Ohio authorities investigate the fatal police shooting of a 13-year-old boy who officers said pulled a realistic-looking BB gun from his waistband, law enforcement agencies are grappling with the use of fake guns to commit very real crimes. "If I can't go get a real gun, it's easier for me to waltz into Wal-Mart or whatever store sells these things and go get a replica. Because if I go to a store to hold it up, the guy behind the counter isn't going to know it's not real," said Geoffrey Alpert, a criminal justice professor at the University of South Carolina. While the federal government does not track criminals' use of toy or replica guns, some individual police departments say they've noticed an uptick. In Edmonton, Canada, police said imitation guns were involved in 1,598 incidents in 2015 — up 38 percent from a year earlier. In Arlington, Texas, suspects are increasingly using lookalike guns, including an incident earlier this year in which a man carjacked a woman using an air gun that resembled a real pistol, and another case involving a teen who threatened an officer with a replica gun. The officer managed to knock it out of the teen's hand and tackle him. Arlington police Lt. Christopher Cook said that between March and August, nearly 20 percent of the weapons seized by police after they were used in crimes turned out to be lookalikes. So far, police haven't had to use deadly force. But Cook said that could change in an instant. "There's no training in the world that we know of where an officer can readily distinguish a real gun from a fake gun," he said. "That's not realistic, because officers have to make split-second decisions to ascertain whether it's a firearm or not." A lookalike weapon is at the center of last week's fatal police shooting of Tyre King in Columbus, Ohio. An officer responding to a report of a $10 armed robbery shot the teen after he pulled out a BB gun that looked "practically identical" to the weapon that police officers use, Columbus police said. A 19-year-old who said he was the boy's friend told a newspaper that Tyre had a real-looking BB gun, was out to rob someone and ran from police. But an attorney for Tyre's family has called for an independent investigation, saying the family believes the boy's involvement in an armed robbery would be "out of character" and the police version of events "might not be true." However the facts shake loose in Columbus, the use of replica guns in crime has long vexed law enforcement. In the late 1980s, after a rash of high-profile police shootings of suspects carrying toy or lookalike guns, Congress authorized a study that found thousands of robberies and assaults to have been committed with imitation weapons between 1985 and 1989. The study also identified more than 250 cases in which an officer used force — deadly or otherwise — on a suspect brandishing an imitation gun. More recently, Associated Press research found at least 25 deaths involving lookalike guns mistaken by police for actual firearms across the country in the last two decades, dating to the 1994 slaying by a housing police officer of a 13-year-old New York City boy. "It's horrible, it's horrible, when these kids are displaying these firearms and a life is lost, and after the fact it turns out it's not real," said Allentown, Pennsylvania, police Capt. Richard London. But he added it can be nearly impossible to tell an imitation gun from a firearm that shoots real bullets. "It's human nature to defend yourself in the face of that," he said. At least 12 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have laws restricting the sale or use of imitation firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, while many cities and towns have their own ordinances on lookalike guns. Federal law requires imitation guns to have orange plugs in the barrel to distinguish them from real firearms, but the tips are easily removed and experts question their effectiveness.

The incidents began when a man, later identified as Fisher, pointed a gun at another driver at around 4:45 p.m. near a Wal-Mart on State Route 30 in Chambersburg. Fisher fled the scene heading East on Lincoln Highway East in his brown 2007 Ford Explorer. State police said he cut other drivers off while fleeing. About an hour later, Mount Holly Springs police started receiving reports of a man driving north on State Route 34 brandishing a gun and threatening motorists in other cars. Police saw the vehicle and its driver parked at the Family Dollar on Route 34 and attempted a traffic stop. Fisher fled the traffic stop, continued to head north on State Route 34, and merged onto Interstate 81. Shortly after Fisher drove onto the interstate state troopers and Carlisle police joined in the pursuit. Moments later, Fisher struck a dump truck heading north on the highway, police said. A state trooper used a tactical maneuver to stop Fisher's vehicle and he was arrested and taken to Carlisle Regional Hospital. After receiving treatment, Fisher was taken to the Cumberland County prison, police said. Mount Holly Springs police said state police have received at least three reports stating that Fisher pointed brandished his gun while on Route 30. Online court records show Fisher is charged with 62 counts including felony counts of fleeing police and illegal possession of a weapon at this time. He is scheduled for a preliminary hearing at 10 a.m. Sept. 28.  PENNLIVE ON SOCIAL MEDIA Facebook Twitter Instagram Pinterest Tumblr Most Read Active Discussions Get 'Today's Front Page' in your inbox This newsletter is sent every morning at 6 a.m. and includes the morning's top stories, a full list of obituaries, links to comics and puzzles and the most recent news, sports and entertainment headlines.

What is this ? X What is this? Sponsored content is written by Global News' without any editorial influence by the sponsor. If you'd like to learn more... - A A + Listen Whether they shoot BBs, pellets, paintballs or nothing at all, imitation guns can be indistinguishable from the real thing – it’s one reason why some criminals gravitate toward them. Plus they’re cheap and easy to get. As Ohio authorities investigate the fatal police shooting of a 13-year-old boy who officers said pulled a realistic-looking BB gun from his waistband, law enforcement agencies are grappling with the use of fake guns to commit very real crimes. “If I can’t go get a real gun, it’s easier for me to waltz into Wal-Mart or whatever store sells these things and go get a replica. Because if I go to a store to hold it up, the guy behind the counter isn’t going to know it’s not real,” said Geoffrey Alpert, a criminal justice professor at the University of South Carolina. READ MORE: 13-year-old Tyree King fatally shot by police in Ohio after pulling out BB gun Story continues below While the federal government does not track criminals’ use of toy or replica guns, some individual police departments say they’ve noticed an uptick. In Edmonton, Canada, police said imitation guns were involved in 1,598 incidents in 2015 – up 38 per cent from a year earlier. In Arlington, Texas, suspects are increasingly using lookalike guns, including an incident earlier this year in which a man carjacked a woman using an air gun that resembled a real pistol, and another case involving a teen who threatened an officer with a replica gun. The officer managed to knock it out of the teen’s hand and tackle him. READ MORE: 911 caller could face charges after man with BB gun shot dead by police Arlington police Lt. Christopher Cook said that between March and August, nearly 20 per cent of the weapons seized by police after they were used in crimes turned out to be lookalikes. So far, police haven’t had to use deadly force. But Cook said that could change in an instant. “There’s no training in the world that we know of where an officer can readily distinguish a real gun from a fake gun,” he said. “That’s not realistic, because officers have to make split-second decisions to ascertain whether it’s a firearm or not.” A lookalike weapon is at the centre of last week’s fatal police shooting of Tyre King in Columbus, Ohio. READ MORE: Prince Albert police say man threatening people with BB gun arrested (Feb 2016) An officer responding to a report of a $10 armed robbery shot the teen after he pulled out a BB gun that looked “practically identical” to the weapon that police officers use, Columbus police said. A 19-year-old who said he was the boy’s friend told a newspaper that Tyre had a real-looking BB gun, was out to rob someone and ran from police. But an attorney for Tyre’s family has called for an independent investigation, saying the family believes the boy’s involvement in an armed robbery would be “out of character” and the police version of events “might not be true.” However the facts shake loose in Columbus, the use of replica guns in crime has long vexed law enforcement. In the late 1980s, after a rash of high-profile police shootings of suspects carrying toy or lookalike guns, Congress authorized a study that found thousands of robberies and assaults to have been committed with imitation weapons between 1985 and 1989. The study also identified more than 250 cases in which an officer used force – deadly or otherwise – on a suspect brandishing an imitation gun. More recently, Associated Press research found at least 25 deaths involving lookalike guns mistaken by police for actual firearms across the country in the last two decades, dating to the 1994 slaying by a housing police officer of a 13-year-old New York City boy. “It’s horrible, it’s horrible, when these kids are displaying these firearms and a life is lost, and after the fact it turns out it’s not real,” said Allentown, Pennsylvania, police Capt. Richard London. But he added it can be nearly impossible to tell an imitation gun from a firearm that shoots real bullets. “It’s human nature to defend yourself in the face of that,” he said. At least 12 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have laws restricting the sale or use of imitation firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, while many cities and towns have their own ordinances on lookalike guns. Federal law requires imitation guns to have orange plugs in the barrel to distinguish them from real firearms, but the tips are easily removed and experts question their effectiveness. — Associated Press researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this story. © 2016 The Canadian Press Report an error 13-year-old killed in ohio BB Gun boy with bb gun kille columbus ohio shooting columbus shooting fake gun Editor's Picks Consumer How Trump's immigration crackdown could raise food prices for Canadians Politics Trudeau Liberals ‘trampling’ on women’s rights with new CPP regime: opposition Money Here's how much mortgage payments will go up as banks hike rates Consumer Text message fraud cost Canadians half a million dollars so far in 2016 Investigations Ontario schools are missing ‘perfect opportunity’ to address mental health amid rash of youth suicides Health Drugs aren’t tested on women like they are on men, and it could have deadly consequences Investigations How mental health should be taught in Canadian schools FLYERS More Weekly Flyers Comments Popular Now Jon Stewart slams 'hypocrisy' of labelling all Donald Trump voters racist 9703 Earth on track to heat up to devastating levels by 2100, scientists say 8561 WATCH: Polar bear seen petting sled dog near Churchill, Manitoba 8270 Father sentenced to 40 years in jail for killing his daughter’s sexual abuser 7786 How the ‘mystery shopper’ scam fooled a young mother, a factory worker and a senior 5763 Sponsored content Popular Videos Mystery shopping texts sent to Canadians turn out to be scam WATCH NOW Man dies after falling into acidic hot spring in Yellowstone National Park WATCH NOW MPs Michelle Rempel and Elizabeth May argue over the use of the word ‘fart’ in House of Commons WATCH NOW Love and loss, a Saskatoon couple shares their NICU story WATCH NOW Jon Gosselin says Kate Gosselin ‘won’t tell’ where their son Collin is WATCH NOW Jump to a Region BC Calgary Edmonton Halifax Lethbridge Montreal New Brunswick Okanagan Regina Saskatoon Toronto Winnipeg Connect Facebook Twitter Google+ Instagram LinkedIn Tumblr Pinterest RSS Contact Us Global News About Us Privacy Policy Principles & Practices Terms & Conditions Copyright Corus Entertainment Advertise Branded Content Open Data © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Best looking Dallas parade ever. Faux pas: Southwest Airlines was immediately followed by American Airlines. Interesting: Walmart Pride participated but Chik-fil-A Pride didn’t. That’s a thing, right? Dallas Police: Friendly. Enthusiastic. Had fun while keeping a careful eye on everything going on from rooftops to street. I spoke to a number of them and they’re the best. Parade participants made sure any officer who needed water got it. I saw lots of hugs for officers while they remained vigilant making sure we were safe. I’ve never seen a community and police force love and respect each other during a large event as much as I saw today. And I can compare. Last year I was at Houston Pride. Not a single smile. They weren’t there to answer a question and not one that I encountered on the entire parade route wanted to be there. Believe me. There weren’t hugs with Houston police.

As ... more Photo: Mark Duncan Fake gun, real crime: Police notice uptick in replicas 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Whether they shoot BBs, pellets, paintballs or nothing at all, imitation guns can be indistinguishable from the real thing — it's one reason why some criminals gravitate toward them. Plus they're cheap and easy to get. As Ohio authorities investigate the fatal police shooting of a 13-year-old boy who officers said pulled a realistic-looking BB gun from his waistband, law enforcement agencies are grappling with the use of fake guns to commit very real crimes. "If I can't go get a real gun, it's easier for me to waltz into Wal-Mart or whatever store sells these things and go get a replica. Because if I go to a store to hold it up, the guy behind the counter isn't going to know it's not real," said Geoffrey Alpert, a criminal justice professor at the University of South Carolina. While the federal government does not track criminals' use of toy or replica guns, some individual police departments say they've noticed an uptick. In Edmonton, Canada, police said imitation guns were involved in 1,598 incidents in 2015 — up 38 percent from a year earlier. In Arlington, Texas, suspects are increasingly using lookalike guns, including an incident earlier this year in which a man carjacked a woman using an air gun that resembled a real pistol, and another case involving a teen who threatened an officer with a replica gun. The officer managed to knock it out of the teen's hand and tackle him. Arlington police Lt. Christopher Cook said that between March and August, nearly 20 percent of the weapons seized by police after they were used in crimes turned out to be lookalikes. So far, police haven't had to use deadly force. But Cook said that could change in an instant. "There's no training in the world that we know of where an officer can readily distinguish a real gun from a fake gun," he said. "That's not realistic, because officers have to make split-second decisions to ascertain whether it's a firearm or not." A lookalike weapon is at the center of last week's fatal police shooting of Tyre King in Columbus, Ohio. An officer responding to a report of a $10 armed robbery shot the teen after he pulled out a BB gun that looked "practically identical" to the weapon that police officers use, Columbus police said. A 19-year-old who said he was the boy's friend told a newspaper that Tyre had a real-looking BB gun, was out to rob someone and ran from police. But an attorney for Tyre's family has called for an independent investigation, saying the family believes the boy's involvement in an armed robbery would be "out of character" and the police version of events "might not be true." However the facts shake loose in Columbus, the use of replica guns in crime has long vexed law enforcement. In the late 1980s, after a rash of high-profile police shootings of suspects carrying toy or lookalike guns, Congress authorized a study that found thousands of robberies and assaults to have been committed with imitation weapons between 1985 and 1989. The study also identified more than 250 cases in which an officer used force — deadly or otherwise — on a suspect brandishing an imitation gun. More recently, Associated Press research found at least 25 deaths involving lookalike guns mistaken by police for actual firearms across the country in the last two decades, dating to the 1994 slaying by a housing police officer of a 13-year-old New York City boy. "It's horrible, it's horrible, when these kids are displaying these firearms and a life is lost, and after the fact it turns out it's not real," said Allentown, Pennsylvania, police Capt. Richard London. But he added it can be nearly impossible to tell an imitation gun from a firearm that shoots real bullets. "It's human nature to defend yourself in the face of that," he said. At least 12 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico have laws restricting the sale or use of imitation firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, while many cities and towns have their own ordinances on lookalike guns. Federal law requires imitation guns to have orange plugs in the barrel to distinguish them from real firearms, but the tips are easily removed and experts question their effectiveness. ——— Associated Press researcher Rhonda Shafner in New York contributed to this story.

Valerie Tieman, 34, was last seen with her husband Luc Tieman on Aug. 30 at a Wal-Mart parking lot.  The couple had parked in a red pickup truck. Luc Tieman then went into the store while Valerie remained in the car, but when he returned, she was missing. Two weeks after the incident, Valerie’s parents residing in South Carolina reported her missing to Fairfield police on Sep 16. As to why Luc waited to report the incident, Maine State Police spokesman Steve McCausland said, “I don’t have an explanation as to his inaction,” reports WABI-TV. McCausland added that police will be investigating the Walmart surveillance camera and financial records, as well as talking to Valerie’s friends and family. Luc Tieman also told the Morning Sentinel that his wife had “run off” before, though he didn’t provide additional details. Valerie Tieman is being described by police as 5 foot 7, 165 pounds, and with short brown hair and eyes. Anyone with information on the whereabouts of Tieman are asked to call state police in Augusta at 624-7076 or the Fairfield police.

PETERSBURG, Fla.-- Yes, that's a real headline, and this actually happened.  On Saturday, the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office held its annual Operation Safe Surrender. PCSO partners with the courts to allow people with outstanding non-violent misdemeanor warrants to safely turn themselves in and have their warrants reviewed. RELATED STORY: Operation Safe Surrender - 38 misdemeanor warrants processed, purged That helps potentially resolve the case instead of there being an arrest. But, listen to this. There was a moment in court that stopped the judge in his tracks. A woman pleading guilty for stealing a cart of merchandise from Walmart shared her interesting plan to turn her life around. Here's how the conversation went:  Judge: “Do you work?” Defendant: “I’m looking for [work], I have an interview. I’m waiting for Walmart to call me back at Pinellas Park. I have an interview with them.” Judge: “I’m on candid camera aren’t I?” “How do you think it’s gonna go when the background shows that you tried to take a cart full of stuff from -- well -- Walmart?” “A lot of times, that’d be a disqualifier. What do I know? There, I’m over it.”  That prompted some laughs from the judge, staff members and even the bailiffs. But, all jokes aside, the court collected $1,113 in fees and fines. No arrests were made during the event.  CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Texans players given warnings ahead of Mexico game High speed chase ends with deadly crash Ex-teacher pleads guilty to sexually assaulting student Houston Forecast for Friday morning Family that returned husky is given new dog 21-year-old Carl Conyers found safe Brutal new details in teen's murder Search continues for missing UH student Check before renting out home for Super Bowl Representative's son missing More Stories Mother: Missing UH student, Congressman's son found safe Nov 18, 2016, 4:51 a.m. Woman dies after car slams into pole, splitting it in half Nov 18, 2016, 5:33 a.m. Donald Trump offers Jeff Sessions attorney general post Nov 18, 2016, 6:18 a.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather Health Detail Closings & Delays Location Search Radars Conditions Hurricane Central More...

Tampa Bay Times: Subscribe Make Payment/Renew Missed Paper Vacation Stop E-Paper TBO: Advertise Contact Us AUTOS HOMES JOBS Friday, Nov 18, 2016 73° Home Local News US & World Sports Entertainment Radar Weather Special Sections Politics Trump connects with fed-up folks in Pasco County By ADAM C. SMITH Times political editor Published: September 18, 2016 HOLIDAY — Donald Trump’s prospects for winning the White House will probably rise or fall among the strip malls and 1,000-square-foot ranch homes of southwest Pasco County. In this working-class suburb of Tampa Bay, finding people enthusiastically supporting Hillary Clinton is tough. Finding people enthusiastically supporting Trump is less difficult. Finding people fed up with the status quo is a piece of cake. “It’s not that I like Trump that much, it’s that I dislike Hillary so much. I don’t think (Barack) Obama did anything for us, and I see it continuing with Hillary. At least with Trump, there’s a chance for some change, and I’m all for change,” said 66-year-old retiree Ken Seekford, plunging into a bowl of soup at Jimmy’s Restaurant in downtown New Port Richey. A lifelong Democrat who moved to Pasco from Maryland two years ago, Seekford is so turned off by Clinton that he switched his registration to Republican after watching the Democratic National Convention. “Look at everything she was caught in,” he said. “With those emails, somebody asks her, ‘Did you wipe your hard drive?’ And she says, ‘What do you mean, with a rag?’ Come on, she’s smarter than that.” Trump can’t win the presidency without winning Florida, and many observers question how he can win Florida if he fails to do better among Florida’s one in three minority voters. That’s not expected to happen. So how is it that poll after poll shows Trump running neck-and-neck with Clinton, with a real shot at winning Florida’s 29 electoral votes? The answer lies behind the Advanced Auto Parts and Big Lots stores along U.S. 19, in 40-year-old subdivisions with names like Holiday Lakes Estates, Beacon Square and Regency Park. Those who divide Florida into political territories call this corner of Pasco County Florida House District 36. And unlike the vast majority of legislative districts across America, the roughly 100,000 voters here tend to be independent-minded and unpredictable. Thirty-five percent are registered Republicans, 34 percent Democrats and 31 percent belong to neither party. In 2008 and in 2012, Obama narrowly carried Florida House District 36, and narrowly won Florida. But a poll of likely voters taken in July by a Democratic polling firm found Trump with a double-digit lead over Clinton — 51 percent to 39 percent — in this district. • • • Southwest Pasco County looks tailor-made for Trump: 90 percent white, nearly 90 percent without college degrees, median household income of about $34,000. Also, widespread anxiety over crime and a deteriorating quality of life. In the 1970s, this was a blue-collar retirement mecca that attracted Northeasterners who could buy a comfortable two-bedroom ranch with attached garage for $10,000. Many of these same homes sold for more than $140,000 during the peak of the housing bubble in 2006, only to see their values plummet to less than $50,000 today. The numbers help explain how Trump is defying the conventional political wisdom that Florida’s fast-changing demographics will make the state a steep climb for a Republican nominee so weak among minority voters. That conventional wisdom also may underestimate Clinton’s unpopularity based on conversations inside the VFW post, outside the Walmart and inside Jimmy’s Restaurant. “She should be in jail, and you or me would be if we did what she did with those emails,” said Dorothy Jay of Holiday over lunch at Jimmy’s with her husband. “At least Trump is not going to be taking payoffs from people wanting something.” “I don’t trust her, and we don’t need another four years of Obama,” said Alan Jay, who moved with his wife to the area from Long Island in 1994. “Trump’s problem is that he has diarrhea of the mouth. He speaks before he thinks, but what comes out of his mouth is honest.” Republican pollster Wes Anderson, who works for the Rebuilding America Now super PAC helping Trump, said Clinton has at least as much to do with Trump’s strength in Florida as Trump. “Everyone talks about Trump’s negatives, and we kind of miss the point that Hillary Clinton has just as strong negatives as he does — and in some ways hers are more telling,” Anderson said. “This is a change election, and she is anything but that. Whether she likes it or not, she wears the mantle of the political establishment. ... That is actually what’s happening in Florida.” Even as Clinton dramatically outspends Trump on TV ads in Florida and builds a more robust voter-turnout operation, the candidates are virtually tied. The average of recent Florida polls compiled by RealClearPolitics.com on Friday had Trump with 45.1 percent support and Clinton with 44.4 percent. “The assumption is it’s because Trump is running up the score in the markets where Republicans have to run up the score when they win Florida,” said Anderson. “I think that’s only half of the story. There are lots of places where she is underperforming, and I do think it’s going to come down to Tampa and Orlando.” Candidates and political operatives in competitive legislative races in Hillsborough and Pinellas counties say they see Trump running much stronger than expected. Democratic state Rep. Amanda Murphy represents District 36 and keeps her distance from Clinton while knocking on doors or talking with residents, many of whom recently experienced severe flooding from Hurricane Hermine. She said she understands the sentiments of Trump backers she encounters. “People do want change, and I understand that,” said Murphy, who stresses to people that she is not a lifelong politician and is focused on Tallahassee, not Washington. The district used to be represented by Republican Mike Fasano, now Pasco’s tax collector, who said he hears plenty of anecdotal evidence about Trump’s strength. “I don’t know that they are as much in love with Donald Trump as they are disgusted with the whole process, and they have been disgusted by it for years,” Fasano said. “People are just tired of the old regimes in Washington, whether it be Republicans or Democrats, and whether it’s Mitch McConnell or John Boehner or Hillary Clinton. They’re just tired of it. They feel understandably like they’re not being told the truth, and they’re tired of being pushed aside.” Even if Trump wins this district comfortably, he could lose Florida. Charlie Crist, the populist Republican-turned-Democratic candidate for governor, beat Rick Scott by 10 percentage points here in 2014 but still lost narrowly statewide. • • • Four years ago, Mitt Romney lost this district to Obama by 2,404 votes, or nearly 4 percentage points. But this year’s super wealthy Republican nominee is connecting far better with the blue-collar voters of Pasco than 2012’s super wealthy nominee. Among the transplanted Northeasterners, Trump is more Queens than Wall Street. “Trump works with laborers and goes up and pats them on the back. Hillary doesn’t do that,” said Seekford, sitting at Jimmy’s. “Hillary doesn’t even want to touch a commoner. It might rub off on her.” At Jimmy’s with his wife, 84-year-old Democrat Joe Trumbauer talked about how tough it is caring for his wife with Alzheimer’s because he can’t afford help. He’s a loyal Democrat, a former Mack Truck auto worker from Allentown, Pa., but is intrigued by Trump. “We didn’t get a Social Security raise in the last two or three years — and that’s Democrats in the White House,” Trumbauer said. “I do in a way want to vote for Trump, but I’m afraid to because I don’t know what he’s going to do.” Even Clinton supporters in the area sounded sheepish about supporting her. Inside Randolph Ford VFW Post 7845 in Port Richey, where most of the boisterous men and women at the bar said they liked Trump, retired Air Force veteran John Rodgers, 80, said Clinton supporters like himself tend to be more low-key. “It’s because she’s been in politics for so long,’’ Rodgers said. “It’s hard to get excited about and trust someone who’s been in politics so long.” Contact Adam Smith at asmith@tampabay.com.

By Michael Purdy Sand Springs, Okla. — A 19-year-old driver was tracked down Saturday morning, after allegedly hitting a bicyclist with his vehicle.   The incident happened in front of a Walmart on Morrow Road.   Sand Springs police say Gary Day didn't stick around the scene.  Instead, he left the area with an unidentified passenger.   However, Day didn't get very far.  "Ofc. Barnett activated his emergency lights and conducted a traffic stop with the suspect vehicle, which turned south onto 113th West Avenue and pulled into a parking lot at 3810 South 113th West Avenue," police said.   Once in custody, Gary Day confessed to drinking the night before and taking "some pills." No word on if the passenger was arrested.  We do know he was chatty with officers. "That (passenger) was scared he would get into trouble because he is on probation, so he told Gary to leave," police said.  "Gary then left to take (passenger) to his mother." Day was eventually booked into the Tulsa County Jail.   [Information from arrest and booking report] There are no comments yet. Be the first to post your thoughts.

While there were trades, and insiders were making some moves, the volume was dwarfed by insider buying, and in a volatile market that is a good sign for long-term investors. With third-quarter earnings only a couple of weeks away, windows for insiders may be starting to close up. We cover insider selling every week at 24/7 Wall St., and we like to remind readers that just because an individual or 10% institutional owner sells stock, that is no cause for immediate alarm. Many top executives, and even directors, are compensated with stock and often sell just to diversify portfolios or purchase other assets. Here are companies that reported notable insider selling last week. Wal-Mart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) had a member of the founding family of the company selling a massive chunk of the stock for the second week in a row. Rob Walton, who is a 10% owner and a director at the retail giant, sold a total of 2.1 million shares of the stock at prices that ranged from $70.57 to $71.97 apiece. The total for the sale was posted at an incredible $150 million. The stock closed trading last Friday at $72.87, so some was definitely left on the table. Charter Communications Inc.‘s (NASDAQ: CHTR) president sold stock last week. John Bickham parted with a total of 36,825 shares of the media giant at prices between $256.73 and $257.13. The total for the sale was $10 million. The company offers various entertainment, information, and communications solutions to residential and commercial customers. Shares ended the day last Friday at $265.94, so a good chunk was left on the table. UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE: UNH) had a director at the company selling shares last week. That director sold a block of 40,000 shares at prices that ranged from $134.90 to $135.80 per share. The total for the sale was posted at $5 million. Shares closed on Friday at $138.47, well above the director’s selling price. Commerce Bancshares Inc. (NASDAQ: CBSH) had a vice chairman parting with stock last week. Some 50,000 shares of the stock were sold at prices that ranged from $50.00 to $50.24. The total for the sale was posted at $3 million. Commerce Bancshares operates as the bank holding company for Commerce Bank. Its stock closed Friday at $48.73 a share, so the timing looks solid. Paycom Software Inc.‘s (NYSE: PAYC) chief information officer thinned his stake last week. William Kerber sold 55,000 shares at prices between $52.00 and $52.29. That netted him $3 million. Paycom Software provides cloud-based human capital management software solutions for small to mid-sized companies in the United States. The stock closed Friday at $48.56, so some very good timing for this sale. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   These companies also reported insider selling last week: Acadia Healthcare Co. Inc. (NASDAQ: ACHC), Argan Inc. (NYSE: AGX), MSCI Inc. (NYSE: MSCI) and United Rentals Inc. (NYSE: URI). The decidedly lower volume comes on the heels of recent weeks that saw huge selling, and again the slowdown may be related to insider windows shutting for earnings season, However that certainly wasn’t the case with insider buying.

An increasing number of investors are looking at more than just financial statements to pick investments. Should you join the growing crowd looking to do well by doing good? Jordan Wathen (TMFValueMagnet) Sep 18, 2016 at 2:27PM Photo by: Getty Images. One of the hottest trends in asset management today is socially responsible investing, sometimes referred to as ethical investing. Socially responsible funds, which include 150 mutual funds and index funds, managed more than $135 billion in assets early in 2016. Some managers, most notably, Trillium, specialize in this strategy. What's popular isn't necessarily what's good for your portfolio, however. What is socially responsible investing? The definition of socially responsible investing depends largely on who you ask, though the strategy is perhaps best defined by what it excludes rather than what it includes. The category's largest funds avoid investments in particular industries that fail tests for social responsibility. One of the largest and most successful funds in the category, the Parnassus Core Equity Fund (NASDAQMUTFUND:PRBLX), specifically avoids companies that generate a significant portion of their revenue from alcohol, tobacco, weapons, nuclear power, gambling, fossil fuels, or from operations in the country of Sudan.   Todd Ahlsten, one of two of Parnassus Core Equity Fund's portfolio managers, once said in an interview that selecting which stocks to avoid for reasons of social responsibility is "a judgement call." He explained that the fund won't invest in Coca-Cola because fund management doesn't "think it's necessarily a healthy product for society." Similarly, the fund has avoided investing in Wal-Mart, because it sees the company as "destroying the downtown areas of Middle America." Neither of these companies would otherwise be left out from the fund by less subjective criteria listed in the fund's prospectus, which simply names industries and geographies it generally avoids investing in.  Vanguard's FTSE Social Index Fund (NASDAQMUTFUND:VFTSX) roughly matches the Parnassus fund's omissions, adding adult entertainment as a revenue source that can lead to a company's exclusion from its fund. Where most such funds aim to avoid particular industries that do not get the green light for social responsibility, other smaller funds make a concentrated effort to invest in companies that exhibit particular ideologies or characteristics. The recently launched SDPR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF specifically invests in companies with a high ratio of women to men at the executive level, giving extra weight to gender diversity on boards of directors. The fund advisor even goes so far to state that it intends to make charitable contributions to organizations that "seek to enhance gender equity through educational efforts," noting that these contributions will be benchmarked to the size of the fund. In an interview with the New York Times, Kristi Mitchem, head of the Americas institutional client group at State Street, said that the company believes that "the signal has excess return," suggesting that companies with a greater percentage of women in leadership roles would outperform companies that do not. The fund's marketing materials make references to Europe, noting that several European countries have passed legislation that requires 30% to 40% of corporate board members to be female. In the United States, just 19.2% of board seats in S&P 500 companies are held by women. The ETF hopes that "by investing in companies with gender-diverse senior leadership, SHE may inspire conversation and action to increase gender diversity in company leadership teams," according to marketing materials. Hard to draw lines Many companies exhibit business practices that may qualify them as being socially responsible, while exhibiting others that would disqualify them from the socially responsible label. Costco, frequently heralded for its generous compensation packages for even the lowest-level retail employees, was for a long time the No. 3 distributor of tobacco products. Costco is therefore a leader on socially responsible wages, but it participates tangentially in a business (tobacco) that many see as unfit for a socially responsible fund. The Parnassus fund owns shares of National Oilwell Varco, a major supplier of services and equipment to the oil and gas industries, despite the fact the fund otherwise tries to avoid companies with fossil fuel connections. Admittedly, one could argue that National Oilwell Varco's products attempt to make the industry safer and cleaner, a fair point. Funds can also take very different stances on the same company. Microsoft, which doesn't appear in Parnassus' fund because of its "competitive dynamics," according to an interview, is the second-largest holding in Vanguard's FTSE Social Index Fund. Why invest in socially responsible funds? Investors may take comfort in knowing that their investment returns aren't a result of addictive products like tobacco, or diabetes-causing sodas. Other controversial investments include publicly traded private prisons, which generate more revenue and profits when more people are incarcerated, a reality that may conflict with an investor's moral compass. There is a case to be made that limiting a fund's potential investment universe could negatively affect returns. Cigarettes and other tobacco products are a public health disaster, but a capitalist's dream. The tobacco industry produced the best stock market returns of any industry over a period spanning from 1900 to 2010.  Studies have shown that some of the strategy's cornerstones have merit. Companies whose executives make frequent personal use of carbon-spewing corporate planes underperform others. Another study found that high employee satisfaction was correlated with higher stock market returns over a 27-year period. And while nuclear power may or may not be good for humanity at large, what cannot be debated is the fact that utility stocks broadly underperformed the market average from 1927 to 2011, with greater volatility in investment returns, suggesting that portfolios that have avoided utilities -- for socially responsibility reasons or otherwise -- have outperformed by avoiding an underperforming sector of the stock market. Of course, like any investment strategy or fund type, actual results for socially responsible funds have been mixed. The reality is that more than half of all stock market funds by assets under management will necessarily underperform the average, while only a minority of assets will outperform, due in large part to the fact that the average fund's performance is reduced by fees whereas the stock market average return is not. The Parnassus Core Equity Fund trounced the returns of the S&P 500 over the last 15 years, with an annualized return of 9% compared to the index's 6.4%. Vanguard's index fund has so far been a laggard, returning an average of one percentage point less than the S&P 500 over the last 15 years.  Smart investors exist on both sides of the dividing line, and whether or not it makes sense to invest with socially responsible guidelines in mind is ultimately a personal decision. But with 150 dedicated socially responsible funds on the market in 2016, it's becoming increasingly clear that the strategy's principles are very much here to stay.

Any commentary does not necessarily reflect the views of Impunity Watch. *WARNING SOME VIDEOS MAY CONTAIN GRAPHIC IMAGES* Journal About Us Contact Us Search → NavigationNewsThe Middle EastAfricaAsiaEuropeNorth America & OceaniaSouth AmericaSpecial FeaturesSyria WatchJournalAbout UsContact Us News Published on September 18th, 2016 | by Portia Skenandore-Wheelock 0 US Prisoners Launch a Nation-wide Strike in Protest of “Prison Slavery” by Portia K. Skenandore-Wheelock Impunity Watch Reporter, North America UNITED STATES — On Friday prisoners in 40 prisons in at least 24 states went on a coordinated strike, refusing to do their assigned jobs, and are demanding an “end to prison slavery.” This is one of the largest prison strikes attempted in decades. The date of the start of the strike coincides with the 45th anniversary of the 1971 Attica prison uprising. The Industrial Workers of the World’s Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC) and the Free Alabama Movement organized and announced the strike in a statement, “Slavery is alive and well in the prison system, but by the end of this year, it won’t be anymore. This call goes directly to the slaves themselves.” Prisoners in states across the US went on strike Friday to protest the exploitation of their cheap, and sometimes even free, labor. (Photo courtesy of the Independent) As state budgets have been cut the over 2 million prisoners in the United States have been a source of cheap, and in some states free, labor. New work programs have prisoners repairing public plumbing, doing underwater welding, cleaning up roadkill, and maintaining public spaces. Prisoners’ jobs also go beyond public works and services. Corporations, such as Starbucks, Wal-Mart, Victoria’s Secret, McDonald’s, IBM, and AT&T, have tapped into prison labor by making deals with both private and public prisons. Prisoner laborers make 12 to 40 cents per hour yet the annual dollar value of their work output is estimated to run in the billions. “We want people to understand the economics of the prison system. It’s not about crime and punishment. It’s about money,” says Melvin Brooks-Ray, founder of the Free Alabama Movement and an inmate for 17 years. Since labor law does not consider prisoners employees, they are not allowed to unionize. IWOC is trying to change that and encourages prisoners to join without charging union dues. IWOC’s site says, “You cannot change this situation through a grievance process that doesn’t work…or through courts that are clearly against you…or through petitions to lawmakers who don’t care about you because you don’t vote…or through hunger strikes against prison officials who want you to starve…or through letters to newspapers who have ignored this situation for decades.” Prisoners in different states have other demands beyond fair wages for their work, such as an end to long-term solitary confinement policies, poor healthcare, poor quality of food, violent attacks, overcrowding, fairer parole policies, and reinstating educational courses for high school diplomas. “Different prisoners have different goals and aims, it’s looking like it’s going to be a state-by-state thing,” said Brianna Peril, co-chair of IWOC and a former prisoner. In response to these non-violent strikes, many prisons are engaging in lockdowns and barring prisoners’ access to communication.

Over several years, Chris collected quite a few coins — a whopping $2,500 worth, in fact. But that's not the only story here. Figuring out how to get rid of all those pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters was. "Over time it became full to the very top," Chris says. "I just left it in my garage for a year or two, since I never seemed to have the time to deal with it." When he retired from his job as store manager of a Walmart earlier this year, Chris had hip replacement surgery and decided he could deal with his massive coin problem during recovery. That's when the problems started. First he had to figure out how to get the coin out of the jug — at least 400 pounds worth. "We couldn't hit it with a hammer because the glass would be mixed in with the coins. We tried to use a hose with our wet vac and suck the coins out. That didn't work. So I called glass companies that repair car windows, and glass window installers. I hoped they'd have a way to cut the glass. I needed them to come to the house because I couldn't move the 400-pound-plus jug. No one said they could come out. "My son decided to try a long screwdriver and coat hanger to get the coins out a little at a time. After a full day he succeeded to put the coins in deep lasagna pans to support the weight." Then Chris had to figure out where to take all the loose coin. He called six banks. Most had removed their coin-counting machines. The only banks that still had counters had limits on how much you could bring. Or you had to be a customer. He tried his own bank. He'd been with them for 40 years and had six accounts. "They said they'd take the coin but I had to wrap all of it. I went to the bank but they didn't have enough wrappers. There was a demand on wrappers, so I had to go to six different banks to get enough. "Each day I spent about six hours wrapping coins by hand. I learned weekdays, 10 to 10:30 a.m., were the best times since the banks were slow then. The second week of wrapping coins I was getting close to the end and I was in my bank on routine business. I told the manager I'd likely be in the following week with my coins; he said that would be fine." But when the manager asked Chris how much he had - between $2,000 and $3,000 — he told Chris he couldn't take that much. Chris said he reminded the manager he'd been banking there for 40 years and had six accounts. Sorry, he was told. There wasn't  room. "I said the safe was huge and, wrapped, the coins didn't require much space." The frustrated Chris sarcastically told the manager "Perhaps I should take the coins every time I go shopping, the movies, out to dinner, or to the hardware store, etc. etc." The manager said he had an idea. He suggested Chris bring the coins to his bank at 9 a.m. on a Wednesday. He said he'd deposit it and give it to the bank courier so it doesn't require storage. "I said fine, I'll be there. Then he added there probably would be a service charge for handling the coin." Chris told the manager he'd spent two weeks, six hours a day, counting coin. How much would the service charge be? Chris got a phone call from the manager on Tuesday afternoon. He had more bad news. The bank courier couldn't take the coin. "He didn't have a reason. Perhaps the truck was too small. He suggested I go to eight or 10 branches around Gloucester County and give each one a few hundred dollars until the coin was gone. I said that was ridiculous." Chris decided to call the Walmart store he'd managed in Turnersville and speak to the current manager. "By now the coin was counted — $2,500. She said to bring it in and she'd exchange it for cash." Chris had come to the conclusion that to have a lot of coins is not necessarily a good thing. "I had $2,500 and couldn't do anything with it."

He becomes part of a small crowd gathering outside of one of several storefront temporary employment agencies that line the busy street. While the rest of the city is waking up, this immigrant neighborhood in the heart of Middlesex County is bustling. At 6 a.m., a gray van rumbles up to the agency Sanchez and about a dozen people silently climb inside. The van travels 30 miles south to a factory near Trenton. Rafael Sanchez, a Mexican immigrant living in the U.S. illegally, came to the U.S. in 2001 to work as a temp worker. Sanchez rents a small room built inside a garage on a dead end street in New Brunswick. (Andre Malok | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com)  For the next eight hours, Sanchez, 65, will stand at a packaging machine on an assembly line. Though he is a temp — short for  temporary worker — he has worked in this same factory for six years. The Mexico native earns $10 an hour with no paid vacation days, few benefits and little hope of ever getting a raise. After his temp agency takes out taxes, the cost of the van ride and other fees, Sanchez will take home $295 at the end of the week, according to his pay stubs. "Not enough," Sanchez says, in Spanish, with a weary smile. As an immigrant living in the country illegally, he says this is the best job he can find. The business of providing blue-collar temps to factories and warehouses is booming in New Jersey, which now has one of the largest concentrations of temp workers in the nation, according to federal statistics. The increasing demand has helped spawn what researchers call "temp towns." They are places like Union City, Elizabeth and, especially, New Brunswick, with dozens of small temp agencies and neighborhoods full of temp workers. Rafael Sanchez walks to a temp agency in New Brunswick where he will catch a van to a factory near Trenton. (Andre Malok | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com)  But New Jersey's "temp towns" have a dark side. Workers and activists say the sector of the temporary employment industry supplying blue-collar workers to warehouses and factories is rife with mistreatment. They complain about low pay or not being paid at all, rampant racial and sexual discrimination, unsafe working conditions and a system that seems to exploit them at every turn. Many temps, including Sanchez, are immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. They say the storefront temp agencies in Hispanic neighborhoods routinely overlook their illegal status and provide them with a vital link to paying jobs in New Jersey's growing network of warehouses and factories. Because few temps are willing to risk deportation by reporting mistreatment to authorities, workers say they often endure working conditions reminiscent of the troubled countries they fled. With assistance by Reveal from The Center for Investigative Reporting -- a nonprofit news organization based in California -- NJ Advance Media spoke to dozens of temp workers, temp agency recruiters, labor activists, government officials and experts over several months about the industry in New Jersey. Among the findings, which reflect a national investigation by Reveal: Racial discrimination is widespread in temp agencies supplying blue-collar workers. In New Jersey, agencies sending workers to warehouses and factories in Central and North Jersey are overwhelmingly located in Hispanic neighborhoods, according to one study. Workers allege companies prefer, and often request, Hispanic temps, who are less likely to complain about low pay or poor conditions because many of these workers are new immigrants or are living in the country illegally. Gender discrimination is rampant in the employment agencies. Women are often paid less than men in blue-collar jobs. Photos taken by New Labor, a local activist organization, show some temp agencies advertise "women's jobs" and "men's jobs," in what a Rutgers University report calls a blatant violation of federal law. Many warehouses and factories offer little, if any, safety training to temps. At least three workers have died in recent years, including a temp who was crushed while sorting packages at an Amazon fulfillment center in Woodbridge in 2013, according to U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration reports. Other New Jersey companies have been fined for exposing temp workers to hazardous chemicals, excessive noise and other dangerous conditions. Several prominent temp agencies in New Brunswick and surrounding towns appear to be operating without a license, in violation of state law, according to a check of a state database of licensed firms. When questioned about the unlicensed firms, the state Division of Consumer Affairs, which oversees licensing of temp agencies, said it would investigate. However, a department spokeswoman admitted Consumer Affairs has not investigated any temp agencies in years. Booming business While parts of the U.S. economy have struggled to recover from the recession, the temp industry is thriving. Last year, there were nearly 3 million temps employed nationwide, an all-time record, according to data from the federal Department of Labor Statistics. Other studies conducted by the temp industry say the numbers are much higher and as many as one in 10 workers nationwide is temporary. "There are more temp industry offices in the U.S. than (restaurants of) the big three burger companies —  McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's — combined," said George Gonos, a labor studies professor at Florida International University. Middlesex County alone averaged between 18,000 and 23,000 temp workers a month last year, according to federal statistics. Temp workers made up more than 6 percent of the county's workforce, nearly triple the national average. Passaic and Burlington counties also have some of the highest percentages of temp workers in the nation. While temps may bring to mind the image of the "Kelly Girl" office worker who is hired to do a few days of filing or reception work, the industry has changed. About half of temp workers nationwide work in transportation or "light industrial" jobs in warehouses and factories, according to government statistics. Temp workers gather inside one of more than a dozen temp agencies in New Brunswick. Many workers are sent to low-paying jobs in local warehouses and factories. (Andre Malok | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com)  Every time a consumer picks up something at Wal-Mart or orders something on Amazon, chances are good a temp worker has handled the merchandise. The low cost of these workers helps keep down the price of products and helps companies offer cheap, fast shipping. In New Jersey, the temp industry has been fueled by the surge of container ships bringing foreign-made goods into the Port of Newark, the second-busiest port in the nation after the combined Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. To handle the goods, companies have built giant warehouses and distribution centers near the New Jersey Turnpike. Many companies and retail chains also save money by hiring third-party logistics firms to run the warehouses, according to researchers who study the industry. The logistics firms often hire temp agencies to supply staff for the warehouses to easily increase or decrease the number of workers during busy or slow seasons. Some workers become "perma-temps," working in the same warehouse for years without getting hired as permanent employees with benefits. 'I am illegal": One temp's story Temp workers in New Jersey warehouses and factories typically earn between $8.38 (minimum wage) and $12 an hour, and have no guarantee of work every day, according to workers. In many New Jersey warehouses and factories, the temp workforce is entirely Hispanic, Gonos said. In a 2011 study, Gonos and Rutgers professor Carmen Martino mapped dozens of blue-collar temp agencies in New Brunswick, Union City, Elizabeth, Paterson, Passaic, Plainfield, Trenton and other cities. Nearly all the agencies were located in or bordering on neighborhoods with the highest percentage of Hispanic residents. Warehouse supervisors and employers want Hispanic workers, due in part to the fact that they are likely to accept low pay and difficult conditions because they are either new immigrants or are living here illegally, Gonos said. "The reason they do that is they are the most vulnerable workforce and hardworking," Gonos said. "And the temp agencies exploit them to the hilt." The New Jersey Staffing Alliance, the industry group that represents the state's temp agencies, disputes any allegations of widespread mistreatment of temporary workers. Temp firms are closely watched by several state and federal agencies and undergo regular audits by their workers' compensation insurance providers, said Elaine Balady, a spokeswoman for the New Jersey Staffing Alliance and a 30-year industry veteran. "We have to meet the standards, and I think as an industry we do," said Balady, president of the Assurance Group, a Bergen County-based temp agency, executive search and consulting firm. But Balady said there may be some temp agencies that are mistreating workers. "Like every industry, there are some people who don't follow the rules," Balady said. "NJSA doesn't support that." Hiring unauthorized workers It is unclear how many temp workers in New Jersey are immigrants living here illegally. Louis Kimmel, executive director of the New Brunswick-based worker activist group New Labor, says a large percentage of temp workers in immigrant neighborhoods turn to agencies because they are not authorized to work in the U.S. "Temp agencies set up shop basically wherever there are Latino neighborhoods in New Jersey," said Kimmel, who has spent more than 15 years advocating for temp workers. "So that's New Brunswick, Perth Amboy, Paterson, Union City, Passaic, Plainfield." Workers say it is easy to purchase forged Social Security cards or simply share stolen or fake Social Security numbers to fill out temp agency applications. Louis Kimmel, executive director of New Labor, speaks to temp workers as they marched through New Brunswick in August carrying a new mural depicting the plight of blue-collar workers in the temp industry. (Andrew Miller | For NJ Advance Media)  "That's the way everyone does it. You're able to find papers," said Carmelo Hernandez, 56, a temp worker who came to the U.S. illegally from Mexico and says he has had the same $10.25-an-hour assignment unloading trucks at a clothing company warehouse for nine years. Balady, the spokeswoman for the New Jersey Staffing Alliance, said her employment agency is among those that use E-Verify, the government's online system to check if a potential employee's name matches the Social Security number on his or her application. Some states, including Arizona, Mississippi, South Carolina and Alabama, require employers to check E-Verify before hiring someone. New Jersey is among the states that don't require employers to use E-Verify. Lyneer Staffing Solutions, a national temp agency with an office in New Brunswick, uses E-Verify and tries to confirm all its temps are in the country legally, said Bryan Smith, president of the Lawrenceville-based firm. But the process is not foolproof, he said. "All of our employees go through the full compliance and verification process," Smith said. "If people are presenting documents that are not theirs, we can't police everybody." In a 2013 lawsuit, the former director of human resources at Lyneer accused the temp agency of intentionally using and hiring "illegal and/or undocumented employees." The lawsuit was settled out of court and neither side would comment on the case. At Delta Personnel Services, president and chief executive officer Stan Lyskowski said his temp agency uses E-Verify to confirm temps are in the country legally only if a company requests it. Delta places as many as 600 temps a week out of its offices in New Brunswick, Bound Brook and Somerset, said Lyskowski, a 30-year veteran of the temp industry. Under New Jersey law, temp agencies are not required to investigate whether the social security cards and immigration documents handed over by employees are legitimate. "We certainly don't knowingly employ any illegal aliens," said Lyskowski. "If the documents presented to us look legitimate ... we process the person." From packing flowers to boxing candy Temp workers participate a march organized by the activist group New Labor in New Brunswick in August. The marchers carried new murals commissioned by the group depicting the plight of temp workers in New Jersey. (Andrew Miller | For NJ Advance Media)  The temp agencies in New Brunswick are easy to spot. They are the businesses lit before dawn year-round. Inside, there are rows of men and women sitting in folding chairs. Some look anxious. All look weary. They are waiting for their names to be called for a job for the day. The stakes are high. If their names are not called, they don't get paid. If they don't get paid too many days in a row, they can't pay their rent and they can't buy food. Some are lucky to score "perma-temp" positions, assigned to the same warehouse or factory every day for years. Others sit in the agencies daily, waiting for short-term assignments. Reynalda Cruz said she spent nearly two decades working on and off for On Target, Delta, Olympus and a long list of other local temp agencies in her New Brunswick neighborhood. Over the years, she packed flowers, boxed up candies, sorted packages, worked on an assembly line at a pharmaceutical company and did other jobs at a series of warehouses across Central Jersey. If she complained that the agency vans were overcrowded or the warehouses were unheated, or questioned whether the chemicals she was breathing were dangerous, Cruz said she usually heard the same answer. "All the jobs are the same. They say, 'You don't want it? There's someone else,'" said Cruz. Frustrated with the treatment she received daily, she left temp work a few years ago to become a community organizer with New Labor, the worker advocacy organization in New Brunswick. Some of Cruz's former employers, including On Target, did not respond to requests to comment on how they handle complaints from workers. Olympus is no longer in business. The owner of Delta Personnel Services disputed Cruz's claim that his temp agency fails to respond to workers' complaints about safety and working conditions. The agency has an extensive screening process to inspect worksites and check the safety record of companies before placing temps in warehouses and factories, said Lyskowski, Delta's owner. Delta pays more than $700,000 for worker's comp insurance each year in the event someone is injured, he said. It would be bad business to ignore the safety of temp workers and risk driving up the cost of that insurance, he added. "We pride ourselves on that," Lyskowski said. "We're going to get bit by having an inordinate amount of injuries." There is little Delta can do about worker complaints about excessive hot or cold conditions in warehouses, which are often unheated and unairconditioned, company officials said. But the agency has pulled workers out of some jobs, including a warehouse where temps complained they were required to work in a freezer without insulated suits. Delta has also removed temps from warehouses where they were asked to perform duties outside of their job descriptions, including driving forklifts, company officials added. "We've actually walked away from companies because (temps) were doing things that weren't reported to us," said Maritza Hernandez, Delta's operations manager. It is a complicated process to get workers from the street to the factory in the temp industry. Under the system, companies or logistics firms call in orders to the temp agencies for a certain number of workers. It is up to the agency to select workers. The agencies usually are paid a certain amount per worker. After paying the worker, the agencies keep the rest of the fee for expenses and profits. Because agencies do not need to explain why they choose one worker over another for an assignment, temps say discrimination often goes unchecked. Several logistics firms declined to comment on hiring practices in the industry. 'Culture of flirting' Last year, Rutgers University researchers released a study on the conditions female temp workers face in New Jersey warehouses. The study, based on interviews with dozens of temps in New Brunswick, found widespread gender discrimination and sexual harassment. New Jersey women working as temps described a "culture of flirting" in which temps who respond favorably to sexual comments or inappropriate touching from warehouse or factory supervisors are rewarded with better jobs or easier work, according to the report by Rutgers' Center for Women and Work. The women who complain about harassment risk not getting called back for assignments. So most stay silent, the study found. "They don't have other options, really. I don't think that they are willing to endure it — they have to," said Danielle Lindemann, one of the Rutgers researchers, now working as an assistant professor of sociology at Lehigh University. Women temps also were routinely paid less than men for the same assembly line work and were rarely given higher-paying forklift operator jobs, the study found. The report included photos of signs in Spanish in New Brunswick temp agencies advertising work "for men only" and lower-paying jobs "for women."  "They are doing things that are blatantly and patently illegal," Lindemann said. Activists with New Labor, the New Brunswick-based workers group, said they took the report to several agencies, including Lyneer Staffing Solutions and On Target, late last year to show managers. Some agencies let New Labor activists remove the signs, said Kimmel, the group's executive director. Representatives of On Target did not respond to requests for comment. Bryan Smith, the president of Lyneer, said he was unaware there were signs advertising men's and women's jobs in his New Brunswick branch. "That is absolutely not our policy," Smith said. Germania Hernandez, a longtime temp now working as a community organizer in New Brunswick, said it is unlikely conditions have improved for female temps since the 2015 Rutgers report highlighted the alleged abuses. Temp workers sit inside On Target Staffing, an employment agency in New Brunswick, before dawn. The agency is one of more than a dozen temp firms in the city. "Work available every day," the sign in the window says in Spanish. (Ed Murray | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com)   Hernandez, 43, said she spent years going to assignments where she had no opportunity to ask about getting one of the better-paying "men's" positions at the warehouses. "Simply, I was told to sit there. Go over here or go over there," Hernandez said through a translator. "Sometimes they didn't tell us what they were going to pay us or how many hours we were going to work. ... It was as if we were sent like a doll or something." If temp workers want to complain about agencies, it is often difficult to know where to turn. Temp agencies are overseen by a complex web of state and federal agencies, including the state Division of Consumer Affairs, the federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and both the state and federal labor departments. Under New Jersey law, a temporary agency must put up a $1,000 bond and apply for a license for each office it opens in the state. But an NJ Advance Media check of several large agencies in and around New Brunswick found at least four prominent firms that appeared to be unlicensed, according to the database of 2,200 licensed temp agencies and employment consulting companies available on the state Division of Consumer Affairs' website. When asked about the locations, a department spokeswoman confirmed the temp agencies appeared be "engaging in unauthorized activities" and would be reviewed. In 2013, Command Center, an Idaho-based temp agency, paid $27,800 in a settlement with the state after being accused of opening offices in Newark and Paterson without a license. The state began investigating when temp workers hired to do post-Hurricane Sandy cleanup work complained Command Center was not paying them as promised. In the settlement, Command Center did not admit to doing anything wrong. It has closed its New Jersey offices. Since that investigation three years ago, there have been no attempts to crack down on illegal temp agencies in New Jersey, said Lisa Coryell, a spokeswoman for the state Division of Consumer Affairs. "The division has not received complaints about any employment agency or temporary help service firm ... in recent years," Coryell said. A spokeswoman for the state Department of Labor, which investigates complaints about workers not getting properly paid, said it has no statistics on how many investigations it has done into temp agencies because it does not track cases by industry. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which oversees complaints of gender and racial discrimination, has taken temp agencies to court in several high-profile cases in Chicago. However, the number of investigations the commission has done in New Jersey is so low there are no statistics available for recent years, said Raechel Adams, EEOC's acting regional attorney for the New York district, which includes New Jersey. All workers, even those living in the country illegally, have the legal right to complain about safety hazards, discrimination or other abuses, federal officials aid. "We are absolutely interested in pursuing these kinds of cases," Adams said. "EEOC does absolutely pursue cases regardless of (immigration) status." Deaths on the job The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration – known as OSHA-- investigates workplace accidents and safety complaints. The agency started a campaign three years ago to focus on safety for temp workers. The problem is temp workers often get little or no safety training from their agency, factory or warehouse because it is unclear who is responsible for training the workers. "The temp workers are often put in the position where no one is taking responsibility," said Steven Kaplan, OSHA's assistant regional administrator for federal enforcement operations. At least three temp workers from New Jersey died on the job in recent years. Ronald Smith, of Irvington, was working for the temp agency Abacus when he was crushed in a conveyer belt at an Amazon fulfillment center in the Avenel section of Woodbridge in 2013, according to OSHA reports. Mark Jefferson, of Trenton, was a Labor Ready temp when he died in 2012 while working in extreme heat as a garbage collector for Waste Management in Hopewell Borough, the reports said. James Hoyt, a Labor Ready temp from Bogota, was killed in 2012 when he was crushed by a 2,500-pound rack of computers that tipped over while he was loading them into a truck. Hoyt's family was disappointed when OSHA fined the agency and other companies involved in the accident $2,800. "We thought it was toothless — $2,800? That's not much of a deterrent," said his brother, Mike Hoyt. "It's nobody's job to keep these people safe. It's all put on the workers. These temp workers are kind of cannon fodder." Labor Ready, Waste Management and Abacus did not respond to requests to comment on the deaths of their temp employees. Kelly Cheeseman, an Amazon spokeswoman, also declined to comment on the 2013 death of the temp employee in its Avenel warehouse. But she said temp employees make up a small percentage of Amazon's workforce. "Nearly 90 percent of employees across the company's U.S. fulfillment network are regular, full-time employees. As a way of finding high-quality permanent employees to manage variation in customer demand, we also employ seasonal associates," Cheeseman said.     In 2015, OSHA conducted 219 inspections of factories and warehouses in New Jersey and handed out $1.9 million in penalties in its effort to focus on temp safety, according to agency records. In each case, OSHA officials said they fined the company and the temp agency because both are expected to take responsibility for workplace safety. OSHA is trying to ensure "temp workers aren't falling through the cracks," said Kaplan, OSHA's assistant regional administrator. Looking for solutions Temp workers at New Labor, a worker activist group in New Brunswick, join artist Willis Humphrey in April to create banners to highlight the struggle of worker rights in New Jersey. (Noah K. Murray/NJ Advance Media for NJ.com)  Carmen Martino was working as a labor union official in the 1990s when he began to notice long lines of workers waiting to get into New Brunswick temp agencies. At the time, most temp workers in New Brunswick were African-American, Martino said. But the workforce gradually changed to  Hispanic as new immigrants arrived. Martino helped form New Labor, the activist group many temp workers turn to for help. He now studies the temp worker phenomenon as an assistant professor of professional practice at Rutgers University's School of Management and Labor Relations. Though temp workers are slowly getting more attention from government authorities, little has improved in New Brunswick, Martino said. "It feels like the conditions have deteriorated," Martino said. "It wasn't as bad in the beginning as it is now." New Labor has increased efforts to intervene when temps are not paid or face dangerous conditions. In recent years, the group said it has helped workers fight for tens of thousands of dollars in unpaid wages. But New Labor's plan to start its own nonprofit temp agency with better pay and conditions for workers was abandoned after organizers concluded they couldn't compete with less-costly temp agencies. An attempt to get agencies to sign a pledge to abide by the law and treat workers fairly also failed when only one agency expressed interest in participating. Still, Martino says he sees some hope. Earlier this year, a federal ruling opened the door for temp workers to join unions and collectively bargain alongside permanent workers. Perhaps with a union behind them, temp workers could begin to demand higher pay and better conditions, Martino said. "It's not going to be without a real struggle," he said. "Many of them are undocumented. That's a cloud that hangs over all of this. ...  The threat of being deported is real." Sanchez, the New Brunswick temp working in the warehouse near Trenton, said he holds out hope that fellow temps in New Jersey can  get past their fears and demand better treatment. He is among workers pushing for new wage-theft and sick-day laws in New Brunswick and other municipalities that protect all temp workers, including unauthorized immigrants. "Even though we are people who are here illegally, we have some rights," Sanchez said. "And that's the fight. ... We want people to recognize our rights."

The Pokemon Go Plus Bluetooth device is on sale since Friday, September 16 and many of the 500 million who have downloaded the Pokemon Go app have purchased the $34.99 Pokemon Go Plus. The Nintendo-made Pokemon Go wearable is sold out at GameStop, Amazon and Walmart. These three stores have offered the device at some point on Friday according to the Pokemon Go Plus buying guide.  Don't Miss: The Amazon Black Friday 2016 Ad New: Enter to Win a Free Pokemon Go Plus at I4U News What the Pokemon Go Plus can do was initially not completely clear. Nintendo and Niantic did not communicate all of its features and only after the first series of user reviews surfaced the full range of features became clear. Niantic has followed up on Saturday with a series of Tweets to confirm the reported functionality. One of the main indicator of the Pokemon Go Plus is the color LED in the center. Here is what the different colors means. Pokemon Go Plus Blinking Color Meanings Blue: The Pokemon Go Plus will blink blue when you encounter a PokeStop. It will flash blue without vibration if the Pokemon Go Plus is not connected to your smartphone. Green: The Pokemon Go Plus flashes green when you encounter a Pokemon that is registered in your Pokedex. Yellow: The Pokemon Go Plus will blink yellow if you encounter a Pokemon that is not currently registered in your Pokedex.  Red: You ran out of Pokeballs. Pokemon Go Plus is only throwing standard Pokeballs and is not using your Great and Ultra Balls. Red Flashes mean the Pokemon fled. White: The Pokemon Go Plus flashes white, when a Pokemon is inside a Pokeball. A white flash without vibration means you Pokemon Go Plus is not paired. Multi-Color: The LED light on the Plus Go shows multiple colors after successfully catching a Pokémon or visiting a PokéStop. The distinction between green and yellow is important to increase your capture chances. If you just push the button on the Pokemon Go Plus to throw a standard Pokeball on a Pokemon not in your Pokedex your chances are slim to capture it. The color yellow means you should pull out your smartphone and use a better ball and maybe even a raspberry, depending how rare the Pokemon is you are facing. Besides using color light for notifications, the Pokemon Go Plus also vibrates. Right now there is no option to disable vibration. The Bluetooth bracelet will vibrate when in sync with the LED light flashes when a Pokemon or PokeStop is here. Once you receive the items after pushing the button, the Go Plus will vibrate and the LED shows multiple colors. It also will vibrate along multi-color light flashes when you caught a Pokemon. A red pulse and vibration means that a Pokemon fled. An important indicator to check if your Pokemon Go Plus is connected to your smartphone. A blue flash without vibration means that the Pokemon Go Plus is paired but not connected. In case your Pokemon Go Plus flashes white, it is not even paired yet. To check if your Pokemon Go Plus is connected, push the button. If it vibrates and there is no light after pressing, it is connected. A solid red light means that you either ran out of Poke Balls, you have moved out of range of the Pokemon or PokeStop or your Item storage or Pokemon storage may be full. If the LED light on your Pokemon Go Plus is not lighting up at all you need to check the battery. Make sure it is installed properly. Removing the battery for 30 seconds will reset the Pokemon Go Plus. If that does not help, get a new battery. The Pokemon Go Plus battery is a CR2032 battery. A pack of four Energizer CR2032 sell for $5.44 on Amazon. The Pokemon Go Plus is according to the manual running up to 100 days (3 months) on single CR2032 battery. Below is the Pokemon Go Plus Quick Start Guide published by Niantic. Niantic also confirms that the Pokemon Go Plus can track distance walked for Eggs and Buddy Pokemon. This feature was a big surprise and has not been mentioned in the product descriptions ahead of the launch. This capability is the most controversial. Trainers are confused about why they have to buy the Pokemon Go Plus to enable the Pokemon Go app to track walking distance when their smartphone is locked and Pokemon Go app is running in the background. A technical clarification from Niantic is needed here.  If there is a technical reason for this, than this is fine. If it is a software problem than Niantic needs to fix their app to make it track distance in pocket mode. Niantic released hours after the Pokemon Go Plus went on sale an updated Pokemon Go app addressing issues using the Pokemon Go Plus. It is highly recommended to update to Pokemon Go 1.7.1 on iOS and 0.37.1 on Android. The Pokemon Go Plus device was rather easy to buy on Friday. Our live launch day coverage help many trainers to secure a Pokemon Go Plus. First GameStop stores offered it. You even could reserve a store pick up in the early hours of Friday. Then the GameStop online store started to sell Pokemon Go Plus Online at around noon ET. Later Amazon offered the device as well, pushing it into the bestselling video game products. Pokemon Go Plus is ranked second overall. On Saturday Pokemon Go Plus has become a hard to find item. Walmart joined the retailers that offer the Pokemon Go Plus, but is sold out since Friday like Amazon and GameStop. Find out how to find and buy Pokemon Go Plus. The Pokemon Go App has been downloaded over 500 million times. The AR game is far from dead and will be around for years. At least this is what Niantic CEO John Hanke is planning on. There will be soon real world social events that glue the trainer community together. At these events new generations of Pokemon come to live. The journey of Pokemon Go has just begun.

Pompeo for CIA job 1 hr ago (…) Close Pat Bushey Look at the figures: economic recovery now well on its way BARRY RITHOLTZ Bloomberg View Pat Bushey Sep 18, 2016 (…) × Tired of seeing surveys on articles? If you are a subscriber, simply log in or Subscribe now! Pat Bushey During the past two years, we have seen signs that wage pressure is building as the economic recovery grinds on. Enough evidence has now accumulated to suggest that it is already happening. The latest data, courtesy of the Census Bureau, which released its annual update on incomes and poverty on Tuesday, showed that median household income increased a whopping 5.2 percent in 2015 to an inflation-adjusted $56,516. As the New York Times, noted, it was “the largest single-year increase since record-keeping began in 1967.” Some killjoys will note that median household income was $57,909 in 1999. That’s true, but the dot-com crash, housing bust and the credit crisis managed to cut that a lot. Median incomes fell 2.59 percent from 2000 to 2004, before almost rebounding to the pre-crisis peak. After 2007, the collapse was greater — a 4.94 percent drop that bottomed in 2013. Story continues below video × Ignore the naysayers; the most recent numbers were a huge positive surprise, showing that incomes for all Americans are rising in a meaningful way. Unlike in recent years, when much of the gains went to an increasingly narrow group at the top of the economic strata, last year’s improvements were broad and deep. “Gains were spread across the income spectrum and by race, while women’s earnings inched closer to men’s,” Bloomberg reported. This is yet more evidence of a job market that, as we previously noted, is not getting weaker but stronger — despite the occasional disappointing number. Of particular surprise to many was that the strongest gains were found among the lowest earners. To what shall we attribute these gains? Four things deserve most of the credit: More people working: The big year-over-year change in employment, with almost 2.5 million more Americans working now than a year earlier, contributed to a meaningful change in total household income. Corporate pay increases: Some of the U.S.’s largest employers, such as McDonald’s and Wal-Mart, have played a significant role in raising incomes at the lower end of the income distribution. Wal-Mart in particular made substantial increases in wages for its lowest-paid employees. These increases stand in sharp contrast to the company’s pay policies of just a few years ago. Note that the increases are not just a public-relations effort, but due to the competitive labor environment; higher pay is needed to recruit and retain workers (and because workers demoralized by the low pay and unappealing employment conditions were hurting the shopping experience for Wal-Mart customers). Minimum wage laws: Pay increases aren’t just voluntarily; after many years of little change in state and local minimum wage laws, increases mandated by legislation are kicking. That means the lowest-paid workers have seen pay rise in a number of cities and states. Economic cycle: We are now in the latter stages of an economic recovery. Typically, we see wage pressure and inflation at some point in the cycle, although usually much earlier than this. But this isn’t the typical postwar recovery — it is a recovery from a financial crisis. These rebounds are longer and slower than others, as excesses of the credit boom must be worked off. The deleveraging process takes a long time. The latest data is unequivocally good for households; what investors need to do is consider what this might mean more broadly. Rising incomes have ramifications for inflation, Federal Reserve policy, interest rates, retail spending, auto sales and residential real estate; it might even play a part in the presidential election. More than seven years have passed since the last bear market and the Great Recession ended. The recovery has been slow and fitful, and hasn’t always been very convincing for many Americans. This improvement was a long time coming. Greet it with open arms. Follow Close Get email notifications on daily! Your notification has been saved. There was a problem saving your notification.

Ask Martha: Grow succulents, keep summer whites bright Martha Stewart 1:02 a.m. EDT September 18, 2016 When rooting from individual leaves, be sure to choose plump, firm ones that show no signs of limpness. (Photo: Bryan Gardner) 2 CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Q: How can I grow succulents? — Jillian Augello, Mahopac, New York A: Succulents, such as echeveria, aeonium and jade, are easy to root from pups (offshoots of a larger plant) or leaves. Line a seed tray with paper towels, then fill it with a moistened soil blend (equal parts perlite, sand and vermiculite). Cut off a pup with a sharp knife, and strip away the bottom leaves so one inch of stem is exposed. (Or simply remove individual leaves.) Let it sit a few days, until the cut end forms a callus. Then gently press it into the soil, water and continue to keep moist. Divide plants into individual pots when you notice new growth, in about four to six weeks — a sign that they have established roots. Q: How do I keep my white summer clothing white? — Dorothy Narciso, Fort Pierce, Florida A: First, get the items clean and bright before storing them: add 1⁄2 cup Borax or 1⁄4 cup white vinegar to the laundry, or use Arm & Hammer Super Washing Soda ($4.25, walmart.com). Or boil water with lemon halves in a large pot, then soak your linens until the water is cool. Proper storage is also key. Keep clothes in breathable cotton boxes, not cardboard; the acid in paper can cause items to yellow. TIP: Avoid storing whites in airtight plastic containers, which can trap moisture, making clothes musty. Q: Can I make vegan chocolate frosting that tastes as delicious as the real thing? — Genevieve Martinez, Madison, Wisconsin A: Swapping in coconut milk for cream in a standard chocolate-ganache recipe yields a rich dairy-free topping. Because of the high ratio of coconut milk to chocolate, the frosting will take longer to thicken, but the decadent taste and airy texture are well worth the wait. Pair the frosting with our vegan cupcake recipe, also included below. These vegan cupcakes not only look enticing, they taste delicious, too.  (Photo: Bryan Gardner) Vegan Chocolate-ganache Frosting To speed up the process, refrigerate the frosting for 45 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes, instead of allowing it to thicken at room temperature. Place 2 cups chopped semisweet chocolate (10 ounces) in a heatproof bowl. Bring 1 2⁄3 cups full-fat coconut milk (from one 13.5-ounce can) just to a boil; pour over chocolate. Let stand 2 minutes, then stir until smooth and glossy. Let cool, stirring occasionally, until thick, about 2 hours. Store in an airtight container at room temperature up to 2 days. Vegan Chocolate Cupcakes Active Time: 25 minutes Total Time: 1 hour 45 minutes Yield: Makes 12 cupcakes 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 1/3 cup unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt 1 cup granulated sugar 1/2 cup coconut oil, measured in liquid form 1 tablespoon instant espresso powder 1 cup unsweetened almond milk, room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 tablespoons cider vinegar 1 recipe Vegan Frosting 1. Heat oven to 375 F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with baking cups. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt and sugar. In a separate bowl, whisk together coconut oil, espresso powder, almond milk and vanilla. Whisk wet ingredients into dry ingredients, until combined. Quickly stir in the vinegar until incorporated. 2. Divide batter evenly between muffin cups (scant 1/3 cup per cupcake). Bake until tops spring back when lightly touched, about 18 minutes. Cool 5 minutes in pan, then transfer to wire rack to cool completely. Top cupcakes with vegan frosting (about 3 tablespoons per cupcake). Q: What’s the difference between a traditional and a quick pickle? — Ben Diamond, New York City A: A traditional pickle is made by lacto-fermentation and requires keeping the vegetables in a salt brine for a few days to months. A quick pickle is made by soaking the vegetables in a vinegar bath for as little as 30 minutes. THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE SOUR: Quick-pickling sterilizes the vegetables and prevents the spread of bacteria. Fermented pickling creates an environment in which “good” bacteria thrive. TIP: Make your scissors last longer by using them exclusively for either fabric or paper. To differentiate among multiple pairs, mark them with ribbon or pieces of washi tape.

(Julie Bennett) Print Email Joseph Goodman | jgoodman@al.com By Joseph Goodman | jgoodman@al.com AL.com Email the author | Follow on Twitter on September 17, 2016 at 11:08 PM, updated September 18, 2016 at 6:02 PM comments The enormous videoboard inside Auburn's Jordan-Hare Stadium is 190-feet long and 57-feet high. Apparently, according to Auburn, it's the largest TV in college football. That's what they like to say. Like most big toys, the videoboard might be overcompensating for something. Everyone who watches a football game in Auburn loves it, of course, and especially when they show pictures of Bo Jackson, or Cam Newton, or Alabama losing. Obviously, that last one hasn't happened much since the big TV went up before last season, but it happened on Saturday. Alabama was losing to Ole Miss by a great margin when the operators of Auburn's big TV decided to flip on the game inside the stadium. This was more than an hour before Auburn's kickoff, but already there were thousands of students and fans in their seats. Everyone cheered when Ole Miss scored a touchdown, and it was such a fun moment that one of Auburn's in-house reporters pulled out his camera inside the press box and snapped a picture. Remember that time Ole Miss led Alabama 24-10? Oh, the memories. To be Auburn in the time of Nick Saban is to appreciate the smaller joys of life. Or, put another way, it's a time to waste money on the bigger distractions. Auburn's 29-16 loss to Texas A&M on Saturday night at Jordan-Hare Stadium was Auburn's first SEC loss of the season, and there is absolutely no shame in losing to a decent SEC opponent. Texas A&M might be the third-, or fourth-, or fifth-best team in the SEC West. It's too early to know just how average they are. But Auburn, man. There's just no doubt about it after Saturday night. Not fun to watch. That big TV might need to be returned to Best Buy in Opelika, or maybe the 24-hour Wal-Mart Supercenter down on College Street. With this offense that Gus Malzahn has put together, anything that exists to show in-game highlights is worthless. Maybe Malzahn can pawn it, or trade it straight up with Louisville for quarterback Lamar Jackson's backup. Would Bobby Petrino let his backup quarterback transfer to Auburn for Auburn's 190-foot videoboard? This is the stuff you think about when you're a sportswriter during an Auburn offensive possession. Not Lamar, obviously, because he's worth way more than the $3.5 million Auburn paid for its big TV. Anyway, no amount of digital television pixels in the south end zone are going to make Auburn's current quarterbacks any better — even if they used it to break down film of their opponents for 10 hours a day after every practice. For much of the second half, Auburn's biggest offensive play was a pass interference penalty by Texas A&M's defense. Auburn rushed for four yards in the third quarter. "I really thought the third quarter was the key to the game," Malzahn said. "The offense just couldn't seize the moment." It was so frustrating to watch, and so thoroughly unproductive and pointless in its existence, that Malzahn threw his hands up in the air and put his junior college transfer quarterback into the game. Keep in mind, the kid had never completed a forward pass in Division I. But, hey, say what you want about John Franklin III, at least he was moving the ball late in the game. Not that it mattered. By that point, the game was unwinnable. "The thing about this offense, we'll improve," Malzahn said. That's a good perspective to have. Also, Auburn is 2-10 in its last 12 SEC games. Auburn has LSU at Jordan-Hare next week, and the Tigers need a conference win at home badly. Malzahn hasn't defeated an SEC opponent in Auburn since Oct. 25, 2014. That was before the big TV, of course. The Tigers, at the time ranked No.5 in the country, outgunned South Carolina 42-35. Gone are the days, right? Since that victory, it was five consecutive losses at home to conference teams before Texas A&M. Auburn's first loss of the streak was to the Aggies. This second home loss in a row to Texas A&M is now the sixth overall at home against SEC opponents. Most importantly, for reasons that should be obvious to everyone by now, Auburn hasn't won a home game against an SEC opponent since that big videoboard was erected. Maybe it's cursed. No, just really difficult to watch. "We got to have explosive plays," Malzahn said. "We've got to figure out how to have explosive plays."

Dameian J. Marlow, 18, of 800 Onondaga Ave., Syracuse, and a 17-year-old boy were each charged with second-degree robbery, fourth-degree conspiracy, petit larceny, and second-degree harassment. The sheriff's office did not identify the 17-year-old and said its policy is not to name people charged with a crime if they are less than 18 years old. At 9:46 p.m. Thursday sheriff's deputies responded to the Wal-Mart store at 819 Bennie Road in the town of Cortlandville for a reported robbery. A 19-year-old man was walking to work at Wal-Mart when he was hit in the head and lost consciousness. He could feel someone trying to take his cell phone from his back pocket when he woke, the sheriff's office said. Two suspects took the phone and ran off. Deputies got a description of the suspects from the victim, the sheriff's office said. Marlow and the 17-year-old were found nearby soon after and arrested. They were arraigned in Cortlandville Town Court and each held at the Cortland County jail in lieu of $10,000 bail or $20,000 bond.

Done Editing Tags 54 Comments Share this article 70 70 70 This Election Day, Massachusetts voters will be voting on whether to lift the state’s cap on the number of charter schools allowed to open. A recent poll showed 48 percent of voters opposed to lifting the cap and planning to vote no on question two, while 41 percent were in favor. Dozens of local school committees, along with the state Democratic party, have already voted to oppose the measure.  But despite this widespread opposition, there’s a very real chance the measure will pass, for one simple reason: money. Wealthy opponents of public education are pouring money into the state. Walmart heirs Jim and Alice Walton have given a combined $1.8 million. Hedge funders and bankers have given hundreds of thousands of dollars more. In fact, the pro-charter camp has put $11 million into this fight, much of it from out of state. By contrast, the major committee opposing the measure, Save Our Public Schools, has raised $6.8 million, most of it from unions representing Massachusetts teachers. As if to drive the point home what kind of a fight this is, the charter backers have hired the ad firm that did the 2004 Swift Boat Veterans for Truth ads. One notable Massachusetts donation supporting charter schools over public schools came from Paul Sagan, the Republican-appointed chair of the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, who gave $100,000. But he wants us to believe him when he says his thumb isn’t on the scale. All of this in a state with some of the best public schools in the country—schools that are increasingly struggling to handle the funding drain charters create. In one “historically well-funded” local school system: With almost $1.1 million last year following 90 secondary students – an average of 15 students per upper grade – to nearby charter schools, 37 staff positions were cut over the last three years to balance the budget. That's teachers, paraeducators, administrators, custodians. In recent years, computer instruction and physical education were cut from the middle school. High-school class sizes, historically in the low twenties, are now up to thirty students. Delayed building-maintenance runs into the hundreds of thousands. Several world languages have been eliminated, while, in the next town over, an immersion-language charter school is expanding.  That means all the students in the public schools are losing out because a relatively few students left. And that’s in a school district that wasn’t already struggling, as poorer districts are. Last spring, Boston students walked out of classes to protest the funding cuts their schools already face in large part due to the charter drain.  The big-money backers of Question 2 want to see that effect doubled or tripled in every town in the state. No wonder all those local school committees are opposed to this attack on their schools. 54 Comments Share this article 70 70 70 54 Comments Comment Settings Close Settings Auto refresh Collapse on load Show hidden Show until I hide Comments are closed on this story.

Kim LaCapria Sep 19, 2016 Share - - Claim: A woman had a dead kitten surgically removed from her vagina after inserting it to simulate the feeling of being pregnant. false Example: [Collected via e-mail, September 2016] I keep seeing an article about a woman who placed a kitten inside her vagina and it was removed at the ER. They claimed she did it because she felt like she wanted to give birth. Is this true? Origin:On 20 March 2016, the Now8News web site published an article reporting that a woman claiming to be pregnant and in distress had a dead kitten removed from her vaginal canal in the emergency room: Police were called out to a Las Vegas hospital today after a woman entered the emergency room screaming, “Help my baby.” The 38-year-old woman, Janice Warmington, entered the East Las Vegas hospital complaining of pains in her stomach, telling the nurses she was in her first trimester of pregnancy. They immediately placed her in one of the emergency room beds and performed an ultrasound examination. What doctors found, was absolutely repulsive and shocking. “We began with an ultrasound examination so we could see the condition of the baby,” said attending physician Robert Steinberg. “However, what we saw on the screen had us confused so we proceeded with a vaginal examination. What we pulled out of her ... I’ve never experienced in my 32 years in the medical field.” Steinberg said they retrieved a kitten from Warmington’s vaginal cavity. And when they pulled it out, the woman went even more insane. Warmington reportedly told the nurses that she is unable to have children and just wanted to “Feel what it was like to have a living being… life, moving around inside of her.” The report was reproduced by dozens of fly-by-night "viral news sites" after its initial appearance: The article (like all of Now8News' content) was entirely fabricated. Now8News is a clickbait fake news site that masquerades as a local television news outlet's web presence. The photograph purportedly depicting the dead kitten in a surgical environment was in fact a stock image of surgeons' tools, blurred to suggest the original photo contained something graphic (it did not): Previous Now8News hoax articles (often replicated by other "viral news" sites) include similar claims a man had sexual relations with a pig in a Walmart bathroom, aborted fetuses were discovered in McDonald's Chicken McNuggets, Walmart bananas were contaminated with a deadly parasitic worm, a woman engaged in a sex act with a sausage at a Walmart, a separate woman was arrested for sampling feminine hygiene items in an aisle at a Walmart, a man fed his unfaithful fiancee's remains to her unsuspecting parents, and a woman gave birth to twins in a casket after being buried alive by her husband.  Originally published: 19 September 2016 Tags: now8news Kim LaCapria Kim LaCapria is a New York-based content manager and longtime snopes.com message board participant. Although she was investigated and found to be "probably false" by snopes.com in early 2002, Kim later began writing for the site due to an executive order unilaterally passed by President Obama during a secret, late-night session (without the approval of Congress).

Video by Time Kmart is closing 64 stores as it sheds unprofitable locations. (Photo: Frank Franklin II, AP) Kmart, the mass-merchandise retail chain struggling with listing sales, is going to close 64 stores across the U.S., a person familiar with the matter said Monday. Liquidation sales will begin on Sept. 22, and the stores will close their doors in mid-December, according to the person,who did not want to be named because they were not allowed to say so publicly. It is the latest round of cuts by the retailer. Its parent company, Sears Holdings, said in April that it would close 68 Kmart stores this summer. Both Sears and Kmart have had a difficult time remaining profitable and competitive in a retail environment increasingly dominated by other mass market chains and e-commerce sites like Amazon. USA TODAY Here's where the 64 Kmart stores are closing The latest closures include 17 stores that were among 235 sold last year by Sears Holdings to Seritage. The deal included a provision that allowed Sears Holdings to lease those locations back from Seritage, but to have the option to vacate the lease if the store was losing money. "As such, we have informed Seritage that we will soon be exiting 17 Kmart stores,'' says Sears Holdings spokesman Howard Riefs. "We have been strategically and aggressively evaluating our store space and productivity, and will be accelerating the closing of unprofitable stores as we have previously announced.'' Kmart and Sears are hardly the only traditional brick-and-mortar retailers who are struggling. Macy's said last month that it would close 100 of its 675 full line locations because of dwindling profits. Sports Authority is shutting all of its 460 stores after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. And Walmart said in January that it was shuttering 269 locations across the globe. USA TODAY Top retailers that are closing stores in 2016 Sears has been shedding real estate to come up with cash, but dwindling sales have still taken a toll. In the second quarter that ended July 30, the company posted a loss of $395 million, compared to a $208 million profit in that same three month period a year before. Meanwhile, sales at Sears and Kmart stores open at least 12 months declined 5.2% during the period. Still, that was an improvement over the drop seen in the previous quarter.

Unlike in the Bay Area, where water wasters are publicly named and shamed, the so-called "Wet Prince of Bel Air" has remained a secret since Los Angeles County officials confirmed someone in the tony neighborhood was using 11.8 million gallons of water annually. The news was met with such outrage that local residents began patrolling the neighborhood to try to figure out which house was the culprit. Vigilante gangs and LA officials have yet to unveil the name of the mega-user, so CIR used a system of "satellite images, an algorithm developed to track drought and deforestation, and equations used in landscape planning" to find the seven most likely candidates. Related Stories Water-hog list includes Giants’ Buster Posey, Motley Crue singer A’s Billy Beane near top of East Bay water hogs list High on the list is Guber, whose Lausanne Road complex sits on nine acres of "jungly" vegetation. The house itself is 14,000 square feet and the property includes a pool, tennis court and private road to the Hotel Bel-Air. At the very least, CIR estimates the property uses between 2.8 million and 5.5 million gallons of water per year. By comparison, when Giants catcher Buster Posey was busted for water-wasting in 2015, his home was using 1.2 million gallons per year. Other likely Wet Prince candidates according to CIR include former Univision CEO Jerrold Perenchio, Wal-Mart heiress Nancy Walton Laurie and Beny Alagem, owner of the Beverly Hilton Hotel. Guber's fabulous wealth derives from his role as the co-founder and CEO of Mandalay Entertainment. He also co-owns the Dodgers and Los Angeles FC.  CIR reached out to Guber about his home's water usage; a spokesperson for Guber asked for more details about their research but did not give an official comment.

A hero empowerment center made a loud entrance into the Hickory Ridge Mall on Monday. Heal the Hood foundation created the center and helped get it open. It contains everything from a state of the art recording studio to a video editing site where children can make their own music videos. "We also have a digital technology for comic book and graphic design," Heal the Hood's Ladell Beamon said. Organizers said the new center is a place where children can learn to be a hero not a villain. They hope the center is a place where children can turn away from guns and drugs.  "I love it. I absolutely love it," Erica Jackson said. The center is entirely funded by donations. Hard Rock Café, Guitar Center, and even Walmart donated equipment and money. Now organizers say it's time to bring some heroes back to Memphis. "Gotham has batman. Metropolis has superman. Why not develop our own hero here in the city of Memphis?" Beamon said. The Hickory Ridge Mall location is just one of seven locations Heal the Hood plans to open in Memphis. The other locations have not yet been released to the public. The center will be open whenever the mall is open. Click here for more details on the center. Copyright 2016 WMC Action News 5. All rights reserved.

The market for the product would include government contractors of various types as well as freelance operators. The first step is to rent a virtual space at a legitimate-sounding address, preferably in Silicon Valley (to convey high-tech street cred). Next, incorporate online in Liberia, the legal home to many legitimate companies like Miami-based Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines. It’s easy and quick and may have certain unspecified advantages when tax time comes. What about funding? Thanks to the JOBS (Jumpstart Our Business Startups) Act of 2012, finding investors online through various crowdfunding sites is easy. Contract programmers to write the app can be hired via Upwork and several other sites. A manufacturer for the drone itself can almost certainly be secured at Alibaba.com, which includes a vast selection of remote control aircraft vendors in China. Square is a user-friendly payments company that allows anyone with a smartphone or tablet computer to accept credit card payments. Finally, Shipwire will pick up the products from the dock in Long Beach, warehouse them and distribute them to users. With a few clicks, you can be an entrepreneur. READ MORE: Column: The rise and fall of the U.S. corporation You might want to go further. Silicon Valley firms almost inevitably have a mythic origin story about the exact coffeehouse in San Francisco where the idea originated or the garage in Palo Alto where the prototype was built. It’s easiest to hire an online “creative” contractor to generate an appropriate fable. If you want to further burnish your marketability, consider renting a defunct brand name like RCA or Westinghouse for your product, which the older members of the public might vaguely remember and trust. This scenario is not entirely fanciful. Remember how Michael Dell started a computer company in his dorm room and ultimately grew it to be the best-selling brand in the U.S.? Today, almost anyone with a credit card and a web connection can create an enterprise without leaving their dorm room, as the barriers to entry have collapsed in industry after industry. In many sectors it no longer pays to be big and integrated; in others, large-scale generic producers are happy to serve anyone, allowing new competitors to test the waters and rent expanded capacity as needed. The ability to rent assets and use contract employees allows firms to be tiny and nimble, yet large in impact. Vizio grew to be the bestselling brand of LCD televisions in the U.S. by 2010, beating Samsung and far outpacing Sony, by offering low-cost TVs assembled by a Taiwanese partner and sold through big-box retailers like Costco. Just as Michael Dell realized that PCs were composed of off-the-shelf components with a superflulous brand name, Vizio’s founder recognized that anybody could make a flat-screen TV, and the lowest-cost producer with the best distribution would win. Unlike Dell, however, Vizio chose not to invest in assets or employees: It had fewer than 200 workers when it surpassed Sony, and even today, as it has expanded into sound equipment and laptop computers, it has only 400 employees — about as many as a typical Walmart superstore. The Flip video camera also grew rapidly from its invention in 2007 to 2009, when it had become a must-have accessory for millennials. With just 100 employees, it had the largest market share in its industry thanks to its clever design and marketing. Cisco bought the company in 2009; two years later, it was closed because Flip was obsolete: Many people who would buy a Flip already had a smartphone that could do much the same thing. Flip was the corporate equivalent of a pop-up restaurant. At four years from birth to market dominance to obsolescence, Flip was much more efficient than Eastman Kodak, which took well over a century and tens of thousands of career employees to follow this same trajectory. Compare Vizio and Flip with their better-known competitor, Sony. Sony is one of the most storied brand names in history, known around the globe for products like the Walkman and the Trinitron television. But with 150,000 employees, billions in assets and expensive real estate in Tokyo, Sony is costly to maintain and has lost many billions in its electronic business. (It fares much better in life insurance, movies and music.) A chorus of financial analysts has urged the company to quit the electronics industry entirely. As one analyst put it in 2013, “Electronics is its Achilles’ heel, and in our view, it is worth zero… In our view, it needs to exit most electronics markets.” Shortly after this report, Sony sold its personal computer business and exiled its television business to a subsidiary. Sony was fitfully exiting the electronics business, just as its analysts asked. Whereas Blockbuster had 83,000 employees and 9,000 physical stories at its height, Netflix today has only 2,200 employees and rents server capacity from Amazon. But the music business faces the same form of lightweight competition. Stockholm’s X5 Music Group, with just 43 employees, produced 13 of the top 50 selling classical albums in 2010 — about the same as Universal, the industry’s heavyweight. The company licenses the rights to performances owned by smaller classical music labels and virtually “packages” them into compilations for sale online via iTunes and Amazon. With no need for physical product, the company can be radically tiny, yet large in its impact. And unlike Sony and Universal, it does not require corporate jets or skyscrapers. Similarly, whereas Blockbuster had 83,000 employees and 9,000 physical stories at its height, Netflix today has only 2,200 employees and rents server capacity from Amazon. The ability to rent assets and use contract employees allows firms to be tiny and nimble, yet large in impact. In 1977, sociologists John Meyer and Brian Rowan wrote that “the building blocks for organizations come to be littered around the societal landscape; it takes only a little entrepreneurial energy to assemble them into a structure.” At the time they wrote the article, this was poetic and almost whimsical. Today, it is descriptively accurate. READ MORE: Column: When corporations were a source of greater equality A corporation was once a social institution, with a mission and members and boundaries that separated the inside from the outside. Today it is more like a webpage. What do I mean by this? Right-click on a webpage and choose “View page source.” The pleasing coherence of the visual design you saw is replaced by pages of unreadable code. Much of the code is essentially instructions that say: “Go to the database located at the following address and pull an image from here to place in the following location; go to this other database and pull some text from there.” It is a series of calls on outside resources that are brought together just in time to convey the image that you see. Vizio, Flip and scores of other contemporary enterprises are a lot like this: not an enduring social institution with members and obligations, but a webpage. Gerald Davis Jerry Davis is the Wilbur K.

Resend activation e-mail Cars Technica / All things automotive General Motors pledges 100% renewable power for its facilities by 2050 The project expands on GM’s promise to change 125MW of energy use to renewables by 2020. by Megan Geuss - Sep 19, 2016 9:25 pm UTC Login to bookmark A GM assembly plant in Janesville, Wisconsin. Cliff Last week, GM announced a plan to move its 350 facilities in 59 countries to renewable energy by 2050. The auto company has been one of the more pioneering players among the world’s top automakers when it comes to reducing fossil fuel consumption. GM is responsible for the Volt and the upcoming all-electric Bolt, which will have more than 238 miles of range and will cost somewhere around $30,000 to $35,000 after federal and state incentives have been applied. Those two factors make the Bolt the only car in production from a major manufacturer that could rival the also-upcoming and all-electric Tesla Model 3. (And GM does have a history of building electric vehicles, too—its 1995 EV1 was the first high-volume production electric vehicle in the US.) Beyond electric cars (since GM also makes a lot of gas-guzzlers as well), the company previously pledged that 125 megawatts of the total energy its facilities consume yearly would come from renewable resources by 2020. GM said last week that it was ahead of schedule on this promise and would exceed the goal later this year when a 30MW solar array at the Jinqiao Cadillac assembly plant in Shanghai came online. GM said it also has “22 facilities with solar arrays, three sites using landfill gas, and four that will soon benefit from wind.” According to GM's press release in 2015, the company "required 9 terawatt hours of electricity to build its vehicles and power its offices, technical centers, and warehouses around the world." GM's pledge to go 100 percent renewable by 2050 makes it one of several dozen large companies that have made a similar pledge, from Walmart, to Unilever, to Apple. Moving to 100 percent renewable energy by 2050 will take a considerable investment in resources, but GM also noted that it would be able to solve the problem of intermittency (the fact that the sun can't generate electricity at night and wind can't generate electricity when the wind isn't blowing) by using batteries produced for the Volt. The company is already doing this at its Milford Proving Ground Data Center. Battery storage is considered key to adopting solar and wind power, and companies like Daimler and Nissan are already outlining plans to repurpose their electric vehicle batteries rather than recycle them.
